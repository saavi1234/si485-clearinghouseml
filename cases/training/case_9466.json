    "summary": "<p>On January 16, 2003, a taxpayer whose juvenile nephew was a ward of the court filed this lawsuit in the Alameda County, California, Superior Court. The plaintiff filed under state law against the director of the California Youth Authority (CYA). She alleged that the CYA expended funds on policies, procedures, and practices that were illegal under state law. Represented by counsel from the Prison Law Office, from Disability Rights Advocates, and from two major firms, she sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit the allegedly illegal expenditures and prevent the CYA from subjecting its wards to illegal conduct. She also sought attorneys' fees and continuing jurisdiction by the court until the CYA complied with remedial orders. The CYA generally denied her allegations. Discovery proceedings occurred for the following several months.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff's complaint, as amended in September 2003, alleged that the CYA failed in its statutory duties to provide training, treatment and rehabilitation to juvenile wards entrusted to CYA care. These shortcomings included failing to provide for juveniles' safety and subjecting wards to excessive force from staff and sexual assaults from other wards, female-on-female violence, gang violence, and staff-encouraged fights. The plaintiff also alleged that the segregation of wards for conduct reasons involved CYA placement of some individuals in inhumane, filthy, stultifying housing conditions (a) lacking programs to train improved behaviors or to improve mental health problems, and (b) which promoted mental illness and suicide. Relatedly, the plaintiff alleged that CYA wards were denied adequate medical, dental, and mental health care. Deficient or absent educational, substance abuse, exercise, religious, grievance and access to courts programs, at inadequate CYA physical facilities, were among these allegations. The plaintiff asserted that developmentally disabled, cognitively impaired, and sensory impaired CYA wards were denied basic care, physical accommodations, and necessary staffing and were subject to discrimination and harassment. The plaintiff also cited sex discrimination by the CYA in its disparate provision of college classes and vocational training to female wards, in comparison to male wards. The plaintiff's complaint repeatedly quoted from CYA budget and Inspector General reports and documents to bolster her assertions. The plaintiff's complaint did not rely on federal law; instead, she cited dozens of provisions of California's constitution, civil law, and penal code in support of her claims.</p>\r\n<p>The parties agreed that experts would review the CYA's performance in several topical areas. The experts' reports were made available to the plaintiff and the public in early 2004.</p>\r\n<p>The parties entered into a consent decree in early November 2004. It required improving CYA shortcomings in multiple respects, including safety, staff training, classification, grievance systems, religious services, gang-related violence issues, verbal abuse, physical facilities, program access, mental health, education, sex offender treatment, and accommodations for youth with disabilities. The decree called for detailed remedial plans addressing these topics to be filed with the court by January 31, 2005, and implemented by the CYA, for interim plans and improvements in the meantime, and for appointment of a Special Master compensated by CYA funds to monitor remedial compliance. The decree obligated the CYA to retain independent experts in the areas needing remediation and to provide them, and plaintiff's counsel, with access to CYA facilities. Disputes arising under the terms of the decree would be settled by arbitration. Attorneys' fees would be paid by the CYA. Judge Ronald M. Sabraw accepted the consent decree and entered judgment on December 29, 2004.</p>\r\n<p>In succeeding months and years, numerous evaluative reports were filed with the court, as well as Special Master's reports on CYA performance and compliance. Of note, the CYA's name changed during this period, becoming the Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. An agreed-upon delay in filing the remedial plans until November 2005, stemmed from the parties' desire to comprehensively remedy systemic problems at DJJ, which required improvements in adult institutions, as well. By November 2006, remedial plans were being implemented covering education, sex behavior treatment, disabilities issues, and medical care, new leadership existed at key DJJ posts, and institutional change was underway, according to the Special Master, who observed mixed progress and DJJ resource limitations.</p>\r\n<p>In August 2011, a federal judge issued an order finding that the DJJ was still in violation of its duties to provide education and programming to wards housed in its facilities. The Court granted a motion for enforcement and set deadlines for the DJJ to comply with its obligations under the Remedial Plan.</p>\r\n<p>The Special Master in the Farrell case continued to file periodic reports detailing the changes in conditions for wards at Department of Juvenile Justice facilities, until the case was dismissed with prejudice by stipulation on February 25, 2016. The parties stipulated to dismiss the case because DJJ had substantially satisfied every obligation under the remaining remedial plans in effect. The case is now closed.</p>\r\n<p>This case is similar to three other cases in this database which were brought, in part, by the Prison Law Office to challenge conditions in California juvenile facilities. Those cases are <a href=\"../../../../case/9750/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hixson v. Hope,</a> <a href=\"../../../../case/9754/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Porter v. Speirs</a>, and <a href=\"../../../../case/9759/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Waters v. Woodford</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Post-Script: Farrell's Role in Ending Solitary Confinement of Children in California</p>\r\n<p>Farrell played an important role in broad institutional reform in the criminal justice system in California. The litigation spawned an advocacy movement that eventually prompted California to pass legislation to greatly reduce the use of solitary confinement in juvenile facilities in 2018. See CAL. WELF. &amp; INST. CODE &sect; 208.3 (2018).The role the Farrell litigation played in these reforms is highlighted in Sue Burrell and Ji Seon Song's 2019 article on \"Ending 'Solitary Confinement' of Youth in California\" in the Children's Legal Rights Journal, which is attached as a resource on this page.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n  Over the past 5 months, the parties and several of their jointly selected experts have \nfocused much of their attention on revising and amplifying DJJ’s November 30, 2005 Safety \nand Welfare and Mental Health remedial plans.  The final versions of these remedial plans are \ndue to be filed with the court by June 30, 2006.1   \nThe Special Master’s last report assessed DJJ’s compliance with the “interim \nmeasures” provisions of the original Consent Decree and the parties’ January 31, 2005 \nStipulation Regarding California Youth Authority Remedial Efforts (“January 31 \nStipulation”).  Most of those provisions were superceded by the parties’ November 30, 2005 \nStipulation Regarding Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan and Mental Health Care Remedial \nPlan (“November 30 Stipulation”).   Section II.A addresses Consent Decree provisions that \nhave not been superceded, i.e., intake criteria and project management.  It also provides \nfollow-up information on two superceded issues, i.e., use of force and restricted programs.  \n  When the parties negotiated the November 30 Stipulation, they were at an impasse \nover the interim measures that the Consent Decree and the January 31 Stipulation required \nDJJ to improve some conditions for DJJ youth pending the development of the longer-range \nreform plans.  During the preceding year, DJJ had struggled with the interim measures and \nmade little progress towards improving conditions. 2  Plaintiff attributed the limited actions \nand progress to incompetence and recalcitrance.  In the second half of 2005, DJJ’s new \n                                                 \n1 This report was provided to the parties in draft in early June 2006.  Revisions based on their comments are \nbeing entered in July 2006.  Necessary updates are added by footnote.  The Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan \nwas filed July 10, 2006 after the parties agreed to extend the deadline to that date.  The parties extended the \ndeadline to file the Mental Health Plan to July 31, 2006. \n2  See, First Report of Special Master, Compliance with Interim Measures Provisions of Consent Decree and \nJanuary 31, 2005 Stipulation (“First Report of the Special Master”) for an assessment of the progress. \n  1\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nleadership acknowledged some past mistakes and failures, but asserted that chief among them \nwas the prior leadership’s underestimation of what it would take even to begin to ameliorate \nthe conditions in DJJ facilities that were the basis for the Consent Decree.  As a result, they \nsaid, the prior leadership had agreed to interim measures that could not be implemented and to \nchanges and improvements that were beyond reach in the near-term.  The parties resolved \ntheir impasse by agreeing that jointly selected experts would outline the steps that DJJ could \nand should take to address the conditions that plaintiff had targeted in the original interim \nmeasures provisions.  In Part II.B of this report, the Special Master assesses the progress that \nhas been made towards the development and implementation of new “interim” plans.    \nAlthough DJJ, in consultation with the parties, the Special Master and many experts is \nstill refining its Safety and Welfare and Mental Health remedial plans to be filed by June 30, \n2006,3 its remedial plans to improve sexual behavior treatment programs, disability access \nand education have been in place for a year or more.  The experts for those areas have \ncompleted their first comprehensive reviews of DJJ’s progress towards compliance.  The \nexperts’ reports, with findings and recommendations for further action, are appended to this \nreport.   The Special Master and Monitor also have reviewed the experts’ reports and their \nassessments of DJJ’s progress in those areas are presented in parts III, IV and V of this report.  \n  Finally, over the past six months, DJJ has continued the work of developing core \nhealth services policies and procedures which are expected to be completed in June 2006.  \nThe Consent Decree medical experts have been focused on supporting that effort, reviewing \ndrafts and providing feedback.  It appears that the effort has been successful, and that DJJ is in \n                                                 \n3 The dates were extended to July 10 and July 31, 2006 respectively. \n  2\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\na position to schedule the necessary labor negotiation processes and to move towards \nimplementation.   The medical experts also have focused on developing the standards and \ncriteria for determining compliance with the Health Care Services Remedial Plan.  The \nmedical experts will begin on-site audits and compliance reporting this summer. \nII.  INTERIM MEASURES \n  A.  Consent Decree Interim Measures \n    1.  Follow-Up On Use Of Force And Restricted Program\nIn late 2004, as a part of its interim measures to exercise central oversight over the use \nof force, DJJ modified its use of force policies and procedures and created the Department \nForce Review Committee (“DFRC”).  The DFRC, however, did not begin functioning until \nMarch 2006.4  Since then, it has met monthly and it is scheduled to continue to meet \nmonthly.5   An AGPA-level Department Use of Force Coordinator is being trained to review \nand analyze the Institutional Force Review Committee and underlying use of force reports and \nto make appropriate referrals for DFRC review.6  Consent Decree expert Barry Krisberg will \nreview the DFRC proceedings and process this year.  DJJ is taking some steps to standardize \nand improve the methods by which reports of uses of force are collected and reviewed.7\nThe Special Master’s last report noted that, in March 2006, N.A. Chaderjian had \nachieved a schedule providing a minimum of 3 hours out of cell time to all youth on the \nSpecial Management Program (“SMP”).  This was achieved by giving all SMP youth a three-\nhour time slot in the recreation “SPAs” or “cages.”  Youth receiving out-of-cell education \n                                                 \n4 Statement, Steve Cambra at May 23, 2006 meeting with DJJ.  \n5 Ibid. \n6 Ibid. \n7 See, Appendix A, May 1, 2006 Director DJJ directive to Superintendents and Security Chiefs. \n  3\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nand/or counseling had the opportunity for more than 3 hours out of their cells.  In April, \nrecreation time was reduced to 1 hour due to damage to some of the “SPAs.”  As a result, the \nnine of twenty-five youth who were on the most restricted program in the SMP were allowed \nout of their cells for only 1 hour per day.8  \n2.  Revised Intake Criteria \nThe Consent Decree provides that DJJ must  “develop formal criteria for accepting \nwards into the CYA pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 736.” This was to be \ndone by November 2004.  The Consent Decree further prohibits DJJ from accepting “more \nwards than can be materially benefited by the CYA’s reformatory and educational discipline” \nand it prohibits DJJ from accepting “wards for whom the CYA does not have adequate \nfacilities.”  The Consent Decree also requires DJJ to comply with California Code of \nRegulations, Title 15 §§ 4171, 4184 and 4184.5.9   \nJuvenile court judges have legislatively limited discretion to commit youth to DJJ, and \nDJJ has legislatively limited discretion to accept commitments.10  DJJ is required to accept \nany youth referred to it  “if it believes that the person can be materially benefited by its \nreformatory and educational discipline, and if it has adequate facilities to provide that care.”11  \n“A person will be materially benefited when there is reasonable possibility that his likelihood \nto commit delinquent behavior can be significantly reduced or eliminated within the \n                                                 \n8 Special Master’s interviews of staff at Sacramento Hall, N. A. Chaderjian, April 11, 2006.  The Special Master \ndid not attempt to quantify out-of-cell hours for the rest of the 25 youth, all of whom had recreation time reduced \nfrom 3 hours/day to 1 hour/day. \n9 Consent Decree, ¶ 7.f.  The regulations purport to implement Welf. & Inst. §§ 736, 780 and 1712 and concern \nacceptance and rejection of youth referred and the return of youth to the referring counties.  The text of the \nstatues and regulations cited herein is attached as Appendix H. \n10 Welf. & Inst. C. § 1736. \n11 Welf. & Inst. C. § 736. \n  4\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nconfinement time and jurisdiction time available.”12  DJJ is required to accept youth who are \n“borderline psychiatric or borderline mentally deficient cases,” or certain types of “sex \ndeviate[s]” and youth who “suffer [] from a primary behavior disorder” without regard to \n“material benefit” as long as  “staff and institutions are available.”13  \nEven after it has accepted a youth, DJJ may return him or her to the committing court \nif he or she “appears to be an improper person to be received by or retained in any institution \nor facility under [its] jurisdiction [] or to be so incorrigible or so incapable of reformation \nunder the discipline of any institution or facility under [its] jurisdiction [] as to render his or \nher retention detrimental to [its] interests . . .”  DJJ remains responsible for the committed \nyouth unless and until the committing court vacates the commitment.14  \nThe parties differ in their interpretations of these statutes, particularly as to the \nmeaning of “material benefit” and “adequate facilities” and as to DJJ’s responsibility to \nreferring juvenile courts and their counties.  DJJ is committed to proceeding according to its \ninterpretation of the statutes and plaintiff will evaluate the results.  Plaintiff may in the future \ninvoke the dispute resolution procedures under the Consent Decree on this issue.15  Expert \nKrisberg will add to the parties’ information by studying a sample of youth accepted this year. \nAs discussed in the Special Master’s last report, DJJ had developed draft \nintake/rejection criteria to divert youth with serious health conditions and disabilities for \nwhom DJJ could not provide appropriate care and who would not be able to participate \nmeaningfully in DJJ treatment and rehabilitation programs even with reasonable \n                                                 \n12 Title 15, § 4171. \n13 Welf. & Inst. C. § 736. \n14 Welf. & Inst. C. § 780. \n15 Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan (July 10, 2006), p. 60. \n  5\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\naccommodations.  The draft criteria were provided to plaintiff and the Special Master in \nNovember 2004.  DJJ’s Medical Director reported that he informally applied those criteria to \ndeflect admissions in a few cases in 2005.  After a period of inaction on the issue and a \nchange in leadership, DJJ committed to collaborate with state and local stakeholders to \nfinalize these criteria by March 2006.16  As of June 2006, the draft criteria had not yet been \nfinalized.17  \nIn its November 30, 2005 proposed Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan, DJJ disclosed \nfuture plans to work with state and local partners to improve the assessments of youths’ risks \nand needs and to effectuate their placement in appropriate programs based on those risks and \nneeds.  DJJ anticipates that the initial assessments eventually will be accomplished in the \ncounties before commitment to DJJ, and inform placement decisions.  In the interim, DJJ will \nclarify policies and procedures governing commitments and begin to collaborate with state \nand local entities so as to limit DJJ’s population to youth who both pose a risk to their \ncommunities such that secure confinement is necessary and whose rehabilitation and \ntreatment needs are within DJJ’s capacity to address.18  \n3.  Project Management And Quarterly Reporting \n  The Consent Decree requires DJJ to “hire a project manager to manage the remedial \nplans resulting from this Decree.”  The project manager is required to “be at the CEA I level, \nor equivalent Exempt level, with support as necessary to manage the successful development \n                                                 \n16 Defendant’s Proposed Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan (November 30, 2005), p. 31.  The Special Master \nattended a meeting of state and county stakeholders convened by DJJ to discuss its draft on acceptance and \nrejection considerations and criteria on February 22, 2006. \n17 The Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan (July 10, 2006) (p. 60) provides that DJJ would finalize the criteria and \nacceptance/rejection process for these youth by September 1, 2006.  \n18 See, Defendant’s Proposed Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan (November 30, 2005), Intake Section; Safety \nand Welfare Remedial Plan (July 10, 2006), p. 60-61. \n  6\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nand implementation of the remedial plans.”19  The Consent Decree further requires DJJ to \n“provide plaintiff’s counsel and the Special Master with quarterly reports regarding progress \nmade, compliance with deadlines and actions taken in implementing this Decree.” 20   \nAs the Special Master has previously reported, DJJ assigned a project manager of the \nrequisite rank to manage its compliance effort by February 2006.  He was responsible for \nDJJ’s first quarterly report under the Consent Decree, which DJJ provided to plaintiff and the \nSpecial Master at the end of April 2006.  Unfortunately, he retired in early May 2006 and has \nyet to be replaced.  Defendant and DJJ’s top administrator, however, have assured plaintiff \nand the Special Master that the project manager will be replaced as quickly as possible, and \nthat the project management and compliance function will be fully staffed.21\nDJJ’s first quarterly report covers the period November 2004 through March 31, 2006 \nand discusses (1) the interim measures required by the Consent Decree and the January 31, \n2005 and November 30, 2006 stipulations concerning remedial efforts and the Safety and \nWelfare and Mental Health remedial plans; (2) the Wards with Disabilities Remedial Plan; (3) \nthe Health Care Services Medical Remedial Plan; and (4) the development and revision of the \nSafety and Welfare and Mental Health remedial plans.  Of the report’s four sections, only the \ndisability section is sufficiently comprehensive, factual and accurate to serve as a meaningful \nstatus report and to demonstrate that DJJ is able to track its compliance with its obligations \nand its progress in its reform effort in a subject matter area.  \n                                                 \n19 Consent Decree, ¶ 32. \n20 Id., ¶ 25. \n21 Statements by Secretary (A) California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation James Tilton and Chief \nDeputy Secretary Juvenile Justice Bernard Warner during monthly meeting of the parties and Special Master, \nMay 19, 2006.  The July 10 Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan (at p. 20) sets a deadline of October 1, 2006 for \nthe appointment of the Farrell Project Director. \n  7\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nB.  November 30 Stipulation  – Expert Interim Plans  \nBy the November 30 Stipulation, the parties agreed to ask jointly chosen experts to \nprepare interim plans to achieve immediate improvements in conditions and practices related \nto risk classification, restricted programs and lockdowns, use of force, disciplinary time-adds, \nand training of clinical staff to better manage self-destructive youth.22  The experts were only \na little more successful than DJJ had been in crafting interim plans for quick implementation \nto achieve immediate improvements.  The particulars in each area are discussed below.   \n  1.  Risk Classification \nThe first and subsequent drafts of the interim plan for custody classification, prepared \nby classification expert Christopher Baird, essentially reaffirmed the approach that DJJ had \nproposed in November 2004:  DJJ would identify all of the high risk youth living in \ndormitories and move them to more secure housing.  To free up single room beds, DJJ would \nmove low risk youth from rooms to dormitories.  DJJ took steps towards implementing its \nNovember 2004 interim risk classification plan, but then abandoned it without \ncontemporaneous explanation.23  By the second half of 2005, the new DJJ management \nexplained that the interim plan had been abandoned because it was not practical and it would \nnot have improved safety significantly.  With the support of Consent Decree expert Krisberg, \nplaintiff contended that DJJ unreasonably was resisting risk classification that would improve \nsafety.   \nWhen expert Baird proposed an interim classification plan that was essentially \nidentical to the one that the new DJJ management previously had rejected, DJJ reiterated the \n                                                 \n22 November 30 Stipulation, ¶¶ 6, 8-13. \n23 See, First Report of the Special Master, pp. 8-10. \n  8\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nfacts and conditions that had led it to abandon the November 2004 plan.  Specifically, DJJ \ncontended that there was a paucity of rooms occupied by nonviolent, lower risk youth outside \nof the special programs (mental health, sexual behavior treatment, etc.) and that youth could \nnot be moved immediately between the northern and southern facilities without exacerbating \ngang violence.   DJJ shared classification and disciplinary data and raised logistical issues.  \nWith the support of experts Baird and Krisberg, plaintiff maintained that DJJ’s objections \nwere without merit, though the experts did not specifically address DJJ’s logistical issues.  \nThe Special Master suggested that classification expert Baird revise the interim plan to \naddress the DJJ data and logistical issues and to detail the steps that DJJ could take to achieve \nthe prescribed goal.  This was not done.  As of May 19, 2005, the parties agreed that DJJ \nwould proceed with implementation of the central features of expert Baird’s custody \nclassification plan, unless and until DJJ could show that further implementation was \nlogistically impracticable.24\n  2.  Restricted Program And Lockdown \nIn early January 2006, the parties agreed that DJJ would implement the experts’ plan \nto restrict the use of the Inyo housing unit at the O.H. Close facility, and to modify practices \nand improve conditions there.25  Specifically, the plan provides that Inyo will be used to house \nonly (1) youth in need of “temporary interventions” by staff to de-escalate potentially \ndangerous situations, (2) youth awaiting transfer to other facilities or to court proceedings and  \n                                                 \n24  The Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan (July 10, 2006) provides that DJJ will work with expert Krisberg to \ndevelop the implementation schedule for custody classification.  Future monitoring of this issue will be under the \nSafety and Welfare Remedial Plan.   \n25  The interim plan is attached as Appendix B. \n  9\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\n(3) youth suspected of serious assaults on staff or on youth involving the use of a weapon.26  \nThe experts’ plan also provides that rooms adjacent to O.H. Close’s open dorm housing units \nmay be used for other kinds of youth who require temporary detention or separation from \ntheir peers.27  Finally, the plan requires that the youth housed on the Inyo unit be afforded the \nsame program treatment, privileges, property and state issued items as youth housed on other \nunits.28\nOne of the experts chosen by the parties to prepare the plan, Steve Cambra, was part \nof a two-person team that audited DJJ’s compliance.  The February and March 2006 progress \nreports detail the reasons for each Inyo placement and individual lengths of stay on the unit.  \nOnce the plan was implemented, the number of youth assigned to Inyo and their lengths stay \ndecreased significantly.  The experts found DJJ in substantial compliance with all \nrequirements of the Inyo plan.29  Consent Decree expert Krisberg will review compliance with \nthe plan in June 2006. \nAt the end of March 2006, the Safety and Welfare planning experts provided draft \nplans to revise DJJ policies concerning restricted programs30 and lockdown, in order to reduce \nthe extent and duration of the time that youth spend in relative idleness and isolation in lock-\nup units.  The parties agreed that the plans required further revisions.  The experts provided a \n                                                 \n26 Id., at pg. 2 \n27 Id., at pg. 1. \n28 Id., at pg. 5. \n29 See, Appendix C. \n30 “Restricted program” policies cover the Special Management Program (“SMP”) and Temporary Detention \n(“TD”) housing units where youth tend to be locked in cells for 21 or more hours per day.  See, First Report of \nSpecial Master, pp. 34-41. \n  10\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nrevision on May 7, 2006.  The parties have agreed to discuss and resolve any remaining \nconcerns by early June.31\n  3.  Use Of Force And Disciplinary Time-Adds \nAt the end of March 2006, the designated Safety and Welfare Planning experts \nprovided the parties with draft plans designed to measure and reduce the use of force, to limit \nthe use of restraint chairs and to modify policies and practices concerning disciplinary time-\nadds.  Both parties agreed that the draft plans for measuring and reducing the use of force and \nconcerning disciplinary time-adds needed to be revised.  DJJ accepted the draft plan for \nlimiting the use of restraint chairs; the plaintiff did not.  The experts agreed to provide revised \ndrafts, but prioritized activities related to finalizing the Safety and Welfare and Mental Health \nremedial plans.32   \n  4.  Plan For Clinicians Managing Self-Destructive Youth \nPursuant to paragraph 13 of the November 30 Stipulation, Consent Decree expert Dr. \nTrupin, in consultation with DJJ, was to develop an interim plan for enhancing the ability of \nDJJ clinical staff to manage youth with self-destructive behavior.  The plan was to be \nconsistent with DJJ’s legal restraints and it was to include a reasonable implementation \ntimetable.  DJJ was to implement the plan absent compelling reasons not to implement it. \nDr. Trupin recommended, as his proposed plan, that DJJ contract with a specific \nexpert psychologist trainer to provide training and supervision to all clinicians in the \n                                                 \n31 As of late July, the parties planned to revisit and resolve issues related to the interim plans for restricted \nprogram and lockdowns by early August. \n32 In July 2006, the parties agreed to cover the use of force and time-add issues in the Safety and Welfare and \nMental Health remedial plans.  The November 30 Stipulation separate “interim” plans will not be completed.  \n  11\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nmanagement of youth with self-destructive behavior at a cost of $75,000 to $100,000.33  DJJ \nreasonably objected that this proposal was not consistent with the legislative budget \nrestriction that required it to await completion of the legislatively mandated Chico State \nTraining Needs Assessment before it committed training funds for training required by Farrell \nremedial plans.  Further, DJJ could not responsibly commit to contract for training and \nsupervision of this scope without the context of a yet-to-be-developed integrated plan for \nclinician training and supervision.   \nIII.  SEX BEHAVIOR TREATMENT REMEDIAL PLAN \nThe sexual behavior treatment expert serving under the Consent Decree, Dr. Barbara \nSchwartz completed her first round of monitoring in November 2005.  Her November 30, \n2005 report is attached as Appendix D.34 Her findings, conclusions and recommendations are \nbased on site visits conducted October 20 through 26, 2005.  During those visits, she reviewed \ndocuments, met with DJJ’s Sexual Behavior Treatment Program administrators, clinicians and \nother care providers and observed the “residential” sexual behavior treatment programs at \nO.H. Close, N.A. Chaderjian, H.G. Stark, and Southern Reception Center facilities.35  She \nsubsequently attended a meeting in March 2006 of the Sex Behavior Treatment Program Task \n                                                 \n33 Correspondence from Dr. Henry Schmidt to Dr. Trupin, March 25 and 27, 2006, forwarded to the Special \nMaster. \n34  Dr. Schwartz’s report was the first report submitted by an expert serving under the Consent Decree.  The \nSpecial Master provided it to the parties but did not file it pending the parties’ agreement concerning the \nprocedure for filing experts reports.  The parties agreed in April 2006 that reports would be filed quarterly with \nthe Special Master’s quarterly reports, after the parties had an opportunity to review and respond to them.  Any \nresponses also will be filed.  \n35  See, Appendix. D, pp. 11-14. These four facilities are the only ones that provide “residential” treatment \nprograms. \n  12\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nForce.  Dr. Schwartz expects to complete a second round of monitoring in the summer of \n2006.36\nDJJ’s Sexual Behavior Treatment Task Force is comprised of a Program \nAdministrator, several clinicians who work in the “residential” programs and the expert \nconsultant retained by DJJ to help it implement the Sexual Behavior Treatment Remedial \nPlan.  While the task force has been diligently and skillfully trying to accomplish the projects \nset out in the remedial plan, it has been handicapped by DJJ’s failure to hire someone to fill \nthe Sexual Behavior Treatment Coordinator position.   \nDr. Schwartz noted the urgent need to secure a qualified coordinator in her November \n30, 2005 report.37  DJJ created and has advertised the position as a senior psychologist \nposition without attracting any applicants, apparently because the compensation is too low \n(less than the compensation of the DJJ psychologists who the coordinator is supposed to \nsupervise).38  DJJ reports that the California Department of Personnel Administration has \nrefused its requests to increase the compensation.39  Dr. Schwartz also recommends that the \nposition be open to other-than-psychologist sex behavior treatment specialists so as to expand \nthe pool of potentially qualified applicants.40  \nThe task force has completed one of the several treatment curricula required by the \nremedial plan.  Dr. Schwartz reports that the completed curriculum is very good.  She is \nconcerned, however, that DJJ may not be devoting sufficient resources to the development of \n                                                 \n36  Special Master’s email communications and telephone conversations with Barbara Schwartz, March 24, 26 \nand April 2006. \n37   See, Appendix D, p. 7. \n38  Letter Monica Anderson to Special Master, June 15, 2006. \n39 Statements of counsel to Special Master during meeting concerning draft of this report, June 16, 2006. \n40  See, Appendix D, p. 7. \n  13\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nthe remaining curricula, choosing instead to rely on DJJ clinicians who lack experience in \ncurriculum development and who have other full-time responsibilities.41\nSince November 2005, the Sexual Behavior Task Force also has been developing a \nPolicies and Procedures Manual with the goal of completing it by July 2006.42   Such a \nManual is, according to Dr. Schwartz, needed to make all staff aware of the legal and ethical \nissues affecting their work, particularly those involving confidentiality and informed \nconsent.43\nDr. Schwartz’s report contains detailed recommendations on the maintenance of \nstandardized and accessible treatment files.44  Adequate treatment requires standardized files \naccessible to all members of the treatment team.45  The Special Master has reviewed this issue \nwith knowledgeable DJJ staff and they acknowledge that, at present, the sex behavior \ntreatment notes are entered in four different files (paper and electronic), some of which cannot \nbe accessed by non-clinical members of the treatment team  (counselors, parole agents).46  \nDr. Schwartz was very impressed by the program staff (psychologists, parole agents \nand correctional counselors) who she observed working in the residential treatment programs.  \nThey were “professional, caring and competent” and generally knowledgeable about the areas \nfor which they were responsible.  She observed them skillfully using positive reinforcement \nand following the principles of Motivational Interviewing.  She observed comfortable, \nconstructive human interaction between staff and youth at each of the residential program \n                                                 \n41  Special Master’s email communications and telephone conversations with Barbara Schwartz, March 24, 26 \nand April 2006. \n42  See, Appendix D, p. 2. \n43  Ibid. \n44  See, Appendix D, p. 7. \n45  See, Appendix D, p. 7. \n46  Special Master’s meeting with DJJ staff and counsel concerning information requests, May 23, 2006. \n  14\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nhousing units.  She could not obtain documentation of the staff members’ qualifications and, \ntherefore, was not able to find DJJ in compliance with that aspect of the remedial plan’s \nstandards and criteria.47   \nDJJ has followed Dr. Schwartz’s recommendation48 that it adopt the normed and \nvalidated J-SOAP as one of the instruments to be used to assess sexual behavior treatment \nneeds of DJJ youth.49  The adoption of J-SOAP will require special training, which DJJ \ncannot implement until the Chico State Training Needs Assessment is completed.50  Other \nnecessary staff training has been deferred pending the completion of the Chico State Training \nNeeds Assessment.51\nIn addition to the residential programs, the Sexual Behavior Treatment Remedial Plan \nprovides for DJJ to implement an  “outpatient” program for youth with less severe sexual \nbehavior issues.  But, while the remedial plan requires that youth be placed in programs \naccording to their assessed needs, it does not reference sexual behavior treatment for youth \nwith co-morbid conditions who are currently being treated in DJJ’s mental health treatment \nunits. There has, therefore, been some confusion as to whether the youth who need (and may \nbe Board ordered to receive) sexual behavior treatment but who are not in one of the \nresidential programs are receiving such treatment. 52        \n                                                 \n47 See, Appendix D, p. 9. \n48  Id., p. 10. \n49 Email from Dr. Schwartz to the Special Master, March 26, 2006. \n50 Ibid. \n51 Ibid. \n52 On January 8, 2006, the Special Master interviewed youth at a Preston ITP whose clinicians had told them \nthat their sexual behavior treatment in the ITP might not count towards their Board requirements because it was \nnot part of the formal sexual behavior treatment program.   A DJJ administrator later confirmed that clinicians in \nmental health programs treated provided sexual behavior treatment to youth who required it, albeit, entirely \nindependently of the sexual behavior treatment program.  She said that the treatment would count as meeting the \nyouths’ Board requirements. \n  15\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nAt present, the clinicians providing sexual behavior treatment to youth in mental \nhealth treatment housing units have no connection with the developing sexual behavior \ntreatment program. “Outpatient” sexual behavior treatment has yet to be defined or designed.  \nFurther, consistent with the observations and recommendations of other experts, Dr. Schwartz \nnotes the need for institutional schedules for treatment and other program activities to ensure \nthat prescribed treatment activities are not supplanted, shortened or disrupted.53\nDr. Schwartz also found that many of the sexual behavior treatment clinicians, \ncounselors and parole agents are not aware of the aftercare programs available in the \ncommunity for paroled and discharged youth. Yet, as Dr. Schwartz and a number of the other \nexperts have noted, a program for institutional treatment that is not coordinated with the \navailable aftercare programs is of little or no value.54\nIV.  DISABILITY REMEDIAL PLAN \nThe Consent Decree expert in physical and programmatic access for youth with \ndisabilities, Logan Hopper, conducted compliance audits at all DJJ facilities between \nSeptember 2005 and April 2006.  His “Wards with Disabilities Program Remedial Plan \nAuditor’s Report” is attached as Appendix E.   The first two pages summarize his compliance \nfindings approximately one-year after DJJ filed the Wards with Disabilities Remedial Plan \n(“disabilities remedial plan”).  The body of the report provides specific facility-by-facility \nassessments for each item audited.   He provided the Special Master, and the Special Master \nprovided the parties, with the individual facility audits as they were completed.   \n                                                 \n53 See, Appendix D, pp. 8-9. \n54  See, Appendix D, p. 6, 10; email and telephone communications from Dr. Schwartz to the Special Master \nMay 2005, March and April 2006. \n  16\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nDJJ has made significant progress in the year since the disabilities remedial plan was \nfiled.55  A key achievement and factor in DJJ’s progress was its retention of department and \nfacility level disabilities program coordinators and, at six facilities, assistants to the \ncoordinators.56  With the leadership and management of a department coordinator, and of \nfacility coordinators, DJJ has been able to plan and track its progress as demonstrated by the \nWards with Disability Remedial Plan section of DJJ’s quarterly report for the first quarter of \n2006.57  Mr. Hopper reviewed the report and found it to be generally accurate and consistent \nwith his own report (with only a few minor discrepancies).58  He has made suggestions for \nimprovement of facility monthly reports for more complete compliance reporting.59\nAmong noncompliance issues, the most significant is that DJJ is falling far behind the \nplan’s June 2006 deadline for training all staff in disability sensitivity, awareness and \nharassment.  This training is to be prepared with the assistance of an outside disability \norganization or consultant, in consultation with Mr. Hopper as the Consent Decree expert.60  \nDJJ does not yet have a plan to get the necessary assistance and design and to give this \ntraining.  DJJ missed the December deadline for special higher-level training by outside \ntrainers for facility program coordinators.61  As in other subject matter areas, training has been \ndelayed pending completion of the Chico State Training Needs Assessment.   Aware of the \n                                                 \n55 Appendix E and email and telephone communications from Logan Hopper to the Special Master and Monitor \nBeltz, May 2006. \n56 Appendix E, p. 1. \n57 The WDP Remedial Plan section of DJJ’s quarterly report for the first quarter of 2006 is attached as Appendix \nF.  Its description of the coordinators’ activities shows how key they are to what DJJ has accomplished in the \narea of disability access. \n58 Email from Logan Hopper to the Special Master, May 2, 2006. \n59 Appendix E, p. 1. \n60  Wards With Disabilities Remedial Plan, pp. 56-57. \n61 Id. at 57. \n  17\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\ndeficiency, DJJ headquarters staff have provided training and supervision to facility \ncoordinators based on the requirements of the disabilities remedial plan.  Nonetheless, the \nrequired trainings that are being delayed, especially the system-wide sensitivity-awareness- \nharassment training, are key to successful and timely implementation of the disability \nremedial plan.62  \nThe disabilities plan requires coordination with special working groups and staff \nimplementing other remedial plans under the Consent Decree.63  The special working group to \nmake recommendations for improvements to IEP accommodations and parent participation \nhad been convened, but the work was not planned or begun in the other areas.64  \nDJJ has completed some projects removing architectural barriers ahead of the schedule \nset by the plan.65  This bodes well for the prospects for the successful and timely removal of \narchitectural barriers.   \nV.  EDUCATION REMEDIAL PLAN \nThe Consent Decree education experts, Dr. Thomas O’Rourke and Dr. Robert Gordon, \nconducted compliance audits at all DJJ facilities between September 2005 and April 2006.  \nTheir first Summary Education Program Report with two appendices is attached as Appendix \nG.66 The summary report displays compliance status for each facility, the audit criterion and \nrecommendations where action is required to remediate serious deficiencies.  If DJJ is to \nbegin to make adequate progress under the Education Services Remedial Plan (“education \n                                                 \n62  Email and telephone communications from Logan Hopper to the Special Master and Monitor Beltz, May \n2006. \n63 See, e.g., disabilities plan, p. 15, 26, 34 and 58.   \n64 Appendix E, p. 2. \n65 Appendix E, p.1. \n66 The experts provided the Special Master with and the Special Master provided the parties with the individual \nfacility audits as they were completed. \n  18\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nplan”), priority needs to be given to addressing these findings.  Their recommendations are \nnoted for each of the major sections of the education plan. \nDJJ has made significant progress under the education plan in the past year, most \nparticularly in that it has established competitive pay levels for teachers, expanded its efforts \nto recruit quality teachers and adopted a 220 day school schedule to be implemented in \nAugust 2006 as required by the plan.67  Continued attention must be give to hiring and \nretaining enough teachers to meet the educational needs of the entire student population.  \nUnfortunately, through April 2005, classes often were cancelled and schools did not offer all \nof the courses necessary to enable the students to make reasonable progress towards \ngraduation.68   \nDJJ will not be able to achieve compliance with the education plan without \ncooperation and collaboration between custody, treatment and education staff.  The plan \nrequires that there be a written cooperation agreement at each DJJ facility detailing how \ncustody, treatment and education management and staff work together to ensure that youth \nreceive all necessary services, including their full education day.69  As of yet, none of DJJ’s \nfacilities have such an agreement in place.70  As important, school principals do not have the \nlevel of autonomy from facility superintendents necessary for the principals to be able to \nmanage the education program to meet the needs of the youth population.71  \n                                                 \n67 See, Appendix G.  The 220-day school year was approved but was still pending contract negotiations in May \n2006.  The contract negotiations were since concluded.   \n68 See, Appendix G, Attachment A pp.1-2. \n69 Education Services Remedial Plan, Section III.D. \n70 See, Appendix G, Summary, p.6. \n71  Statements by Drs. O’Rourke and Gordon to Special Master May 30, 2006. \n  19\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\n  DJJ has not had a permanent Superintendent of Education since the education plan \nwas filed, and this is a problem.  It will take strong leadership to address all the obstacles that \nstand in the way of providing state mandated education to DJJ youth.  The Educational \nSuperintendent will have to be empowered by the DJJ Chief Deputy Secretary in order to be \nable to effectuate the changes that are necessary. \nVI.  CONCLUSION \n  The experts’ 2003 reports underlying the Consent Decree documented harmful \nconditions for youth that resulted from decades of California’s attritting resources from \ntreatment and rehabilitation and from increasingly punitive attitudes towards prisoners, \nwhether juvenile or adult.  California’s juvenile correctional facilities, initially intended for \nthe reformation of youth, were transformed into adultified prisons characterized by high levels \nof youth violence and staff use of chemical agents, punitive and restrictive conditions and a \npaucity of treatment and constructive activities for youth. \nNational experts jointly selected by the parties have cogently explained how difficult \nand lengthy an undertaking it will be to reform DJJ.   \nNo one should underestimate the difficulty of implementing such \nsweeping reform in a system as troubled as this. The task is do-able, but it will \ntake long-term commitment and cooperation between parties who don’t always \nagree. Players will change. Mistakes will be made. The process will take years. \nThe end result, however, will be worth it. Lives will be changed and futures \nrestored. Communities will be safer and prisons less full.72\n \nDJJ’s first tasks are to build the capacity for change and to regain control of its \nfacilities and greatly reduce the violence.73  In the eighteen months since the Consent Decree \nin this case was entered, DJJ has taken significant steps towards building the capacity and \n                                                 \n72 Murray, et al., Safety and Welfare Plan:  Implementing Reform in California (March 31, 2006), p. 36. \n73 Id. at pp. 36-40; Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan, p. 8, 23. \n  20\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\nconditions for the reform that is so necessary.  DJJ has filled a number of key leadership and \nmanagement positions with people who appear to have the skills and abilities to lead and \nmanage the reform.  It has organized and supported a high-level reform planning team that \nhas led the successful effort to develop credible reform plans.  That effort has involved \nconducting extensive analysis of existing resources and predicting needed resources; planning \nfor the immediate, four-year and long-term time frames; developing and supporting budget \nproposals resulting in a substantial increase in DJJ’s budget; and developing duty statements \nand justifications for contracts.  DJJ has engaged outside experts to assist in the development \nof the reform plans, and it has begun to engage state and local stakeholders in the planning \nprocess.   Other accomplishments are noted in this report.   \nIt is now incumbent on DJJ to begin to change practices and conditions in substantial \nways at the facility level.  This will require strong leadership at all levels and in all \noperational areas.  Leaders will have to make and enforce decisions that cause discomfort.  \nThey will have to build an infrastructure capable of managing all aspects of operations and \nimplementing and enforcing central policy at the facility level.   They will have to ensure that \ndepartments and individuals responsible for treatment and rehabilitation services have the \nautonomy and support necessary to develop and deliver those services.  They will have to \nfoster collaboration between management and labor and among staff of different disciplines to \ndeliver treatment and rehabilitative services to youth.  They will have to begin to transform \nthe way that staff and youth relate by training to enhance staff skills for teaching youth and \nmanaging their behavior.  Institutional reform is slow, and initiating reform is the most \n  21\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 \n\ndifficult step.   DJJ now has the opportunity to begin to make real change and improve \nconditions for the youth it is charged to rehabilitate and it must not delay. \n \nDated:  June, 2006        ___________________________ \n                Donna Brorby \n                Special Master \n \n  22\nSecond Special Master’s Report \nJune 2006 ",

INTRODUCTION \nThe Disabilities Section of the Consent Decree Remediation  Plan  is  in  response to concerns \nidentified  by  the  Prison  Law  Office  (PLO)  and  areas  identified  by  the  findings  and \nrecommendations of disability experts Peter M. Robertson and  Logan Hopper in their reports \nprepared in January 2004 and January 2005 respectively, regarding the following areas: \n•  Accommodations for Wards With Disabilities \n•  Testing for Cognitive and Learning Disabilities \n•  Access for Wards With Disabilities to Programs, Services and Activities \n•  Removal of Architectural Barriers at  CY A Facilities, Camps and  Institutions \nHousing Wards with Disabilities who May Be Impacted by These Barriers \n•  Disability Related Grievances \n•  Wards with Disabilities Program Coordinators \n•  Policies  and  Procedures  on  Access to  Services,  Programs  and  Activities  for \nWards with Disabilities \n•  Protection for Wards with Disabilities from Harassment and Abuse Related to \nor Resulting from Their Disability or Perceived Disability \n•  Adequacy of Education for Wards with Disabilities \n•  Adequacy of Efforts to Integrate Wards with Disabilities \n•  Disability Awareness Training \nThe  Wards  with  Disabilitics  Program  (hereinafter  WDP)  Remedial  Plan  responds  to  thc \ndejlcieneies cited in the experts' reports and contains a detailed description of those things that \nthe California Youth Authority (CY A or Department) will be required to do in order to come into \ncompliance with state and federal law.  The Department anticipates coming into compliance with \nfederal law, as well as addressing the concerns of the PLO lawsuit. \nA.  CY A Expert Findings/Statement of the Problem \nOriginally,  the  CY A  retained  the  expert  services  of  Peter  M.  Robertson  in  the  field  of \naccessibility management.  Mr. Robertson assessed the extent that the CY A policies, programs, \nservices,  activities,  and  the  facilities  where  they  are  offered,  accommodated  wards  with \ndisahilities. \nMr.  Robertson's  report  noted  that  CY A  had  not  adopted  system-wide  program  policies and \nprocedures responsive to  the implementation  of the  Americans with  Disabilities Act  (ADA), \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 and other federal or state laws regUlating disability nondiscrimination \nand accessibility.  The report focused heavily on physical access. but failed to comprehensively \naddress ward access to programs and services.  As a result, CYA contracted with Logan Hopper \nto  provide  expert  services  in  these  areas.  Mr.  Hopper  visited  all  CY A  facilities  between \nSeptemher and  December 2004.  His  report  of findings  was  prepared  in  January  2005  and \nspeci tlcally focused on access to programs and services for wards with disabilities in the C'{ A. \nDisabilities Program Remedial Plall  Page J of 58 \n.\\fay 31, l005 \n\nThe original accessibility evaluation revealed a significant number of conditions on a statewide \nbasis that may have the effect of limiting access to and opportunities for participation in CY A \nprograms,  services,  and  activities  available  to  wards  with  disabilities,  as  compared  to  those \navailable  to  wards  without  disabilities.  The  experts  noted  that  the  Department's  current \noperations  and existing conditions  limited qualified  wards'  access  to  programs,  services  and \nactivities, and failed to adequately accommodate the needs of wards with disabilities. \nThere is little standardization of practices and procedures regarding accommodations for wards \nwith  disabilities  in  CYA    facilities.  As  with  other operational  areas,  funding  for  disability \nservices  has  been  inadequate  to  bring  the  CYA    into  compliance  with  federal  laws  and \nregulations. \nAt nearly every institution toured, new construction and/or what appeared to be recent alterations \nto existing facilities, was done with what appears to be less than the required attention to details \nspecified in state and federal  standards for accessible design.  Based on  observations of new \nconstmction at  the  institutions toured,  additional  pre and  post  construction  accessibility was \nrecommended.  Training about accessible design and provision of on-site resources to individual \ninstitution staff and outside contractors performing minor alterations was also indicated. \nB.  Policy Goals \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.), section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.A. § 794), the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civil Code § \n51, et seq.), and Government Code section 11135, provide comprehensive civil rights protections \nto qualified individuals with disabilities in the area of state government services.  The California \nYouth Authority (CY A) is charged to ensure that no qualified individual with a disability shall, \nby reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of, the \nservices, programs, or activities of the Department, or be subjected to  discrimination by any \nDepalimental  representative.  Therefore,  it  is the policy of the  Department that no qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in, \nor  be  denied  the  benefits  ot;  the  services, programs,  or  activities  of the  Department,  or be \nsubjected to discrimination by any Departmental representative. \nThe Dcpartment recognizes that wards with disabilities require different levels of care and a wide \nrange oftreatment options.  The goals of the Disabilities Program policy are I) assure equality of \nopportunity and full participation in all Departmental sen'ices, programs, or activities; 2) assure \nthe  elimination  of discrimination  against  individuals with  disabilities;  and  3)  provide  clear, \nstrong,  consistcnt,  enforceable  standards  addressing  discrimination  against  individuals  with \ndisabilities.  The Department shall ensure that disabled wards have access equal to non-disabled \nwards in all levels of care within the youth correctional system. \nAll wards under the jurisdiction of the CY A shall be given equal access to all programs, services \nand activities offered by the Department.  Programs, sen·iees. and activities shall be offered in \nthe least restrictive environment, with or without accommodations. \nThe CYA ensures that the constitutional rights of wards arc met. \nDisqbilities Program Remedial Plan  Page 2 oI58 \nMay 3], 2005 \n\nC.  Standards \nThe CY A shall ensure that disabled wards have access equal to non-disabled wards in all levels \nof care within the youth corrcctional system. \nThe CY A shall ensure that the constitutional rights of wards are met. \nThe CYA   shall ensure equal access to education, training, and treatment services in the least \nrestrictive environment for all wards. \nThe CY A shall ensure effective access to  programs,  servlces,  and  activities,  for wards with \ndisabilities by: \n•  Making reasonable modifications in policies, practices, procedures, and programs, \nunless it is demonstrated that modifications would fundamentally alter the nature \nof programs, services, and activities. \n•  Ensuring  that  programs,  services,  and  activities  are  provided  in  an  integrated \nsetting, unless separate or different measures arc necessary for equal opp011unity. \n•  Not  excluding  wards  with  disabilities  from  programs,  services,  and  activities \nbecause of architectural or programmatic barriers. \n•  Providing  wards  with  disabilities  assistive  devices  and/or  services  or  other \naccommodations. \nThe Disabilities Program  Remedial  Plan  shall  be  responsive  to  the  deficiencies cited  in  the \nexperts' reports and will contain a detailed description of those things that CY A will be required \n. to do in order to come into compliance with state and federal law.  The Depm1ment anticipates \ncoming into compliance with federal  law,  as well as  addressing the concerns of the PLO, by \nproviding  sufficient  positions  and  resources  to  accommodate  the  needs  of all  wards  with \ndisabilities at all facilities in areas of physical accessibility, programs, services and activities. \nAs  part  of the  clinic  screening  and  assessment  process,  all  wards  shall  be  screened  at  the \nrcception centers, and as indicated throughout their stay in the Department, to determine whether \nthey have a developmental disability, which may make them eligible under criteria set forth in \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and/or may make them eligible to receive services \nJi\"om  a Regional Center.  Developmental disabilities include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, \nepilepsy, autism, or other neurological disabilities, which result in symptoms similar to mental \nretardation. \nII.

Effective Communication \nReasonable accommodation shall be afforded wards with disabilities to ensure equally effective \ncommunication with staff, other wards, and the pUblic.  Assistive devices that are reasonable, \neffective, and appropriate to the needs of a ward shall be provided when simple written or oral \ncommunication is not effective. Such assistive devices may include interpreters, readers, taped \ntexts,  canes,  crutches,  wheelchairs,  hearing  aids,  corrective  lcnses,  tele-typewriters  (TTY's), \ntelecommunication  deviccs  for  dcaf persons  (TDD's),  assistive  listening headsets,  television \ncaptioning and decoders, Braille materials, video text displays, and large print materials. \nBecause of the critical importance of communication involving due process or health care, the \nstandard for equally effective communication is higher when these interests are involved.  The \nDepartment shall ensure that staff provides effective communication under all circumstances, but \nthe  degree  of accommodation  that  is  required  shall  be  determined  on  a  case-by-case basis. \nAlthough in  some circumstances a notepad and  written materials may be sufficient to permit \neffective communication, in  other circumstances they may not be sufficient.  For example, a \nqualified interpreter may be necessary when the information being communicated is complex, or \nis exchanged for a lengthy period of time.  Generally, factors to be considered in detennining \nwhether an  interpreter is required  include the context in  which the communication is taking \nplace, the numher ofpeop1c involved and the importance of the communication. \nWays to detcmline whether a ward with a disability has understood a communication include, \nbut are not limited to:  1) a deaf or hard of hearing ward repeating back the substance of the \ncommunication through a sign language interpreter, 2) a deaf or hard of hearing ward indicating \na substantive response  via written  notes,  or 3)  a deaf or hard  of hearing ward  indicating  a \nsubstantive response via sign language througll an interpreter. \n1.  Sign Language Interpreters \nQualified  sign  language  interpreters  shall  be  provided  for  all  due  process \nfunctions and  medical consultations \\vhen sign language is the primary means \nfor effective communication, except when  a ward is over the age of 18  years \nand  \\vaives  the  assistance  of an  interpreter,  when  attempts  to  obtain  an \ninterpreter are  not  successful  after  reasonable  and  timely attempts,  or when \ndelay would pose a safety or security risk. \nDi.\\ubiliries Program Rt!J1lt!dial Plall  Page 11 of 58 \nMay 31,2005 \n\nQualified  interpreter\"  or  \"qualified  sign  language  interpreter\"  means  an \ninterpreter who is able to interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially both \nreceptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. \nAt  a  minimum,  CY A  will  require  that  its'  interpreters  be persons  adept  at \nAmerican Sign  Language (ASL)and have certification qualifications from  the \nRegistry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) and/or the National Association for \nthe Deaf (NAD), or their equivalents, which are current and up to date. \nQualified sign language interpreters shall be made available for all other special \nprograms,  including  but  not  limited  to  religious  services,  meetings  and \norientations.  Interpreters for education services shall be provided as described \nin a ward's IEP. \nIn  the  event  a  qualified  sign  language  interpreter  is  not  available  after \nreasonable and timely attempts were made to secure one, or is waived by a ward \nwho is an adult, staff shall employ the most effective form of communication \navailable.  Staff shall use both receptive and expressive means to communicate. \nEffective fomls of communication might include, but are not limited to, written \nnotes,  staff  interpreters  and  specialized  vocabulary.  Staff  shall  interpret \ncommunication accurately and impartially. \nThe  types  of  medical  consultations  in  which  a  qualified  slgn  language \ninterpreter shall be provided include, but are not limited to: \n1)  determining a medical history; \n2)  obtaining a description of an ailment or injury; \n3)  providing patient rights; \n4)  obtaining infomled consent: \n5)  obtaining penllission to treat; \n6)  providing a prognosis or diagnosis; \n7)  explaining procedures. tests, or treatment; \n8)  expJaining the use of prescribed medications including dosage, \nside effects. or food interactions; \n9)  giving discharge instructions: and \n10 ) providing mental health evaluations. \nVideoconfercncing  is  an  appropriate  and  acceptable  means  of  providing \nqualified  sign  language  interpretive  services,  and  may  be  employed  when \navailable.  The ability of a ward to lip-read shall not be the sole source used by \nstaff  for  effective  communication  during  medical  consultations  or  when \nensuring the due process rights of wards. \nDisabilities Program Remedial Plan  Page 12 of 58 \nMay 31,2005 \n\nStaff who  are  able to  interpret  effectively,  accurately,  and  impartially, both \nreceptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary may \nbe utilized as an interpreter, in the event a qualified sign language interpreter is \nnot reasonably available, or is waived by the ward. \nThe Department shall  ensure contracts or service agreements are  established \nwith a local sign interpretcr servicc organization in order to provide interpretive \nservices for deaf or hard of hearing wards during medical consultations and due \nprocess functions. \nB.  Reasonable Accommodation \nThe Department shall provide reasonable accommodations or modifications for known physical \nand mental  disabilitics  of qualified  wards.  Accommodations shall be made to  afford  equal \naccess to the court, to legal representation, and to health care services for wards with disabilities. \nExamples of reasonable accommodations include, but are not limited to: \n1)  staff assistants \n2)  sign language interpreters \n3)  modification of work or program schedules \n4)  grab-bars \n5)  magnifiers \n6)  electronic readers \n7)  sound ampli fication devices \nTo assist in accommodating cqual access for a ward to the court, the Department shall provide a \nletter to the couli identifying the nature and severity of the disability and any limitations of a \nward.  This  letter  shall  also  include  a  brief description  of the  request  of the  ward  for  an \naccommodation by the court. \nC.  Denial Of Reasonable Accommodations \nThe Superintendent/Chief Medical Officer (CMO)!Principal shall make a recommendation to the \nDirector, or designee, when he or she detemlines that an accommodation should be denied. \nReasonable accommodations may only be denied for the following reasons: \n1.  Direct Threat to the Health or Safety of Others \nThe CYA is not required to permit a ward with disabilities to participate in or \nbenefit  from  the  goods,  services,  facilities,  privileges,  advantages  and \naccommodations if that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of \nothers.  A direct threat is a significant risk to the health or safety of others that \ncannot be eliminated by modification of policies. practices, or procedures. or by \nthe provision of auxiliarv aids or sen·iccs. \nThe detemlination that a ward with disabilities poses a direct threat to the health \nor safety of others may not be based on generalizations or stereotypes about the \neffects of a particular disabi lity. \nDisabilities Program Remedial Plall  Page 13 of 58 \nMay 31, 21J1J5 \n\nThc deternlination must be based upon an individualized assessment based upon \nreasonable judgment that  relics  on current medical  evidence or best  available \nobjective evidence to determine: \na)  the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; \nb)  the probability that the potential injury may actually occur; and \nc)  whether reasonablc modi fications of policies, practices or procedures \nwill mitigate the risk. \n2.  Undue Burden \nAn  accommodation may be considered an  undue burden and  denied when the \naccommodation would cause a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, \nprogram, or activity, or result in undue financial and administrative burdens. \n3.  Equally Effective Means \nA request for a specific accommodation may be denied if equally effective access \nto a program, service, or activity may be afforded through an alternative method \nthat  is  less  costly or intrusive.  Alternative methods may be used  to  provide \nrcasonable access in lieu of modifications requested by the ward as long as those \nmethods are equally effective. \nThe CMO,  in  consultation  with  medical,  mental health  and/or education  staff, \nshall  make  a  recommendation  to  the  Deputy  Director  of  Health  Care \nServices/Deputy Director of Education Services when an accommodation shall be \ndenied based on an alternative means for accessing a program, service, or activity. \nAll denials of specific requests sball be in writing. \nV.  ASSISTIVE DEVICES \nA.  Prescription and Approval \nIn conjunction with the Health Care Transition Team, Medical Experts and Disabilities Expert, \n(l) prepare an \"action plan\" for wards with mobility or other physical impairnlcnts to integrate \nwith the general population as  soon as medical issues are resolved, including deternlining the \nmost physically  accessible locations available  and making the barrier removal improvements \nrequired on  a timely basis, and (2) revise Temporary Departmental Order #03-12 to provide for \nthe evaluation of close vision necessary for reading and completing schoolwork or other required \nwritten activities and to procure  suitable glasses. contact lenses,  or other aids  for the ward's \nconstant use. \nDisabilities Program Remedial Plall  Page 14 of 58 \nMay 31, 200S \n\nAlso, in  conjunction with  the Health Care Transition Team,  the Mental Health and Medical \nExperts, and Disabilities Expert, ensure systems are in place to monitor the use of psychotropic \nprescriptions  and  medications  including  SSRI's  for  wards  under  the  age  of  20.

Custody  staff shall  approve  all  assistive  devices,  including  those \nbelonging to the ward prior to entry into the youth correctional system, for conformance with \ndepartment safety and security standards. \nThe CMO shall be immediately consulted when custody staff, upon inspection of an assistive \ndevice,  determines  that  a  legitimate  safety  or  security  risk  exists  and  shall  determine  the \nappropriate accommodation for the ward in  lieu  of the  assistivc  device  that poses  a security \nthreat to the safe operation of the facility. \nAlternative accommodations may  include  modifying the  appliance  or substituting a different \nappliance at State expense. \n1.  Possession of Assistive Devices \nAssistive devices shall be documented as property of the ward and appropriately \nidentified in accordance with department and facility policies and shall not be \nincluded in the volume limit for personal property. \nWards shall not be deprived of an assistivc device that was in their possession \nupon  entry into  the  youth  correctional  system  or that  was properly obtained \nwhile in department custody.  Assistive devices shall be retained and maintained \nby wards upon release to parole. \n2.  Purchase of Assistive Devices \nPrescribed assistive devices can be purchased by the ward through a vendor of \nthe ward's choosing or  by  the  Department.  The CMO  or the  Chief Dental \nOfficer shall approve the purchase of all assistive devices.  Licensed health care \nstaff shall ensure that all  assistive devices received  are  in  compliance with a \nphysician's order. \nThe procedure to verify compliance with a physician's order shall not cause a \ndelay in the delivery of prescribed assistive device.  Should a delay occur in thc \ndelivery of an assistive device, health care staff shall document the nature of the \ndelay and communicate the reason for delay to the ward and the assigned YCc. \nDisabilities Program Remedial Plall  Page 15 of 58 \nJJay 31, 20115 \n\n3.  Maintenance and Repair of Assistive Devices \nThe Department and the ward have a joint responsibility to maintain all assistive \ndevices in good repair and operation.  The ward shall use approved Department \nprocedures for notifying health care staff when an assistivc device is in need of \nrepair or replacement.  Upon notification of the need of repair or replacement, \nhealth care staff shall evaluate the condition of the assistive device.  Once the \nneed  for  repair  or  replacement  is  verified,  the  ward  shall  be  issued  an \nappropriate assistive device or an  accommodation.  The batteries for hearing \naids and other assistive devices shall be replaced immediately upon request. \nThe  ward  shall  be  financially  responsible  for  intentional  damage,  or  for \nresulting repair and  replacement of assistive devices and  parts,  and shall  be \ncharged the cost thereof in accordance with Department Disciplinary Decision \nMaking System (DDMS) dispositions. \n4.

Collecting an  assistivc device as evidence \nof a crime can only occur when supported by documented evidence.  No ward \nwill bc deprived of an assistivc device because of the acts of another ward. \nIf  a direct and immediate threat to safety and security ex ists, custody staff can \nimmediately take away an assistive device.

PROGRAM  FOR  WARDS  WITH  DEVELOPMENTAL  DISABILITIES  OVERVIEW, \nPHILOSOPHY AND PROGRAM POLICY \nIn consultation with the disabilities expert, the CY A will conduct a study regarding the need for \na  residential  program  for  wards  with  certain  developmental  disabilities.  The  study  will \ncommence within 6 months from the date that the Wards with Disabilities Program Remedial \nPlan  is  filed  with  the  court. Based on  the results of the  study, if applicable,  the  CY A shall \ndevelop and implement a plan to respond to the needs identified in the study.  The plan shall \ninclude procedures to ensure that no outward signs of identification or labeling will be posted for \nwards involved in this program. \nA.  Program Objectives \nEach  ward  who  has  becn  determined  to  have  a developmental  disability,  or in  need  of the \nserviccs  provided,  shall  be  placed  in  the  least  restrictive  environment  available,  while \nconcurrently  meeting  the  treatment  requirements  necessary  to  successfully  complete  their \nIdentified Treatment Issues (IT I)  and prepare for parole.  A high functioning developmentally \ndisabled ward could be placed in the General Population Outpatient (GPOP) Level  of Care if \nhis/her adaptive skills are advanced and he/she can maintain positive progress towards meeting \nhis/her IT!.  If progress is limited by his/her disability, or if his/her disability prohibits placement \nin the GPOP, wards who are developmentally disabled will be placed in a specialized program. \nThe program designated to provide developmental disability services to eligible wards shall do \nso via individualized treatment and educational programs, activities and services as prescribed by \nthe Individual Change Plan OCP) developed by their Interdisciplinary Treatment Team (IDTT) at \ncase conferences. \nB.  Population to be Served \nServices will be provided to all wards identified as being developmentally disabled or who have \nbeen detennined to need supportive services similar to wards with developmental disabilities, \ninespective of age of onset. \nC.  General Treatment Criteria \nWards that demonstrate a deficit in their level of adaptive functioning, but who do not meet the \nthree  part  eligibility criteria,  will  receive supportive  services.  Wards  that  are  vulnerable to \nvictimization  from  other wards based on their cognitive or adaptive functioning deficits will \nreceive supportive services. \nD.  Location of Programs \nWards  that  have  been  identified  as  being  developmentally  disahled,  or  as  requiring  these \nservices,  shall  be  placed  in  a  designated  GPOP,  or  a  specialized  program,  based  on  their \nindividual level of care needs, level of adaptive functioning, vulnerahility, and IT!. \nDisabilitit's Program Remedial Plall  Page 26 a/58 \nMay 31,2005 \n\nE.  Admission to Program \nI.  Screening Process \nAt all Youth Authority reception centers and clinics, all wards shall be screened \nfor the presence of a developmental disability. \nFor a diagnosis of developmental disability a ward must fully meet the three-part \neligibility requirement: \n1.  the ward has a full scale l.Q. of 69 or lower; \n2.  there are  deficits  in  adaptive  functioning,  including independent \nliving skills; and \n3.  the onset ofthe disability occurred prior to the age of 18. \nIn special cases, based on individual need, other conditions may allow eligibility \ninto the program for wards with developmental disabilities. \nThe screening process shall include an instrument designed to measure a ward's \noverall intelligence quotient. The cognitive skills will be tested utilizing either the \nKaufman  Brief Intelligence Test (a cognitive screening tool  used  to  provide a \nrapid estimate of cognitive functioning) or if the ward's English skills are limited, \nthe  TONI-Third  Edition  (a standardized, language-free, problem solving-based \ntest of cognitive ability), or alternative tests to be determined.  If a ward scores in \nthe borderline range of intellectual functioning or lower, he/she shall be referred \nto a clinical psychologist for further testing and evaluation. \nAs  part  of the  screening  process,  the  ward's  referral  documents  shall  be \nthoroughly reviewed  by the  rcccption  center and  clinic mental  health  staff to \ndetennine if the ward: \nI.  has  previously  been  identified  as  having  a  developmental \ndisability; \n2.  is eligible for special education services by being diagnosed as \nhaving a developmental disability; or \n3.  has  been  identified  by  a  Regional  Center  as  having  a \ndevelopmental disability. \nIn instances where a ward has not been identified during the clinic process, and \ninstitutional staff identify a need for screening, a mental health referral shall be \ncompleted by the case manager and the same process utilized for wards during the \nclinic process shall be followed by the designated clinical psychologist. \nAs mandated by state Jaw, designated educational specialists shall complete the \nassessment of wards who have active or inactive Individualized Education Plans \n(lEP) or who  demonstrate a need  for  further  evaluation during  the  educational \nassessment process. \nDisabilirie,\\' Program Remedial PlaJl  PaU., t! 27 O\"F  58 \nJla)\" 31,2005 \n\n2.  Evaluation Process \nThe assigned  clinical psychologist shall  thoroughly review the ward's Unified \nHealth Record (UHR), field file, education file; conduct a clinical interview with \nthe ward; and administer an age-appropriate, standardized, full scale intelligence \ntest.  The psychologist shall apply the three part eligibility criteria, and if the ward \nmeets the criteria, the ward will be eligible for developmental disability services. \nThe ward shall also be refcrred to the appropriate Regional Center (servicing the \nward's county of commitment) to determine whether the ward may be eligible for \nservices either while detained or on parole. \n3.  Placement Process \nWards  who  have been  identified  as  meeting the  eligibility requirements  for \nplacement  in  programs  providing  developmental  disability  services  shall  be \nplaced as follows: \nAfter completing the screening and evaluation process, a clinical psychologist \ndocuments the results in the ward's UHR and in the Ward rnfomlation Network \n(WIN)  system.  The  lEP team members,  after completing the screening and \nevaluation process, determine whether the ward is eligible for special education \nservices based on the presence of a developmental disability. \nThe ward's assigned IDTT, via the Case Conference process, shall review the \nevaluation  results,  decide  the  ward's  current  level  of care,  and  contact  the \nHealth Care Services Mental Health Administrator to arrange placement of the \nward in the designated GPOP or specialized program. \n4.  General Treatment Services \nOnce a ward has been identified as having a developmental disability and/or \nrequiring services for other reasons, he/she will have an rcp developed by their \nassigned IDTT, \nAreas and topics to be considered in the lCP include: \n•  Prompting \n•  Identifying triggers and cues \n•  Independent living skills \n•  Reinforcement \n•  Splinter skills \n•  Reinforcers \n•  Infonmllion processing \nThe IC?  written in behavioral terms that arc quantifiable and can be measured, \nshall include a behavioral analysis of the \\\\'ard's adaptive skills, the goals and \nobjectives  to  be  targeted  and  specifIC  skills  to  be  taught.  When  necessary, \nprompts may be given by any staff interacting with the ward, to assist him or \nher in acilic\\ing the objectives and goals, \nDisabilitil!.\\\" Program Remedial Plall  PIIge 28 of 58 \nMay 31,2005 \n\nDaily, weekly, and monthly data collection of the forms designed to tabulate \nprogress in the above areas will be completed and maintained to track progress \nand refine the ward's ICP. \n5.  Staffing and Case Management \nDevelopmental  disability services will  be  provided within the context of the \ndesignated GPOP or specialized program.  A clinical psychologist, institutional \nP A/Casework  Specialist  and  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  (YCC)  shall \nprovide  services to  wards with developmental disabilities. In  addition to the \ntraining provided to all staff, staff assigned to specialized programs will receive \nspecialized  training  on  working  with  wards  with  development  disabilities. \nTraining shall be appropriate to the staff role, such as continuing education for \nclinical staff, attendance at professional conferences, seminars, etc. \nThe  psychologist,  in  collaboration  with  the  IDTT,  will  develop  the  goals, \nobjectives  and  intervention  plan(s).  The  YCC  assigned  to  a  ward  with \ndisabilities  will  document the ward's progress  in  meeting hislher goals  and \nobjectives. If progress is not being made the team will meet to modify the plans \nto improve ward's treatment progress and goal attainment. \nThe YCC will  implement the ward's modified plans and document progress. \nThe institutional PA /Casework Specialist will collect and tabulate the results \nand chart overall progress.  The IDTT will monitor, modify and/or change the \nobjectives and goals based on the accomplishments of the ward. \nF.  Case Review and Discharge Process \n1.

The Department is in the process of segregating \nthe projects into three categories.  The first category will be comprised of projects that can be \n\"fixed\" in  a short period of time with a minimum of cost.  The second category will contain \nprojects, which will require substantial funding.  The third category will contain projects, which \nare not required for ward programmatic access and are not a part of this plan. \nBy July  15, 2005, the CYA shall  provide the Disability Expert and plaintiff's counsel with a \ncomprehensive list identifying each project as either category one, two or three and prioritizing \nthe two project categories to be complete.  This list shall also contain projects in category three, \nwhich arc not required which are not required for ward programmatic access and arc not a part of \nthis plan. \nDi.',;ubilitics Program Remedial PlalI  Page 55 of 58 \nMay 31, lOOS \n\nThe list shall be subject to final  approval  and revision by the Disability Expert and plaintiffs \ncounsel. The CY A agrees to file the final list, upon approval by all parties and the Disabilities \nExpert, by August IS, 2005 as Appendix C to this plan.  Construction of the first category of \nprojects shall be completed  by September 30, 2006,  and the second category of projects by \nSeptember 30,2008. \nThe  Department  will  provide  the  CY A  Remedial  Plan  Coordinator with  bi-annual  progress \nreports indicating the projects from each list that have been completed, beginning in March 30, \n2006.  The Remedial Plan Coordinator will forward these reports to the plaintiff. \nAs recommended in the Disability Expert's Report, the CY A will also identify improvements \nnecessary to provide programmatic access to  1) Sanitation and Hygiene, 2) Religious Services, \n3) Emergency Services and Plans, and 4) Food Service.  To the extent that these barriers are not \nimmediately remediated, in consultation with the Disability Expert and based on the findings and \nrecommendations of the Disability Expert's Report (pages 73, 74,  76 and 78), the CY A shall \nimmediately implement interim measures to ensure that wards with disabilities have access to \nnecessary programs and services. \nEmergency Alaml Svstem \nWhen new fire  alann  systems are installed as part of the Department's major capital outlay \nproject, flashing lights will be installed with all fire alann systems in order to meet federal and \nstate disability standards. \nB.  Critel'ia and Standards \nThe CY A commits to use the Minimum Standards for Local Juvenile Facilities, Title 24 Part 1, \nSection  13-201  and  Part  2,  Section  460A  as  the  basis  for  decision-making relative  to  any \nremediation(s) requiring modification orthe physical plant. \nThe  Department  shall  maintain  all  existing  facilities,  camps,  offices  and  any  corresponding \noutdoor areas, including features such as ramps, walkways and parking lots, to ensure physical \naccess to programs, services and activities. \nXV.

Juvenile wards of the state are confmed within the California Y oulli \n3  Authority (CYA) for rehabilitation, training and treatment.  (Weir. & lnst. Code § 1700.) \n4  The CYA's illegal and inhmnane conditions violate this statutory m:mdate and numerous \n5  other legal requirements.  Rehabilitation is impossible when the classroom is a cage and \n6  wards live in constant fear of physical and sexual violence from CYA   staff and other \n7  wards.  Training is not possible while CYA programs are not available and CYA   staff are \n8  inadequate in both nmnbers and experience.  Treatment is impossible while forced \nI \n9  administration of psychotropic medication is used as a tool to control behavior, and when \n10  psychologists and psychiatrists are not available to the vast majority of wards.  The \n11  severe, unconstitutional and illegal problems conditions in the CYA are not new and they \n12 I  are not a secret \n13  2.  This taxpayer action is brought by Margaret Farrell to compel defendant \nI \n14  Jerry Harper, Director of the CYA  , to stop using taxpayer funds to further the illegal \n15  conditions that exist in the CY A.  Plaintiff seeks a declaration that defendant Harper has \n16  spent taxpayer funds Oli illegal policies, practices, and procedures, and seeks an \n17  injlllction requiring defendant to either stop accepting wards for whom he does not have \nI \n18  adequate facilities to provide care pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 736, \nI \n19  or refrain from spending taxpayer funds to further the illegal actions set forth below. \n20  JURISDICTION \n21  3.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief on behalf of Plaintiff \n22  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 525 and 526. \n23  4.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratOly relief on behalf of Plaintiff \n24  . pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. \nI \n25  PARTIES \nI \n26  A  Plaintiff \n27  5.  Plaintiff Margaret Farrell is a citizen of Califomia and a resident of Reseda \n28  . in Los Angeles County.  She has paid taxes to the State of California within one year of \n2 \n\n1  the connnencement of this action.  As a taxpayer, plaintiff Farrell has no administrative \n2  remedies to exhaust.  Ms. Farrell's nephew, Edward Jermaine Brown, is a CYA ward. \n3  She brings this action as a taxpayer, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526a, \n4  against state official Jerry L. Harper, Director of the CYA, to enjoin his expenditure of \nI \n5  funds to promulgate, administer, and enforce the CYA's illegal policies, practices, and \n6  procedures. \n7  B.  Defendant \n8  6.  Jerry L. Harper is the Director of the CYA   and is sued herein in that \n9  capacity.  As Director, Ha..rper is responsible for the operation of all the CYA staff and \n10  facilities, including decisions concerning the budget, staff deployment, progrannning, and \n11  staff training that directly affect the expenditure of funds on CYA wards. \n12  7.  Defendant uses tax revenues collected from plaintiff Farrell and others by \n13  the State of California to administer, operate, and maintain CYA facilities. \n14  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n15  8.  The CYA   is a state agency charged by law with the rehabilitation of \nI \n16  youthful offenders.  It is required by the California Legislature to substitute training and \n17  treatment for punishment of its wards.  (Welf. & Inst. Code § 1700.)  The CYA houses \n18  approximately 6,000 male and female wards in eleven correctional facilities.  Defendant \nI \n19  Harper uses public funds to further illegal actions, as described in paragraphs 9-113 \n20  below. \n21  9.  The CYA, by its own admission, utterly fails to fulfill its statutory duties of \n22  treatment, training, and rehabilitation.  For example, the CY A admits that it does not \n23  provide wards at N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility with adequate treatment \nI \n24 I and progrannning services.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2001-02; Budget Concept Paper \n~ \n25  FY 2002-03.)  Staff at this CYA facility, which houses some of the most at-risk youth in \n1 \n26  the system, are \"unable to provide quality treatment to wards due [to  the high number of \n27  difficult and complex cases at the facility.\"  Without additional staff, \"N.A. Chaderjian \n28  will continue to operate without adequate treatment services, which leads to an unsafe \n3 \n\n1  environment for staff and wards,\"  Wards at Ventura Youth Correctional Facility are also \n2  \"consistently denied the treatment services to which they are entitled\" by California law, \n3  according to the Office of the Inspector General in a Management Review Audit on June \n4  2002, \n5  10,  More generally, the CYA's own Treatment Delivery Focus Group found in \n6  November 2001 that, because untrained, inexperienced correctional officers are staffing \n7  counselor positions, \"we are unable to effectively deliver treatment and training to the \n8  wards under our care and supervision,\"  (Memorandum from Treatment Delivery Focus \n9  Group to Deputy Director Anderson, November 16, 2001.)  One result of the CYA's \n10  failure to provide rehabilitation to wards is that \"wards are give[u] time-adds because \nI \nI \n11  their board ordered programs cannot be met.\"  In other words, the CYA's illegal actions \n12  result in lengthier sentences for wards, thus requiring taxpayers to fund due process \nl3  violations. \n14  11,  Defendant Harper has long been aware of the CYA's chronic, serious \n15  illegalities,  As the CYA   states: \n16  In August 2000 the department nerformed an analysis of critical issues and \nreports\"\" The analysis revealecfthe following broad areas of concerns: \n17  conditions of confinement; use of force; safety and security; manaEement of \npolicy, procedure and practice; correctional treatment centers; staff \n18  resources and training; ward rights; drug and sex offender treatment; \neducation services; leadership; gangs; research; and [] documentation,  In \n19  practically every issue, inconsistent policy, procedure and practice was \neither explicitly noted or implied as an underlying factor.\" \n20 \n(Budget Change Proposal EX03A, FY 2002-03,)  The illegal conditions in the CYA have, \n21 \nanything, worsened since that time, \n22 \nA.  Physical Safety of Wards \n23 \n12,  CYA   staff regularly subject wards to the excessive use of force,  The \n24 \npolicies and procedmes are not adequate to ensure the physical safety of wards under the \n25 \ncare and protection of the CYA and to protect them from abuse by CY A staff that is \n26 \ncruel, willfully inhumane, and excessive,  The CYA spends taxpayer funds illegally by \n27 \nnot ensuring that the lawful policies now in place are properly implemented and that staff \n28 \n4 \n\n1  are trained to follow them. \n2  13.  It is common practice within the CYA for staff andlor guards to slam a \n3  ward down, pull his arms behind his back, force a knee into his back, and use excessive \n4  amounts of Mace or other chemical agents even after the ward is restrained.  Wards also \n5  have their heads slanuned against walls and rails and are beaten and burned by tear gas \n6  canisters and Maced without provocation.  For example, a ward was repeatedly sprayed \n7  with chemical agents for declining to undergo a strip search after being placed in a \n8 II  holding room.  In another example, a ward was knocked unconscious when shot directly \n9  in the head at close range by CYA staff with a \"foam baton\" gun.  In a third example, \n10  CYA officers placed a handcuffed ward face down on a bed and repeatedly struck his \nII  head. \n12  14.  Although California law mandates that chemical restraints shall be used \n13  only to restrain wards, and not for punishment or retaliation (Cal. Code of Regs., tit.  15, § \n14  4040( d)), CYA   staff often use chemical agents on wards who either do not require \n15  restraining or already are restrained.  Additionally, staff place other excessive restrictions \n16  on wards, in the form of restraint chairs and \"spit masks\" (which often must be worn by \n17  wards for a month or more) or confinement to a temporary detention or suicide watch \n18 room for extended periods of time without legitimate justification. \n1 \n19  15.  Many CYA staff do not abide by the rules and policies that currently exist \nI \n20  to govern the use of force on wards.  The policies are often not provided to staff, and staff \n21  training is inadequate.  In addition, the CYA   administration has failed to provide \nI \nI \n22  individual institutions with oversight and clear policy direction on the use of force.  Staff \n23  !I  often fail to report the use of force and the CYA   does not adequately investigate use-of-\n241 \nforce incidents or discipline staff when appropriate.  As a resnlt of these failures, CY A' s \n25  use-of-force policies are not implemented, which causes and exacerbates the illegalities \n26  of the CY A system. \n16.  Moreover, some ofthe use-of-force policies are themselves unlawful.  For \nexample, there is no standardized CYA policy governing use of spit masks.  The CYA's \n5 \n\n1  chemical restraints policy does not set dosage limits on the use of chemical restraints. \n2  The policies and procedures for inventory controls and records for weapons, ammunition, \n3  and chemical agents are inadequate., Without adequate policies and procedures, there is \n4  insufficient management control over the use of force and the application of chemicals on \n5  wards. \n6  17.  The San Luis Obispo County Grand Jury, in its investigation of the CYA's \n7  Paso Robles Youth Correctional Facility in 2000,  found that \"[a]ccountability procedures \n8  are ineffective for signaling possible unauthorized use of chemical restraint by individual \n9  employees, nor are other adequate safeguards in place.\"  For example, the Grand Jury \n10  found excessive use of chemical restraints at Cambria Cottage, the Paso Robles lockup \n11  unit: \"[T]here has been an excessive use of chemical restraint.  F oggers have been used \n12  there as weapons for individual punishments as well as for extracting some wards from \n13  their cells.\" \n14  18.  Defendant Harper also has failed to develop sufficient policies and \n15  procedures to protect the physical safety of wards from abuse by other wards and has \n16  failed to implement the policies and procedures that do exist.  For example, many CYA \n17  facilities house victims of sexual violence and/or homosexual wards with convicted sex \n18  offenders.  Wards who are homosexual or who are known to have been victimized in the \ni \nI \n19  past are the most frequent targets of sexual assault.  Thus, the CYA   is exposing some of \n20  [ its most vulnerable wards to some of its most dangerous. \n21  19.  Rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment are common within the CY A. \n22  Some wards are housed in the same living facility as others who have previously raped or \n23  sexually assaulted them.  Staff are routinely indifferent to wards' pleas for protection \nI \n24  from those who have assaulted them...  .. ,  .. \n25  20.  Defendant Harper has falled to Implement the CYA sown gmdelmes for \n26  responding to wards' repOlis of sexual assault, including failing to investigate such \n27  allegations promptly and properly, and has failed to develop and implement policies to \n28  ensme that CYA   staff members receive instruction in dealing with sexual assault aud are \n6 \n\n1  held accountable when they disregard policy.  As a result, sexual assaults in the CYA are \n2  common and often go unpunished. \n3  21.  The California Correctional Peace Officers Association reports, for \n4  example, that violent female wards at Ventura \"prey on weaker/mentally ill wards\" and \n5  \"management... has no plan to defuse, eliminate or reduce violence within the female \n6  population.\"  (CCPOA Agenda, CYA Director's Meeting, Tuesday, August 15,2000.) \n7  22.  Defendant Harper has also failed to establish policies and procedures to \n8  protect wards from the well-known and ubiquitous danger of attack by gang members and \n9  does not have a consistent policy for dealing with gang-related violence.  Moreover, he \nJ. 0  has failed to provide intervention services for gang conflict.  The use oflong-term \n11  lockdowns as the sole response to gang violence results in more physical violence \n12  because wards are simply locked in their rooms for weeks or months with no \n13  progranunmg. \n14  23.  Gang-related violence occurs in the form of both one-on-one attacks and \n.\" \n1511 \nlarge-group disturbances.  Wards often are seriously injured in such attacks, which often \n16  involve dangerous weapons such as knives or similar objects.  The CY A does not have \n17  adequate policies and procedures to ensure that wards do not have access to material that \n18  can be made into dangerous weapons.  For example, debris such as broken glass, nails, a \nI \nI \n19  tent stake, a 12-inch piece of pipe, a six-inch piece of metal, and an l8-inch strand of \n20  . rope have been left in the comer of a sports field, accessible to wards, in a CY A facility. \n21  Moreover, CYA staff fail to search wards for weapons to prevent contraband from \n22  entering the facilities and fail to use metal detectors properly. \n23  24.  In addition to their failure to prevent ward-on-ward violence, CYA staff \nI \n24 II  have encouraged, permitted, and/or provided wards with the opportunity to fight one \n25  another.  . \n1  ' \n26  B.  Segregation \n1\n27  25.  CYA   wards are subjected to extremely harsh punishment in the form of \n28  \"lockup,\" \"Temporary Detention,\" \"disciplinary housing,\" placement on \"Special \n7 \n\n1  Management Units\" (SMU), and \"lockdowns.\"  Such punishment is effected either by \n2  sending a ward to a special housing unit used specifically for such punishment or by \n3  changing the rules of confinement for a ward or group of wards while they remain in \n4  regular housing units. \n5 I  26.  The physical conditions within special lockup units are often abysmaL \nI \n6  Defendant Harper has failed to establish policies and procedures adequate to protect the \nI \n7  rights of wards undergoing such punishment.  He has also failed to ensure that the \n8  policies now in place are properly implemented aud that staff are trained to follow them. \n9  27.  Many CYA lockup rooms are filthy, with dried mucus, blood, and/or feces \n10 I on the walls, unusable toilets, aud broken windows.  Wards are subject to obvious health \n11  II  risks from these unsauitary, unconstitutional, aud illegal conditions.  Wards on lockup are \n12  often fed only \"blender meals,\" which are entire meals (e.g., a saudwich, vegetable, and \n13  milk) that have been put into a blender and liquified aud then fed to the ward via a straw \nI \n14  through his or her cell door.  In other examples, wards confined on lockup have received \n15  inadequate rations or dangerously undercooked food, causing these youths to lose \n16 significaut amounts of weight. \n17 I1   28.  Wards' activities while on lockup are so severely limited as to be punitive. \n18  Wards live under a regime called \"2311,\" which forces them to stay inside their cells for \n19  23 hours of the day aud provides only one hour of \"program\" time ontside of the cell, \n20  which takes place in cages called Special (or Secure) Program Areas or \"SPAs.\"  Thus, \n21  when wards on lockup are allowed to attend educational classes or counseling sessions, \n22  they are required to do so either in a cage or through a small slot in the cell door.  Wards \n\"I  \n23  on lockup often are not pennitted access to reading material, television, or radio and their \nI \n24  opportunities to keep in contact with their families through telephone calls and visits are \n25  eliminated or severely curtailed.  Although CYA   policy mandates that wards on lockup \n26  shall be given the opportunity for one hour of large-muscle exercise outside of their \n27  rooms each day, in practice this regulation is ignored and wards on lockup can go for \n28  many months with little or no exercise. \n8 \n\nI  29.  Wards often are not allowed to attend school or any other form of program, \n2  including religious services, while in segregation.  Wards are denied parole because they \n3  cannot complete required programs in lockup; they then serve their maximum telID and \n4  are released from the CYA   with dishonorable discharges.  The California Department of \n5  Education investigated the CYA's delivery of special education services to wards on \n6  lockdown or temporary detention and fOlmd that the CYA   \"is not consistently \n7  implementing the IEPs [Individual Education Plans] ofwards/students in the restricted \n8  program\" and that \"IEP team meetings are not conducted when a ward is placed in the \n9  restricted program as directed in the CYA  's Restricted Program policy manual\" and as \n10  required under federal law.  (California Department of Education Compliance Report #I-\n11  1079-00/01, September 14, 2001.) \n12  30.  Wards in segregation are there primarily due to the CYA's determination \n13  that they have misbehaved or failed to follow mandated programs.  However, they are not \n14  provided with any behavior modification or rehabilitative programs to train them to \n15  improve their conduct. \n16  31.  Many wards with serious mental illnesses are held in lockup under these \n17  extremely harsh and restrictive conditions, which exacerbates their mental illnesses and \n181 \ncauses them to decompensate. \n19  32.  CYA wards spend an alarming amount of time in segregation.  The CYA's \n20  policies and practices on locking wards up in segregation are so excessive as to violate \n21  accepted professional practices, particularly for wards who are mentally ill andlor \n22  . suicidal \nI \n23  33.  For example, a pastoral delegation to Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional \n24  Facility reported in a document sent to Mr. Harper on November 27,2001, that they were \n25  shocked and depressed by the isolation and the use of cages, or as you call \nthem SPAs.  The accommodations were, in our opinion, mhumane.  We \n26  were also alarmed by the length of time the young men spend in isolation. \nMany we talked to had been there several months already and were not sure \n27  when they would return to the main population. \n28  The delegation of clergy further stated regarding the lockup units at Nelles: \"The paucity \n9 \n\n1  of education, physical exercise, religious programming and social interaction for young \n2  people of this age is nothing short of abnsive.\"  The CYA   chaplain's group pointed out \n3  similar dangers to Mr. Harper, stating: \n4  There have been three suicides in the CYA system since Febmary.  We are \nhearing from the wards that the amount of time they spend in theIr rooms \n5  agitates the stress and tensions that they already expenence by being locked \nup.  The over use of solitary confmement (23-1) including their length of \n6  stay m solItary confmement U11lts and the use of SPAs for theIr one honr out \nof their rooms also contributes to this concern.  Many wards have confided \n7  to us that they are hesitant to se~k help for stress or depression for fear that \nthey WIll be put on SUICIde watch, which IS worse than solItary confinement. \n8  Isolation[] increases the likelihood of suicide, it does not decrease it. \n9  34.  The CYA   admits that its policies regarding the use of restricted programs \n10  lack consistent placement criteria and are marked by the \"inconsistent delivery of \n11  mandated services in the areas of education, recreation, telephone calls, visiting, ward \n12  grievances, legal resonrces, religious services, mail, nutrition, clothing/bedding, mental \n13  health services and counseling and treatment.\"  (Budget Change Proposal EX03A, FY \n14  2002-03.)  In addition, the CYA admits to having  \"no consistent monitoring of tt'1e use \n! \n15  of 23/1 restricted programs.\"  Furthennore, the CYA   is aware that its use of cages in the \nI \n16  restricted programs is ineffective and cmel: the CYA  's own Special Programs \n17  Administrator has recommended \"complete removal of all special program areas [SPAs J \n18  with time of the essence.  These hardware devices are used in a similar marmer to other \n19  mechanical restraints in the absence of intensive treatment interventions and should not \n20  be used alternatively ... [1]t is a matter of general knowledge that the CUlTent excessive use \n21  oflong term 'lock down' facilities to manage behavior problems exceed any reasonable \n22  standards for juvenile facilities.\" \n23  35.  Thus, under defendant Harper, the CYA disregards wards' due process \n24  rights in committing them to lockup units or disciplinary housing.  Defendant Harper has \n25 II  failed to promulgate adequate procedures to permit wards to challenge their placement in \n26  lockup units.  As a result, he is operating the CYA, and spending taxpayer money, \n27  illegally. \n28  36.  CYA wards are disciplined through a process called the Disciplinary \n10 \n\n1  Decision Making System (DDMS).  Wards subject to DDMS proceedings are often \n2  denied the opportunity to present their cases, to present witnesses in their favor or to \n3  question witnesses testifYing against them.  Often, hearings are not held in a timely \nI \n4  marmer and wards' cases are heard by biased decisiomnakers.  Often wards are \n, \n5  disciplined arbitrarily, with no explanation for why the disciplinary action is being taken. \n6  37.  Wards often do not receive notice of the reason for their placement in \n7  lockup.  Under CYA   policy, wards can be placed in a lockup unit for up to five weeks \n8  without a hearing on the necessity for restricted housing or on the disciplinary charge.  In \n9  practice, wards often are locked up for many months at a time and up to a year without \n10  periodic review of their status. \n11  38.  Wards are involuntarily housed in lockup units purportedly for their own \n12  protection without providing them with an opportunity to challenge the decision.  In other \n13  cases, the CYA   actually creates the need for protective custody by knowingly transferring \n14  wards to a facility where the gang or ethnic group to which they belong is vastly \n15  outnumbered by rival groups, rendering them unable to live safely in the general \n16  population. \n17  39.  Although CYA policy requires that administrative lockdowns (program \nI \n18  restrictions placed on a group of wards, even entire facilities, due to safety and security \n19  concerns) last only so long as necessary to restore safety of the facility, the CYA often \n20  extends the administrative lockdown well beyond the time in which the security threat \n21  has been identified and addressed, in violation of wards' due process rights.  The CY A \n22  also places and keeps wards illlockdown based on their racial/ethnic status or pUlported \n23  group affiliation rather than their actual threat to safety and security. \n24 Ii  40.  Lockdown conditions parallel the harsh deprivations found in the lockup \n25\\1 \nconditions described above.  However, defendant Harper has failed to take appropriate \n26 I measures to mitigate the extreme hardship and severe program restrictions placed on \n27  wards on lockdowns for extended periods of time, thus ensuring that they are not \n28  provided with programs that are required to be available even during a period of \n11 \n\n1  heightened security, \n2  41,  Defendant Harper has long been aware of the illegalities regarding the \n3  CYA's segregation policies and practices,  A \"Standards Development Project\" document \n4  dated November 9,2000, identifies severe problems with education, mental health care, \n5  and recreation delivery for wards on 23/1 and other restricted programming,  A \"Security \n6  Review Report\" regarding lockup at the O.H. Close Youth Correctional Facility found \n7  numerous violations in August 2000, including the following: cages (\"SPAs\") are used \n8  for the one-hour per day of large muscle exercise for wards; \"[t]he current staffing pattern \n9  on Iuyo Lockup Unit is insnfficient, and stretches the existing resources to dangerous \n10  levels when problems occur\"; \"[t]here is no clear indication on the unit as to which wards \nI \n11  are on suicide watch\"; \"ward rooms are in need of cleaning and maintenance\"; wards on \n12  temporary detention are not receiving special education; some wards slept on mattresses \n13  on the floor; loose rocks and cut wood (potential weapons) littered the ground, and \n14  wards' movement was often uumonitored (which allows for attacks by wards on other \n15  . wards), \n16  42,  In addition, a Youth and Adult Correctional Agency investigation found in \n17  2000 that \"[w]ards in isolation need adequate and appropriate large muscle exercise in an \n18  appropriate area including some time outside,  The use of caged shower areas or cages \n19  (referred to as secured program areas, or SPAs) as opposed to fenced recreation yards for \n20  large muscle exercise is inappropriate and contrary to good and accepted correctional \n21  practice,\" (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, August 9-11, 2000, and \n22 II  September 6-8,20000) \n23  C.  Medical and Dental Care \n24  43,  CY A wards are denied adequate medical treatment  Defendant Harper has \n25  failed to establish policies and procedures to protect the rights of wards in need of \nI \nI \n26  medical care,  He has also failed to ensure that the policies now in place are implemented \n27  and that qualified staff are hired in adequate numbers and are trained to follow the \n28  policies, \n12 \n\nII \n1  44.  The CYA   has insufficient numhers of qualified medical staff, including \n2  physicians, nurses and Medical Technical Assistants (MTAs).  For example, Preston \n3  Youth Correctional Facility only has one doctor, with no relief available when he is sick \n4  or on vacation.  The CYA admits this staffing is seriously inadequate.  (Budget Concept \n5  Paper, FY 2002-03.) \n45.  In another example, EI Paso de Robles Youth Correctional Facility cannot \n61 \nmeet the medical needs of its more than 750 wards.  The entire medical department staff \n71 \n8  informed the facility's Superintendent on May 31,2001, that they did not have enough \n9  nurses to fulfill \"public health aspects of vaccinations and infectious diseases significant \n10  to this at-risk population of teenage males.\"  They further stated that \"[i]t is clear that the \n11  imbalance between demands for medical and mental health care services mandated by the \n12  law, and staff responsible for responding to those demands, has reached a near alarming \n13  level at our institution.  In order to comply with the law and adhere to the agency's \n14  policies and procedures, and to uphold the ethical standards of medical and mental health \n15  care in providing treatment and rehabilitation for the wards, our institution is in urgent \n1, \n16  need of a least one additional registered nurse, one MTA   [medical technical assistant \n17i \nfour additional psychologists, and one fulI-time psychiatrist.\" \n18  46.  The CYA admits it does not have adequate staff to provide basic nursing \n19  care for its wards, including medication administration, daily sick call, infections disease \n20  screening and follow-up, immunizations, and urgent/emergent care.  Medication is \nI \n21  delivered by unlicenced staff, which has resulted in failure to document the \n22  I administration of the medication and an inability to monitor its effectiveness.  Wards \nL~e~)   have no opportunity to ask questions about the medication and no chance to weigh the \n24  results of refusal.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.) \n25  47.  The medical staff that the CYA   does have are inadequately trained and \n26  supervised. \n27  48.  Wards who require medical care are subjected to lengthy delays, including \n28  delays to see a primalY physician, to obtain a refenal to see a specialist, to see a specialist \n13 \n\n1  after obtaining the referral, to obtain medical testing, and to obtain treatment.  For \n2  example, a pregnant ward at Ventnra Youth Correctional Facility was not provided with a \n3  timely consultation with a specialist.  As a result, the ward did not receive adequate \n4  treatment for her urinary infection, which contributed to her subsequent premature \n5  delivery.  In addition to the physical and emotional pain and trauma suffered by the ward \n6  and her baby, the hospital bills for the intensive care of the one-pound, eight-ounce baby, \n7  paid by California taxpayers, exceeded $568,000. \n8  49.  The CYA   frequently fails to provide wards with access to care.  Pregnancy \n9  care for female wards is inadequate, according to a Management Review Audit by the \n10  Office of the Inspector General in June 2002.  Often medical staff do not take sufficient \n11  steps necessary to make diagnoses.  When a diagnosis is made or a symptom discovered, \n12 . medical staff often fail to provide treatment.  Several wards have been denied their \nI \n13  requests to be tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, in spite of the \ni \n14  presence of symptoms of such diseases. \n15  50.  The administration and delivery of medications is also seriously inadequate \n16  as, for example, a nurse surveyor found at the four-facility CYA complex called the \n17 I Northern California Youth Correctional Center (DeWitt Nelson, Karl Holton, O.H. Close, \n181 \nand N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facilities).  The serious deficiencies include the \n191 \nfollowing: dates in medical files did not accurately reflect the dates on which medication \n20  was administered; discontinued medications were reprinted with new medication orders; \n21  expired medications, including some more than two years out of date, were being \n22  administered; drug, needle, and syringe-control records were not properly maintained, \nI \n23  nurses poured medications without consulting the medical record and without \n24  documenting the administration; wards refused medication dosages up to 11 times before \n25  the matter was referred to a physician; no daily glucose monitoring for diabetics; \n26  physician orders were not noted by nurses taking orders; sick call with a physician only \n27  once a week (although the National Commission on Conectional Health Care \"Standards \n28  for Health Services in Juvenile Detention and Confinement Facilities\" as well as the \n14 \n\n'I \nI \n1  Institute for Medical Quality standards for juvenile facilities require a minimum of five \n2  days a week for facilities with over 100 wards).  Medication policies were also seriously \n3  deficient in failing to address current practice and failing to cover how to report refusals \n4  of medication or treatment. \n5  51.  Wards' medical records often are disorganized and incomplete and \n6  incoming wards are not adequately screened.  As part of the survey of the Notthern \n7  California Youth Correctional Center in April 2001, an outside expert reviewed the health \n8  record system at the four institutions.  The expert report found inadequate organization, \n9  communication, and follow-up.  The report also found that no system exists to track \n10  consents for routine or psychotropic medications at some facilities, that basic written \nII  policies are not available and not known to staff, and that medical files are lost when \n12  wards are transferred within the CYA  . \n13  52.  The CYA responds inadequately to wards' emergency medical needs due to \n1 \nI \n14  the lack of expertise of custody and medical staff and the unnecessary and inappropriate \nI \n15  placement of custody concerns over emergency medical care. \n16  53.  Defendant Harper has long been aware of serious deficiencies in the CYA  's \n17  medical care system.  In Fall 2000, a Youth and Adult Correctional Agency investigation \n18  found major illegalities regarding the CYA  's medical staffing, administration of \n19  medications to wards (including the use of nurses for \"activities that by law may only be \nII \n20  performed by a pharmacist or physician\") and involuntary medication practices that \nI \n21  diverge from community standards  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, \n22  August 9-11, 2000, and September 6-8, 2000.)  The investigation found that the CYA \n23  \"lacks a systematic approach to delivering medical and mental health services to wards\" \n24  and recommended significant overhauls. \n25  54.  In spite of this evaluation, defendant Harper has failed to develop \n26  meaningful policy guidelines regarding the provision of medical care, including quality \n27  control procedures such as physician peer review, quality assurance and death reviews. \n28  The CYA   admits that the only way to ensure that medical care policies are properly \n15 \n\n1  implemented is to perfonn local compliance inspections.  The CYA does not do so. \n2  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)  Even when serious deficiencies are identified, \n3  there is inadequate follow-up to prevent future problems.  Defendant Harper has also \n4  I failed to ensure that the policies now in place are implemented and that qualified staff are \n5  hired in adequate numbers and are trained to follow them. \n6  D.  Mental Health Care \n7  55.  Wards are denied adequate mental health tTeatment. \n8  56.  The CYA admits that it fails to provide even minimally adequate mental \n9  health care to its wards: \n10  [Tlhe present configuration of mental health IJrograms does \nnot come close to meeting the diverse mental health needs of \nI \n11  our population .... This means that many wards will not \nreceIve the mental health services reqUlred to reduce their \n12  level of danger to the community. Additionally  we will not \nbe able to successfully defend ourselves from the litigation \n13  that has been filed against us in this area. This means that the \ncourts will intercede and order us to provide costly and \n14 .  necessary services. \n1511 \n(Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)  The CYA further admits that it \"lacks \nI \n16  organizational structural, level of care and resources to adequately meet the mental health \n17  treatment needs of the youthful offenders.\"  (Budget Change Proposal Analysis, FY \n18  2002-03.)  Other admissions in the same CYA document include the following: \n19  • The Department does not have the professional personnel or expertise to \ntroubleshoot or resolve systemic problems related to mental health, consult \n20  on difficult cases or centrally distribute clinical infonnation to mental \nhealth professionals.  These factors impact continuity of patient care and \n21  II  successful transition between programs, and from the institution setting to \nparole. \n!. \n2~L ! \nI  • Many of the deficiencies that the Federal Government discovered in these \n23  other states [successfully sued over the past seven years for unconstitutional \n1 \nconditions  also exist in California.  As 'with the states discussed above, the \n[CYA} does not clillently have a~ organized and integrated delivery system \n241  of mental health sefVIces.  Unul tnese defiCIenCIes are addressed, the \n25  Department is at risk of future litigation with the Federal Goverument. \nI \n26  • Cmrently there is no effective cenu·al coordination of statewide \ndeRartmental mental health services.  Plauning has been reactive, piecemeal \n27  ana fragmented .... There is no oversight to assure consistent treatment and \nappropnate patient care follow-up.  This impacts continuity of patient care, \n28  successful transition between programs and u·ansition from the institutional \n16 \n\n1  setting to parole. \n2  57.  A study by Stanford University psychiatrists found the CYA  ' s \n3  \"organizational culture not conducive to mental health treatment\" and discovered \"a lack \n4  in continuity of care\" for wards.  (Steiner, Humphreys & Redlich, The Assessment of the \n5  Mental Health System of the California Youth Authority, December 31, 2001.) \n6  58.  The CYA also admits it is \"understaffed by all national standards.\" \n7  (Budget Change Proposal Analysis, FY 2002-03.)  The appropriate ratio of psychologists \n8  to wards, by the CYA's own estimates, is 1 :60.  (Jd)  The CYA operates with a ratio of \n9  1: 288.  (Id)  That means the CYA needs an additional 71.5 psychologist positions.  In \n10  addition, the CYA requires an additional 18.6 psychiatrist positions to bring it to the \n11  national standard of 1:200.  (ld)  As discussed above in the section on medical care, the \n12  CYA also admits it does not have adequate staff to provide appropriate basic nursing care \n13  for its wards, including delivery of medications, and admits that the only way to ensure \n14  that medical care policies are properly implemented is to perform local compliance \n15  inspections, which the CYA does not do.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)  The \n16  Stanford study found that all CYA institutions were understaffed and that \"external \n17  forces.\" cause staff to use their time ineffectively.\"  (Steiner, Humphreys & Redlich, The \n18  Assessment of the Mental Health System of the California Youth Authority, December \n19  31,2001.) \n20  59.  For example, El Paso de Robles Youth Correctional Facility cannot meet \nI \n21  the mental health needs of its more than 750 wards.  The entire medical department staff \n221 \ninformed the facility's Superintendent on May 31,2001, that it has \"definite deficiencies\" \n23  ,I  in the mental health care delivery process, due largely to  \"virtually intolerable\" . \n11 \n241 \nworkload.  There is only one full-time psychologist and one part-time contract \n25  psychiatrist (40 hours per month) to serve the needs of more than 750 wards, of whom 91 \n26  have histories of suicide attempts and more than 200 are on the waiting list of \n27  psychological evaluations and/or psychotherapy.  The CYA has admitted similar \n28  deficiencies at the Wintu lTP at the Northern Youth Correctional Reception Center and \n17 \n\n1  Clinic and at the N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility.  (Budget Concept Papers, \n2  FY 2002-03.) \n3  60.  In addition, due to its inadequate staffmg the CYA   cannot meet its legal \ni \n4  obligation to provide evaluations for those wards that the Youthful Offender Parole Board \n5  (YOPB) seeks to retain in custody following their original discharge date.  If the YOPB \n6  determines that a ward would be dangerous to the public due to a \"mental or physical \n7  I deficiency, disorder, or abnormality,\" it may seek to retain the ward for an additional two \n8  years by requesting the prosecutor to petition the court for such an order.  (Welf. & lnst \n9  § 1800.)  Mental health evaluations prepared by CYA staff are essential to this process. \n10  However, they are often improperly and inadequately prepared, often presenting \n11  inaccurate information and based on a lack of knowledge on the part of staff generating \nI \n12  the rep0l1.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2000-01; Budget Change Proposal Analysis, FY \n13 2002-03.)  Reports are also often late, which the CYA admits can and does \"result in the \n14  premature release of an offender clinically assessed as mentally ill and recognized by \n1 \n15  staff as dangerous to the public safety.\"  (Budget Change Proposal Analysis, FY 2002-\n16  03.) \n17  61.  The CYA   has an inadequate number of treatment beds.  According to the \n18  . CYA  ' s own analysis, there are only 523 mental health beds available to serve a \n19  population of at least 3,173 wards requiring treatment.  (Budget Change Proposal \n20  Analysis, FY 2002-03.) \n21  62.  Medical records are disorganized and incomplete and mental health \n22  assessment is inadequate.  For example, female wards at Ventura Youth Conectional \n23  Facility do not receive timely mental health assessments.  (Office of the Inspector \n24  General, Management Review Audit, Ventura Youth Correctional Facility, June 2002.) \n25  CYA   staff inappropriately rely on an unreliable screening tool to determine the required \n26  level of care.  In addition, CYA staff do not clearly identify and flag files for wards who \n27  have suicide histories.  Documentation regarding suicide risks is inadequately maintained \n28  in the files and Suicide Risk Lists are improperly maintained.  (Report to the Director on \n18 \n\n1  Compliance with the Suicide Prevention Assessment and Response Policy, November 1, \n2  2001.) \n3  63.  Administration of medication is so haphazard as to be dangerous to wards. \n4  The nurse surveyor report regarding conditions at the N orthem California Youth \nI \n5  Correctional Center found numerous deficiencies described above in the section on \n6  medical care (Paragraphs 43-54) that apply as well to administration of psychiatric \n7  medications.  In addition, the report found that court-ordered psychiatric medications \n8  were not administered.  The Stanford study found that \"modem psychopharmacology\" is \n9  not practiced in the CYA  .  It is impossible for the CYA   to monitor administration and \n10  effectiveness of psychotropic medications with a dearth of menta! health professionals. \n11  64.  Wards who are suicidal or self-mutilating do not receive adequate care or \n12  treatment.  At least one ward has successfully committed suicide as a result of inadequate \nI \n13  care.  Wards who are placed on suicide watch are not properly monitored and they do not \n14  receive sufficient clinical intervention.  (Report to the Director on Compliance with the \n15  Suicide Prevention Assessment and Response Policy, November 1,2001.)  Instead of \n16  direct physical observation, wards are placed in \"camera rooms,\" where their activities \n17  are intermittently monitored by video.  These \"camera rooms\" are often filthy and unsafe \n18  and have not been modified to eliminate fixtures that could be used by a ward to commit \n19  suicide.  CYA policies inappropriately permit wards to be retained in \"camera rooms\" for \n20  three days regardless oftheif mental condition, thereby imposing punishment on wards \n21  for seeking mental health services.  For example, ward Darren Striplin has been \n22  diagnosed with severe depression, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder and \n23  is taking several medications for these conditions.  Nevertheless, when Darren has been \n2411 \non suicide watch at Chaderjian, his visits with the psychiatrists rarely last longer than \n25  about five minutes and he is not provided with counseling or any other treatment. \n26  65.  Wards who attempt suicide are often punished by being restricted to their \n27  rooms for a set number of days.  Enforced isolation is dangerous and unnecessarily \n28  pmlitive.  The CYA chaplain's group told Mr. Harper in October 2001 (quoted above in \n19 \n\n1  the section on Segregation at Paragraph 33) that the practice of holding wards in isolation \n2  for excessive amounts of time caused them concerns for wards' mental health, \n3  particularly for those wards who are already suicidal. \nII \n41 \n66.  Suicidal wards also receive mental health care while locked in cages.  As \nI \n5  quoted above in the section on Segregation at Paragraph 33, a pastoral delegation to Fred \n6  C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility informed Mr. Harper on November 27, 2001, that \n7  they found the cages, or SPAs, inhumane and were shocked at the sight of a suicidal ward \n8  receiving counseling in a cage, with the psychologist halfway across the room. \n9  67.  Staff are not adequately trained on the use of cut -down tools (to rescue \n10  wards who attempt to hang themselves), and the tools' location is not standardized. \n11  (Report to the Director on Compliance with the Suicide Prevention Assessment and \n12  Response Policy, November 1, 2001.)  As an internal CYA report informed defendant \n13  Harper a year ago, this means that new staff might not be able to find the tools, and the \n14  delay could be fatal. \nII \n15  68.  Many wards have been involuntarily medicated with psychotropic drugs for \n1611 \nbehavior problems and without clinical justification.  Involuntary medication often is \n17 II  administered without a hearing and, if the ward is a minor, without the legally required \n18  consent of a parent or guardian.  The nurse surveyor report regarding conditions at the \n19  four-facility Northern California Youth Correctional Center found that psychotropic \n20  medications are administered without signed consents.  For example, ward Edward \n211 \nJermaine Brown was subjected to inappropriate forced medication that was administered \n221  without appropriate review by clinical staff.  He was coerced into taldng psychotropic \n23  medication by threats oflonger periods of solitalY confinement.  Although Jermaine was \n24  a minor, he was given psychotropic medication without the consent of a parent or \n25  guardian, even though CYA clinical staff have acknowledged that such consent is legally \n26  required. \n27  69.  Defendant Harper has long known of the inadequacies of the CY A's mental \n28  health care delivery system.  A CYA   Mental Health Strategic Plan Committee met in \n20 \n\nI' \n1  March 2000 and acknowledged that \"[t]he current array of treatment programs do not \n2  meet the mental health needs of a significant portion of the YA population.\"  In February \n3  2001, the Chief of the Health Care Services Division wrote to Mr. Harper stating that \n4\\ CYA does not have enough psychologists or psychiatrists.  He reported that 70 additional \nI \n5  psychology positions must be filled to bring the CYA up to national standards. \n61 \n70.  Despite his awareness of these systemic illegalities, defendant Harper has \n7  failed to develop meaningful policy guidelines regarding the provision of mental health \n8  care, including quality control procedures such as physician peer review, quality \n9  assurance and death reviews.  Even when serious deficiencies are identified, there is \n10  inadequate follow-up to correct them.  Defendant Harper has also failed to ensure that the \n11  policies now in place are implemented and that qualified staff are hired in adequate \n12  numbers and are trained to follow the policies.  The CYA's failure to treat mentally ill \n13  wards is dangerous to them and to all Californians.  According to staff at the Fred C. \n14  Nelles Youth Correctional Facility, \"many of our most dangerous and dysfunctional \n15  wards are simply released back into the courrnunity when they reach their maximum \n16  confmemeht, having received little to no psychological services.\"  The \"most dangerous \n171 \nremain isolated ... and become more and more dysfunctional due to the lack of healthy \n18  interpersonal contact.\"  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2002-03.) \n]9  E.  Programming/Rehabilitation \n20  71.  Under defendant Harper, the CYA does not provide wards with the general \n21  II  treatment, programming, and rehabilitation to which they are entitled under California \n- I \n2L  ,l<a  w. \n23  (a) Education \n24  72.  Wards do not receive adequate access to education. \n25  73.  F or years, the CYA   administration has been aware of chronic, serious \n26  deficiencies in the CYA education system and has not corrected them.  Wards typically \n27  . receive only a fraction of the educational program to which they are legally entitled, the \n28  work they receive does not tTack their high school graduation plan, and they often are not \n21 \n\n1  given credit for work completed while in segregation.  Wards are required to have a high \n2  school graduation plan, but the CYA's educational services often fail to provide the \n3  classes wards need to graduate from high school. \n4  74.  Califomia Education Code section 46141 requires 240 minutes of education \n5  per student per day.  The CYA does not provide students with this statutory requirement. \n6  For example, in fiscal year 2000-01, wards at Ventura Youth Correctional Facility \n7  received \"only 54% of their assigned educational programming\" and an average of 644 \n8  classes were cancelled each month.  (Office of the Inspector General, Management \n9  Review Audit, Ventura Youth Correctional Facility, June 2002.)  Paso Robles wards who \n10  participate in the substance abuse program are prohibited from going to schooL  Wards in \n11  school at O.H. Close Youth Correctional Facility were held back from school to act as \n12  janitors on their living units. \n13  75.  There are several reasons for the CYA's failure to meet legal educational \n14  requirements.  First, theCYA does not have enough teachers.  A CYA teachers' group \n15  stated in 2002 that \"the problem of under-staffing, insufficient training, and lack of \n16  adequate classroom space still exists as it did iIi 1990,\" when the CYA was successfully \nI \n171  sued over its failure to provide the statutorily required special education to wards. \n18 . (Committee of Concerned Educators of Northern Califomia Youth Authority and the \n19  California State Employee Association - SEIU Local 1000, The Matthews Report, p. 7.) \n20  The report continued, \"[c]lasses are closed due to chronic under-staffing,\" among other \n21  reasons, and \"[m]inutes of direct instruction in appropriate classroom settings have \n22  decreased, due to the department's insistence on forcing their faculty out onto crowded, \n23  dangerous living units each day to pass packets of materials through cracks in cell doors.\" \n241  Despite serious staffing shortages, the CYA   took steps in MaTch 2002 to layoff 91 \n25  temporary and part-time staff, 40 of whom provided special education services. \n26  76.  Second, substitute teachers are either nonexistent or present in such \n27  inadequate numbers that classes are often simply cancelled when the regular teacher is \n28  unavailable. \n22 \n\n1  77.  Third, students on temporary detention, lockup and Special Management \n2  Units are denied the educational services required by law.  For example, the federal \n3  Depmtment of Education found in 2002 that non-English-speaking wards in the CYA   are \n4  often not provided with educational services during lockdown.  (Letter from Director \n5  Stefan Rosenzweig to CYA Superintendent, Education Services Branch, of February 1, \n6  2002.)  Wards on \"restricted program\" or segregation do not get their legally mandated \n7  special education services.  (California Department of Education Compliance Report # 1-\n8  1079-00/01, September 14, 2001.) \n9  78.  Not only does the CYA fail to provide students with the quantity of general \n10  ' educational services required by law, the CYA does not provide statutorily prescribed \n11  special education services, such as tutors or special education classes.  Wards with \n12  disabilities are not tested, they are not provided with necessary behavior assessments and \n13  ,support, and the CYA   does not have adequate educational psychologists to provide \n14  necessary services.  Conversely, some wards receive schoolwork that is not challenging, \n15  I is redundant and is inappropriate for their skill level. \nI \n16  79.  Approximately 34 percent ofCYA's high school population, or 1,700 . \nI \n17  wards, receive special education.  (California Department of Education Compliance \n18  Report #1-1079-00/01, September 14, 2001.)  These students do not receive all of their \n19  required Individual Education Plan (IEP) services, in large part because special education \n20  is even more severely understaffed than regular education programming.  For example, in \n21  June 2002, wards were provided with only 208 hours of Special Day Classes at Dewitt \n22  Nelson High School, although their IEPs called for 350; at NA Chaderjian, only 1,249 \nhours of Special Day Classes were provided, despite wards' need for 1,412; at Johanna \n24  Boss High School, only 3,556 hours were provided, despite wards' need for 4,183; at \nI \n25  Marie C. Romero High School, only 1,472 hours were provided, despite wards' need for \n26  2,439; at Mary B. Perry High School, only 968 hours were provided, despite wards' need \nI \n27  for 1,148; at Lyle Egan High School, only 1,937 hours were provided, despite wards' \n28  need for 2,235.  In sum, in just one month, wards at these CYA   high schools were not \n23 \n\n1  provided with thousands of hours of special education classes legally required by their \n2  IEPs.  Moreover, as discussed above in the section on Segregation, wards on restricted \n3  programming are regularly denied required special education services. \n4  80.  Wards are frequently required, as a condition for parole, to obtain a General \n5  Education Degree (GED) and/or high school diploma.  Wards who are prevented from \n'I \n6  meeting these goals due to lack of educational opportunities have decreased chances of \n7  being released on parole, and may have to \"max out\" their time at CYA  , receiving a \n8  dishonorable discharge.  This violation of wards' rights to education requires California \n9  taxpayers to pay additional, urmecessary funds to keep them in custody. \n10  81.  The federal Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) found \n11  extensive deficiencies in the CYA  's educational system for non-English speaking wards \n12  ' in 2002.'  The OCR \"considers these problems to be major and of serious concern.\" \n13  (Letter from Director Stefan Rosenzweig to CYA Superintendent, Education Services \n14  Branch, of February 1,2002.)  As a general matter, the CYA \"is not providing the \n15  instruction and services called for in its plan to teach students English and provide them \n16  an equal opportunity to access the core curriculum.\"  Other deficiencies include the \n17  following: the CY A \"does not have an adequate system for ensuring that the program for \n18  [English learner1  s tudents is fully and appropriately implemented at all sites\"; the CY A \n19  \"has no ability to collect, access, track and review system-wide data\" on these students; at \nI \n20  many schools, staff do not place English Jeamers in the appropriate classes; and most \n21  II  CY A teachers who teach English leamers \"do not have the certification or training \n22  necessary to meet the needs of those students,\" in part because the CYA does not keep \n23  accurate records of such certifi.cation and training.  Many of these problems were also \n24  found in the federal Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights compliance \n25 \n26 \n'The CY A estimates that 13-14 percent of its non-graduate students are limited \n27 \nEnglish proficiency.  (Letter from Director Stefan Rosenzweig to CYA   Superintendent of \n28  Education, December 30, 1999.) \n24 \n\n1  review of the CYA in 1999.  (Letter from Director Stefan Rosenzweig to CYA \n2  Superintendent of Education, December 30, 1999.) \n3  (b) Substance abuse treatment \n4  82.  Substance abuse treatment in the CYA is grossly inadequate.  Tluee \n5  quarters of all wards committed to the CYA   have histories of drug use and 60 percent \nI \n6  (approximately 3,600 of the CYA's population of 6,000) have been identified as serious \n7  substance abusers.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)  However, the CYA does not \n8  have adequate numbers of substance abuse treatment beds.  As of April 2002, there are \n9  approximately 998 \"formal\" treatment beds, with 889 wards on the waiting list, and 670 \n10  \"informal\" treatment beds, with 465 wards on the waiting list.  \"Informal\" treatment is \n1 J  defined to include programs that offer as little as eight hours of treatment over a three-\n12  week period.  (1d  ) \n13  83.  Moreover, the substance abuse programs themselves are seriously deficient. \n14  Staff running the programs have little specific training and supervision, and treatment is \nI \n15  provided only sporadically for wa~ds on lockup or lockdown. \n16  .  84.  The fallure to provIde adequate or approprIate substance abuse treatment to \nwards is costly to taxpayers: 40 percent of technical parole revocations of wards \"had a \nprimary violation offense related to drugs.  The cost of returning one of these wards to the \n19  institution for a year is approximately $43,700.\"  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.) \n20  (c) Sex offender treatment \n21  85.  The CYA does not provide adequate treatment for convicted sex offenders. \n22  The CYA   admits it has an inadequate number of treatment beds for sex offenders and it \n23  does not comply with Welfare and Institutions Code section 727.6, which requires sex \n24  offender treatment for wards committed for sexually violent offenses.  (Budget Concept \n25  Paper, FY 2003-04.)  As of April 2002, there are 783 wards in need of sex offender \n26  treatment incarcerated in the CYA   and only 169 specialized treatment beds.  There are an \n27  additional 13 7 \"informal\" sex offender treatment slots, but these programs are inadequate \n28  and ineffective arId are provided by nntrained staff. \n25 \n\n1  86.  This has been a chronic problem in the CYA  : as of March 2001, there were \n2 \n1,102 identified sex offenders in CYA institntions, but only 312 in treatment beds. \n3  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2002-03.)  As of December 1999, there were 1,052 sex \n4  offenders and only 259 placed in treatment beds.  (ld.) \n5  87.  As a result, the majority of sex offenders committed to the CYA   are housed \n6  . in general population with no treatment at all.  The CYA   admits that \"many of these \n7  wards are released to the community without appropriate treatment interventions and \nI \n8  aftercare resources and are at greater risk ofre-offending.\"  (Budget Concept Paper, FY \n9  2002-03). \n10  88.  In addition, sex offenders who cannot attend sex-offender programs ordered \n11  by the Youthful Offender Parole Board due to lack of availability spend a longer time \n12  incarcerated due to the CYA's failures to comply with the law. \n13  (d) Exercise \n14  89.  Defendant Harper has failed to develop and implement policies and \n15  procedures to ensure that wards under the CYA  's care receive adequate opportnnities to \nI . \nI \n16  exercise.  As a result, the CYA does not provide adequate exercise programs to wards and \nII   I'  \n17  wards are confined in unhealthful, punitive conditions.  Wards are regularly forced to \n! \n18  . miss exercise programs if they attend schoo! or church, or even if they shower.  Wards on \n19  lockup or lockdown statns frequently have no access to exercise at all: the one hour per \n20  day they are allowed to spend outside their rooms is typically spent in dog-keunel-type \n21  . cages. \n22\\1  (e) PhYSical Facilities \n23  90.  CYA's inadequate physical facilities create a punitive environment for \n24  wards, render CYA  's statutory duty of rehabiiitation impossible, and put the health of \n25  wards at umeasonable risk of harm.  In many housing units, there are broken windows, \n26  dirty vents, leaky roofs, cracked floor tiles, and inadeqnate plnmbing.  Wards often must \n271 \nendure extreme temperatures.  Often the water is tnrned off in wards' cells for up to four \n28  hours at a time, leaving them unable to flush the toilet or to wash themselves. \n26 \n\n1  91.  Many of the cells are filthy, particularly rooms in lockup units or suicide-\n2  watch rooms, where dried mucus, blood andlor feces on the walls is commonplace.  The \n3  CYA has failed to develop and implement the necessary policies and procedures to \n4  ensure that its physical facilities are adequately maintained. \n5  92.  For example, in one CYA facility, an independent state inspector found that \n6  maintenance was severely deficient and that with problems such as leaky roofs, holes in \n7  ceilings, broken windows, and leaky pipes that had flooded a sidewalk area, the facility \n8  had \"deteriorated to an unacceptable level.\" \n9  93.  There are serious infirmities in the physical facilities used for mental health \n10  diagnosis and treatment, including ward intake at reception centers and suicide watch \nII  facilities. \n12  (f) Religion \n13  94.  CYA wards are denied reasonable access to opportunities to exercise their \n14  religion in violation of the California Constitution, Article I, section 4 (freedom of \nI' \nI \n15  religion) and Welfare and Institutions Code section 1705 (freedom of religion for CYA \nI \n16  wards).  Defendant Harper admitted to systemic problems with wards' ability to access \nI \n17  religious programs in a Memorandum to the Secretary of the Youth and Adult \nI \n181 \nCorrectional Agency dated July 10,2001. \nI \n19  95.  Four months after Mr. Harper wrote to the Secretary of YACA to describe \n20  systemic problems with the CYA  ' s delivery of religious services, the violations remained. \n21  The pastoral delegation to Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facilities found that wards \n22  are often excluded from religious services as punishment.  The CYA   chaplains' group \n23  stated that \"staff restricts the numbers of wards who can attend church services in a \nI \n24  manner that is arbitrary and lacks anything to do with discipline or security issues.\" \nI \n25  (Memorandum from DaaiyA  llah H. Fardam, President of the Youth Authority Chaplains, \n26  to Mr. Harper, October 19, 2001.) \n27  96.  Wards at Fred C. Nelles Youth Conectional Facility in \"lower phases\" \n28  (who are entitled to fewer privileges) are often precluded from any access to religious \n27 \n\nII \n'I \n'I \n1  servIces or programs.  Other lower-phase wards in the CYA must often choose between \n2  dayroom programming or religious programming. \nI \n3  F.  Access to Courts & Redress of Grievances \n4 II  97.  The CYA fails to provide wards with an adequate grievance system. \nII  \n5  Defendant Harper, as head of the CYA, is required to \"establish and maintain a fair, \n6  simple, and expeditious system for resolution of grievances of all persons committed to \n7  the Youth Authority.\"  (Weif. & Inst. Code § 1766.5.)  In reality, the CYA's grievance \n8  system is ineffectual and unfair. \n9  98.  Although both California law and CYA rules set forth a number of \n10  requirements for the grievance system, in practice these requirements are frequently \n11  disregarded by CYA staff.  (See Welf. & Inst. Code § 1766.5; Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 15, \n12  § 4085 et seq.)  The result is that the CYA grievance system does not afford waTds a fair \nI \n13  opportunity to pursue administrative remedies against the CYA  .  Because exhaustion of \n14  administrative remedies is a requirement for wards who bring lawsuits against the CYA, \n15  the lack of a legitimate grievance system effectively prohibits wards' access to the courts. \n16  99.  Wards are often denied the opportunity even to complete a grievance form. \n17  Even when wards are permitted to submit grievances, they are largely ignored.  Worse \n18  yet, wards are often retaliated against for filing grievances about CYA   staff members, \n191 \neven though under California law, \"[t]he system should provide for safeguards against \n20 I reprisals against any grievant.\"  (Weif. & lnst. Code § 1766.5.) \n21  100.  For example, ward Michael Resendiz attempted to file a grievance for \n22  excessive use of force by staff members at Southern Youth Correctional Reception Center \n23  and Clinic.  Staff refused to provide him with a grievance forID.  Three staff members \n'I \n24  came to Michael shortly thereafter and promised to alter a behavior report writren on him \n25  if he refrained from filing a grievance against staff.  Because Michael feared being sent \n26  back to COUlt or receiving a time add (an additional period of incarceration), he went \n27  along with their scheme and declined to file a grievance. \n28  10 l.  In another example, ward Claudia Medina was given a serious \"Level B\" \n28 \n\n1  write-up at Veutura Youth Correctional Facility for attempting to provide an attorney \n2  with a blank grievance form. \n3  102 .  Wards are also punished for filing \"too many\" grievances and are dissuaded \n4  frorn doing so with the threat of a disciplinary write-up. \nS  103.  The Office of the Inspector General has found serious deficiencies in the \n6  CYA grievance system.  For example, the Inspector General found ~hat \"the quality and \n1 \n7  completeness of the investigations conducted by the [Stark Youth Correctional Facility \n8  and by California Youth Authority's Internal Affairs Unit is suspect.  There is evidence to \n9 I suggest that the management of the California Youth Authority may have failed to act \n10  properly on some of the investigative results.\" At Preston Youth Con'ectional Facility, the \n11  Inspector General found that \"[t]he superintendent's perfOlmance is significantly out of \n12  compliance with laws, regulations, or departmental policy, and immediate attention is \n13  required to remedy the situation.\"  An audit of Nelles Youth Correctional Facility \n14  uncovered the fact that many cases are not fully investigated and that grievances are not \n15  resolved in a timely manuer: 50 percent of the grievances submitted in the four years \n16  . preceding the audit had not been resolved, and several of those unresolved grievances \n17  were \"potentially serious.\" Additionally, the Inspector General found that grievances \n18  against CYA   staff are not investigated in a timely manner, a violation of particular \n19  concern in light ofthe one-year deadline for the CYA to take administrative actlOn \nI \n20  against employees.  The Nelles audit reflected that grievance documents are frequently \nI \n21  lost, stating \"[t]he absence of a system to ensure accountability, combined WIth evidence \n22  that grievances are in fact lost, raises the specter of possible staff abuse, such as staff \n23  simply throwing away ward grievances.\" \n24  104.  The San Luis Obispo County Grand Jury found that wards at the lockup \n25  unit at El Paso de Robles Youth Correctional Facility \"had no grievance log and no \n26  grievance clerk, and there was little evidence that any wards had initiated written \n27  grievances while there.\"  The Grand Jury found that \"the grievance procedure there has \n28  been emphatically disallowed by those in charge of the system.\"  Wards informed Grand \n29 \n\n1  Jury members that they did not file grievances because they feared retaliation.  The \n2  grievances clerks in other housing units lacked \"adequate knowledge of the grievance \n3  procedure to assure full access by the wards they are selected to serve.\" \n4  105.  An investigation by the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency found that \n5  \"due to inattention over the years and failure to monitor efficacy, the grievance system is \n6  inconsistently applied and ineffective.\"  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance \n7  Project, August 9-11, 2000, and September 6-8, 2000.) \n8  106.  In addition to his failure to provide wards with an adequate grievance \n9  procedure, defendant Harper fails to provide adequate law library access and access to the \n10  courts.  Wards in the CYA are frequently denied access to the law library, or are \n1~  1'   pennitted to use it for an insufficient period of time.  An outside arbitrator has concluded \nI \n12  that \"[ilt seems quite clear that [Northern Youth Correctional Reception Center and \n13  Clinic's] library is not operating properly.\" \n14  G.  Disability Discrimination \n15  107.  Wards in the CYA are discriminated against based on physical, sensory, \n16  developmental, coguitive, mental, and learning disabilities, in violation of Government \n17  Code sections 4450 and 11135 and Education Code sections 56000 et seq.  Wards with \nII   \n18  disabilities are denied access to CYA facilities, programs, services, and activities due to \n19  their disabilities and face harassment and humiliation based on their disabilities.  The \n20  CYA   has failed to develop adequate policies or procedures to ensure equal access to \n21  programs, services, and activities and freedom from disability harassment. \n22  108.  The CYA   admits that it violates the rights of wards with cognitive \n2311 \ndisabilities: \nI \n24  [T)he Department does not operate special programs for individuals with \ncoguitive and intellectual imRairments.  Those that are cognitively or \nintellectually impaired have Clifficulty adjusting to crowded donnitory \nsituations where noise levels are higher and sources of behavioral stimuli \n26  are less controlled.  More socially SKilled and manipulative peers frequently \ntarget them for exploitation.  In the absence of adequate frustration \n27  management and verbal skills, they have a tendency to engage in aggressive \nbehavlOrs, are often considered parole ineligible, and spend longer periods \n28  in detention tllan their more intellectually and socially competent peers. \n30 \n\nEstablishment of behaviorally oriented treatment with a system of rewards \nfor accomplishments and successive approximations can be very effective \n2  in working with intellectually impaired offenders.  Such programs require \nclinical supervision by trained mental health professionals.  At this time, \n3  Intensive Treatment Programs are not staffed or trained to effectively treat \nand manage this populatlOn.  A reduction in program beds with a \n4  corresponilinlS increase in staff/ward ratio will anow Intensive Treatment \nPrograms to ' specialize\" to meet the needs of unserved or underserved \n5  mental health populations such as cognitively/intellectually impaired wards \nand those requiring intensive psychiatric services. \n61 \n(Budget Change Proposal Analysis, Fiscal Year 2002-03.)  The CYA   further admits that \n7 \n\"[ djevelopmentally disabled and cognitively impaired offenders are among those for \n8 \nwhom treatment services are inadequate.\"  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2000-01.) \n9 \n109.  In addition, wards with learning and other cognitive disabilities are not able \n10 \nto participate in counseling groups or programs where the reading material is too difficult \n11 \nI  for them.  The inability to participate in such programs can and often does prevent these \n12 I \nwards from obtaining a higher \"phase\" classification and from making progress towards \n13 \ntheir parole requirements.  The CYA   fails to provide learning disabled wards with the \n14 \nnecessary access to special educational progranuning, thereby impeding their academic \n15 \nprogress and often their chances of parole. \n16 \n110.  The CYA does not have a sufficient number of special education teachers \n17 \nand tutors to assist wards with learning disabilities.  Wards who show signs of learning \nI \n18  I \ndisabilities often are not tested and are refused special assistance from their teachers.  The \n19  I \nYouth and Adult Correctional Agency's investigatory team found in 2000 that the CYA \n~~ \ndoes not meet the statutory requirements for Individual Education Plans: facilities were \nII \nnot completing meaningful IEPs on time, and the resources to implement them were not \n22 \nalways available.  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, August 9-11, \n23 \n2000, and September 6-8,2000.)  The California Department of Education made similar \n24 \nfindings in 2001 with regard to wards held in segregation.  (California Department of \nI \n25 \nEducation Compliance Report # 1-1079-00/01, September 14,2001.) \n26 \nIll.  Wards with physical and sensOlY disabilities, including deaf wards, are not \n27 \nprovided with readily accessible physical facilities and with reasonable modifications \n28 \n31 \n\n'I \n1  necessary to allow them to participate in CYA programs, services, and activities.  Deaf \n2  and hard-of-hearing wards are not provided with equally effective communication and \n3  equal access to ward privileges such as telephone use.  The Youth and Adult Correctional \n'1' \n4  Agency's investigatory team found that \"[ s] taff members who deal with disabled wards \nI \n5  are rmtrained in the requirements of the ADA and appropriate accommodations for those \n6  wards.  Hearing-impaired wards, for example, were not provided a translator for a \n7  significant program activity.  The Team also observed that disabled wards were housed in \n8  other special treatment rmits, with accommodations either missing or provided \n9  inconsistently.\"  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, August 9-11,2000, \n10 i and September 6-8,2000.) \n11  112.  Wards who are disabled due to mental illness also are discriminated against \n12  within the CYA   system.  Through measures such as forced and inappropriate medication, \nI \n13  unnecessary confinement to snicide watches and camera rooms, inadequate therapy, and \n14  I placement on lockup facilities (Special Management Units) due to their mental illness, the \n,- I \nCY A deprives these wards of access to CYA   programs, services, and activities equivalent \n1) \n16  '  to whatis available for non-disabled wards. \n17  H.  Sex Discrimination \n18  113.  Female wards in the CYA are denied equal access to education: far fewer \n19  I college level courses are offered to female wards than to male wards. As a result it takes \n20  I  much longer for female wards to obtain college degrees.  In addition, the Youth and Adult \n21  Correctional Agency found that there is \"a critical lack of vocational education \n22  opportunities for female wards,\" and remarked that they are not equivalent to those \n23  offered male wards.  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, August 9-11, \n24  2000, and September 6-8, 2000.) \n25  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: ILLEGAL ENDANGERMENT TO PHYSICAL \n26  SAFETY OF WARDS \n27  114.  Plaintiffrealleges and incorporates by reference herein all of the allegations \n28  contained in paragraphs 1 through 113, inclusive, as though they were fully set forth \n32 \n\nII \n1  herein. \n2  115.  Defendant uses public funds, in violation of Code of Civil Procedure \n3  section 526a, to confine wards in unlawful conditions that put their physical safety at \n4  umeasonable risk of harm. Defendant's illegal actions, which result in the unlawful \n5  conditions, include, but are not limited to, the following: \n6  (a) the continued acceptance of wards into the CYA when the CYA is unable to \n7  provide for their physical safety, in violation of Welfare and Institution Code § 736 (CYA \n8  shall only accept a ward \"if it has adequate facilities to provide ... care\"); \n9  (b) the illegal use of excessive force against wards (see, for example, paragraphs \n10  12-17 above), in violation of the Califomia Constitution, art. I, §§ 1 (right to enjoy life, \n11  liberty, and safety), 7 (right to due process), and 17 (no cruel or unusual punishment); \n12  Penal Code §§ 147 (willful inhmnanity or oppression toward prisoners), 149 \n13  (unnecessary assaults by peace officers), and 673 (ban on \"cruel, corporal or unusual \n14  punishment\" and the \"il1flict[ion of] any treatment or allow[al1ce of] any lack of care \n15  whatever which would injure or impair the health of the [ward]\"); and Cal. Code of \n16  Regs., tit. 15, §§ 4039 and 4040 (restrictions' on use afforce and chemical and \n17  mechanical restraints); \n18  ( c) the illegal, punitive use of chemical restraints against wards (see, for example, \n19  paragraphs 13-14 and 17 above), in violation of the Califomia Constitution, art. 1, § § 1 \n20  (right to enjoy life, liberty, and safety), 7 (right to due process), and 17 (no cruel or \nI \n21  unusual punishment); Penal Code §§ 147 (willful inhmnanity or oppression toward \n22  prisoners), 149 (ullilecessary assaults by peace officers), and 673 (ban on \"cruel, corporal \n23\\  or unusual punishment\" and the \"il1flict[ion of] any treatment or allow[ance of! any lack \n24 I  of care whatever which would injure or impair the health of the [ward]\"); and Cal.

      "text": "Report of Findings of \nMental Health and Substance Abuse \nTreatment Services \nto Youth in \nCalifornia Youth Authority Facilities \nDecember 2003 \nConsultants: \nEric W. Trupin, PhD. \nRaymond Patterson, M.D. \n\nReport of Findings of \nMental Health and Substance Abuse \nTreatment Services \nto Youth in \nCalifornia Youth Authority Facilities \nDecember 2003 \nConsultants: \nEric W. Trupin, PhD. \nRaymond Patterson, M.D. \n\nStructure of the Consultants' Review & Report \nThis report summarizes the findings of Dr. Eric Trupin and Dr. Raymond Patterson, \nregarding mental health and substance abuse services to youth under the aegis of the \nCalifornia Youth Authority (CY A).  The report also includes our responses to the 22 \nareas of inquiry put forward by the State of California's Attorney General's Office. \nAs part of this review, we had the opportunity to meet with Director Jerry Harper, \nAssistant Deputy Director Kip Lowe, and the Superintendents at each of the facilities (see \nbelow). In addition, we interviewed key administrative, medical, mental health, education \nand custody staff.  We had the opportunity to individually interview 65 youth and review \n90 medical records and 60 juvenile justice files. At each facility we observed and \ninterviewed youth participating in school programs, unit based group programs, treatment \ngroups, vocational programs as well as being \"staffed\" for either regular classification \nreviews or for disciplinary hearings. A component of our site inspection procedure was to \nhave a list provided at each facility of youth identified as having significant mental health \nneeds or on a current suicide level or on psychotropic medications or those who had \nmultiple stays in Special Management Programs or those youth where use of force had \nbeen required on multiple occasions.  We chose from these lists the youth we \nsubsequently interviewed. On a number of occasions youth or staff suggested we \ninterview a particular staff member or youth. \nThis report is based both on our own information, gathered through site inspections, and \non a review of documents provided by the California Youth Authority (CY A), including \nassessments of the CYA's mental health system, reports of the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, the Stanford Report, the Dvoskin and Kosan Report and documents prepared as \na function of a number of pending litigations. \nWe had the opportunity to tour the following facilities: \n1) Northern Youth Correctional Reception Center Clinic \n2) Southern Youth Correctional Reception Center Clinic \n3) Preston \n4) Heman G. Stark \n5) Ventura \n6) Nelles \n7) O.H. Close \n8) Dewitt Nelson \n9) Chadjerian \nThe Karl Holton facility (primarily a facility for youth identified as having significant \nsubstance use and chemical dependency) was not visited; comments related to substance \nabuse and chemical dependency treatment are based on program descriptions and the \nfacilities visited. \n2 \n\nOn our site visits, we were accompanied by either Ms. Anderson or Mr. Acquisto from  . \nthe Attorney General's Office, as well as by Dr. Lowe from CYA  . These three \nindividuals facilitated our access, provided us with contextual and factual information \nand clarified information from requested documents. In no circumstance did they attempt \nto influence \"who or what\" we reviewed, nor did they attempt to bias the findings we are \nsUbmitting. It was our impression that the attorneys representing the Attorney General's \noffice and Dr. Lowe participated in this review in an open and helpful manner and \nappeared to find the process instructive and beneficial to their understanding of the \ncontinued challenges and strengths of the programs provided to youth managed under the \naegis ofCYA. \nFindings in the following report were based on accepted professional standards (also \nincluded in report). These standards have been derived from the clinical, administrative \nand forensic experience of Drs. Patterson and Trupin as well as other experts recognized \nfor their professional expertise in the field of juvenile justice rehabilitation. \nThis report acknowledges that progress has been made to improve services for youth with \nbehavioral health disorders (mental health and substance abuse disorders) during the past \n6 months and over the course of our review.  However, the California Youth Authority \ncontinues to fall short of meeting many recognized standards of care for youth with \nmental health and substance use disorders. \nThe second half of the report is organized to address the areas of inquiry provided by \nyour office, and follows a question/answer format. \n3 \n\nReport of Findings of \nMental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Services \nTo Youth in California Youth Authority Facilities \nDecember 2003 \nThis report summarizes the findings of Dr. Raymond Patterson and Dr. Eric Trupin, in \ntheir review of the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Services to youth \nincarcerated in facilities of the California Youth Authority (CYA), over many visits \nthroughout 2003.  The report begins with accepted standards of service in the field and \nthe related findings in CY A (in italics).  Following that, the questions posed by the State \nAttorney General's office are answered. \nI.  Mental Health Standards for Secure Juvenile Justice Facilities \nThe following standards are derived from Drs. Patterson and Trupin's clinical and \nacademic experience, from current regulatory guidelines, and from the work and \nprofessional recommendations of experts in the fields of mental health and juvenile \njustice, as discussed and documented in the professional literature and in programs across \nthe country.  These are appropriate standards of care for this pop~lation. \nA.  Screening/Initial Assessment \nAll youth entering secure facilities need to be provided a reliable, valid, and confidential \ninitial screening, in a timely manner, to identify emergent suicide risk, psychiatric, \nmedical, substance use, and developmental and learning disorders.  Reliable and valid \ntools developed for juvenile justice popUlations such as the Massachusetts Adolescent \nScreening Inventory (MA YSI II) should be a component of the intake screening \nprocedure. The screening infonnation needs to be summarized and communicated to the \nyouth's case manager so that identified needs are addressed in a timely manner. Family \nor guardian contact is to be initiated in order to provide feedback and elicit infonnation \nrelated to the youth's mental health/health status. \nCYA partially meets this Standard in providing reliable, valid and confidential initial \nscreening ofy outh for past and current mental health and substance use problems, \nincluding current riskfor suicide. However, information is often not communicated to a \nyouth's case manager in a way that would allow the development of a practical \nintervention plan.  In addition, families are rarely contacted either to clarifY diagnostic \nissues or to provide information related to a youth's current status. \nB.  Specialized Mental Health Assessments \nFurther assessment must be completed on any youth whose screeninglinitial assessment \nindicates problems.  Specialized mental health assessments are designed to accurately \n4 \n\ndiagnose mental illness, substance abuse disorders, developmental disabilities and \nlearning disorders.  These assessments consist of structured psychiatric evaluations, \nmental status examinations and standardized cognitive and psychological assessments. \nThese assessments will allow a clinician to both identify and confirm a diagnosis, identify \nthe degree of functional impainnent, and develop a proposed strategy for treatment. \nIn the past 6 months, specialized assessments have been and continue to be added to the \nTNA process.  On a more consistent basis, structured psychiatric interviews (VDISC), as \nwell as personality tests such as the Millon and the MMPI, are administered.  Measures \nofs ociopathic behavior are being implemented.  In addition, specialized assessments for \nsubstance use and sex offenders are provided. \nC.  Treatment Planning \nTreatment planning is the process of identifying a hypothesis as to the reason a youth \nneeds treatment and a plan to intervene in the youth's symptoms and emotional disorders. \nTreatment plans require the setting of specific goals oftreatment in a coherent manner. \nPlans must identify targets for intervention, methods to accomplish those goals and ways \nto measure ifthe treatment is effective.  Specific strategies need to be clearly identified to \naddress, integrate and/or coordinate the approach when common co-existing problems \nsuch as substance abuse and learning disabilities are present. \nDespite the screening, assessment and specialized assessments being done. treatment \nplanning, as described in this Standard, is not evident in the clinical records ofy outh in \nCYA. Treatment planning requires significant improvement. Implementation of the SPAN \nprocess will aid in making decisions regarding the type and intensity ofp rogram a youth \nrequires. however. specific treatment goals employing evidenced-based interventions \nmust be developed as they are, currently, consistently absent. \nD.  Case Management \nCase management entails the coordination and monitoring of all rehabilitative needs \nidentified in the findings of the court, as well as the treatment and educational needs \naccessed through screenings and assessments. Insuring that consistent communication is \nmaintained between clinical, educational and custody staff is a key component of case \nmanagement. Developing transition plans with community providers, community \nparole/probation officers, family or guardians or other placement facilities is also a core \nfunction of case management. \nCase Management Standards were found to be inconsistently applied across facilities \nand in need ofs ignificant improvement. \nE.  Mental Health Counseling \nMental health counseling refers to treatments provided by or under the supervision of \nqualified/licensed mental health personnel.  Use of evidence-based treatments or \"best \npractices'\" and practice parameters are to be emphasized. Clinical treatment effectiveness \n5 \n\nresearch with juvenile offenders strongly supports the use of Cognitive Behavioral \nTreatment (CBT) strategies as the most effective interventions for the majority of \npsychiatric disorders manifested by juvenile justice youth. These treatments are often \nimplemented in conjunction with psychopharmacologicaJ interventions, depending on the \nparticular problem a youth manifests, and his/her functional status. Counseling needs to \nrelate to the targets outlined in an initial treatment plan. The ongoing counseling plan \nneeds to specify how the interventions' effectiveness will be measured. Involvement of \nfamily members and coordination with educational and custodial staff is encouraged. \nTransition plans and termination or completion of treatment summaries are required in \norder to facilitate continuity of care when a youth is being transferred between facilities \nor returning to the community. \nMental Health Counseling Standards were found to be inadequately and inconsistently \nadhered to throughout CYAfacilities visited \nF.  Management of Psychotropic Medications \nManagement of psychotropic medications must be conducted either by a psychiatrist or, \nunder certain defined circumstances, a non-psychiatrist physician or clinical nurse \npractitioner supervised by a child psychiatrist. Treatment must adhere to practice \nparameters as they relate to the specific diagnosed disorder a youth manifests. \nCoordination with other providers and case managers is essential in providing appropriate \ntreatment and consistent monitoring.  For each medication used, a specific targeted \nsymptom needs to be identified. Monitoring plans, designed to assess the effectiveness of \nreducing symptoms, should include case managers, counselors, teachers and, where \nappropriate, custody staff and family members.  Youth participation in treatment must \ninclude assent and education related to the purpose of the medication, a specific manner \nin which a youth can assess the benefits, and potential side effects.  Parental or guardian \nconsent must be obtained, depending on the age of consent regulations of a jurisdiction. \nSpecific plans for prqviding medication on discharge or transfer from a facility needs to \nbe documented. \nInconsistent and substandard practices are evident as it relates to the use ofp sychotropic \nmedication. In a number off acilities, psychiatric evaluations are cursory and do not meet \naccepted professional standards. Psychiatric histories are often not comprehensive and \ndo not include developmental or family information. Prior experience with medication \nand outcomes are often missing. Measurement oft he effect oft he medication on target \nsymptoms is consistently missing and coordination with other mental health professionals \nand case managers is lacking. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in particular is \npoorly managed. A number ofp sychiatrists are reluctant to use stimulant medications \n(due to their concern over illicit use) thus depriving youth ofa n effective treatment for \nthis relatively highfrequency disorder. \nOn a positive note, consenting practices are consistently followed, and information \nrelated to the benefits and risks of medication is regularly provided to youth. \n6 \n\nG. Crisis Management \nCrisis management requires that facilities, in a consistent and well monitored manner, \naddress, assess, develop and implement plans to protect and prevent youth from engaging \nin behaviors which place them or others at risk for harm. \nThe National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) Standards for Juvenile \nDetention Facilities requires that Juvenile detention facilities have a suicide plan that: \n6.  Identifies youth potentially at risk of suicidal behavior \n7.  Reviews the risk of imminent harm to others \n8.  Trains all staff who work with youth to recognize those youth at risk of suicidal \nbehavior \n9.  Assesses youths deemed potential risks by qualified mental health professionals \n10. Monitors youth deemed at risk for suicidal behavior \n11. Houses suicidal youths appropriately (in particular, a prohibition against isolating \nsuch youths) \n12. Refers youth to appropriate mental health providers or facilities \n13. Provides for communication between health care staff and youth care workers on \ncurrent information and status of suicidal youth \n14. Documents steps taken to identify, treat, supervise, house, etc. suicidal youths \n15.  Reviews the risk of previous substance use and tl).e long term consequences of \nabuse on potential self harming behaviors \n16.  Reviews the risk of discontinuation of prescribed medication or non- compliance \nwith appropriately administered psychotropic medications \n17. Notifies facility administrators, outside officials and family members of potential, \nattempted, or completed suicides \n18. Reviews and addresses procedures if a suicide occurs \nIn addition, a facility needs to have policies and procedures for the use of physical and \nchemical restraints, and policies regarding cell restriction and isolation for all youth and \nparticularly those with mental illness and developmental disabilities. \nOur evaluation indicated that the CYAfacilities varied in their compliance with the \nStandard related to Crisis Intervention but, in general, consistently adhered to 1-5 ,12 \nand 13, with more variability infollowing the Standards outlined in 6-11. However, the \nover use ojc hemical restraints continues to be a major concern, particularly when \nadministered to youth who are not presenting a threat to staff or other youth and are \nbeing non -compliant.  Lack ofs kill with verbal de-escalation methods and insufficient \ntraining ofs taff in strategies for the management of non-compliant youth contributes to \nthe inappropriate use ofp unitive strategies, as well as the overuse ofS PA's for \ncontrolling mentally ill youth who engage in aggressive behaviors. \n7 \n\nH.  Youth Development/Treatment Programs \nYouth Development/Treatment Programs refer to the expectation that juvenile facilities \nwill implement an incentive-based and well-defined behavior management program in all \ndomains in which a youth functions. These programs must provide opportunities for \nyouth to learn and practice effective behaviors that promote positive strategies of self \nregulation and pro-social behavior in all aspects of daily living i.e., unit activities, \nrecreation, school, groups, etc. For youth identified as having behavioral health problems, \nbehavior management programs need to be coordinated with a treatment plan and \nevidence ofthis communication must be documented. \nSimple \"level systems\" or \"point systems\" without practice and learning opportunities to \ndevelop the skills for attainment of points are not sufficient. Custodial staff needs to \nimplement \"point\" programs in a consistent and non-punitive manner.  In addition, \njuvenile facilities must provide opportunities for youth with behavioral health disorders \nto participate in educational and vocational programs and to address family conflict, \nsubstance abuse, anger management, gang affiliation, gender and cultural issues. \nAccess for mentally ill youth to Youth Development Programs and Treatment Programs \nis often circumscribed and limited because oft heir frequent stays in Special Management \nPrograms, where the environment is not conducive to youth learning behaviors that \nwould enhance their ability to self regulate their behaviors. Some improvement in access \nto these programs should occur as youth have greater access to CTCs, along with \nexpanded access to both ITPs and STPs. Specific behavioral skill programs based on \nCognitive Behavioral principles need to be consistently implemented, so as to reward \nyouth for incorporating positive skills into their daily behavior in dorms, schools and \nvocational activities. Level and point systems need to be consistently monitored so staff \nare applying the incentives consistently across shifts. Inconsistency in applying incentives \nwas noted across facilities. In addition, mental health staff rarely incorporate treatment \nexpectations into the point and level systems administered on Units, e.g. when a mental \nhealth clinician is working with a youth on dealing with frustration or anger, custody \nstaffs hould be made aware ofs pecific targets for change and reward the youth with \npoints or level advancement for displaying the skills being taught. \n8 \n\nII.  Questions from Attorney Generals' Office and Related Findings \n1. On a system-wide level, is the mental health care provided by the CYA adequate \nand does it conform to community standards? \nResponse: \n•  Overview: The mental health care provided by the CYA   is not adequate and does not \nconform to community standards or to the professional standards identified in this \nreport. Evidence of clinicians utilizing evidence based treatments (Cognitive \nBehavioral Therapies) are rare. Family involvement in treatment interventions is very \nmuch the exception in all facilities visited. Thus, treatment gains made during a secure \nplacement in a CYA   facility are likely to be undermined by the lack of commensurate \nskill development or education in parents/guardians.  This often leads to the youth \nreturning to behaviors which contributed to their offending behavior, once they return \nto their home situation. \nSubstance abuse treatments do not comport with those recommended by the \nAmerican Society of Addictions Medicine (ASAM) and there is little evidence that \nyouth suffering these problems (85% of the CYA population as measured by the \nSteiner report), most of whom have a co-occurring mental health disorder, have \ntreatments designed to treat these disorders in a comprehensive manner, except in one \nprogram (Dewitt Nelson Therapeutic Community Program). Empirically supported. \nMotivational Enhancement strategies are not consistently utilized by clinicians in \nindividual or group activities. Although outcome information was not provided on the \nbenefits ofthe RSAT programs at the Nelson or Nelles facilities, it would be not be \nsurprising if youth enrolled in these more comprehensive programs have lower levels \nof recidivism-even though the programs have limited continuity and transition \nplanning and are only partially utilizing best practices. \nDuring the course of our site visits, we found wide variation in the quality of care and \ntreatment provided to youths receiving mental health services. Much of this variation \nis a consequence of a history of limited central direction of behavioral health care \nservices. Until recently, clinicians (psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers) \nworked as if they were in independent practice. Youth Correctional Counselors \n(YCCs) are not provided with consistent mental health consultation nor do they have \nadequate training in the management of youth with co-occurring disorders. \nTreatment plans are not designed to actively involve YCCs or families. YCCs are \noften left to make decisions on how to manage mentally ill youth without the \nguidance of a specific treatment plan developed by a mental health professional. In \naddition, objective measurements of the effects of psychotropic medications -- via \nregular assessment of how youth are functioning on units, in school, or in vocational \nsettings -- rarely occur. \nClear evidence exists that efforts were underway to centralize and enhance decision \nmaking, implement best practice programs (structured program development in \nCTCs, ITPs, and SCPs), develop strategies to more effectively assign levels of care \n9 \n\n---------_ ----\n..  ..- \n(SPAN) and develop continuous quality indicators (CQI) for psychiatric care (process \nimplemented during July by Dr Templeton).  However, action plans and remedial \nstrategies were not implemented during the course of this review. \nDespite these efforts, variability in the quality of care across sites persists.  A primary \ndeficiency that contributes to this variability is insufficient staffing.  Staffing is \nparticularly inadequate for child and adolescent psychiatrists and child psychologists \nversed in current practice parameters and empirically based treatments, especially \nwith ethnic minority populations experiencing the co-occurring disorders of mental \nillness and substance abuse. Despite the fact that CYA   has 19 fulltime Psychiatrist \npositions with 4 current vacancies, only a few of these positions are filled by \npsychiatrists having any formal training in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and only \n3 are either Board certified or eligible in thIs sub-specialty. None of the psychiatrists \nhave formal training or certification in substance abuse or chemical dependency. It is \ncrucial that CYA   work actively with the child and adolescent psychiatric training \nprograms and clinical psychology programs in the State of California to establish \nformal relationships with faculty and trainees; the recruitment of recently trained \nclinicians will enhance the quality of care provided to youth with both mental illness \nand substance abuse disorders. It is our view that the uncoordinated approach to \npsychiatric care - essentially providing care without an integrated treatment plan or a \nplan that identifies targets which his/her interventions are designed to address -\nundermines the effectiveness of the current. cadre of psychiatrists' clinical care. \nAs CTC, rTP, SCP and SMP programs develop more structured and empirically \ndriven interventions, with greater emphasis on family involvement, additional \npsychologists will be required to provide program direction and supervision. In \nseveral facilities, there are an inadequate number of psychologists. In other facilities \n(e.g. Preston), the numbers appear appropriate but the assignment process does not \ndistribute the workforce in an effective way. In effect, too much time is spent in \nassessment and report writing and not enough time in individual, family or group \ninterventions. Nor is adequate time spent in disposition and transition planning, staff \nconsultation or training.  The staffing concern described by Steiner, Humphreys, and \nRedlich, related to inordinate amounts of time spent by mental health staff doing \npaperwork, continues to be voiced by clinicians. However, it is our assessment that \nmany of the new forms (SPAN and SRSQ) that mental health staff are required to fill \nout will ultimately improve care for youth and are worth the time required. \nLow salaries for psychologists, compared to Department of Corrections' psychologist \nemployees, have a significant effect on recruitment and retention of motivated and \ntalented clinicians. This issue needs to be remedied in order to implement and sustain \nstaff for the progressive programs CYA   is contemplating. \nIn general we have grave concerns relative to the competence of the psychiatric staff, \nhistorical lack ofleadership (which we observed to be in the process of being \nremedied), and the lack of any effective quality management or peer review process \nfor the practice of psychiatry. \n10 \n\nThe programs that have implemented an \"Enhanced Case Management Model\", \nassigning YCCs to be \"off-post\" and in the dayrooms, yards, and other areas to \nprovide services directly to youths, are clearly positively effecting positive outcomes \nfor youth.  This model can be significantly improved upon with the implementation of \nintensive training for YCCs on Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) strategies. \nCBT should be the primary management and skill development procedure for staff \ninteractions and responding to conflicts between youth and staff. A number of states \n(Washington, Missouri, New Hampshire) have significantly reduced use of force, \nyouth on youth, and youth on staff violence through the implementation of these \nprocedures. \n•  Programming:  There are examples of adequate or even exceptional programming, \nsuch as the substance abuse treatment component at Dewitt Nelson (The Karl Horton \nFacility is referenced in the Steiner report as having a beneficial Substance Abuse \nprogram despite their observation that interventions were neither developmentally \nappropriate or empirically driven), and there were youth interviewed who had been in \nseveral other substance abuse programs.  This programming was the exception rather \nthan the rule. \nThe programmatic component of the SMP also varied considerably in that the \ntreatment staff appeared to take a very subservient role to custody staff with regard to \nthe actual purpose of the SMP program.  This inconsistency was also noted by \nSteiner, Humphreys, and Redlich who said, \"That is ... most facilities feel like \ncorrectional facilities with some limited mental health backup\"  Common sense and \ncommunity standards suggest that any reasonable attempts to rehabilitate mentally ill \noffenders would occur in an environment that is secure but more therapeutic than \ncorrectional in structure. SMPs are not currently driven by clear therapeutic \nobjectives. The inflexible number of days a youth is required to stay after placement \nin the SMP undermines and potentiates deviant behavior of the mentally ill youth \nwho are confined in these settings. The core management technique for these units \nshould specify target behaviors to be demonstrated by youth for specified periods of \ntime, earning increased privileges. \nOur site visits confirmed that several SMP programs, such as those at Stark, Chad, \nand Nelles, were very much aligned with a punishment model in that they allowed a \nyouth to be separated from population and housed in one of these areas until they \ndemonstrated they were compliant with rules. Very little emphasis was placed on a \nyouth's skill enhancement or their incorporation of self regulation or distress \ntolerance strategies.  These punitive techniques occurred despite there being clear \nevidence, in several instances, of a youth in considerable emotional distress, with a \nhistory of similar patterns of behavior, and no evidence that this punitive strategy \nbrought about a desired change in a youth's behavior.  The use of the SPAs in these \nprograms, including Nelles, was not therapeutic, and we advised they should be used \nonly for the very shortest periods of time until a youth was more therapeutically \nmanaged. \n11 \n\n----------------- ---\nWe opined early in the review process that the program at Tamarack Lodge at Preston \nshould be closed to any youth in need of mental health services.  Remarkably, the \nfacility response was to place these youths in Ironwood, where they were isolated and \naway from staff observation or interaction, and without adequate staff enhancement to \naddress their mental health needs.  The use of the SPAs and OC spray appear to be \nexcessive and ineffective (some youth have had numerous incidents ofOC spray and \nstays in the SMP, but their disruptive behavior has not changed in frequency and \nintensity). At the facility/administrative level, there does not appear to be any input \neither prior to the use of these restrictive and punitive measures or after their use, to \nattempt to alter or develop any meaningful treatment plans or approaches.  The \nfrequent use of the SMP, SPAs and OC spray as punishment exacerbates symptoms \nof mental illness.  This is especially true among the approximately 65% of CYA   \nyouths who have serious symptoms of mental illness. (Steiner, Humphreys, and \nRedlich,2001). \nThe quality of mental health programs varies widely from facility to facility. \nThe assessment procedure implemented at the Northern Reception, Southern \nReception, and Ventura clinics utilizes the TNA process. This assessment takes \napproximately a month to complete and produce a report identifying treatment needs. \nThe quality ofthese reports is good, however, specific empirically based ?uggested . \nintervention strategies are absent from the recommended treatment suggestions and \nthese reports do not appear to guide treatment direction once a youth is placed in a \nfacility. Youth are provided with a suicide risk questionnaire (SRSQ) within one hour \noftheir arrival. CYA   has recently introduced the use of the SPAN to determine the \nneed for a youth to be placed in a specialized treatment program (ITP, SCP or CTC). \nThis tool has been in place for only a few months and has not been effectively \nevaluated for its accuracy as a method to assign a level of care. However, it appears to \nbe a significant positive advance for using clinical and functional factors in \ndetermining level of program need and acuity. \nThe highest/most acute level of care in the system is in the CTC crisis beds, which are \nin the developmental stage and are currently inadequate to the needs of the CYA   \npopulation.  The initial crisis beds established at Stark are designed in a manner \nsimilar to mental health crisis beds in the adult California Department of Corrections \nfor short stay crisis stabilization (LOS of up to 30 days).  The criteria for admission \nand length of stay for Stark's 13 crisis beds will potentially not lend itself to effective \nutilization due to the potential of many youth being referred because of inadequate \nsystem wide programming and treatment and not having an adequate step down unit \nin which to transition. \nThe proposed Licensed Care Plan calls for 10 dedicated state hospital beds with long \nterm length of stays, 33 CTC beds (13 in place at Stark) and 20 Intermediate Care \nbeds in conjunction with the Division of Mental Health (LOS 30 - 180 days) \n12 \n\nThe agreement with Metropolitan State Hospital to provide hospital level services to \nyouths 18 years of age and over appears to be appropriate for the small number of \nyouths referred, however, the hospital's services were stated to be substandard and \noften not helpful for CYA youth, by a number of mental health professionals. \nCurrently CYA   has no crisis beds for females. Although CYA   has contracts with \nvarious hospitals for all aged youth, these emergent services are often difficult to \naccess without significant negotiation with admitting medical staff and youth are \noften returned without a viable treatment plan because of the difficult management \nproblems they present. The need for external hospital utilization for younger youth \nshould be mitigated with the addition of the additional CTC beds and the \nimplementation of structured programs in the other specialized units as well as more \neffective empirically based clinical services offered system wide. \nThe next level of care, the Intensive Treatment Programs (ITPs), also varies markedly \nacross CY A.  The Department has developed 207 ITP beds system-wide, however \nmany of these \"sub-acute crisis beds\" are not being used appropriately and youth \nspend inordinate amounts of time on \"camera watch\". The overuse of camera \nobservation places vulnerable youth at risk for self harm due to less than effective \nfields of view for these cameras (this issue particularly pertinent at Nelles.) \nThe Specialized Counseling Program (SCP) demonstrated similar variability.  In the \nSCP at Oak Lodge, for example, the psychiatrist never met with the staff; therefore, \nthere were no discussions as to the overall treatment needs ofthe youth.  This, again, \nreflects the lack of treatment planning at all levels of care. \nThose youths in the general popUlation who are receiving mental health services \nreceive the least attention, and had the most inadequate staffing and programming \nacross the system. \n•  Assignment oflevels of care:  As noted above, the levels of care are assigned at the \nReception Centers.  Therefore, a youth who does not get assigned an appropriate level \nand is in subsequent need of a higher level of care, needs to come to the attention of \nmental health staff based on either acting out, self or staff referral, or through the \ndisciplinary process. Mental health and custodial staff sometimes do \"case finding\" \nbut it is a relatively low frequency event. This method of identifying youths in need is \ninadequate and does not provide for prompt and appropriate mental health care. \n•  Credentials and Competence: In meeting with the psychiatrists working in all CYA   \nfacilities visited, it appears they operate on a \"private practice\" model in which each \nhas his/her own ideas and opinions as to treatment modalities.  The psychiatrists are \noften only marginally members of the mental health treatment team.  Post-hoc reviews \nof clinical practice by the CYA   medical director do not seem to occur regularly, as \nwas recommended by Koson and Dvoskin . For example, the use of stimulants for the \ntreatment of attention deficitihyperactivity disorder varies from being used when \nindicated to never being used, as a matter of professional opinion and/or historical \npractice.  Koson and Dvoskin recommended that the CYA   medical director review this \n13 \n\nissue of stimulants, however, there is no evidence that there is any change in clinical \npractice.  Similarly, youths that have had persistent disciplinary infractions or \nadjustment problems mayor may not be seen by a psychiatrist, depending on facility \nand the psychiatrist's particular preference. Multiple referrals around disciplinary \nissues should by policy elicit a mental health referral. \n•  Excessive disciplinary responses without meaningful mental health input:  In \nreviewing the disciplinary process, particularly the SMPs and those instances where a \ncustody response is generated, such as cell extractions, mental health input varies from \nnon-existent to non-impacting.  We observed youths that were in clear distress and, in \na few cases, mental health staff who recognized this distress attempting to address the \nyouth's issues, only to have the custody response be based on ineffective punitive \napproaches which only altered the youth's non-compliant behavior temporarily and \ndid not reduce the likelihood of a re-occurrence. The observed procedures included the \nassignment of lengthy SMP stays, restrictive housing, andlor use of OC spray \nregardless of the youth's mental status. \n•  Poor medication assessments and direct observation therapy:  There is no consistency \nin the system with regard to medication management.  As noted above, much of the \nmedication management depends on the individual psychiatrist's approach, and is \nwithout meaningful peer review or oversight.  These inconsistencies seem to violate \nCYA policy regarding direct observation therapy for psychotropic medications.  There \nwere a number of instances of \"poly-pharmacy\", with youths receiving from 3-8 \ndifferent psychotropic medications without adequate justification in the record.  We \nalso observed that HS or nighttime medications were not available in some facilities, \nincluding CHAD, because of what was reported as inadequate staffing due to nursing \nvacancies.  Not having nighttime medications available to mentally ill youth is \nespecially egregious because needy youth are deprived appropriate care.  In addition \nthese youth metabolize medication on average at a faster rate than adults thus \nexacerbating the potential for the benefits oft he medications to be mitigated \npromoting deteriorations in mental status. \n2.  Are the eVA's mental health care policies and procedures adequate? \nResponse:  The policies and procedures are in the process of being developed.  As \nrecently as 7124/03, we received procedures for the Specialized Behavioral Treatment \nProgram at the Sequoia Lodge at Preston.  The policies and procedures, again, need to \nbe reviewed and revised with a focus on their consistency, and the identified purpose \nof the mental health programs.  The staff to youth ratios in these programs need to be \nincreased.  The procedures for peer review, quality assurance, quality audits, and \nquality management have not yet been developed to adequately assess the \ncompetence, practice, and quality of services provided. Both the Koson and Dvoskin \nand the Steiner reports made many suggestions related to policies and procedures that \nhave not been implemented. Most importantly, procedures need to be developed for \nan integrated model of mental health interventions for both individual and group \n14 \n\ntreatment and milieu management that rely on empirically based best practice \napproaches emphasizing cognitive behavioral practices. \n3. Has the CYA implemented appropriate mental health quality assurance \nprocedures? \nResponse:  These procedures have not been implemented, as noted above.  During the \ncourse of our site visits, the medical director and chief psychiatrist had directed the \nCMOs to review psychiatric practice.  This review, again, appeared to vary widely as \nseveral of the CMOs, despite the best intentions, reported they did not feel they had \nthe competence to review psychiatric practice adequately.  Peer review needs to be \ninstituted to assess the treatment modalities utilized by psychiatrists, including \nmedication management.  The Unified Health Records (UHR) reflect very poor \ndocumentation, and there is no adequate process in place to review the \ndocumentation .. \nThe suicide prevention program although improved continues to need system wide \nimplementation. There have been efforts by CYA   to develop standards for suicide \nassessment, suicide watch, and post-suicide managment.  The post-suicide \nmanagement process has not yet been effectively instituted but is in the process of \nimplementation across instituitions. \nLastly, the need for rapid implementation of additional CTC  level care for male and \nfemale youths remains critical. With the implementation of these beds and those \nIntermediate Care beds being developed in conjunction with the Division of Mental \nHealth, CYA   will become less dependent on various public (Patton and Metropolitan) \nand private hospitals who are often challenged by the combination of \npsychopathology and  and criminal behavior CY A youth manifest. Appropriate \ncontinuity of care and treatment planning will be better sustained with a model of care \nderived by an integrated CY A treatment model that can be managed and supervised \ninternally by the CYA   clinincians and juvenile justice staff. \n4.  Does the CYA have a sufficient number of psychiatrists, psychologists and other \nhealth care professionals to provide an adequate level of mental health care \nservices? \nResponse:  As stated above, we believe the CYA   does not have an adequate number \nof psychiatrists, and there are questions regarding the competence of several of the \npsychiatrists currently providing care to youth. While the Steiner Report and past \nconsultants have recommended increasing the number of psychologists, in our view \nthere is a particular need for an increase in psychologists at facilities that have only \npart-time coverage.  However, in some of the larger facilities, the issue is one of \ndistribution and supervision of psychologists rather than actual numbers.  There \nappear to be insufficient numbers of youth correctional counselors (YCCs) to provide \nthe Enhanced Treatment Model that appears to be effective in programs where it is \ncurrently implemented.  The number of caseworkers appears to be adequate. \n15 \n\n------~-~-~~~ ~--. \n5.  On a system-wide level, does the CYA   appear to have a sufficient number of \nancillary personnel, including officers, to appropriately care for youths? \nResponse:  There appear to be an inadequate number of ancillary personnel, \nspecifically officers, to escort youths to areas within facilities that can be used for \ntherapeutic programming; the design of several of the older facilities does not allow \nfor sound privacy in treatment areas, or adequate areas in the living units, so escorts \nto other locations within the facility are necessary. With increased development of \nstructured pro grams and an integrated treatment model, where all staff utilize \ncognitive behavioral approaches, officers' roles could be modified to involve them \nmore consistently in rehabilitative activities. There is an inadequate number of nurses \nto assure direct observation therapy, however, whether this is an allocation or vacancy \nissue is unclear.  There is also a lack of pharmacists at several facilities, so that an \neffective medication management program cannot be achieved. \n6. On a system-wide level, are the CYA's mental health care clinicians \nappropriately trained, supervised and disciplined? \nResponse:  The training is variable across the system.  It appears that while training \nhas been documented, the implementation of the training at the facility level has not \nbeen demonstrated.  There is a lack of supervisors; only recently was the chief \npsychiatrist given authofity over hiring and appointment of psychiatrists system-wide. \nFacility level supervision and regional supervision for a number of facilities has been \nassigned to Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) without adequate demonstration of skill \nto effectively provide competent supervision.  At smaller facilities, such as OH Close \nand Dewitt Nelson, part-time psychiatric coverage appears to be ineffective, and \nsupervision absent.  With regard to disciplinary actions involving mental health \nclinicians, we were not provided any information to suggest that disciplinary actions \nhave taken place.  With regard to disciplinary actions for custody staff, there is some \nevidence that individual custody staff behavior is being addressed with greater \nregularity, but staff and officer misbehavior continues to be a source of significant \nconcern for a number of mental health professionals as well as many youth. Access to \ntraining opportunities for all mental health professionals is limited and clearly effects \nmorale and limits the implementation of effective and efficient (costs) best practice \napproaches. \n7.  Does the CYA appropriately screen incoming youths for mental health \ntreatment needs? \nResponse:  See Response in Section LA. of the Mental Health Standards, addressing \nScreening!A  ssessment (earlier in this report) \n8.  On a system-wide level, are the CYA's mental health care records legible, \nproperly organized, and do they contain adequate information? \n16 \n\nResponse:  The records are not consistently legible, they are not well organized, and \nmay not include basic information regarding a youth's care. The charts often lack \ntreatment plans, and organized progress notes in a SOAP or other recognized format. \nThe CYA has a remarkable practice of having doctors write their orders on progress \nnotes, rather than on doctor's order sheets, which is the community and correctional \nstandard in every facility we have ever seen.  This practice lends itself to medication \nerrors (which are not measured in any meaningful way), and a lack of integration of \ntreatment.  The system is moving in the direction of having \"individual change plans\" \ninstead of treatment plans, however, this effort has only recently begun. Important \ninformation, useful to YCCs and case workers, is often not shared due to perceived \nconfidentiality issues .Individual Change Plans are not filed in the UHR so they \ncannot be properly accessed by medical and psychiatric staff. \n9.  On a system-wide level does the CYA provide adequate mental health care to its \ngeneral population? \nResponse:  No, the CY A does not provide adequate treatment to its general \npopUlation.  There are several deficiencies in this area including access to care, \ndistribution of staff, inadequate staff to patient ratios, and a triage and crisis driven \nprocess.  Once an inmate has gotten through the screening process, they may not be \nseen by mental health staff again unless they have some form of crisis, which is \ninadequate. The vast majority of youths who have mental health needs are made \nworse instead of improved by the correctional environment. \n10. Are the CYA suicide watch policies and procedures adequate, and, if so, are they \nproperly implemented? \nResponse:  The policies and procedures have been developed during the course of our \nsite visits, and now include an aftercare (after suicide watch) component.  However, \nthe custody YCCNCO follow-up has not yet been measured to determine its \nadequacy.  Implementation of the policies is just beginning with a central monitoring \nfocus in the developmental stages. \nDuring the course of our tours, there was a completed suicide of a 16-year old youth \nat NYCRCC.  This youth had been in the clinic for two weeks, and had been assessed \nas a high risk for suicide. A comprehensive \"Operational Analysis\" was conducted \nsubsequent to the suicide which identified the need for a policy regarding post release \nfrom suicide watch follow-up plans. This procedure was developed and, as noted \nabove, is in the process of implementation during our tours. CY A is currently \neffectively designing appropriate policies and procedures to address the issue of \nsuicide. What remains to be addressed are the implementation and consistent \nmonitoring, supervision and quality assurance that will sustain the policy in practice \nat a high level of performance compliance.  Suicide prevention committees have been \ndeveloped that coordinate suicide prevention efforts, reviews completed suicides and \nsuicide attempts. \n17 \n\n11.  On a system-wide level, is the CYA's use of physical restraints such as restraint \nchairs and spit masks, appropriate? \nResponse:  This item is very difficult to track because the system does not break out \nmentally ill inmates or inmates on the mental health caseload, and does not aggregate \nresults.  There is a task force that has begun to review the services a youth may have \nbeen receiving and whether or not there was the use of any physical restraints for that \nyouth, as well as individual custody staff performance in those instances where \nphysical restraints have been used. Despite CYA   having a seclusion and restraint \npolicy, the policy does not distinguish procedures for the use of force with youth \nexhibiting mental illness-this needs to be done. The policy should ensure that \nphysical restraints be used as a safety measure and not as punishment. Community \nstandards dictate that this policy should include 1) what measures must be tried prior \nto physical restraint, 2) what specific behaviors necessitate physical restraint, 3) mles \nregarding direct observation of youths when he or she is being physically restrained, \n4) documentation and reporting mles regarding use of physical restraints, 5) specific \nbehavioral criteria that will lead to the removal of physical restraint. \n12. On a system-wide level, are the CYA's mental health care physical facilities \nadequate? \nResponse:  Again, this is an area with considerable va~iability. There are older \nfacilities such as Preston and Nelles that do not have adequate programming space. \nThe newer facilities, such as Chad, appear to have adequate programming space.  We \nhave opined the Tamarack Lodge at Preston should not be used for youth with mental \nhealth issues, and the facility's response to use the Ironwood Lodge requires further \ndevelopment of procedures and staffing enhancements to actually address the needs \nof youths.  The use ofthe SPAs (cages) for both mental health therapies and \neducational purposes does not adequately address the needs of the youths.  While \nKoson and Dvoskin reported that administrators acted quickly on many of their \nrequests to improve mental health care physical facilities, it is unclear if all facilities \nhave implemented all of their site specific recommendations.  Areas of continued \nconcern observed on our visits are: safety issues in video cells,  poor utility of video \nobservation systems, undersized observation panels in cells, dangerous restraining \nbeds, inadequate lighting and, of course, cages as holding cells \n13. On a system-wide level, does the CYA have a sufficient number of beds for its \nmental health treatment programs? \nResponse:  Again, there is variability for the CTCs when they all become operational, \nand with a projection of 0.2-0.3% of the mental health caseload requiring a crisis bed \nat any given time, the numbers appear to be adequate.  However, there are age factors \nthat may interfere with the availability of beds for youths.  The ITPs and SCPs have \nwaiting lists for youths to get into those programs.  The SMPs appear to have an \n\"identity crisis\" and do not yet seem to focus on the therapeutic assessment and \ninterventions that may assist youths in reducing the disciplinary infractions they \n18 \n\nreceive due to disruptive or other objectionable behavior.  Instead, the SMPs are \ncurrently focused on managing youths through a more restrictive environment \ngoverned by time constraints rather than therapeutic responses. \nThe substance abuse beds are not adequate for the system.  We have commented that \nthe intensive substance abuse treatment program at Dewitt Nelson appears to be the \nmost functional, largely because of a very hands-on approach to the youths and a \nprogram that focuses on the \"total person\" rather than simply the substance use and \nabuse. \nIn the general population, the dormitory areas appear to exacerbate mental health \nconcerns to the youths interviewed.  Youths informed us that Nelles is referred to as \n\"gladiator school\", that in Stark the gang problem with \"southerners\" is dramatic, and \nat Chad there are efforts at segregation and isolation of \"northerners\" and \"bulldogs\" \nthat interfere with the appropriate implementation of treatment programs.  Overall, \nthere are an insufficient number of beds for substance abuse programs in the CY A. \nAccording to Koson and Dvoskin and Steiner, Humphreys, and Redlich, there seems \nto be a sufficient number of ITP beds: this obviously has changed, as evidenced by \nthe waiting list.  Both of those reports agree that there is a shortage of SCP beds, but \ndisagree on the magnitUde of the shortage (75 vs. 800). We agree with the lower \nfigure provided by Koson and Dvoskin, as long as the whole system moves in the \ndirection of providing an integrated treatment approach to all youth based on \ncognitive behavioral principles.  Koson and Dvoskin indicate that there is a sufficient \nnumber of substance abuse beds, but they infer that the quality of some of these \nprograms is inconsistent and in some cases suspect.  We disagree and it is our \nrecommendation that substance abuse treatment be expanded to the many youth who \nare merely receiving inadequate educational programs in the general popUlation. \n14. On a system-wide level, does the eYA properly prescribe, administer, and \ndistribute psychotropic medication, including during periods of extreme heat? \nResponse:  No, the CYA does not demonstrate through its records the proper \nprescription administration or distribution of psychotropic medications.  There is no \nevidence of peer review, drug utilization reviews, or record reviews to demonstrate \nadequacy in such activities.  Reviews ofthe records consistently demonstrate poor \ndocumentation of medication practices, great variability ofthe use of stimulants for \nthe treatments of ADHD and other disorders, and no evidence of quality review \nregarding medication management.  Steiner, Humphreys, and Redlich  commented \nthat due to the lack of psychiatrists with specialized training in child psychiatry and \npharmacology, modem psychopharmacology was usually not practiced within the \nCYA  .  They went on to remark that anti -depressants and anti-psychotics were most \noften prescribed, and that stimulants, sedatives, anti-anxiety, and anti-manic \nmedications were rarely prescribed.  We concur with this finding and a remedy needs \nto be implemented. \n19 \n\nDespite the fact that Koson and Dvoskin recommended the drafting of a \"heat plan,\" \nthere was no organizational heat plan provided that addressed the use of psychotropic \nmedications during periods of extreme heat, the use and management of youths' use \nof psychotropic medications, or management of youths during periods of extreme \nheat. \n15. Do the CYA's policies and procedures contained in Institutions & Camps \nManual Sections 6282-84 set forth an appropriate procedure for the involuntary \nor forcible medication of youths with psychotropic drugs? \nResponse:  Yes, the CY A policies and procedures are using the Keyhea process for \nyouths who are 18 or over.  Parental consent or court ordered medications are the \nprocess for youths under the age of 18.  Koson and Dvoskin praised the policy of \nusing psychotherapy alone for youths who did not meet Keyhea Criteria, and for \nwhom parental consent for medication administration could not be gathered. \n16. Does the CYA offer adequate rehabilitation programs including substance abuse \nprogram? \nResponse:  No, the CYA   does not offer adequate rehabilitation or substance abuse \nprograms.  There are \"bright spots\" in the system including the substance abuse \nprogram at Dewitt Nelson; however, the need for more intensive substance abuse \nprograms with a similar treatment model in other facilities is well known to CY A and\" \nneeds immediate implementation.  Further, the outpatient programs are \"informal\" \nand there is a substantial waiting list for youths to be admitted to the intensive \nsubstance abuse programs.  Koson and Dvoskin noted that these informal programs \nare \"apparently run by YCCs with little specific training and supervision.\"  Given \nSteiner, Humphreys, and Redlich's finding that 85% ofCYA youths have substance \nuse issues, it seems unacceptable that more formal substance use intervention \nprograms are not available for youths in the general population. There are also \nconsiderable concerns relative to the lack of vocational rehabilitation programs (even \nin facilities that appear to have physical plants that support such interventions such as \nStark), and the great lack of family involvement in the treatment process.  This lack \nof involvement not only applies to those facilities that are more remote and difficult \nto reach for family members, but also for those that are located very near to or in \nmetropolitan areas.  A plan or program for development to provide transportation to \nthe families of youths should be instituted. \n17. Are the rehabilitative programs generally available to youths who have been \nordered to participate in them by the parole board? \nResponse:  No, these programs are not available to youths who have been ordered to \nparticipate by the parole board because of inadequate number of programs and \ninadequate staffs.  There are waiting lists to get into paroleboard ordered programs. \nSubstance abuse beds were occupied at a rate of 100%.  Given the large number of \nyouths with substance abuse problems, it is likely that those youths may have to wait \n20 \n\nto get into parole board ordered substance abuse programs and end up with longer \nstays in CYA   facilities, due to their inability to access these services. \n18. Are the CYA's rehabilitative programs, including substance abuse programs, \neffective? \nResponse:  At this time, it is unclear as to whether these programs are effective;  there \nis no evidence that the programs are effective, and it is also unclear how many of the \nprograms are based on models that have been effective in other settings.  In \ninterviews with youth who have participated in such programs (particularly substance \nabuse programs) and who subsequently violated parole or re-offended by using \nsubstances or by attempting to obtain funds to buy substances, these youth provided \ntheir impressions that the programs are not effective. Once again, the exception was \nat Dewitt Nelson and their intensive substance abuse program. \n19. On a system-wide level, are the staff who provide rehabilitative programs, \nincluding substance abuse programs, qualified and properly trained? \nResponse:  It is unclear as to whether or not the staff is properly trained on a system \nwide basis.  In specific instances, staff appears to be properly trained and supervised; \nhowever, in other facilities it is not at all clear that the staff have had appropriate \ntraining.  There is a weakness in substance abuse programs relative to their \nintegration with mental health treatment programs.  Youths who may be duly \ndiagnosed with a mental illness and a substance abuse problem do not have an \nintegrated treatment plan that broaches all oftheir needs. Again, Koson and Dvoskin \nnoted that the CYA  's substance abuse treatment beds \"are apparently run by YCCs \nwith little specific training and supervision.\" Our review and assessment supported \ntheir observations.  Without a substance abuse treatment model that is adapted by all \nCYA   facilities, it is likely that training and supervision of substance abuse treatment \nproviders will vary from facility to facility and reduce the likelihood that effective \nrehabilitation will occur for effected youth. \n20. Do the rehabilitative programs, including substance abuse programs, meet \nregularly and are youths able to attend? \nResponse:  This is, again, a facility specific issue.  Where the programs exist, yes, the \nyouths are able to attend, except when staff are on leave.  However, there are not \nenough programs and, other than the program at Dewitt Nelson, there does not appear \nto be an integrated focus on the development of skills regarding life issues for the \nyouths rather than just their drug abuse. \n21. On a system-wide level, are the rehabilitative programs in restricted housing \nunits adequate? \nResponse:  In the SMPs, no.  The substance abuse programs are not adequate, and, in \nprograms such as STP at Preston, the program is not adequate because of an inability \n21 \n\nto retain staff - for a variety of reasons, including the staffs perception they are not \nsafe. \nMedication administration to youths in restricted housing units continues to be a \nmajor concern, according to Koson and Dvoskin, and we agree.  First, policies should \nbe implemented around the direct observation of medication administration, given the \nhigh risk for suicide among youths in SMPs.  Medication provided to youths who are \ncuffed and kneeling continues to be a dangerous practice.  Finally, practices such as \n23 hours of seclusion and liberal use of shackles and cuffs that occurs in restrictive \nhousing units, serve to exacerbate, not rehabilitate youths' mental health problems. \n22. Does the CY A have enough staff to provide an adequate level of rehabilitative \nprogramming, including its substance abuse programming? \nResponse:  No, there are not adequate numbers of staff to provide the intensive \nsubstance programs that are necessary for the youths who are identified with \nsignificant substance abuse problems.  The waiting lists for these programs continue. \nWe concur with Koson and Dvoskin that the number of staff isn't necessarily the \nproblem; rather it is the quality of the staffs training and supervision that is most \ntroublesome.  If those providing treatment and supervision of treatment are not \nproperly skilled in evidence-based substance abuse treatment, increasing staffing may \nnot increase the quality of substance abuse programs in CY A. \n22 ",

Harper, which included medical issues, the \nCalifornia Youth Authority (CY A) in collaboration with the State of California Attorney \nGeneral's Office retained the authors of this document, Dr. Michael Puisis and Ms. \nMadie LaMarre, Nurse Practitioner, as medical experts to evaluate medical care provided \nto wards in the CYA  . \nScope \nWe were asked by Deputy Attorney General Stephen Acquisto to address the following \neight questions: \n1.  Does the CYA   have an appropriate number of medical and dental \nprofessionals? \n2.  Is the CYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \n3.  Are the CYA's medical and dental records appropriate? \n4.  Does the CY A adequately screen incoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \n5.  Do wards have appropriate access to timely medical and dental care of an \nappropriate quality? \n6.  Does the CYA respond appropriately to medical and dental emergencies? \n7.  Does the CYA have appropriate quality control procedures, and have those \nprocedures been appropriately implemented? \n8.  Are wards receiving medical and dental care that is commensurate with \ncommunity standards? \nMethods \nTo evaluate these questions, we met with staff from CYA   Headquarters, reviewed \nmUltiple documents as listed in appendix A, and conducted site visits at seven of eleven \nCYA   facilities. Each site visit generally consisted of the following activities: \n•  Tours of the medical unit, Outpatient Housing Unit (OHU), selected \ndormitories and lockdown areas \n•  Interviews with medical, nursing, dental, correctional staff, and wards \n•  Review of tracking logs and patient medical records \n•  Observation of selected health services such as medical reception, sick call, \nand medication administration \n•  Review of documents, including policies and procedures, and treatment \nmanuals \n•  Review of staffing patterns and professional licensure \nTo establish a benchmark against which to measure care in the CYA  , we used national or \nconsensus standards including: \n1112012003  Page 4 \n\nIntroduction \n•  \"National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) Standards for \nHealth Services in Juvenile Detention and Confinement Facilities,\" Second \nEdition, 1999.

As we toured the sites and developed our report, all staff of the CYA and the \nAttorney General's Office has been c~urteous, helpful and cooperative.  We encountered \nmany excellent staff during our tours, which appeared dedicated to delivering a high level \nof medical services to the wards in the CYA  .  It is our hope that this report will assist \nthem in development of an improved program of medical care.  This summary provides \nan overview of our report and gives general recommendations that are a synopsis of more \nspecific recommendations in the report. \nA primary finding of our review is that medical care provided to wards in the CYA   is not \ncommensurate with community standards of care.  However, the deficiencies are mostly \norganizational and procedural and not primarily financial and therefore are mostly \ncorrectable within the existing budget.  -\nAdditionally, adolescents are generally a healthy population.  Their health care needs are \nmainly preventive in nature.  Therefore, given the low prevalence of wards with chronic \nillness within the CYA  , it will be easier to manage those wards that do have chronic \nillness.  However, the preventive health needs of the wards in the CYA are not being \naddressed.  There is a virtual absence of a preventive health counseling and health \npromotion program.  This should be addressed. \nIt is our opinion that the most important task for the CYA  , relating to medical care is to \ndevelop administrative and medical leadership.  This cannot be done without a \ncommitment by the CYA   Director to support appropriate medical care for wards.  This \ncommitment will ensure the cooperation of the security staff in its interactions with \nmedical staff as they perform their jobs.  Without medical autonomy, appropriate medical \ncare cannot be delivered. \nThe CYA   lacks administrative and medical leadership and supervision.  In part, the lack \nof supervision results from the diffuse administrative structure of medical services.  It is \nour opinion; therefore, that medical services should be brought under centralized \nsupervision with a single Medical Director.  It is also our opinion that the CYA   should \ninstitute centralized administrative leadership by appointing a Statewide Administrator. \nThis position would be responsible for the administrative functions of the medical \nservIces. \nA statewide Administrator and Medical Director partnered with a state Director of \nNursing could form the leadership team to manage the health care program for the CYA. \nThis team's first priority should be the establishment of standardized policies, \nprocedures, and a chronic illness program.  Establishment of a budget should create fiscal \naccountability specific to health care.  Productivity of staff should be evaluated. \nAppropriate inventory control should be established, especially for pharmacy.  In the case \nof pharmacy, contracting out this service should be considered. \n1112012003  Page 6 \n\nIntroduction \nOngoing supervision of clinical staff must be initiated by institution of a Continuous \nQuality Improvement program along with peer review of physicians and routine audits of \nthe process of care.  Critical peer review is essential to ensure that the clinical program is \ncommensurate with community standards and is delivered in a decent and humane \nmanner.  Development of the clinical staff by training is an important adjunct to this \nprocess and should be initiated. \nWe have not reviewed every facility, but have reviewed a significant sample of facilities \nand feel confident that our report is representative of care as provided in the CYA  .  Our \nreport is sufficiently detailed and provides specific recommendations that can be useful as \nprogrammatic goals.  We are hopeful that this report serves to improve health care for the \nwards in the CYA, and will become the basis for instituting necessary changes in the \nexisting program. \n1112012003  Page 7 \n\nIntroduction \n1112012003  Page 8 \n\n1. Does the eYA have an appropriate number of medical and dental professionals? \n1. Does the eYA have an appropriate number \nof medical and dental professionals? \nConclusion: \nAs a whole, the CYA has appropriate numbers of health care professionals to provide \nadequate health care to wards.  However, in some instances staff is unevenly distributed. \nIt may be necessary to reallocate staff between facilities to create the right mix of staff. \nDespite adequate numbers of health care professionals, there are institutional policies \nandlor practices that decrease staff efficiency and productivity, and affect ward access to \nhealth care. \nFindings and Discussion: \nAccording to National Commission on Correctional Health Care Standards for Health \nServices in Juvenile Detention and Confinement Facilities (Standard Y -26), the numbers \nand types of health care professionals required at a facility depend upon the following: \n•  Size ofthe facility \n•  Type of services delivered - medical, nursing, pharmacy, dental, or mental \nhealth \n•  Scope of services delivered - outpatient, inpatient, or specialty care \n•  The needs of the juvenile population \n•  The organization structure (hours of service, scheduling) \nThe CYA   employs full-time physicians and dentists; and full to part-time pharmacists, x \nray, and laboratory technicians. The adequacy of staffing for each position is described in \nthe following information. \nPhysician Staffing \nOf the seven facilities visited, each had a Chief Medical Officer (CMO), and in most \ncases, a staff physician. However, staffing patterns vary without a clear rationale. At the \nNorthern California Youth Correctional Center (NCYCC), the CMO is administratively \nresponsible for 4 facilities, with 3 staff physician allocated to the 4 facilities. Three \nphysicians and a nurse practitioner are employed at Herman G. Stark Youth Correctional \nFacility. One physician is allocated to Preston YCF. The aggregate ratio of physicians to \nwards at the seven facilities surveyed is 1 to 262. This is more than adequate staffing for \na population of this size and medical acuity.  The CYA   should address the allocation of \nphysician resources.  CMOs should provide some direct patient care.  This is not done at \nall facilities, and thereby reduces the availability of physicians. \n1112012003  Page 9 \n\n1. Does the eYA have an appropriate number of medical and dental professionals? \nAside from the numbers of CYA   physicians, a more important issue is the mismatch \nbetween health needs of the wards and training of the CYA physicians. We reviewed 15 \ncredential files of non-psychiatrists practicing in the CYA. Only six were Board Certified \nin a field acceptable for primary care in the CYA   (Pediatrics, Medicine, or Family \nPractice). The skill level of other physicians relative to the needs of the wards is \nquestionable.  Based on chart reviews, those physicians with only internships or with \ntraining in surgical specialties lacked knowledge in appropriate treatment of medical \nconditions (asthma; diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disease, etc.). \nDespite adequate numbers of physicians, there are practices that result in low \nproductivity and reduced access to wards. For example, although we found no policy \ndescribing this practice, full-time physicians work 32-hours/week versus a 40 hour/week, \nbecause they are credited 8 hours for providing on-call services after hours. In addition, \none physician reported that he can be present at the facility (Northern Youth Correctional \nReception Center) for one hour per day, but is paid for 8 hours. \nAt the NCYCC, the CMO has a full-time private medical practice in addition to full time \nemployment with the CYA. This raises the question of how much of the physicians' time \nis actually devoted to the CYA  . Staff reported that if a physician at the NCYCC returns to \nthe facility after normal business hours or holidays, the physician is granted 4 hours \ncompensatory time off (CTO) even if the physician is on-site for only one hour. Staff also \nreported that one physician was off approximately 3 months per year as a result of \naccrued leave time (annual and sick leave and CTO). Therefore, although adequate \nnumbers of physicians are employed, it appears that the CYA   does not receive the full \nbenefit of these positions. \nNursing Staffing \nWith the exception of the Northern California Youth Correctional Center (NCYCC) that \nprovides 16 hour, 7 -day per week nursing coverage, staffing patterns of CYA facilities \nprovide 24 hour, 7 -day per week coverage. A Supervising Nurse (SN) is employed at \neach facility. In addition registered nurses (RNs), licensed vocational nurses (L VNs) and \nmedical technician assistants (MTA  s) are also employed. \nThe number of nursing staff required at each facility depends, in part, on the mechanisms \nof service delivery. For example, if sick call or medication administration services are \ncentralized in the main medical unit, fewer nurses are required. If services are \ndecentralized, requiring the nurses to go to the housing units, then more staff is required \nbecause these services must be delivered within narrow time frames. \nCYA   policies and practices regarding delivery of these services are not standardized from \nfacility to facility. At the Northern YCRCC and EL Paso de Roblas YCF, wards come to \nthe main medical clinic to receive medications. At Ventura YCP, and Herman G. Stark \nYCP, the nurses go to the housing units. At N.A. Chaderjian YCF, the majority of \nmedications (except psycho tropics and narcotics) are delivered by the Correctional Youth \nCounselors (YCCs). \n1112012003  Page 10 \n\n1. Does the eYA have an appropriate number of medical and dental professionals? \nPrimary care (sick call) is delivered by nursing staff in the housing units except at \nHennan G. Stark where the physicians and nurse practitioner conduct sick call, and at El \nPaso de Roblas YCF where sick call is conducted in the main medical clinic. \nGiven the varying practices of health care delivery at each facility, it is difficult to \naccurately estimate the number of nurses required statewide. However, it is our beliefthat \nstaffing at N.A. ChadeIjian is insufficient based upon the need to have Youth \nCorrectional Counselors administer medications. In addition, at Ventura YCF, only one \nnurse is staffed on weekends in the main medical unit. This means the nurse must leave \nthe main medical unit if there is an emergency in the facility. This poses a dilemma if a \nward is also housed in the OHU for medical reasons. \nPharmacy Staffing \nWith the exception of Preston Youth Correctional Youth Facility (PYCF), each facility \nprovides in-house pharmacy services. The seven sites reviewed employ six pharmacists \nand three pharmacy technicians. This is a pharmacy staff to ward ratio of 1 to 386. This is \nmore than adequate staff. \nIt was noted that some practices of the pharmacists are inefficient and labor intensive. At \nNYRCC, Preston YCF, and Herman G. Stark YCF, the pharmacists dispense each \nprescription on a daily, twice weekly, or weekly basis, when the prescription could be \ndispensed once for up to a 30-day period. This practice is inefficient and results in \npharmacists not addressing other important duties, such as establishing Standard Ward \nInventory (SWI) controls and checking expiration dates for medications that are stored \noutside the pharmacy. \nAnother example of inefficient practices is found at Herman G. Stark YCF. Staff reported \nthat when the nurses pick up the medication to take to the housing units, the pharmacists \nand nurses jointly count the medication in each dispensed package. The nurse signs that \nshe has received the specified quantity of medication. This practice was instituted \nbecause of discrepancies in what the pharmacist dispensed and what nurses stated they \nreceived. This is labor intensive for both the pharmacists and nurses. \nDental Staffing \nAccording to the California Department ofthe Youth Authority Dental Standards of Care \n(February 1999), dental services for the wards in the CYA are provided by 17 dentists, 3 \nchief dentists, and 19 dental assistants. In October 2002 there were 5730 wards in the \nCY A. This is a dentist to ward ratio of 1 to 286 that is more than sufficient staff to care \nfor the dental needs at the 11 CY A facilities. \nSince these are clearly sufficient numbers, it would be more appropriate to perform an \nongoing evaluation of productivity of the existing dentists. One particular problematic \nsite, in terms of access, was Chad. At the Chad facility, the dentist sees an average of \n1112012003  Page 11 \n\n1. Does the CYA have an appropriate number of medical and dental professionals? \nthree wards a day because wards are not transported to the dental office due to secu.rity \nissues. In addition, the dentist at that facility had a narrow interpretation of the scope of \nwork req:uired (see Dental Standards of Care). Therefore, at Chad, the dentist performs no \npreventive work. Instead, he primarily conducts emergency evaluations in response to \nward pain: This is not in keeping with the existing dental standards. \nMedical Record, Laboratory and Radiology Technician Staffing \nEach of the facilities reviewed employed a health record technician. This staffing appears \nto be adequate. \nThe Northern YCRCC is the only facility with a licensed clinical laboratory. A .75 FTE \nlaboratory technician is employed at the facility. Only syphilis (RPR) screening and \nurinalysis testing is performed in-house. There is a statewide contract with Unilab, which \nperfonns all other lab testing. This is more than adequate laboratory staffing. \nRadiology services are provided on-site at each facility, ranging from a 0.1 to a 1.0 FTE. \nThe volume of x-ray films is relatively low and required most often for ruling out \nfractures. At Herman G. Stark YCF, a full-time radiology technician is employed. A \nreview of the radiology log for the months of September-December 2002, showed that on \naverage, 3 wards a day required x-rays. At the Northern YCRCC, a .50 radiology \ntechnician is employed. An average of 3-4 wards a day required x-rays. This is more than \nadequate radiology technician staffing. \nRecommendations: \n1.  At the CYA   Headquarters level, Security and Health Care authorities should \nstandardize policies and procedures regarding mechanisms of health care delivery \nat the facilities. With the exception of lockdown units, centralization of services is \nrecommended to reduce staffing requirements. \n2.  Following the standardization of policies and procedures, CYA   Headquarters \nshould conduct a comparative review of health position assignments by site and \nre-allocate positions based on medical and security needs such as medical \nmission, size, etc. \n3.  With regard to physician hiring practices, the Chief of Health Services Division \nshould preferentially hire physicians with Board Certification in Pediatrics, \nMedicine or Family Practice. To most appropriately use current staff, consider \nconsolidating wards with chronic illness at facilities with physicians Board \nCertified in a primary care field so that care is appropriately provided. \n4.  The Chief of Health Care Services Division (HCSD) should review physician \nscheduling practices, work expectations, and productivity. Physicians should be \n1112012003  Page 12 \n\n1. Does the eYA have an appropriate number of medical and dental professionals? \ncompensated for hours worked.  Taking call and some direct patient care should \nbe part of routine expectation of the CMO. \n5.  Given the low medical acuity of the wards, and small facility size, nurse sta:ffing \nshould be re-evaluated.  If patients with diabetes and significant chronic disease \nare classified to only certain facilities, nurse staffing could be reduced to 16 hours \nper day versus 24 hours per day at some facilities without such patients.  To \nevaluate this further, a study should be undertaken for 3 to 6 months evaluating \nthe number of urgent events that occur on the night shift and to an alternate \nclassification system to redirect wards with chronic illness to specific facilities. \n6.  At a minimum, pharmacy labor practices should be reviewed to increase \nefficiency. \n7.  Strong consideration should be given to outsourcing pharmacy. \n8.  Routine radiology services may be able to be outsourced provided that there is a \nmechanism for emergent and urgent radiology services. \n9.  It is not cost effective to have a licensed laboratory and .75 laboratory FTE at \nNorthern YCRCC for the purpose of conducting in-house syphilis and urinalysis \ntesting.  It is recommended that the laboratory is closed and all laboratory testing \nbe performed by the reference laboratory. \n10. CY A Headquarters should perform a productivity analysis of each dentist, based \non patients seen on a daily basis. Performance standards for dentists should be \ndeveloped, implemented, and monitored to meet community standards. As \nreferenced above, policies and procedures should be developed and enforced to \nimprove ward access to dental care. \n1112012003  Page 13 \n\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \n2. Is the eVA's medical and dental staff \nappropriately trained and supervised? \nConclusion: \nThe CYA  's medical and dental staff is not appropriately trained because there are no \nadequate orientation and training programs, policies and procedures, nor clinical \nguidelines to guide staff. In addition, the credentialing process for physicians is \ninadequate and does not ensure that competent physicians will be hired. Once hired, \nclinical supervision of physicians is virtually non-existent. \nThe absence of these components in the health care program is due to an absence of \nclinical and administrative leadership at the statewide level. \nFindings and Discussion: \nThe provision of an adequately trained and supervised staff requires: \n•  Appropriate guidance and oversight of a Statewide Responsible Health \nAuthority \n•  Development and implementation of standardized policies, procedures, and \nclinical guidelines \n•  Orientation and training to the respective policies and guidelines \n•  Periodic monitoring and oversight to ensure policy compliance \nEach of these areas is discussed below. \nStatewide Responsible Health Authority \nThe CYA   does not have a single medical authority actively responsible for delivery of \nhealth care to wards. The CYA Chief of Health Care Services, Dr. Jerrold Wheaton, has \nimplied supervisory role over physicians, but this relationship is ambiguous, not clarified \nin writing, and not evident in practice. \nWe reviewed a proposed table of organization for the Health Services Central Office that \ncreates centralized supervision of health care staff. However, this proposal has not been \nenacted. Currently, there is no Table of Organization that delineates reporting \nrelationships, and responsibility for health care delivery is diffuse, misunderstood, and \nambiguous. \nIn his Duty Statement, Dr. Wheaton has the responsibility to plan, operate, evaluate, and \nmonitor the cost and quality of health care services to wards of the CYA  . There is no \n1112012003  Page 14 \n\n---_._----\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \naccompanying supervisory authority with this responsibility. Therefore, the practical \neffect is that Dr. Wheaton serves only in an advisory capacity to the CYA  . He indicated \nto us that he has no authority to supervise physicians. He is authorized to write policy, but \nhe has no de facto authority to enact or establish changes in practice because he doesn't \nsupervise anyone in the field. The result is confusion and an absence of medical \nleadership. Physicians simultaneously recognize Dr. Wheaton as the Chief of Health Care \nServices, but in interviews there was no agreement amongst physicians as to what was \nDr. Wheaton's role. \nThe California Code of Regulations, Title 22 requires the CYA to establish Correctional \nTreatment Centers (CTC's), which are licensed health care facilities. Dr. Wheaton \nindicated to us that he spends all of his time initiating and organizing the Correctional \nTreatment Centers (CTCs). However, the amount oftime Dr. Wheaton has dedicated to \nthe CTC problem diverts management attention from the substantial issues involving \nday-to-day care ofthe wards.  In addition, based on the medical acuity of wards at the \nfacilities we visited, it is our opinion that very few wards will need Correctional \nTreatment Centers, as proposed, for medical care. Most moderately ill patients can be \nhandled in well-run outpatient housing units. There has been no estimate of the projected \nneed for CTC beds specifically for medical patients. These beds are most needed in the \narea of mental health. Nevertheless, Dr. Wheaton has interpreted the requirements of \nTitle 22 in a global manner and has organized the entire health care operation as if it were \na CTC. This is misguided, inefficient, ineffective, and expensive. \nIt is also our opinion that Dr. Wheaton's interpretation of Title 22 requirements, \nspecifically regarding administration of the medical staff, is overreaching and \nunnecessary. Routine medical care at the CY A is fundamentally outpatient primary care \nmedicine provided by an employee-unionized medical staffthat should be organized \nmuch like a health maintenance organization. \nCYABylaws \nEffective leadership requires a recognized statewide health authority. However, Dr. \nWheaton has authored Bylaws that attempt to organize the medical care system in a \nmanner similar to a hospital composed of a large group of private practitioners who have \nunique and individual financial interests in the management and rules of the hospital. The \nplan of organization, therefore, does not match the needs ofthe CY A or the qualifications \nof the staff.  The practical effect is an abdication of health care authority and \naccountability. \nBylaws are customarily the \"operating manual\" for a medical staff that is developed by, \nagreed to, and adhered to by an independent medical staff. However, the only physician \ncontributor in writing the CY A Bylaws was Dr. Wheaton. The Bylaws are complicated \nand difficult to understand and the medical staff does not see the Bylaws as their \n\"operating manual.\" Virtually all of the physicians we spoke to did nbt understand the \nBylaws; some did not understand their responsibility or the responsibility ofthe officers \nofthe medical staff as described in the Bylaws. \n11/20/2003  Page 15 \n\n2. Is the eVA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \nNevertheless, all individual physicians are required to participate in committees and vote \nfor officers even though they do not understand the responsibilities of the positions for \nwhich they are voting. In addition, some physicians do not have the administrative or \nclinical abilities required to provide the designated responsibilities. The expected result is \nindifference in participation by most physicians and ineffective supervision and \nmanagement of the health care program. For example, the current Chairperson ofthe \nInfection Control Committee did not understand fundamental issues involved in Infection \nControl in a correctional facility, yet he is responsible for that function. \nThe Chief of Staff role as delineated in the Bylaws is concerned with \"professional health \nservices in a consultative leadership role.\" The Chief of Staff is, therefore, a clinical and \nprofessional leadership role. Yet this is an elected position subject to personality, \nwillingness to serve, and availability. There is no guarantee of ability in an election. \nMany of the physician staff is poorly trained in medical leadership and some are poorly \ncredentialed to consult other physicians regarding medical care decisions. The most \nfrequent training history of the existing medical staffis an internship only. Given this \nfact, how could someone with such limited training provide guidance on clinical issues to \nthe medical staff. In fact, the most recent elected Chief of Staff had his election reversed \nbecause he did not attend the required number of meetings. \nUnder the CYA   Bylaws, it is also possible for a staff physician whose only training is an \ninternship to become Chief of Staff and have consultative responsibilities to his (her) \nCMO or to physicians who are Board Certified in a medical specialty. It is also entirely \npossible, given the current organizational structure, for an incompetent physician or a \nphysician with poor judgment to become the clinical and professional leader of the \nmedical staff. These are all undesirable but real scenarios. \nCustomarily, an Agency Medical Director provides the responsibility for supervisory \nleadership of a correctional health care program. In the CYA   Bylaws, that role has been \nre-distributed to staff physicians and CMOs, some of whom are poorly trained to provide \nsupervisory leadership and who are otherwise entirely engaged in provision of medical \ncare at their respective facilities. This organizational structure is poorly designed and is \nunlikely to result in adequate clinical leadership or clinically sound programs. This \nsituation also reflects poorly on the leadership abilities ofthe current Chief of the Health \nCare Services Division who designed and supports this system. There is very little \nappropriate clinical guidance or supervision provided to the medical staff, which very \nmuch operates without supervision, direction, or support. \nBudget and Administration \nThere is no statewide budget for health care in the CYA. Superintendents of individual \nfacilities are responsible for the medical care budget at their site. Because individual \nsuperintendents are not trained in health care administration, there is poor to little \noversight of health care expenditures. This is especially obvious in the area of pharmacy, \nwhere lack of inventory control and basic pharmacy management skills results in excess \n1112012003  Page 16 \n\n2. Is the eVA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \ninventory and considerable waste of resources.  We estimate very conservatively over \n$400,000 in excess inventory statewide. \nOther administrative functions, such as scheduling, supervision of non-clinical staff, \nsupply management, etc., are very much a local effort and in some cases are \nunsupervised. Distribution of medical resources is not planned on a statewide basis. \nTherefore, there is uneven distribution of resources and staffing through the system. One \nfacility (Preston YCF) did not have physician coverage when the CMO was on vacation, \nyet Herman G. Stark YCF has three physicians and amid-level practitioner even though \nthere was only one examination room in which to see patients. Statewide coordination of \nresources by the Chief of Health Services Division would ensure better distribution of \nresources. \nThe CMOs are responsible for the administrative management ofthe health care \nprogram, but lack expertise and training in this area.  As a result, management of the \nhealth care units is not business-like or thorough. There is no standardization of \nadministrative, non-clinical processes in the medical units.  There is not a single person in \nthe CYA   who could responsibly discuss the cost of care, expenditures for health care, or \nthe administration of the statewide health care program in a manner that demonstrated \noperational efficiency, standardization, and accountability. Although CYA   reports* \nindicate that in fiscal year 200212003, it cost $49,200 to house each ward, the CYA does \nnot know how much it spends on health care overall, nor can it breakdown expenditures \naccording to category (pharmaceuticals, hospitalizations, etc.). This lack of \nadministrative oversight creates operational deficiencies and additional costs. CMOs \nshould provide clinical administrative management, but appropriate administrative \nsupport for business functions could free up time for CMOs to provide some direct \npatient care.  This type of arrangement would be a better use of resources. \n*CYA   Fact, Department of Juvenile Justice, October 2002. \nMonitoring and Oversight \nAdequate clinical supervision of medical, nursing, dental and pharmacy practice requires \na process of periodic on~site review by professionals qualified by training and experience \nto conduct such reviews at a statewide level. In addition, the reviewer should be \nempowered to make changes should deficiencies be found. The Health Care Services \nDivision does not have a formal program of clinical oversight that results in routine \nreview of clinical and nursing practice. \nIn the CYA  , the CMO reports to the Superintendent ofthe facility. By CYA policy, the \nCMO is responsible for the \"public health\" of the wards. The Superintendents are \nresponsible for completing the perfOlmance evaluations of the CMOs. (NOTE: We did \nnot review the perfOlmance evaluations of the CMOs.) A layperson, such as the \nSuperintendent, is not qualified to review the clinical performance of physicians. \n1112012003  Page 17 \n\n.. \n~---- \"\"-\"'-\" \n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \nAs a result, a qualified medical person does not evaluate the clinical performance of the \nCYA   physicians in a formal or reportable way. We believe that this has a detrimental \nimpact on health care and contributes to ongoing substandard clinical care in several \nfacilities we visited. A physician must supervise practicing physicians. \nThe Peer Review function as described in the CYA   Bylaws could be an opportunity to \nevaluate medical care. However, there is no mechanism for the Peer Review Committee \nto evaluate physician practice in an organized manner, and in practice the Peer Review \nCommittee is not engaged in any meaningful evaluations of physician practice. \nThe Statewide Director of Nurses is a position that has no line authority over CYA   \nnurses. She does not have clinical authority to guide nursing practice in the CYA  . At each \nfacility, the Supervising Nurse reports to the CMO. Therefore, ifthe CMO does not \nconcur with the Director of Nurses, her recommendations are not enforced. \nIn addition, there is no oversight of pharmacy practice or expenditures in the CYA  . \nDuring our reviews we found varying and sometimes questionable practices of \nmedication storage, dispensing and administration. \nPolicies and Procedures \nWritten policies and procedures are essential to establish clinical standards and practices, \nand should be used to orient and train staff. Clinical practices and processes at facilities \nwe visited were not guided by standardized policy or procedure. \nStaff at most facilities indicated that they referred to The Department of Youth Authority \nMedical and Dental Services Institutions and Camps Manual as their policy and \nprocedure manual. Staff could also produce, when requested, a facility-specific policy \nand procedure manual that contained a variable number of medical policies. These \nmanuals varied from site to site. However when we asked staff members regarding their \nuse of the policy and procedure manual, there was a general lack of recognition at \nvirtually all sites. In some cases, staff did not know ifthere was a policy and procedure \nmanual. \nIn summary, there was no standardized policy and procedure manual that guides clinical \nor medical administrative practice at all facilities. \nDeveloping Policy and Procedure \nThere is no established mechanism to develop policy or procedure. It was reported to us \nthat Dr. Wheaton drafts all new policies and procedures. The CMOs do not participate in \ndevelopment or review these documents. They view policy development as top-down and \nnon-collaborative. In addition, the Director of Nurses, Deborah Pettigrew, does not have \nthe authority to develop or provide meaningful input regarding policies related to nursing \npractice. She is provided the opportunity to comment on policies developed by Dr. \nWheaton, but does not receive feedback regarding her input.  Policies are not reviewed \nand updated annually. \n1112012003  Page 18 \n\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \nIn the absence of timely policy development and distribution, Dr. Wheaton issues policy \ntype positions in memos to the staff This is generally not acceptable practice for routine \nissues. This ad hoc policy-by-memo practice increases confusion, does not provide staff \nwith information on the rationale for the new practice, and in some cases does not \nappropriately define the policy change. As an example, a Supervising Nurse reported that \ndirectives from the HCSD are often unworkable, because the memos are generated \nwithout consulting personnel who have to carry out the directive. When she calls Dr. \nWheaton to seek direction, he tells her to do it differently than the published memo_ It \nwas her belief that different facilities are given different direction verbally. \nAnother example was a memo from Dr. Wheaton that prohibited PRN medication. PRN \nis medication that is used only as needed. There probably was a reason that resulted in \nthis policy-memo change, however, the unintended consequence was confusion. PRN \nmedications are necessary for routine care. For example, most pain and asthma \nmedications are prescribed PRN as a matter of practice. When this memo was distributed, \nphysicians were given no options for alternative methods of prescribing \"as needed\" \nmedication. Because the memo did not make sense, physicians either ignored the memo \nor changed prescriptions to routine dosing, which is not always clinically appropriate and \nis possibly wasteful of staff time. \nWhen Dr. Wheaton develops policies and procedures that impact institutional operations \n(sick call, transfers, etc.), there is no apparent participation by custody staff as would be \nevidenced by a sign-off on the policy. Training on new policy is never done. \nCurrent Policy Manual \nBecause the policy manual most often referred to by staff was the Medical and Dental \nServices Institution and Camps Manual (dated October 11, 2002), we reviewed that \nmanual as the standard policy and procedure manual. (There is a draft revision of this \nmanual dated January 2,2003, however this version has not been implemented.) We have \ndetailed our concerns about this manual in the following information. \nThe current policies in the Institution and Camps Manual (1011112002) do not address \nkey aspects of health care structure and services as outlined in the NeCHC Standards for \nHealth Services in Juvenile Detention and Confinement Facilities. For example, the \nfollowing are not addressed: \n•  Orientation Training for Health Services Staff (Y -27) \n•  Continuing Education for Qualified Health Care Professionals (Y-20) \n•  Medication Administration Training (Y-22) \n•  Daily Handling of Non-Emergency Medical Requests (Y-38) \n•  Sick Call (Y-39) \n•  Health Evaluation of Juveniles in Segregation (Y -40) \n1112012003  Page 19 \n\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \n•  Pharmaceuticals (Y-29) \n•  Infirmary (i.e., OHU) Care (Y -52), as well as others \nSome policies include procedures that provide specific guidance to staff (Informed \nConsent, Section 6168), while other policies provide no procedure outlining how th.e \npolicy is to be implemented (Sick call). \nMany policies in the current Institutions and Camps Manual reflect irregular practice or \nless than acceptable standard of care. As examples: \nOne policy says if a ward refused preventive TB treatment or treatment for Hepatitis C, \nthey should be given counseling.  The policy offers no guidance as to what they should \nbe counseled about. Additionally, wards who refuse TB prophylaxis are to be housed in \nan \"infection control room\" until proven non-infectious. The definition of \"non \ninfectious\" is unclear. If the ward had TB disease, they would not be given prophylaxis \ntherapy. If the patient only has TB infection, they are not infectious to others. This policy \nis misguided, and demonstrates poor knowledge ofTB infection and disease. However, \nsince there is no other infection control policy or infection control manual to which CYA   \nstaff can refer, this would be the policy followed by CYA   staff. \nThe tuberculosis screening policy is inappropriate and does not follow Centers for \nDisease Control (CDC) standards. The existing policy requires that a Mantoux (TB) skin \ntest be performed upon intake, repeated every April during a statewide testing program, \nand repeated whenever a ward is transferred to a different institution or returns from out \nof-court or \"overnight absence.\" The test is repeated again 30 days after the transfer or \nabsence. As wards are frequently transferred, this practice inevitably results in testing far \nin excess of Centers for Disease Control standards and is not clinically appropriate or \nsound from an infection control perspective. \nThe policy on examination after return from furlough, escape, or parole is not clinically \nsound. Notably this policy includes: \n•  Isolation upon return until \"medically cleared.\" \n•  High-risk behavior requires a chemistry panel and encouragement to take an \nHIV test. (High-risk behavior is not defined.) \n•  A hepatitis panel if intravenous drug has occurred. \n•  Evidence of lice requires in-patient treatment \nThere is no clinical rationale for any of these practices. \nThe Institutions and Camps Manual policy on examination of food service workers \nrequires a chemistry panel and a Mantoux test. There is no clinical evidence to support \nrequiring these tests.  A policy states that no ward with an infectious disease may be a \nfood service handler. This policy applies to wards with communicable diseases that are \nnot transmitted by food handling (TB infection, hepatitis B, C, ilIV, etc.). This policy \ndoes not make sense in the light of how these infections are transmitted. \n1112012003  Page 20 \n\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \nThere is a policy describing a \"Medical Utilization Review Process\" which describes a \nprocess to ensure appropriate use of health care services and resources. However, for all \npractical purposes, this process does not take place in the facilities in a meaningful way. \nThe policy for medication administration permits officers or correctional youth \ncounselors to deliver medication to wards ifthere are insufficient nurses. This is \ninappropriate. \nSince medical clearance is required for wards that may be assigned to a work camp, clear \nmedical policy guidelines should be provided in the manual. \nThe draft Institutions and Camps Manual policies (dated 1/2/2003) are more \ncomprehensive and are cross-referenced with NCHHC Standards. However, as with the \ncurrent policies, they do not provide procedural guidance as to how each policy is to be \nimplemented. The result is no standardization of practice in the CYA  . \nClinical and Nursing Treatment Protocols \nThe Central Office produced a Treatment Guideline Manual that has some useful \nguidelines. However, there is no evidence that anyone actually uses the manual, in part \nbecause it is not user-friendly. In addition, the choice of topics in this manual is not \nreflective of the types of conditions that affect, or are likely to affect, the wards. For \nexample, it is unlikely that any of the wards will acquire strongyloidiasis, amebiasis, \nanthrax, or brucellosis (all topics in the Treatment Guideline Manual). \nAlso, clear and adequate information on the eight most common medical conditions or \ninterventions based on CYA   statistics (vaccination, TB screening, asthma,· diabetes, \nhypertension, hypothyroidism, medical clearance for camp, and epilepsy) is lacking in the \nTreatment Guideline Manual. For other conditions that are referenced, such as HIV \ninfection, the treatment information is not current and uses terminology that is obscure. \nSome information in the Treatment Guideline Manual should be updated and peer \nreviewed by persons knowledgeable in the areas of concern. Some information also needs \nto be rewritten for accuracy and pertinence to the CYA. For example: \n•  Folliculitis, furuncles, carbuncles and abscesses are different conditions that \nare medically treated differently. Folliculitis, which is seldom treated with \nantibiotics, and abscesses, which are often treated with antibiotics, should be \nseparated from furuncles and carbuncles, which mayor may not be treated \nwith antibiotics. The choice of antibiotics for skin abscesses should be \nreviewed for appropriateness. Culture should be incorporated into evaluation \nof abscess due to the resurgence of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus \nAureus (MRSA). \n•  The impetigo protocol is not clear. It appears that two antibiotics are \nrecommended for treatment. \n•  The otitis extema protocol does not differentiate mild from severe disease and \ndoes not give guidance on when to use antibiotics. This will probably result in \ninappropriate overuse of oral antibiotics. \n11/2012003  Page 21 \n\n2. Is the eVA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \n•  The protocol on acute pharyngitis should be clear that treatment is begun only \nafter a positive culture is obtained. \n•  The asthma protocol should be combined into a single protocol. It should be \nsimplified so that it is understandable and gives clearer guidelines. We \nrecommend utilizing the NCCHC guideline for asthma,or the Guidelines for \nthe Diagnosis and Management ofA  sthma. The NCCHC Guideline can be \nobtained free from http://www.ncchc.org/links/clinicalguides.html. The \nGuidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma can be obtained \nfrom http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthmalasthgdln.htm. The CYA \nprotocol should emphasize nurse education on inhaler use, peak flow \nassessment, and indications for using rescue vs. maintenance therapy and \ncorrectional issues such as when to permit keep on person medication. There \nshould be guidance provided to nurses regarding how to assess wards during \noff-hours and guidance to physicians on telephone triage for this condition. \n•  There should be sections on hypertension and epilepsy. For hypertension and \nepilepsy, the NCCHC guidelines can be used. As an alternative, a guideline \ncan be written referencing the \"Joint National Committee for the Prevention, \nDetection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure\" (JNC-7), \nwhich can be located at \nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertensionfindex.htm. \n•  Use ofamitryptiline or imipramine should be discouraged for dyspepsia. We \nstrongly urge reviewing the dyspepsia protocol with peer review. The protocol \ndoes not differentiate dyspepsia from peptic ulcer disease and therefore will \nresult in confusion on issues of therapy. \n•  There are two diabetes protocols, which are not in agreement. This is very \nconfusing. A single protocol should exist based on NCCHC guidelines or on \nguidelines from the American Diabetes Association \n(http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/vo126/suppl  II#POSITION  STATE \nMENTS). These protocols should be improved for clarity and direction. \n•  The protocol on diabetic ketoacidosis is mostly didactic and does not provide. \nappropriate practical clinical direction. For example, one problem in the CYA   \nis that providers do not seem to understand the simple clinical scenario that if \nthe blood sugar is high (over 350 to 400), urine ketones should be checked to \nassess for ketoacidosis. This fundamental direction is not present in the \nTreatment Guidelines Manual. It is clear from chart reviews that some of the \nphysicians do not understand, or ignore this fundamental issue. \n•  \"Thyroid Malfunction\" is the title for a protocol about thyroiditis, one of \nmany thyroid conditions. It would be better to have protocols on \nhyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. It was clear from chart reviews that one \nphysician did not know the difference between these two common conditions. \n•  The section on anemia should be revised after peer review for content. The \nsection on sickle cell anemia is fundamentally and clinically inaccurate. The \nstatement that \"Hydroxyurea is the only effective treatment\" for sickle cell \n1112012003  Page 22 \n\n---------\n---------\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \ndisease is inaccurate and ifused, this infonnation will be hannful to wards. \nOne ward that did have sickle disease was mismanaged cruelly, without \nadequate pain medication and fluids, nor timely evaluation for infection_ The \ncurrent protocol would not have helped inhis care. This entire section should \nbe revised since it gives incomplete and inaccurate infonnation. \n•  The guidelines for head trauma and head injury are confusing and give poor \ndirection. These should be revised with peer review. \n•  The protocol on HIV is out-of-date with contemporary standards of care and \nshould be revised with peer review. This is not a condition that should be \nmanaged by in-house physicians in the manner indicated. \n•  The \"Hepatitis Diagnosis and Treatment\" protocol requires unnecessary \ntesting that will raise costs. It calls for screening all wards that have elevated \nliver tests with a complete hepatitis panel that tests for hepatitis A, B, and C. It \nis not necessary to screen for Hepatitis A because chronic ongoing infection is \nrarely present and most wards will have already been vaccinated for hepatitis \nB and therefore test positive. Therefore, the complete panel will usually be \nunnecessary and raise the cost of the screening by approximately about $40 \nper test. \n•  Hepatitis C treatment should be addressed in a separate protocol. The manner \nof addressing Hepatitis C is superficial, clinically confusing, and will result in \nhigh cost without clear clinical benefit.  This protocol should be carefully \ndeveloped with peer review. We suggest that the CYA   get consultation from \nthe California Department of Corrections (CDC) Medical Division for this \nprotocol. \n•  The \"Hepatitis Check Sheet\" is a very confusing protocol since it is not clear \nwhat it is for. This protocol should be eliminated or substantially revised. \nThere is a virtual lack of guidance for nursing assessments or procedures. At several \ninstitutions, staff reported that they were aware of Standard Nursing Procedures that \nconsists of 5\"x 8\" cards with typed directions for the management of athlete's foot, \npoison oak, asthma, and head injury. These cards had dates ranging from 1987 to 2000. \nIn some cases, typed sentences were crosse~ out with new directions documented. The \nprotocols contain no references. Staff reported that they have received no training \nregarding these Standardized Nursing Procedures. \nCredentialing \nCredentialing is a review process that verifies the identity, training, experience and \ncompetence of an individual professional practitioner. Credentialing is an essential part of \nselecting professional staff to hire and will determine the composition and strength of the \nmedical staff. In addition, the credential process nonnally grants \"privileges\" to \npractitioners. Privileges are medical or psychiatric procedures or practices that an \nindividual professional is allowed to perfonn based on their training and experience. \n1112012003  Page 23 \n\n2. Is the eVA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \nCredentialing in the CYA   is perfonned according to directions in the CYA   Bylaws. \nHowever, the Bylaws are poorly written and provide incomplete direction for appropriate \ncredentialing. Keys points of credentialing in the CYA   as derived from the Bylaws are: \n1.  The CYA   Personnel Selection Section provides the credentials committee with a \nlist of applicants for a professional position. \n2.  The Credentials Committee consists of the Chief, HCSD, the Chief of Staff, and \nother members appointed by the Health Services Executive Committee. \n3.  The ChiefHCSD is authorized to query the National Practitioner's Data Bank \n(NPDB). \n4.  A member of the Committee queries other societies and boards regarding the \napplicant. \nS.  Information from the NPDB is sent to the CYA   Division of Personnel Selection \nSection in order for them to make their selection. There is no guidance on what \ninformation should be sent to the Personnel Selection Section. \n6.  The CYA   Personnel Selection Section interviews candidates and they choose the \nphysician(s ). \n7.  The actual process of credentialing as performed by the credentials committee is \nnot delineated. What that Committee does is detennined in large part by the \nability and knowledge of the Chief of Staff who is responsible for organization of \nthe Committee. If someone inexperienced in credentialing is in that position, \nevaluation of candidates for staff will suffer. \nDeficiencies in this process are described in the following: \n1.  Licensure and other professional regulation requirements are not specified in the \nBylaws. It is not clear in the Bylaws whether it is a requirement to have a medical \nlicense or Drug Enforcc:ment Agency license to practice in the CYA  . \n2.  There are significant deficiencies in the existing credential application. The \ncredential application does not include questions regarding substance control \nlicense verification, primary verification of license, queries regarding substance \nabuse or physical impainnent to practice, prior malpractice claims, prior \nrevocation or refusal to grant hospital privileges or prior felony convictions.·All \nof these questions should be asked and it should be required to answer all \nquestions on the fonn. There is a new proposed form that is satisfactory, but it is \nnot yet being used. \n3.  Nowhere do the CYA Bylaws establish that a physician or group of physicians \nmake the judgment on the competency of professional candidates. In fact, \nevaluation of competency is not described in the credentialing process. It appears \nthat the role of the Credentials Committee is secretarial in nature. It is not even \nclear that their function is advisory. Their direction is to query professional \ninfonnation sources for infonnation on the candidate. Based on the Bylaws, the \nCYA   Personnel Selection Section is responsible for the judgment of deciding \n1112012003  Page 24 \n\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \nwhich candidates to choose for professional service. Because the process is a civil \nservice selection process, the role of the Credential Committee is to merely rank \nindividuals. By written policy this process should be described. As well, there \nshould be criteria for which a physician can be excluded from practicing in the \nCYA  . Physicians should make judgments on competency of physicians and there \nshould be the ability to exclude physicians from practicing in the CYA   who are \nunlikely to know how to treat most medical conditions ofthe wards. \n4.  There is no established written procedure or process for granting privileges. A \nphysician who requested privileges was not granted them by the Credentials \nCommittee, but the Chief overruled this recommendation. The rationale for this \ndecision was not entered into the credential packet of the practitioner. \n5.  The credentials process does not ensure that physicians treating wards have core \ncompetencies in the specialty areas of medicine related to wards in the CYA  . \n6.  The secretarial work delegated to the Chairperson ofthe Credentials Committee is \nsubstantial. This individual is elected from the medical staff and already has full \nclinical and sometimes administrative responsibilities at one of the facilities. This \nwork should be the responsibility ofthe Chief ofthe Health Care Service and \nherlhis staff. \n7.  No administrative support is provided to the Chief of Staff who is delegated with \nresponsibility for the clerical function of collecting credential information and \npassing it on to the Selection Section. Existing credential files, ostensibly \ncontaining sensitive personnel information, are maintained in a cardboard box in a \nphys~cian office. \n8.  Physicians do not understand or participate in the credential process. One Chief \nMedical Officer was unaware of the credential status of physicians working at his \nsite. Several physicians we spoke with didn't know the meaning or purpose of \ncredentialing. One doctor didn't remember ifhe filled out the forms. Another \ndoctor, a CMO, didn't know what credentialing was all about. Another physician, \nwho was not credentialed, remembers filling out a form but can't remember ifhe \nis credentialed. In addition, physicians do not completely fill out the application \nform. Some physicians do not answer questions such as \"Has your license ever \nbeen revoked?\" \n9.  Although the Bylaws authorize a National Practitioner Data Bank search, this is \nnot o.ccurring at all. All practitioner applications should include a query oftheir \npast history with the National Practitioner Data Bank. \n10. It is also not established by policy, who will evaluate negative information \nobtained on the application and how the information will be evaluated. As an \nexample, the proposed Application for Appointment to Medical Staff contains the \nfollowing question: \"Has your California license ever been revoked or had any \nrestrictions placed on it 7\" Based on the Bylaws, this information will be collected \nand passed on to the CYA   Personnel Selection Section to pass judgment. \nExperienced professionals should make these types ofj udgments. There should be \npolicy to delineate this. \n1112012003  Page 25 \n\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \n11. Peer review should also be factored into credentialing decisions. There is no \norganized mechanism of peer review or other clinical reviews to identify critical \nphysician deficiencies. Therefore, physicians may be credentialed who are \nunethical or otherwise deficient in medical practice. One glaring example is the \ncase of the physician who for years had a policy of not prescribing narcotic \nmedication to any ward for any reason. Such a physician should be reported to the \nCalifornia Medical Board for unethical practice. Yet, this practice was unnoticed \nfor years and this physician was credentialed and in good standing in the CYA  . \nNot all CYA physicians are credentialed. However, the complement of non-psychiatrist \nphysicians practicing in the CYA   who are credentialed have varied backgrounds. There \nwere credential files on 15 non-psychiatrist physicians. Of these, three were Board \nCertified in Pediatrics, one was Board Certified in Medicine, and two were Board \nCertified in Family Practice. Three physicians were trained in surgery but were not Board \nCertified, one was trained in Anesthesiology, and five physicians had internships only. \nThis is not a good mix of training for a popUlation of wards whose primary needs is for \nPediatrics and Medicine or Family Practice. \nLicensure Review \nLicenses of professional staff were reviewed at each facility.  With regard to licensure \ntracking systems, we were told that both the CMO and Health Care Services Division \nwere responsible for tracking professional licensure.  However, at several facilities, these \ntracking systems were not current.  Some reflected licenses as outdated as 1999. \nHowever, when requested, all staffwere able to produce current licenses except two \npsychology positions at the Northern Youth Reception Center.  We were told that these \npsychologists are working under the license of another psychologist. \nOrientation and Training \nCurrentCYA policies (dated 10/1912002) do not address orientation, training, and \ncontinuing education of health care personnel. Draft policies (dated 112/2003) state \"Each \ninstitution shall develop and implement an orientation program for each employee.\" \nHowever, there is no guidance as to the required elements of orientation. In practice, each \nfacility has developed their own orientation program' that consists primarily of On-the \nJob (OJT) training in the absence of statewide policies and procedures. One Supervising \nNurse reported that she is expected to train her staff, but that she does not receive training \nfrom the Health Care Services Division. \nStaff report that training is periodically provided by Cassie Jones RN, Statewide Public \nHealth Nurse, regarding a variety of subjects related to public health, including annual \nstaff recertification of TB skin testing, respirator fit testing, etc. According to staff, the \ntraining that provided, or coordinated by Ms Jones is the only consistent training \nprovided in the CYA  . \n1112012003  Page 26 \n\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \nPosition Descriptions \nPosition descriptions are functional job descriptions as opposed to civil service or union \njob classifications. They provide clarification regarding duties and are specific to the \nfacility and to the position held. In general, the CYA   does not have position descriptions \nfor each job category, which can be used to orient new personnel, and guide temporary or \nagency health care personnel employed by CY A. At H.G. Stark, the Supervising Nurse \nhad prepared position descriptions for approval by Headquarters, but the approval has not \ntaken place and the position descriptions are not in place. \nRecommendations: \nHealth Care Organization and Leadership \n1.  Re-evaluate the current Chief of the Health Services Division position, including \nwhether the incumbent is the right person for this position. \n2.  Establish an organization structure that provides the Statewide Medical Director \nwith supervisory responsibility over all physicians and dentists. The Director of \nNurses should also have clinical authority and responsibility for nursing practice \nin the CYA. \n3.  Consider separation of clinical and administrative oversight of the medical \nprogram. Establish a statewide Administrator responsible for the administrative \nfunctions of the health care system. This could be the Medical Director provided \nthat person is experienced in health care administration. \n4.  Establish a separate health care budget and accounting system, administered by \nthe Medical Services Administrator.  The health care budget should be itemized \nby type of expenditure (personnel, pharmacy, hospitalizations, physician fees, etc) \nso that these expenditures can be monitored and controlled. \n5.  Create a table of organization for the Health Services Clinical Division. \nAdministrative and Clinical Policies and Procedures \n1.  Establish a statewide, juvenile specific, health care policy and procedure manual \nthat standardizes care statewide. \n2.  Ensure collaboration and sign-off by corrections at a senior administrative level of \nall policy and procedure. \n3.  The CYA   headquarters HCSD should establish orientation and training programs \nfor staff.  In addition, facility health care leadership (medical, nursing) should \nestablish local operating procedure describing how the statewide policy will be \nimplemented at the facility. \n4.  Significantly modify the Treatment Guideline Manual to conform to accepted \nnational standards of care, and to include all relevant conditions and processes of \nhealth care for juveniles. Ensure that the Treatment Guideline Manual has \nadequate peer review. \n1112012003  Page 27 \n\n2. Is the eYA's medical and dental staff appropriately trained and supervised? \n5.  The Statewide Director of Nurses should develop and implement an appropriate \nstatewide-standardized nursing protocol manual. \n6.  Eliminate the CYA   Bylaws as the organizational structure of the medical staff \nSubstitute an HMO employee model with appropriate rules and regulations. \nCreate simplified Bylaws to conform to Title 22 requirements for the CTCs only. \nOversight and Monitoring \n1.  Reassign credentialing to the Health Care Services Division to be the \nresponsibility ofthe statewide Medical Director. \n2.  Ensure that the credentials process verifies that practitioners have up-to-date \napplicable licenses. Specify the requirements for practicing in the CYA  . \n3.  Perform a National Practitioner Databank search for each physician on staff. \n4.  Evaluate all physicians regarding possible substance control problems, past or \npresent problems with their license, physical or psychological impairments that \nmay limit ability to practice, prior malpractice claims, prior revocation of license \nor revocation of hospital privileges, and any prior felony convictions. \n5.  Ensure that the credentialing process judges the competency of the prospective \nphysician candidates and their ability by training, experience, and character to \npractice in the CYA  . Consider outsourcing this function if the current \narrangements do not change. \n6.  Guarantee the ~onfidentiality and security ofthe credential files. \n7.  Initiate regular peer review and physician-directed evaluations of all physicians \nby the Central Office. \n8.  Establish an ethical standard, approved by the Director of the CYA and statewide \nMedical Director regarding pain management, physician practice, and physician \nautonomy. \n9.  The CMO and Supervising Nurse at each facility should establish licensure \ntracking systems and monitor to ensure that all staff has a valid license.  In \naddition, the HCSD Statewide Medical and Nursing Director should audit \nlicensure when making periodic site visits. \nOrientation and Training \n1.  The CYA   Headquarters Division should establish Continuing Medical Education \n(CME) guidelines for the medical staff. \n2.  The CYA Headquarters Division in collaboration with facility staff should create \nstatewide-standardized job descriptions for every position in the medical area. \n3.  The Health Care Services Division Statewide Medical and Nursing Director \nshould conduct periodic training needs assessments of staff. Training needs may \nbe identified through aUditing results as well as staff feedback regarding training \nneeds. \n1112012003  Page 28 \n\n3. Are the eVA's medical and dental recorcfs appropriate? \n3. Are the eVA's 'medical and dental records \nappropriate? \nConclusion: \nThe Unified Medical Record used by the CYA   is a comprehensive and reasonably well \norganized and adequate record-keeping system. There are some organizational issues, \nnone of which makes the system inadequate. \nFindings and Discussion: \nHealth Record Format and Content \nThe Institutions and Camps Manual Medical and Dental Service policies (10/1/2002, \ndraft 11212003) addresses the Unified Health Record, which is the primary method of \nrecord keeping used by the CYA  . These policies discuss the initiation, transfer, storage \nand retrieval of health records when wards return to the CYA via parole revocation. The \npolicies also address confidentiality of health record information and access and \ndisclosure of confidential medical information. \nThe CYA   Unified Health Record (UHR) is comprehensive. It is organized in the \nfollowing manner: \n•  Ward name and allergies are noted on the front of the chart. \n•  Left side of record: \no  Alert Tab -This section contains Medical Restrictions, Medical Holds, \nCamp Clearance and Food Service Clearance; \no  Movement and Problem List Tab-This section contains the Movement and \nProblem List sheet which records the wards picture, admission and \ntransfer dates and medical problems; \no  Database Tab -This section contains the following information: admission \nWard Personal Information and Physical Examination, Ward Physical \nCondition, Intake Documents, County Health Records; \no  Public Health Tab -This section contains the wards Tuberculin Skin \nTesting, Immunization Record and History, Other immunization and \npublic health records, and the Confidentiality Morbidity Report; \no  Medication and Treatment Records Tab -This section contains Medication \nAdministration Records and Diabetic Record. \n•  Right side of record: \no  Top - Suicide Alert \no  Chronological Notes Tab-This section contains the Unified Health Record \nTransfer Review, Summary of Medical Record, Chronological Notes, and \nPrenatal Record \n1112012003  Page 29 \n\n3. Are the eVA's medical and dental records appropriate? \na  Mental Health Tab-This section contains the Psychological Evaluation \nReport, Psychiatric Evaluation Report, YA-GAF Screening Report, SPAR: \n5-Minute Suicide Watch Record, Mental Health Assessment, SPAR: \nSuicide Risk Screening Questionnaire, SPAR: Referral and Disposition, \nSPAR: Report of Suicidal Incident, SPAR: IS-Minute Suicide Watch \nRecord, Other mental health reports. \na  Dental Tab -The dental record. \na  Diagnostic Reports Tab -This section contains x-ray and laboratory \nreports, electrocardiograms, electroencephalograms, audio grams and other \ndiagnostic reports. \na  Consultations Tab -This section contains consultant records, copies of off \nsite physician and hospital reports and records, and eye examinations \ncharts. \na  Consents and Authorizations Tab -This section contains Request for Court \nOrder to Administer Anti-androgen Medication, Request for Court Order \nfor Authorization for Treatment, Ward Rights, Involuntary Psychotropic \nMedication, Certification Hearing Notice, Notice of Certification, \nCorrespondence, Subpoenas, Court Orders, Death Certificate, Autopsy \nReports and Consents for HIV antibody testing, and HIV Counseling \nForms. \nProblems with Record Keeping \nAlthough the organization and content of the health record by policy is comprehensive, \nthere were some problems with its organization. These include the following: \n1.  The Problem List is not visible when the record is opened and often is not \ncompleted. This makes it more likely to not be reviewed or updated as necessary. \nIn actual practice, we found this to be the case. \n2.  The Consent for Medical Treatment section is printed on the back ofthe Ward \nPersonal History form (YA 8.252 (Rev 01101). In practice, this form is being filed \nin the consent section of the record, not with the Database as dictated by policy. \n3.  The Ward Personal History form contains useful medical history information \nbut is somewhat out of date with current consensus standards for preventive \nassessments of adolescents. A nurse collects the history, and there is no evidence \nin the records that the physician reviews or validates the information. It does not \ncontain a signature line for a health care professional. During reviews of health \nrecords, none of the Ward Personal History forms were initialed as having been \nreviewed by a health care provider. This suggests this information is not \nconsidered when the physical examination is conducted. \n4.  The Dental section of the record is by policy not maintained in the Unified Health \nRecord (UHR). This may result in the dental staff not being apprised of important \nmedical information (allergies, need for antibiotic prophylaxis) that is learned \nafter the medical reception process. \n5 .. Laboratory reports are not consistently initialed and dated. This raises questions \nabout whether or not they were reviewed and addressed by clinicians. HIV \nantibody test information is sometimes found in the consent section of the record \n1112012003  Page 30 \n\n3. Are the eVA's medical and dental records appropriate? \nattached to the HN testing consent form, rather than the diagnostic tests section \nof the health record. \n6.  Consultant reports are often not found in the record for wards that have gone \noff-site for care. In addition, we could seldom identify that the ·results of the \noffsite visit were documented as underst90d by the CYA facility physicians. \n7.  Vaccination records are inadequate and not well documented on a single record. \nA portion of the vaccination history is found in the Database section, and other \ninformation is found in the Public Health section. The vaccination history of \nevery ward should be recorded on a vaccine administration record. Old records \nshould be obtained from parents so that vaccination schedules can be updated. \n8.  Parole revocators receive only a brief questionnaire by a nurse using a \"Transfer \nInformation and Receipt ofUHR\" form. This form is inadequate because it does \nnot update current changes in medical conditions and does not update outstanding \nappointments or laboratory records. \n9.  Intake physical examination forms do not include a section for a medical history \nby a physician.  As a result, this seldom occurs.  The physical examination form \nshould be revised appropriately. \n10. Health record forms are not referenced in the current Institution and Camps \nManual policy manual.  The exception is the Ward Personal Information fonn. \nTransfer of Health Records \nIn the Institutions and Camps Manual, there are policies governing the transfer of health \nrecords. Staff reported that generally, health records are transported with the ward at the \ntime the transfer takes place. There are occasions when the record was not transported \nwith the ward, but this does not appear to be a significant issue. \nConfidentiality of Health Records and Health Information \nIn the Institutions and Camps Manual, there are policies governing the access to and \ndisclosure of confidential medical information (Section 6172). The policies are somewhat \ngeneral. For example, they state that \"Employees ofthe Department or the YPPB may \naccess the health record if the requested information is necessary to perform their jobs\" \nHowever, the policies do not state who makes the determination of the need to know, and \nwho authorizes the release of information. \nAt N.A. ChadeIjian, the staff reported that they provide the correctional staff a list of \nwards that have bloodborne infections such as HIV and hepatitis, by type of disease. \nSince not all wards are tested for all bloodborne infections, in practice this may \nundermine the concept of Universal Precautions, which states that all body fluids are \ntreated as potentially infectious, not just the bodily fluids of infected individuals. \n1112012003  Page 31 \n\n3. Are the CYA's medical and dental records appropriate? \nRecommendations: \n1.  The policy manual section related to the health record should be revised to \nincorporate the following: \na.  Move the problem list to the front ofthe record and require that providers \nupdate it as clinically indicated \nb.  Separate the ward Consent for Treatment form from the Ward Personal \nInformation form \nc.  Revise the contents of the Ward Personal History form to include juvenile \npertinent information \nd.  Dental records should be maintained in the Unified Medical Record at all \ntimes.  Dental staff should periodically review updated medical \ninformation \ne.  Review and consider revision of the vaccination record to incorporate all \nvaccination information on a single form \nf.  Revise the Intake Examination form to include a section for a medical \nhistory. \n2.  Establish policies requiring clinicians to initial and date review of laboratory, \ndiagnostic and consultant reports. \n3.  The CYA HCSD should clarify policies regarding access to the health record, and \nclarification of authority to release confidential medical information. \n1112012003  Page 32 \n\n4. Does the eYA appropriately screen \nincoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \n4. Does the CYA   appropriately screen \nincoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \nConclusion: \nAll newly incarcerated wards and parole revocators are medically screened. This \nscreening, however, is inadequate because the current practice fails to thoroughly \ndescribe the medical conditions of wards, and fails to initiate appropriate treatment plans. \nIn addition: \n•  Intake screening laboratory testing does not conform to contemporary \nstandards of care for adolescents. \n•  Parole revocators receive only updated laboratory tests, and are not physically \nexamined. This should not be a discretionary examination. \n•  Sexually transmitted disease screening is inadequate for maIes. \n•  There is inadequate linkage with referral juvenile detention facilities and \ninadequate acquisition of medical information from civilian providers. \n•  Dental screening is appropriate and adequate for new intakes. \nFindings and Discussion: \nReception Screening \nThe purpose of the medical reception process is to accurately diagnose current and \npotential health problems, and to develop an appropriate treatment plan that serves as a \nblueprint for care throughout the ward's stay in the CYA  . The medical components of the \nCYA   reception process are adequate. However, in practice, we found that medical \nexaminations were cursory and insufficient, and treatment plans inadequate. Medical \ntreatment plans initiated at the reception centers were not consistently implemented. \nWards are admitted to the CYA through one ofthree reception centers: Northern Youth \nCorrectional Reception Center and Clinic (NYCRCC), Southern Youth Correctional and \nReception Center and Clinic (SYCRCC) for males, and V entura Youth Correctional \nFacility (VYCF) for females. \nThe medical reception process consists of the following: \n•  Vital signs, height, and weight \n1112012003  Page 33 \n\n4. Does the eYA appropriately screen \nincoming wards for med;cal and dental \nconcerns? \n•  Visual acuity and hearing screening \n•  Tetanus toxoid, hepatitis A and B vaccinations \n•  Ward Personal Information (medical history) \n•  Voluntary HIV counseling and testing \n•  Laboratory testing (CBC, serum chemistry with liver function tests, urinalysis,) \n•  Communicable disease screening (TB skin testing, syphilis screening, chlamydia \nand gonorrhea for females) \n•  Physical examination \n•  Pap smear and pregnancy testing for females \n•  Dental screen and examination \n•  Mental health screening and examination. \nIn addition, consents for treatment are obtained from all wards age 18 or above. Staff \nattempt to contact parents or guardians to obtain verbal or written consents for \ntreating wards less than 18 years. \nGeneral Issues with CY A Reception Screening \nThe Medical Problem List is not consistently completed and is located in a section ofthe \nrecord that does not make it readily visible to clinicians or nurses. \nThe medical history information is collected by a nurse but not reviewed or validated by \nthe physician conducting the physical examination. At a minimum, the physician should \nreview and validate the medical history information with the ward. For wards with \nsignificant health problems, the physician should independently take a thorough medical \nhistory, which is not currently being done.  Nurses also use a second form labeled the \n\"Intake Questionnaire\" form. Each of these forms results in a nurse-derived medical \nhistory. \nThe existing screening process contains very little preventive educational information for \nthe wards, does not integrate vaccination information into the medical record in a useful \nformat, and does not result in identifying wards who would benefit from preventive \nmedical or counseling services. The Ward Personal Information Form should be modified \nand integrated into the treatment planning for each ward. \nThe actual physical examination of incoming wards is inadequate. Newly incarcerated \nwards receive a physician history and physical. There is a pre-printed physical \nexamination form that physicians use for this purpose. In all of the records that we \nreviewed, the physician history as documented on these pre-printed forms was either \nincomplete or non-existent. Important historical information, if taken, is documented on a \nseparate progress note. In reviewing records, this gives the impression that the physician \nis not taking any history at all. In most cases, physician history was incomplete or not \ndone. \nThe physical examination form is a check-the-box, yes-no type [OlID. This yields \nmindless data entry, and does not result in the physicians following up with impOliant \nand necessary examinations, and occasionally results in inaccurate or incomplete entries. \nAs examples, one ward diagnosed with severe asthma (he had been recently hospitalized) \n1112012003  Page 34 \n\n4. Does the eYA appropriately screen \nincoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \nwho was not stable was listed as having nonnallung examinations and did not even have \na peak flow measurement taken. The rationale for the diagnosis of severe asthma was not \nindicated on the fonn. So, the reviewer is left with documentation that says the ward has \nsevere asthma, but there is no evidence in the history or physical examination that there is \na problem. One ward with a history of a cardiac munnur was listed as having a normal \nheart examination. There are mUltiple examples of this in record reviews. This leaves an \noverall impression that the examinations are not being done at all or are sloppy. \nThere are issues with timeliness of reports that impact the initial evaluation. Wards who \nhave newly or previously positive TB skin tests receive a chest x-ray. However, reports \nmay not be received for 1-3 weeks, which does not assure that active tuberculosis will be \nruled out in a timely manner. \nThere is currently little-to-no collaboration with Juvenile Hall facilities in Los Angeles \nCounty. These facilities have useful and important screening and medical infonnation to \nconvey to health care staff. There are some communications to the Southern facility, but \nthere should be a fonnal and routine linkage to county juvenile facilities that send wards \nto the CY A, so that useful and important medical infonnation can be conveyed in an \nexpeditious manner. This linkage could also be cost effective by reducing redundant \ntesting for individuals for whom testing was perfonned at the Juvenile Halls. \nLaboratory Testing \nReception laboratory screening is meant to screen for those age/gender specific \nconditions that affects the wards coming into the CYA  . The intake blood tests currently \nperformed do not confonn to contemporary standards of care as based on \nrecommendations from the U.S. Preventive Health Services Task Force, and supported by \nconsensus statements of the American Medical Association (Guidelines for Adolescent \nPreventive Services- GAPS). \nCurrently, the CY A perfonns the following tests for all incoming wards: \n•  Complete blood count (CBC) \n•  Chemistry panel (chemistry 19) \n•  Urinalysis (at northern only) \n•  RPR (a screening test for syphilis) \n•  Voluntary HIV test \n•  Mantoux skin test for tuberculosis \nAdditionally, females receive a chlamydia and gonorrhea test, and a Pap smear. Iftheir \nALT (a liver function test) is abnonnal on their chemistry 19 panel, they get a complete \nhepatitis panel, including Hepatitis A, Band C tests. \nSome ofthese tests are unnecessary and should be eliminated because they have \nassociated cost, their use is not supported by evidence, false positive testing will result in \nadditional unnecessary testing, and the testing takes staff time. \n1112012003  Page 35 \n\n4. Does the eYA appropriately screen \nincoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \nSome tests should be added, specifically, chlamydia and gonorrhea testing for males. \nThe following comments address specific testing: \nComplete Blood Count, (CBC). All incoming wards get this test. The only reason to \nutilize this test as a screening test is for iron deficiency anemia. The burden of disease in \nthis population is too low to justify mass screening. Screening, therefore, is oflittle use in \nthe adolescent population. There is fair evidence to support screening for anemia in \npregnant women, but a CBC is included in the CYA   prenatal test requirements. No \nprofessional group recommends mass screening of juveniles with a CBC. The United \nStates Preventive Health Services Task Force gives CBC testing a \"C\" recommendation, \nwhich means that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening. \nCustomarily this test is around $4 a test. We would not recommend mass screening with \nthis test. \nChemistry 19 panel, (Chern 19). A chemistry panel is a group of multiple chemistry tests \nperformed on a blood sample. The only test in this group panel for which there is a \nrecommendation is for total cholesterol. The National Heart Lung and Blood Institutes' \nrecommends screening with a total cholesterol for persons over 20 years once every five \nyears. GAPS recommends that adolescents over 19 be screened for cholesterol at least \nonce. They also recommend that all adolescents whose parents have elevated cholesterol \nor any family history of cardiovascular disease also be screened. GAPS also recommends \nthat all adolescents with any risk factor for cardiovascular disease (smoking, \nhypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, excessive consumption of dietary fat) also be \nscreened at any age. These criteria should be incorporated into an algorithm for intake \nscreening rather than mass screening of all wards with a comprehensive test. \nAt the Ventura facility, wards with an abnormal liver function test (one component test of \nthe chemistry 19 panel) are referred for a complete hepatitis panel. This is unnecessary in \nour opinion. Only hepatitis C testing is useful if chronic hepatitis is suspected. Hepatitis \nA is not useful to screen for as a chronic illness as it rarely causes chronic complications. \nFor persons with modestly elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis A is not recommended. Most \nwards have been vaccinated for hepatitis B at intake and therefore will show evidence of \nantibody. If a ward has been vaccinated for hepatitis B, only hepatitis C testing is useful. \nThe cost of testing for a complete hepatitis panel is around $50 versus approximately $9 \nfor a hepatitis C antibody. \nBased on 2 & 3 above, we would eliminate mass screening utilizing the chemistry panel. \nWe recommend screening wards over 19 years of age with a total cholesterol (using the \nleast expensive testing method), and recommend screening wards with a family history of \nearly heart disease or high cholesterol or with any risk factor for heart disease with a total \ncholesterol. The number screened probably will be 20% of wards or less. Consideration \nshould be given to screening only wards with a history of intravenous drug use for \nhepatitis C, but this should be done by directly testing for hepatitis C (ELISA) only ($8) \nversus screening all wards with a chemistry panel ($8) with a follow up of all abnonnal \nliver functions with a complete hepatitis panel ($54). \n1112012003  Page 36 \n\n4. Does the eYA appropriately screen \nincoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \nA urinalysis test is performed on all wards. There is no evidence for mass screening with \na urinalysis and no professional group recommends routine mass screening with a \nurinalysis. We recommend discontinuing this test. \nMantoux (TB) skin test. The Mantoux skin test is perfonned every time a ward transfers \nto another facility, even ifthe prior test was within a year. Some wards are tested as \nfrequently as a week apart. This is not in keeping with current Centers for Disease \nControl Recommendations. Information on screening and treatment of persons with \ntuberculosis infection and disease in correctional facilities can be located the Centers for \nDisease Control website at http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/tb/pubs/corrections/default.htm. \nThe multiple repeat testing of wards should be eliminated and accurate record keeping of \ntesting that is performed should be instituted. We recommend that wards be tested with a \ntwo-step test at intake and then once annually at the anniversary of their incarceration \nregardless of transfers. Accurate record keeping and linkage with Juvenile Hall facilities \nwill assist in reducing redundant testing. \nSexually Transmitted Disease (STD) screening. The GAPS recommendations include \nscreening sexually active youth (male and female) at whatever age for syphilis (RPR), \ngonorrhea and chlamydia. They also recommend screening all youths with risk factors for \nHIV. HIV testing does appear to be offered, but chlamydia and gonorrhea testing is only \ndone for females. RPR testing for syphilis is being performed for all wards. Chlamydia \nand gonorrhea testing is already being performed at Juvenile Hall facilities, and \nappropriate linkage to other this county system and other county systems who refer to the \nCY A will improve public health data collection as well as reduce cost of testing by \neliminating redundant testing. The addition of STD .screening for males will raise costs. \nBut, this cost increase may be offset by the savings of not doing the unnecessary tests as \nlisted above. \nAll sexually active females should undergo a PAP test. It appears that this is being done. \nVaccination \nVaccination of adolescents is an important preventive and public health measure. \nVaccination histories are being obtained at intake but are sometimes incomplete and are \nrecorded in more than one location in the health record. The vaccination history of every \nward should be recorded on a vaccine administration record. Old records should be \nobtained from parents so that vaccination schedules can be updated. \nAn appropriate fonn for this purpose can be obtained at the web site \nhttp://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2023b.pdf. There is a statewide effort by the California \nDepartment of Health to track immunization histories of children. The California \nStatewide Immunization Infonnation System (SIIS) is a program to improve \nimmunization rates by creating a statewide registry of childhood immunization. The CYA   \nshould ask to participate in this program so that the registry is available at intake facilities \nand that all vaccinations are entered into the registry. \n1112012003  Page 37 \n\n4. Does the eYA appropriately screen \nincoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \nVaccinations should be provided in accordance with the recommendations of the \nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control. Their \nlatest immunization schedule for adolescents can be found at \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtmllmm5204-Immunizational.htm. \nCurrently, the CYA   does not appear to be updating the tetanus vaccine, is not vaccinating \npersons with sickle disease with pneumococcal vaccine, and is not vaccinating high-risk \nwards against influenza. Attention to vaccination should be greater. \nVaccination is provided to wards against hepatitis B. This vaccine is free for some wards \nunder the Vaccine for Children program. All wards that have not yet been vaccinated \nwith hepatitis B should be vaccinated. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act \nrequires that all health-care providers give parents or patient's copies of Vaccine \nInformation Statements before administering each dose of the vaccines listed in the \nschedule. Additional information is available from state health departments and at \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/vis. \nSexually Transmitted Disease and Blood-borne Disease Detection \nSexually transmitted disease screening and blood-borne disease detection is a public \nhealth activity and should be collaboratively developed with public health officials. No \ncurrent arrangements exist with local or statewide departments of health in developing or \ntracking sexually transmitted diseases. Positive test results are reported to the State \nDepartment of Health. \nThe Centers for Disease Control recommends that correctional facilities and local \ndepartments develop written collaborative agreements for tuberculosis. The same should \nbe done for sexually transmitted diseases. In this regard, it makes sense for the CYA   to \nenter into collaborative discussions with the Los Angeles County Department of Health \nor the State of California Department of Health regarding sexually transmitted disease \nscreening and tuberculosis screening. \nMost of the juveniles entering the CYA come from the Los Angeles County juvenile hall \nsystem. Testing done in these institutions does not need to be repeated in the CYA  . Thus, \nthis collaboration would save money overall, if the CYA were to engage in clinically \nappropriate sexually transmitted disease screening. Additionally, juveniles who are \nidentified with a contagious disease at a juvenile hall can get appropriate follow-up in \nCYA facilities. \nWe met with representatives of the LA County STD program and with Dr. Carmel \nKadmka from the LA Juvenile HalL Dr. Kadmka indicated the issue of communication \nbetween the Juvenile Halls and the CY A had been a problem in the past. Senator Burton \nhad initiated a task force on communication issues between the Juvenile Halls and the \nCYA  . There was a list of recommendations, but, according to Dr. Kadmka, nothing \nresulted from these discussions. Dr. Kadmka indicated that there was no participation \nfrom the medical leadership of the CYA   in these meetings. The CYA   sent a nurse to this \nmeeting; physicians never attended. This is a lost public health opportunity for the CY A. \n1112012003  Page 38 \n\n4. Does the eYA appropriately screen \nincoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \nThe CY A performs appropriate screening for sexually transmitted diseases for females. \nHowever, males do not receive screening that is consistent with contemporary standards \nof care. Based on recommendations by the US Preventive Health Service Task Force, \n(the most conservative recommendations), routine screening for syphilis, gonorrhea and \nchlamydia is recommended in selected high-risk male popUlations. The CYA juvenile \npopulation is high risk as evidenced by prevalence statistics from the LA County Juvenile \nHall. According to these statistics, 5.4% of males in the Juvenile Halls tested positive for \nchlamydia, and 14% of females tested positive. At these numbers, both males and \nfemales should be considered high risk and screening for both groups is warranted. \nCurrently, the CYA   screens males only for syphilis. \nA collaborative screening study with a Board of Health group apparently was done in \nNovember 2000 at the Northern Reception Center. CYA   should evaluate this study and \nconsider screening males who have not been previously screened at County facilities for \nchlamydia and gonorrhea. \nMany juveniles housed in the Juvenile Hall system are transferred to the CYA and repeat \ntesting should be avoided by improved communication with the Juvenile Hall system. \nWards entering the CYA   all get an RPR test for syphilis, which is appropriate given the \nhigh-risk nature of the population. Collaboration with the Juvenile Hall facilities could \nreduce redundant testing of wards and improve public health tracking. \nAll wards should be ~valuated for HIV risk by counseling and a questionnaire during the \nintake process. All wards that have risk factors for HIV should be offered an HIV test. It \ndoes appear that wards are screened for HIV in the CYA   on a voluntary basis, but it \nwould be useful to review the content and effectiveness ofthe counseling provided to the \nwards as well as the effectiveness of identifying those at high risk. \nOral Screening and Oral Health Care \nAll new incoming wards currently receive a dental screening examination and a series of \nbitewing x-rays to evaluate the condition of their teeth. This program is appropriate and \nadequate, but should include parole revocators who have not been in the CYA   for a year. \nReception Screening for Parole Revocators \nThe Institution and Camps Manual policy regarding requirements for newly incarcerated \nwards requires a \"complete baseline health evaluation, including a dental examination.\" \nHowever, in practice this policy is not being applied to parole revocators. \nAt NYCRCC and SYCRCC, the reception process described above applies to wards \nnewly admitted to the CY A. However, wards who return as parole revocators receive \nonly a brief questionnaire by a nurse utilizing a \"Transfer Information and Receipt of \nUHR\" form. This form is inadequate because it does not update current changes in . \nmedical conditions and does not update outstanding appointments or laboratory records. \n1112012003  Page 39 \n\n4. Does the eYA appropriately screen \nincoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \nParole revocators do not receive an updated physician history and physical, regardless of \nhow long it has been since the previous admission, and regardless of their physical \ncondition. We were told that parole violators receive a physician review ifthey have a \nmedical problem. However, based on chart review, this happens infrequently. An \nexamination is almost never included for individuals who return as parole revocators. \nPhysicians ostensibly perform chart review only. This has resulted in missed diagnoses \nand missed opportunities to identify serious problems. A physician with the intent of \nupdating the ward's medical condition and preventive screening history should examine \nparole revocators. \nRecommendations: \nGuidelines for Screening \nThe basis of a screening instrument should be the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive \nServices (GAPS) and the United States Preventive Health Services Task Force \n(USPHSTF) guidelines for preventive services. GAPS guidelines were developed by the \nAmerican Medical Association with contributions from a Scientific Advisory Panel \ncomposed of national experts. GAPS information can be found at the following URL \nhttp://www.ama-assn.org/anlaJpub/categoryI1980.html. \nThe USPHSTF is a large panel of physicians and scientists w?rking with support from \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This group was convened to review \nevidence for over 100 common interventions and provide guidance on appropriate \npreventive services. USPHSTF information can be found at \nhttp://www.ahcpr.gov/clinic/cps3dix.htm. A SUbscription to USPHSTF guidelines can be \nobtained for $60. These guidelines are developed by public sector; unbiased consensus \npanels and their recommendations should be incorporated into the screening instrument \nused by the CYA  . \nIn addition, we recommend the following: \n1.  All parole revocators should have an updated medical history and physical exam \nupon arrival.  Testing should be repeated as clinically.indicated. \n2.  Improve the presentation of intake historical information in the medical record. \nEnforce the use of medical problem lists. This form should be visible when the \nrecord is opened. \n3.  Use a standardized immunization record, a copy of which should be provided to \nthe ward upon parole. \n4.  The CYA   should participate in the California Statewide hnmunization \nInformation System. \n11120/2003  Page 40 \n\n4. Does the eYA appropriately screen \nincoming wards for medical and dental \nconcerns? \n5.  Ensure that TB screening x-rays are performed and reported timely. These should \nbe available within 72 hours from identification of a positive tuberculin skin test. \n6.  Separate consent fonns from medical data forms in the medical record. \n7.  Revise the intake history fonn to conform to contemporary standards and based \nupon prevalence of disease in this population. This fonn· should be based on \nrecommendations of the U S Preventive Services Task Force Guide to Clinical \nPreventive Services, 3rd edition (USPHSTF), and the Guidelines for Adolescent \nPreventive Services (GAPS) by the American Medical Association. \n8.  Combine the physician intake history with the examination form. \n9.  Ensure the adequacy of physician intake examinations by regular peer review of \nthis process. \n10. Provide age and gender specific preventive health counseling to wards at intake. \nAppropriate counseling topics should be based on GAPS and the USPHSTF \nguidelines as referenced elsewhere. \n11. Establish ongoing collaborative links and meetings with representatives of the \nJuvenile Hall systems and with the LA County Department of Health and the \nhealth departments of other major cities in areas referring wards to the CYA  . \n12. Modify the laboratory screening panel to conform to recommendations of the \nUSPHSTF and GAPS. \n13. Initiate chlamydia and gonorrhea screening of asymptomatic males at risk who \nhave not been screened at county facilities. \n1112012003  Page 41 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an \nappropriate quality? \nConclusion: \nCYA   policies and procedures, and actual practice do not ensure that wards have timely \naccess to medical care. This is evidenced by: \n•  Lack of medical autonomy \n•  Insufficient ward orientation to health care \n•  Inadequate access to sick call \n•  Inadequate medication administration \n•  Untimely radiology and consultant reports which delay necessary medical care \nFindings and Discussion: \nThe provision of timely access to medical care requires medical autonomy and \ncooperation from security staff. A consistent theme reported by staff throughout our visits \nwas lack of cooperation from security in carrying out medical activities, such as \narranging for wards to be available for medical appointments, emergency evaluations \nafter mace events, appropriately conducting sick call or administering medications to \nwards in a timely and efficient manner. Staff reported that security considerations are so \nhighly valued that delivery of health care services are a far secondary consideration, and \nresult in a lack of custody support and commitment to delivering health services. \nExamples include the following: \n•  At Herman G. Stark, staff reported that when there was a disturbance in one part \nof the facility, all movement of wards is stopped. In some cases, medical staff \nmust report to the disturbance to be available in case of injury. This adversely \naffects the delivery of health care services across the facility. \n•  At Heman G. Stark the medical staff maintain a Mace Log.  From the period of \nJanuary I-February 4, 2003, the log contained the names of270 wards from \ndifferent housing units who were maced by correctional staff.  Macing occurred \non 34 of 35 previous days.  Medical staff report that wards are supposed to be \nshowered as soon as possible after macing and be brought to medical for an \nevaluation.  However, wards are not always showered prior to being brought to \nmedical.  Delays in showering results in chemicals being left on the skin for long \n1112012003  Page 42 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nperiods oftime and in one case caused severe chemical burns on the face of a \nward. \n•  At N. A. Chaderjian, staff reported that when they appear on the housing units to \ndeliver medications or conduct sick call, the correctional staff sometimes ignores \nthem for 10-20 minutes. They reported that if they try to stand up for medical· \ncare, they are retaliated against or called a whiner. \n•  At Ventura YCF, staff reports a lack of cooperation from security to administer \nmedications in a timely manner in the housing units. \n•  The CMO at one facility complained of security interference with medical \ndecision-making. At that facility, the superintendent made it clear to the physician \nthat the superintendent was in charge. This CMO did not have the autonomy to \nmake medical decisions, including decisions about off-site medical care. \n•  At another facility, the CMO felt that the ability of physicians to have autonomy \nin medical decision-making depended on the Superintendent. He indicated that he \nwould \"feel nervous\" if the cutrent Superintendent left. \n•  At the Preston and Stark facilities, the physicians were extremely passive and \nendured or encouraged bad practices that resulted from strict, high security \nenvironments. As an example, one physician who had worked at the facility for \n25 years did not know whether inmates were permitted to keep inhalers on their \nperson. He stated that\"the number one priority was security and that sometimes \nthis conflicted with medical treatment. This type of passivity does not foster \nautonomy in medical decision-making. \nAccess to Care \nIn addition to cooperation from security staff, adequate access to health care requires that \nthe following elements be in place: \n•  Orientation of wards to health services upon arrival \n•  Sick call with examination in an appropriate clinical setting, including wards in \nsegregation \n•  Laboratory and diagnostic testing \n•  Access to pharmaceuticals \n•  Hospital and specialized ambulatory care \n•  Secondary care (CTC or OHU) \n•  Continuity of medical care following intrasystem transfer \nEach of these elements is discussed below. \n1112012003  Page 43 \n\n5. Do wards have appro!>riate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nOrientation for Wards to Access Health Services \nThe method of orientation of wards to health services varies per facility. In most \nfacilities, wards are verbally oriented to health care services by correctional or health care \nstaff, with no written material provided. At Herman G. Stark YCF, nurses conduct verbal \norientation weekly on Thursday, even if the ward arrives on Monday. There are no \nwritten materials available in English or Spanish to be distributed to wards. \nNCCHC Standards (Y-33) requires that information about the availability of health care \nservices must be communicated orally and in writing to juveniles in a form and language \nthey understand, within 24 hours of their arrival at the facility. \nSick call \nThe primary mechanism for access to health care is the sick call system. The current \nCYA policies do not address access to sick call. NCCHC Standard (Y -39) requires that \nqualified health care providers should conduct sick call in a clinical setting according to \nthe number of juveniles in the facility. In facilities with> 100 juveniles, sick call should \nbe conducted 5 days per week. In addition, NCCHC Standard (Y-38) requires that \njuveniles should be given an opportunity to submit sick call requests daily. \nReview of actual practice showed that in most facilities, sick call is conducted for each \ndormitory, 1 to 5 days per week. For example: \n•  At NYCRCC, the ward orientation manual states that sick call is conducted \nthree days a week in each living unit. In actual practice, sick call is conducted \nonce weekly for each living unit. In the Cheyenne unit, according to a \ncorrectional officer who works both day and evening shift each week, sick call \nis conducted on Tuesday. Wards must sign up for sick call on Saturday or \nSunday. In the Seminole unit, according to correctional officers and wards, \nsick call is conducted on Thursday, and wards must complete a sick call \nrequest form on Wednesday evening. We interviewed one ward that \ncomplained that sick call was offered only once weekly. \n•  At Preston YCF sick call is conducted twice weekly. \n•  At Ventura YCF sick call is conducted twice weekly for males and three times \nweekly for females. \n•  At Southern YCRCC sick call is conducted five days a week. \nAt most facilities, wards obtain access to sick call by completing a sick call request form \nprovided by the correctional officers. Correctional officers are responsible for ensuring \nthat adequate numbers of sick call request forms are present in the dormitory. \nCorrectional officers collect completed sick call request forms, which does not permit \nconfidentiality of the wards' complaint. The sick call request forms are submitted to the \n1112012003  Page 44 \n\n---------\n----_ .... -\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nhealth care unit and triaged by the nurses. At NYCRCC, wards are only permitted to sign \nup for sick call once weekly. This does not ensure appropriate access. \nNurses usually conduct sick call, except at H.G. Stark where the physicians and the nurse \npractitioner conduct it. Examinations are not performed in a confidential setting with \nadequate lighting, medical equipment, and with access to handwashing following \nexaminations. With the exception ofH.G. Stark, health care records are not routinely \nbrought to the living units to be available for the sick call evaluations. This does not \npermit the staff to evaluate the medical complaint in light of recent, potentially related \ncomplaints. The sick call evaluation is documented on the request form that is placed in \nthe record. \nAt NYCRCC, sick call is conducted in satellite examination rooms in the dormitories. \nWe inspected the examination rooms in two of six dormitories. Each room contained an \nexamination table, sink, soap and paper towels, two chairs, locked cabinet containing one \nor two over-the-counter products, and a cabinet with a few supplies such as gloves, \ntongue depressors, etc. According to the nursing staff, additional examination equipment \n(stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, otoscope, etc.) is brought to the area when sick call is \nconducted. \nAt Ventura YCF, in the Specialized Counseling Program (SCP) dormitory, there is a \nrenovated closet that is being used as a satellite medication room, but not for sick call. , \nNurses are asked by security to go to the ward's individual room to examine the wards, \ndespite the availability ofthe clinic room in the immediate area. The clinic room from \n·which medications are passed is a cramped and cluttered space. There is some medical \nequipment such as a scale, otoscope, and ophthalmoscope. However, no exam table is \npresent and the room is not used for examination for security reasons. Dr. Susan Clay \nreported that she has discussed renovation of the rooms with security but has not received \nsupport and cooperation regarding this and other matters. \nThe CYA   has no policies or practices for the health evaluation of juveniles placed in \nsegregation. Due to the possibility of injury and depression during periods of isolation, \nNCCHC Standards (Y -40) require that when juveniles are placed in segregation, \ncorrectional staff must notify health care staff immediately, so that the wards' health \nrecord can be reviewed to determine if any known contraindications to segregation exist. \nAll juveniles placed in segregation (including protective custody) should be evaluated \ndaily by qualified health care professionals. The health care provider should document \nthese checks on a log or. cell card, and any health care provided should be documented in \nthe juveniles' health record. None of these practices exist in the CYA  . \nPharmaceuticals \nGenerally, all classes of medication are available to wards in the CYA  . However, notable \nexceptions include a lack of appropriate pain medication at one facility, and lack of \n1112012003  Page 45 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \naccess to asthma medication at many facilities. We evaluated the PharmacylMedication \nAdministration services the following manner: \n•  Interviewing the pharmacists and nurses responsible for administering \nmedications \n•  Inspecting the medication administration room and pharmacy \n•  Reviewing the controlled substances and standard ward inventory (SWI) \naccountability \n•  Observing medication administration process \n•  Reviewing medication administration records (MARs) \nThe State of California has a statewide contract with McKesson for wholesale purchase \nof pharmaceuticals. Each facility employs an in-house pharmacist on a full or part-time \nbasis to procure and dispense medications (except Preston CYF). Most facilities stated \nthat they have a licensed pharmacy or drug room. We could not verify this for all \nfacilities.  The CYA policies reference an approved Youth Authority Formulary, however \nin actual practice, there is no adherence to a statewide formulary. \nAs a general comment, the manner in which pharmaceuticals are procured, inventoried, \nand dispensed in the CY A is inefficient and wasteful. Examples of the inefficiency and \nwaste of the system include the following: \n•  At the NYCRCC, population 334, a full-time pharmacist is employed, working 4 \nten-hour days. The pharmacist dispenses medication twice a week (Tuesdays and \nThursdays) for each patient prescription via a cassette replacement system. This \nmeans for every 30-day prescription, the pharmacist dispenses medications 8 \ntimes a month (i.e., twice weekly), rather than dispensing the amount prescribed \nonce (up to 30 days). \n•  At the Northern California Youth Correctional Center in Stockton, the pharmacist \ndispenses medication daily, via a cassette system. \n•  At Herman G. Stark, the pharmacist fills the prescription for one week at a time. \nThis practice is extremely labor intensive and inefficient. \n•  At the SYCRCC, the pharmacist is employed part-time, working four 5-hour \ndays. She dispenses few prescriptions. The nurses stated that they administer the \nmajority of medications from large stock bottles. Upon inspection, the cabinets in \nthe medication rooms contained large bottles of medications containing thousands \nof doses of medication. Although the administration by nurses of single doses of \nmedication from a stock bottle is permissible in some states, the practice of \nhaving nurses administer virtually all medication doses from a stock bottle is \nhighly unusual and can lead to medication errors on the part of the nurse. In \naddition, it raises the question as to what the pharmacist actually does during the \n20 hours worked each week. We interviewed the pharmacist who denied that the \n1112012003  Page 46 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nnurses administer most medications from stock bottles. She indicated that this was \ndone only recently because she was on vacation for three weeks. However, ihe \nlarge inventory of stock medications stored in two rooms located next to the OHU \nand in the Intensive Treatment Program (ITP) dormitory support the information \nthe nurses conveyed. \n•  Inventory control of pharmaceuticals is virtually non-existent at most facilities we \nvisited. The pharmacists use an automated pharmacy program (CIPS) to log \nprescriptions. Though this system apparently has the capability to produce some \nutilization reports, none of the facilities we visited review aggregate pharmacy \ndata with an eye toward utilization. Some pharmacists (Northern Reception) did \nnot even understand what the reports meant. No facility was capable of producing \nan inventory of stock medication. None of the facilities could provide reliable \ncosts for pharmaceuticals and the breakdown of categories of pharmaceuticals \nbeing used. The lack of cost data is important, because, in general, there was \nexcessive stock at several ofthe facilities we visited, particularly at Southern, \nPaso Robles, and Stark. We estimate conservatively that there is excess stock of \nover $400,000 statewide. Because there is no inventory control of stock, it is not \npossible to evaluate whether loss of medication is occurring. In addition, we \nfound frequent examples of expired medication in pharmacy rooms. This practice \nresults in waste and increases cost unnecessarily. \n•  At EI Paso de Roblas YCF, the pharmacy contained boxes and bags of \nmedications stored on the floor.  Many ofthe medications had expired, or were \nabout to expire. \n•  When wards transfer from facility to facility, dispensed medications are not \ntransferred with the ward. Because the medication cannot be legally administered \nto another ward, it should be returned to the pharmacy or destroyed. However, at \nPreston Youth Correctional Facility, the medication room contained bottles of \nmedications of wards who had left the facility, but whose medication was being \nadministered to newly arriving wards that had been prescribed the same drug. \nGiven that some of the medications are extremely expensive (e.g., Zyprexa, which \ncost $400-$800 per bottle), it is understandable that the nurses wanted to use the \nmedication rather than waste it. However, it is not legal to do so. \n•  At most facilities, the pharmacist assumes no responsibility for checking \nexpiration dates of medications stored in crash carts and satellite locations outside \nthe pharmacy. For example, at Herman G. Stark YCF, several expired \nmedications were found in the SWI in the housing units (injectable solu-cortef) \nand main medical unit refrigerator (compazine, Wycillin injectable, and \nSulfacetamide ophthalmic solution). The chief pharmacist and nurses \nacknowledge this as a problem. However, the chiefphmmacist states she is not \nresponsible for the medications once they leave the pharmacy. \n1112012003  Page 47 \n\n. 5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \n•  There is no pharmacy or nursing accountability system for inventories of stock \nmedications that are kept outside the pharmacy. The pharmacists do not require \nthat the nurse document to whom each dose is administered, to provide an \naccounting for all medications. This leaves the system vulnerable to theft on a \nlarge scale. When discussed with individual pharmacists, they indicated that they \ndid not have enough staff to maintain such accountability systems. \n•  In contrast, the pharmacist at Herman G. Stark requires the nurses to sign out \ndispensed medication when the medication is taken to the housing units. The \npharmacists and nurses jointly count the medication pill by pill, in each dispensed \npackage. The pharmacist and nurses stated that this system was instituted because \nof discrepancies in what the pharmacy dispenses and what nurses receive. \n•  There is a satisfactory accountability system at most facilities for Drug \nEnforcement Agency (DEA) controlled substances. These substances were kept in \ndouble-locked cabinets, with the exception of Herman G. Stark, where these \nmedications were located in an unlocked cabinet. \n•  At the Preston facility there is no pharmacist. The doctor writes the prescription \non a pad and the prescription is delivered to the lone pharmacy and the pharmacist \nfills the medication from stock at the facility. The only verification on the record \nis the doctor's note and the MAR that is transcribed by a nurse. The pharmacy \ndoes not print out MARS. \n•  Prescription forms are not uniformly utilized in the CYA  . Therefore, the only \ndocumentation of record for a prescription may be the medical progress note. \nDocumentation of prescriptions is inadequate. There is neither acceptable policy \nnor practice in this area. \nMedication Administration \nThere is no existing policy to guide the practice of medication administration. As a result, \nsites have developed unique practices, many of which are inappropriate and unsafe. \nMostly, nurses perform medication administration, but in some situations, untrained \nofficers perform this function. \nIn the CYA, there are three primary mechanisms to administer medications to wards: \n•  One mechanism is a centralized system in which general population wards \ncome to a central area where a nurse administers the medication from a \nmedication room. \n•  In the second mechanism, nurses carry medication to the housing units. In \nlockdown units, the nurses deliver the medications. \n•  The third mechanism is for officers or correctional youth counselors to \nadminister medication. This practice varies from site to site, is unsupervised, \nand is inappropriately done. \n1112012003  Page 48 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an  appropriate quality? \nAt NYCRCC, wards do not carry any identification on their person, thus nurses cannot \nconfirm the identity or ID number of the ward. This may result in a ward receiving the \nmedication of another ward, either because two wards have the same or similar name, or \none ward could pose as another. Nurses reported that recently, a ward requested the \nmedication of another ward. Fortunately, a correctional officer correctly identified the \nward, and he was not given medication. However, the lack of identification could result \nin this occurring again. \nThe nurse pours the psychotropic medications from stock bottles in advance of the ward \ncoming to medication administration. This is called pre-pouring and is not an acceptable \npractice. If the ward does not pick up the medication, it is poured back. Other \nmedications are in unit dose containers and are opened at the time of administration. The \nnurse does not document administration at the time the medication is given, but waits \nuntil the end, then checks to see whose medication is left. This is not acceptable nursing \npractice. The nurse performs oral cavity checks on the wards following medication \nadministration. \nAt SYCRCC, medication is administered from a centralized medication room adjacent to \nthe OHU. It is cluttered and cramped. The floors and cabinet doors are not clean. The \nnurses reported that orderlies are not permitted to come into the medication room and that \nnurses are responsible for keeping it clean. There was a schedule of cleaning activities \nposted, but it consisted primarily of keeping countertops clean, and not terminal cleaning \nofthe floors, walls and other surfaces. \nThe medication administration process at SYCRCC was observed. The nurse stated he \npre-pours medications from large stock bottles, and that if the ward does not appear for \nmedication administration he destroys the medication. This practice is wasteful, \nparticularly for expensive psychotropic medications such as Zyprexa, Risperdal and \nGeodon. Wards present themselves at the window with a picture ID card that permits the \nnurse to verify the identity of the ward. The nurse did not use the Medication \nAdministration Record (MAR) to verify the medication at the time the medication was \nadministered, which may lead to errors. Documentation of medications took place at the \nend of medication administration instead of at the time of administration.  In addition, at \nSYCRCC, according to the Supervising Nurse, all psychotropic medications are crushed, \nincluding sustained release medications. The practice of crushing sustained-released \nmedications defeats the purpose of these time-release medications more expensive \nmedications. \nIn some facilities, nurses transfer medications from legally dispensed and properly \nlabeled containers to small manila envelopes that are not properly labeled.  This is not a \nlegal practice and should be discontinued. \nWe reviewed the MARs. In general, they were legible and complete, and contained \nsignatures of nurses who administered medications. However, the nurses did not employ \na uniform process for transcribing orders, or for indicating a medication was changed or \n1112012003  Page 49 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \ndiscontinued. This resulted in some MARs appearing disorganized and in some cases \nillegible. For example, a nurse crossed out discontinued medications with a magic marker \nthat often obliterated the medication name, dose, and prescribing information. \nDocumentation of changes in, or discontinuation of medication should not result in \nobliteration of any information on the MAR, which is a legal document. At Preston\" dates \nof medications were written in pencil and then changed if the medication was renewed. \nAt Chad, MARS for psychotropics and other nurse-administered medication is kept in a \nbook in the health care unit. Correctional Youth Counselors (YCC's) administer all other \nmedications, including antibiotics, antihypertensive medications, etc. Some the \ncounselors reported that they had received no medication administration training.  All \nother MARS are kept in the housing units with the correctional staff. Inspection of \nseveral of these MARS showed that many spaces were blank, which indicates that the \nward did not receive the medication, or received the medication but it was not \ndocumented. Once these MARS are completed, they are forwarded to the pharmacy, but \nare not filed in the health record. The result is that there is no documentation in the record \nthat the ward received the medication.  Thus health care staff lacks knowledge regarding \nwhether the ward is actually getting his medication. One of the experts asked Dr. Lai how \nhe knows that wards are getting the medication that is prescribed. He replied that he only \nknows by asking the ward. This is unacceptable practice. Dr. Lai says that for renewal of \nmedication for chronic disease, wards must place a sick call request. \nAt Ventura YCF, medication is administered on the units. In the Specialized Counseling \nUnit, there is a half door through which medications could be passed. This would present \nan ideal opportunity for the efficient administration of medication. However, the nurses \nreport that instead of having the wards line up at the window where the nurses could \nreview the MAR, prepare the medication, and administer it to the patient, security staff \nrequires the nurses to go door-to-door. \nTo administer medications, the nurse empties the unit dose medications into a small \nmanila envelope. The nurse then crushes the psychotropic medications. Some patients. \nrefuse their medications because they are crushed and mixed together. The nurse places \nthe envelopes in a carrying cart and walks down the hall door-to-door. The correctional \nofficer opens the door, and the nurse gives the ward a cup who fills it up with water in the \ncell. The ward then takes the medication with the nurse present. This is a cumbersome \nsystem. \nSupervision of Pharmacists and the Pharmacy Program \nThe work hours of pharmacists is related more to their availability than to facility need. \nAt several facilities, there is either no pharmacist coverage or coverage is part-time and \numeliable. In addition, there is no statewide oversight of pharmacists, no performance \nmeasures for phamlacists, and no reporting requirements. Phamlacy and Therapeutics \nCommittee meetings occur, but are chaired by a physician without experience in \nmanagement. Chief Medical Officers ostensibly supervise the pharmacists, but, based on \ninformation available in their credential files, they lack experience in pharmacy \n1112012003  Page 50 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nmanagement. As a result, pharmacists are left to supervise themselves. This was the \nimpression given to us in interviews with individual pharmacists. Each facility, therefore, \nhas developed unique inventory control systems and unique methods for distributing and \npackaging medication. Because there is no management supervision, the role ofthe \npharmacist at individual facilities may be the subject of dispute between the pharmacist \nand nursing staff. \nAccess to Medication \nGenerally, wards have access to prescribed medication. There were some significant \nexceptions. \nThe first involves the treatment of pain, particularly at the Preston facility. At Preston, the \nCMO, as a matter of practice, does not utilize narcotic pain medication in the treatment of \npain. He admitted to one ofthe experts that he has not prescribed narcotic medication at \nthe facility since 1989. This came up when we discovered in our audit that no narcotics \nwere stored at the facility. The physician described to one of the expert reviewers that he \nnever used narcotics based on his adamant belief not to use narcotics for this population. \nOne ward at that facility with sickle disease was therefore not treated with appropriate \nnarcotic medication during an acute sickle crisis. These episodes are extremely painful \nevents and require narcotic type pain medication for appropriate care. In addition, there \nhave been wards with fractures at this facility. Not to treat these groups with narcotic pain \nmedication, when necessary, is unprofessional conduct, unethical, and cruel. This \npractice should be stopped immediately as a matter of principle. The state of California \nMedical Board has guidelines in the treatment of pain that should be evaluated in review \nof current CYA practices. (See http://www.medbd.ca.gov/consumerguidelines.htm.) The \nfact that such a practice exists is evidence of the lack of supervision of medical staff. \nThe second exception to adequate access to medication involves the treatment of asthma. \nAsthma is the most common chronic medical condition for wards in the CYA  . Use of \nmaintenance inhalers (steroid inhalers) is not a generally accepted practice at all facilities. \nFor example, at Preston, steroid inhalers are not used as a matter of practice. This is \ninappropriate care that is not in keeping with contemporary standards of care. In addition, \nwhen rescue inhalers are prescribed, wards are not permitted to keep these items on their \nperson resulting in periods when they are untreated and dependent on security officers for \naccess to medication. \nSome facilities permit wards to keep this medication on their person. This decision is \nmade by correctional staff or is a matter of historical practice. At Stark, for example, the \nTreatment Team Supervisor is a correctional officer who decides whether wards can keep \ninhalers on their person. This is not a legally or medically prudent practice and results \nfrom a lack of physician autonomy in medical decision-making. All wards with moderate \nasthma or recent attacks should have keep-on-person access to medication. \n11120/2003  Page 51 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nThe third exception involves an unusual directive by Dr. Wheaton. He prohibited the \npractice of prescribing \"as needed\" medication. This is a standard and necessary practice \n.i n medical practice. The memo detailing this prohibition provides no rationale for this \npractice. Typically, PRN medication is used for many pain medications as well as f()r \nasthma inhalers. This directive places all of the physicians in a position of being unable to \nappropriately prescribe multiple different types of medication in a medically appropriate \nmanner. \nFormulary Issues \nWhile there is a formulary in place for the CYA  , no institution we visited actually used \nthe formulary in routine practice. When individual facilities send non-formulary requests \nto the Central Office, they never get an approval in return. As a result, no one takes \nfonnulary issues seriously. In general, pharmacists order any medication prescribed by \nthe CMO. Pharmacists do not participate in the non-formulary process. Non-formulary \nutilization of medications is not tracked. \nA drug formulary is useful to provide an acceptable range of medications that are \nnecessary to routinely treat the population in question. Cost factors in choosing which \nmedications to include on the formulary are important considerations. Updating \nfonnularies and monitoring compliance with formularies was a recommendation of the \nState of California Auditor in its publication, State of California: Its Containment of \nDrug Costs and Management ofM  edications for Adult Inmates Continue to Require \nSignificant Improvements. This is not occurring in CY A facilities. \nIn general, when formularies are in place, a physician still can use any required drug by \nplacing a non-formulary request. Though Central Office leadership told us that this \npractice is in place, there is no policy or practice in place to support this contention. Thus, \nthere is no supervision of provider practice in prescribing medication. \nNarcotic Control and Medication Storage Issues \nControl of narcotics was appropriate at most facilities, except Stark, where narcotics were \nkept in an unlocked cabinet in the clinic room. All narcotics should be maintained in a \ndouble-locked arrangement whether in the clinic or in the medication room. There are \nmultiple areas in clinics and OHU s where medication is stored that are not inspected by a \npharmacist. Only pharmacy rooms have licenses.  . \nThe CYA   should consult with the Board of Pharmacy as to whether the practice of \nstoring large quantities of stock medications, including narcotics, and dispensing these \nmedications outside of a licensed phannacy is appropriate or legal. In addition, \nclarification should be sought regarding inspection requirements, including determining \nthe responsibility of the pharmacist to develop an accountability system for stock supplies \nand check drug expiration. \n1112012003  Page 52 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nAt the Southern facility, the license for the pharmacy is a \"Drug Room Permit.\" This \nroom is actually used as a pharmacy and probably requires a different license. A similar \nsituation may exist at other facilities. CYA   pharmacists define their own role, and do not \noffer assistance or become involved in supervising the storage of medication in clinical \narea outside of the pharmacy. \nDiagnostic Services \nAll facilities had a contract with a reference laboratory for laboratory testing. Some \nlaboratory tests at the Northern reception center are performed on site. There did not \nappear to be a problem with clinical staff getting laboratory results. \nRadiology services are available at all sites, but there are administrative problems that \nresult in untimely services. Specifically, wards with fractures do not often get timely x \nrays.  At Preston, Stark, and Chad it takes about a week or longer to get an x-ray \nreviewed by a radiologist. This is not timely, since most films are taken to rule out \nfractures. X-rays to rule out fractures should be taken and reviewed within 24 hours. \nAt Stark and Preston, the doctors read their own films and only selectively send films out \nfor radiology over-read. This isn't appropriate. All films should be over-read by a \nradiologist. \nAt the Stark facility a portable x-ray unit is used. This unit is not inspected and staff does \nnot use appropriate shielding or monitoring when x-rays are taken. An officer station is \nadjacent to the area where films are taken. Persons in proximity to x-ray exposure should \nbe monitored for radiation exposure. \nWe were asked whether new radiology equipment should be purchased. In our opinion, \nexisting equipment should first be inventoried. A licensed and reliable radiology \nequipment maintenance contractor should service all equipment and provide an opinion \nabout each piece of equipment's serviceability and obsolescence. Then a utilization of \nservices should be completed. How many films are taken per day? Once that data is \navailable, it should become clearer regarding whether new equipmen~ is needed. \nHospital and Specialized Ambulatory Care \nThere are adequate arrangements at all sites with local hospitals and specialists for \nhospital and off-site specialty care. The Institutions and Camps Manual defines the \nUtilization Review process. This is a process to ensure appropriate use of health care \nservices and resources. Staff physicians must complete a request for offsite care and \nsubmit it to the CMO at each facility. CMO's by policy decide whether the offsite request \nis approved, or whether a subsequent review occurs with Central Office staff. \nNot all physicians or CMO's are aware of this policy, and referrals off-site do not occur \nin a standardized fashion. Each site has its own unique referral process largely dependent \n1112012003  Page 53 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nupon the CMO and Superintendent. The Central Office could not produce any list or log \nof cases that had been reviewed on a statewide basis. Off-site requests are not fonnally \ndocumented on an off-site request form in a standardized manner. There is no fonnal \npractice of providing information to the consultant for their evaluation of the ward. Nor is \nthere a formal process for obtaining infonnation from the consultant regarding \nevaluations of wards. \nThere is no prioritization for necessity of off-site medical problems. It was difficult to \nevaluate timeliness of offsite care because there is a lack of offsite tracking at most sites. \nFor those sites that do track off-site visits, review of off-site trip sheets and medical \nrecords revealed that there were several wards whose condition required an urgent off \nsite trip rather than an elective one and there were several wards whose off-site care was \nnot timely. For example: \n•  A ward with a week-old metacarpal fracture was not sent to an orthopedic \nsurgeon for five days. A delay of this extent may result in mal-union of the \nfracture. \n•  A ward with a history of esophageal stricture was unable to swallow. It took \n34 days to see a gastroenterologist to evaluate for dilation. His weight was not \nmonitored in the interim period. This is an unacceptable delay. \n•  A ward waited 15 days to see an ophthalmologist to evaluate a possible retinal \n, tear. This is an unacceptable timeframe in which to evaluate a retinal tear and \nplaced the ward at risk for loss of vision. \n•  A ward waited 13 9ays to evaluate a hand fracture. This is unacceptable and \ncould result in mal-union. \n•  A ward that had an echocardiogram scheduled didn't have it done for two and \na half months upon which time he was transferred. The institution to which \nthe ward was transferred did not complete the appointment and the \nappointment was lost to follow up. \n•  A ward with papillary carcinoma ofthe thyroid had a recommendation from \nan oncologist for follow up testing. The testing and follow up were not done. \nThe CYA   physician note states, \"Treatment and test apparently are cancelled \nor delayed because of insurance issues.\" This is inappropriate follow up. Care \nfor wards should not be denied based on their medical insurance status. \n•  A physician referred a ward for surgery for a hernia on November 8, 2002. A \nsubsequent note in the medical record stated, ''when consult dated 1118/02 has \nbeen scheduled, will post to UHR.\" A physician saw the ward on December \n20,2002 and the doctor's note recommended \"reassurance.\" He was never \nscheduled for the evaluation of his hernia. There was no explanation as to why \nthe surgical consult was not completed. \n•  A ward developed abdominal pain on February 16, 2002 and was sent to a \nlocal emergency room. The pain continued and the CMO recommended on \nApril 26, 2002 that a gastroenterology consultation be obtained. On July 13, \nthe appointment was scheduled for September 10. The gastroenterologist \n1112012003  Page 54 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nrecommended a radiographic procedure that was done December 13. This is \nan excessive delay for a work up. As well, the follow up ofthe patient at the \nfacility was poor. \n•  A ward saw an optometrist at one of the facilities on December 3,2001. The \nnurse note connected with this visit stated, \"need referral to outside \nophthalmologist secondary to high lOPs.\" lOP stands for intra-ocular pressure \nand can be a sign of glaucoma. Failure to appropriately treat glaucoma can \nresult in loss of vision. The patient went offsite on January 11, 2002 and \nreturned with a recommendation for further testing (visual field examination) \nbefore the ophthalmologist saw the patient again. The ward returned to the \nophthalmologist on March 18, but the note said that he never had his visual \nfield test completed. He went for visual field testing on March 28, 2002. On \nJune 25,2002 the medical record clerk noted that the follow up \nophthalmology appointment was yet to be scheduled. In the meantime the \npatient continued to be followed by the onsite optometrist, who referred to an \nophthalmologist on September 19,2002, because the intra-ocular pressures \nwere getting higher. A follow up note documented that, \"as per computer info, \nthis ward is on pending list. Awaits appointment date.\" This care is careless \nand places the ward at risk for loss of vision. \n•  A ward with hepatitis C was referred to a gastroenterologist on February 25, \n2002 but didn't go for the appointment until December 2, 2002, a period of 9 \nmonths. This is an excessive delay. The gastroenterologist ordered a liver \nbiopsy, which was done on December 24, 2002. Apparently, the test was \ndone, but there was no documentation of the results in the record as of \nFebruary 3, 2003. \nWhen wards do go off-site for care, we could seldom identify that the results of the \noffsite visit were documented as understood by the CYA   facility physicians. \nExamples of this include the following: \n•  A ward was hospitalized for a seizure and cardiac arrhythmia. There was no \ndocumented evidence in the record that the physician understood what had \ntranspired in the hospital for this patient. \n•  A ward hospitalized in the intensive care unit for life-threatening asthma \nreturned to the facility with medication orders from the hospital. The CY A \nfacility physician changed the orders without explanation, and did not \ndocument understanding of what had transpired at the hospital. \n•  A ward was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism at the Southern facility. He was \nsent to an endocrinologist and was followed appropriately for four visits. The \nendocrinologist recommended medication. The recommendation also \nindicated that if the medication did not work as intended, the ward would need \nradioactive iodine treatment. At the last visit, a 3-month follow up was \nrecommended. The patient was transferred to the Preston facility and follow \nup of this patient never occurred. After transfer to Preston, the patient had \n1112012003  Page 55 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \nlaboratory test evidence that he was either overmedicated or that he no longer \nneed medication. Nevertheless, the medication was continued for 8 months. \nThe physician didn't appear to understand how to treat the ward and yet the \nward was not sent to see the endocrinologist. \n•  A ward sustained ajaw fracture as a civilian on February 27, 2003 and had \nsurgery with insertion of a plate on February 28. He was incarcerated on \nMarch 18,2003. A dentist noted that he had an infection in the area ofthe \nfracture. The patient went to University of Southern California Hospital on \nMarch 19,2003. However, there is no report ofthis visit in the record, and no \nfollow up monitoring ofthe patient. On April 16,2003, penicillin was started \nwithout a documented explanation. On April 23, 2003, a note in the medical \nrecord states, \"Dr. Moose from USC called and informed us that ward is to be \nscheduled for surgery to remove a plate placed 8 weeks ago in his mandible. \nThe bur plate is source oflow grade infection.\" The CYA physicians did not \ndocument understanding of what was occurring to the patient. \n•  A gastroenterologist recommended stool guiac testing for a ward that had \nbeen evaluated for abdominal pain. There was no follow-up at the facility. \nPhysicians at the Stark facility described interference by the Superintendent in sending \nwards off-site for care. Given that most sites do not track off-site events, it is not possible \nto describe whether this occurs with any regUlarity. \n·Correctional Treatment Centers \nBeginning in 1987, the California Health and Safety Code section 1250 required that \nwards who need professionally supervised health care beyond that normally provided in \nthe community on an outpatient basis, must be treated in a licensed Correctional \nTreatment Center (CTC). The regulation does not regulate outpatient care, specifically \ncare provided in outpatient housing units. As section 1250 of the Health and Safety Code \nspecifies, \"This definition shall not apply to those areas of a law enforcement facility that \nhouses inmates or wards that may be receiving outpatient services and are housed \nseparately for reasons of improved access to health care.\" \nOutpatient housing units are defined in the regulation as special housing for wards whose \n'''condition would not normally warrant admission to a licensed health care facility and \nfor whom housing in the general popUlation may place them at personal or security risk.\" \nIn July 2000, the Youth Law Center petitioned the Superior Court of the State of \nCalifornia to mandate the CYA to comply with licensing requirements of the California \nHealth and Safety Code regulations on CTCs. A judgment entered December 11, 2000 \nand amended June 19,2002, stipulated that CTCs would be licensed in a timeframe as \nfollows: \n•  Stark would be licensed on January 21,2003. \n•  Ventura would be licensed on March 31,2003. \n1112012003  Page 56 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \n•  Northern California Youth Correctional Center licensed by April 30, 2004. \n•  A temporary facility licensed at Southern by August 15,2002. \nIn addition, the CYA was to develop, \"an ongoing case-by-case system to assess the need \nfor inpatient medical care services by July 30, 2002.\" However, to the best of our \nknowledge, there has been no needs assessment for CTC beds for physical health \npurposes. \nIn reviewing the court's decision in the mandate, the following statement is made, \"The \nCYA   provides inpatient medical and mental health services in 11 facilities that come \nwithin the statutory definition of a correctional treatment center.\" However, during our \nvisit, we did not find any wards that were candidates for housing in a CTC for reasons \nassociated with physical, as opposed to mental, health. Nor did we identify physical \nhealth treatment that rose to the definition of need requiring a CTC. \nOf the 33 charts reviewed, only 3 would have been candidates for a CTC at some time \nduring their incarceration. During our entire visit to 6 facilities, we did not encounter a \nsingle individual who would have been a candidate for a CTC during the time of our \nvisit. Excluding mental health conditions, use of existing Outpatient Housing Units \n(ORUs) would suffice for most wards with medical requirements. (See the following \nsection on \"Outpatient Housing Units.\") In fact, most wards housed in the ORUs do not \nhave serious medical conditions that require 24 hour nursing. The most common use of \nORUs, at Northern Reception for example, is for suicide watch. Excluding mental health \nneeds, most OHU admissions were for holding a person requiring fasting prior to a next \nday test. Following that, patients were placed in the OHU for observation after minor \nprocedures. None of the cases reviewed on this log required 24-hour nursing supervision. \nAt Chad, all ofthe wards housed in the OHU were there because of healing fractures that \nfavored protected housing. For all ofthese individuals, ifthey were civilians they would \nhave been sent home. For physical health, as opposed to mental health, therefore the need \nfor CTCs in the CYA   is minimal. \nBecause of their age, adolescents do not have high rates of chronic debilitating disease \nthat requires continual medical monitoring. Adolescents are in relatively good health \ncompared to adults. According to McAnarney's Textbook ofA  dolescent Medicine, acute \nnonfatal injuries account for the largest ·number of hospital days. In the CYA  , while these \ninjuries are treated in hospitals when indicated, the recuperative phase can be managed in \nsettings similar to ORUs. Also, according to McAnamey, \"Adolescents are more likely to \nbe hospitalized for psychiatric conditions than are any other age group.\" Thus, the CTC \nrequirements are greater for mental than for physical health and this is where the \nemphasis for CTCs should be. \nWhile the current need for CTC beds for physical health is minimal, the Central Office \nleadership has devoted virtually all of its working time and effort in establishing these \nunits to the neglect of higher clinical priority areas. In addition, the entire organization of \nthe medical staff and the clinical program has been designed on a model based on the \nCentral Office leadership's interpretation ofCTC requirements. A well-functioning \n1112012003  Page 57 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \noutpatient medical program, including well run ORUs, are what the wards of the CYA \nneed. Instead, Central Office leadership devotes its entire energies to designing the entire \nmedical program for the CYA as if it were a CTC. This may be a resUlt of inexperience \nof the Central Office leadership in managing correctional health care programs. \nThe current plan for development of CTC beds is sufficient to address the medical needs \nof the wards, provided that the Ventura facility has beds for females. \nOutpatient Housing Units \nORUs function as a level of care below a CTC. According to CYA policies Section 6209, \nthe ORU is to be used to admit any ward who requires more treatment or observation \nthan can be easily performed on a living ~nit to inpatient status (for example, wards \nscheduled for day surgery or wards pending admission to an acute care hospital). Policies \ndo not specify the types of medical and nursing care to be provided in the OHU, nor \nprocedures for admitting, monitoring and discharging patients from the OHO. \nORUs should be governed by policy and procedure in a manner equivalent to infinnary \ncare as defined by the NCCHC. The NCCHC Standard on Infirmary Care (Y -52) requires \nthe following: \n•  Written policy and defined procedures specifying the types of medical and \nnursing care provided in the infirmary. They contain a definition ofthe scope of \nmedical and nursing care provided at the facility infirmary. \n•  A physician is on call 24 hours a day. \n•  A registered nurse who is there daily supervises the infirmary. \n•  Sufficient and appropriate qualified health care professionals are on duty 24 hours \na day. \n•  All juveniles are within site or hearing of a qualified health care professional. \n•  There is a manual of nursing care procedures. \n•  A complete inpatient health record is kept for each juvenile. \n•  Admission to and discharge from infirmary care by order of a physician only (or \nother qualified health care professional where permitted by state law). Actual \npractice is consistent with this policy. \nContinuity of Care Through Intrasystem Transfer \nWards in the CYA   are frequently transferred from facility to facility. It is important \ntherefore, for health care staff to interview the ward regarding current health problems, \nand review of the health record to note the medical history, continue medications, \npreviously ordered laboratory tests, or consultations. \nCYA policies address this subject in the Unified Health Record Section (6169). The \npolicy addresses the actual transfer ofthe health record. The only reference to the health \ncare staff duties is that the physician/dentist will \"review the UHR to determine \nimmediate and future medical, mental health and dental needs.\" The policies do not \n1112012003  Page 58 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \naddress the specific measures to be taken upon arrival. Therefore the actual process varies \nfrom site to site. In addition, medications are not transferred with the wards. This may \nresult in missed medication doses and is wasteful. \nReview of records and interviews with staff confirm that intake practices vary from site \nto site. At all facilities, the nurse completes the \"Transfer and Receipt of Unified Health \nRecord\" form. The form does not contain a space for vital signs or current symptoms, \nalthough the nurse often records this information in the progress notes. \nIn addition to completing the form, at some facilities, the nurse interviews the ward on \nthe day of arrival regarding current medical problems; obtains weight and vital signs; and \nplants a TB skin test. If the ward is on medication, the nurse calls the physician to obtain \na verbal order. Sometimes wards arrive late in the evening without medication and nurses \nreport that they call the physician to obtain a new order for the medication. \nAt other facilities, the nurse only conducts a record review on the day of the ward's \narrival. For example, at Preston YCF, the nurse and physician conduct a record review of \nnewly arriving wards on the day of arrival. Wards arriving from non-reception centers are \nseen on the day of arrival. Wards arriving from reception centers are seen the following \nday. This practice does not make sense. \nProblems associated with intrasystem transfer involve failure to refer wards with medical \nproblems in at timely manner. For example, a ward that arrived at Preston in January \n2003 complained of genitourinary problems. The nurse told the ward to sign up for sick \ncall rather than referring the ward to the physician.  Another ward arrived on numerous \npsychotropic medications including Depakote, Seroquel and Klonipin. The ward's health \nrecord was not reviewed and the UHR transfer form was not completed until the \nfollowing day. \nRecommendations: \n1.  Ensure that physicians have autonomy to practice medicine. \n2.  Revise policies to incorporate sick call procedures that include the following: \na.  Wards are able to confidentially sign up for sick call seven days per week \nb.  Wards have access to sick call a minimum of five days per week \nc.  The health record is present for all clinical encounters \nd.  Sick is conducted in a medical setting with adequate privacy, lighting, \nequipment and access to handwashing facilities, etc. \ne.  Nurses who conduct sick call are trained in health assessment and nursing \n3.  Revise policies to ensure compliance with NCCHC Standards regarding access to \ncare and medical rounds for juveniles in administrative or disciplinary \nsegregation. \n1112012003  Page 59 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an appropriate quality? \n4.  Standardize the contents of emergency bags to include appropriate emergency \nmedications. Audit and inventory these bags on a regular basis. \n5.  Inventory large x-ray and other capital equipment. Service and maintain this \nequipment. \n6.  Improve radiological services so that wards with suspected fractures or other \nurgent conditions could obtain an x-ray with an over-read by a radiologist within \n24 hours. \n7.  Institute tracking of all offsite encounters and monitor the timeliness and \nappropriateness of off-site medical care. \n8.  Create priority rankings for scheduling off-site medical care so that wards with \nserious or urgent medical needs are scheduled for care in a timely manner. \n9.  Review and revise pharmacy policies and procedures to address the following \nareas: \na.  Create, implement and monitor formulary use of medications. \nb.  Eliminate inefficient pharmacy practices such as dispensing medications \ndaily or twice weekly, or having pharmacists and nurses count each pill in \na prescription.  Ideally medications would be dispensed once for the \nprescribed period. \nc.  Establish inventory controls of medications that are stored in or outside \nthe pharmacy. \nd.  Establish pharmacy accountability. for checking expiration dates of \nmedications stored in medication rooms or crash carts. \ne.  Implement training for clinicians regarding appropriate pain management. \nThe HCSD should conduct periodic reviews to monitor for the appropriate \nuse of pain medication. \nf.  Change current rules regarding keep-on-person asthma medication, so that \nwards with asthma have ready access to their inhalers. \ng.  Improve inventory control of pharmaceuticals. \nh.  Standardize the job descriptions ofthe pharmacists and institute \nsupervision for this group. \n1.  The Health Care Services Division should work with custody to arrange \nfor transfer of medications with the wards from facility to facility. \n8.  Establish policy delineating medication administration and standardize practices. \nThese practices should include: \na.  All wards are issued and present a picture identification card that is \npresented at the time of medication administration \nb.  Nurses using the Medication Administration Record at the time of \nadministration to validate physician orders \n1112012003  Page 60 \n\n5. Do wards have appropriate access to \ntimely medical and dental care of an  appropriate quality? \nc.  No pre-pouring of medications or transferring medications from a legally \ndispensed medication to improperly labeled envelopes \nd.  Documentation of medications at the time they are administered \ne.  All medications should be administered by nurses or personnel who have \nbeen trained and demonstrate competency to administer medications \nf.  Medications should be administered from the main clinic or a designated \narea in the dormitories.  Except in lockdown areas, nurses should not be \nrequired to go cell to cell. \ng.

Does the eYA respond appropriately to \nmedical and dental emergencies? \n6. Does the CYA   respond appropriately to \nmedical and dental emergencies? \nConclusion: \nCYA   policies and procedures, and training do not adequately prepare staff to respond to \nemergencIes. \nFindings and Discussion: \nThe current CYA   policies regarding response to medical emergencies (Section 6209) \naddress the following: \n•  Response of nursing staff covering the infirmary in the event of an emergency \nin the in the housing units \n•  Admission of a ward needing further observation, pending admission to an \ninpatient setting or scheduled for day surgery \n•  Psychiatrist review of the health record of newly arriving wards \n•  Emergency care other than wards \n•  Notification of unusual occurrence, serious medical problem, or injury \nThe policies are brief, and do not address orientation and training of correctional or \nhealth care staff regarding emergency response, including first aid and cardiopulmonary \nresuscitation, use of emergency equipment, and emergency drills. In addition, NCCHC \nStandards (Y -42) require that procedures are developed regarding the following: \n•  Emergency evacuation of the juvenile from the facility \n•  Use of emergency medical vehicle \n•  Use of one or more designated hospital emergency department(s) or other \nappropriate health facilities \n•  Emergency on-call physician and dentist services when the emergency health \nfacility is not located nearby \n•  Security procedures that provide for the immediate transfer ofj uveniles when \nappropriate \nThere are no local operating procedures regarding emergency services at CYA   facilities. \nFacilities do not routinely conduct emergency response drills. Emergency equipment \ngenerally consists of an emergency bag, oxygen, and automatic external defibrillator \n(AED). Selected facilities have a crash cart with emergency medications. There is no \nstandardized list of emergency bag contents. \n1112012003  Page 62 \n\n----~ --~--~~-~ \n6. Does the CYA respond appropriately to \nmedical and dental emergencies? \nStaff physicians are on-call after business hours, weekends, and holidays. However, some \nfacilities have no physician back up if the physician is on vacation. In such \ncircumstances, the nurses report that they send the ward to the local emergency room for \nconditions that cannot wait until the physician returns. \nAll facilities have contracts with local area hospitals for emergency care and there have \nbeen no identified problems in getting wards seen in local area hospitals. \nThe health care leadership of the CY A has not developed comprehensive Nursing \nProtocols or a training program for nurses to use in assessing potentially urgent \nconditions. This leads to deficiencies in nursing assessments. At the NYCRCC, a ward \ncomplained to the nurse of chest pain. The nurse obtained vital signs, but did not listen to \nthe patient's heart and lungs. The nurse did not refer the patient to the physician. \nUse of Mace \nMace is used extensively in the California Youth Authority.  At the Heman Stark facility, \nfor the one month of records we reviewed, almost 10 wards a day sustained mace \nexposures.  This is a high rate of mace exposures.  Yet there is no specific medical policy \ngoverning treatment of individuals who sustain mace exposure.  Mace is an irritant gas \nused for its incapacitating effects.  It irritates the skin producing dermatitis, redness and \nsometimes blistering.  The higher the humidity, the greater the severity of skin lesions. \nWith repeated exposures, mace can act as an allergen, producing serious allergic \nreactions with repeated exposure.  Allergic sensitization can affect officers as well as \nwards.  Injury to the eye and irritation of the lung tissue can ·also occur.  Death has been \nreported with prolonged exposure to mace.  Because oil traps mace in the skin, \nindividuals should not wash with soap after exposures.  Removal to fresh air and copious \nirrigation with water should occur. \nThere is no standard procedure guiding the treatment of individuals who sustain mace \nexposure.  As well, according to staff we interviewed, post-exposure medical treatment is \nsubject to security requirements such that not all individuals who are exposed are \npresented to medical for treatment or are presented in a delayed fashion for medical \nevaluation.  Review of the medical records did reveal one individual who appeared from \nhis picture to have sustained 2nd or 3rd degree bums from the effects of mace.  The extent \nof medical complications from mace exposure in the CY A are not known because not all \nwards are brought for treatment, and follow up of those wards who are exposed is not \nthorough or tracked. \nRecommendations: \n1.  CYA   Headquarters should develop and implement policies and procedures that \naddress the following: \n1112012003  Page 63 \n\n----\n_._-_.---_._. \n6. Does the eYA respond appropriately to \nmedical and dental emergencies? \n•  Types of medical equipment (AED, oxygen, emergency bag, etc.) to be \navailable at each facility to appropriately respond to emergencies \n•  How frequently the equipment should be checked by medical staff \n•  Notification of medical and security personnel in the event of an emergency \n(physician on-call, poison control, security staff, etc) \n•  Orientation and training of staff about emergency equipment and emergency \nprocedures \n•  Periodic emergency drills involving correctional and health care staff \n•  Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) training for health care and \ncorrectional staff \n•  Medical treatment of wards exposed to mace to include the timeframe \nappropriate for evaluation and treatment and follow up care. \n2.  CY A Headquarters should incorporate emergency management into Peer Review and \nContinuous Quality Improvement (CQI) activities system wide. \n3.  Medical units should track all mace episodes and follow up these individuals \nmedically so that  . \n1112012003  Page 64 \n\n7. Does the eYA have appropriate medical and dental quality-control procedures, and have such procedures been \nappropriately;mplemented? \n7. Does the CYA   have appropriate medical \nand dental quality-control procedures, and \nhave such procedures been appropriately \nimplemented? \nConclusion: \nCurrently, there are no meaningful quality control procedures in policy or in practice in \nthe CYA. \nFindings and Discussion: \nQuality Improvement \nCurrent CYA   policies do not address quality improvement activities. The draft \nInstitutions and Camps Manual policies (112/2003) reference a Quality Assessment and \nImprovement Committee (page 8) as a standing committee ofthe Clinical Health \nServices Staff (CHSS). \nHowever, review of the CYA Bylaws section 7.2.1.1 state that the CHSS shall have the \nfollowing standing committee.s; Executive, Credentials, Patient Care Policy, Infection \nControl, Pharmacy and Therapeutics, and Mental Health. It does not mention the Quality \nAssessment and Improvement Committee. \nInfection Control \nThere is no active infection control program statewide. Some facilities have an infection \ncontrol manual updated in 1994. We understand that a revision of the manual is \nunderway, but has not been published. There is a statewide public health nurse who \ntracks statistics and coordinates training, but we found no evidence of meaningful \nstatewide infection control activity. The Infection Control Committee, according to the \nCYA   Bylaws, directs the statewide infection control program. However, the Infection \nControl Committee does not provide any direction that is evident to individual facilities. \nDr. Briones is Chairman of the Statewide Infection Control Committee. He indicated that \nat meetings, the top issues discussed were tuberculosis, blood borne pathogens and HIV, \nbut admitted he didn't know exactly what was discussed. He knows that the CYA   doesn't \nfollow the Centers for Disease Control guidelines on tuberculosis, but he doesn't want to \nbe critical so he hasn't done anything about the CYA   guidelines. He admitted that he \ndoesn't feel he has any way to change anything, so his approach is to just listen. He did \nnot display an understanding of basic infection control principles. \n1112012003  Page 65 \n\n------------\n7. Does the eYA have appropriate medical and dental quality-control procedures, and have such procedures been \nappropriately implemented? \nInfection Control activity depends on the initiative and leadership provided at each \nindividual facility. There are, however, no regular meetings for infection control at any of \nthe facilities we visited. \nTuberculosis Statistics \nStatistics for infection control should be maintained in a manner such that the prevalence \nrate of each disease can be obtained. This requires defmitions for each statistical \ncategory. Currently, for tuberculosis, the statistic maintained is \"PPD Administered.\" \n(PPD is a tuberculosis skin test.) However, because usually more than one PPD is applied \nto each ward per year, it is difficult to obtain a prevalence rate for this condition. \nTuberculosis Form \nAll wards coming into the facility receive a tuberculosis skin test. The form to document \nthis screening activity could be modified by the following: \n•  Eliminate the word \"routine\" and substitute \"intake.\" Keep the word \"annual.\" \n•  Add a section about country of birth, specifically asking \"Were you born in the \nUS?\" This is important because, increasingly, new cases oftuberculosis are \nreported from foreign-born individuals, and it is important to track those cases \ncoming from other countries, especially Mexico. \n•  Instead of asking, \"Does ward have a history of previously positive tuberculin \nskin test?\" ask these three questions: \no  Have you ever had TB disease?\" \no  Have you ever been exposed to a person with infectious TB disease? \no  Have you ever had a history of a previously positive tuberculin skin test? \nEmployee TB Stats \nEmployee skin testing should be recorded with the following statistics. \n•  Total individuals (not tests applied) tested over a calendar year· period \n•  Number of positive skin test results (10 mm for routine and 5 mm for \nimmunocompromised) \n•  Number of individuals with a positive skin test result who were referred for \nfollow up evaluation in the community \n•  Number of positive individuals for whom active disease was ruled out. This \nshould be a requirement. \n•  Number of individuals who have had active disease diagnosed \n1112012003  Page 66 \n\n7. Does the eYA have appropriate medical and dental quality-control procedures, and have such procedures been \nappropriately implemented? \nWard TB Stats \nFor tuberculosis screening of wards, the following statistics should be maintained: \nUpon Intake: \n•  Number of wards who enter the CYA (i.e., new intakes or parole violators not \ntested in CYA within the prior year) \n•  Number of wards who enter the CYA with a previously positive skin test \n•  The number of wards who receive skin testing upon entry \n•  The number of wards tested with a positive test \n•  The total number of previous positives plus new positives divided by the number \nof intakes = % positivity \n•  Number of positives referred for preventive therapy \n•  Number of those started on preventive therapy who complete therapy \n•  Number of individuals with active disease diagnosed. \nFor Annual Testing: \n•  Total numbers of wards receiving an annual follow up tuberculosis skin test. \n•  Number of wards with a documented prior positive skin result \n•  Number of wards with a newly positive skin test result. \n•  Number of wards with a newly positive skin test divided by the number tested = \nconversion rate \n•  Number with newly positive skin test referred for preventive therapy \n•  Number referred for preventive therapies who complete therapy. \n•  Number with active disease diagnosed \nRecommendations: \n1.  Revise policies and procedures to ensure compliance with NCCHC standards \nregarding a Comprehensive Quality Improvement Programs (Standard Y -06). \nQuality Improvement should include: \n•  Infection Control \n•  Mortality Review \n•  Peer Review \n•  Drug and Formulary \n•  Compliance with policies and procedures \n2.  The HCSD should develop and implement Quality Improvement training to health \ncare staff. \n1112012003  Page 67 \n\n8. Are wards receiving medical and dental care commensurate with community \nstandards? \n8. Are wards receiving medical  dental \nan~ \ncare commensurate with community \nstandards? \nConclusions: \nDental care that is provided is commensurate with community standards with the \nexception of Chad where only emergency care is provided.  Medical care, especially care \nfor wards with chronic disease, was generally poor and was not commensurate with care \nas provided in the community.  Constitutional health care requires correctional systems to \nprovide adequate care for patients with. serious medical problems. In practice, this will \nusually involve wards with chronic illnesses or emergent conditions. The CYA   has not \ndeveloped and published acceptable guidelines for the treatment of wards with chronic \nillnesses.  Nor have they developed a system of care that appropriately treats and \nmonitors wards with serious and chronic medical conditions.  In addition, there is no \nsystem for periodic health assessments or physical examinations to screen wards for \nserious illnesses. \nFindings and Discussion: \nMost facilities have a list of persons with chronic illness, but there is no standardized \nmanner of tracking persons with chronic illness at all facilities. There should be \nstandardized protocol requiring interval visits, and interval examinations and testing. \nChronic care is poor in the CYA  .  In some cases, bad care is combined with indifference \ntoward the wards. This only compounds bad clinical care. \nAppropriate chronic illness care consists of several elements.  These include: \n•  Examinations \n•  Interval follow up \n•  Testing \n•  Provision of medication \n•  Appropriate history \n•  Modification of therapy for persons in poor control \n•  Physician knowledge base \nRecords of 29 persons with chronic illness were reviewed.  Appropriate examinations \nwere evidenced as performed in only 17% of charts.  Interval examinations for the \ndisease in question occurred in only 10% of charts I examined.  Appropriate testing \noccurred in only 14% of charts.  Medication was provided as indicated in 38% of charts. \nAn appropriate history was documented in only 14%. And there was an attempt to \nmodify therapy for poor control in 25% of records.  This reflects the absence of a chronic \nillness program. \n1112012003  Page 68 \n\n8. Are wards receiving medical and dental care commensurate with community \nstandards? \nIntake Examinations \nThe intake examination form is a check box format.  On almost all charts I reviewed all \nthe boxes were checked normal, even when wards had obvious physical problems.  This \ngives the impression that physicians do not adequately examine new wards at intake.  As \nexamples: \n•  A ward assessed as a severe asthmatic did not have a peak flow and had a normal \nexamination. \n•  A ward that was assessed with a diastolic heart murmur had the cardiac \nexamination box checked normal. \n•  A ward's intake physical examination had all boxes checked normal.  On the \nsame day a nurse took vital signs that were very abnormal.  The vital signs could \nhave resulted in an examination that would have uncovered the ward's \nhyperthyroidism, which was not picked up for several months. \n•  A ward with sickle cell disease and a history of hip surgery had all boxes checked \nnormal. \n•  A ward with chronic tympanic membrane perforations (ear) that would have been \nevident on physical examination was documented as having a normal \nexamination. \n•  A ward was incarcerated who had a recent jaw fracture and surgery.  The \nexamination boxes were all checked normal; there was no mention of the recent \njaw fracture.  At admission the dentist ordered special films of the jaw because he \nsuspected an infected fracture site.  The jaw was subsequently discovered to be \nswollen and the ward needed to be sent offsite to a specialist for surgery because \nof suspected infection. \nChronic Illness Examinations \nIn addition, for all other health care encounters in the CY A, there is a paucity of \nroutine examinations of wards even when wards obviously require such \nexaminations.  I witnessed physicians performing sick call.  At several sites. \nphysicians did not examine wards even when it was indicated to do so.  Typical \nphysician ward encounters consist of the physician asking the wards some qJlestions \nand writing a note.  Examinations that would have been appropriate for the chronic \nillness in question were not done.  Further examples of this problem were discovered \non chart reviews.  These include: \n•  A patient with new onset high blood pressure who was not examined. This \nsame ward had hypertension documented in the record for a period of 3 \nmonths.  A doctor ordered medication by phone, and did a brief examination \nabout 3 weeks later.  Otherwise, there were no physical examinations of this \nward. \n1112012003  Page 69 \n\n8. Are wards receiving medical and dental care commensurate with community \nstandards? \n•  Aside from the intake examination, a ward with asthma had only one \nphysician examination from April 2002 to April 2003. \n•  A complicated patient with a heart murmur and an abnormal \nelectrocardiogram had an inadequate physical examination at intake and was \nnot examined or followed up for over a year.  He suffered a seizure for which \nhe was hospitalized.  After hospitalization for a serious problem, there was no \nphysical examination for 2 months.  On multiple subsequent occasions, the \nward complained of symptoms that could have been referable to his heart \ncondition, but no physical examination was done.  The ward was transferred \nto the Chad facility sometime in November of 2002 and didn't have a physical \nexamination as of my visit sometime in May of 2003. \n•  Another ward with asthma had only one physical examination for a year and a \nhalf period.  During this time period, the ward suffered an acute asthma attack \nthat was managed by nurses.  He was gravely ill and was hospitalized in an \nIntensive Care Unit.  He had his only physical examination (aside from the \nintake examination) a week after he returned from the hospital. \n•  One diabetic patient with finger-stick blood sugars of 494 and 560 (these are \nextremely high and abnormal values) did not get prompt physician \nexaminations.  On multiple occasions, this ward had abnormal blood sugar \nvalues that were managed mostly by nurses. \n•  For almost a year, a ward had poorly controlled diabetes.  The physician'S \nnotes for this year period consisted of documenting \"uncontrolled diabetes \nmellitus\", without examining the ward and without changing therapy. \n•  A ward was documented as having epilepsy.  Aside from the intake \nexamination, there were no physical examinations for a year since the intake \nexamination. \n•  Another ward documented as having epilepsy and on treatment did not have a \nphysical examination for almost two years.  During that time period the ward \nhad a seizure as documented by a Medical Technician.  The ward's \nmedication had just previously been discontinued and the doctor restarted the \nmedication by phone, but there was no examination of the ward. \n•  A ward with a high pulse rate (116) that subsequently was diagnosed with \nhyperthyroidism, was evaluated by a nurse.  The nurse ascribed the increased \npulse to high blood pressure even though the ward did not have that condition. \nA physician did not examine the ward for 3 days. \n•  A ward with sickle cell disease had obvious signs and symptoms of an acute \nsickle cell crisis.  These crises are extremely painful and disabling.  The ward \nendured the crisis for about 8 days before he received a physical examination. \nThis constitutes cruelty.  During this crisis, the ward had evidence of \nsymptoms and signs sufficient that should have resulted in his transfer to a \nhospital.  After this acute event, the ward had several other complaints that \nwere evaluated without physical examinations. \n•  A ward with a history of thyroid cancer was re-incarcerated.  He did not \nreceive a physician examination for an 8-month period until he was paroled \nfrom the facility. \n1112012003  Page 70 \n\n---_ _------\n..  .. \n8. Are wards receiving medical and dental care commensurate with community \nstandards? \n•  A ward was referred to a physician by a psychiatrist for an abnormal blood \nglucose (331) that was new.  The ward had lost 20 pounds of weight.  The \ndoctor reordered the blood tests but did not examine the ward.  After a repeat \nblood test re-affirmed that the ward had diabetes, the doctor started insulin, \nbut still did not perform a physical examination of the ward.  The ward has yet \nto have a physical examination since his diagnosis. \n•  A ward with asthma that complained of trouble breathing was evaluated by a \nnurse.  Peak flow testing was abnormal.  It appears from the documentation \nthat the nurse started medication.  There was no evidence of a physician \nexamination for about a month. \nInterval Follow-up \nWards with chronic illness should be seen at regular intervals for follow up examinations, \ntesting and updates of treatment plans.  This is not done in the CYA  .  There is no system \nfor chronic disease monitoring on an interval basis.  As a result, none of the wards with \nchronic disease are seen unless they complain of a problem.  At some sites, in order to get \nmedication renewed for their chronic disease, wards must put in slips for sick call.  This \nlack of a system for chronic illness monitoring results in poor care. \nDocumentation of chronic care management and follow-up is haphazard and lacks \ndocumentation of key elements that should be followed at interval visits. Most \ncorrectional systems utilize either flow sheets or chronic disease forms to prompt \nphysicians in appropriate interval testing and examinations. These types of aides are \nparticularly useful for medical personnel who are not up-to-date on chronic disease \nmanagement. \nChronic Illness Testing \nCurrent consensus recommendations from nationally recognized professional \nassociations, recommend certain interval testing accompany the monitoring of certain \nchronic illnesses.  There is no system in place that ensures that this is done within the \nCYA  .  As examples: \n•  Virtually none of the wards with asthma have their peak flow tested on a \nroutine basis during sick call or physician encounters. \n•  With a few exceptions (Ventura), wards with diabetes mellitus do not have \nroutine testing (micro albumin, finger-stick blood glucose, fasting lipids, or \nroutine eye examinations) that is recommended for persons with their \nillness. \n•  Cholesterol screening is not routinely done when indicated.  When it is \ndone and results are abnormal there is no follow up. \nMedical History \n1112012003  Page 71 \n\n.. ---.----\n---«----~ \n8. Are wards receiving medical and dental care commensurate with community \n< \nstandards? \nPhysicians do not take an adequate history of ward's medical conditions.  The intake \nexamination fonn does not include a section for the history.  As a result, physicians at the \nintake evaluation do not take a history.  As a result, important historical infonnation \nabout a ward's medical condition is not available to medical staff.  Examples of this \ninclude the following. \n•  There were virtually no wards that had a documented history of their \nasthma taken by physicians. \n•  A ward with a diastolic heart munnur had no history taken regarding \npossible related symptoms.  After an abnonnal electrocardiogram is also \nobtained, there was no history to try to identify possible problems.  During \nhis subsequent CYA   incarceration, this ward had symptoms possibly \nreferable to his heart (chest pain and dizziness) on 4 separate occasions, \nbut did not have a history taken by a physician. \n•  No ward with diabetes had a documented adequate history of their \ndiabetes care in the medical record. \n•  None of the wards from charts I reviewed with epilepsy had an adequate \nhistory of their epilepsy taken. \n•  Wards with significant illness (cancer, sickle cell disease, severe asthma, \ndiabetes, etc.) coming into the CYA at intake facilities do not have \ndocumented histories that clarify the nature oftheir illnesses. \nTherapy of Persons with Chronic Illness \nIn addition to these components of a chronic illness program, care of persons with \nchronic illness should be guided by appropriate standards of care.  Based on chart \nreviews, most wards in the CY A did not have their chronic illness treated in a manner \nconsistent with national consensus guidelines.  Asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, sickle disease \nand hypertension were not managed appropriately. Problems in this area include: \n•  All 3 long-tenn patients with diabetes, whose charts I evaluated, had deterioration \nof their diabetes while housed in the CY A.  Two of three wards deteriorated \nsignificantly.  Physicians did not seem to have knowledge of how to provide basic \ndiabetes care.  One of the patients, based on my interview with him, seemed to \nhave better basic knowledge of diabetes than the physician treating him.  There \nwas no documented evidence that physician histories or examinations were in \nkeeping with recommendations from national consensus standards of care. \n•  One ward with hyperthyroidism was mismanaged.  Physicians managing this \npatient continued anti-thyroid medication when it was dangerous to do so. \n•  A ward with sickle disease was incompetently managed. \n•  Physicians did not refer wards requiring specialized care to consultants.  This \nincludes patients with thyroid cancer, Grave's disease (hyperthyroidism), and a \nward with a cardiac condition. \n•  Wards with high cholesterol were not evaluated or treated even when it was \nindicated. \n1112012003  Page 72 \n\n------\n-~---~--\n8. Are wards receiving medical and dental care commensurate with community \nstandards? \nPhysician Knowledge Base \nTreatment of persons with chronic illness requires a level of fundamental knowledge on \nthe part of the physicians. Based on chart reviews, several physicians in the system do not \nappropriately treat chronic illnesses. Review of the credentials verifies that their training \nis insufficient. While they could augment their skills or have mentoring from better \nphysicians in the system, this is not occurring. The current expectation is that every \nphysician independently understands how to treat all of the conditions of the wards. This \nis not practical or reasonable given the group of practitioners in the CYA  . There are \nseveral options in addressing this problem: \n•  Hire only practitioners who are board certified in a primary care field (Pediatrics, \nInternal Medicine or Family Practice). This may be impractical. \n•  House all wards with chronic medical conditions (by classification) into fewer (3) \nfacilities so as to concentrate them in facilities with better-trained physicians. This \nis a preferable option since it requires no change in the configuration of staff and \nhas no coSt. There are classification issues. \n•  Institute stafftraining to provide a fundamental understanding of basic chronic \ncare treatment. \n•  Develop simplified understandable chronic disease protocols or use existing \nappropriate protocols. \n•  Develop a system of ensuring that these protocols are followed by using fonns \nand/or flow sheets. We strongly suggest that the NCCHC chronic disease \nprotocols be used or modified for use in the CYA  . Additional protocols would be \nnecessary. Someone knowledgeable and trained should develop these in the area \nof concern. There is staff within the CYA   system that could contribute to this \neffort. The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has useful chronic \ndisease forms and protocols. \n•  Establish a system of peer review and physician evaluation to promote better care. \nPrevention Services \nFour ofthe top six causes of death for adolescents involve behavioral patterns rather than \nmedical conditions.  Data from the Centers for Disease Control from 1996 demonstrates \nthat death from accidents, homicides, suicides, and HIV account for 77% of all deaths in \nthe 15-24 year old age group in the United States.  As well, much of the physical harm, \npoor social outcomes, increased mortality, and behavioral problems that affect adults are \nthe result of behaviors developed in adolescents.  Long standing violent behavior, obesity \nand physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, unwanted pregnancy, unsafe sexual practices, \n1112012003  Page 73 \n\n8. Are wards receiving medical and dental care commensurate with community \nstandards? \nand illicit substance abuse (including alcohol use) all result in increased adult morbidity \nand mortality.  The behaviors initiated during adolescence become the causes of health or \ndisease as adults.  For these reasons, any program of adolescent health care must include \na program of prevention and incorporate development of healthy behaviors. \nThe United States Health and Human Services (in the Guide to Clinical Preventive \nServices) and the American Medical Association (in its Guidelines for Adolescent \nPreventive Services) strongly support preventive services for adolescents.  The emphasis \noftheir prevention programs lies in screening interventions and behavior change. \nBehavior change is a recent but important element of preventive services.  To quote the \nU.S. Preventive Health Services Task Force, \nAlthough immunizations and screening tests remain important preventive \nservices, the most promising role for prevention in current medical practice may \nlie in changing the personal health behaviors ofp atients long before clinical \ndisease develops. \nHistorically, in traditional medical programs, preventive services have not been stressed. \nThe necessity of intervening with behavioral change models in otherwise \"healthy\" \nindividuals was questioned.  However, evidence now exists that prevention interventions \nreduce death and morbidity or are highly likely to be effective in reducing the harmful \ncondition or behavior. Work by the U.S. Preventive Health Services Task Force and the \nAmerican Medical Association resulted in identification ofthose preventive measure \nlikely to reduce age related causes of morbidity and mortality.  For adolescents, a \nprogram of prevention should include the following elements: \n1.  Measurement of height \n2.  Annual measurement of weight (BMI) and blood pressure \n3.  Updates for vaccinations (Td, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis A, MMR, Varicella, \nRubella) \n4.  Papanicolaou tests for females \n5.  Chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV and syphilis screening as indicated by risk \ngroup \n6.  Intake and then annual Mantoux skin test for tuberculosis \n7.  Screening cholesterol test as indicated by the National Cholesterol \nEducation Project \n8.  Screening for alcohol and other drug use and counseling on high risk \nbehavior as indicated \n9.  Screening for depression and risk for suicide and treatment if indicated \n10. Screening for tobacco use and counseling on smoking cessation \n11. Sexual behavior screening and counseling for STD prevention \n12. Injury and violence prevention counseling \n1112012003  Page 74 \n\n8. Are wards receiving medical and dental care commensurate with community \nstandards? \n13. Opportunity for obtaining an appropriate diet and regular physical activity \nand counseling on the importance of appropriate diet and exercise \n14. Annual dental visits with prophylaxis \n15. Opportunity to floss teeth and fluoride toothpaste \nThe current health care program in the CYA   is seriously deficient in the area of \npreventive services.  As detailed elsewhere, the CYA   does perform preventive screening \nat intake.  With some minor modifications (detailed in the intake screening section of this \nreport), the CYA   program could be consistent with national standards.  However, there is \na virtual absence of a program of screening for behavioral medical health problems and \ncounseling to change those behaviors. There is no attempt to change harmful adolescent \nbehaviors or to promote health promoting behaviors. We did not identify any evidence of \na program of meaningful counseling or prevention at any of the facilities.  Physical \nactivity is not specifically promoted for all wards, and collaboration with medical \npersonnel to ensure healthy diet practices is non-existent.  While individual practitioners \nmay be providing information to wards on a case by case basis, counseling activity is not \npromoted or given any support or substance.  Given the age of the wards and the potential \nfor future benefits of such a program, this deficiency is a major lost public health \nopportunity. \nRecommendations: \n1.  Develop a chronic illness program in the CYA  . \n2.  The chronic illness program should include clinical guidelines that are \nbenchmarked against national consensus standards.  We recommend utilizing the \nchronic care guidelines as provided by the National Commission on Correctional \nHealth Care and other national guidelines already cited. \n3.  Institute training of physicians in chronic illness management.  Utilize flow sheets \nand other devices that prompt physicians to monitor interval testing and \nexaminations in a specified manner. \n4.  Establish peer review and other auditing processes that regularly examine the \neffectiveness of chronic illness care. \n5.  Increase the numbers of physicians with training in the management of chronic \nillnesses ofthis popUlation (Internal Medicine, Family Practice, and Pediatrics or \nAdolescent Medicine).  In lieu of this, re-classify wards who have chronic \nmedical conditions to facilities where this expertise exists. \n1112012003  Page 75 \n\n-----\n-----------\n8. Are wards receiving medical and dental care commensurate with community \nstandards? \n6.

First, relevant written materials (e.g., CYA annual reports, school \nimprovement plans, school site plans, course standards, master schedules, course guides, \nIndividualized Education Plan reviews, and other supporting documents) were reviewed. \nSecond, individual interviews were conducted with administrators, teachers and other \nsupport staff at all sites visited.  Third, site generated data, including special education \nrecords, individual ward IEP's, attend(U1ce data, school closing data, special management \nunit documents, class rolls, school schedules, high school graduation plans, psychological \nevaluations and educational reports were reviewed at each facility.  Fourth, team \nobservations of classroom activities, ward movement, and special management programs, \nincluding mental health and other restricted programs, were conducted. \nThe written materials provided both past and current data.  Interviews with educational \npersonnel revealed staff perceptions of the strengths and needs of the education program. \nDirect observations conducted by the team resulted in a series of findings and \nrecommendations regarding the general and special education programs. \nProcedures \nAn assessment team composed of two members with expertise in educating incarcerated \nwards conducted the review.  Dr. Thomas O'Rourke, Associate Superintendent for \nEducation, Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, and Dr. Robert Gordon, Technical \n\n----.------\n2 \nAssistance Consultant, Special Education/IDEA Compliance, Georgia Department of \nJuvenile Justice, served as team members.  This team represented over seventy years of \ngeneral and special education experience. \nThis report is based on interpretation of information derived from visits to the following \nCYA   operated schools: Johanna Boss High School, N.A ChadeIjian High School, Fred C. \nNelles High School, Lyle Egan High School, Mary B. Perry High School (female unit \nonly), Jack B. Clarke High School and the Southern Youth Correctional Reception Center \nand Clinic. These reviews included randomly selected ward files, general and special \neducation documents, information provided by the California Youth Authority and the \nCalifornia Attorney General's Office and plaintiff supplied documents. In addition, direct \nobservations and interviews were conducted with wards and staff to provide other sources \nof information as deemed appropriate. Because of the relatively brief time involved in the \nactual site reviews, this report is limited in its ability to provide ongoing descriptions and \nshould be utilized only as one source of information for making broad and global \ndecisions. \nMore than one hundred individuals were interviewed during the course of the review. All \ninterviewees were assured that their comments were confidential and that they would not \nbe individually identified. Notes were not shared with any CYA   or Attorney General \nCounsel staff. \nFindings and Program Recommendations \nThe following findings and recommendations are provided as a means to focus on the \ngeneral and special education program functions that are consistent with the CYA   written \nphilosophy and mission statement.  Specific general and special education findings are \nprovided in all thirteen areas of review along with program recommendations. \nA special thanks to the Deputy Director of the CYA Education Branch and his \nadministrative staff for their support in providing all of the reports and data requested. \nAll site-based and central office staffwere candid and cooperative in responding to \ninquiries and providing information necessary to complete this report. \n\n----------------\n3 \nArea of Inquiry # 1 \nDoes the CYA provide adequate educational opportunities to the wards? \nGeneral Education and Special Education Findings: \nThe overall quality of the high school programming offered to general and special \neducation wards by the CYA   is considered to be adequate. In some cases the programs \nbeing provided are exemplary. \nThe California Youth Authority is commended for its efforts to provide quality \neducational programming for the wards committed to its care. Educational and \ninstructional programs have been developed to provide meaningful learning experiences \nwith a common core of knowledge and skills to prepare them for transition back into \nsociety as contributing citizens. Of particular note in these efforts are the curriculum \nguides, the comprehensive vocational programs, program policies and procedures, case \nconferences and High School Graduation plans, post secondary opportunities, and the \ndedication of the central office and site based educational staff. \nThe CYA   is commended for having produced Curriculum Guides in the areas of \nmathematics, language arts and social studies.  The guides provide content standards and \na process for instruction and assessment designed to improve academic achievement for \nthe wards committed to the CYA  . The guides serve as the foundation for the educational \nprQgram through which learning can take place in the correctional setting. The courses of \nstudy meet requirements for high school graduation or its equivalent.  There is \ndocumented emphasis on compliance with local, state, and national standards. \nThe Vocational offerings at the facilities reviewed are exemplary.  Wards in these \nclasses were actively engaged in the programming and taking advantage of the training \nopportunities provided to them. These programs provide opportunities for the \ndevelopment of real world work skills through on-site learning and work experiences. \nThe Education Services Branch Manual including the Special Education Policies and \nProcedures Manual were found to be comprehensive and well written. \nThe concept ofthe High School Graduation Plan and the use of Case Conferences \ninvolving multi-disciplinary representation demonstrate the CYA's commitment to the \nprovision of quality educational and counseling opportunities for each individual ward. \nThe format for the development of the IEP's for wards exceeds California Department of \nEducation and IDEA Standards. The monitoring efforts of the central office special \neducation coordinators are commendable. \nThe CYA   is commended for providing opportunities for post-secondary course work \nthrough community college partnerships. \n\n4 \nThe reviewers were impressed with the dedication and commitment of the central office \nstaff, teachers and site based administrators to meeting the needs of the ward population. \nThe educational staffwas determined to provide the wards with meaningful skills and \nknowledge necessary to successfully transition back into society. \nSpecific areas of concern and related findings regarding the CYA   educational program \nare outlined in detail under the remaining 12 Areas of Inquiry in subsequent sections of \nthe report. The critical areas that need to be addressed are adequate funding for academic \nand special education staff, ward attendance, special education record keeping and the \nneed for increased institutional support for the educational program. Once these areas are \naddressed, the California Youth Authority will be better able to provide quality \neducational opportunities for its ward population. \n\n5 \nArea of Inquiry # 2 \nOn a system-wide level, does the eYA have a sufficient number of general \neducation teachers, special education teachers and educational psychologists? \nGeneral Education and Special Education Findings: \nAt the facilities visited (ChadeIjian, Lyle Egan, Nelles, Johanna Boss, Mary B. Perry and \nJack Clarke) there are an inadequate number of credentialed teachers to provide a \ncomprehensive academic program to all wards. The CYA   does not employ an adequate \nnumber of credentialed teachers in general education to provide course offerings in all the \nrequired academic areas. \nThe staffing ratio does not account for the different types of high school programs \n(regular and restricted) offered at each site.  There is a need for differentiated staffing due \nto the numerous specialty units and restricted settings, such as cages, which require a \nhigher staffing ratio. The staffing formula uses a baseline developed many years ago (see \nAttachment A). The formula must be updated to meet the unique needs of the ward \npopUlation.  The number of regular and special education teachers allocated is not \nadequate to meet the 15: 1 and 12: 1 staffing ratios required by California Youth Authority \npolicy. \nThe sites reviewed reported special education teacher and/or psychologist vacancies. \nSchool administrators at each site (Boss, ChadeIjian, Egan, Nelles, Perry and Clark~) \nreported teacher vacancies for extended periods of time due to their inability to recr:uit \ncredentialed individuals. They have resorted to hiring part-time educational and school \npsychologists, due to their inability to provide competitive salaries and the changing \navailability of funding. The Inspector General's report of June 2002 confirms that \ncomparable public school district pay scales average 4 - 10 % higher than the CYA  . \nInadequate compensation makes it difficult to both recruit and retain teachers and \npsychologists.  Unlike public schools, the CYA   facilities are not allowed to employ \nteachers with emergency credentials.  This practice limits individual site flexibility in \nstaffing. \nDue to the budgetary constraints, teacher positions are eliminated immediately if the \nward popUlation at that site drops by 15 wards. The areas of English, special education \nand mathematics are impacted disproportionately.  For example, Lyle Egan High School \nhas a surplus of vocational teachers and a need for credentialed special education, \nmathematics and science teachers. \nSite Specific Findings: \nJohanna Boss \nThe program reports two full time general education teacher vacancies and an \ninability to recruit substitute teachers.  This ongoing problem impacts adequate \nservice delivery, causes class closures and has a negative effect on teacher morale. \n\n6 \nN.A. Chaderjian \nThe ChadeIjian facility has a shortage of general education teachers in the main \nschool program. They did not have a credentialed language arts teacher.  The \nschool principal reports that the facility is virtually unable to identify and employ \na pool of qualified substitute teachers. \nThe current educational service delivery model involves providing general and \nspecial education services to wards placed in numerous sites throughout the \nfacility.  The CYA   funding formula does not provide an adequate number of \nspecial education teachers. The program will never be able to earn a sufficient \nnumber of special education teaching staff until a funding exception is developed. \nA differentiated staff allocation appears to be the only practical solution to the \nproblem at this site. \nLyle Egan \nThe Principal is working outside of his credentialed area.  His current vocational \ncertification is not sufficient for his level of administrative responsibility. \nOn the day of the review, the program had six special education teacher \nvacancies.  The school principal stated that he was unable to attract qualified \nindividuals due to significant salary differences between CY A and local school \nsystems. \nSix general education faculty members were identified who were assigned \nteaching responsibilities outside of their credentialed areas.  The facility employs \na ful~y credentialed mathematics teacher; however, this individual is not assigned \nteaching duties.  They offer only two sections of science; this limited schedule \ncannot meet the high school graduation plans developed for the wards housed at \nthe facility. The program fails to offer physical education because they do not \nhave a credentialed teacher in this area. \nThe site was overstaffed in vocational teachers according to the number of \nvocational class offerings. \nThe school is also in need of a fully qualified librarian, which they have been \nunable to recruit for a number of years. \nFred C. Nelles \nOn the day of the review the school administration reported five resource special \neducation vacancies and one schooV educational psychologist vacancy. \nThe facility fails to employ a GED teacher and has an unfilled position for an \nadministrative supervisor of academic instruction. An additional teaching \nassistant vacancy was noted. \nThe program has not employed a full-time speech and language pathologist since \nSeptember 2002.  They currently utilize the services of a part-time employee who \nworks primarily at night and on the weekends.  The program is unable to meet the \nidentified service requirements in the IEP's of26 speech therapy eligible wards. \n\n7 \nSpecial education resource personnel who provide services to multiple sites (some \nin excess often minutes walking time from the main school program) cannot \nphysically provide the instructional contact hours specified in the individual \nIEP's. \nThe school administration indicated that the significant salary differences between \ntheir facility and the local school districts hamper employment efforts. \nMary B. Perry \nGeneral education teaching shortages in the areas of mathematics and science \nwere reported; currently the program employs only one teacher in each of these \ncritical fields. \nThe program currently employs one full time school psychologist.  A second \nfunded position has not been filled. As a result ofthe psychologist vacancy, the \nStudent Consultation Team has a backlog of wards to be evaluated. \nJack B. Clarke/Southern Clinic \nThe program's principal reported vacancies for 2 multiple subjects teachers, 1 \nhigh school teacher, I emotionally learning handicapped teacher, I physical \neducation teacher, and I school psychologist. \nThere were no credentialed mathematics and science teachers. Individuals \nteaching in these slots were teaching outside of their credentialed areas. \nThe physical education teacher was not certified. \nThe principal stated that the staffing ratio atthis site is not consistent with CYA   \npolicy. She further stated, \"Clinics are different and need special staffing \nconsiderations.\" \nRecommendations: \n1.  Organize efforts to recruit and employ more teachers in the core academic \nareas, especially dually credentialed teachers, capable of instructing both \nregular and special education wards. \n2.  Take the necessary steps to fill teaching vacancies with credentialed teachers. \nConsider employment of teachers with emergency credentials. Work to \nprovide a competitive salary scale, comparable to the local school districts, in \norder to recruit and retain teachers and administrators. \n3.  Address the issue of credentialed teachers leaving the CYA   due to \noverwhelming paperwork by reviewing the data collection system to eliminate \nredundancy. \n4.  Provide a pool of qualified substitute teachers at each site to help offset \ncurrent teacher shortages.  Individual sites located on the same campus \nshould be encouraged to jointly develop a shared pool of substitute teachers. \n\n8 \nArea of Inquiry #3 \nIs the attendance rate in the CYA educational classes appropriate? \nGeneral Education and Special Education Findings: \nA six month review of the Monthly ADA reports indicated that an average of20-30% of \nthe wards were absent from school each day. Attendance re~ords provided by the CYA   \ncentral office after completion of the site reviews showed improvement in attendance for \nsome facilities. Even though there is improvement, this is an area of concern. \nDue to inaccuracies identified on attendance reports at Chaderjian and Nelles, it is \ndifficult to determine the number of wards actually in classrooms. On the day of the \nreview, actual class counts at Chaderjian, Nelles, and Egan had inaccurate entries. For \nexample, at Lyle Egan on the WINN 96 report, one class count was reported as having \nminus three (-3) wards scheduled for the class; a second auto painting class reported a \nnegative one (-1) enrollment. \nWards in all main high schools were observed being pulled from general and special \neducation classes to attend other programs, including Board mandated activities, without \nregard to their educational needs.  It is evident that education is not the primary focus \nduring the school day. \nIn order to increase school attendance and move toward making education a central focus \nofthe school day, the center director at Nelles established a collaborative team building \neffort. Comparable efforts were noted at Perry and Johanna Boss. Similar efforts, \nhowever, were not evident at Chaderjian and Lyle Egan. These two facilities fail to \nadequately address absences and school closures as they relate to attendance rates. \nBecause of frequent lockdowns at Chaderjian and Egan, general education and special \neducation wards are routinely prevented from attending the main high school programs. \nSite Specific Findings: \nJohanna Boss \nWhen the number of wards attending each class exceeds 18, the excess wards are \nroutinely returned to their living units and deprived of an opportunity to receive \n240 minutes of teacher directed instruction. On the day ofthe review, two groups \nof approximately eight wards were observed being returned to the living quarters \nbecause of overcrowded conditions. This practice contributes to lower attendance \nrates . \n. N.A. Chaderjian \nInterviews with 5 general and special education teaching staff as well as \nindividual interviews with 11 wards indicate the perception that school attendance \n\n9 \nis optional. Attendance records reviews (N=22) and unit staff interviews indicate \nthat wards are allowed by unit personnel to elect to attend school or not. \nA review of disciplinary report infonnation on four wards indicated that dorm \npersonnel did not write up reports within the required 24-hour period for wards \nrefusing to go to school.  This practice would appear to encourage ward absences. \nGeneral and special education wards are routinely pulled from school or simply \nheld back from school when counseling or other living area activities are \nscheduled. Compensatory services for classes and instruction missed are not \nprovided. \nFred Nelles \nA six-month review of the Monthly ADA report (7/02 - 1103) indicates that on \naverage 27 % of the wards are absent from school each day. \nWards are prevented from attending school for reasons not related to their \nbehavior in the classroom (green light status, gang affiliation, mental health pull \nouts).  Individual classroom attendance data documents that entire groups of \ngeneral and special education wards are held back from school for Board \nmandated classes. \nSecurity procedures require that wards are not allowed to leave their donns to \nattend school during the morning if their first period teacher is absent.  These \ngeneral education and special education wards are also held in their living units \nduring second period, even when the second period teacher is present and ready to \nteach. As a result, wards are required to miss multiple hours of school. \nWard attendance at the main school program is at times considered \"optional\". \nTeachers and administrators at this site report living unit staff offers wards the \nopportunity to \"elect\" to attend school or to stay on their living unit. \nLyle Egan \nOn a routine basis, wards are held back from school for counseling by mental \nhealth or dorm staff and/or for Board mandated classes.  The program does not \nprovide compensatory services to special education wards for the IEP services \nmissed during these routine absences. \nBoth general and special education wards scheduled to appear in court or \nadministrative hearings are held in their dornls for the entire school day. Many of \nthese hearings occur in the afternoon. \nTwo wards were reported refusing to get out of bed in the morning and being \nallowed by donn staff to \"sleep in\".  Program policies and procedures require that \n\n10 \nin such instances a disciplinary report be completed within 24 hours.  After \nwaiting the required 24 hours, a second check was made.  Disciplinary reports had \nnot been written for the wards' refusal to go to school.  Interviews with the school \nprincipal and five individual wards indicate that this is a common and accepted \npractice at this facility. \nIn one instance, a ward was observed being removed from his classroom by \nsecurity and taken to get a haircut.  The ward was not reported as absent from \nclass despite the fact that he was gone for the entire period of instruction. \nMary B. Perry \nA seven month review ofthe ADA report (10102- 4/03) revealed that an average \nof 12% of the general education and 26% ofthe special education wards were \nabsent from school each day. \nGeneral education and special education wards are routinely pulled from school \nfor Board mandated classes, mental health counseling and other non-school \nrelated activities. \nRecommendations: \n1.  There is an need to develop an agency wide committee made up of \ninstitutional administration, security, living unit staff, and educational staff \nto develop a workable plan to eliminate the competing interests that \ninfringe on the instructional day resulting in increased ward absences. This \ncommittee should exchange ideas and focus on a clear understanding of \nthe roles of each area and the teamwork needed to provide a quality \nprogram to meet the needs of the wards. CYA leadership must establish \npriorities to ensure that wards attend all assigned classes each day. \n2.  School attendance should not be considered an option. Enforce existing \npolicies on school attendance and ensure that disciplinary reports are \ncompleted on wards refusing to attend school. Provide appropriate \nconsequences for wards refusal to attend school. \n\n11 \nArea of Inquiry # 4 \nDoes the CYA have a sufficient number of general and special education \nclasses? \nGeneral and Special Education Findings: \nIf all wards assigned to the six sites reviewed were to attend classes at the main high \nschool programs simultaneously, some wards would have to be sent back to their rooms \nbecause of class n~bers far exceeding current allowable limits. (See Attachment B). \nThere are an insufficient number of credentialed teachers allocated to each site to meet \nthe general education staffing ratio of 15:1 or the special education ratio of 12:1.  The \nformula uses a baseline developed many years ago that must be updated to meet the \nchanging ward popUlation. The funding formula is not designed to provide enough \nteachers and classes to serve all of the school eligible wards at one time. \nAll sites report an inability to employ and maintain the number of credentialed teachers \nneeded to provide a sufficient number of general and special education classes. Teacher \npositions are vacant for extended periods of time due to staffing cutbacks and the  . \ninability of administrators to recruit credentialed individuals. All sites reported difficulty \nrecruiting and retaining teachers due to salary inequities. \nSite Specific Findings: \nN.A. Chaderjian \nAccording to the schedule provided by site staff, the main high school meets the \nminimum standard of at least 240 minutes of instructional time.  The schedule \nindicates that the 5th period class will be held on the living units, but this is not \noccurring.  Interviews with 5 teachers indicate that only one went to the living \nunit on a consistent basis. \nThe fact that multiple school programs are housed in separate sites within the \nfacility prevents the school from providing sufficient general and special \neducation classes to meet the wards' needs.  Since general and special education \nwards are spread throughout the main high school program and mUltiple secure \nunits, the teachers' abilities to provide services are limited.  The CYA   funding \nformula reduces teacher positions when the facility fails to maintain the required \nminimum number of wards in classes.  This funding formula does not provide for \ndifferential staffing patterns and is viewed as a contributor to the program's \ninability to provide a sufficient number of classes. \nFred C. Nelles \nThe principal reports that when the number of wards attending school exceeds the \nallowable class limits, the excess wards are sent to the library for \"educational \n\n12 \nactivities\".  If any of the excess wards are special education eligible and being \nmainstream ed, they are assigned back to their special education teacher for that \nclass period. \nSpecial education resource teachers serving as primary service providers have to \ntraverse significant distances (10 minutes plus walking time) to serve small \nnumbers of wards.  It is unlikely that the teachers are able to consistently provide \nthe required service hours indicated in the ward IEP's and teacher monthly service \nreports.  Class numbers reported by the facility appear to meet CYA   funding \nrequirements. \nLyle Egan \nGeneral education teaching vacancies referenced in Inquiry # 2 reduce the \nfacility's ability to provide a sufficient number of needed classes in the core \nsubject areas.  There were surplus vocational teachers, while vacancies in \nmathematics, science and special education remain unfilled. \nThe excessive number of special education teacher vacancies (6) has resulted in \nthe reduction of teacher contact hours for both general and special education \nwards. The program has resorted to reducing the number of classes for regular \neducation wards in an effort to provide the minimum special education contact \nhours. The practice of reducing required special education hours was noted in \neleven special education records reviewed on site. \nMary B. Perry \nThe program's failure to employ a needed mathematics teacher prevents them \nfrom offering a sufficient number of mathematics classes for general and \nmainstreamed special education wards. \nJack B. Clarke/Southern Clinic \nSeveral staff vacancies (as stated in Inquiry#2) prevent them from offering a \nsufficient number of general and special education classes to permit the wards to \nadvance in their HSGP's. \n\n13 \nArea of Inquiry # 5 \nAre classes cancelled too often? \nGeneral and Special Education Findings \nFrequent class cancellations contribute to the fact that all facilities fall short of the \ntargeted 90% attendance rate set by the CYA   Education Services branch. This was \nevident from the review of a sample of the 200212003 monthly ADA reports for all sites. \nClass cancellations also contribute to the failure of all six CYA   sites reviewed to provide \nspecial education wards with access to a fu11240-minute instructional day. \nTeacher absences, maintenance issues and security concerns significantly impact class \ncancellations at all facilities.  The lack of substitute teachers (discussed in Inquiry #2) is \nalso frequently a cause of cancelled classes. Classes are cancelled due to counseling \nsessions scheduled during the school day.  No evidence was produced at any of the \nfacilities to indicate that wards are required or allowed to make up lost instructional time \ncaused by these routine pUllouts.  None of the facilities reviewed provided special \neducation wards with compensatory services for the classes missed. \nWhen classes exceed their allowable numbers, the excess wards are sent back to their \nliving units on a rotating basis. This practice, which is followed at all the facilities, is an \neffort to prevent class closures due to overcrowding. \nSite Specific Findings: \nJohanna Boss \nClasses are routinely canceled when teaching staff are sick or on vacation. \nA review of the class closures for the facility indicates that during December \n2002, 48% of all classes were canceled due to a broken alarm system. \nOn the date of the review, the school principal reported that all classes were on \n\"over flow status\".  Wards were rotating back to their dorms to prevent class \nclosures. \nN.A. Chaderjian \nA six-month review of the monthly ADA report (7/02- 1/03) indicates that an \naverage of27% of the classes were closed each day for a variety of reasons. \nSchool closings were routine and often not school-related.  Class cancellations \ndue to security issues, teacher absences and lack of available substitute teachers \nconstitute a significant problem. As verified by teacher interviews and records \nreview (N=22), classes are closed for extended periods oftime when teachers are \n\n14 \nabsent or take annual leave.  A review of one special education teacher's \nattendance file revealed that a classroom had been closed for almost one month \nwhile the teacher was on vacation.  No compensatory efforts were noted. \nFred C. Nelles \nA six-month review of the monthly ADA report (7/02- 1103) indicates that an \naverage of 28% of the classes were closed each day for a variety of reasons. \nAdministrators confirm that living unit staff routinely pull wards out of school for \nnon-school related reasons.  Groups of general and special education eligible \nwards are not allowed to attend school for some or all of the day when counseling \nsessions by mental health staff and Board mandated classes are scheduled during \nthe school day. This results in class cancellations. No evidence was produced to \nindicate that wards are afforded the opportunity to make up missed work or \nprovided compensatory services when they have missed extended periods of \ninstruction. \nClasses are cancelled when an entire unit is placed on lockdown status and wards \n(general and special education) are not permitted outside their rooms for \neducational screenings, instruction or other related educational activities. \nWhen the teacher(s) assigned to the first period are absent, groups of wards are \nheld back in their dorms for both the first and second periods, even though the \nsecond period teacher is present and ready to teach. This results in unnecessary \nclass cancellations. \nLyle Egan \nSchool administrators and teachers acknowledged that class closure rates exceed \ncurrent CYA   expectations . \n. Classes are frequently cancelled because of teacher vacancies, absences and the \ninability to employ substitute teachers. \nMary B. Perry \nA seven-month review of the monthly ADA report (10/02- 4(03) indicates that \nmore than 25% of the classes were closed each day for a variety of reasons. \nThere is an excellent system to minimize class closures due to case conferences. \nThe school is closed on a monthly basis so that teachers can attend case \nconferences. The system, however, is not fully operational. Institutional staff \ncancel case conferences with little or no advance warning. The lack of \ncommunication results in unnecessary class cancellations. \n\n15 \nRecommendations: \n1.  There is an immediate need to develop an agency wide committee made up of \ninstitutional administration, security, living unit staff, and educational staff to \ndevelop a workable plan to eliminate the competing interests that infringe on \nthe instructional day resulting in class closures and increased ward absences. \nThis committee should exchange ideas and focus on a clear understanding of \nthe roles of each area and the teamwork needed to provide a quality program \nto meet the needs of the wards. CYA leadership must establish priorities to \nensure that wards receive 240 minutes of uninterrupted educational \nprogramming each day. \n2.  Establish a uniform school calendar to be followed by all CYA   school \nprograms.  Define the school year with specific dates when the semesters \nbegin and end.  A 220-day school year is recommended, with two 90-day \nsemesters and a 40-day summer session.  The schedule would also indicate \nstate and national holidays, ward and teacher breaks, and planning and \ntraining days.  The calendar should be correlated with school calendars of the \nstate of California and local school systems. The scheduling of breaks (winter, \nspring and summer) would allow teachers to plan vacations and reduce the \nteachers' absences and class closures during scheduled school sessions.  A \nstandard school calendar would facilitate the planning of agency wide in \nservice training for teachers.  It would also allow the CYA   to schedule Board \nmandated courses and other activities for the wards at times that do not \nconflict with the school schedule. \n\n16 \nArea of Inquiry #6 \nOn a system wide level, do an appropriate number of wards receive high \nschool diplomas or general education degrees while in the CYA? \nGeneral and Special Education Findings: \nThis is a very difficult question to answer. Each of the CYA sites report varying numbers \nof wards receiving high school diplomas and general education degrees. These figures \nalone do not provide a means to detennine whether the numbers are appropriate.  The \nconcept of the High School Graduation Plan and the use of Case Conferences \ninvolving multi-:disciplinary representation demonstrate the CYA's commitment to \nproviding quality educational opportunities for each individual ward. Consistent \nimplementation of these policy directives, however, is essential in order to enable wards \nto make educational progress. \nOne way to address the issue of whether an appropriate number of wards receive high \nschool diplomas or general education degrees is to monitor the wards' progress on \nindividual High School Graduation'Plans. A review of 20 High School Graduation Plans \nat each of the six sites visited indicate that 25 % of the plans were not being implemented \nas written. This is a result of many factors, including scheduling problems, class size \nlimitations, lack of available credentialed teachers in the required course areas, security \nand safety issues. \nThe most systemic factor continues to be the CYA's failure to consistently provide all \nwards access to a full 240-minute instructional day. Wards at Chad and Egan were \nreceiving less than 240 minutes of instruction each day due to gang affiliations, security \nconcerns, mandated treatment, housing assignments or other factors. Wards at \nChaderjian, Egan and Perry scheduled for a 240-minute day receive less instruction due \nto delays caused by ward movement. As a result, wards in these facilities are not \nattending school for a full day and are earning high school credits at a reduced rate. \nIt was sometimes difficult to detennine whether wards were making appropriate progress \ntowards receiving high school diplomas or GED's due to problems in record keeping. \nFor example, 25% ofthe ward schedules reviewed at Fred Nelles (5 out of20 randomly \nselected schedules) did not reflect actual class enrollment, making it difficult to draw \nconclusions on individual ward progress towards high school graduation requirements. \n(This included schedules for 4 general education wards and IEP implementation for 1 \nspecial education ward). \nThe issue of wards with disabilities graduating with regular high school diplomas is not \ncurrently addressed in IDEA regulations. The 1997 revision of IDEA, however, places \nsignificant emphasis on the involvement of disabled wards in the general curriculum and \nin state assessment programs. Special education wards have been limited in their ability \nto make progress towards graduation due to the denial of access to general education \nclasses (Jack B. Clarke) and reductions in service hours (Chaderjian and Egan) caused by \nextended disciplinary isolation. \n\n17 \nThe review also identified wards with disabilities that were failing to meet minimal \nprogress expectations.  IEP information reviewed at Boss indicated that one special \neducation ward had earned 5 credits in a 7-month period.  A second 18-year-old special \neducation ward at Nelles had been in the CYA system for over three years.  He had \nearned a total of 72.5 credits towards high school graduation and was currently only \nenrolled in two classes.  Similar instances were documented at Chaderjian and Egan. \nThe IEP is the primary tool for ensuring the special education ward's involvement and \nprogress in the general curriculum, according to IDEA 97. There is little evidence to \nindicate that full access to the general curriculum is being provided. Only 26 of the 55 \nidentified special education wards enrolled in the girls' program at Perry attend the full \nfour period school day. \nRecommendations: \n1.  In order to increase the number of wards receiving high diplomas and GED' s, the \nschool administration must take steps to reduce class cancellations, resolve \nscheduling problems, and increase the number of available credentialed teachers \nin the required course areas. \n2.  Wards in restricted programs for extended periods oftime must have full access \nto core curriculum materials and receive 240 minutes of daily instruction in order \nto make satisfactory progress in their High School Graduation Plans. \n\n18 \nArea of Inquiry # 7 \nOn a system wide level, is the quality of education offered in the eYA \nadequate? \nGeneral Education aud Special Education Findings: \nGeneral comments on the quality ofthe CYA   educational program are found in the \nresponse to Inquiry # 1.  This response addresses specific areas 0 f the educational \nprogramming noted by the reviewers. \nThere are CYA   curriculum guides for the areas of mathematics, language arts, and social \nstudies. There is a need to complete the guides in the area of science. The CYA   \ncurriculum standards from each course need to be aligned with the Expected Schoolwide \nLearning Results at each site and the California Department of Education academic \ncontent and performance standards. The CYA has begun to make efforts to align IEP \ngoals and objectives with the CYA   core curricular requirements. \nPolicy 4130: Instructional Practices calls for unit instructional plans to include the \nfollowing: course syllabi, units ofiIistruction and lesson plans. Many (55%) of the \nteachers visited were not using lesson plans. These teachers did not have standards posted \nand/or a course syllabus available for review. \nPolicy 4100: Guidelines for Curriculum Development calls for curriculum subject area \ndepartments to oversee the development and implementation of program standards and \nward achievement.  ChadeIjian, Lyle Egan, and Clarke did not document existence of \nsuch committees. \nPolicy 3300: School Daily Schedule calls for wards to be enrolled for at least an average \nof 240 minutes of instructional time each day.  The site reviews found that this is not \nbeing provided at all facilities, particularly in the restricted programs. \nThe vocational programs observed at ChadeIjian, Egan, Nelles and Perry met the needs \nofthe ward population.  Wards enrolled in vocational classes were actively engaged in \nprogramming provided by vocational teachers. \nServices for special education wards are often not provided in the least restrictive \nenvironment.  Special education and related services are often limited by staffing \nrestrictions, security concerns and inadequate funding formulas. Special education and \nrelated services are not provided in the amount and type indicated in the individual \nwards' IEP's. Educational materials provided to wards at ChadeIjian and Egan are \nprimarily related to general instruction, as opposed to specific areas of deficit as indicated \nin the ward's IEP.  At all sites, general education staff do not consistently provide \naccommodations for the special education wards' instructional needs in mainstream \nclassrooms. \n\n19 \nSite Specific Findings: \nJohanna Boss \nThe school has a very clear mission and vision based on their beliefs as well as \nward needs.  General and special education classroom instruction in the main high \nschool program is very good.  Wards were observed to be focused and on task. \nThe administration has organized the school program into four departments \nresponsible for six subject areas.  Teachers at this facility are assigned four classes \ndaily. The principal made every effort to limit subject area preparation for \nteachers to two subject areas, which supported quality instruction and lesson \nplanning. Teachers at the facility are required to develop and follow formal \nwritten lesson plans.  An observation of 6 classes indicated that all of the teachers \nhad appropriate lesson plans. \nThe educational staff employs test data to make informed decisions involving \nward placement. The staff has developed comprehensive High School Graduation \nPlans for the wards.  Wards are routinely assigned academic advisors who assist \nthem with their academic programs. The case conferences were well organized \nand involved all staff that worked with the ward popUlation. There is strong \nevidence of collaborative efforts between the teachers, medical staff, housing staff \nand others in order to better meet the wards' educational needs. At the 3 case \nconferences observed, teachers were well versed in the needs and progress of eac;h \nward represented. \nA review of academic assignments given to the wards returned to their dorms \nwhen their total class enrollment exceeded 18 indicates that the assignments were \nnot directly related to the classes missed and were generic in nature.  The quantity \nof the materials failed to meet the CYA   requirements of three hours of \nindependent study materials. \nThe school provides a wide array of multicultural activities designed to enhance \nthe learning process. \nLibrary media services were evident to support the instructional program through \nthe use of print and non-print materials.  Wards were encouraged to use the \nlibrary. \nTechnology has been introduced and is in use in nearly all of the classes observed. \nWards are provided the opportunity to engage in keyboarding skills. \nVocational education has been downsized and replaced, in part, with programs \nemphasizing academic and character education. There is a need to provide \nvocational programming for the wards to enable them to have the work skills \nnecessary to become employed once they leave the CYA  . \n\n20 \nFred C. N eUes \nThe school has a clear mission and vision that provides direction for the \neducational program.  The school is using\" expected schoolwide learning results\" \nas the learning outcomes predictor for the wards.  This information provides the \nfoundation for the school's WASC self-study and school improvement plan. \nA review and observation of 8 teachers revealed that they were striving to meet \nthe unique needs of the wards by using a variety of instructional strategies to \naddress the different learning styles.  Teachers posted ward work samples in the \nclassrooms and encouraged the wards to actively participate in classroom \nactivities. \nThe orderly movementofwards during class changes allows classes to begin on \ntime and wards to receive allotted instructional time. \nAn adequate number of courses is provided for the general ward popUlation; \nhowever, circumstances such as gang affiliation, safety and security concerns, the \ngreen light phenomenon and other sub-cultural factors prevent many wards from \nenrolling in appropriate classes as designated in their High School Graduation \nPlans. \nLibrary media services were evident to support the instructional program through \nthe use of print and non-print materials. Wards were encouraged to use the \nlibrary. \nThe administration and staff is complimented for the implementation of the \nmandated homework/stUdy hour five days a week in each cottage. \nA records review indicated that wards were enrolled in college level classes \noffered through Rio Hondo College, once they graduate or complete GED \nrequirements. \nThe Student Council and the Cadet Program were evidence of ward involvement. \nThey provide opportunities for leadership and self-discipline and offer personal, \nsocial, and academic experiences not found in the regular classroom. \nThe Foster Grandparent program provides support to the teachers for the \ninstructional program. \nN.A. Chaderjian \nThe CYA   policy on daily school schedule calls for wards to be enrolled for at \nleast an average of 240 minutes of instructional time each day. The site review \nfound that this is not the case.  Many wards were receiving only 120 minutes of \ninstruction each day.  Wards scheduled for the fu11240-minute day, in reality, . \n\n21 \nonly receive 210 minutes, due to extended movement activities. Valuable teacher \ntime that should be devoted to instructional activities is spent participating in \nward movement.  Teachers at the facility spend up to 90 minutes per day standing \nat their classroom doors observing wards as they transition across campus. \nThe facility has a fragmented school program.  The facility operates five separate \nhigh school programs due to the segregated ward popUlation: the regular high \nschool, SMP school, treatment, protective custody, and temporary/long tenn \ndetention. These schools were inadequately staffed and offered limited \ninstructional programming. \nTo ensure educational opportunities for the wards, the 5th period has been \ndesignated as the time to conduct case conferences, IEP meetings, SCT, HSGP \nand educational advisements. The review indicated that teachers, for the most \npart, were not involved in these activities. A records review indicates that no SCT \nmeetings occurred from November 2002 through January 2003.  The SCT at this \nfacility is essentially non-functioning. \nThe vocational offerings at this facility were meeting the needs of the ward \npopulation.  Wards in these classes were actively engaged in the programming \nand taking advantage of the training opportunities provided to them. \nLyle Egan \nWards were found to be receiving 120 minutes or less of instruction each day, due \nto staffing shortages, gang affiliations, treatment concerns, housing issues, and \nother factors. \nSpecial education and general education wards are served on \"abbreviated\" school \nschedules at the main high school program.  During the three-day review, \nobservations of morning movement revealed that the school day begins 10-15 \nminutes later than the posted schedule indicates.  A second IS-minute delay was \nobserved during mid-day movement.  School administrators report that these \ndelays are typical and expected.  The ward movement related delays shorten the \nnumber of minutes of instruction by 30 minutes each school day. \nCompeting facility programs reduce ward school attendance. Wards' progress \ntowards meeting their HSGP's is inhibited by mandates of their incarceration \n(e. g., victim, gang, or anger management groups) that are scheduled during the \nschool day. \nA review of the 2002 SMP Ward Credit Report indicates wards seldom received \nacademic credit while on SMP. \nObservation of all of the vocational programs indicated that the teachers were \nproviding quality instruction that was meeting the needs of the ward popUlation. \n\n22 \nWards in these classes were actively engaged in the programming and taking \nadvantage of the training opportunities provided to them. \nMary B. Perry \nTeachers and administrators at the facility were found to be both dedicated and \ncapable.  The program has a history of staff stability.  Lesson plans, as well as a \ncourse syllabus for all subject areas, were evident.  Standards were posted as \nrequired.  The school staffwas found to be very knowledgeable of the ward \npopUlation and the instructional program. \nShrinking resources limit the number of classes the facility is able to offer.  Often \nwards are forced to wait extended periods of time before being allowed to emoll \nin courses required in their HSGP. The site employs only one mathematics and \none science teacher, which limits the ability to provide adequate academic courses \nfor the ward popUlation. \nMovement of the wards to and from school is extremely slow.  School opening is \nroutinely delayed due to this ongoing problem.  Morning and mid-day ward \nmovement delays shorten the actual school day by approximately one hour each \nday for all wards attending the main high school program. \nThe vocational program was outstanding.  Broad program offerings were found to \nmeet the needs ofthe wards.  Programs include computer skills, culinary arts, and, \nanimal grooming skills. Although considered a coeducational facility, males and \nfemales are separated for all daily activities. Males were not provided access to \nany vocational classes. \nThe wards had access to Ventura Community College, which provided an \noutstanding transition program for the older wards. \nThe Citizens Advisory Committee provided support through tutorial services to \nthe wards. \nJack B. Clarke/Southern Clinic \nWards were required to attend physical education classes but they were not issued \ncredit for this academic period. As a result, wards were not provided 240 minutes \nof instruction each day in prescribed academic courses. \nThere is only one vocational offering (site maintenance), for a small number of \nwards. \nRecommendations: \n\n23 \n1.  All curricula and IEP goals/objectives should be aligned with the CYA core \ncurriculum objectives in order t6 maximize the impact of instruction on the \nwards' academic achievement. \n2.  When all curriculum guides have been completed, a system of electronic \naccess should be developed to ensure that all staff have immediate access to \nthe guides and related instructional information. This system would also allow \nstaff statewide access to any revisions of curriculum materials. \n3.  A careful review should be conducted to insure that CYA wards are not being \nheld to higher grading and course standards than public school students. The \nmathematics requirements for graduation from the CYA   should be examined. \nWards are being required to pass Geometry to get a high school diploma; this \nexceeds the requirements for public school students. \n4.  A greater emphasis should be placed on the GED and vocational \nprogramming for the older wards. This emphasis would reduce the need for \nteachers with credentials in the areas of mathematics and science, since \ngeneral credentialed teachers can be used to teach the GED. \n5.  All sites should be held accountable for a yearly inventory oftextbooks and \neducationally related non-consumable supplies and equipment. There is a need \nfor library books and textbooks in the living units at all sites. Efforts should be \nmade to provide an adequate number of books for wards to do homework. \n6.  Technology hardware and software should be added at all sites to address the \nwide range oflearning modalities. Technology can be used to enhance the \ncurriculum and to provide more varied learning experiences for the ward \npopUlation. \n7.  Trade Advisory Committees, as outlined in the Education Branch Manual, \nshould be implemented at each site. It is important to involve the trade \ncommunity in the operation of the CYA   vocational programming in order to \ninsure the real world relevance of the instructional program. \n8.  The CYA should conduct a vocational program and employability study to \ndetermine the effectiveness of each of its vocational programs. It is important \nto determine how well wards aretransitioning back to the community with the \nskills provided in the CYA  . The study needs to address whether wards are \ngaining successful employment as a result of the training programs. \n9.  All educational leaders must possess appropriate credentials and skills. The \nhigh turnover rate of building level administrators necessitates ongoing \ntraining. The knowledge, skills and actions ofthe CYA   site principals and \nassistants need to be refined to improve the quality of instruction to wards. \nSpecific training should be provided in these areas: vision/mission/goals and \n\n24 \nobjectives, leadership responsibilities, balance of instruction as viable part of \nthe general and special education process, utilization of personnel with \nmultiple responsibilities, communication, and special education instructional \nrequirements for both regular and special education teachers. \n10.  Consideration should be given to developing an Educational Leadership \nAcademy to internally train potential educational leaders for the CYA  . This \nacademy would be used to provide potential leaders with the skills necessary \nto administer the educational program. \n\n25 \nArea of Inquiry #8 \nDoes the CYA have appropriate testing for learning and other cognitive \ndisabilities? \nGeneral and Special Education Findings: \nThe CYA   facilities conduct testing utilizing a three-tier system that includes: 1) \nevaluation and formal records review during intake; 2) administration of achievement \ntests; and 3) observational data collection after the ward is placed in class. In Chapter 5 of \nthe California Education Authority Special Education Policy and Procedures Manual, \nthere is a comprehensive outline of both general policy and assessment procedures. \nVery clear policy expectations on assessment team responsibilities and extensive \ninformation on assessment report content are provided. \nTeachers and administrators at Boss, Chad, Egan, Nelles and Perry, report that it I \ncommon for a ward to be transferred from the diagnostic facility with partially complete \nassessment data. When this occurs, the resource specialist, and when appropriate the \nschool psychologist, at the receiving facility must complete the educational assessment. \nIncomplete evaluations result in increased workloads and additional assessment \nresponsibilities for receiving site personnel. On the day ofthe review the school \nadministration at Johanna Boss reported that forty-six files were missing Home Language \nSurveys, typically part of the assessment battery provided by the CYA   Diagnostic Center. \nEvaluations must be up-to date, thorough and adequate before appropriate IEP's can be \ndeveloped. Educational assessments (N=10) developed at the Southern Clinic were \nsometimes lacking information necessary to make informed educational decisions. In one \ninstance, the only instrument used to re-evaluate a ward identified as learning disabled \nwas the Matrix Analogies Test (MAT).  It should be noted that significant progress is \nbeing made in this problem area at the Southern Clinic, beginning with the January 2003 \nreports written by education diagnostic staff.  Interviews with staff and the CYA   Special \nEducation Program Specialist assigned to the center confirm that extensive staff \ndeVelopment activities had been provided at the facility during this same time period.  It \nis felt that this effort significantly improved the quality of diagnostic center produced \neducational evaluations. \nThe SP-MIS Placement data for RSP, SCIINT and SDC (7/26/02) reports 796 of a \ntotal special education popUlation of 1254 served in CYA facilities as Specific Learning \nDisabled. As indicated by a sampling of ward information obtained from files at five \nCYA sites visited prior to the Clarke review (SLD = 32 files), the CYA   diagnostic \ncenters identified nine of the wards in the sample (21 %) with reading problems, classified \nthem as learning disabled, and placed them in special education based on limited \nassessment. Diagnostic evaluations provided by the regional diagnostic clinics rely \nheavily on base measurements.  Many of the curriculum-based assessments utilized \nreading and writing samples that the CYA   staff did not consider age appropriate for the \npopUlation. Consideration should be given to reviewing the evaluation materials currently \n\n26 \nbeing used for learning disability assessments and expanding the available evaluation \ninstruments to include more accurate and age appropriate materials. \nSite reviews of CYA   clinic assessments for wards identified as intellectually impaired \n(N=4) were found to contain all necessary components, including the use of mUltiple \nassessment information as well as adaptive behavior scales.  Psychological information \nprovided in assessments for wards identified as emotionally or behaviorally disordered \n(N= 11) for the most part was viewed as well written and comprehensive. Two of the 11 \nreports failed to address family history and contained marginal background information. \nEducational evaluations conducted by the CYA   place much emphasis on determining \neligibility for special education services through formal and lengthy assessments.  There \nare prescribed lists of assessment instruments provided by the CYA   to be used by the \nevaluators at the diagnostic clinics.  Site reviews revealed that mandated assessment \ninstruments were missing parts, or in one case, could not be located.  Interviews with \nassessment staff at the Southern Clinic revealed that two ofthe individuals responsible \nfor evaluating wards had never seen the CYA   required assessment list. \nThe concept of assessment is emphasized in IDEA 97 by references to identification, \ndiagnosis, review, observation and testing.  IDEA requires documentation of efforts to \nassess and to use the results of the assessments to ensure the effectiveness of efforts to \neducate wards with disabilities. The testing and assessments provided to wards is of \nquestionable value due to the inadequate consideration given to improve educational \nperformance based on assessment information. Compliance with IDEA requires \ndocumented efforts to attempt to improve wards' performance in addition to attention to \nrights and protections. \nRecommendations: \n1.  It is recommended that a review of the available assessment instruments used by \nclinic educational diagnostic staffbe conducted to insure that the methods and \ninstruments are appropriate for the age, language, and cultural background of the \nwards being assessed.  Emphasis should be placed on identifying and utilizing \nassessment tools that provide age appropriate writing and reading components. \n2.  All clinic educational diagnostic assessment materials should be examined.  Any \ncomponents missing from the assessment kits should be replaced. \n3.  The regional special education specialist should provide in-service training on \nassessing wards using the CYA   adopted instruments.  Additional staff \ndevelopment in the area of assessment report content is also recommended. \n4.  It is recommended that the diagnostic clinic staffbe required to maintain \ndocumentation regarding all partially completed assessments forwarded to the \nCYA facilities.  This documentation should include: date of ward enrollment, \ndate(s) of clinic assessment(s), and explanation ofreason(s) for the incomplete \n\n---_ \n•.. _---.. \n27 \nassessment.  This infonnation should be reviewed by the Clarke principal and by \nthe regional special education specialist on a monthly basis. \n5.  Training should be provided in the use of standardized testing to identify wards' \nacademic weaknesses .and the appropriate strategies to meet the identified \ninstructional needs. \n\n28 \nArea of Inquiry # 9 \nAre the Individualized Education Plans (IEP's) appropriate for the individual \nwards? \nSpecial Education Findings: \nThe CY A makes clear its intent to maintain federal and state compliance and to provide \nmandated services.  During the 6 site reviews a total of 145 IEP's were examined, which \nrepresents a sample of slightly more than 10% of the total special education population. \nThe special education population on June 30,2002 was reported to be 1,255, which was \n21.4% of the total ward population. Site special education teachers, special education \nadministrators and clerical personnel provided additional specific information from 101 \nspecial education files.  The development and implementation of over 1200 IEP \ndocuments on an annual basis can be an overwhelming task. Although they have \ndemonstrated the ability to comply with special education regulations, the CYA   has not \nbeen able to ensure full compliance at each site on an ongoing basis. \nIEP's are required to include educational goals and objectives. All educational staff \nactively involved in the ward's education must implement the goals, objectives and \nbenchmarks. A total of 103 IEP's did not contain documentation of benchmark review. \nThe failure to keep the IEP's current infers that the CYA programs do not consistently \nmonitor individual educational benefits or measure instructional gains. \nCourts and federal agencies are clear that IEP's and other relevant paperwork should \ndocument options considered on the continuum of alternative placements and why less \nrestrictive options were rejected.  The rationale must be clearly and appropriately stated. \nThirty-four IEP's of wards placed in restrictive placement in excess of thirty days at \nChadeljian, Nelles and Egan were found to lack clarity on this issue.  The documents \nreviewed at Chadeljian, Egan, Nelles, Perry and Clarke (N=28) indicated that when \nreviewing wards on administrative lockdown status, the school teams consistently started \nwith consideration of placement in the most restrictive environments and then moved \nbackwards along the continuum. In some instances, it appeared that the CYA   IEP team \ninferred that the ward needed to be maintained in a segregated environment because it \nwould be \"best\" for the ward.  One IEP document at Egan stated that full educational \nservices specified in the IEP should be immediately re-implemented upon the ward's \nrelease from the extended restricted placement. The IEP, however, failed to address how \nthese \"needed services\" would be provided during the restricted placement. \nThe special education regulations require that transition services be defined in several \nareas of the IEP by the time a ward turns 16.  By age 14, the IEP team must define needs \nfor transition services that will actually be provided when the ward reaches age 16.  If \nproviding transition services is not appropriate, the IEP team must state that they are not \nand give the basis on which the determination is made. A number of the IEP's (N=29) \nfailed to provide complete information.  The transition plans reviewed were so similar \nthat individualization based on the ward's needs seemed questionable. \n\n29 \nThe CY A does not currently have the ability to adequately monitor compliance at each \nsite and take corrective measures when a site fails to meet departmental expectations. \nThe CY A central office employs two individuals to monitor and maintain special \neducation compliance.  One serves the northern California area, while the second works \nwith programs in the southern portion of the state.  These individuals should be \ncommended for their efforts; however, geographic distances and the large number of \nspecial education wards limit their ability to monitor each program and to correct the \ndeficiencies noted in these findings. \nSite Specific Findings: \nJohanna Boss \nA review of25 active IEP's, information supplied by program staff and staff \nverification of information contained in 15 additional ward IEP files indicates that \n20 of the documents contained IEP benchmarks that had not been reviewed or \nhonored.  The program failed to document monitoring of progress on the IEP. \nThree IEP' s were identified that were out of date. Additionally two triennial \nevaluations were identified as over due. \nThe goals and objectives written for one ward identified as legally blind state that \n\"The student will attend school full-time and earn credits for graduation; pass \nCASAS writing test.\" The benchmark states, \"Pass all classes with a c or better\". \nThe remaining secondlEP goal is written to address his ability to manage feeling \nin an appropriate manner.  The single academic goal for this ward would certainly \nbe simple to monitor, but it is viewed as inadequate to address the ward's \neducational needs. \nA comment written in the IEP for one ward stated that the required counseling \nwould not be provided due to \"staff cut backs\". \nSpecific areas of concern identified in the individuallEP reviews include the \nfollowing: \nFailure to adhere to the requited 50-day timelines as identified in CYA   \npolicy. (1) \nFailure to document review of IEP benchmarks (20) \nFailure to indicate date of intended IEP benchmark review (2) \nFailure to address IEP transition areas involving interagency \nresponsibilities and/or linkages for wards aged 17 and over (4) \nIEP completed without general education teacher present (1) \n\n30 \nA total of 3 IEP's contained documentation of periodic progress reviews. \nNone ofthe IEP's contained documentation of general education \nnotification or receipt of needed accommodations \nN.A. Chaderjian \nDuring the ChadeIjian visit a total of 35 ward IEP files were fonnally inspected. \nVerification by facility staff of infonnation in 15 additional files provided the \nbasis for the following findings: \nProgress reports indicating implementation and review of IEP goals and \nobjectives are not being completed on a regular basis.  The California Youth \nAuthority Operations Manual, Section 7240, provides that a principal/coordinator \nshall carry out procedures to schedule, on an annual basis, reviews of all \nindividual education plans (IEP's).  The special education file review indicates \nthat one teacher was serving six special education wards with expired IEP's.  The \nIEP annual reviews for all six files had not been held.  Only one file could be \nconsidered a relatively new admission; the remaining five wards had been \nresidents at the facility for varying extended periods of time.  Records indicate \nthat three additional triennial reviews were overdue. \nSpecial education and related services outlined in the IEP's of wards assigned to \nrestricted placements are routinely reduced (16 files/verifications) \nClassroom assignments do not align themselves with specific IEP goals (21 \nfiles/verifications).  Observations in two Special Day Classes indicate \ninconsistencies in the alignment of classroom assignments with IEP goals and \nobjectives. \nSpecific areas of concern identified in individual IEP reviews include the \nfollowing issues: \nFailure to document review ofIEP benchmarks (25) \nFailure to indicate date of intended IEP benchmark review (4) \nFailure to address IEP transition areas involving interagency \nresponsibilities and/or linkages or failure to complete or respond to all \nareas of transition for wards aged 17 and over (9). \nIEP contains IEP goals and objectives that are not considered measurable \nor are not in the stated area(s) of need  (4) \nIEP completed without general education teacher present. (2) \n\n31 \nNone of the documents reviewed contained documentation of periodic \nprogress reviews. \nNone ofthe documents reviewed contained documentation of general \neducation notification or receipt of identified accommodations. \nSchool administrators were unable to provide documentation that general \neducation teachers are aware of required classroom modifications and \naccommodations.  Interviews with three general education and two special \neducation teachers provided verbal information indicating that general education \nteachers do not consistently make accommodations and/or regularly implement \nIEP goals and objectives.  All general education teachers interviewed (6) indicate \nthat after an IEP is written for a ward, they are provided copies of the document \nfrom the special education teacher assigned to the ward. All teachers stated that \nwhen the ward transfers from their class, the IEP information might not be \ntransferred to the next teacher serving the ward. Information obtained from three \ngeneral education teachers at the facility indicates that they do not accommodate \nfor individual needs as indicated in the ward IEP's. \nFred C. Nelles \nDuring the site review a total of20 IEP's were examined.  Sampling information \nwas provided by the special education staff from an additional 10  ward special \neducation files and records. \nObservation and participation in an annual review conference for a ward \nconducted by education staff provided the following information: The ward was \nover 18 years of age.  The IEP committee failed to provide him with information \nand/or copies of his procedural rights during or after the meeting.  He was, \nhowever, required to sign the informed consent section of the IEP documenting \nthat this had occurred.  Team members had checked the section acknowledging \nreceipt in advance.  The ward was not informed of his rights, and he was not \nprovided with the information necessary to make informed consent decisions. \nIn a second instance, an original IEP was compared with copies of the document \nreportedly made after the IEP meeting had occurred.  The copies of the document \nwere to be distributed to team members and participants, including the ward. \nExamination of the copies revealed that they were lacking goals and objectives for \ntwo areas identified as significant needs. The missing information on the original \ndocument appears to have been written by someone other than the author ofthe \noriginal goals section.  The copies suggest that the goals and objectives were \ncompleted after the IEP meeting had been held.  This means that the ward was not \nafforded his guaranteed right to participate.  The addition to or alteration of the \noriginal IEP documents outside of the formal IEP team meeting is prohibited. \nReview of five IEP's written after wards had been placed on lockdown status for \nmore than ten days revealed that the program incorrectly reported the revisions as \n\n32 \nannual reviews.  The express purpose ofthese meetings was to review ward \nbehavior management plans.  This is not an annual review. Essentially, the \nprogram is \"resetting\" the IEP clock each time they conduct these meetings.  For \nexample, a ward whose annual review was conducted six months ago participates \nin the behavior management plan meeting and staff reports this as a new annual \nreview.  They then change the review date for the ward's next \"required\" annual \nreview from the original date to one that is one year (12 calendar months) from \nthe date of the behavior management meeting.  This has extended the IEP from its \noriginal 12 months to 18 months. \nIEP Benchmarks are not being reviewed when due (11 files). There is no \nsystematic process for monitoring goals/objectives per the IEP.  The program fails \nto provide documentation of periodic progress reports. \nA review ofIEP's revealed two instances ofIEP meetings being conducted \nwithout a required member present (regular education teacher). \nClassroom assignments do not align themselves with specific IEP goals (9 \nfiles/verifications).  Observations in three general education classrooms providing \nservices to special education eligible wards also revealed inconsistencies in the \nalignment of classroom assignments with IEP goals and objectives. \nOne ward file contained two statements of need in two specific areas but did not \nlist have any goals or objectives addressing these identified needs. \nSeveral of the randomly reviewed IEP's contained minor errors that confuse \nintent or compliance.  For example, one IEP failed to address the impact ofthe \ndisability in the Present Level of Performance section.  The benchmarks had not \nbeen reviewed on this IEP.  A second IEP failed to report the number of regular \neducation hours the ward was to receive on the first page ofthe document and \nalso did not indicate the benchmarks had been reviewed. A third IEP lists the \nward as receiving 2 hours of resource services and 1 hour DIS counseling weekly; \nthis IEP then indicates that the ward will not be in regular education 10% of the \ntime.  A fourth IEP indicates that a ward will receive 5 hours of resource services \nper week plus one hour of DIS counseling and will receive zero (blank) % regular \neducation services. \nIt was difficult to document implementation of IEP provisions and classroom \nmodifications for wards placed in general education classes. A system has not \nbeen developed for documenting that general education teachers are provided \nwith information on classroom modifications and accommodations indicated in \nthe IEP.  General education teachers do acknowledge that they are provided with \ncopies of wards' IEP's. Evidence was lacking that general education teachers \nhonor individual provisions, modifications and/or accommodations.  When \nquestioned, one general education teacher at Nelles remarked that she \"treats all \nof her wards the same way, and that they had to do the same work in order to \n\n33 \npass\".  A second Nelles general education teacher remarked that he expects his \nentire classroom, both regular and special education wards, to be able to \"do the \nsame work or they will fail\".  Both teachers, however, acknowledged that they \nhad been provided with copies of the wards' IEP goals and objectives. \nLyle Egan \nA total of25 active special education files were formally reviewed.  Program staff \nprovided information from 13 additional special education files and documents. \nThe Monthly Special Education Report submitted on 04/2/03 reports a backlog of \n52 IEP's on the date of the review (28 Annuals, 1 Initial, 15 Triennials and 12 \nspecial reviews). Five reviews were considered to be on time line while 6 were \nreported as off timeline. \nInterviews with school administrative staff indicate that wards placed on O&R \nand SMP routinely have service hours reduced based on the availability of special \neducation staff and not on identified needs indicated in the individual IEP's. \nServices to wards placed in lockdown units are limited and sometimes sporadic. \nSpecial education, and when required, related services are not provided in the \namount specified in the individual ward's IEP. \nSpecific areas of concern identified in individual IEP reviews include the \nfollowing issues: \nIEP goals, objectives, and benchmarks are not reviewed within specified \ntime limits. (17files/verifications) \nFailure to document review ofIEP benchmarks (17) \nFailure to indicate date of intended IEP benchmark review (2) \nSeveral of the randomly reviewed IEP's contained minor errors that \n.c onfuse intent or compliance.  The IEP for one ward was written on \n11119/02 and was scheduled to expire on 11119/03.  The special education \nand related services listed on the same page of the document are scheduled \nto run from 11119/03 to 11/19/04.  The goals and objectives on the IEP \nhave not been reviewed since 11119/02.  A second IEP written for a ward \nwho had been in restrictive placement for more than one calendar month \nfor behavior did not contain any behavioral goals or Individualized \nBehavioral Plan.  A third IEP calls for the goals to be reviewed one time \n(the same date as the next annual review).  One file contained an IBP \nwritten by the program's school psychologist with the ward present, but \nthe ward did not sign it. \nObservations in three general education classrooms providing services to special \neducation wards revealed inconsistencies in the alignment of classroom \nassignments with IEP goals and objectives.  Interviews with four general \n\n34 \neducation teachers confinned that they do not implement the required \naccommodations identified in the individual ward IEP's.  All four teachers \ninterviewed acknowledged previous receipt of individual ward IEP's when they \nwere \"mainstreamed\" into general education classrooms. \nMary Perry \nDuring the site review a total of20 IEP's were examined.  Sampling infonnation \nwas provided by the special education staff from an additional 18 ward special \neducation files and records. \nData reviewed for a total of 91 male and female wards indicated that 24 had \nexpired IEP's (1 initial, 15 annual reviews, 6 triennial reviews, and 2 special \nprogram reviews). \nThe program fails to maintain records of individual progress reviews of IEP goals, \nobj ectives and benchmarks.  The CYA   Special Education Director indicates that \nshe has provided all programs with approved fonns; however, they are not being \nused at this facility. \nObservations in two general education classrooms providing services to special \neducation wards revealed inconsistencies in the alignment of classroom \nassignments with IEP goals and objectives. Observations and interviews with two \nadditional teachers indicated that they were provided the identified classroom \nmodifications, including extended time to complete work and shortened \nassignments.  .  . \nJack B. Clarke/Southern Clinic \nDuring the site review a total of20 IEP's were examined.  Sampling infonnation \nwas provided by the special education staff from an additional 10  ward special \neducation files and records. \nIt was evident that two IEP's had been developed outside of the actual meeting. \nThe completed IEP's were signed by education staff and predated prior to the \nactual meeting date. \nProgress reports indicating implementation and review ofIEP goals and \nobjectives are not being completed. \nThree instances were found of wards newly admitted to the facility not being \nplaced in classes or provided educational assessments within the 5 calendar days \nspecified in CYA   policy. A review of ward files indicates that the program has \nfailed to implement wards' IEP's within 5 calendar days. Interim IEP's are not \nbeing developed within the required 30 calendar days. (N=2) \nWards classified and served as diagnostic placements are placed in self-contained \nclassrooms and are not afforded access to regular education.  This method of \n\n----\n---------------\n35 \nprogramming violates wards' rights of access to a free and appropriate education \nwith regular education peers.  This practice also fails to take into account the \neducational placements outlined and required in the individual ward's IEP. \nThe program fails to follow prescribed procedures for decertifying or exiting \nwards from special education services. In two files, IEP goals and objectives were \nfound that had been erroneously developed for wards that were no longer eligible \nfor special education.  One file failed to document graduation and/or completion \nof IEP goals as required. \nRecommendations: \n1.  All sites should be required to review current IEP's developed for wards \nassigned to restricted placements for more than 10 days. This review should \nbe made to ensure that they contain the necessary documentation to support \nthe changes in placement. Behavioral intervention plans developed for these \nwards must be revised to provide interventions addressing specific behavioral \nissues and justify any changes in service hours. \n2.  Special education personnel at each site should receive training emphasizing \ndocumentation of benchmark review, including periodic progress reporting. \n3.  The CYA   should clarify the roles and responsibilities of both general and \nspecial education administrators and teachers to ensure compliance with \nIDEA regulations. Staff development should be provided to all teachers on the \nimportance of alignment of instructional programs and curriculum with the \ndevelopment of the IEP's. \n4.  The CYA   must expand its internal monitoring efforts to include more \nevaluation of IEP development and implementation. This internal system \nshould include a minimum of quarterly compliance reviews at all sites.  The \nreviews should address IDEA regulations, including IEP implementation, \nCYA   policies and procedures, and other relevant special education standards. \n5.  It is recommended that the CYA   take immediate steps to identifY additional \nstaff or experienced educational consultants to review compliance and provide \ntechnical assistance and training.  . \n\n36 \nArea of Inquiry #10 \nIs the eYA providing adequate education to wards in restricted programs? \nGeneral Education and Special Education: \nThe most systemic factor impacting wards placed in restricted programs is CYA  's failure \nto consistently provide all ofthese wards access to a full 240-minute instructional day. \nEducational services to wards on the restricted programs were limited. Instances of \ngeneral education wards placed in the unit at Egan who were receiving 1 hour of \neducation per week were noted; special education wards in the same unit were provided \nwith one hour of academic instruction per day.  Staff at Chaderjian and Egan were unable \nto document that wards were receiving full academic credit for work completed during \nextended stays in the restricted units.  Wards were identified who had been required to \nenroll in elective courses not related to their HSGP (N=11). The amount of instructional \nhours provided for both general or special education wards (an average of 120 minutes \ndaily) fell below the CY A policy requirement of 240 instructional minutes at all facilities. \nWards assigned to lockdown units do not attend classes on a regularly scheduled basis. \nCY A policies require that in situations such as extended lockdowns, wards are to be \nprovided one hour of formal academic instruction and three hours of \"independent study\" \nmaterials.  Documentation of adherence to these policies was not available at Chaderjian, \nEgan and Perry.  Since general education and special education wards in lockdown at \nthese facilities have limited access to books and writing instruments, they consistently \nfail to meet this standard.  Boss, Chaderjian, Egan, Nelles and Perry provide only limited \ncourse offerings on their lockdown units.  They have failed to develop and expand the use \nof core curriculum instruction on these units, despite written assurances made in their Site \nPlans. \nRestricted programs at all facilities visited reduce ward instructional hours and class \nofferings without adequately addressing educational need in the IEP. Under IDEA, the \nCYA   is not required to provide educational services during the first ten days in a school \nyear that wards are removed from school for disciplinary reasons.  During any subsequent \nremovals for ten days or less, the facility must provide services to the extent necessary to \nenable the ward to progress in the general curriculum and advance toward achieving IEP \ngoals. This has not been done.  Special education wards placed on restrictedllockdown \nstatus for extended periods oftime routinely have required service hours reduced and are \nnot afforded compensatory services.  The academic instruction offered to wards in \nrestricted placements for more than 10 days (N=19) failed to relate to the individual \nward's IEP goals and objectives and did not appear to be directly related to course \ncontent and curriculum objectives. \n\n37 \nThe reviewers had concerns over the length of time wards spend in the restricted \nprograms and the impact on their educational opportunities.  School administrators at \nChadeIjian, Egan and Nelles report that the restrictive programs in their facilities lack \nclear-cut exit criteria.  It was the general consensus at all sites that exit from the \nrestricted programs is a security decision and input involving manifestation or \neducational need was not solicited. Behavior Management Plans (N=9) in IEP's \ndeveloped at ChadeIjian and Egan, for wards who were placed in restricted placements in \nexcess of 10 days, either were not implemented, or when successfully implemented, had \nno impact on the length of placement. \nSite Specific Findings: \nJohanna Boss \nWard interviews and file reviews for five wards (general and special education) \nassigned to the restricted units for more than 10 days indicate that wards are \nroutinely denied access to the full 240-minute school day based on security \nconcerns.  It is noted that often rule violations occurring outside of the school \nprogram result in these restricted placements.  There was a lack of adequate \nreview of potential manifestation issues by the IEP teams in all files reviewed. \nSamples of academic work provided to wards failed to comply with CYA   \nrecommendations that they be provided with 1 hour of academic instruction and \nthree hours of independent study materials.  The quantity of materials provided to \nthe five wards reviewed was inadequate for this purpose. Interviews with unit \nstaff, the attending psychologist and teacher indicate that ward requests for \n\"extra\" schoolwork were routinely denied. \nMathematics materials provided to one ward in the restricted unit consisted of \nalgebraic equations; the mathematics work sheet was titled Algebra.  The ward \nindicated that he had completed algebra and was enrolled in geometry. He also \nstated that he had completed the same work sheet on two previous occasions. A \nreview of the ward's transcript confirmed that he had completed algebra and was \nenrolled in geometry. \nFor special education wards, it is common practice to reduce the number of \nservice hours provided when they transfer from the regular school campus to a \nsecure unit. This reduction in service hours was not found to be based on the \nneeds of the individual ward as indicated in the IEP .  Wards assigned to \nlockdown units were not provided adequate educational opportunities, including \naccess to needed academic courses.  Materials provided to these wards were \nlimited and unrelated to the class or course content. \nOn the day of the secure unit review, the teacher assigned to provide instruction to \nthe special education wards stated that the teachers at the high school unit had \nfailed to provide him with daily assignments and work sheets. He also stated that \n\n38 \nwhen this occurred, he copied work from the textbooks he has available. Three of \nthe textbooks used by the unit's teacher were out of date. Examination of \nacademic assignments provided to five wards indicated that they were not related \nto the posted course standards. \nServices currently provided to wards housed in the lockdown units fail to meet \nminimum requirements for education in the least restrictive environment.  Special \neducation service delivery varies.  Although the services provided by teachers in \nthe Special Day Classes (SDC) at the main high school program were excellent, \nservices offered to wards in lockdown were viewed as deficient. \nSome special education wards are provided services through locked doors, with \nmaterials and assignments passed to them through an opening. Special education \nwards were observed receiving their \"work\" from the teacher assigned to the unit, \nwho returned later during the \"instructional hour\" to pick up and grade the \nassignment.  Interaction and conversation were minimal.  The teacher reported \ncontact hours for each individual ward visited.  The instructional effort and actual \nward contact observed did not warrant or justify reporting one hour of instruction. \nSpecial education wards were not observed receiving identified classroom \nmodifications and/or accommodations. \nN.A. Chaderjian \nDuring the past two years, the facility appears to have attempted to broaden the \ncontinuum of service delivery options for wards placed in the secure programs. \nThe security lockdown practices significantly impact the ability to provide \ninstructional services.  Both special education and general education wards on \nextended lockdown receive abbreviated l20-minute blocks of instruction. \nWards in the lockdown units are often not provided textbooks.  Five of the nine \nworksheets spot-checked in the units did not appear to be related to the course \nstandards. Instruction observed in two of the restricted unit programs did not \nappear to be related to the course descriptions. There was minimal access to \nlibrary services (monthly). \nTo date, the facility has failed to make any significant progress in providing \neducation to special education wards in the \"least restrictive environment\". \nWards have been restricted to these limited services for periods of up to 18 \nmonths, due to administrative lockdowns at the facility. Wards assigned to the \nlockdown units are not receiving appropriate and/or adequate educational services \nas defined by IDEA. \nWhen a disabled ward is excluded from school for disciplinary purposes, the \nschool must ensure that it is not excluding the ward based upon behavior that is a \nmanifestation (causal factor) of the ward's disability.  Routine and lengthy \n\n39 \nplacement of wards in high security units without regard for manifestation was \nfound to be a common practice, particularly for wards eligible for special . \neducation due to emotional or behavioral issues. The program fails to adequately \nprovide supplemental aids and to use a cascade of behavioral interventions prior \nto or during the extended restricted placements. They routinely deny educational \nservices to wards that have violated general program rules. \nSpecific components of the IEP's have not been fully implemented for many of \nthe wards placed in restrictive lockdown settings.  Behavior intervention plans, \nfunctional behavior assessments and IEP identified classroom modifications have \nnot been developed, employed or observed as required.  The program fails to \nmaintain adequate documentation of efforts in these areas. \nService hours, as indicated in the ward's IEP, are routinely shortened after the \nward has been placed on lockdown status in excess of ten days.  Reducing service \nhours due to limited class space in the program areas or to lack of teachers is a \nviolation of the intent of IDEA.  Educational decisions involving the provision of \nrequired services must be based on actual ward need and not on program \nconvemence. \nTeachers assigned to wards locked in their rooms provide only limited interaction \nand these exchanges do not support the service hours reported to the CYA  . \nObserved interaction between teachers and wards locked in their rooms invo lved \nthe teacher giving the ward an assignment, then returning later in the hour to \npick up the assignment.  This practice fails to provide the one hour of instruction \nand three hours of \"independent study/work\" as described in CYA   policy. Verbal \ninteraction is hampered by the fact that the solid steel door requires shouting by \nboth parties in order to be heard. \nThe facility's secure programs do not adequately ensure that all wards with \ndisabilities have access to a free and appropriate education, which emphasizes \nspecial education and related services to meet their unique needs. \nLyle Egan \nWard interviews with the teacher present indicated that general education wards \nin one of Egan's lockdown units receive 1 hour of instruction per week in cages. \nThe unit teacher reports that he was instructed by his supervisor to only issue \nelective credits to wards placed on the unit. When requested by the review team, \ndocumentation of this reported directive was not produced. \nWards in cages were not provided textbooks; they were provided ditto sheets that \ndid not appear to be related to the written curriculum or course standards. Review \nof a sample of academic assignments indicated that they were not directly related \nto course content or specific IEP goals. \nRestricted unit records revealed that some wards housed in the lockdown units for \nextended periods of time are denied access to school programs. It was observed \n\n40 \nthat one ward had been in the unit from November 2002 through April 2003  and \nhad not been provided any school assignments.  A second special education \neligible ward who was receiving reduced service hours while on the SMP was \nremoved from all services when placed in the I&J unit. \nInterviews revealed that wards placed on restricted status routinely have IEP \nservice hours reduced, based on the availability of special education staff and not \non need indicated in the individualIEP.  Wards' IEP instructional hours are \nroutinely reduced (N=II); access to FAPE requirements is routinely ignored. \nThis special education program failed to conduct IEP reviews for wards placed in \nthe special management program in excess of thirty days. A review of individual \nward IEP's indicates that in some instances instructional hours have been reduced \nfrom 15 hours per week to 5 hours per week. These service reductions have taken \nplace without timely IEP reviews. \nThe educational program fails to develop and implement mandated behavior \nmanagement plans; therefore, it has failed to provide the wards with the required \neducational options and benefits. \nOther specific findings with regard to the special education program are the following: \nReview of 6 IEP' s of wards placed in the O&R program in excess of thirty \ncalendar days revealed thatthe interim IEP meetings for five of the wards were \nnot held within the required 30 calendar day time limits. \nBehavioral goals were not developed for 3 of the 6 wards. \nCriteria for moving through the continuum of least restrictive environments, \nincluding a provision for returning to the prior IEP, had not been completed for 2 \nof the 6 wards. \nConsideration given to the need for a determination of manifestation is missing \nfor 3 of the 6 wards. \nThe IEP for one ward was found to contain transition goals scheduled to be \nreviewed 03/03.  This had not been done. \nA review and observation of wards housed on the Y &D unit revealed one special \neducation ward placed on \"red line\" status in excess of thirty days.  The ward had \nnot been allowed to attend school during this time.  There was a failure to review \nhis IEP goals and objectives, develop behavioral goals and implement his required \nservice delivery program dUling this peliod. \nObservation of portions of an actual IEP meeting conducted in the SMP revealed \nthat the ward, while present in the room (locked in a cage), was not afforded the \nopportunity to participate.  The two individuals making up the team conducted the \n\n41 \nmeeting at a table located some distance from the ward seated at a desk inside a \ncage.  The special education teacher listed as a participant was actually in the \nroom teaching during the meeting.  The team reduced the ward's special \neducation service hours based on his placement in the unit, despite the fact that he \nhad demonstrated his ability to successfully participate in the full continuum. \nIDEA regulations are clear on the requirements that an adult ward be an active \nparticipant in the IEP development and that input be solicited and considered. \nThis was not done. \nFred C. Nelles \nThere is a lack of standardization ofthe instructional program between the main \nhigh school and the restricted unit. \nWards attending school in the secure/lockdown units are often not afforded the \nopportunity to access a full instructional day. \nThe special education teacher assigned to the SMP is not required to develop \nlesson plans.  The materials provided to the wards did not appear to be related to \nthe identified educational goals and objectives. \nSpecial education wards placed on lockdown status in excess often days routinely \nhave the number of service hours reduced.  Often the reduction is significant, \naveraging 50%.  These IEP driven instructional hours are reportedly reduced \nbecause the programs offered in the secure area provide 120 to 180 instructional \nminutes daily.  When questioned about the reduction of services to these wards, \nthe principal indicated that she had been authorized to do so in a memorandum \nfrom the central office of the CYA  .  She was not able to provide the team with \ncopies of this document. \nOne ward's IEP, class schedule and supporting documents indicated that his class \nschedule was four classes (240 minutes of instruction) daily. The ward was \nclassified as \"green lighted\" (placed on security restrictions due to safety \nconcerns).  The ward was withdrawn from two of the academic classes listed in \nJanuary 2003; school personnel waited until March 10,2003 to assign him to two \nnew classes.  When the ward was assigned two culinary arts classes, the school's \nadministration was aware of his restricted status. The ward was immediately \nbarred from attending those classes due to his high suicide risk. \nThe policy clarification memorandum involving Special Education Supplemental \nServices #2002-01 Students in Restricted Programs written on October 10, 2001 states in \npart: \n\"For a special education student, an Interim Placement meeting shall be scheduled . \nand held within 5 consecutive days of assiglll11ent to a restrictive program (see \nattached YA 7.479).  The meeting shall be held concurrently with the treatment \nteam's Initial Case Conference whenever possible.  A review IEP team meeting \n\n42 \nshall be scheduled within 10 consecutive days and shall be held within 30 \ncalendar days of assignment to a restrictive program.  The review IEP team \nmeeting shall develop an alternative education program revised IEP, appropriate \nto the alternative interim placement, that shall include: behavioral goals, criteria \nfor moving through the continuum of least restricted environment including a \nprovision for returning to the prior IEP goals and considerations given to the need \nfor a determination of manifestation.\" \nThe files of four special education wards placed in the Special Management Program \n(SMP) in excess ofthirty days were reviewed: \nDate Entered SMP  Date of last IEP meeting \nWard #1  02124/03  03/20103 \nWard #2  12/30102  07/16/02 \nWard #3  03126/0~  03/27/02 \nWard #4  03/03/03  11/06/02 \nThe file reviews indicate that 3 out of the 4 wards (#2, #3, #4) placed in the SMP \nfailed to meet the required thirty-day IEP meeting time limit imposed in the above \nreferenced memorandum. \nMary B. Perry \nWards in the lockdown units were not allowed to have books or pencils in their \ncells. They were allowed access to educational materials during their I-hour of \nexercise time in the large caged area. Staff report that wards often refused \nschoolwork and preferred to socialize or exercise in that area. \nThe general and special education resource teachers assigned to the restricted unit \nregularly prepare and deliver appropriate educational materials to the wards.  The \nunit provided log documentation supporting the provision of required services. \nThe quantity and quality of materials furnished was considered to be sufficient to \nneed the wards' educational needs.  As noted above, actual ward access to the \nmaterials is highly restricted and limited. \nJack B. Clarke/Southern Clinic \nWards sentenced to the facility as \"parole violators\" are not afforded the \nopportunity to attend school.  During individual interviews, program staff \nindicated that they had on occasion identified wards with existing IEP's who were \na part of this population.  The wards were refused services due to their placement \nand not according to need. \nThe CYA has notified the review team that services are currently (post-review) \nbeing provided through a contract with the Franklin Outreach Program from the \nOrange County Office of Education. The contract provides teachers and \ninstructors for the population described above. \n\n-------------- -----\n43 \nRecommendations: \n1.  A system of individualized instruction based on the core curriculum should be \ndeveloped, so that the full curriculum can be consistently delivered to general \nand special education wards in the restricted programs, including cages. \n2.  Quality instructional materials should be available to the wards in the \nrestricted programs to ensure that their access to the curriculum is comparable \nto that of wards enrolled in the regular high school program. \n3.  Many wards receiving special education services in the CYA   restricted \nprograms are being left behind academically.  Greater emphasis should be \nplaced on ensuring that academic instruction, including rEP required \nclassroom modifications and accommodations, is delivered to wards in \nrestricted placements.  The CY A must develop procedures to closely monitor \nfull implementation of all IEP's to insure that they address academic \nachievement. \n\n44 \nArea of Inquiry # 11 \nDoes the eYA use cages to provide education to wards in an appropriate \nmanner? \nGeneral Education and Special Education: \nWhile not aesthetically pleasing, the use of cages as a part of the cascade of behavioral \ninterventions may, at times, be necessary to provide services to aggressive and highly \ndangerous wards. While the use of a cage may be necessary as a \"last resort\", it is \ndoubtful that its widespread use is the only appropriate behavior intervention available. \nSecurity or behavioral concerns are noted as the primary reason for denying wards access \nto less restrictive school placements.  Other behavioral interventions should be available \nand employed by facility administrators and staff prior to placement in cages. When use \nof cages is authorized for extended periods of time, there should be clearly defined \nentrance and exit criteria. Wards in cages were found to be generally compliant, and \naccording to teacher reports, were completing their assignments. General and special \neducation teachers at Chaderjian and Nelles, who are assigned to teach wards in cages, \nreport that often the wards continue to be confined in cages for extended periods of time, \neven when they consistently exhibit acceptable school behavior. \nWithout exception, wards assigned to cages for the school program are afforded only a \nlimited school day. It is common practice to routinely reduce service hours in wards' \nIEP's due to lack of facilities (an inadequate number of cages). At Egan, wards report \nreceiving one hour of instruction in the cages per week. The number of cages limits the \nnumber of wards that a teacher can teach at anyone time. For example, when a facility \nhas 6 cages, it results in a 6: 1 staffing ratio that is far below the 15: 1 staffing allocation. \nThe significantly reduced studentlstaffratio requires a greater number of teachers in order \nto provide each ward the mandated instructional hours. \nThe use of cages presents several issues with regard to the quality and quantity of the \neducational services provided. Observations of21 wards receiving educational services \nwhile in cages at Chaderjian and Egan revealed that wards are primarily instructed \nthrough the use of individual work sheets.  Textbooks are not allowed in the cage. \nAcademic instruction was observed to be unrelated to the core curriculum content. The \nlocation of the cages limits the teachers' abilities to interact with the wards on an \nindividual basis.  At sites where cages are located in the open areas near the cells of \nlocked down wards (Chaderjian, Egan), the high noise level of other wards was \ndistracting and disruptive to the educational program. \nRecommendations: \n1.  The provision of educational services to wards locked in cages is one of the \nmost restrictive behavior control options available. More emphasis should be \nplaced on prevention, early and accurate identification of behavioral problems \nand effective interventions, using research based behavior management \n\n45 \nmodels. The lack of a continuum of behavioral interventions at Chaderjian and \nEgan results in cage placements for extended periods of time.  It is \nrecommended that the CYA   restructure its continuum of behavioral \ninterventions. They should begin with a structured behavior management \nsystem in the classroom and include short-term alternative class placements as \npart ofthe main high school program. The use of cages should be considered a \nlast resort. \n2.  If the CYA   continues the use of cages, differentiated staffing and/or the \nconstruction of more cages will be required to meet the requirement of 240 \nminutes per day of educational programming per ward. \n3.  When being served in cages, the wards must be provided access to the core \ncurriculum and to the specific courses necessary to make satisfactory progress \nin their high school graduation plans. \n\n46 \nArea of Inquiry #12 \nOn a system wide level are wards with special education needs properly \nidentified and provided appropriate accommodations? \nGeneral Education and Special Education Findings: \nThe CYA lacks unifonnity in the identification and assessment of wards that have not \npreviously received special education services or been identified as eligible for those \nservices prior to their incarceration. The Student Consultation Team at Perry provides an \nexcellent example of an operational SCT that routinely identifies wards in need of \nspecial education services. This SCT also provides needed educational interventions to \nsupport the wards' instructional needs. The SCT's at ChadeIjian, Egan, and Nelles fail to \nprovide sufficient early interventions to insure wards' academic progress. The \nintervention model employed by these three facilities (ChadeIjian, Nelles, and Egan) \nfocuses on waiting for the ward to fail, rather than early SCT interventions designed to \nprevent failure.  At Chaderjian, Egan, Boss and Nelles, very few wards are identified as \npotentially eligible for evaluation for special education, and even fewer are served \nthrough SCT developed interventions.  SCT data reviewed at all sites indicate that wards \nin restricted or iockdown placements for extended periods oftime rarely receive early \nidentification and referral services due to their limited contact with teachers. \nSchool administrations at all CY A facilities reviewed treat special education and general \neducation as separate programs.  Fonnal and infonna1 comniunication between general \nand special education staff is sometimes limited. Teachers fail to adequately align \nindividual ward IEP goals and objectives with the required core curriculum.  At the six \nsites, 52% of the general education teachers (N=40) interviewed or observed were \nmaking classroom accommodations designated in individual ward's IEP's. General \neducation teachers at Chaderjian and Egan were reluctant to provide classroom \nmodifications or accommodate for the needs of disabled wards.  Documentation \nregarding the implementation of modifications andlor accommodations has not been \nadequately maintained system wide. \nSite Specific Findings: \nJohanna Boss \nSpecial Education Compliance Report summaries provided by the CYA   indicate \nthat during 2002 Boss had a backlog of SCT meetings (approximately 20) dating \nback to late NovemberlDecember due to the unavailability of SCT members. \nDelays in evaluations for wards suspected to be in need of services were noted \nduring the last months of 2002. \nThe program fails to document implementation of classroom modifications and \naccommodations by general education teachers. \n\n47 \nN.A. Chaderjian \nThe functional operation of the SCT could not be documented at this facility. \nThe most recent SCT documents and logs available for review were dated \nNovember 2002. \nAccommodations necessary for wards identified as hearing impaired are of \nconcern. The CYA   provides interpreters for these wards.  Observations of \ninstruction revealed that the interpreters were being required to explain and \nessentially teach concepts during class. The classroom teacher deferred questions \nto the interpreter, indicating that he/she should explain the subject matter to the \nward.  The appropriate role and function of the interpreter does not include the \nassumption of actual instructional responsibilities. \nThe program fails to document implementation of classroom modifications and \naccommodations by general education teachers. \nFred C. Nelles \nThe School Consultation Team Assessment Sheet provided to facilities by the \nCYA   states, \" Who Will Attend School Consultation Meetings?  The core team \nshould always include: an administrator/designee, a facilitator/chairperson, a \nrecorder, the student, the referring staff member, and treatment/custody staff (if \nbehavior precluded student from attending school\".  A review of the SCT log \ninformation indicates that during January and February 2003, three of four SeT \nmeetings were conducted without the required number of personnel present.  The \nSCT Coordinator, Assistant Principal and ward attended two meetings.  The SCT \nCoordinator, Assistant Principal, Psychologist and ward attended one meeting. \nThe SCT Coordinator, Assistant Principal, teacher, and ward attended the fourth \nmeeting; only this meeting was considered to meet membership requirements. \nMarch 7, 2003 CYA   SP-MIS documents report that in December 2003, 20 wards \nwere referred to the SCT, but only 5 of the referrals were reviewed; no wards \nwere referred to special education. In January 2003, 18 wards were referred to \nSCT, only 3 of the wards were reviewed; there were no referrals to special \neducation.  In February 2003, 31 wards were referred, 8 were reviewed and only \none ward was referred to special education. \nThe program fails to document implementation of classroom modifications and \naccommodations by general education teachers. \nLyle Egan \nMinutes of plans developed for wards in restricted programs indicate that SCT \nmeetings were held without the mandated members present. \nThe program fails to document implementation of classroom modifications and \naccommodations by general education teachers. Very few general education \n\n-----------------\n48 \nteachers indicate a willingness to modify instruction to accommodate disabled \nwards' needs. \nMary B. Perry \nThe program maintains an excellent SCT; the committee is viable and fully \nfunctional.  The SCT meets on a regular basis and routinely identifies wards in \nneed of services.  It is noted that SCT referrals for evaluations have been delayed \nfor extended periods due to the vacant educational psychologist position. \nSchool administrative staff strives to inform general education teachers of the \nneeded classroom modifications and they maintain good documentation of their \nefforts. Isolated instances of failure to provide IEP identified accommodations for \nwards placed in mainstream classes were noted. \nWards identified as hearing impairedldeafwere appropriately served.  The role \nand function of the interpreter is clear.  The classroom teachers take an active role \nin instruction and accommodate for these wards. \nRecommendations: \n1.  The designated members of the Student Consultation Teams should meet \nregularly at all sites and function according to policy to ensure appropriate \nidentification and evaluation of special education eligible wards. \n2.  In-service training on classroom modifications of instruction and \nimplementation of IEP required accommodations should be provided to \ngeneral education -teachers at all sites. \n3.  General education teachers serving wards in mainstreamed classrooms should \nbe required to maintain a record of all instructional modifications and \naccommodations. \n4.  Principals and assistant principals should be accountable for monitoring the \nimplementation of IEP required accommodations by general education \nteachers on a monthly basis. \n\n49 \nArea of Inquiry #13 \nAre the eYA educational policies and procedures adequate? \nThe CYA   has extensive policies to provide direction for the operation of the educational \nprogram.  These policies as well as revisions and policy handbook drafts were made \navailable prior to and during the actual site reviews.  The CYA   central office staff have \nmade significant efforts to use written policy to guide and assist school level \nadministrators on a daily basis.  Materials that were made available during initial \ninterviews at the CYA   Central Office were sometimes found to be incomplete, missing, \nor outdated when inspected at the individual sites.  Individual interviews with building \nlevel administrators, teachers, and support personnel indicate that educational policies are \nat times confused and interchanged with procedures and even the culture of the local site. \nComments and Recommendations Regarding the Youth Authority \nEducation Services Branch Manual \n3000 Education Site Plan Each site has an education site plan that meets this policy. The \nDeputy Director and his staff conduct annual site plan reviews. \n3100 Accreditation All of the sites are seeking W ASC accreditation. Sites are at varying \ndegrees of completion of the process. \n3110 School Accountability Report Card The report card does not exist and this policy \nshould be removed from the Policy Manual. \n3200 Attendance  The policy requires each site to maintain a minimum average daily \nattendance (ADA) of 15 wards per class. The policy allows each site to return wards to \nthe living units ifmore than 18 wards arrive at class on any given day; this section of the \npolicy seems to discourage wards from attending the school program. \n3225 Program Enrollment Standards This policy states that all wards are to be enrolled \nin the core program. This does not occur at all sites because there are not enough core \nacademic teachers. The policy also states that services are provided to maximize \ninclusion for wards with special needs. Frequently this does not occur, as many teachers \ndo not make accommodations for wards that have identified special education needs. The \nprocedure states that wards are enrolled in an appropriate high school education program \npursuant to the HSGP. Class closures and an insufficient numbers of credentialed \nteachers prevent this from occurring on a consistent basis. \n3250  Staff Workday Schedule This policy states that teachers shall work an 8-hour day \nand a 40-hour week. It was observed at Egan that this policy is not followed as teachers \nare permitted to leave school after their last class period. Teachers who teach a 240-\nminute day have more than I-hour preparation time for each 3 hours of instruction. \n\n50 \n3300 School Day Schedule The policy calls for wards enrolled in the high school and \nmiddle school to have at least 240 minutes of instruction each day, not including \nmovement and break time.  Failure to consistently follow this policy at the sites visited \nhas been noted in Inquiry # 6. \n3410 Career Vocational Advisory Committees This policy states that all career vocational \neducation courses will be accompanied by trade advisory committees. There was limited \ndocumentation at Chaderjian, Egan, and Nelles that this is occurring on a consistent basis. \n4000 Curriculum Development and Standards Well-written curriculum guides were \navailable in every academic area except science. Once the science curriculum is \ncomplete, they will comply with this policy. \n4050 High School Program The High School Program is designed to provide a sequential \ncourse of study to meet the requirements for high school graduation adopted by the State \nBoard of Education. Due to the lack of credentialed teachers noted in Inquiry #2, it is \n. very difficult to provide a sequential course of study for the ward popUlation to meet \nrequirements for high school graduation. \n4100 Guidelines for Curriculum Development This policy calls for a standing Education \nServices Branch Curriculum Committee,  School Curriculum Committees, and SUbject \nArea Departments for the purpose of developing, reviewing, and revising subject-area \ncurriculum guides.  Due to the shortage of academic teachers at some of the sites, subject \narea departments were not active at all of the sites visited. \n4130 Instructional Practices This policy notes that instructional practices shall include \ncourse syllabi and lesson plans. This is addressed in Inquiry #7.  The standard indicates \nthat the methods and modes of instruction shall be modified as needed to accommodate \nindividual ward learning needs. This is addressed in Inquiry # 12. \n4300 Supplementary Services  This policy says that the Student Consultation Team \nprovides appropriate supplementary services so that wards have access to the core \ncurriculum.  Adherence to this policy is addressed in Inquiry # 12 . \n. 4340 Individuals with Exceptional Needs This policy requires that all non-high school \ngraduates under 22 who are Individuals With Exceptional Needs (IWENS) have access to \nFA  PE and receive services for the learning disabled through an inclusion model. This \npolicy is addressed in Inquiry # 12. The inclusion model, when present, is rarely used. \nThe special education procedures handbook has been in draft form for more than 2 years. \n4400 English Language Learners This policy calls for services to be provided to English \nLanguage Learners.  In some cases, the needs of these wards are not being met due to the \nneed for more teachers in this area.  Where and when teachers are available, they are \nmeeting the needs ofthe youth. \n\n51 \n4500 Career Advisory Teams Consideration might be given to incorporating this policy \ninto Policy 3410. \n4560 Library Services A library exists at each site visited. The policy states that wards \nwill have access to the library at least 6 hours a day, five days a week. This is addressed \nin Inquiry #2 and Inquiry # 10. \n4600 Student Records  The Branch has the responsibility to establish, maintain, and \nretain adequate and accurate ward records.  This is addressed in Inquiry # 3. \n4650 General Education Development Test  The policy is being followed at the sites \nvisited. \n4700 California High School Proficiency Examination The policy is being followed at \nthe sites visited. \n4730 Standardized Testing and Reporting Program The policy is being followed at the \nsites visited. \nRecommendations: \n1.  CYA leadership needs to insure that all staff has access to current and \ncomplete educational policies. Consideration should be given to implementing \na statewide system of electronic access to policies and procedures, making \nthem available to all CYA   staff. This system would also allow immediate staff \naccess to any revisions of policy and procedure. \n2.  An agency wide monitoring process should be developed to insure continued \ncompliance with all policies and procedures. \n3.  The draft of the Special Education Procedures Manual should be completed \nand approved by the CYA   as soon as possible. \n\n52 \nAdditional Overall Recommendations: \n1.  Reassess the mission of the N. A. ChadeIjian and Lyle Egan schools. \n•  Consider decentralizing these educational programs and divide the \ncampuses into smaller units to make them more manageable. \n•  Adequate numbers of corrections officers should be assigned to supervise \nmovement, assist in the lunch process and be stationed in individual high \nrisk classrooms. \n•  Satellite the lunch program to the wards in the classrooms to minimize \nyouth movement and reduce opportunities for disruption. \n•  Since these sites have older wards, consideration should be given to \ndifferentiated programming, with an emphasis on GED and vocational \ntraining. \n2.  The CYA   should pursue legislation permitting the referral of adult wards \n(over the age of 18) to adult institutions when they refuse to participate in \neducational programs and pose a danger to staff and others. These wards \ncurrently disrupt efforts to provide quality educational programming for the \nremainder of the popUlation. ",

RG 03079344 \n16  Plaintiff,  STIPULATION REGARDING \nSAFETY AND WELFARE \n17  v.  REMEDIAL PLAN AND MENTAL \nHEALTH REMEDIAL PLAN; \n18  [PROPOSED] ORDER \nRODERICK HICKMAN, \n19 \nDefendant. \n20 \n21  1.  The Consent Decree required defendant to file remedial plans in all areas of this \n22  case by January 31,2005.  In January, the parties stipulated to extend the dates for the filing of \n23  remedial plans.  The January 31, 2005 Stipulation Regarding Youth Authority Remedial Efforts \n24  and the Mental Health and Rehabilitation Interim Remedial Plan filed in April, 2005, required \n25  DJJ to file remedial plans for Mental Health Care and Rehabilitation and Safety and Welfare by \n26  November 30,2005.  The extension of time to file these plans was based on DJJ's decision to \n27  reform California's juvenile system to a rehabilitative model based on a therapeutic environment \n28  / / / \nSTIPULATION REGARDING SAFETY AND WELFARE REMEDIAL PLAN AND MENTAL HEALTH REMEDIAL PLAN \n1 \n\n1  rather than simply to attempt to address the deficiencies identified by the expert reports, which \n2  were the basis for the Consent Decree, without undertaking fundamental reform. \n3  2.  Before the January 31, 2005 stipulation, representatives of the parties visited state \n4  juvenile facilities reputed to be exemplary in Missouri, Florida and Texas.  In February 2005, \n5  they visited facilities reputed to be exemplary in Washington and Colorado.  They agreed that the \n6  facilities visited were superior to those in California in increasing public safety, youth awareness \n7  of their impact on their victims and communities, youth skills and maturity; and in decreasing \n8  recidivism.  Based on the visits to other states and the advice of Consent Decree designated \n9  experts, DJJ developed the Programmatic Description of the Rehabilitative Model for CYA filed \n10  in May, 2005, and the preliminary Safety and Welfare Remedial and Mental Health Remedial \n11  Plans being filed contemporaneously with this stipulation. \n12  3. DJJ deteriorated over decades of neglect and attrition of resources to the \n13  unacceptable state documented by the experts' reports that were the basis for the Consent Decree \n14  in this case.  It was and is a tremendously challenging project to conceptualize and articulate \n15  plans to tum DJJ around from a dangerous and violent system with a paucity oftreatment and \n16  rehabilitative services and a very high recidivism rate (greater than 70%) to a system that would \n17   meet the mandates of state law and that would serve public safety and develop delinquent youths' \n18  skills and motivation to be responsible and productive citizens when they return to the \n19  community.  DJJ believes that the Safety and Welfare and Mental Health plans that it is filing \n20  are a guideline for a system that will be competitive with the best in the nation.  Plaintiff believes \n21  that the current plans are first drafts that still need a great deal of work.  The parties agree that \n22  detailed implementation plans still need to be developed.  Both parties think that the agreements \n23  they make now will result in improved conditions for youth and staff in the next few months and \n24  over the next year, and sufficient remedial plans with implementation details. \n25  4.  As soon as possible, but no later than January 3,2006, DJJ will retain the following \n26  nationally recognized experts in juvenile justice to further develop the Safety & Welfare \n27  Remedial Plan:  Chris Murray, Chris Baird, Fred Mills, Ned Loughran, and John Platt.  These \n28  \"planning experts\" will be directed to produce a revised draft Safety & Welfare Remedial Plan to \nSTIPlJLATlON REGARDING SAFETY AND WELFARE REMEDIAL PLAN AND MENTAL HEALTH REMEDIAL PLAN \n2 \n\n1  the parties for their consideration by March 30, 2006.  DJJ will file the final Safety and Welfare \n2  Plan by June 30, 2006.  If any of the experts become unavailable, the parties shall agree on a \n3  replacement (or that there is no need for replacement) without further filing with the Court. \n4  Should the parties disagree on a replacement or on the need for a replacement, the disagreement \n5  shall be resolved by the process set forth in Paragraph 34 of the Consent Decree. \n6  5. The revised draft Safety & Welfare Plan will be developed by the planning experts \n7  described above in consultation with DJJ, plaintiffs counsel, experts designated by the Consent \n8  Decree, the Special Master and others as the planning experts deem appropriate.  The planning \n9  experts will use DJJ's preliminary remedial plan as a guideline for their work.  When the \n10  planning experts identify policy options, they will present those to DJJ who will have the final \n11  decision on the proposed policy revisions. DJJ shall exercise its discretion consistent with the \n12  principles stated in the January 31, 2005 stipulation: \n13  a. Programs must be designed to provide habilitation/rehabilitation and success in the \n14  community; \n15  b. When reasonably possible and consistent with delivery of specialized programs, \n16  youth must be placed in the facility closest to their homes.  All treatment services must be \n17  designed to include families, except where neither practical nor determined to be consistent with \n18  treatment goals; \n19  c. Youth must be assigned to facilities and programs based on age, risk and needs \n20  assessment, and other appropriate factors; \n21  d. Facilities and programs should maximize youth/staff interaction, with living units \n22  and staffing ratios that permit adequate supervision and intervention; \n23  e. Facilities and living units should provide a safe and supportive environment that \n24  promotes rehabilitative goals; \n25  f.  DJJ shall emphasize positive reinforcement rather than punitive disciplinary \n26  measures; \n27  g.  Lockup may be used only as a temporary intervention in emergencies or as a last \n28  resort; \nSTIPULATION REGARDING SAFETY AND WELFARE REMEDIAL PLAN AND MENTAL HEALTH REMEDIAL PLAN \n3 \n\n1  h.  All staff that supervise wards must be qualified and will be required to provide \n2  rehabilitative and treatment services.  They must be provided with the training and support they \n3  need to succeed in their jobs; \n4  i.  To the extent feasible, programs should be based on evidence and/or best practices, \n5  or shall be evaluated for effectiveness; \n6  j.  Transition planning for successful reintegration must be provided to wards prior to \n7  release to the community. \n8  Plaintiffs counsel reserves their right to object to any ofDJJ's decisions on the basis \n9  that a decision is inconsistent with the Consent Decree or the January 31,2005 Stipulation.  Any \n10  such objections will be raised through the dispute resolution process outlined in the Consent \n11  Decree. \n12  6.  DJJ did not implement the interim measures it proposed under the Consent Decree \n13  to classify and house wards based on their security risks (in addition to their treatment needs), \n14  and it did not implement those or alternative measures under the January 31,2005 stipulation to \n15  identify wards most at risk of committing violent acts and separate them from wards most \n16  vulnerable to attack.  Pending implementation of the risk needs assessment as described in the \n17  Ward Safety & Welfare Plan filed in conjunction with this stipulation, DJJ will direct Chris \n18  Baird to prepare a revenue neutral interim classification plan to increase safety for youth by \n19  separating them from each other based on security risks, consistent with mental health treatment \n20  and rehabilitation needs, as quickly as he would recommend.  Unless justified by compelling \n21  reasons, DJJ will implement Chris Baird's proposed revenue neutral interim classification plan \n22  according to a timetable Mr. Baird recommends that takes into account DJJ's legal constraints. \n23  DJJ will measure the short-term impact on safety according to means that Mr. Baird suggests as \n24  meaningful.  Mr. Baird will consult with DJJ, plaintiffs counsel, the Special Master and Consent \n25  Decree designated experts prior to finalizing the interim classification plan. \n26  7.  In consultation with the court experts and plaintiffs counsel, DJJ will retain \n27  nationally recognized experts in juvenile mental health and rehabilitation services to evaluate, \n28  revise and supplement DJJ's mental health treatment programs based on popUlation treatment \nSTIPULATION REGARDING SAFETY AND WELFARE REMEDIAL PLAN AND MENTAL HEALTH REMEDIAL PLAN \n4 \n\n1  needs and evidence concerning efficacy of treatment interventions directed at those needs and, by \n2  May 30, 2006, to revise the Mental Health Plan to incorporate their work.  DJJ will file a revised \n3  Mental Health Plan by June 30, 2006.  Plaintiff reserves the right to raise any and all objections \n4  to the revised Plan that may be raised under the terms of the Consent Decree including those that \n5  she would otherwise raise now in relation to the Mental Health Plan that is being filed with this \n6  stipulation. \n7  8.  DJJ will retain experts agreed to by the parties to evaluate and revise the policy \n8  concerning time added to a ward's sentence for misbehavior with the goal of emphasizing \n9  positive reinforcement to significantly reduce the net amount oftime adds, consistent with sound \n10  juvenile policy.  DJJ will work with the expert to evaluate measurements on the use oftime adds \n11  and will report that information to the Special Master and plaintiffs counsel on a monthly basis. \n12  9.

Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant Secretary of CDCR for injunctive and \n25  declaratory relief to prohibit the illegal expenditure of taxpayer funds on policies, procedures, and \n26  practices that plaintiff alleged were unlawful under state law.

A comprehensive system is now in place to ensure that the DJJ provides for \n12  adequate and effective care, treatment, and rehabilitative services under the California \n13  Constitution and State law.

Issues to be examined were cited in federal and state court lawsuits \nfiled by the Prison Law Office (PLO). My charge was to answer a set of specific questions, and \nto make recommendations for improvements as needed. The areas covered in this report are the \nfollowing: \n•  Ward Classification \n•  Access to Lawyers and Ward's Rights \n•  Use of Force and Ward Safety \n•  Restricted Programs, including Special Management Programs and Temporary Detention \n•  Access to Religious Services \nTo complete this study, I reviewed current and draft Y A policies in each ofthese areas, as \nwell the entire manual for the Institutions and Camps Branch. Also examined were the content of \nY A training materials in the relevant areas. I reviewed statistical data provided by a broad range \nof Y A staff. The effort to  identify and assemble these data was greatly facilitated by Stephen \nStenoski and Van Kamberian, as well as from several staff in the Central Office such as Sterling \nO'Ran,  Tammy McGuire,  Mark  Blazer,  Mark  Gantt,  Larry Miranda,  Delores  Lozano,  Lisa \nLester, and the YA Ombudspersons, Carrie Womack and Sherry Ellis. Data were also provided \nby institutional staff at many Y A  institutions.  Few of these data were readily available and \n3 \n\nrequired special data collection and analysis from Y A staff. The support and cooperation of YA   \nstaff in this  effort  was  extraordinary.  It is  obvious  to  the  outsider that  most  Y A  staff are \nextremely  qualified  professionals  and  are  very  committed  to  the  agency's  mission.  Also \nexamined was a large amount of materials assembled by the PLO and the AG's staff that was \nhighly referent to the issues listed above. YA made available for my review, copies ofa random \nsample of videotaped extractions of wards from secure areas. In no instance was I denied access \nto any reports or documents, nor was I prevented from talking on a confidential basis with any \nstaff or wards. \nBesides paper reviews and analysis of statistical data, I conducted intensive visits to the \nfollowing Y A institutions: The N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility, the Heman G. Stark \nYouth Correctional Facility, the Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility, the Preston Youth \nCorrectional Facility, the El Paso De Robles Youth Correctional Facility, and the Ventura Youth \nCorrectional Facility. During these site visits I was usually accompanied by staff from the AG's \nOffice and Youth Authority Central Office Staff, Stephen Stenoski and Van Kamberian. These \nonsite visits were generally three days in duration. Over the course of the visit, I toured each \ninstitution and inspected all the restrictive housing units, as well as a cross section of regular \nliving units. \nInterviews with institutional staff usually involved individual one-hour sessions with the \nSuperintendent, the Parole Agent III, the Chief of Security, the Ward's Rights Coordinator, the \nRisk Manager, the Chaplains, and other staff. I also attended regular scheduled meetings of the \nUse of Force Review Committees, Institutional Classification Committees, Special Management \nProgram(SMP) Reviews, and the Suicide Prevention Committees. In the course of my facility \ntours, I had unlimited opportunities to talk with line staff, both Youth Correctional Counselors \n(YCCs) and Youth Correctional Officers (yeas). \n4 \n\nMost important, I was  able to  conduct completely private and confidential interviews \nwith nearly 100 wards at the facilities that I visited. Wards were chosen at random across all \nliving units, and represented different \"phases\" or behavioral ratings in each living unit. Wards, \nincluding those in SMP and TD units, were brought to a interview room for these conversations. \nUsually ward interview lasted from  30-45 minutes. I told them that I was talking to them in \nconnection with pending lawsuits filed by the PLO, and that my role was as a neutral fact-finder. \nI was neither an employee of the Y A or the PLO. They were free to participate in the interviews \nif they wished (only a few selected wards declined to be interviewed). I took notes but assured· \nthe wards that they would not be directly quoted. I was looking for general patterns and not \nspecific  allegations.  My intention was to keep their responses confidential, but I promised to \nreport their concerns to the facility superintendents or Central Office staff if they wanted me to \naddress specific issues. Many of the wards sought my help in getting answers to questions that \nthey had on a wide range of issues. I made it clear that I would report circumstances in which I \nbelieved that they or other wards were in danger. \nThese ward interviews were conversational in style, covering their views on the specific \ntopics of my review, but I also asked about how they were doing in school, what were their plans \nfor the future, how their families were doing, as well as any concerns that they might have about \nvisiting, mail, and telephone privileges. I always asked about their medical care. The interview \nalso probed whether they felt safe in their current living unit. I would always end the interview \nwith open-ended questions about \"the hardest thing for you personally about being in the YA  ,\" \nand any \"good or positive things that were happening because they were in Y A\" The wards \nwere very open and candid in their comments.  They usually thanked me profusely for \"just \nlistening to them.\" Several of the wards would show me injuries that they claimed were the result \nof attacks by other wards or were the result of use of force by staff. \n5 \n\nAt the end of each site visit I conducted a one-hour debriefing with the institution's \nsuperintendent in the presence of staff from Y A Central Office and, sometimes, staff from the \nAG's office. These meetings were intended to give some of my key observations, and to clarify \nareas of confusion. I wanted to have no surprises, and I wanted to let institutional staff correct \nany errors in my data collection or perceptions, as needed. \nAs to professional standards in the pertinent areas of my review, I examined YA policies, \nstandards available from the United Nations, the Welfare and Institutions Code, the American \nCorrectional Association, the Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators, and the National \nInstitute of Corrections. In some instances, I will be referring to standards that have been applied \nby federal courts to other youth correctional systems. My report is organized by the questions \nposed in the original charge to me by the AG's staff. \nI. CLASSIFICATION \n•  Does the Youth Authority have an appropriate classification system for the purposes of \nsecurity and programming? \nThere is a growing professional consensus that effective classification systems are central \nto the safe and efficient operation of correctional systems. In the 1970s, the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons  and  the  California  Department  of  Corrections  pioneered  the  use  of  objective \nclassification systems to manage offender populations. Almost all prison systems and most large \njail systems now employ objective criteria that are statistically associated with serious inmate \nmisconduct  to  assign  offenders  to  appropriate  custody  and  security  levels  within  these \ncorrectional systems (Laurel Rans, ed., 1982; Austin, Hardyman, and Brown, 2001). Correctional \nclassification systems are designed to reduce threats to the public and to increase the safety of \n6 \n\ninmates and staff. Objective classification approaches can also be used to plan for new facilities. \nOne lesson learned from objective classification systems is that large proportions of inmates can \nbe housed in lower levels of custody without endangering inmate, staff, or public safety. This \nmeans that systems can realize substantial savings in operational and capital construction costs. \nFormal systems of classification are less common in juvenile corrections. One reason for \nthis is that most states have only one long-term juvenile correctional facility.  Further, juvenile \ncorrections systems have been more focused on assessing treatment needs rather than on custody \nand security concerns. It is worth noting that many prison systems are starting to  incorporate \ntreatment needs  as  part  of their formal  classification systems.  The pressure  to  include non \nsecurity issues in prison classification systems has stemmed from litigation requiring that adult \ncorrections systems do a better job of identifying inmates in need of mental health or medical \nservices, including those offenders who pose a high risk of committing suicide. \nThe Youth Authority invests a substantial amount of staff time and resources collecting \ndetailed infonnation about its wards, but these data are not organized into an effective system to \nguide either security or custody needs. Typically wards are given a very thorough assessment at \none of the Y A Reception Centers during their initial commitment to Y A or after return due to \nparole  violation.  This  assessment coyers  the  initial parole consideration date,  the  maximum \nconfinement time, and the maximum jurisdictional date in the Y A,  and any special program \nrequirements  set  by the  Youth  Offender  Parole  Board.  Reception  Center  staff utilize  data \nprovided  by  the  committing  county,  but  also  conduct  an  extensive  series  of  medical, \npsychological,  educational, and social case histories. The Y A Reception Center also conducts \ndetailed interviews with the wards to determine the nature and extent of their gang participation. \nThe reports completed by Reception Center staff are very comprehensive, and potentially of \ngreat  value  in  determining  institutional  placements  and  treatment  planning.  It  is  unclear, \n\nhowever, whether this excellent diagnostic and assessment effort is readily and routinely utilized \nby those Y A staff who supervise the wards on a daily basis. Further, the Y A continues to cling to \nits traditional mission of providing treatment and training. This is an admirable goal, but YA   \nstaff also  acknowledge  that  the  ward  population has  become  more  violent  and  difficult  to \nmanage. It does not appear that the YA   has developed a coherent strategy that integrates security \nand treatment concerns. Fear of violence, and especially of gang behavior dominates the thinking \nof many staff in living units. Staff seem confused as to how to maintain the safety of staff and \nwards,  while still meeting the rehabilitative mission  of Y A.  Without a clear and  consistent \ncorrectional philosophy,  and  lacking a structured classification process, most decisions about \nwards are made on an ad hoc basis-with less than ideal results. \nThe Y A does employ one security classification form that screens for those youths who \ncan be safely placed in Camps or Forestry programs. This security risk classification points to \neach ward who might potentially qualify for placement in a minimum security Camp setting. The \ncriteria on this form have not been subject to a validation study, so YA does not really know if \nthis risk assessment effectively selects those wards who will function best in a Camp setting. \nRecently a ward assigned to a fire fighting detail assaulted his supervisor from the Department of \nForestry.  This  led to  a shut down on all Camp programs until the Y A could investigate the \nmatter.  While most youths assigned to Camps perform quite well, it is unclear if the  formal \nscreening process assists in making these placement decisions. I repeatedly heard from staff that \nscore on this classification instrument could be over-ridden, i.e., the ward who appeared to be \nCamp eligible was denied this option at the discretion of staff, or wards who did not appear to \nqualify for Camp placements were given waivers and assigned to minimum custody settings. \nThis screening form is filled out on virtually all new Y A admissions, but it is not used to \nmake assignments to any Y A institutions other than the Camps. A Y A working group led by \n8 \n\nSterling O'Ran has explored expanding this risk screening for making advisory decisions for \ninstitutional placements. This group did not arrive at a consensus for action, and YA   still does \nnot possess an organized risk classification process. \nReception Center staff make recommendations  for  institutional placements.  Typically \nthere are three placements options that are offered, these recommendations are prioritized by the \nClinic staff, but sometimes only one placement option is given. Because of legal requirements to \nseparate juveniles from adults, there are often very limited options to be recommended. Further, \nnot every institution has a full range of programmatic options such as formalized drug treatment \nprograms,  intensive  treatment  units,  or  sex  offender  treatment  programs,  thus,  the  choices \navailable to the Reception Center staff are even more limited. Moreover, the Y A has had shifting \nstrategies of not placing certain gang members  in certain institutions. This  further  limits the \nrange of placement options.  Once the recommendations by Reception Center staff are made, \nthese are forwarded to the Population Management Unit, which essentially checks to see if a bed \nin the chosen institutions is available.  The ward is then assigned to a given institution. \nAs part of this review, I looked at a random sample of approximately 20 files that had \nbeen processed by the Population Management Unit. This review included examining the case \nfile, the Reception Center reports, and the scores on the Camp Screening tool.  I could find little \nrhyme or reason to the recommendations for specific institutional placements. Recommendations \nwere not based on the severity of the commitment offense or the ward's prior criminal history. \nSince many of the wards had been in the Y A before, and were returning on parole revocations, it \nwas common that prior DDMS records were referenced in this placement reports. The allegation \nthat a youth might be a sex offender was often decisive in making a placement determination, \nalthough there  were unclear guidelines as  to  what constituted sex offending behavior, which \ncould  run  the  gamut  from  aggressive  sexual  assaults,  more  passive  sexual  contacts,  to \n9 \n\nmasturbation. The ward's age was generally the most important factor, followed by alleged gang \naffiliations, and other geographic considerations (wanting to generally keep Southern California \nwards in Southern facilities, and other youths at the Preston facility or the Stockton complex). \nThe Central classification process does not recommend the specific living unit to which \nthe ward will be assigned. This determination is made at the institutional level and is typically \nstaffed by the P A III.  The process includes review of the YOPB orders. It was reported by the \nPA III at the Heman G. Stark (RGS) facility that sometimes these orders were in conflict with \nthe law. Judges would set sentencing parameters for specific offenses that were incorrect, but \nwere  often  missed  by the  YOPB.  In  these  cases  the  Y A  needs  to  communicate  with  the \nsentencing authority and get the situation corrected.  This means that some wards are kept longer \nthat the law permits-opening the Y A to serious exposure on issues of habeas corpus violations \nand false imprisonment. The P A III at HGS told us that this was especially a problem for wards \nwho moved to several Y A facilities, because the new institutions did not recheck all of these \nfactors.  It is clear that this problem must be addressed and that clarifying the correct sentence \nmust be a Y A Central office responsibility and not delegated to P A IUs at the various facilities. It \nis too easy for cases to \"fall between the cracks.\" While we were told that this problem had been \nperiodically  found  at  HGS,  other  PAIns  confirmed  that  they  sometimes  found  similar \ndiscrepancies. \nIn making decisions  or requests to  transfer youths  to  more restrictive settings,  or to \nrecommend  facility  transfers,  the  Institutional  Classification  Committee  review  large  and \ncumbersome files for each ward. These files are not well organized and are not user-friendly. \nThere are no summary sheets that concisely list the main risk and treatment factors. Often the \nICC needs to puzzle over when and where certain events, such as attempted suicides, took place. \nThis process is pretty informal and often is influenced by an ICC member who reports that he \n10 \n\nknows  something  about  the  ward,  or  by  the  Gang  Coordinator  who  may  have  pertinent \ninformation. Also discussed is the ward's behavior while temporarily housed at the Reception \nCenter or in orientation or intake unit of the facility. It is not uncommon that the ICC asks the \nward their suggestions on where they should be housed. Placement in special mental health units \nrequires  the  concurrence  of facility  clinical  staff.  This  group  makes  an  initial  living  unit \nassignment and transfers the ward from the intake or orientation unit to  a regular living unit. \nThere appeared to  be significant variability in how the ICC process was  accomplished from \ninstitution to institution. The growing ward files are then sent to the units as the ward is assigned \nto a specific Youth Correctional Counselor (YCC). The living unit staff must wade through this \nsmall mountain of paper to develop their treatment plans. The PA   Ills conduct periodic audits of \nthe YCC treatment plans  to  ensure that they are being completed and followed, but there is \nsignificant variation among individual institutions in terms of how carefully the treatment plans \nare monitored. \nWards  are reviewed by the ICC at a maximum of  every 120 days or if a transfer to \nanother living unit or facility seems warranted. This reassessment process is also handled slightly \ndifferently at each facility, and the process is conducted in an informal manner. The ICC comes \nup with a preliminary recommendation that is usually presented by the ward's parole agent. \nTypically the ward is invited to these meetings and asked to give input into placement decisions. \nThe ICC members sign a form that shows they concur or disagree with the group's decision. No \nformalized instruments addressing risks or treatment needs are employed as part of this process. \nThe ward is asked to sign a form indicating that he or she understand the decisions, and that he or \nshe has the right to appeal that decision to the institution's superintendent. \nThere  is  also  an informal  and traditional  arrangement that  allows  superintendents  to \nrequest the transfer of a ward who poses a danger to others or who is in acute danger from other \n11 \n\nwards. Usually this is accomplished via telephone conferences between the superintendents of \nthe sending and receiving facilities. The Central Office Population Management Unit is informed \nonce these agreements have been reached. There is generally no Central Office review of these \nor other assignments to  living units unless a formal  complaint is  lodged by the ward.  These \ncomplaints are generally in the form of letters to the Director of the YA  , who in tum will send \nthese matters to the I&C Branch for review. \nThe absence of a classification system is further complicated by the recent closures of \nmany living units within the Y A. Put simply, there are fewer real placement options within each \nfacility.  Some facilities may not have Intensive Treatment (ITP) Units, and so these wards are \nusually transferred to other facilities  that have ITP units. Other facilities  lack formalized sex \noffender or drug treatment facilities. Although the Y A tries to  match wards with specifically \nidentified treatment needs to  living units that might provide for those needs, this is often not \npossible. \nAnother major problem for classification is that, unlike the Department of Corrections, \nthe Y A does  not rate its institutions by security or custody levels. With the exception of the \nCamps, all the other YA institutions are treated as if they are equivalent in security and custody \nlevels.  It is  generally understood that Chad and RGS  handle more difficult wards  and  thus \noperate with a higher concern on security issues when compared with Ventura or DeW'ift..\"\\Telson \nand Preston. Nelles and EI Paso De Robles are viewed as more security conscious than OR \nClose,  but  these  are  informal  understandings  and  are  not  formalized  in  policy or practice. \nWhereas the ITPs have enriched clinical resources, presently the Y A does not assign differing \nlevels of staffing to living units based on custody and security risks posed by the wards assigned \nto those living units. Most of the Y A facilities possess a mix of single locked rooms, open dorms, \nand unlocked rooms in some of the dorm units. Due to the shrinking population of the YA  , most \n12 \n\nof the rooms hold single wards, but there have been times in the recent past when many of these \nrooms were double-bunked.  Even the  single rooms are not necessarily appropriate for secure \nconfinement.  For  example,  at  Ventura  and  some  of the  other  living  units,  the  rooms  have \nelectrical outlets, and wards are permitted to have televisions, radios, or other electrical devices \nin their rooms. The potential for these electrical outlets to facilitate suicide attempts, fire setting, \nand other security problems is significant. \nSummary and Recommendations \nThe Y A employs an exemplary assessment approach that invests significant staff time \nand resources in knowing many aspects about the wards. Unfortunately, there is not an effective \nsystem to ensure that these data are incorporated in day-to-day custody, treatment, and training \ndecisions. While the YA   seems to do a good job at monitoring the development and delivery of \nindividual case plans, it is not at all clear that the Y A case work process is  grounded in the \nextensive casework process that begins at the Reception Centers. More important, the detailed \ninformation on wards is not systematically utilized for assignments to living units or facilities. \nYA   has become more focused on program assignments of wards to formalized drug treatment \nunits,  Intensive Treatment Programs, and Specialized Counseling Programs. It is  still unclear \nhow many wards that ought to be placed in these special programs are currently housed in other \nunits. \nAssessment data is not simply translated or summarized for those staff who supervise the \nward on current living units.  There is virtually no passing on of these assessment data to Y A \nparole staff who prepare the youth for return home, or to those field staff who must supervise the \nward on release. Because the detailed Reception Center assessments are not routinely repeated, \n13 \n\nthere are concerns expressed that these data are badly outdated for those youths who remain in \nthe YA for substantial terms. AdDlescence is a time of rapid change and development in a young \nperson's psycho-social development,  thus,  the  value  of the  excellent work  at  the Reception \nCenters  is  of diminished utility as  time goes  on.  In particular,  parole staff find  these  initial \nassessments oflimited value, and perhaps misleading. \nThe current assessment process is not very helpful in making custody decisions, with the \nexception of cases with  dramatic  psychiatric  problems  or immediate past histories  of gang \nrelated violence. While other juvenile correctional systems have been slow to embrace a custody \nfocused classification system, it is very common that prisons and jail systems across the nation \nhave adopted the sort of objective classification approach advocated by the National Institute of \nCorrections.  There is no inherent reason why custody classification would be in conflict with the \nprimary mission of the Y A-to provide high quality treatment and educational services within a \nsafe environment. Indeed it is  impossible to  imagine how an effective rehabilitative program \ncould be provided in unsafe  and  often  chaotic  living units.  Custody classification creates  a \n\"platform\" on which good treatment and education can take place. \nAchieving an NIC model of classification for the Y A is  very desirable for short-term \nward management and long-term institutional planning. This is a complex process that needs to \nhave unequivocal support from top management, especially from the I&C Branch.  There are \nmany materials available from NIC that could be used by YA   to  move toward an objective \nclassification process. \nLet me outline some of the critical tasks that must be accomplished by the Y A to achieve \nthis  objective.  The  YA  should  establish  a  high-level  management  group  to  implement  an \neffective custody classification system. This group needs to come up with standardized criteria \nfor categorizing each living unit in the YA   according to different levels of security and custody, \n14 \n\nsimilar  to  the  classification  system  now  being  employed  by  the  CDC.  With  the  possible \nexceptions of Chad and HGS, all other institutions will have various custody levels within the \nfacility. Next, Y A needs to develop a research-validated security classification instrument that \ncan be scored for each ward. This instrument should classify youths into differing levels of risk \nin terms of escape and serious institutional misconduct, especially assaults on staff and other \nwards. \nThe YA should examine the current security of the ward's current housing assignment, as \ncompared with the presumptive placement of the youth based on the validated risk instrument. \nThis process will reveal the mismatch between actual security and custody needs and current Y A \nresources  and options.  These data can be used to  argue for additional  facility renovation or \nreplacement that is more in synch with ward security needs. Further, the Y A should consider \ndeveloping new staffing ratios that are tied directly to  the security and custody needs of the \nwards under supervision. Further, the Y A should implement a full set of policies and procedures \nthat cover initial security classification and reclassification. \nSome  Y A  staff  have  expressed  concerns  that  a  focus  on  security  and  custody \nclassification would undermine the traditional focus on treatment and rehabilitation. This is a \n\"red herring.\" Effective treatment and training cannot occur in environments that are perceived \nby staff and wards as unsafe. Moreover, it is entirely feasible to implement a system of treatment \nneeds  assessment  that  is  appropriate  for  youths  in  every  security  classification.  Juvenile \ncorrectional  systems tend to  break down when security and treatment considerations are  not \nattended to with equal weight. Staff in such systems are given conflicting messages, and wards \nexperience these confused systems as examples of arbitrary and capricious decision-making. \nThe changes outlined above will be difficult and potentially costly to implement. The \nCDC spent several years to  fully operationalize their system of custody classification. In the \n15 \n\ninterim the Y A should consider a more moderate approach that systematically collects data on \nward security and treatment needs and  attempts to  make placement decisions that  are  more \naligned with the observed needs. Until staffing and physical plant deficiencies can be rectified, \nthe Y A could train its living unit staff on improved offender management techniques that have \nbeen demonstrated to reduce violence among high-risk inmates. One place to look is the Prison \nManagement Classification system that was tested by the Washington DOC and evaluated by \nNCCD under a grant from the National Institute of Justice. The Washington approach showed \nreductions  in  serious  institutional  infractions  in  one  prison  in  which  staff were  trained  in \nimproved inmate supervision techniques compared to another prison that housed very similar \ninmates. Y A staff generally lack sufficient training in managing different types of offenders, and \nthere are living units that clearly could benefit from increased levels of staffing. The preliminary \nresults from the Y A pilot project, in which the number of wards assigned to a living unit were \ndecreased, and staffing ratios were increased, suggest that YA needs to explore a more complete \nimplementation of this approach. An effective custody classification system would be the best \nway to actualize this new approach on a system wide basis. \nAs noted earlier, the excellent assessment data compiled at the Reception Centers are not \navailable to line staff in a \"user friendly\" format. These data are not routinely summarized and \nincorporated  into  institutional  or  system-wide  management,  budgeting,  or planning.  A  new \nclassification system should be supported by a management information system that could better \nsupport a wide range of Y A functions and activities. For example, institutional classification data \non security and  treatment needs  should be seamlessly passed  on to  the Parole Division to \nstrengthen reentry efforts.  No  such system currently exists.  Many of the problems that  are \ndiscussed below about issues of staff and ward safety, the use of SMPs and ward's rights could \nbe, at least partially, moderated if Y A possessed a competent correctional classification system. \n16 \n\nII. PHYSICAL SAFETY OF WARDS \nOn a system-wide level: \n•  Is the use ofp hysical force against wards by CYA staff excessive? \n•  Are chemical agents used in an inappropriate manner? \n•  Do CYA staffreceive appropriate training in the use offorce? \n•  Are ward-on-ward assaults, including sexual assaults and harassment, problem? \n•  Are episodes of excessive use offorce by CYA staff appropriately reported, investigated, \nand disciplined? \n•  Is staffon-ward harassment, including sexual harassment, a problem? \n•  Does the CYA appropriately house wards who are vulnerable to sexual assaults and \nharassment? \n•  Does the CYA appropriately investigate reports of assaults and harassment from other \nwards and staff? \n•  Do CYA staff receive appropriate training in monitoring and investigating assaults and \nharassment? \n•  Does the CYA appropriately protect wards from gang violence? \n•  Does the CYA have appropriate policies and procedures for protecting wards from staff \nand inmate assaults and harassment? \nBecause these multiple questions are highly inter-related, I will attempt to answer them in \na coordinated fashion in the paragraphs below. At the root, these questions address the concern of \n17 \n\nwhether the CY A is a safe place, and if the organization is doing all that it could be doing to \nensure the safety of wards and staff. \nIt is abundantly clear from a range of data that I collected as part of this review, that the \nYA   is a very dangerous place, and that neither staff nor wards feel safe in its facilities. One might \neasily conclude that  an  intense climate of fear permeates California'a state youth corrections \nfacilities. While the Y A Director Jerry Harper has taken important steps to rectify this situation, \nthe organization has  a very long road to  travel.  Let me summarize some of the data and my \nobservations, assessing the steps that YA   is taking to alleviate these safety concerns. \nVirtually all of the chiefs of security (COS)  at the institutions that I visited expressed \nconcerns  that  these  facilities  possessed  serious  physical  design  issues  that  made  security  a \ndifficult problem. Most YA facilities are 40-years old or older; even the newer living units were \nbuilt over a  generation  ago.  Whereas  the  CDC  has  been given  substantial  funding  from the \nlegislature to  build new facilities  and  to  enhance the  security of existing institutions,  capital \nexpenditures that have been approved for the Y A have been minimal. As one chief of security \ntold me, \"these places were not designed to be safe.\" He went on to point out myriads of \"blind \ni \nI  spots\" in which assaults could take place without staff being able to witness these attacks. This \nI \nsame COS showed me buildings in which broken windows and other readily available materials \nI \ncould easily be fashioned into lethal weapons. Living units had many areas in which security staff \ncould not see  what the wards were doing.  While there were cameras installed in many of the \n\\  living units, I observed that the on-duty staff did not know how to operate this equipment-i.e., \nhow to have the cameras get close-up views of individual rooms. In one instance, the staff could \nnot even find the remote control needed to work the cameras. Staff attempt to house those youths \nwho are at highest risk of suicide nearest to  the central security station, and they reported that \n\\ \nI  18 \n\nviewing the activities in the back of living units was especially problematic. Even camera rooms \nwere less than desirable, because in-room cameras were often vandalized by the occupants, or \ncovered with cloth towels, clothing, paper, human waste, or dirt. \nThe Ventura facility had many rooms with electrical outlets in the rooms. I was told that \nthis was a common design feature of many Y A single rooms (although not the newer units). The \npotential for  electrical outlets to  be used to  start fires  or to  facilitate ward attempts to  injure \nthemselves ought to concern the YA  . It was not uncommon that wards in some living units were \npermitted to have televisions, radios, and other electrical devices in these single rooms. Some of \nthese appliances can easily be used to fashion weapons, or can become part of an underground \nfacility bartering system among the wards. \nThe COS  staff also complained about \"dead spots\" in fences that were supposed to  be \nmonitored via cameras or by alarms. No COS felt that they possessed adequate staffing to achieve \na desired level of institutional security. While very proud of the professionalism of their staff, \nvirtually all of the COS staff asked that more training be made available to staff, especially in the \narea of the use of force. \nSome living units, such as the \"270\" units, are more supportive of security than the open \ndorms or older lock-up units, but COS  and other staff repeatedly complained that there were \nserious design flaws even in the newer units that made effective ward supervision very difficult. \nOften entry ways to outdoor recreation areas created \"blind spots,\" and the general disrepair of \nconcrete floors, steps, and fences appeared to me to create potenthllly hazardous conditions for \nboth wards and staff \nBecause most of the Y A institutions are so antiquated and in a general state of disrepair \ndue to budgetary priorities, many of the units lacked safe and effective methods of feeding wards \n[C:\\Documents and Setth,gslAndersM2lLocal SettingslTemplgwprintIBK's CY A l1egprt.doc] \n\nwho were confined to their rooms. Staff complained about the risks of \"gassing,\" in which wards \nwould throw an unknown and potentially toxic substance at staff who needed to enter the rooms \nto  deliver food or other materials.  In the  older living units,  one could see a  variety of staff \nattempts  to  reduce the  risks  of \"gassing\" via the  use of duct tape,  temporary fixes  involving \nwooden or metal strips attached to the doors, and other non-standardized security methods. One \nwonders if these \"patches\" create additional health and safety issues for both the wards and the \nstaff. \nPerimeter security was a major issue at every facility that I visited. Some of the facilities, \nsuch as HGS and Chad, once had security checkpoints as one entered the grounds, but these posts \nwere abandoned to consolidate security staff within the institutions. At other facilities the visitor \ndrives right into a parking lot ne.ar the front entrance. Once at the facility, the visitor goes through \na sally port and must provide a valid ID to the security. Never once was I asked if I had any \nweapons with me, nor was my briefcase or computer searched by Y A staff. Apparently having a \nphoto ID that corresponds to a name on the approved visitors list is sufficient to avoid a search. I \nnever passed through a metal detector of any type at the six Y A  facilities that I visited.  Put \nsimply, I was subject to greater security screenings at airports as I flew to Y A facilities than at the \nfacilities themselves. While I was told by staffthat approved visitors for the wards were subject to \nhigher levels of searches for contraband, however, I was unable to witness this myself. Moreover, \nI wonder if other visitors, including volunteers, workmen, and vendors, are examined any more \nclosely than I  was. This policy needs to be reviewed carefully by the Y A. Certainly the CDC \nI  imposes a much higher security standard in admitting visitors. \nMore generally, I found that Y A security policies were unevenly followed, if at all.  For \nI \nexanlple, it is YA policy that all staff and visitors entering an SMP or TD unit put on protective \n\\ \ni  20 \n\nvests.  The only time that I was asked to put on a vest was at the SMP in Ventura. No similar \nrequests  were  made  of me  at  other  lock-up  units  at  facilities  that  housed  wards  with  more \nextensive histories of violence or assaults on staff. Another troubling observation occurred during \nthe times that I was interviewing wards at the various institutions. The security staff would bring \nall of the wards at the same time to the building in which the interviews were taking place. This \noften created a situation in which a group of wards were sitting together in a small waiting area as \nI was conducting the interviews. According to staff, many of these wards belonged to rival groups \nand were supervised by one yeo. The staff would ask these wards if they were \"cool\" with being \ntogether. If the wards answered affirmatively, they were allowed to remain together. \ny A practices with respect to  wards having personal items in their individual rooms or \nlockers seemed inconsistent. I observed ward rooms that were filled with a range of materials that \nmight  be  regarded  as  contraband,  or  could  be  used  to  make  weapons.  Periodically,  facility \nadministrators would become concerned about the amount of personal items in the possession of \nthe wards. In these cases, with little advance warnings, the security staff would conduct room \nsearches and confiscate large amounts of ward possessions.  The wards were very resentful of \nthese  \"raids\"  and  were  doubtful  that  their  confiscated  personal  items  (including  family \nphotographs)  would ever be  returned  to  them.  While  it  is  abundantly clear that correctional \nagencies have the right and duty to monitor the personal items held by inmates in their rooms or \nliving  units,  the patently inconsistent  and  ever  changing  nature  of institutional  policies  and \npractices is not desirable. \nSecurity practices  vary widely  across  the  facilities  that  I  visited.  For example,  ward \nmovements are rigidly controlled by staff at some institutions, but they are much more relaxed \nand informal at others. These differing facility policies did not seem to be necessarily related to \n[C:\\Documents and SettillgslAndersM21LocaJ SettingslTemplgwprintIBK's CY A 'IJ0It.doc] \n\nthe potential dangers posed by individual wards or by rival groups. This is, in part, due to  the \nabsence  of a  clear  ward  security  classification  system  that  might  be  reflected  in  different \ninstitutional practices. The general Y A  approach to  safety and security appeared to  me to  be \nprimarily reactive in nature. The principle control device that was used by staff was lockdowns of \nwhole units or institutions, or immediate transfer of certain wards to TD units. There have been \ndocumented instances reported by the Office of Inspector General in which institutions, especially \nChad  and  HGS,  were  in  lockdown  status  for  weeks  and  even  months.  Stepped up  security \nmeasures are often geared up to  respond to the last problems, e.g., a group disturbance in the \nchapel, which might not happen frequently. Recently, the Y A has instituted the staff position of \nRisk Managers, who are supposed to compile statistical data about the time and place of security \nproblems,  and  to  identify  any  patterns.  The  Risk  Managers  provide  this  information  to \ninstitutional management staff, however, the degree to which these Risk Managers are funded \n(fully budgeted or just an additional job assignment for existing staff) varies  across  facilities. \nGenerally, Y A  administrators seem to  lack \"eady warning\" data about potential problems that \nmight be brewing before actual outbreaks occur. Typically, the gang coordinators are relied on to \n\"take the temperature\" of rival groups and to anticipate potential outbreaks of violence, but the \nY A has only recently invested in upgraded training and better Central Office support for the gang \ncoordinators at the individual facilities. \nData on Ward Safety and the Use of Force \nY A Director J eITY Harper has been instrumental in starting efforts to collect system-wide \ndata on ward safety and the use of force. These efforts, while laudable, are still in the pilot phase, \nand there is considerable variability in reporting across the Y A institutions, especially on the use \n\\ \n22 \n\nof force.  Greater attention is  needed on increasing the consistency and quality of reporting in \nthese crucial areas. I will summarize the data that I was able to collect with the able assistance of, \nTammy McGuire, Stephen Stenoski, Lisa Lester, and Van Kamberian. These limited data paint an \nalarming picture of violence issues in the YA  . \nPerhaps  the  most  conservative  measure  of violence  in  the  YA    comes  from  data  on \nsustained DDMS level B infractions. These are limited to wards who either admitted to serious \nviolations or were found guilty by the DDMS fact finders. Not included are violent incidents that \ndo not come to the attention of staff, or events in which a lesser DDMS violation is changed. This \nlatter  situation  might  occur  in  which  eye  witness  accounts  are  absent,  or  the  evidence  is \ncontradictory. \nThis very cons.ervative measure of violence reveals a stunning amount of violence in the \nYA  .  In  2002,  the  six  institutions  that  I  visited  accounted  for  over 4000  sustained  Level  B \ninfractions for ward on ward assaults and battery-at least 10 such assaults every day. \nLevel BOOMS Data for 2002 \nEPDRYCF  FCNYCF  HGSYCF  NACYCF  PYCF  VYCF \nAverage Population  598  471  956  651  574  570 \nWardfWard Sexual Act  6  28  8  9  5  0 \nWardfWard Sexual Assault  1  5  3  0  0  0 \nWardfWard Assault!

The different facilities have different rates of assaults per inmate \npopulation, however there is no clear explanation that accounts for these differences. \n[C:\\Documents and SettingslAndersM21Locai SettingslTemplgwprintlBK's CY A 123\"rt.doc) \n\n----------------------\nBesides the ward-on-ward  assaults  and  batteries,  there  were nearly  1000 incidents of \nsexual harassment, as well a number of sexual assaults by wards on other wards. Also in 2002, \nthere were 84 Level B infractions for wards who committed assaults and batteries on staff with \nweapons or vile substances (referred to as gassings). The Nelles facility stands out as having the \nhighest rates of violence, but the other institutions seem equally plagued by these events. These \nlevels of ward-on-ward or ward-on-staff assaults are unprecedented in juvenile corrections across \nthe nation. While there are no reliable data kept on disciplinary infractions in juvenile corrections \nacross the states, many national corrections leaders were astounded by the apparent frequency of \nassaults in the Y A. \nAs  noted,  each of the institutions uses  different categories  for  reporting either violent \nincidents or the use of force, necessitating the review of these data for individual facilities.· For \nexample, in 2003, HGS had an average population of 872 for the first four months of that year. \nDuring this  period,  HGS  reported  16  assaults on staff and 3 gassings.  From January through \nApril, 2003, there were 14 instances in which staff needed to use a pepper ball launcher to quell a \ngroup disturbance, and 1 alleged sexual assault. For the first four months of 2003. HGS had 2 \nward injuries and 4 medical emergencies that were serious enough to report to the Y A Central \nOffice. In addition there were 10 ward fights that involved multiple wards. In December of 2002, \nHGS experienced 26 group fights.  During the first four months of 2003, HGS used chemicals \nrestraints a total of 535 times, physical restraints were used 109 times, and mechanical restraints \nwere used 236 times. Pepper balls were used 10 times. \nAt Nelles there were 274 use of force reports that were submitted to the Central Office \nduring the first 4 months of 2003, mostly involving chemical restraints. There were 1,413 wards \n\"necessitating security dispatch.\" The vast majority of these incidents  involved fights  among \n24 \n\nwards. In two cases, the wards used weapons. The average population of Nelles during this time \nframe  was 439.  These  incidents  included 52  wards who  are  identified as  receiving intensive \nmental  health  services.  According  to  the  judgment  of Nelles  administrators,  none  of these \nsituations  involved  \"unnecessary or  excessive\"  use  of force,  although  these  terms  are  only \ngenerally defined in YA   policies. \nPreston reported only 242 uses of restraint between January 1 and-April 30, 2003, and EI \nPaso De Robles had 237 use of force reports in this same period. The El Paso De Robles report \nnotes that the institution was \"averaging 1.1 macings a day. With our population decreasing and \nthings calming down, staff are reacting at the appropriate times.\" Chad reported 482 use of force \nincidents  involving  812  wards.  There  were  284  incidents  involving  chemical  restraints,  80 \ninstances of physical restraints, and 19 incidents invo.1ving the use of mechanical restraints. There \nwere also 19 cases in which less than lethal force (e.g., pepper ball launchers) were used. \nOther Data Sources \nThe picture of frequent violence in the YA   is further supported by letters that wards and \ntheir parents write to the Ombudspersons or the Director of the Youth .Authority. I reviewed all \nthe letters received by the Director for the first six months of2003. Of the 136 letters written from \nwards or their parents at all Y A institutions, 23 expressed concerns over physical safety, another \n18  involved  transfer  requests,  which  often involved  issues  of ward  safety,  and  16  involved \ncomplaints about staff misconduct, especially verbal abuse. Letters about ward safety were most \nlikely to come from Nelles, HGS, and Chad.  Letters received by the Ombudspersons showed a \nconcentration  of safety  issues  at  HGS  and  Nelles.  Ward  complaints  over  safety  issues  and \nexcessive  force  also  appeared  in  grievances  filed  by the  wards,  but were  less  frequent  than \n[C:\\Documents and Settings\\AndersM2lLocal SettingslTemplgwprintlBK's CY A l2'5'rt.docj \n\ncomplaints of about everyday denials of requested services. As will become clearer later in this \nreport, the Ward Grievance System (WGS), does not have very high confidence among the youths \nconfined in Y A institutions. The wards utilize the WGS to solve very basic issues and do not view \nthe WGS as effective when the complaints are directed at staff actions. Consequently, the WGS is \nprobably not giving the YA administration a complete picture of the issues faced by the wards. \nMy confidential interviews with almost 100 wards and with several staff were consistent \nwith the statistical data presented above.  Few youths felt  that the Y A was a safe place to be \nconfined.  Those who reported feeling  safe explained to  me that they managed their personal \nsafety either by (1) keeping a very low profile, or (2) aligning themselves with others to band \ntogether for protection. Few wards felt that staff were responsible for the unsafe conditions. The \ntypical response was that \"this is a jail and it is filled with dangerous people.\" Many wards felt \nthat the staff did what they could to provide safety, but that the YCCs and YCOs were generally \nunable to prevent the frequent violent attacks of wards on wards. In only a few cases did wards \ncomplain that individual staff knowingly placed wards in harm from other wards. Although there \nis  no  absolute  way  to  check  this  impression,  it  appeared  that  the  Y A  is  well  focused  on \ninvestigating complaints that staff are exacerbating institutional violence. This Y A Central Office \nfocus is a result of revelations several years ago that some Y A staff facilitated fights among rival \ngang members-the \"Saturday Night Fights.\" It appears that Y A staff are very concerned about \ntrying  to  isolate  wards  who  might  attack  each  other,  although  these  efforts  seem  not  to \nsubstantially reduce the level of institutional violence. \nThe  primary  staff response  to  cl).rtailing  institutional  violence  is  the  use  of  gang \nintelligence  information,  the  frequent  resort  to  lockdowns  of living  units,  expansive  use  of \ntemporary detention, the DDMS  system, and prosecuting wards in local juvenile and criminal \n26 \n\ncourt systems. While there are treatment programs that cover anger management and avoiding \ngang involvement, there is little evidence that these programs are having any positive impact on \ninstitutional violence. The dominant YA   response to ward violence is reactive and after-the-fact. \nPreventive strategies are either nonexistent or very rudimentary. For example, I sat in on a \nnumber of meetings of the institutional use of force committees. These meetings typically went \nover statistical data on the number of incidents that happened in the preceding several months. \nThe general sense of the meetings was for staff to convince each other that either \"things were \ngetting better,\" or that no  specific actions were required. There seemed a consensus that more \nprosecutions and harsher DDMS sanctions could help make the institutions safer. Many staffwere \nconcerned that Central Office edicts that limited the use of the SMPs or required shorter stays in \nthese units were not promoting safety. I never observed institutional managers planning proactive \nefforts  to  reduce the  level  of violence  at  their  facilities.  The  focus  on reactive  and punitive \napproaches to ward violence has necessarily led to more formality in the investigative process (to \nmeet due process and equal protection concerns), and was consuming ever larger amounts of \nmanager's time at both the institutional and Central Office levels. \nBoth wards and staff suggested that the most vulnerable youths were those with mental \nhealth problems, those labeled as homosexuals or as sex offenders, or wards who were attempting \nto disengage from their prior gang affiliations. Open dorms were viewed as the most dangerous \nhousing assignments, although attacks sometimes occurred in the lockup units. The classrooms, \nvocational areas, and recreation areas were also prime areas in which group fights or individual \nattacks were common. There were periodic group disturbances that broke out in the chapels. \nOnly Chad had a living unit devoted to wards who pledged to remain not involved in gang \nactivities.  Staff at Central Office and at almost all of the institutions talked about the possible \n[C:\\DocW11ents and Settings\\AndersM2lLocal SettingsITemplgwprint\\BK's CYA  '2'lJDrt.docj \n\n----------\nneed for a protective custody classification and specialized housing arrangements. While some \nY A staff expressed concerns that PC units created a different set of ward management issues, I \nwas repeatedly told by superintendents and security staff that many wards attempted to achieve \nsome measure of personal safety by getting placed in mental health units (ITPs and SCPs) where \nthere was somewhat enriched staffing and single rooms. YA   staff also reported that some number \nof wards in the TD or SMP units tried to get into these programs as a means of self-protection. \nSome wards would build up  a legacy of conflict with other wards,  and saw transfer to  other \ninstitutions as their only option. The absence of an effective YA   custody classification system and \nthe  limited  array  of housing  options  makes  the  protection  of especially vulnerable  wards  a \nchallenging responsibility.  Ironically, institutional  staff and  some wards reported that  Central \nOffice policies that are designed to better regulate entrance into mental health or SMP programs \nlimited their ability to use these existing options to provide a measure of short-term safety. \nA topic that came up in many of the ward interviews was the problem of individual wards \nbeing designated as \"Green lighted,\" \"Black lighted,\" or \"Rainbow lighted.\" If a ward is under \none of these  \"lights,\" this is  a signal that other wards are encouraged to  violently assault this \nward.  Green lights and Black lights refer to  attacks by Latino or African American wards. A \nRainbow light means that all the wards are encouraged to attack.  It is wards who place other \nwards under the \"lights\" designation. The wards who believe that they are in these categories \nexpress tremendous fears for their safety. They are reluctant to attend school or be placed in living \nunits  with  open  dorms.  Often  these  wards  request  transfers  to  SMP  units  or mental  health \nprograms for self protection. In some cases, the wards demand transfers to other Y A institutions \nto  avoid attack. \"Lighting\" feeds  into the intense climate of fear among the wards, especially \n28 \n\nthose who fear that they will be placed in this category due to relatively minor slights against \nother wards, or to rumors. \nStaff readily acknowledge the existence of the \"lights\" system.  The staff explain that, \nwhile some of the wards in this  category are viewed as  \"snitches\" by fellow wards,  the most \ntypical reason for being in this endangered group is to engage in verbal disrespect of other wards. \nThe offended party then rallies his friends and gang members to retaliate against the offender. For \nsome gangs, attacking a \"lighted\" ward is a point of honor among peers. Y A staff often describe \nthese vulnerable wards as \"window warriors,\" meaning that they yell insults at other wards from \nbehind their locked doors, Apparently, this verbally hostile behavior is fairly common in the SMP \nand TD units. According to YA staff, the \"window warriors\" are not so much dangerous gang \nme~bers as extremely immature wards who get themselves in trouble by provoking others. \nThe problem of \"lights\" existed at  all of the facilities that I visited, but was the most \nprevalent at Nelles. The staff generally resolve the \"lights\" issue by informal conflict resolution \napproaches. YA staff, including the gang coordinators will talk to the offended parties and try to \nnegotiate some diminution of tensions and violence. The staff may actually arrange meetings of \nwards in which the offender and offended are asked to work out a compromise solution that ends \nthe threat of violence. If YA   staff believe that they cannot help resolve these problems, they may \nsupport recommendations for transfers to other living units or other facilities. However, many of \nthe attacks occur in common areas such as the schools, recreation areas, or the dorms, and the \nstaff cannot prevent all of these assaults from occurring. The general attitude of the staff is to \n\"work around\" the problem of \"lights,\" and they are often ambivalent towards the endangered \nward who  they believe contributed to  this  potentially violent situation.  Each institution has  a \nsomewhat different policy of how they deal with \"lights.\" While the Central Office management \n[C;\\Documents and SettingslAndersM21LocaJ SettingslTemplgwprintIBK's CY A ~rt.docl \n\nsupports a \"zero tolerance\" of the phenomenon of \"lights,\" the Y A has yet to adopt a coherent \napproach aimed at ending the practice. \nUse of Excessive Force By YA Staff \nSuspicions that Y A staff were engaging in the use of excessive force were found to be \nwell  grounded in a number of audits and investigations that were conducted by the Office of \nInspector General (OIG). These reports documented the dangerous and potentially fatal use of \nhigh-powered weapons that delivered chemical agents. These chemical restraints were designed \nby their manufacturers to be used by correctional staff to quell riots that broke out in prison yards, \nbut Y A staff were using these same powerful chemical agents during extractions of wards from \ntheir rooms and other secure areas. Since these powerful chemical agents absorbed the oxygen in \nthe small ward rooms, there were real dangers that Y A inmates could be asphyxiated. The OIG \nalso found instances of wards who had received severe bums to their skin because they were not \npermitted timely access to showers after being sprayed. Numerous other problems in the use of \nforce were identified by the OIG at Chad and HGS. But, the most dramatic physical abuses of \nwards were found at El Paso De Robles. The OIG found that wards at Paso were made to spend \nlong periods of time on their knees with their hands bound behind them in mechanical restraints. \nIn some cases the wards were made to kneel on sharp surfaces that increased their discomfort. \nThis was called by staff \"Gym TD.\" Other wards were made to strip down to their boxer shorts \nand were forced to sleep on cement slabs in very cold rooms. Some staff also struck the wards \nduring  these  situations.  Based on the OIG report  and  internal  reporting,  the  Y A  launched a \nnumber of internal affairs investigations resulting in several early retirements and some transfers. \nThree  cases were referred to  the local  District Attorney's  Office.  One case was  successfully \nprosecuted. The seeming inability of top Y A management to appropriately respond to the findings \n30 \n\nof the OIG in 2000 and 2001 in areas of excessive force led to the recruitment of Jerry Harper, a \nformer Under Sheriff from Los Angeles County. Harper had successfully reformed several illegal \npractices  in  the  LA  County  Jail,  and  he  possessed  the  reputation  as  a  \"no  nonsense\"  law \nenforcement professional who could clean up bad correctional practices. Harper was an outsider \nto  the Y A bureaucracy who came in with a mandate for change. The OIG suggested that staff \ntraining needed to be significantly upgraded, and there needed to  be far greater Central Office \noversight as to the use of force at various institutions. Thus, it was not at all surprising, given the \nOIG reports and media accounts in the Los Angeles Times about abuses of force at Nelles and \nHGS, that the plaintiffs lawyers in Stevens v. Harper would raise the issue of excessive force in \ntheir pleadings before the court. \nAs with other Y A correctional issues, statistical data on the use of force are scant and not \nconsistent across the facilities. Central Office staff review only a fraction of potential incidents \ninvolving  force,  and  the  primary responsibility  for  investigating  these  issues  rests  with  the \nsuperintendents of each facilities. There are not very extensive reports that are available to assess \nthe thoroughness and quality of these local investigations. Behavioral reports that are prepared by \nYA staff to accompany these serious incident reports (SIRs) are often very brief and not very \nhelpful  in  understanding  what  transpired.  At  virtually  all  of the  institutional  use  of force \ncommittee meetings there are concerns expressed about the thin content in the behavioral reports \nand the need to train Y A staff to produce more in depth and detailed accounts of these incidents. \nWard Interviews Qn Use of Force \nDuring  confidential  interviews  with  over  100  wards,  I  asked  vanous  questions  about \nwhether these youths had been physically or sexually abused by the staff. I asked about staff abuse in \na variety of ways, and only after I had established a rapport with the ward and he or she was talking \n31 \n\nfreely to me about their experiences in Y A. There were only one or two instances in which wards \nrelated stories  about the  alleged  abuse  by staff.  These wards would show me  injuries  that they \nattributed to  staff physical  abuse  such  as  twisting mechanical restraints  too  tightly or allegedly \nthrowing a ward against a wall. In these cases I worked with the assigned Y A staff Stephen Stenoski \nor Van Kambarian to further research these claims. They were unable to come up with any reports or \nrecords  indicating whether  excessive force  was  used.  The  attached behavioral reports  that  were \nforwarded to me about these youths were generally not very detailed, and it was unclear from the \nreports  whether unusual  force  had,  in  fact,  been used.  In  one  case,  the  staff member had been \ninvestigated by Central Office, but no adverse staff actions were taken as of this date. \nMost of the wards did not feel that they had been personally subjected to excessive force, \nnor did they report being witness to others being physically harmed by staff. The wards told me that \nstaff used force to stop fights. While they did not relish being sprayed by chemicals as part of staff \nactivities, the vast majority of the wards felt that the staff were not attempting to use excessive force. \nTheir attitude was that some wards provoked staff reactions by their own behavior and that the staff \nuse  of force  was appropriate.  Several wards  suggested that some staff who came to  work were \nexperiencing \"bad days\" and this might lead to short tempers and increase the likelihood that these \nstaff would perceive ward behavior as threatening to the staff. \nIt should be noted that virtually all of the Y A wards that I interviewed had spent time in \ncounty juvenile detention centers. It is fairly common that county staff use chemical and physical \nrestraints in these institutions, so the Y A wards may have perceived their treatment by Y A staff as a \ncontinuation of the expected treatment of young inmates of California juvenile justice institutions. \nFurther, many of these young people have endured long personal histories of violence directed at \nthem by family members, gang peers, and other law enforcement personnel. It is quite possible that \nthese young people find it difficult to gauge the level of physical abuse against them that actually \n32 \n\ncrosses  the  line  of acceptable  adult  behavior.  I could  not  unequivocally conclude  that  isolated \nincidents of staff use of excessive force did not happen. But, my ward interviews suggested that such \nbehavior was not widespread or systemic in the Y A. \nThe same positive report cannot be made about staff verbally abusing the wards. There was \nalmost  unanimous  complaints  among  the  wards  that  Y A  staff  make  demeaning  and  angry \ndetrimental comments to the Y A wards on a daily and routine basis. One of the Y A Ombudspersons \nreported to me that she received many complaints from wards about verbal abuse of staff and that \nthe youths were routinely disrespected by staff.  This  Ombudsperson observed that verbal  abuse \nseemed to be \"inherent in the staff culture,\" and she wondered why staff come to believe that their \nbehavior was therapeutic. \nA review of ward grievances that were filed between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2003, \nrevealed  that  there  were  99  complaints  about  staff disrespectful  behavior  at  Chad,  79  such \ngrievances at HGS, 105 similar grievances filed by wards at Preston, and 112 grievances at Ventura. \nStaff disrespect was the basis of 36 and 19 ward grievances that were filed at EI Paso DeRobles and \nNelles, respectively. \nThe wards complained about demeaning comments by staff that communicated to  them \nthat the staff felt that the wards were worthless and had no chance for rehabilitation. Negative staff \ncomments  also  extended  to  the  wards'  family  members.  Reported  verbal  abuse  often  involved \nexpletives and coarse language. Wards told me that some staff routinely yelled in close proximately \nto their faces, attempting to elicit a physical response that could lead to disciplinary writeups, the use \nof temporary detention, or the escalation to the use of chemical restraints. While few of the Y A \nwards complained about racially hostile statements by staff, there were several concerns about staff \ncomments about the wards that suggested that they engaged in homosexual behavior with other \nwards. Some courts have held that this verbal harassment of inmates by staff constitutes a violation \n33 \n\nof their rights. Few correctional experts would defend these practices as beneficial in terms of the \ntreatment process. Indeed, adapting the military boot camp model in juvenile correctional programs \nhas not been shown to be effective. There is even some speculation that harsh verbal behavior by \nstaff makes facilities more dangerous for staff and wards. \nY A staff did not deny that these verbal exchanges took place.  Some managers felt that \nsome staff believe this rough language can motivate the wards to improve themselves. The model \nthat they had in mind was the stereotype of the military drill sergeant who constantly berated the \nnew members of his unit. Other YA   staff explained that the wards often used negative epithets in \nverbal interactions with them. YA   were simply giving back the verbal hostility that they were getting \nfrom the Y A wards. \nMany Y A institutional managers criticized the use of verbal abuse by staff. They argued \nthat the staff should not try to \"act like wards,\" and that there was a clear need to maintain a standard \nof professionalism. For example,  such verbal  abuse would not be tolerated by law enforcement \nofficials during their interactions with citizens, including those that were being taken into custody. \nThere was a range of opinions among YA   managers as to whether they could do very much to stop \nthe  verbal  abuse.  There  had  been  some  inquiries  and  investigations  about  individual  staff, \nparticularly as a result of grievances filed by wards. However, staff action grievances often took a \nlong time to complete. Union agreements and other state personnel rules made it quite difficult to \nenforce sanctions against offending staff members. \nThe reported  extensive  use  of verbal  abuse by staff,  and  the  dubious  theory that this \nbehavior could be a positive motivational tool, is reflective of the very limited amount of training \nthat YA staff have received on ward management issues. Staff are asked to perform a difficult job, \nmanaging many youths with severe behavioral and mental health problems. Training and ongoing \n34 \n\ncoaching on the most effective strategies of managing ward behavior by supervisors with their line \nstaff appears to be quite limited. \nSecure Area Extractions \nForce is  used by the Y A primarily in connection with stopping ward-on-ward fights  in \ncurtailing group disturbances. However, another set of situations in which force is exercised is in \nconnection with extraction or removal of wards from secure areas, principally their rooms. These \nevents often entail significant risks of injury to both the staff and wards. A relatively new Y A policy \nrequires that all of these extractions be videotaped. As part of this review, I requested permission to \nview random samples of these videotapes. The YA complied with my request, and I was able to \nview 36 such videos from Chad, HGS, Nelles, and Preston. A smaller number of these extractions \noccurred at El Paso De Robles, but they also provided all of the tapes that they had completed in the \nlast year. At this writing, I have not viewed the EI Paso De Robles tapes. In some cases, I watched \nthe tapes as part of a use of force committee meeting that was convened at the institution that I \nvisited. Since the tapes are numbered differently at each facility, I would generate a random set of \nnumbers and YA   Central Office staff would acquire copies of the selected tapes from each facility. I \nwatched the collected tapes at Y A headquarters, usually with Stephen Stenoski and Van Kambarian \nin attendance. In two of these sessions, AG staff were also in attendance. In addition to the specific \ntapes, I had the benefit of reviewing all of the behavioral reports written by staff in the wake of these \nsecure area extractions. \nThe first impression one gets in viewing these secure extractions is that Y A staff are still \nlearning the protocols for videotaping these events. The tapes often ended when the camera batteries \nor tape ran out. The tapes did not necessarily cover the entire duration of these incidents. It was clear \n35 \n\nthat the YCOs were not entirely clear on the purposes of the taping. For example, many of the tapes \ndid not describe in sufficient detail the reasons for the room removals.  The Y A would use very \ngeneric language \"for the good order of the institution,\" but there was little concrete information \nabout the particular risks that were being responded to by the security staff. Further, the videos rarely \ncontained a verbal description of the steps taken by the staff to resolve the problem without use of \nforce.  The videos seem to be focused on showing the sequence and extent of use of chemical or \nother restraints. The accompanying behavioral reports that were submitted by staff were equally thin \non details as to the reasons force needed to be used or the alternative conflict resolution approaches \nthat were attempted. The written reports were generally focused on the amounts and timing of the \nuse of various methods of restraint that were employed in the secure area extractions. In one or two \ninstances of the videos that I reviewed, the written files were empty. \nIt was  often quite  difficult,  in viewing the  secure extraction videos,  to  understand  the \nnecessity to escalate the use of force. A very typical scenario involved a ward who was refusing to \ncome to the  door of his  room and submit to  being handcuffed.  In some instances the ward had \nbarricaded himself under a mattress. Another apparent reason for a secure area extraction was a ward \nwho had placed a towel or paper over the door window. Often, as the YA staff would open the door \nfor  the  first  use  of chemicals,  these  window  blockages  would  be  pulled  down,  however  the \nextraction  would  continue  until  the  ward  submitted  to  being  placed  in  mechanical  restraints. \nSometimes the tapes or the written reports indicated that the ward was refusing to come out of the \nroom, or that he had created a disturbance by banging on the door or making excessive amounts of \nnoise. The video would generally show the staff giving a curt warning that chemical restraints would \nbe used if the ward did not comply with staff requests. The balance of the video would document the \nsequence in which force  was  escalated,  including the use of pepper ball launchers  and physical \nentrance by YCOs. There was  little evidence in the videos or in the accompanying files that the \n36 \n\nYCCs had reviewed or were briefed by mental health or medical staff on any pertinent issues that \nmight be useful in responding to the situation. \nIn every case, the ward would ultimately submit to staff instructions, although the process \ncould take well over one hour to complete. Typically these events occurred during the Third Watch \nand tied up almost all of the security personnel at the institution during that time period. Once the \nward was placed in mechanical restraints, they were moved to a shower and permitted to wash off \nthe chemical agents. Other YA staff washed down the ward's room to remove chemicals from the \nenvironment. The ward was usually seen by a medical technician who washed out their eyes and \nexamined the ward for any injuries. In most cases the ward was then returned back to the original \nroom. This often appeared to me to be a great deal of investment of staff time and effort to slightly \npacify the ward who was originally being disruptive. None of the videos showed the YCOs utilizing \nthe advise or support of clinical staff or other non-security personnel. I was repeatedly told that once \nthe security staff were called, the yeas were supposed to back off. Ironically, the management of a \nvery angry and  upset ward is  passed over to  the  staff that probably knew  the  least  about  that \n\\ \ni  individual's psycho-social background. It was likewise unclear from the YA records, whether there \nI \nwas any subsequent mental health intervention for their wards by Y A staff. \n\\ \nThere is no doubt that Y A staff must aggressively intervene in situations in which ward \nI \nsafety is a major consideration. However, it is not clear that the secure area extractions are always \nwarranted, or if some lower level of force, including attempting a sustained conversation with the \nward, might not produce a better result with less risks to staff and wards. Although there are no \nnational  data on this  topic,  my strong  impression is  that  secure  area  extractions  conducted by \nsecurity staff alone is a very rare practice in juvenile corrections across the nation. It would be worth \nfinding out if CDC has the same rate of cell extractions as the Y A. \n37 \n\nIn my interviews with wards, especially those who were currently the SMP units, I was told \nthat wards created disturbances in their rooms (\"setting up shop\" or \"posting up\") as a method of \ngetting staff to respond to some concern or need that they had. For example, a ward told me that he \nneeded  a new toothbrush and made this  request of the YCO on duty.  Another ward was upset \nbecause his telephone time was shortened by a staff member. Others described having emotional \ncrises  after getting bad news  from  their families-e.g.,  expected visitors  would not be coming, \nfamily members were ill, or close friends had been killed. This acting out behavior and subsequent \nroom extractions was aimed at getting someone's attention and being taken seriously. This behavior \ndoes not necessarily reflect staff indifference to ward needs but may be a result of how many tasks \nmust be completed during a shift by Y A living unit staff. Further, many wards could benefit from \nhelp in communicating with others to achieve personal objectives. We know that many Y A wards \nhave serious difficulties with their interpersonal skills, especially with authority figures. Moreover, \nmany Y A staff acknowledged that the secure room extractions often involved wards with moderate \nor severe mental health issues, or those who were emotionally immature. Many of the wards told me \nthat they would never \"post up\" and that this was the behavior of other youths who \"have problems.\" \nEven more troubling, the secure area extractions are often perceived by staff and wards as \ncontests of will. The wards witnessing the large contingent of staff that are required to subdue one \nward are often cheering their peer and making disparaging comments about the staff. The entire \nliving unit is disrupted, the security resources of the whole institution are being spent on this one \nincident, and the atmosphere of \"staff against ward\" tensions is exacerbated. Interestingly, there are \nsignificant differences among Y A institutions in the frequency of secure area extractions.  While \nsome of these differences might be a simple function of the proportion of wards who are in single \nrooms, one suspects that distinct facility cultures effect how frequently the YCOs are called in to \nperform these tasks. The Y A needs to take a comprehensive look at the occurrence of secure area \n38 \n\\ \n\nextractions, including the policies and procedures that govern these events. Greater use of counseling \nresources or assistance from medical staff or chaplains might obviate the need for many of these \nsituations in which large amounts of force or chemical restraints are employed against wards. \nMonitoring the Use of Force \nSince Jerry Harper assumed the role of the Director of the Y A, he has taken several steps to \nbuild more review and accountability about the use of force. Some of these changes were instituted \nin response to  reports by the OIG, and other policy changes were based on Harper's experience \nmanaging the LA County Jail. The YA   seems to  take a very long time to  actually institute new \npolicies. Extensive consultation with CCPOA representatives is often cited by management staff as a \nmajor hurdle to finalizing new policies or revising older ones. Further, the traditional organizational \nstyle of the Y A was to delegate most of the details on implementation to the facility superintendents. \nThis practice was justified due to the different types of wards that each institution was managing, but \nthis highly decentralized model led to widely disparate practices. In the past, there was almost no \nCentral Office oversight or monitoring on how each facility was interpreting basic Y A policies. This \ntraditional  relationship  between  the  Central  Office  and  the  facilities  is  starting  to  change, \nengendering a substantial amount of complaining at the facility about unnecessary Central Office \npaperwork requirements  and  general meddling into  daily operational issues.  As  a result of this \nhistory,  the  Central Office has  tried to  solicit input and ideas  of facility-level  staff,  adopting  a \nconsensus-building model as  part of the development of new policies.  This consultative process \nmakes the creation of new policies a fairly lengthy process. As a result, Director Harper and his staff \nhave moved on a  number issues via the mechanism of Temporary Department Orders (TDO) to \naddress important concerns in a number of operational areas. \n39 \n\nUntil fairly recently most reviews of force were conducted at the institutional level without \nCentral Office review and oversight. In December, 2002, TDO 02-06 mandated that all inquiries as \nto the use of excessive force needed to be forwarded to the Central Office. About this same time, \neach facility was required to organize a use of force committee that was to meet monthly, forwarding \na summary of their data and their deliberations to the I&C Branch. Facility superintendents continue \nto exercise a fair amount of discretion as to the level and intensity of these inquires. However, all of \nthe superintendents that I talked with were keenly aware that the PLO lawsuit, audits by the OIG, \nand a more pro-active management style in the Central Office, were putting them in the spotlight, \nand these investigations consumed a very large portion of their work time and attention. \nIf an event at a facility requires a Serious Incident Report (SIR), a ward files a staff action \ngrievance about excessive force, or another staff members makes a report about excessive force, then \nthe superintendent will lead an inquiry into the matter. The superintendent will typically include his \nCOS and Assistant Superintendent in this matter. The involved staff, the Seniors (their supervisors), \nand the Treatment Team Supervisors may be called upon to assist in their inquiries. In the last year, \nthe Central Office required that all of these investigations must be reviewed and signed off by the \nDeputy Director of the I&C Branch.  Copies of these investigation reports also go to the Internal \nAffairs Division and are reviewed for the quality of the investigation and the completeness of the \nreport. The IA Unit determines if all the right questions have been answered, if further investigation \nis required, or if Internal Affairs needs to start its own investigation. According to the head of the \nYA   Internal Affairs Unit, Mark Gantt, \"In the past there was never a review by anyone outside the \ninstitution. We never saw them. The new process assures that there is an objective review and final \napproval.\" \nInformation provided to me by Stephen Stenoski reported that, in 2002,the I&C Branch had \nreceived 20 inquires that pertained to ward safety issues from El Paso De Robles, 12 each from HGS \n40 \n\nand Chad, 10 from Nelles, 7 from Preston, and 6 from Ventura. These were usually inquiries that \nfollowed  ward  grievances  about  their  lack  of safety.  Ten  of these  inquiries  were  referred  by \nStenoskl's Unit to  Internal Affairs.  Interestingly, 40% of the inquiries  from Nelles were sent to \nInternal Affairs. \nMark Gantt found 197 cases from Fiscal 2002 that were investigated by the Internal Affairs \nUnit.  Of these,  52  were  for  excessive  force  cases,  of which  16  were sustained.  There were  an \nadditional 4 investigations for excessive force involving chemical agents, of which 2 were sustained. \nThere were 8 IA investigations for \"discourteous treatment of wards,\" with 3 of these sustained. The \nbalance of the IA cases involved staff charged with domestic violence or failure to appear at work. \nThe IA Unit spends a average of 150-160 hours on these investigations, which are conducted by \ntrained criminal investigators. The report from IA goes back to the superintendent of the facility (or \nthe parole office supervisor). These latter staff decide if the charges have been: sustained and what if \nany sanctions are required. The Deputy Director of I&C must review these superintendent decisions \nand can agree or disagree. Assuming that an adverse staff action is recommended, there is a further \nexamination by the Adverse Action Review Committee that includes the Director of Y A, the Chief \nDeputy Director, the Deputy Director of the I&C Branch, the Chief Counsel, and the head of the \nInternal Affairs Unit. The legal department of Y A puts forward the presentation of the case to this \ncommittee. The final outcome of an adverse action against staff requires the approval of the first four \nmembers of this group. According to Mark Gantt, approximately 35% of these cases are sustained at \nthis level. There are also follow-up appeals that can be brought up to the State Personnel Board. \nThe Y A  takes these cases very seriously, but that they follow  a process which is  very \ndeliberate  and  cumbersome  and  takes  a  substantial  time  to  complete.  Given  the  very  frequent \nincidents involving the use force, especially chemical agents, it is obvious that current investigatory \nresources are  stretched very thin.  The small number of sustained adverse staff actions does  not \n41 \n\n---.. -.. --~~---\nappear to provide very much accountability, except in the most severe cases. The Y A must rely on \nthe  aggressive  pursuit  of its  policies  by the  institutional  superintendents  to  reduce  the  use  of \nexcessive force. These superintendents, in tum, must depend on their middle managers to convey the \nY A mission and culture, providing continuous reinforcement to line staff to do the right thing. \nSummary and Recommendations \nThe Y A suffers from a serious problem of violence in its institutions. This plays out in \nterms of large numbers  of assaults of wards  on wards,  as  well as  a significant number of ward \nassaults on staff. Of equal importance, the climate of violence has engendered high levels of fear \namong wards and staff that affect virtually all aspects of daily operations. These tensions produce an \nextensive use of force,  especially chemical agents.  Further, the Y A staff are mostly relying on a \nreactive response to the violence, involving the use of the DDMS and the resort to extensive use of \nrestrictive programs and temporary lockdowns. YA policies in these areas are relatively new and are \nstill being field-tested at the individual institutions.  Training resources  for line staff are limited, \nespecially in the areas in which TDOs and other interim rules are being enacted. The absence of new \ntraining  academies means  that most front  line staff are receiving limited training under the  7K \nprogram,  and  supervisors and  other middle managers  are not being trained  under these efforts. \nTraining  costs  come  out  of the  institutional  budgets,  requiring  the  superintendents  to  juggle \nexpenditures to  find budgetary resources  for  training.  While  greater Central Office oversight on \ncritical incidents and the use of force is a very positive step forward, the levels of resources being \ndevoted to this oversight by the Compliance Review Unit or through Internal Affairs are  not yet \nsufficient to fully implement the goals of the Central Office. \nStaff in the Central Office and at the various institutions claimed that levels of violence had \ngone down as the ward population was lowered. Living uriits hold fewer wards, especially when \n- 42 \n\ncompared with the chronic crowding of just a few years ago. The YA has generally responded to the \ndeclining ward population by closing housing units, or proposing to close whole facilities.  These \nplans are clearly driven by budgetary pressures, especially from the legislature. \nThere is some convincing evidence that lowering the size ofliving units and enriching staff \nresources  can reduce violence in the YA   and promote better rehabilitative outcomes. Impressive \n· research that was conducted by the Y A Research Division from the 1960s and 1970s showed that \n· lowering the  size  of living  units  to  no  more  than  50  wards  substantially improved correctional \nmanagement  and advanced treatment  goals.  This research has been influential for  the  design of \njuvenile correctional  facilities  across  the  nation,  and  was  important to  establishing  professional \nstandards (e.g., ACA standards) on the appropriate size of living units. Ironically, California policy \nmakers chose to ignore the findings of their own research and attempted to operate living units that \n· were too big. \nSaving money was the rationale for the larger units, but this justification may have fueled \nthe problems that now  plague the Y A.  Staff overtaxed by the number of wards that they must \nmanage have resorted to seemingly time-saving approaches that employ greater use of restraints and \nforce. Many staff complained that they lacked enough time to even talk to the wards on each shift, \nand were consequently not aware of the emotional state of the wards under their supervision. The \nstaff freely  admitted  that  daily  interactions  with  wards  was  very  important  to  creating  safer \nenvironments. The Y A needs to consider implementation of cost-effective methods to reduce the \nsize ofliving units and to increase the level ofp  ositive interactions among the YCCs and the wards. \nOne very promising step in this proposed direction that was initiated by Jerry Harper was \nthe  deployment  of the  Enhanced  Casework  Pilot Program.  This  program  was  implemented  in \nSeptember, 2002,  at  one living unit at  Chad,  Nelles,  O.H.  Close,  and El Paso  De Robles.  The \nProgram sought  to  reduce the  size of the Pilot Project living unit to below 60 wards.  The Pilot \n43 \n\n----------\nProgram also incorporated the YCOs into many of the daily operation posting assignments of the \nliving units, so that YCCs could be freed up to conduct more small and large group therapy sessions, \nprovide more hours of individual contact with wards, and so devote more time to developing and \nmonitoring individual case plans. \nThe early results of the Pilot Program have been quite encouraging. The wards are involved \nin 4 times as many hours of treatment than previously. The wards are more involved in small groups, \nand they are getting more hours of individual counseling. Of equal importance, there are many more \ntime credits for  good behavior being  awarded to  the  wards  in these  special units,  and they are \nreceiving fewer time adds  for  serious disciplinary infractions. Fewer wards in the Pilot Program \nunits are placed on TD. \nAlthough not all of the  Pilot Program sites have fully implemented the model,  due  to \nshifting staff or ward populations that have reduced the full effect of the program, the most stable \nand  consistent  Pilot Program  sites  have  witnessed  reductions  in  Level  B  infractions  and  other \ntroublesome ward behavior. These units have seen a reduction in serious incidents and in the need \nfor  the  use  of force  when  compared  with  the  situation  in  these  same  living  units  before  the \nimplementation of the Pilot Program. For example, at the Pajaro Unit at Chad, there has been a \nnoticeable reduction of wards transferred to the SMP or TD units. Further, Pajaro has witnessed a \ngrowing number of its inhabitants who are moved to less secure YA   institutions including the camps \nand pre-parole units. Whereas Chad had been traditionally viewed a \"the end of the line\" for Y A \nwards who would stay there until they reached their maximum confinement time, Pajaro is showing \nsignificant progress in moving wards to  settings that actually increase their chances of succeeding \nupon release. The Pajaro unit has been traditionally referred to by staff and wards as \"The Thunder \nDome,\" a place of extreme tension and violence. Now staff, both YCCs and YCOs, are requesting \nassignment to the unit. \n44 \n\nStaff in all the Pilot sites report that ward behavior has improved and that the milieu has \nimproved.  Levels of treatment services have  increased,  and they report  that the wards  seem to \nincorporate the treatment curriculum at a higher level. The YCCs have more time to complete their \ncasework responsibilities because there are freed,  by the presence of the YCOs, of some of their \nposting responsibilities. The staff report that they are getting to know the wards better, their files are \nbetter organized, and Y A supervisors suggest that case work preparation has improved. \nThe use of YCOs to  perform some of the living units duties was employed by the Y A \nadministration as a cost savings strategy for the Pilot Programs, rather than increasing the number of \nthe YCC staff. At present it appears that the Pilot Program is not substantially more expensive to \nimplement than the conventional model. \nThe YCOs who work in the living units are given the option of wearing their street clothes \nwhen they are working in the living units (similar to the YCCs), and most of the YCOs have opted \nfor this choice. Staff morale in the living units is reported to be higher than in previous times. Staff \nof the Pilot Programs feel that the program would be improved 'Yith even greater levels of staffing. \nThey express  concerns  about  the well-documented problems  of the  physical plants that  inhibit \neffective. casework and treatment services. The staff note that some wards do not embrace the more \nintense interactions with staff. To date, Y A has not tried to select those wards who would be best \nsuited for this program (another example of how an effective classification system would help the \nVA), but this makes the early results impressive because the selected living units have not be filled \nwith the wards that are the most easy to manage. \nThe early results of the Pilot Program, as well as past research conducted by the YA and \nother jurisdictions, suggests that the Pilot Program be expanded throughout the Y A. A special task \nforce should be immediately created to develop plans for an expansion of the Pilot Program concept. \nThis planning group would estimate the needed startup  costs and training requirements,  draft a \n45 \n\ndetailed program manual,  and resolve other operational issues such as potential union concerns. \nProjected savings in terms of reducing the lengths of stay in Y A facilities for those assigned to the \nEnhanced  Casework  program,  as  well  as  savings  due  to  reduced  need  for  DDMS  and  other \ninvestigatory functions, would appear to make this effort very marketable to the legislature and the \nGovernor's budget staff.  Further, the Pilot Program represents a proactive strategy that could de \nescalate the levels of violence experienced by both wards and staff. The expanded Pilot Program \nshould be evaluated by an independent research group that is very knowledgeable about juvenile \ncorrections. \nAlso important to reducing violence in the Y A is to upgrade and expand the training of \nstaff at all levels.  Current curriculum on the use of force  is  good, but is  not delivered with the \nfrequency and intensity that is required. The current curriculum is primarily aimed at getting greater \nstaff compliance with the newest Central Office Use of Force policies and monitoring requirements. \nThere  is  still  a  great  need  to  equip  staff,  especially those  assigned  to  the  living  units,  with \ninterpersonal skills to allow them anticipate violent situations and to prevent them. Staff are given \nremarkably little guidance in working with very emotionally troubled, and often mentally ill, wards. \nSome Y A institutions are experimenting with new models of dealing with aggressive and violence \nprone wards. For example, staff at the SMP unit at EI Paso De Robles have instituted the \"Limit and \nLead\" program as a guide to staff assigned to the SMP unit. There has been some training on \"Limit \nand Lead\" for middle managers at institutions. There presently does not exist more than anecdotal \nevidence that this new approach is effective. The Y A has encouraged a fair amount of staff creativity \nin  building  solutions  to  institutional  challenges.  I  heard  about  many new  ideas  that  might  be \nimplemented  at  different  sites.  While  this  practice  is  desirable,  it  also  means  that  there  is  a \ntremendous amount of flux in terms of suggested approaches, few with solid research support. It \n46 \n\nalmost appears that institutional practices are being molded by whatever consultants capture the \ninterest and limited budget resources of the local superintendents. \nThe Y A should  commit to  implementing a limited number of approaches to  managing \ndisruptive  wards  that  are  based  on  rigorous  research  and  testing.  These  strategies  need  to  be \nformalized in training materials, and integrated into the daily operations of each of the institutions. \nIdeally, approaches to preventing violent behavior by wards should involve teams of security staff, \ncounselors, and health and mental health clinical personnel. Other Y A staff including the teachers \nand the chaplains can be valuable resources in heading off violent confrontations in the institutions, \nproviding support and guidance to the front line staff. There are juvenile correctional agencies that \nhave  been very successful  in  enlisting the  support  and  assistance  of their  youthful  inmates  to \nincrease  the  safety  of facilities.  One  national  leader  in  this  \"Normative  Model\"  is  the  North \nAmerican Family Institute in Danvers, MA, which runs juvenile correctional programs in several \nstates. \nMonitoring of serious incidents must also improve. The current use of force committees are \nmeeting regularly, but the mandate and responsibilities of these groups are ambiguous. For example, \nit may be advisable  for  the Central Office to  set very tangible  goals  for the reduction of ward \nviolence  and the use  of force.  The  institutional committees  could be  charged with  developing \nspecific  plans  to  meet  these  goals.  They  would  become  responsible  for  achieving  sustained \nmeasurable declines in institutional violence, rather than conducting after-the-fact assessments of \ninstitutional statistics. The YA should explore ways of providing incentives to line staff, supervisors, \nand managers who can de-escalate the violence in their living units and facilities. \nThe Y A needs to substantially increase its budgetary commitment to ensuring compliance \nwith new policies on the use of force, and other key policies. The current investigatory process is too \n47 \n\nlimited and takes too long to complete to  be the primary tool that the Central Office employs to \nimplement its crucial policies. \nAt root, the Central Office needs to  infuse a \"new organizational culture\" that does not \naccept the current levels of ward violence or staff use of force.  A clear example of this need was \nrevealed during my site visit at EI Paso De Robles. Few Y A institutions have witnessed the same \nlevel of breakdown of basic rules of how wards should be lawfully treated as this facility. The abuses \nthat were uncovered by the OIG and the YA   Internal Affairs Unit were abhorrent. While current \nleadership at EI Paso De Robles has moved firmly to change practices, it was stunning to me to hear \nthe prior investigations referred to as \"The Witch Hunt.\" Many current middle managers felt that it \nwas the staff who were victims of over zealous investigators, not the wards who had been brutally \ntreated by some staff. An objective view of the older situation at EI Paso De Robles was that there \nwere \"real witches': and the culture that continues to view the investigators or \"whistle-blowers\" \nmust be changed. \nOrganizational culture change is aided by a new clarity of policy and procedure, but this \nmust be strongly reinforced by ongoing training, as well as daily reaffirmation of the values of the \nnew culture. It is admittedly very difficult for Central Office staff to effectively control the behavior \nof staff who work in institutions that are hundreds of miles from Sacramento. It is hard enough for \nsuperintendents to control the behavior of staff in their own institutions, especially in the evenings \nand hours of lower staffing. There is no substitute for continuous and regular communications of \norganizational  values  and expectations.  There  must also  be  opportunities  for  staff to  learn and \nparticipate in the new culture. \nMore frequent visits by Central Office staff to each of the facilities is a must. These visits \nshould last over  several days  and be focused  on monitoring compliance with important policies. \nThese sites visits should also provide institutional staff a chance to offer their suggestions on how \n48 \n\nbest to achieve organizational goals. Regular site visits should include confidential interviews with \nrandom samples of wards (similar to the interviews that I was able to conduct). Giving wards a clear \nway to raise issues of concern to them with Central Office staff sends a very important message to \nthe wards and the staff. The Compliance Review Unit staff making these visits ought to be selected \nfor  their  proven  track  records  to  be  completely  objective  and  professional.  Instituting  a  very \nintensive schedule of routine facility visits could be a crucial step to building and strengthening the \nhold of a new Y A organizational culture throughout the entire system. \nIII. RESTRICTIVE PROGRAMS \n•  Does the CYA have appropriate policies and procedure for restrictive housing? \n•  Does the CYA use appropriate criteria for placing wards in restricted programs? \n•  On a system-wide level are wards housed in a restrictive program for inappropriately long \nperiods oft ime (i.e., too many hours a day or too many days at a time? \n•  In its restricted programs, are the cages appropriate for exercise and learning, and if so, \ndoes the CYA use cages to provide exercise and education in an appropriate \nmatter? \n•  Are the CYA's restrictions on ward's access to visitors, newspapers, radio, television while \nin restricted programs appropriate? \n•  On a system-wide level, do wards in restrictive housing receive adequate food? \n•  On a system-wide level, do wards in restrictive housing receive adequate exercise? \n•  Do wards have appropriate opportunities to contest CYA's decisions to place them or \nretain them in restrictive housing? \n•  Are wards given adequate notice of why they are being disciplined or segregated? \n49 \n\n•  Has the CYA implemented ward grievance procedures that are appropriate or functional? \nAre they understandable and expeditious? \n•  Are the wards inappropriately placed in restrictive housing due to transfers between CYA   \ninstitutions? \n•  On a system-wide level, do CYA staffreceive adequate training regarding restrictive \nhousing procedures, and does the CYA appropriately monitor restrictive housing? \nIn  response  to  a  number  of concerns  expressed  by  wards,  their  families,  and  other \ncomplaints, the OIG conducted a series of reviews of Y A lockup programs in 2002, including the \nSMP programs and Temporary Detention Facilities. There were very specific reports of abuses at the \no \nand R living units at HGS that brought urgency to  this OIG investigation. This initial review, \nwhich covered lockup units at Chad, El Paso De· Robles, Preston and Nelles, found \"a system of \ndisciplinary detention fraught with identified and potential constitutional rights violations; and a \nmental health delivery system in complete disarray\" (OIG, Statewide Review of California  Youth \nAuthority Lockup Units,  June 28, 2000). The OIG review team concluded that many of the abuses \nstemmed from systemic problems and inadequate department policies and procedures. \nThese earlier review of lockup programs uncovered many examples of the use of chemical \nagents as punishment for wards that were physically restrained or otherwise under control. The OIG \nfurther  found  that  in  2000-2001  that the  YA  policies,  procedures,  and  training  failed  to  give \nsufficient consideration to the harmful effects of OC and CN chemicals. Ward injuries resulted from \nimproper use of chemicals, or failure to provide first aid treatment in a timely manner. The OIG also \nconcluded in this older review that the use of restraints at each of the investigated institutions were \nout of compliance with Central Office policies, and that these reports were poorly written and failed \nto adequately document the detailed staff actions involved in restraining the wards. Further, the OIG \n50 \n\nreported that YA management review of the use of force was inadequate and that the quality of \ninvestigations was poor. Also covered in earlier OIG reports were problems in the ward grievance \nsystem which minimized the value of this  system to  highlight ongoing problems.  In  2002  OIG \ninvestigators talked to  80 wards who  complained about informal punishments such as  failure to \nprovide hygiene items, room stripping,  and extensive periods of providing only sack lunches to \nwards in lockup. The wards in lockup complained of formal disciplinary actions against them that \ninvolved little regard for their rights to due process. The OIG also found that a significant number of \nmentally ill wards were held in the lockup units due to the lack of more appropriate treatment and \nhousing alternatives. \nThis OIG review involved a team of outside experts in the field of juvenile corrections in \naddition  to  OIG  staff.  These consultants  noted that Y A  practices  relative  to  lockup  units  were \ngenerally at odds with practices across the nation.  It was  also noted that federal  courts in cases \ninvolving the states of Arizona and Georgia had criticized practices that were ongoing in Y A, or that \nwere even more egregious than in those two states. \nAs a follow-up to  this initial OIG review, there was a subsequent investigation covering \nTemporary Detention programs at Chad, Preston, Nelles, El Paso De Robles, Stark, and the Southern \nReception Center that was completed in November of 2002. This review found that on any given \nday, between 10-12 percent of wards were housed in units in which they were confined to  their \nrooms  for 23  hours a day,  with one hour permitted outside their rooms under close supervision. \nDuring this one hour that they are out of their rooms, the wards may be in wrist and leg shackles, or \nthey are moved to small cage-like confinement areas known euphemistically as  Special Program \nAreas (SPAs). The wards in TD and the SMPs receive their educational services and counseling in \nthese cages. \n51 \n\nThe OIG reported that roughly 16 percent of all wards at the six facilities that were visited \nwere residing in an SMP unit and another three percent were in TD units. At HGS as many as 28 \npercent of the wards were in restricted housing units; 16 percent of wards at Nelles and ]4 percent of \nwards at Chad were in lockup units. It was very difficult to  determine from Y A data the precise \nreasons why wards were placed in these lockup units. There were no systematic data on how long \nwards were confined in these units. The OIG found that institutional ICCs exercised broad discretion \non  when  and  why some wards  would  be  placed in  the  23  and  1 programs.· There was  similar \nlocalized  discretion on when  and  how  they would be  released.  There  was  little  Central  Office \noversight into this process,  and no  clear data flowing into the Central Office on these restricted \nprograms. Towards the end of 2000, the YA Director was trying to pilot test a very rudimentary data \nsystem  for  detennining  how  the  lockup  programs  were  being  utilized.  There  was  optimism \nexpressed that the new Ward Information Network (WIN) would eventually provide a method of \nincreasing oversight over the  lockup  programs,  but the  WIN system's  full  implementation was \nexpected to take well into the future. \nSeveral of the 80 wards in lockup units that were interviewed by the OIG complained that \nthey were not receiving legally required services. Thirty-six of these wards said that they did not \nalways receive the one hour out of their rooms, especially on weekends or other times in which the \nstaff were  short handed. Almost 90 percent of the wards claimed that they did not get religious \ncounseling.  Some wards said that they never saw a Chaplain in the detention unit.  One-third of \ninterviewed wards alleged that they had not been allowed to make required phone calls; 40 percent \nsaid that they had not received regular visits from their treatment team after being placed in TD. At \nthe time of this OIG review, the YA record keeping on the mandated services to wards in SMPs and \nTD units was insufficient to either refute or validate the claims by the wards. \n52 \n\nThe OIG review also found that many of the restricted housing units were in disrepair, with \nwalls filled with graffiti, poor lighting, and inadequate temperature controls. Wards in these units \nwere only allowed to be dressed in underwear and socks. Some wards, attempting to increase the \ntemperature in their cells, had plugged up air vents, causing many of the rooms to possess extremely \nnoxious  odors.  A  third  of the  rooms  had  dirty  floors  and  walls,  with  a  variety of unsanitary \nsubstances covering air vents. OIG staff found that 54 percent of wards were missing basic hygiene \nitems such as toothpaste and soap; 40 percent lacked writing materials; and 26 percent of the rooms \nhad inadequate lighting. \nThese alarming findings by the OIG have led to  major restructuring of Y A policies and \nprocedures about restricted housing programs. Top YA leadership has placed a major emphasis on \ngreater Central Office control over who enters these units and how long they are confined. Data on \nthe wards in lockup are somewhat better: Serious attempts are being made to shorten lengths of stay \nin restricted housing units. There are increased efforts to train institutional staff on the importance of \nensuring that the wards in SMPs and TD receive the legally mandated services and care to which \nthey are  entitled.  The  Y A  Director has  been  very clear in  his  communications  that restrictive \nprograms are not intended as punishment. In Jerry Harper's view \"the courts send wards to  the \nYouth Authority as punishment notjor punishment.\" Harper also began the process of removing all \nwards with mental health issues out of the lockup units, and is attempting to close down the lockup \nunits that are in the worst physical condition. All these efforts have met with opposition from some \nCCPOA members who accuse the Director of coddling offenders and somehow endangering their \nmembership. In the next section, I will review my own impressions on how much these attempted \nreforms have achieved. \n53 \n\nThe Current Status of YA Restricted Programs \nAs part of the current review, I toured the TD and SMP units at each of the facilities that I \nvisited. Several of the wards with whom I conducted confidential interviews were current residents \noflockup units. I also asked wards from other living units ifthey had spent time in TD or in an SMP \nand asked them questions about that experience. \nY A has assigned Mark Blaser to head up reviews of the restricted programs. He compiles \nongoing data on these programs, and visits all of them on a regular basis. The Y A has instituted a \nnew policy in which all wards assigned to  restricted living units must be considered for transfer \nwithin 60 days of their assignment of units. A team consisting of Central Office staff and a multi \ndisciplinary team from the facility reviews each ward and either approves a three-day extension of \nthe time in lockup, or develops a plan to move the youth to another program setting. \nData for a four-week period in August and September of 2003 showed that the number of \nyouths in restricted programs throughout the YA   ranged from a low of 427 to a high of 468. The \naverage daily popUlation of restricted programs was 445. This represented approximately 10 percent \nof all wards confined in the YA. For this  four-week period, there was an average of 155  youths \nhoused in TD units and 244 in SMPs; another 46 wards were housed in other restricted programs. \nAccording to the Y A data, more than 10 percent of the wards in restricted programs were designated \nas mental health cases, and 8 percent were identified as special education cases. \nThe vast majority of wards living in restricted programs were at Chad and HGS. As of \nSeptember 5, 2003, there were 100 wards in lockup units at Chad and 143 at HGS. On the same day, \nthere were 81 wards in restricted programs at Preston, 66 at El Paso De Robles, 47 at Nelles, and 7 at \nVentura. \nOther YA   information suggests that the average number of days in TD was 4 during the \nfirst six months of 2003, with the longest detention stays at Chad and HGS. These average lengths of \n54 \n\nstay  (ALaS)  do  not  include  those  wards  that  are  on  court holds,  awaiting  potential  criminal \nprosecutions. These wards spend substantial amounts of time in this court hold status, with some \nremaining in lockup for nearly one year. \nWards on court holds are typically held in the SMPs and were 54 percent of all wards in \nSMPs who were reviewed by the YA Restricted Program Committee from April, 2002-June, 2003 . \n. The average length of stay in lockup for these court holds at the time of their reviews was 114 days . \n. Court holds in HGS had been locked up for an average of 86 days compared to 135 days for Chad. \nPreston court holds had been in 23-hour-a-day lockup for an average of 110 days; similar wards \nfrom Nelles had been confined for an average of 121  days and Paso wards for an average of 118 \ndays.  Court hold wards  who  spend very long times in SMPs  must pose a serious management \nproblem for staff that are trying to operate a much shorter term restricted program. \nAs for the overall SMP popUlation, the average length of stay in these living units ranged \nfrom a high of 70 days at HGS to a low of 52 days at Chad, based on data from the first quarter of \n2003. During this same period, average lengths of stay in SMPs were 54 days at Nelles, 67 days at EI \nPaso De Robles, and 59  days  at Preston.  There is  some fluctuation in these average stays from \nquarter to quarter. For example, the average SMP stay at HGS went up from 50 days to 70 between \nthe third quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003, whereas the ALaS in SMPs went from 54 \ndays to 52 days at Chad in this period. Preston, EI Paso De Robles, and Nelles witnessed slight \nincreases in the ALaS in their SMP units. \nIn the aftermath of the  OIG reports,  the Y A developed a very detailed set of policies \ngoverning the operation of restricted housing programs. There is far more Central Office oversight \non lockup programs than in the recent past. YA manager Mark Blaser has worked very intensively \nwith institutional staff to develop more uniformity in admissions criteria for TD and SMPs, and to \nreduce lengths of stay. The regularly scheduled visits of Blaser and other Central Office staff to each \n55 \n\nfacility to conduct reviews of the status of every ward in a restricted housing program has introduced \nan important set of \"checks and balances\" into this process. \nThe data available to  Y A on the restricted housing programs is still less than ideal. For \nexample, there are weekly snapshots of this popUlation, but no efficient way to determine how many \nwards go through these programs in a given year, or how many wards are mUltiple admissions to \nthese programs. Further, it is not easy to calculate the actual time that wards spend in lockup if they \nare first sent to TD and then placed in SMPs. Y A can track current cases that are in lockup on court \nholds, but lacks accurate data on how long these youths stay in restricted programs until their court \ncases are finally resolved. Still it is clear that lengths of stay in TD and the SMPs have declined. At \nthe  time  of the  OIG  investigation,  the  expected  stay  in  SMPs  was  over  nine  months.  This \nextraordinarily long time in 23-hour-a-day lockup began to drop as the Y A Central Office starting \nmonitoring these cases more closely. Today, wards are generally housed in SMPs for 60 to 90 days. \nAfter 60 days, the institution must justify holding the ward for additional time. This added time in \ni \nI  the SMPs must be subsequently reviewed every 30 days by teams that include institutional parole \nI \nofficers, treatment team supervisors, education staff, mental health personnel, and gang coordinators. \n! \nThe deliberations of this group are monitored and approved by Blaser and other assigned Central \n1 \nI \nOffice staff. The SMPs are now viewed as short-term interventions requiring the team to formulate \nstrategies to return the ward to more suitable housing units. \nY A staff are also more focused on assessing the potential for suicide and other mental \nhealth issues of wards placed in TD and SMPs. The Y A has developed increased awareness that \nlockup units are unacceptable places to  house wards with. mental health problems. Director Jerry \nHarper has already ordered that all wards with mental health designations should be removed from \nthe Tamarack SMP at Preston. The review teams led by Mark Blaser have moved aggressively to \nfacilitate the timely transfer of wards with mental health issues out of lockup and into ITPs and \n56 \n\nSCPs. At Preston, the Y A has opened a special program designed to  manage mentally ill wards \nwhose  behavior  is  violent  or  extremely  confrontational.  The  Y A  Central  Office  has  clearly \ncommunicated its policy that lockups are not designed for mentally ill wards. \nI attended several reviews of the current status of the residents of restricted programs. \nThese reviews were quite comprehensive and allowed many Y A staff to provide their suggestions. \nThe process seemed to work best for youths who were identified as mental health cases. In these \ninstances  the mental health staff seemed to  work effectively with the Central  Office  and  other \ninstitutional staff to plan for transitions out oflockup into ITPs or SCPs. This was more of a problem \nfor facilities that lacked sufficient onsite mental health programs. \nMore difficult were the cases in which the ward's assaultive behavior seemed unlikely to \nchange.  Wards  who  had already hit their maximum confinement time  and who  were  set to  be \nreleased posed the most serious challenges for the review committee. Another issue was the reduced \nnumber  of general  popUlation  living  units.  As  the  Y A  has  witnessed  a  greatly reduced  ward \npopUlation, the response has been to close down living units and to consolidate the remaining wards \nin fewer housing units. Although this might make sense from a budgetary standpoint, it means that \ninstitutions must balance the problems of violence and gang conflicts in fewer places. For example, \nif a ward in an SMP was regularly involved in fights with rivals in their previous dormitory, sending \nthat ward back to the same living unit might simply create a replay of the original confrontations. \nFurther, grudges and perceived insults that evolved during ward stays in lockup could easily spill \nover to the regular living units. \nThe restricted program review committee struggled with these problems on an ad hoc basis. \nOne sensed that the group felt that there were few real options and that the original behavior that got \nthe ward into  lockup might well continue. The major criteria that  seemed to  govern the review \ndecisions  (except in those cases  in which mental health issues were clearly involved) were the \n57 \n\ndegree to which the wards followed staff instructions and did not receive additional DDMS charges \nwhile in the restricted program. There was little discussion about whether the ward's participation in \nthe SMP program had accomplished a reduction in the underlying problem behavior. Y A staff often \ntold me that the really dangerous gang youths were very adept at \"staying low profile\" while in \nlockup so that they could quickly return to regular housing units to pursue their gang activities or to \nretaliate with other wards. It was as likely that the emotionally troubled wards or the more immature' \nones would continue to defy staff instructions, provoking secure area extractions, and piling up more' \ndisciplinary problems. Some staff suggested that some wards were using the lockup units as self \nprotection from other wards,  and they would violate rules  and \"act-out\" to  try to  remain in the \nrestricted programs, or to convince Y A staff to transfer them to other units. \nDespite vastly improved Y A processes to regulate how youths enter restricted programs, \nand to expedite their return to more appropriate housing units, the restricted programs are still very' \nproblematic. First and foremost, the lengths of stay in the SMPs are still much longer than those \nencountered in  virtually any other juvenile correctional system in  the  nation.  For most juvenile \ncorrectional systems, restricted programs rarely last more than a week. While 60-90 day programs \nare better than the 270-360 day stays in the past, the duration of lockup programs in YA poses a \nserious problem. Y A has worked to reduce stays in the TD units, however, wards facing criminal \nprosecutions routinely spend many months in lockup units. \nIt is hard to  imagine that 23-hour confinement over several months has any therapeutic \nvalue. Most psychologists and mental health professionals would argue that this severe isolation is \nantithetical  to  sound  treatment  practices.  Since  the  invention  of solitary  confinement  by the \nPhiladelphia Quakers in the 18th century, we have learned that this approach produces hostility and \nillness,  not  health.  The  enforced  isolation  of troubled  wards  and  minimal  meaningful  social \ninteractions with YA staff can only plausibly lead to their psychological deterioration. The YA has \n58 \n\nno data suggesting that the use of SMPs produces more than a very short-term response to various \nforms of prohibited behavior by wards. The ongoing levels of violence in the Y A suggest that SMPs \nare not effective to reduce this problem. \nIt is worth noting that the physical conditions of many of the SMPs and other lockup units \nremains deplorable. The programs that are housed in the \"270\" living units are a bit cleaner, but still \nlack needed program or counseling space.  One positive sign was  the closure of an SMP unit at \nNelles that was filthy, vermin-infected, and subject to flooding in the rainy season. When I visited \nthis unit, it was filled with litter and trash on the floors. Staff and management seemed unable or \nunwilling to maintain even basic conditions of sanitation. In response to the closing of this unit, \nCCPOA objected and some of its members alleged that action was coddling the wards.  Another \nSMP unit at Preston has been repeatedly labeled as a \"dungeon\" by Y A Director Jerry Harper. Other \nunits are poorly lighted and have terrible ventilation. The tells are not well designed to  monitor \npotentially suicidal wards, and the video equipment in the rooms is in disrepair. YA staff have often \nmade room conditions worse by blocking off doors or openings in their attempts to stop gassings. It \nis worth noting that gassings of staff primarily occur in the lockup units. It is difficult as one tours \nthe lockup units to reach any other conclusion than that these conditions of confinement are designed \nto punish their inhabitants. \nI did not find deliberate efforts on the part of staff to deny access of wards in the restricted \nprograms to  religious services, visiting, or phone contacts. However, the operation of these units \nmakes normal forms of contact with other staff and family members quite difficult. For example, \nChaplains or treatment staff are often required to communicate with wards through the doors to their \ncells. Time outside of the cells almost always involved full mechanical restraints or time in the \ncages. Wards told me that they spent most of their day in lockup units sleeping or reading. They \nwould often sleep through most of the daytime hours and be up  all  night.  The noise levels and \n59 \n\n---\n--------------\nchaotic environment of the lockup units  led to conditions of insomnia and other forms  of sleep \ndeprivation. Some of the wards told me that they began hearing voices and experiencing symptoms \nof other mental health problems. Most wards reported symptoms of severe depression,  including \nsuicidal  ideation.  The  staff felt  that  some  wards  feigned  suicidal  potential  as  a way of getting \ntransferred out of restricted programs to the mental health programs. \nIt also appears that YA   is paying more attention to seeing that wards in restricted programs \nreceive mandated services. The responsibility for monitoring the mandated services still is handled \nby the facility administrators. The WIN system does include entries that allow for Central Office \nstaff to see if mandated services are provided. However, in my own attempts to sample these data, I \nfound that the WIN system did not offer a foolproof way of measuring compliance. For example, \ndata entry delays at one facility made it appear that wards had not received meals for several days. \nTypically this information is available from written logs kept in the individual units. The Central \nOffice needs to establish other methods to reliably audit the delivery of services in the restricted \nunits in addition to the WIN system. \nA major challenge for the restricted programs is the apparent lack of a clear and coherent \ntreatment program that would transition wards back to  regular housing units.  It was difficult to \ndetermine if wards in these units received any additional treatment services compared to wards in \ngeneral  population  units.  Treatment  in  the  Y A  often  amounts  to  giving  the  wards  \"canned\" \nworkbooks that cover topics such anger management, gang avoidance, or substance abuse. Wards in \n23-hour-a-day lockup often used these workbooks to pass the time, but it is unclear how much real \ninteraction that they get from the counseling or treatment staff. Further, it is difficult to determine if \nthere  are  specialized  and individual  treatment plans that  are  implemented  for  youths  in  lockup \nprograms. As noted above, at least one SMP unit at EI Paso De Robles has instituted a particular \nward education and management curriculum, but other restricted units appear to lack well-defined \n60 \n\ntreatment objectives. Although behavior modification approaches were once very popular in the Y A, \nthese approaches seem to be mostly operationalized in terms ofthe Phase System. The Phase System \nis differentially applied at each institution, and mostly involve the giving or taking of daily privileges \nbased on whether the wards get sustained DDMS charges. The Phase System does not seem to focus \non  promoting  the  positive  interpersonal  skills  and  abilities  that  could  help  wards  avoid  future \nbehavioral  problems.  Further,  many  of the  wards  in  restricted  units  have  ongoing  DDMS \ninvestigations that may well result in time adds. This means that successful stays in lockup may still \nresult in subsequent punishments that are above and beyond the time spent in lockup. The wards that \nI interviewed often complained that time in restricted programs was  \"dead time\" during which \neducational advancements or completion of YOPB ordered treatment plans was very difficult. Thus, \na stay in lockup frequently meant a longer stay in Y A. \nCourt Cases \nThe Y A has worked to reduce the amount of time that wards spend in TD and to quickly \nreturn  them to  regular living  units.  This process  often involves expedited investigations  of the \nincidents leading to placement in a TD unit, or the timely development of alternative treatment plans \nand living unit assignments for these wards. One big exception to this process has been for wards \nfacing potential criminal prosecutions. The CCPOA has lobbied the Y A administration to increase \nthe  number  of cases  of institutional  misconduct  that  are  handled  through  referral  for  further \nprosecution rather than via the DDMS system. \nI found that there is a great deal of variation in how aggressively individual superintendents \npursue these criminal prosecutions. It seems to matter whether local prosecutors are interested in \npushing these cases in local criminal courts. Further, some YA staff complained that cases that were \n61 \n\nsent back to juvenile courts rarely received additional time from judges. On the other hand, adult \ncourt prosecutions could result in prison sentences. Some institutions really push these prosecutions. \nFor instance, Preston and EI Paso De Robles are more focused on these prosecutions than is Nelles. \nAt EI Paso De Robles, they have funded through the institution's annual operating budget, a mini-\npolice department with impressive crime lab capacities that can investigate and bring these cases \nforward. The head of this unit, who is also responsible for managing the ward's rights, is very proud \nof his  relationships  with  local  prosecutors  that  produce  a nearly perfect  conviction rate.  Other \nsuperintendents devote less of their budgets to this activity.  Thus, it appears that the same ward \nmisconduct could result in  a criminal prosecution  at  one  facility,  whereas  it  might be handled \nthrough the DDMS system at another. Criminal prosecutions are more common at HGS and Chad, \nbecause the wards at these facilities are almost always over 18. Further, wards at HGS and Chad \nhave often received many time adds while at  other facilities  and have  already been given their \nmaximum confinement time.  Thus,  staff at  these two  deep-end YA    facilities  feel  as  though the \nDDMS system provides no practical deterrent effect for the wards. \n\\  Wards awaiting court trials are subject to very long stays in TD units. All the problems of \nI \nlengthy stays in lockup are multiplied for these wards. First, one wonders if there is any evidence \nI  that the pursuit of criminal prosecutions is, in fact, an effective behavioral  management tool for the \nY A. Some wards who receive prison terms actually return to HGS or Chad if they have remaining \ntime left on their YA commitments. YA superintendents and other staff have expressed concerns that \nwards returning CDC institutions can create even larger problems for the youth institutions to which \nthey return. Some believe that these wards worsen the gang problems at HGS and Chad. Wards that \nare  sent to  CDC have the option to  request that they serve their remaining Y A terms  in CDC \nfacilities. Second, the variability in institutional practices to pursue criminal prosecution raises issues \nof equal protection of law. To my knowledge, there is no Central Office review or oversight of these \n62 \n\ndecisions to pursue criminal prosecutions. It is unclear why some of these wards could be screened \nfor their further potential for violence and returned to regular housing units, or mental health units as \nappropriate, while awaiting the resolution of their criminal charges. Finally, there is the question of \nwhere these wards facing prosecutions should be housed in Y A SMP units as opposed to the local \ncounty jails.  In  some  instances,  the  conditions  of confinement  in  local jails  would  not  be  as \nrestrictive as in YA SMP units. At best, this policy should receive a top-level management review. \nThe Cages \nWards in restricted programs usually receive their educational, counseling, and recreational \nservices in cages that are referred to as Secure Program Areas (SPAs). A number of outsiders have \nraised grave concerns about the SPAs, including the Board of Corrections that requested that the Y A \nconduct a thorough review of the cages. In 2002, the Y A formed a task force to look at the practice \nof utilizing the cages. Besides Y A staff, Sue Burrell of the Youth Law Center was invited to attend \nthese meetings. \nThe task force  found that the cages were introduced in 1998 as  a method of providing \nlegally mandated  educational  services  to  wards  in  restricted programs  (Secure  Program  Areas: \nReport of Committee,  May  15,  2002).  Before the  cages,  these  wards  received  their educational \nmaterials  and  communicated  with  teachers  through  a  food  slot  in  their  room  doors.  Y A  has \napproximately 70 cages that are operated in 4 facilities (Chad, HGS, Nelles, and Preston). There are \nseven other Y A facilities with no cages. The Y A task force found that only a small percentage of the \nwards who were in TD or SMP units that used the cages were there due to assaults on staff (8.5 \npercent in SMPs and 6.8 percent in Temporary Detention units. For one-third of the wards in these \nunits, the reason for being in SMP or TD did not involve assaults on staff or other wards Other \nprofile data suggested that these wards were similar in their criminal histories to other Y A wards and \n63 \n\nthat they were somewhat younger than other Y A residents. Youths who were managed in the cages \nwere  disproportionately African American,  Asian  or Latino  compared to  the  general  Y A  male \npopulation. \nStaff that were surveyed expressed the need to  use the cages for at least some of these \nwards. They pointed out that the residents of the restricted programs had been removed from other \ngeneral population units and did pose a danger to others. The staff liked the cages because it made \nthem feel safer. However, other staff recognized that the use of the cages could be dehumanizing, \nand the cages did afford the wards the opportunity to interact peacefully with others.  These staff feel \nthat  the  SPAs  made the  institutions  less  safe  because they did  not  allow  for  resolution  of the \nunderlying conflicts that would flair up again as the wards were released. Concern was expressed by \nstaff that the cages actually cut down on the healthy communication that should be taking place \namong staff and wards. \nThe Y A  task force found that no  other states were using the cages.  The Y A basically \ndesigned their own prototypes, since these units were not being manufactured for the corrections \nmarket. Some other states provided education for youths in lockup by increasing staff supervision, \nothers did not offer education for youths in lockup units despite clear legal requirements. The Youth \nLaw Center has suggested that the cages pose several important constitutional problems, and that \nproviding educational services in the cages did not meet federal or state statutory requirements. For \nexample, wards in the cages received far fewer hours of schooling or special education services than \nare mandated by law. \nThere was general agreement that not all wards who experienced the cages needed this \nlevel of security_ There was a sense among the YA working group that the use of the cages should be \nreduced. A minority of the committee called for their complete elimination.  In any event, it was \nagreed that the  Y A  lacked an  effective screening mechanism to  decide which wards  should be \n\\  64 \n, \n\nmanaged in the cages. Further, it was agreed that wards should be moved out of the cages after a \nbrief period of time.  The cages needed to  be part of a continuum of responses to  the potential \ndangers posed by youths in the lockup units. The SPA committee recommended that more specific \npolicies and procedures be developed about the use of the cages. It was acknowledged that the cages \nwere symptomatic of larger issues confronting the YA  . I have already alluded to  some of these \nissues such as of the prevalence of institutional violence, the control of gang behavior, the lack of \neffective classification, and limited training of staff in offender management strategies. \nWhen I conducted my site visits, some ofthe institutions were already attempting to reduce \ntheir reliance on cages. At HGS the superintendent was encouraging staff to reduce the use of the \ncages after 30 days; at Preston, some wards were receiving educational services in classrooms or in \nteachers' offices. Institutions are attempting to allow some joint programming among wards in the \nlockup units. \nTo the visitor, the cages seem to be in stark opposition to the mission and philosophy of the \nY A. Without minimizing the amount of violence that plagues the Y A, it is difficult to see how the \ncages provide more than the illusion of safety. As one of the Chaplains explained to me about the \nuse of the cages: \"The Y A has a serious problem with gangs, but their solution is demonic.\" It also \nseems clear that the Y A could upgrade staff and ward safety through other less degrading methods. \nSummary and Recommendations \nWhile the courts have recognized the need for juvenile corrections agencies to operate very \nshort-term lock up programs, none of these cases has approved 23-hour-a-day lockups for as long as \nthey are used by the Y A. There is a general professional consensus that solitary confinement is not a \ndesirable correctional strategy for either adults or juveniles, except under emergency situations. I \n65 \n\nknow of no  other juvenile correctional systems that operate SMP programs that are in any way \nsimilar to  those of the  Y A.  Programs  for  very violent juvenile offenders  are often  designed to \nprovide enriched counseling and treatmcnt resources. Youths in these other locales are not lockcd in \ntheir rooms  for  all  but one  hour per day.  No  one  else  uses  cages  for  education  and  treatment \npurposes. \nOther sections of this report have suggested a number of methods by which the Y A could \nattempt to stem the violence in its facilities. I have indicated that I consider that this climate of fear \nand violence is very real and very ,disturbing. However, there is no credible evidence that the SMPs \nprograms, as presently operated, contribute very much to a de-escalation of these problems. Indeed, \nthere is reason to believe that the extensive use of lockup makes the violence worse. \nY A  has  made  significant  strides  in  better  Central  Office  oversight  of the  restricted \nprograms. There is  greater accountability in terms of who is  placed in these programs and when \nyouths can be returned to other housing units. Progress has been achieved, but many of the concerns \nexpressed by the OIG are still present. \nI would urge the Y A to  continue to  phase out the SMP program as  currently operated. \nMany of these decrepit living units need to be closed immediately. Y A should convene a task force, \nincluding top juvenile corrections professionals from other states, to redesign programs for violent \nwards. It is entirely possible that YA   could institute programs for their most dangerous wards that \nare more consistent with the best research in \"what works\" and with its own mission of providing \ntreatment and education. This new program model must be rooted in the fact that all of these wards \nwill be released to the community in a relatively short period of time, and that effective institutional \nprograms must be integrated with preparation for returning home. \n66 \n\nPart of this review of restricted programs should be an examination of ways to  further \nreduce ALOS in the TD units, and to reexamine the current policies and practices relating to wards \nbeing prosecuted for alleged offenses while they are in the Y A. \nThe cages should be eliminated as quickly as possible. They are degrading and antithetical \nto the mission and goals of the YA  . Staff need to be convinced that other more humane approaches \ncan be equally safe, and more effective, in stemming future assaults on wards and staff. A key area \nfor  examination is  the  value of much smaller living  units,  with  greatly enriched  treatment and \nsecurity staffing patterns. Staff training, especially in the management of disruptive wards, must be \nexpanded and intensified. Y A staff at all levels should be enlisted in efforts to reform and replace the \ncurrent lockup programs. \nThe YA  's progress in limiting the use ofthe restricted programs can also be used to \ndemonstrate that further moves in this direction are possible and beneficial YA   leadership needs to \ncontinue its strong message that the courts \"send youths to YA as punishment, not/or punishment.\" \nIf this statement is true, then current SMP programs should be ended and replaced by more suitable \ncorrectional interventions as soon as this is practical. \nIV. ACCESS TO COURTS AND WARDS RIGHTS \n•  Are the CYA's policies and practices appropriate to protect confidential communications \nbetween wards and their attorneys? \n•  Are the CYA 's policies and practices appropriate to protect the wards' ability to file \ngrievances without fear of retaliation? \n•  On a system-wide level, are wards threatened or harassed for communicating with their \nattorneys? \n67 \n\n•  Is the ward grievance procedure fair, simple, and accurate? \nMy review of the YA   policies and practices relative to  ward communications with their \nattorneys  did  not  reveal  any systemic  problems.  The nearly  100 wards  that I  interviewed  on  a \nconfidential basis did not complain about being denied access to attorneys or to  legal libraries at \ntheir institutions. This question was asked of virtually every wara with whom I spoke.  Only one \nyouth complained that he was denied access to  the law library, and he  did write a letter to  the \nOmbudsperson about this issue. I have requested that the Y A Office of Legal Counsel look into this \ncomplaint and report back to  me on the circumstances of this incident and the resolution of the \ndispute ..  The Y A reponse suggested that the ward's concerns about access to  legal materials did \nseem valid. This particular ward was  housed in an SMP unit. . Staff were instructed by the Central \nOffice to assist the ward in locating the materials that were requested. The ward has since received \nthe requested law books in his room. \nThe wards rarely,  if ever,  file grievances about being denied access to  lawyers or legal \nreading  materials.  My review  of six  months  of letters  written to  Director Harper  included  no \ncommunications on this topic. I found no evidence that wards are threatened by staff if they request \naccess to lawyers. It appears that attorneys from the Youth Law Center had open access to wards as \npart of their monitoring of the Nick 0 consent degree. \nAttorney visits to wards are relatively rare. For example, Ventura logged in 20 such visits \nover a 12-month period. For other institutions, the number of visits was smaller. Institutions replied \nback to  the  Y A  Legal  Counsel  that  they had not denied  access  of any ward to  their lawyers. \nDepartmental policies are clear on the right of wards to have legitimate access to their lawyers in \nappropriate settings. In most cases, these meetings occur in rooms designed for YOPB hearings, \ncounseling offices, or some rooms that  are  specifically set  aside for  these visits.  All wards  are \n68 \n\nescorted  to  these  meetings  by YCOs  who  remam  outside  of closed  meeting  rooms.  Wards  in \nrestricted housing units are escorted in mechanical restraints. I did not observe any of these attorney \nmeetings, but the YCOs always permitted me to interview all wards behind closed doors. \nMy discussions with wards suggested that many of them could think of few reasons why \nthey needed to talk to lawyers, except in instances in which they were appealing their original YA   \ncommitments. Wards do not have the right to have legal counsel present at their board hearings, or \nduring most DDMS proceedings, and these are the circumstances in which they are most likely to \nwant to  consult with attorneys.  Typically,  requests  for  access  to  attorneys  are  initiated with the \nYCCs, but are often arranged by the institutional parole agents. Most wards are unaware of other \nreasons,  for  example  civil  and  family  court  matters,  that  might  lead  them  to  seek  legal \nrepresentation. Many wards told me that they had no idea that the Y A had legal libraries that were \navailable to them. Nor were they aware of the steps they needed to take to request access to these \nfacilities.  As will be discussed later, the Y A faces more serious needs in the provision of wards' \nrights  through  the  Ward  Grievance  System  (WGS).  It is  suggested  that,  as  YA  improves  its \neducational process on the rights of wards, issues of access to attorneys and to legal materials should \nbe part of these informational efforts. \nOne area in which the access to legal representation by wards should be further explored is \nin the instance of court cases. Wards charged with new felony charges while they are incarcerated \nare entitled to full constitutional guarantees of legal protection. The Y A wards must depend on the \nenergetic commitment of the local public defender's office to provide legal advice and to protect \ntheir legal rights. The Y A staff are focused on informing wards of their Miranda rights, but it is the \nlocal district attorney and public defender who decide how vigorously to  purse these cases.  It is \nworth examining in the future if the quality and timeliness of legal representation of YA   wards in \npotential criminal investigation meets the same standards as in the community at large. \n69 \n\nTraditionally young people in juvenile correctional facilities do not avail themselves of the \naccess to legal libraries and attorneys that one sees among adult prisoners and jail inmates. The Y A \nhas developed an elaborate dispute resolution process via the WGS to attempt to cure reasonable \ncomplaints by wards. There are far fewer \"jailhouse lawyers\" in the Y A.  The very limited amount \nof prior legal complaints on conditions of confinement and civil rights violations by YA   wards, \ncompared to  the extensive history of similar issues raised in CDC, may argue for increasing the \naccess of wards to appropriate legal consultation. Prior lawsuits against the CDC have ushered in a \nrange of policy changes and procedural reforms that have improved the overall operation of that \nsystem. While litigation should never be the first recourse to bring about needed reforms, conditions \nin the YA might improve at a quicker pace if the potential for judicial scrutiny were more realistic. \nThe Ward Grievance System \nIn the 1970s,  under the  leadership of Allen Breed, the Y A implemented an innovative \nsystem of giving wards a method to bring forward their concerns in a safe and effective manner. The \nWard Grievance System (WGS) was  intended as  an application of alternative dispute resolution \ntechniques such as mediation and arbitration to resolve institutional problems. Every Y A institution \nhas a ward's rights coordinator who is responsible for logging in the grievances and tracking their \nresolution. The system is operated by Y A wards who are trained by the wards rights coordinator. \nEvery living unit, including the restricted housing units, has a WGS clerk and access to the system. \nOnce grievances are logged, there is the assumption that these will be resolved at the level of the \nliving unit. If this fails,  the dispute will be reviewed by the top facility management. In about a \ndozen cases a year, the Y A brings in an outside arbitrator who is under contract to be the final voice \nin resolving problems. \n70 \n\nOver the course of a year, the Y A processes several thousand of these ward grievances. \nFrom July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2003, there were 7,356 grievances at the nine major YA institutions. \nThere were 2,119 filed at Chad and 1,413 filed at HGS, the institutions with the older wards who \ngenerally have had the longer correctional stays in Y A.  Interestingly, there were 1,695 grievances \nlogged at Ventura that has a smaller ward popUlation than at these other facilities. According to Y A \nstaff, most of the ward complaints at Ventura came from the young women housed there. During this \nsame time frame there were 482 grievances at Preston, 344 at EI Paso De Robles, and 385 at Nelles. \nThe vast majority of these complaints were for a broad range of personal issues raised by the wards; \nthe next most frequent category involved \"disrespect.\" \nGrievances  are  categorized  into  three  groups.  Emergency  gnevances  that  need  to  be \nresolved with  that work shift  or the  problem becomes moot,  such as  failure  to  provide meals. \nRegular grievances can take a bit longer to work through and generally involve ongoing issues. \nFinally, there are \"staff action\" grievances in which there is an allegation that a staff member has \nacted inappropriately. This last category has proven to be very difficult to handle within the WGS. \nIncreased concern over the years by the CCPOA has meant that staff action grievances must be \nhandled  via  more  formalized  investigatory processes.  The  older tradition of alternative  dispute \nresolution that was the origin of the WGS has given way to a very different organizational method \nfor handling staff action grievances. \nMy interviews with wards suggested that the WGS system was not functioning as intended. \nMost of the wards told me that they never filed grievances, because that the WGS did not work. \nMany wards laughed at the question \"Does the WGS help you resolve problems?\" Several of the \nwards that I interviewed were WGS clerks, and they offered a similarly negative view of the process. \nWards  complained that they were more likely to  try to  work out issues via conversations  with \nsympathetic staff members, or by discussing problems with living unit supervisors. About half the \n71 \n\n---.---\nwards felt that the WGS had helped them resolve fairly minor personal issues, but that the system \nwas  useless  for  handling  bigger  problems  including  the  use  of force,  denial  of treatment  or \neducational services, or gaining better access to medical and dental care.  Wards reported that they \nwere often told that their complaints did not fit under the jurisdiction of the WGS, but they remained \naware of other formal channels that they could utilize to solve these concerns. For example, many \nwards wanted to complain about their treatment by the YOPB, such as for extending their terms, but \nthe YA staff told them that the WGS was not designed to hear complaints against the YOPB. Several \nof the  WGS  clerks claimed that  some wards  used the system to  provoke the staff,  or that they \ngrieved fairly minor issues that could be resolved through more dialogue between wards and staff. \nIt is in the area of staff action grievances that wards were most negative about the WGS. \nMany wards told me that staff and the WGS clerks often discouraged them from filing staff action \ngrievances. The wards were told that these matters would \"go nowhere\" and that filing grievances \nmight lead to harsher treatment by the staff. Some wards suspected that their grievances were \"lost\" \nby the WGS clerks and never forwarded to institutional managers. Further, the wards complained to \nme that they never heard back on the resolution of their grievances. They were either told that an \ninquiry was ongoing, or that the.matter had been dismissed. The wards claimed that they were never \ngiven an explanation of what had detennined the outcome of the grievance. The wards reported that \nstaff action grievances took a very long time to resolve. \nThese findings were reinforced by a review of the WGS conducted by the Y A Compliance \nReview Unit (Report to  The  Director on  Staff Action  Grievances,  July  2003).  This review was \nintended  to  detennine if the  various  institutions  were  complying with  policies  and  procedures \ngoverning the timeliness of responses to staff action grievances. To complete this study, the CRU \ninterviewed 44  Sergeants or Senior YCCs. In addition, interviews were conducted with 237 wards, \n72 \n\nof which only 66 reported that they had ever filed a grievance. The Compliance Review Unit also \ninterviewed 44 WGS clerks. \nThis review confirmed and enhanced many of my own interviews and observations with \nY A staff and wards. The CRU concluded that Y A employees from line staff to superintendents were \nnot following  the  proper policies and procedures relative to  the  WGS  as  delineated in the  I&C \nManual and more recent Temporary Policy and Procedure notices. It was found that virtually every \ninstitution had its own interpretation of the WGS policies and procedures, and staff at these facilities \nhad their own interpretations of how the WGS was supposed to operate. The CRU acknowledged \nthat  each  facility  has  special  issues  and  differing  types  of wards,  but  they  found  almost  no \nconsistency across the YA   in dealing with staff action grievances. Even very basic processes on how \nto file a grievance varied from place to place. \nThe CRU found that wards were not receiving education as to how the WGS should \nfunction. Wards are typically given a very basic introduction to their rights as part of the orientation \nprocess at the Reception Centers, but this training is not followed up once they are assigned to other \nYA institutions. Many of the wards that I interviewed asked for a copy ofthe Ward's Rights Manual. \nAlthough wards were usually given a copy of this document at the Reception Centers, these manuals \nwere often lost as the wards moved to new institutions or to other living units. Several of the living \nunits did not have copies ofthe manuals at the living units for wards and staff to consult on a regular \nbasis. \nThe CRU found that many WGS  clerks and Y A staff had an inadequate understanding \nabout how to properly complete the WGS forms. Processes by which staff action grievances were \ndistributed and collected to insure that the complaints were not misplaced or destroyed varied across \nall  of the  institutions  examined by the  CRU  The  review  also  revealed  that these  methods  of \ndistribution and collection were different among various living units at the same institutions. Wards \n73 \n\n---'---\" \nwho were transferred between Y A facilities,  rarely,  if ever, heard back on the resolution of staff \naction grievances that they filed at their initial placement. \nDenial  of  staff  action  grievances  can  be  made  by  the  superintendent,  assistant \nsuperintendent, or a designated staff person. But, the CRU found that a wide range of staff including \nthe  Duty  Lieutenants,  Program  Administrators,  Treatment Team  Supervisors  or Sergeants  may \nanswer the grievances and determine if the complaint meets the appropriate criteria. Current Policy \ndoes not clearly define who can be designated to act on behalf of the superintendent, or what specific \ntraining in the WGS that these staff should receive. \nThe CRU also reported that wards were not given very much information about why staff \naction grievances were being denied. The wards were usually told that the complaint did not meet \nthe criteria, or they were encouraged to re-file their grievance as a regular grievance. Similar to my \nfindings, many of the wards that were interviewed by the CRU said that line staff at 9 of the 11 Y A \ninstitutions has denied them the right to file a staff action grievance. The CRU reported that wards at \nHGS were told to put off their complaints or that the wards were told by the WGS clerks that \"its not \ngoing  anywhere,  you're  going  to  get  bad  luck  form  it.\"  YA  policies  require  that  staff action \ngrievances be answered after hours or on weekends by the Duty Lieutenant, but the CRU found that \nthis was not occurring at half ofthe Y A institutions. \nThe Y A internal review found that timeliness of responses to staff action grievances was a \nproblem. The CRU found that the response due dates were lacking in about half of the grievances \nthat they reviewed. They also found that only half of the staff action grievances had the dates noted \nby the superintendents. Many responses were delivered after the time frames set forth in Y A policy. \nDuring my interviews at six Y A facilities, each of the ward's rights coordinators told me that the \nexisting time  frames  to  process  the  staff action  grievances  were  too  short.  They reported  that \ndeadlines were 0 ften missed and these inquiries took a good deal of staff time and effort. \n74 \n\nSummary and Recommendations \nMy  own  analysis  and  the  work  of the  CRU  strongly  suggest  that  there  are  major \ndeficiencies  in  the  WGS.  Many wards  seem  unwilling to  file  grievances,  especially those  that \ninvolve complaints  against  staff.  This  means  that YA   managers  may not  learn  about all  of the \npotential  problems  that  should catch their  attention.  Often wards  would  complain  to  me  about \nspecific staff abuses, inadequate medical care, or about fears for their safety. Often the response to \nmy inquiries  about these matters  to  the  institutional management was  that \"the ward did  file  a \ngrievance on this matter.\" This is a classic \"Catch 22\" situation. To the extent that wards do not trust \nthe WGS, they are less likely to file complaints. Middle level and top level managers assume that the \nabsence of formal grievances implies the absence of problems. By letting the WGS fall apart, the YA   \nis losing a crucial indicator of potential management issues that could be addressed via preventive or \nearly interventions. \n! \nI \nI  The WGS seems to work for some wards that like to use the process to solve some of their \n\\ \nbasic issues or needs. For wards who have difficulty communicating verbally or in writing, the WGS \nI  provides obstacles to resolving issues. I found that the WGS clerks worked hard to assist other wards \nwho needed some help in negotiating the process.  These clerks were often frustrated if the staff \nresponse to the grievances did not appear to follow policy, or if the ward was not properly informed \nabout the status of his complaints or the reasons why his grievance was denied. \nThe WGS needs a major overhaul in the handling of staff action grievances. In a sense, it \nappears  that  serious  complaints  against  staff require  a  very  different  process.  The  traditional \napproach  in  handling  ward  grievances  was  mediation  and,  ultimately,  arbitration.  But,  if the \ncomplaint is defined by Y A as a staff action grievance, an entirely different set of actors and actions \n75 \n\ncome  into  play.  The  response  to  staff action  is  more akin  to  a  conventional  investigation  and \npersonnel review process. Mixing the two models insures long time frames, limited communication \nback to wards, and a good deal of frustration on the part of wards, staff, and superintendents. \nThe Y A needs to reexamine the areas in which the WGS system, with its preference toward \nmediation and mutually agreeable conflict resolution, is the better approach. There are clearly some \nareas in which allegations of staff misconduct must be fairly and fully investigated with appropriate \nrespect given to  the rights of the staff member and the ward.  Perhaps;  there is method of early \nintervention and mediation that might be appropriate for certain kinds of ward complaints against \nstaff. At present the complain system is muddled and is not working effectively. \nWards need a better foundation in the rights to which they are entitled, and the methods \nopen to them to exercise these rights. The other side of rights is, of course, the responsibilities that \nwards must accept to meet the expectations 'of the YA  . The current orientation in wards rights that \noccurs at the Reception Centers is insufficient. Educational curriculum on wards' rights should be \npart of the orientation as they arrive at a new facility, and as they are assigned to living units. The \nYA should make sure, on a regular basis, that each ward has an up-to-date copy ofthe Ward's Rights \nManual. Moreover, copies of the Ward's Rights Manual should be readily available on each living \nunit  and  in the classrooms  and  library.  Discussions  about  rights  and  responsibilities  should be \nintegrated into the individual and group therapy sessions that most wards receive. \nCurrent policies and procedures on the WGS are very well written and very clear. These \nare some of the best formulated of the YA   policies. The issue here is about implementation. The YA   \ncannot  allow  each  institution  to  make  up  its  own  rules;  facilities  should  not  allow  individual \nemployees to impose their interpretations about how the WGS should operate. If the WGS is to be \nrescued from obsolescence, there must be a very high priority placed on training or retraining all \nlevels of staff on the goals of the WGS and the proscribed methods of meeting those department-\n76 \n\nwide objectives. Most important, the YA must communicate to all staff that the WGS system is not a \nnuisance to be tolerated, but rather is crucial to the safe and efficient management of the institution. \nAs with other areas of this review, the rebuilding of the WGS requires continuolls and close \nmonitoring by the Compliance Review Unit through ongoing and periodic audits of the functioning \nof the WGS at each Y A institution. It is also recommended that the YA   management demonstrate \nthe  importance  of the  WGS  by requiring that each  institution convene top  managers  to  review \nmonthly grievance data, similar to the use of force committees. Routine examinations of WGS data \ncould highlight areas  for  improved training and better operations. More serious  problems could \nidentified at  earlier stages when remedial actions can be taken.  Moreover, these regular reviews \nwould communicate to staff and wards that the WGS has the capacity to help resolve both individual \nconcerns and institutional problems. \nV. ACCESS TO RELIGIOUS SERVICES \n•  Are wards housed in restricted housing units given adequate access to religious materials \nand services: \n•  Are Are wards housed in general population given adequate access to religious materials \nand services? \n•  Are the CYA 's procedures/or documenting ward access to religious services adequate? \n•  Are the CYA's written policies and procedures adequate to protect its ward's religious \nrights? \nInitial concerns about Y A policies and practices about access to religious services and \nprograms were raised by a number of faith-based groups such as the Catholic Archdiocese of Los \n77 \n\nAngeles.  Issues pertaining to the exercise of religious beliefs are often brought to the attention of the \nYA   through letters to the Director, correspondence with the Ombudspersons, and the WGS. \nMy interviews with both Y A Ombudspersons revealed that occasional complaints about \naccess to religious services did come to their attention. Looking at the first 6 months of 2003, ward \ncorrespondence to the Director was the main topic of 17 or 13 percent of these letters. Only ward \nsafety issues and concerns about transfers generated more letters. There were 10 letters concerning \ndenial of religious practices at HGS, 4 at Chad, and one each at Nelles, Holton, and the Northern \nCalifornia Reception Center. Complaints about access to religious programs and services accounted \nfor 31 % of all the letters from wards at HGS and were the most frequent area of concern from wards \nat that facility. Similarly, an examination of ward grievances filed in Fiscal Year 2002-2003 showed \na significant number of complaints about access to religious programs and services. There were 66 \ngrievances about religious issues filed at Chad, 13 at Ventura, 12 at HGS, 3\" at Preston, and two each \nat EI Paso De Robles, and Nelles. \nRecognizing traditional problems with respect to the religious observances of wards, the \nYA  · leadership  has  convened  a special  staff working  group  that  will produce a  comprehensive \nrestatement of departmental policies and procedures in this area. The new policies were finalized on \nApril 16, 2003 and went into effect on Sept, 1, 2003. The Y A is now moving forward to make this \npolicy the foundation of departmental policies on religious observance. The new policy is more than \nthree times as long as the one it replaces, giving excellent levels of detail on questions about access \nto religious practices, attendance at religious services, limitations of religious practice, and the role \nof Chaplains. \nDuring my site visits to six institutions, I interviewed at least one, and sometimes all, ofthe \nChaplains at these facilities. They were asked to provide documentation on the nature and extent of \nreligious services being provided. I also asked them to outline any major concerns or issues that they \n78 \n\nhad as the primary Y A staff responsible for seeing that all wards had access to appropriate religious \neducation and expression. My interviews with wards at these facilities also covered their experiences \nwith accessing religious services and programs. \nDespite general agreement on the part of the Chaplains that the new Y A policies would \nimprove matters, there were still concerns over the implementation of those policies at each of the \ninstitutions.  Staff were  still unclear about reasons  why some wards  could be  denied temporary \nattendance at religious services. For example, some staff in the living units continued to impose their \nown definitions about the \"sincerity\" of the ward's religious beliefs-some staff believe that wards \nmanipulate these activities to pursue gang activities or to  attack other wards. Further, some staff \nwere not responsive to ward requests to change their religious designation so that they could attend \nadditional or different religious services or programs. Staff were more likely to deny wards access to \nreligious programs, even though Y A policies  give these programs equivalent weight as  religious \nservices. There was also continuing confusion on the part of some staff that wards in the lowest \nphase levels could be denied access to religious programs or services as part of other limitations of \nprivileges for these wards. The Y A Central Office is working to resolve these issues. For example, \nthe wards who wish to sign up for religious programming now are entered into the computer system \non a weekly basis, and any denials of these requests must be noted. This new system seems to be \nworking at most facilities, although some Chaplains have expressed concern that the new approach \nrequires that wards sign up every week, rather than assuming that they are automatically enrolled in \nscheduled religious services and programs. \nOther  related  issues  that  were· raised  in  the  past  concern  the  delivery  of religious \nprogramming to wards in restricted living units. While these wards cannot generally attend regular \nreligious services, the Chaplains have regular weekly visits to the lockup units and see whichever \nwards want to avail themselves of these contacts. \n79 \n\nMy  interviews  with  wards  surfaced  a  number  of concerns  about  access  to  religious \nservices. For example, several wards who have work assignments told me that their work supervisors \nwould not give them time off for religious activities. This is clearly contrary to Y A policies and must \nbe  clarified  with  all  staff who  run the  work details.  Two wards  complained that the Protestant \nChaplain denied them access to  religious  education (but not religious  services) because of their \navowed homosexual orientations. I raised this issue with the facility superintendent who has already \nclarified to this Chaplain that all wards who wish to attend religious services and programs can do so \nunless there is demonstrable threat to safety and security. \nA more serious issues has to do with the limited religious personnel who are available for \nwards who are either Native American practitioners or Muslims. While there are full-time Protestant \nand  Catholic  Chaplains  at  all  YA institutions,  it is  the  case that Native American and Muslim \nChaplains generally work part-time. Only Paso has a full-time Muslim chaplain. For example, the \nNative American and Muslim religious leaders at Chad both work part-time and have to service all 4 \nfacilities at the Stockton complex. Religious leaders for wards who are interested in groups such as \nLatter  Day Saints,  Buddhists,  Jehovah's  Witnesses,  and  others  are  provided  religious  services \nthrough  volunteers  that  are  recruited  from  the  community by  the  current  Y A  Chaplains.  The \nallocation of paid time for Chaplains is decided at the individual institutional level and comes out of \nfacility budgets. The Y A periodically takes a inventory of the religious preferences of wards, but \nthese  data  are  not  used  to  establish  staffing  patterns  for  those  staff responsible  for  religious \nprogramming. Moreover, many superintendents expressed difficulties in recruiting Native American \npractitioners or Muslim Imam from their neighboring communities. Consequently, these positions \nmay be vacant for long periods of time. There is little question that wards interested in pursuing \nNative American and Muslim faiths are not getting a fair share of Y A resources that are devoted to \n80 \n\nreligious programming. There remain serious questions as to whether some of these youths are de \n.f acto being denied access to religious observance due to Y A organizational and budgetary practices. \nSome ward expressed complaints about Y A requirements with respect to the amount of \nfacial hair that they are permitted, or the overall length of their hair. Staff have raised security issues \nin some cases, and the wards may view staff restrictions as violations of their core religious beliefs. \nThe Y A's new policies go far in the direction of clarifying the appropriate responses to these \nconflicts. Other wards expressed complaints about being denied access to certain religious groups \nthat Y A officials believe can ferment racial hatred in Y A facilities. The Y A Legal Office spends a \nfair amount oftime screening materials for content that appears to advocate violent activities. The \ncurrent policy allows wards wide latitude in selecting religious groups with whom they might want \nto communicate, but it seems entirely reasonable that materials or persons urging racial warfare not \nbe permitted in Y A institutions. \nSummary and Recommendations \nThe Y A recognizes that access to religious services and programs is a central constitutional \nand statutory requirement for wards. The new policies move the Department forward in these areas. \nFurther, the Chaplains and the volunteers that they recruit provide an important contribution to the \nYA mission of education and treatment. The major unresolved issues have to do with implementing \nthe new Y A policies. \nAs with other topics covered in this  report,  the provision of religion is variable across \nindividual facilities and living units. Staff have yet to receive sufficient training in the new policies, \nand monitoring of compliance at either level of superintendents or the Central Office is extremely \nI  uneven or non-existent. For example, the Chaplains at one facility reported that no wards had signed \nI \nI \n81 \n\n--\n--------------\nup for any religious programming at several living units for several weeks, but this odd result did not \ntrigger an administrative review. The Chaplains visited these units and found a range of reasons why \nstaff were not complying with new Y A  policies.  Training  of line  staff,  middle  managers,  and \nsuperintendents in the importance of providing all wards access to religious services and programs \nmust take on a higher priority in Y A training activities. \nY A  should reorganize the  provision of religious  programming under the  leadership of \nCentral Office staff.  There needs to  be a rational basis that allocates staff resources to  religious \nprogramming,  and this  policy should be consistent across  all  facilities.  The YA should be very \nfocused on providing appropriate religious staffing to all wards, especially to Native Americans and \nMuslims. Provision of these religious personnel should not be the sole responsibility of facility \nsuperintendents.  Also,  the  provision  of services  to  some  wards  that  depends  entirely  on  the \navailability of community volunteers, should be replaced with a system of providing fair stipends for \nthese individuals. The Y A should develop an operational manual for its Chaplains and offer regular \ntraining to them. The Chaplains need an organized way to raise their concerns and suggestions to top \nY A leadership about how to upgrade the delivery of religious programs and services. This would be \nparticularly important in areas in which custody and security concerns often interrupt or halt the \nprovision of religious services and programs. \nAt the institutional level there is no consistency in how the Chaplains are integrated into \nfacility management teams. All the ofthe Chaplains that I talked with suggested that they could help \ninstitutional  staff by offering  insights  to  areas  like  ward  safety,  suicide  prevention,  improved \neducational  services, and the  use  of force.  Chaplains can  be  very effective in engaging wards, \nespecially those who are emotionally distraught. The Chaplains shoulder the major responsibility of \ninforming wards and staff about deaths and serious illnesses in their families. The Chaplains already \nput in large amounts of time, with minimal compensation. They most often work on weekends and in \n82 \n\nthe evenings so as not to interfere with the school schedule; but, they all volunteered to do more to \nadvance the mission of the YA  . Creating a formal department-wide recognition of the great value of \nthese contributions,  and making the Chaplains  full  participants in  institutional leadership  teams, \nwould be an important step. The Central Office could model this behavior, by increasing the role of \nChaplaincy, in all of its major management deliberations. \nI \nI \nI \nI \nI \n83 ",

Juvenile wards of the state are confined within the California Youth\n3 Authority (CYA) for rehabilitation, training and treatment.  (Welf. & Inst. Code § 1700.) \n4 These important objectives cannot be achieved under the inhumane conditions that\n5 currently exist in the CYA.  Rehabilitation cannot succeed when the classroom is a cage\n6 and wards live in constant fear of physical and sexual violence from CYA staff and other\n7 wards.  Effective training is not possible when CYA programs are not available and CYA\n8 staff are inadequate in both numbers and experience.  Treatment is undermined when\n9 forced administration of psychotropic medication is used as a tool to control behavior,\n10 and it is impossible when psychologists and psychiatrists are not available to the vast\n11 majority of wards.  The severe, unconstitutional and illegal problems plaguing the CYA\n12 are not new and they are not a secret.  Defendant Jerry Harper, Director of the CYA,\n13 lacks the resources, staff, and management controls necessary to provide appropriate\n14 assistance, services and treatment. \n15 2. This taxpayer action is brought by Margaret Farrell to compel defendant\n16 Harper to remedy the illegal, inhumane, discriminatory and punitive conditions that exist\n17 throughout the CYA.  Plaintiff seeks a declaration that defendant Harper has wasted\n18 taxpayer funds on illegal policies, practices, and procedures, and seeks an injunction\n19 requiring defendant to meet his constitutional and statutory obligations.\n20 JURISDICTION\n21 3. This Court has jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief on behalf of plaintiff\n22 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 525 and 526.\n23 4. This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief on behalf of plaintiff\n24 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060.\n25 PARTIES\n26 A.   Plaintiff\n27 5. Plaintiff Margaret Farrell is a citizen of California and a resident of Reseda\n28\n2\n\n1 in Los Angeles County.  She has paid taxes to the State of California within one year of\n2 the commencement of this action.  As a taxpayer, plaintiff Farrell has no administrative\n3 remedies to exhaust.  Ms. Farrell’s nephew, Edward Jermaine Brown, is a CYA ward. \n4 She brings this action as a taxpayer, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526a,\n5 against state official Jerry L. Harper, Director of the CYA, to enjoin his expenditure of\n6 funds to promulgate, administer, and enforce the CYA’s illegal and wasteful policies and\n7 practices.\n8 B.   Defendant\n9 6. Jerry L. Harper is the Director of the CYA and is sued herein in that\n10 capacity.  As Director, Harper is responsible for the operation of all the CYA staff and\n11 facilities, including decisions concerning the budget, staff deployment, programming, and\n12 staff training that directly affect the expenditure of funds on CYA wards.\n13 7. Defendant uses tax revenues collected from plaintiff Farrell and others by\n14 the State of California to administer, operate, and maintain CYA facilities.\n15 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n16 8. The CYA is a state agency charged with the rehabilitation of youthful\n17 offenders.  It is directed by the California Legislature to substitute training and treatment\n18 for punishment of its wards.  (Welf. & Inst. Code § 1700.)  The CYA houses\n19 approximately 6,000 male and female wards in eleven correctional facilities.  \n20 9. Defendant Harper’s agency violates the rights of wards and wastes taxpayer\n21 money on illegal and often abhorrent conditions and practices, many of which are\n22 detailed below.  The CYA, by its own admission, utterly fails to fulfill its statutory duties\n23 of treatment and rehabilitation.  For example, the CYA admits that it does not provide\n24 wards at N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility with adequate treatment and\n25 programming services.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2001-02; Budget Concept Paper FY\n26 2002-03.)  Staff at this CYA facility, which houses some of the most at-risk youth in the\n27 system, are “unable to provide quality treatment to wards due [to] the high number of\n28\n3\n\n1 difficult and complex cases at the facility.”  Without additional staff, “N.A. Chaderjian\n2 will continue to operate without adequate treatment services, which leads to an unsafe\n3 environment for staff and wards.”  Wards at Ventura Youth Correctional Facility are also\n4 “consistently denied the treatment services to which they are entitled” by California law,\n5 according to the Office of the Inspector General in a Management Review Audit of June\n6 2002.  \n7 10. More generally, the CYA’s own Treatment Delivery Focus Group found in\n8 November 2001 that, because untrained, inexperienced correctional officers are staffing\n9 counselor positions, “we are unable to effectively deliver treatment and training to the\n10 wards under our care and supervision.”  (Memorandum from Treatment Delivery Focus\n11 Group to Deputy Director Anderson, November 16, 2001.) One result of the CYA’s\n12 failure to provide rehabilitation to wards is that “wards are give[n] time-adds because\n13 their board ordered programs cannot be met.” \n14 11. Defendant Harper has long been aware of the CYA’s chronic, serious\n15 illegalities and its leadership failures.  As the CYA states: \n16 In August 2000 the department performed an analysis of critical issues and\nreports.... The analysis revealed the following broad areas of concerns:\n17 conditions of confinement; use of force; safety and security; management of\npolicy, procedure and practice; correctional treatment centers; staff\n18 resources and training; ward rights; drug and sex offender treatment;\neducation services; leadership; gangs; research; and [] documentation.  In\n19 practically every issue, inconsistent policy, procedure and practice was\neither explicitly noted or implied as an underlying factor.”  \n20\n(Budget Change Proposal EX03A, FY 2002-03.)  CYA’s deficiencies have, if anything,\n21\nworsened since that time.  \n22\nA.  Physical Safety of Wards\n23\n12. CYA staff regularly subject wards to the excessive use of force, in violation\n24\nof the California Constitution, Article I, sections 1 (right to enjoy life, liberty, and safety),\n25\n///\n26\n///\n27\n///\n28\n4\n\n1 7 (right to due process), and 17 (no cruel or unusual punishment)1; Penal Code sections\n2 147 (willful inhumanity or oppression by peace officers), 149 (unnecessary assaults by\n3 peace officers), and 673 (ban on “cruel, corporal or unusual punishment” and the\n4 “inflict[ion of] any treatment or allow[ance of] any lack of care whatever which would\n5 injure or impair the health of the [ward]”); and the California Code of Regulations, title\n6 15, sections 4039 and 4040 (restrictions on use of force and chemical and mechanical\n7 restraints).  Defendant Harper has failed to establish policies and procedures adequate to\n8 ensure the physical safety of wards under the care and protection of the CYA and to\n9 protect them from abuse by CYA staff that is cruel, willfully inhumane, and excessive. \n10 Mr. Harper has also failed to ensure that the policies now in place are properly\n11 implemented and that staff are trained to follow them.  As a result, he has wasted and\n12 continues to waste taxpayer funds by operating a system rife with unsafe and illegal\n13 conditions of confinement.  \n14 13. It is common practice within the CYA for staff and/or guards to slam a\n15 ward down, pull his arms behind his back, force a knee in his back, and use excessive\n16 amounts of Mace or other chemical agents even after the ward is restrained.  Wards also\n17 have had their heads slammed against walls and rails and have been beaten and burned by\n18 tear gas canisters and Maced for no reason.  For example, a ward was repeatedly sprayed\n19 with chemical agents for declining to undergo a strip search after being placed in a\n20 holding room.  In another incident, a ward was knocked unconscious when shot directly\n21 in the head at close range by CYA staff with a “foam baton” gun.  In at third incident,\n22 CYA officers placed a handcuffed ward face down on a bed and repeatedly struck his\n23 head.  \n24 14. Although California law mandates that chemical restraints shall be used\n25\n26\n1This and all future references to Article I, section 17, of the California\n27\nConstitution (cruel or unusual punishment clause) apply to those wards held in the CYA\npursuant to criminal convictions.  \n28\n5\n\n1 only to restrain wards, and never for punishment or retaliation (Cal. Code of Regs., tit.\n2 15, § 4040(d)), CYA staff often use chemical agents on wards who either do not require\n3 restraining or already are restrained.  Additionally, staff place other excessive restrictions\n4 on wards, in the form of restraint chairs and “spit masks” (which often must be worn by\n5 wards for a month or more) or confinement to a temporary detention or suicide watch\n6 room for extended periods of time without legitimate justification.\n7 15. Many CYA staff do not abide by the rules and policies that currently exist\n8 to govern the use of force on wards.  The policies are often not provided to staff, and staff\n9 training is inadequate.   In addition, the CYA administration has failed to provide\n10 individual institutions with oversight and clear policy direction on the use of force.  Staff\n11 often fail to report the use of force and the CYA does not adequately investigate use-of-\n12 force incidents or discipline staff when appropriate.  As a result of these failures,\n13 implementation of CYA use-of-force policies throughout the system is inadequate, which\n14 causes and exacerbates the illegalities of the CYA system. \n15 16. Moreover, the use-of-force policies are themselves inadequate.  For\n16 example, there is no standardized policy to govern use of spit masks.  The CYA’s\n17 chemical restraints policy does not set dosage limits on the use of chemical restraints. \n18 The policies and procedures for proper inventory controls and records for weapons,\n19 ammunition, and chemical agents are inadequate.  Without such policies and procedures,\n20 there is insufficient management control over the use of force and the application of\n21 chemicals on wards.\n22 17. The San Luis Obispo Grand Jury, in its investigation of Paso Robles Youth\n23 Correctional Facility in 2000,  found that “[a]ccountability procedures are ineffective for\n24 signaling possible unauthorized use of chemical restraint by individual employees, nor\n25 are other adequate safeguards in place.”  The Grand Jury found excessive use of chemical\n26 restraints at Cambria Cottage, the Paso Robles lockup unit: “[T]here has been an\n27 excessive use of chemical restraint.  Foggers have been used there as weapons for\n28\n6\n\n1 individual punishments as well as for extracting some wards from their cells.”  Although\n2 the Paso Robles Superintendent and Chief of Security knew of these problems, there is no\n3 evidence that they conducted investigations of any individual incidents. \n4 18. Defendant Harper also has failed to develop sufficient policies and\n5 procedures to protect the physical safety of wards from abuse by other wards and has\n6 failed adequately to implement those policies and procedures that do exist.  As a result,\n7 conditions in the CYA violate the California Constitution, Article I, sections 1 (right to\n8 enjoy life, liberty, and safety), 7 (right to due process), and 17 (no cruel or unusual\n9 punishment).  For example, many CYA facilities house victims of sexual violence and/or\n10 homosexual wards with convicted sex offenders.  Wards who are homosexual or who are\n11 known to have been victimized in the past are the most frequent targets of sexual assault. \n12 Thus, the CYA is exposing some of its most vulnerable wards to some of its most\n13 dangerous.  \n14 19. Rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment are common within the CYA. \n15 Some wards are housed in the same living facility as others who have previously raped or\n16 sexually assaulted them.  Staff are routinely indifferent to wards’ requests for protection\n17 from those who have assaulted them. \n18 20. Defendant Harper has failed properly to implement the CYA’s own\n19 guidelines for responding to wards’ reports of sexual assault, including failing to\n20 investigate such allegations promptly and properly, and has failed to develop and\n21 implement policies to ensure that CYA staff members receive instruction in dealing with\n22 sexual assault and are held accountable when they disregard policy.\n23 21. The California Correctional Peace Officers Association reports that violent\n24 female wards at Ventura “prey on weaker/mentally ill wards” and “management... has no\n25 plan to defuse, eliminate or reduce violence within the female population.”  (CCPOA\n26 Agenda, CYA Director’s Meeting, Tuesday, August 15, 2000.)\n27 22. Defendant Harper has failed to establish policies and procedures to protect\n28\n7\n\n1 wards from the well-known and ubiquitous danger of attack by gang members and does\n2 not have a consistent policy for dealing with gang-related violence.  Moreover, he has\n3 failed to provide intervention services for gang conflict.  The use of long-term lockdowns\n4 as the sole response to gang violence results in more physical violence because wards are\n5 simply locked in their rooms for weeks or months with no programming and no\n6 constructive release for their frustration, tension and fear.  \n7 23. Gang-related violence occurs in the form of both one-on-one attacks and\n8 large-group disturbances.  Wards often are seriously injured in such attacks, which can\n9 involve dangerous weapons such as knives or similar objects.  The CYA does not have\n10 adequate policies and procedures to ensure that wards do not have access to material that\n11 can be made into dangerous weapons.  Debris such as broken glass, nails, a tent stake, a\n12 12-inch piece of pipe, a six-inch piece of metal, and an 18-inch strand of rope have been\n13 left in the corner of a sports field, accessible to wards, in at least one CYA facility. \n14 Moreover, CYA staff fail to search wards for weapons adequately to prevent contraband\n15 from entering the facilities and fail to use metal detectors properly.  \n16 24. In addition to their failure to prevent ward-on-ward violence, CYA staff\n17 have actually encouraged, permitted, and/or provided wards with the opportunity to fight\n18 each other. \n19 B.   Segregation\n20 25. CYA wards are subject to extremely harsh punishment in the form of\n21 “lockup,” “Temporary Detention,” “disciplinary housing,” placement on “Special\n22 Management Units” (SMU), and “lockdowns.”  Such punishment is effected either by\n23 sending a ward to a special housing unit used specifically for such punishment or by\n24 changing the rules of confinement for a ward or group of wards while they remain in\n25 regular housing units. \n26 26. The physical conditions within special lockup units are often abysmal, in\n27 violation of the California Constitution, Article I, sections 1 (right to enjoy life, liberty,\n28\n8\n\n1 and safety), 7 (right to due process), and 17 (no cruel or unusual punishment); Penal\n2 Code section 673 (ban on “cruel, corporal or unusual punishment” and the “inflict[ion of]\n3 any treatment or allow[ance of] any lack of care whatever which would injure or impair\n4 the health of the [ward]”); and the California Code of Regulations, title 15, section 4125\n5 (nutritionally adequate and acceptable diet required).  Defendant Harper has failed to\n6 establish policies and procedures adequate to protect the rights of wards undergoing such\n7 punishment.  He has also failed to ensure that the policies now in place are properly\n8 implemented and that staff are trained to follow them.  As a result, he has wasted and\n9 continues to waste taxpayer funds by operating a system rife with unsafe and illegal\n10 conditions of confinement. \n11 27. Many lockup rooms are filthy, with dried mucus, blood, and/or feces on the\n12 walls, inadequate or nonfunctional toilets, and broken windows.  Wards are subject to\n13 health risks due to these unsanitary conditions.  Wards on lockup are often fed only\n14 “blender meals,” which are entire meals (e.g., a sandwich, vegetable, and milk) that have\n15 been put into a blender and liquified and then fed to the ward through a straw through his\n16 or her cell door.  Other times, wards confined on lockup have received inadequate rations\n17 or dangerously undercooked food, causing these adolescents and young adults to lose\n18 significant amounts of weight. \n19 28. Wards’ activities while on lockup are so severely limited as to be punitive. \n20 Wards live under a regime commonly called “23/1,” which forces them to stay inside\n21 their cells for 23 hours of the day and provides only one hour of “program” time outside\n22 of the cell, which takes place in cages called Special (or Secure) Program Areas or\n23 “SPAs.”  Thus, when wards on lockup are allowed to attend educational classes or\n24 counseling sessions, they are required to do so either in a cage or through a small slot in\n25 the cell door.  Wards on lockup often are not permitted access to reading material,\n26 television, or radio and their opportunities to keep in contact with their families through\n27 telephone calls and visits are severely curtailed in violation of the California Code of\n28\n9\n\n1 Regulations, title 15, sections 4696 (visiting shall take place at least once a week and\n2 shall not be restricted as a disciplinary measure) and 4699 (wards shall be allowed to\n3 make “periodic telephone calls”).  Although CYA policy mandates that wards on lockup\n4 shall be given the opportunity for one hour of large-muscle exercise outside of their\n5 rooms each day, in practice this regulation is ignored and wards on lockup can go for\n6 months or even more than a year with little or no exercise.  \n7 29. Wards often are not allowed to attend school or any other form of program,\n8 including religious services, while in segregation, in violation of the California\n9 Constitution, Article I, section 4 (freedom of religion), and Welfare and Institutions Code\n10 sections 1120 et seq. (right to education for CYA wards) and 1705 (freedom of religion\n11 for CYA wards); see also Serrano v. Priest (1977) 18 Cal.3d 728, 765-66 (fundamental\n12 right to education).  Some wards are denied parole because they cannot complete required\n13 programs in lockup; they then serve their maximum term and are released from the CYA\n14 with a dishonorable discharge.  The California Department of Education investigated the\n15 CYA’s delivery of special education services to wards on lockdown or temporary\n16 detention and found that the CYA “is not consistently implementing the IEPs [Individual\n17 Education Plans] of wards/students in the restricted program”and that “IEP team meetings\n18 are not conducted when a ward is placed in the restricted program as directed in the\n19 CYA’s Restricted Program policy manual” and as required under federal law.  (California\n20 Department of Education Compliance Report #I-1079-00/01, September 14, 2001.)\n21 30. Wards in segregation are there primarily due to the CYA’s determination\n22 that they have misbehaved or failed to follow mandated programs.  However, they are not\n23 provided with any behavior modification or rehabilitative programs to assist them in\n24 improving their conduct.  \n25 31. Many wards with serious mental illnesses are held in lockup under these\n26 extremely harsh and restrictive conditions, which exacerbates their mental illnesses and\n27 causes them to decompensate. \n28\n10\n\n1 32. CYA wards spend an alarming amount of time in segregation.  The CYA’s\n2 policies and practices on locking wards up in segregation is so excessive as to violate\n3 accepted professional practices, particularly for wards who are mentally ill and/or\n4 suicidal.\n5 33. A pastoral delegation to Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility\n6 reported in a document sent to Mr. Harper on November 27, 2001, that they were\n7 shocked and depressed by the isolation and the use of cages, or as you call\nthem SPAs.  The accommodations were, in our opinion, inhumane.  We\n8 were also alarmed by the length of time the young men spend in isolation. \nMany we talked to had been there several months already and were not sure\n9 when they would return to the main population. \n10 The delegation of clergy further stated regarding the lockup units at Nelles: “The paucity\n11 of education, physical exercise, religious programming and social interaction for young\n12 people of this age is nothing short of abusive.”  The CYA chaplain’s group expressed a\n13 similar concern to Mr. Harper, stating:\n14 There have been three suicides in the CYA system since February.  We are\nhearing from the wards that the amount of time they spend in their rooms\n15 agitates the stress and tensions that they already experience by being locked\nup.  The over use of solitary confinement (23-1) including their length of\n16 stay in solitary confinement units and the use of SPAs for their one hour out\nof their rooms also contributes to this concern.  Many wards have confided\n17 to us that they are hesitant to seek help for stress or depression for fear that\nthey will be put on suicide watch, which is worse than solitary confinement. \n18 Isolation[] increases the likelihood of suicide, it does not decrease it. \n19 34. The CYA admits that its policies regarding the use of restricted programs\n20 lack consistent placement criteria and are marked by the “inconsistent delivery of\n21 mandated services in the areas of education, recreation, telephone calls, visiting, ward\n22 grievances, legal resources, religious services, mail, nutrition, clothing/bedding, mental\n23 health services and counseling and treatment.”  (Budget Change Proposal EX03A, FY\n24 2002-03.)   In addition, the CYA has “no consistent monitoring of the use of 23/1\n25 restricted programs.”  Furthermore, the CYA is aware that its use of cages on the\n26 restricted programs is ineffective and cruel: the CYA’s own Special Programs\n27 Administrator has recommended “complete removal of all special program areas [SPAs]\n28\n11\n\n1 with time of the essence.  These hardware devices are used in a similar manner to other\n2 mechanical restraints in the absence of intensive treatment interventions and should not\n3 be used alternatively... [I]t is a matter of general knowledge that the current excessive use\n4 of long term ‘lock down’ facilities to manage behavior problems exceed any reasonable\n5 standards for juvenile facilities.” \n6 35. Under defendant Harper, the CYA disregards wards’ due process rights in\n7 committing them to lockup units or disciplinary housing, in violation of the California\n8 Constitution, Article I, section 7 (right to due process); and the California Code of\n9 Regulations, title 15, sections 4630, 4635(a), and 4637 (procedural due process\n10 requirements for discipline and segregation).  Defendant Harper has failed to promulgate\n11 adequate procedures to permit wards to challenge their placement in lockup units.  As a\n12 result, he is operating the CYA illegally and expending taxpayer funds wastefully.  \n13 36. CYA wards are disciplined through a process called the Disciplinary\n14 Decision Making System (DDMS).  Wards subject to DDMS proceedings are often\n15 denied the opportunity to present their cases, to present witnesses in their favor or to\n16 question the witnesses testifying against them.  In some instances, hearings are not held in\n17 a timely manner and wards’ cases are heard by biased decisionmakers.  Often wards are\n18 disciplined arbitrarily, with no explanation for why the disciplinary action is being taken.\n19 37. Wards often do not receive notice of the reason for their placement in\n20 lockup.  Under CYA policy, wards can be placed in a lockup unit for up to five weeks\n21 without a hearing on the necessity for restricted housing or on the disciplinary charge.   In\n22 practice, wards often are locked up for many months at a time and up to a year without\n23 periodic review of their status.  At one facility, 21 percent of wards on temporary\n24 detention had not signed the requisite form indicating that they had received notice of\n25 why they were placed on temporary detention, how long the temporary detention was to\n26 last, and what their rights to appeal were.\n27 38.  Some wards are involuntarily housed in lockup units purportedly for their\n28\n12\n\n1 own protection without providing them with an opportunity to challenge the decision.  In\n2 other cases, the CYA actually creates the need for protective custody by knowingly\n3 transferring wards to a facility where the gang or ethnic group to which he belongs is\n4 vastly outnumbered by rival groups, rendering him unable to live safely in the general\n5 population.  \n6 39. Although CYA policy requires that administrative lockdowns (program\n7 restrictions placed on a group of wards, even entire facilities, due to safety and security\n8 concerns) last only so long as necessary to restore safety of the facility, the CYA often\n9 extends the administrative lockdown well beyond the time in which the security threat\n10 has been identified and addressed.  The CYA also places and keeps wards in lockdown\n11 based on their racial/ethnic status or purported group affiliation rather than their actual\n12 threat to safety and security, in violation of their right to equal protection of the law and\n13 freedom from impermissible discrimination based on race and ethnic status under the\n14 California Constitution, Article I, section 7.  \n15 40. Lockdown conditions parallel the harsh deprivations found in the lockup\n16 conditions described above.  However, defendant Harper has failed to take appropriate\n17 measures to mitigate the extreme hardship and severe program restrictions placed on\n18 wards on lockdowns for extended periods of time, thus ensuring that they are not\n19 provided with programs that should be available even during a period of heightened\n20 security, in violation of California law.\n21 41. Defendant Harper has long been aware of the problems with the CYA’s\n22 segregation policies and practices.  A “Standards Development Project” document dated\n23 November 9, 2000, identifies problems with education, mental health care, and recreation\n24 delivery for wards on 23/1 and other restricted programming.  A “Security Review\n25 Report” regarding lockup at the O.H. Close Youth Correctional Facility found numerous\n26 violations in August 2000, including the following: cages (“SPAs”) are used for the one-\n27 hour per day of large muscle exercise for wards; “[t]he current staffing pattern on Inyo\n28\n13\n\n1 Lockup Unit is insufficient, and stretches the existing resources to dangerous levels when\n2 problems occur”; “[t]here is no clear indication on the unit as to which wards are on\n3 suicide watch”; “ward rooms are in need of cleaning and maintenance”; wards on\n4 temporary detention are not receiving special education; some wards slept on mattresses\n5 on the floor; loose rocks and cut wood (potential weapons) littered the ground, and\n6 wards’ movement was often unmonitored (which allows for attacks by wards on other\n7 wards).  In addition, a Youth and Adult Correctional Agency investigation found in 2000\n8 that “[w]ards in isolation need adequate and appropriate large muscle exercise in an\n9 appropriate area including some time outside.  The use of caged shower areas or cages\n10 (referred to as secured program areas, or SPAs) as opposed to fenced recreation yards for\n11 large muscle exercise is inappropriate and contrary to good and accepted correctional\n12 practice.” (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, August 9-11, 2000, and\n13 September 6-8, 2000.)\n14 42. Despite his awareness over many years of these problems, defendant\n15 Harper continues to waste taxpayer money on illegal segregation policies, practices, and\n16 procedures. \n17 C.   Medical and Dental Care\n18 43. CYA wards are denied adequate medical treatment in violation of the\n19 California Constitution, Article I, sections 7 (right to due process) and 17 (no cruel or\n20 unusual punishment); Penal Code section 673 (ban on “cruel, corporal or unusual\n21 punishment” and the “inflict[ion of] any treatment or allow[ance of] any lack of care\n22 whatever which would injure or impair the health of the [ward]”); Welfare and\n23 Institutions Code section 1755.3 (medical consent); and the California Code of\n24 Regulations, title 15, sections 4611 (right to medical care on intake) and 4730 et seq.\n25 (right to medical care).  Defendant Harper has failed to establish policies and procedures\n26 adequate to protect the rights of wards in need of medical care.  He has also failed to\n27 ensure that the policies now in place are properly implemented and that properly qualified\n28\n14\n\n1 staff are hired in adequate numbers and are trained to follow them.  As a result, he has\n2 wasted and continues to waste taxpayer funds by operating a system rife with unsafe and\n3 illegal conditions of confinement. \n4 44. The CYA has insufficient numbers of qualified medical staff, including\n5 physicians, nurses and Medical Technical Assistants (MTAs).  For example, Preston\n6 Youth Correctional Facility only has one doctor, with no relief available when he is sick\n7 or on vacation.  The CYA admits this staffing is inadequate.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY\n8 2002-03.)\n9 45. Similarly, El Paso de Robles Youth Correctional Facility cannot meet the\n10 medical needs of its more than 750 wards.  The entire medical department staff informed\n11 the Superintendent on May 31, 2001, that they did not have enough nurses to fulfill\n12 “public health aspects of vaccinations and infections diseases significant to this at-risk\n13 population of teenage males.”  They further stated that “[i]t is clear that the imbalance\n14 between demands for medical and mental health care services mandated by the law, and\n15 staff responsible for responding to those demands, has reached a near alarming level at\n16 our institution.  In order to comply with the law and adhere to the agency’s policies and\n17 procedures, and to uphold the ethical standards of medical and metal health care in\n18 providing treatment and rehabilitation for the wards, our institution is in urgent need of a\n19 least one additional registered nurse, one MTA [medical technical assistant], four\n20 additional psychologists, and one full-time psychiatrist.” \n21 46. The CYA admits it does not have adequate staff to provide appropriate\n22 basic nursing care for its wards, including medication administration, daily sick call,\n23 infections disease screening and follow-up, immunizations, and urgent/emergent care. \n24 Medication is delivered by unlicensed staff, which has resulted in failure to document the\n25 administration of the medication and an inability to monitor its effectiveness.  Wards\n26 have no opportunity to ask questions about the medication and no chance to weigh the\n27 results of refusal.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)\n28\n15\n\n1 47. The medical staff that CYA does have are inadequately trained and\n2 supervised.\n3 48. Wards who require medical care are subjected to lengthy delays, including\n4 delays to see a primary physician, to obtain a referral to see a specialist, to see a specialist\n5 after obtaining the referral, to obtain medical testing, and to obtain treatment.  A pregnant\n6 ward at Ventura Youth Correctional Facility was not provided with a timely consultation\n7 with a specialist; as a result, she was not provided with adequate treatment for her urinary\n8 infection, which contributed to her subsequent premature delivery.  In addition to the\n9 physical and emotional pain and trauma suffered by the ward and her baby, hospital bills\n10 for the intensive care of the one-pound, eight-ounce baby exceeded $568,000.  \n11 49. The CYA frequently fails to provide wards with access to care altogether. \n12 For example, pregnancy care for female wards is inadequate, according to a Management\n13 Review Audit by the Office of the Inspector General in June 2002.  Often medical staff\n14 do not take sufficient steps necessary to make diagnoses.  When a diagnosis or symptom\n15 is discovered, medical staff often fail to provide treatment.  Several wards have been\n16 denied their requests to be tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, in spite\n17 of the presence of symptoms of such diseases.  \n18 50. The administration and delivery of medications is also seriously inadequate. \n19 A nurse surveyor report found numerous problems at the four-facility complex called the\n20 Northern California Youth Correctional Center (including DeWitt Nelson, Karl Holton,\n21 O.H. Close, and N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facilities) in April 2001.  The\n22 deficiencies include the following: dates in the medical file did not accurately reflect the\n23 date the medication was administered; discontinued medications were reprinted with new\n24 medication orders; expired medications, including some more than two years out of date,\n25 were being administered; drug, needle, and syringe-control records were not properly\n26 maintained, nurses poured medications without consulting the medical record and without\n27 documenting the administration; wards had refused medication dosages up to 11 times\n28\n16\n\n1 before the matter was referred to a physician; no daily glucose monitoring for diabetics;\n2 physician orders were not noted by nurses taking orders; sick call with a physician only\n3 once a week  (although the National Commission on Correctional Health Care “Standards\n4 for Health Services in Juvenile Detention and Confinement Facilities” as well as the\n5 Institute for Medical Quality standards for juvenile facilities require a minimum of five\n6 days a week for facilities with over 100 wards).  Medication policies were also deficient,\n7 in failing to address current practice and failing to cover how to report refusals of\n8 medication or treatment. \n9 51. Wards’ medical records often are disorganized and incomplete and\n10 incoming wards are not adequately screened.  As part of the survey of the Northern\n11 California Youth Correctional Center in April 2001, an outside expert reviewed the health\n12 record system at the four institutions.  The report found inadequate organization,\n13 communication, and follow-up.  The report also found that no system exists to track\n14 consents for routine or psychotropic medications at some facilities, that basic written\n15 policies are not available and not known to staff, and that files are lost when wards\n16 transfer. \n17 52. The CYA responds inadequately to wards’ emergency medical needs due to\n18 the lack of expertise of custody and medical staff and the unnecessary and inappropriate\n19 placement of custody concerns over emergency medical care.\n20 53. Defendant Harper has long been aware of serious deficiencies in the CYA’s\n21 medical care system.  In Fall 2000, a Youth and Adult Correctional Agency investigation\n22 found major problems with the CYA’s medical staffing, administration of medications to\n23 wards (including the use of nurses for “activities that by law may only be performed by a\n24 pharmacist or physician”) and involuntary medication practices that diverge from\n25 community standards  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, August 9-11,\n26 2000, and September 6-8, 2000.)  The investigation found that the CYA “lacks a\n27 systematic approach to delivering medical and mental health services to wards” and\n28\n17\n\n1 recommended significant overhauls. \n2 54. In spite of this evaluation, defendant Harper has failed to develop\n3 meaningful policy guidelines regarding the provision of medical care, including quality\n4 control procedures such as physician peer review, quality assurance and death reviews. \n5 The CYA admits that the only way to ensure that medical care policies are properly\n6 implemented is to perform local compliance inspections.  The CYA does not do so. \n7 (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)  Even when deficiencies are identified, there is\n8 inadequate follow-up to prevent future problems.  Defendant Harper has also failed to\n9 ensure that the policies now in place are properly implemented and that properly qualified\n10 staff are hired in adequate numbers and are trained to follow them.  As a result, he has\n11 wasted and continues to waste taxpayer funds by operating a system rife with unsafe and\n12 illegal conditions of confinement. \n13 D.   Mental Health Care\n14 55. Wards are denied adequate mental health treatment in violation of the\n15 California Constitution, Article I, sections 7 (right to due process) and 17 (no cruel or\n16 unusual punishment); Penal Code section 673 (ban on “cruel, corporal or unusual\n17 punishment” and the “inflict[ion of] any treatment or allow[ance of] any lack of care\n18 whatever which would injure or impair the health of the [ward]”); Welfare and\n19 Institutions Code section 1078 (mental health care training); California Code of\n20 Regulations, title 15, sections 4730 et seq. (right to medical care), 4733 (informed\n21 consent for administration of psychotropic medications), 4746 (administration of\n22 psychotropic medications), 4746.5 (voluntary psychotropic medication), and 4747\n23 (involuntary psychotropic medication). \n24 56. The CYA admits that it fails to provide minimally adequate mental health\n25 care to its wards: \n26 [T]he present configuration of mental health programs does\nnot come close to meeting the diverse mental health needs of\n27 our population.... This means that many wards will not\nreceive the mental health services required to reduce their\n28\n18\n\n1 level of danger to the community. Additionally, we will not\nbe able to successfully defend ourselves from the litigation\n2 that has been filed against us in this area. This means that the\ncourts will intercede and order us to provide costly and\n3 necessary services.\n4 (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)   The CYA further admits that it “lacks\n5 organizational structural, level of care and resources to adequately meet the mental health\n6 treatment needs of the youthful offenders.”  (Budget Change Proposal Analysis, FY\n7 2002-03.)  Other admissions in the same document include the following:\n8 • The Department does not have the professional personnel or expertise to\ntroubleshoot or resolve systemic problems related to mental health, consult\n9 on difficult cases or centrally distribute clinical information to mental\nhealth professionals.  These factors impact continuity of patient care and\n10 successful transition between programs, and from the institution setting to\nparole. \n11\n• Many of the deficiencies that the Federal Government discovered in these\n12 other states [successfully sued over the past seven years for unconstitutional\nconditions] also exist in California.  As with the states discussed above, the\n13 [CYA] does not currently have an organized and integrated delivery system\nof mental health services.  Until these deficiencies are addressed, the\n14 Department is at risk of future litigation with the Federal Government. \n15 • Currently there is no effective central coordination of statewide\ndepartmental mental health services.  Planning has been reactive, piecemeal\n16 and fragmented.... There is no oversight to assure consistent treatment and\nappropriate patient care follow-up.  This impacts continuity of patient care,\n17 successful transition between programs and transition from the institutional\nsetting to parole.\n18\n57. A study by Stanford University psychiatrists found the CYA’s\n19\n“organizational culture not conducive to mental health treatment” and discovered “a lack\n20\nin continuity of care” for wards.  (Steiner, Humphreys & Redlich, The Assessment of the\n21\nMental Health System of the California Youth Authority, December 31, 2001.)\n22\n58. The CYA admits it is “understaffed by all national standards.”  (Budget\n23\nChange Proposal Analysis, FY 2002-03.)  The appropriate ratio of psychologists to\n24\nwards, by the CYA’s own estimates, is 1:60.  (Id.)  The CYA operates with a ratio of\n25\n1:288.  (Id.)  That means the CYA needs an additional 71.5 psychologist positions.  In\n26\naddition, the CYA requires an additional 18.6 psychiatrist positions to bring it to the\n27\nnational standard of 1:200.  (Id.)  As discussed above in the section on medical care, the\n28\n19\n\n1 CYA also admits it does not have adequate staff to provide appropriate basic nursing care\n2 for its wards, including delivery of medications, and admits that the only way to ensure\n3 that medical care policies are properly implemented is to perform local compliance\n4 inspections, which the CYA does not do.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)  The\n5 Stanford study found that all CYA institutions were understaffed and that “external\n6 forces... cause staff to use their time ineffectively.”  (Steiner, Humphreys & Redlich, The\n7 Assessment of the Mental Health System of the California Youth Authority, December\n8 31, 2001.)\n9 59. For example, El Paso de Robles Youth Correctional Facility cannot meet\n10 the mental health needs of its more than 750 wards.  The entire medical department staff\n11 informed the facility’s Superintendent on May 31, 2001, that it has “definite deficiencies”\n12 in the mental health care delivery process, due largely to a “virtually intolerable”\n13 workload.  There is only one full-time psychologist and one part-time contract\n14 psychiatrist (40 hours per month) to serve the needs of more than 750 wards, of whom 91\n15 have histories of suicide attempts and more than 200 are on the waiting list of\n16 psychological evaluations and/or psychotherapy.  The CYA has admitted similar\n17 deficiencies at the Wintu ITP at the Northern Youth Correctional Reception Center and\n18 Clinic and at the N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility.  (Budget Concept Papers,\n19 FY 2002-03.)\n20 60. In addition, due to its inadequate staffing the CYA cannot meet its\n21 obligation to provide evaluations for those wards the Youthful Offender Parole Board\n22 (YOPB) seeks to retain in custody following their original discharge date.  If the YOPB\n23 determines that a ward would be dangerous to the public due to a “mental or physical\n24 deficiency, disorder, or abnormality,” it may seek to retain the ward for an additional two\n25 years by requesting the prosecutor to petition the court for such an order.  Welf. & Inst. §\n26 1800.  Mental health evaluations prepared by CYA staff are essential to this process. \n27 However, they are often improperly and inadequately prepared, often presenting\n28\n20\n\n1 inaccurate information and based on a lack of knowledge on the part of staff generating\n2 the report.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2000-01; Budget Change Proposal Analysis, FY\n3 2002-03.)  Reports are also often late, which the CYA admits can and does “result in the\n4 premature release of an offender clinically assessed as mentally ill and recognized by\n5 staff as dangerous to the public safety.”  (Budget Change Proposal Analysis, FY 2002-\n6 03.) \n7 61. The CYA has an inadequate number of treatment beds.  According to the\n8 CYA’s own analysis, there are only 523 mental health beds available to serve a\n9 population of at least 3,173 wards requiring treatment.  (Budget Change Proposal\n10 Analysis, FY 2002-03.)  In the last fiscal year, the CYA’s budget was reduced by $4.5\n11 million, which had been appropriated for expansion of substance abuse, sex offender\n12 specialized counseling, and mental health resources programs.  \n13 62. Medical records are disorganized and incomplete and mental health\n14 assessment is inadequate.  For example, female wards at Ventura Youth Correctional\n15 Facility do not receive timely mental health assessments.  (Office of the Inspector\n16 General, Management Review Audit, Ventura Youth Correctional Facility, June 2002.) \n17 CYA staff inappropriately rely on an unreliable screening tool to determine the required\n18 level of care.  In addition, CYA staff do not clearly identify and flag files for wards who\n19 have suicide histories.  Documentation regarding suicide risks is inadequately maintained\n20 in the files and Suicide Risk Lists are improperly maintained.  (Report to the Director on\n21 Compliance with the Suicide Prevention Assessment and Response Policy, November 1,\n22 2001.)\n23 63. Administration of medication is so inadequate as to be dangerous to wards. \n24 The nurse surveyor report regarding conditions at the Northern California Youth\n25 Correctional Center found numerous deficiencies described above in the section on\n26 medical care that apply as well to administration of psychiatric medications.  In addition,\n27 the report found that court-ordered psychiatric medications were not administered.  The\n28\n21\n\n1 Stanford study found that “modern psychopharmacology” is not practiced in the CYA.  It\n2 is impossible for the CYA to monitor administration and effectiveness of psychotropic\n3 medications with a dearth of mental health professionals.  \n4 64. Wards who are suicidal or self-mutilating do not receive adequate care or\n5 treatment.  At least one ward has successfully committed suicide as a result of inadequate\n6 care.  Wards who are placed on suicide watch are not properly monitored and they do not\n7 receive sufficient clinical intervention.  (Report to the Director on Compliance with the\n8 Suicide Prevention Assessment and Response Policy, November 1, 2001.)  Instead of\n9 direct physical observation, wards are inappropriately placed in “camera rooms,” where\n10 their activities are intermittently monitored by video.  These “camera rooms” are often\n11 filthy and unsafe; they have not been modified to eliminate fixtures that could be used by\n12 a ward to commit suicide.  CYA policies inappropriately permit wards to be retained in\n13 “camera rooms” for three days regardless of their mental condition, thereby imposing\n14 punishment on wards for seeking mental health services.  Ward Darren Striplin has been\n15 diagnosed with severe depression, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder and\n16 is taking several medications for these conditions.  Nevertheless, when Darren has been\n17 on suicide watch at Chaderjian, his visits with the psychiatrists rarely last longer than\n18 about five minutes and he is not provided with counseling or any other treatment.\n19 65. Wards who attempt suicide are often punished by being restricted to their\n20 rooms for a set number of days.  Enforced isolation is dangerous and unnecessarily\n21 punitive.  The CYA chaplain’s group told Mr. Harper in October 2001 (quoted above in\n22 the section on Segregation) that the practice of holding wards in isolation for excessive\n23 amounts of time caused them concerns for wards’ mental health, particularly for those\n24 wards who are already suicidal.  \n25 66. Suicidal wards also receive mental health care while locked in cages.  As\n26 quoted above in the section on Segregation, a pastoral delegation to Fred C. Nelles Youth\n27 Correctional Facility informed Mr. Harper on November 27, 2001, that they found the\n28\n22\n\n1 cages, or SPAs, inhumane and were shocked at the sight of a suicidal ward receiving\n2 counseling from a cage, with the psychologist halfway across the room.  \n3 67. Staff are not adequately trained on the use of cut-down tools (to rescue\n4 wards who attempt to hang themselves), and the tools’ location is not standardized. \n5 (Report to the Director on Compliance with the Suicide Prevention Assessment and\n6 Response Policy, November 1, 2001.)  As an internal CYA report informed defendant\n7 Harper a year ago, this means that new staff might not be able to find the tools, and the\n8 delay could be fatal.  \n9 68. Many wards have been involuntarily medicated with psychotropic drugs for\n10 behavior problems and without sufficient clinical justification.  Involuntary medication\n11 often is administered without a hearing and, if the ward is a minor, without the consent of\n12 the parent or guardian.  The nurse surveyor report regarding conditions at the four-facility\n13 Northern California Youth Correctional Center found that psychotropic medications are\n14 administered without signed consents.  Ward Edward Jermaine Brown was subjected to\n15 inappropriate forced medication that was administered without appropriate review by\n16 clinical staff.  He was coerced into taking psychotropic medication by threats of longer\n17 periods of solitary confinement.  Although Jermaine was a minor, he was given\n18 psychotropic medication without the consent of a parent or guardian, even though CYA\n19 clinical staff have acknowledged that such consent is required. \n20 69. Defendant Harper has long known of the inadequacies of the CYA’s mental\n21 health care delivery system.  A CYA Mental Health Strategic Plan Committee met in\n22 March 2000 and acknowledged that “[t]he current array of treatment programs do not\n23 meet the mental health needs of a significant portion of the YA population.”  In February\n24 2001, the Chief of the Health Care Services Division wrote to Mr. Harper stating that\n25 CYA does not have enough psychologists or psychiatrists.  He reported that 70 additional\n26 psychology positions must be filled to bring the CYA up to national standards; the\n27 request for such funding had been denied for two years, and the request for 24 additional\n28\n23\n\n1 psychiatrists had been denied as well. \n2 70. Despite his awareness of these systemic problems, defendant Harper has\n3 failed to develop meaningful policy guidelines regarding the provision of mental health\n4 care, including quality control procedures such as physician peer review, quality\n5 assurance and death reviews.  Even if deficiencies are identified, there is inadequate\n6 follow-up to prevent future problems.  Defendant Harper has also failed to ensure that the\n7 policies now in place are properly implemented and that properly qualified staff are hired\n8 in adequate numbers and are trained to follow them.  As a result, he has wasted and\n9 continues to waste taxpayer funds by operating a system rife with unsafe and illegal\n10 conditions of confinement.  The failure to treat mentally ill wards is dangerous to them\n11 and to all Californians.  According to staff at the Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional\n12 Facility, “many of our most dangerous and dysfunctional wards are simply released back\n13 into the community when they reach their maximum confinement, having received little\n14 to no psychological services.”  The “most dangerous remain isolated... and become more\n15 and more dysfunctional due to the lack of healthy interpersonal contact.”  (Budget\n16 Concept Paper, FY 2002-03.)\n17 E.   Programming/Rehabilitation\n18 71. Under defendant Harper, the CYA does not provide wards with the general\n19 treatment, programming, and rehabilitation to which they are entitled under California\n20 law.   See, e.g.,Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 736 (CYA shall only accept a ward “if it has\n21 adequate facilities to provide... care”), 1004 (CYA must “provide for [wards’] care,\n22 supervision, education, training, [and] employment... and promotion of their welfare), and\n23 1700 (CYA must substitute “offender training and treatment” for “retributive\n24 punishment”).  \n25 (a) Education\n26 72. Wards do not receive adequate access to education.  This is a violation of\n27 the California Constitution.  Serrano v. Priest (1977) 18 Cal.3d 728, 765 (right to\n28\n24\n\n1 education).  See also Ed. Code §§ 46141 (minimum daily instruction time), 56000 et seq.\n2 (special education requirements); and Welf. & Inst. Code § 1120 et seq. (right to\n3 education for CYA wards).  \n4 73. For years, the CYA administration has been aware of chronic, serious\n5 problems with the education system and has not corrected those problems.  Wards\n6 typically receive only a fraction of the educational program to which they are entitled, the\n7 work they receive does not track their high school graduation plan, and they often are not\n8 given credit for work completed while in segregation.  Wards are required to have a high\n9 school graduation plan, but the CYA’s educational services often fail to match what\n10 wards need to graduate from high school.  \n11 74. California Education Code section 46141 requires 240 minutes of education\n12 per student per day.  The CYA does not provide students with this statutory requirement. \n13 For example, in fiscal year 2000-01, wards at Ventura Youth Correctional Facility\n14 received “only 54% of their assigned educational programming” and an average of 644\n15 classes were cancelled each month.  (Office of the Inspector General, Management\n16 Review Audit, Ventura Youth Correctional Facility, June 2002.)  Paso Robles wards who\n17 participate in the substance abuse program are prohibited from going to school.  Wards in\n18 school at O.H. Close Youth Correctional Facility were held back from school to act as\n19 janitors on their living units.  The enrollment rate at DeWitt Nelson High School in 2000\n20 was only 89 percent. \n21 75. There are several reasons for this failure to meet state educational\n22 requirements.  First, the CYA does not have enough teachers.  A CYA teachers’ group\n23 stated in 2002 that “the problem of under-staffing, insufficient training, and lack of\n24 adequate classroom space still exists as it did in 1990,” when the CYA was successfully\n25 sued over its failure to provide the statutorily required special education to wards. \n26 (Committee of Concerned Educators of Northern California Youth Authority and the\n27 California State Employee Association - SEIU Local 1000, The Matthews Report, p. 7.) \n28\n25\n\n1 The report continued, “[c]lasses are closed due to chronic under-staffing,” among other\n2 reasons, and “[m]inutes of direct instruction in appropriate classroom settings have\n3 decreased, due to the department’s insistence on forcing their faculty out onto crowded,\n4 dangerous living units each day to pass packets of materials through cracks in cell doors.” \n5 Despite serious staffing shortages, the CYA took steps in March 2002 to lay off 91\n6 temporary and part-time staff, 40 of whom provided special education services.  \n7 76. Second, substitute teachers are either nonexistent or present in such\n8 inadequate numbers that classes are often simply cancelled when the regular teacher is\n9 unavailable.   \n10 77. Third, students on temporary detention, lockup and Special Management\n11 Units are denied the educational services required by law.  For example, the federal\n12 Department of Education found in 2002 that non-English-speaking wards in the CYA are\n13 often not provided with educational services during lockdown.  (Letter from Director\n14 Stefan Rosenzweig to CYA Superintendent, Education Services Branch, of February 1,\n15 2002.)  Wards on “restricted program” or segregation do not get their legally mandated\n16 special education services.  (California Department of Education Compliance Report # I-\n17 1079-00/01, September 14, 2001.)\n18 78. Not only does the CYA fail to provide students with the quantity of general\n19 educational services required by law, the CYA does not provide statutorily prescribed\n20 special education services, such as tutors or special education classes.  Wards with\n21 disabilities are not tested, they are not provided with necessary behavior assessments and\n22 support, and the CYA does not have adequate educational psychologists to provide\n23 necessary services.  Conversely, some wards receive schoolwork that is not challenging,\n24 is redundant and is inappropriate for their skill level.  \n25 79. Approximately 34 percent of CYA’s high school population, or 1,700\n26 wards, receive special education.  (California Department of Education Compliance\n27 Report # I-1079-00/01, September 14, 2001.)  These students do not receive all of their\n28\n26\n\n1 required Individual Education Plan (IEP) services, however, in large part because special\n2 education is even more severely understaffed than regular education programming.  For\n3 example, in June 2002, wards were provided with only 208 hours of Special Day Classes\n4 at Dewitt Nelson High School, although their IEPs called for 350; at N.A. Chaderjian,\n5 only 1,249 hours of Special Day Classes were provided, despite wards’ need for 1,412; at\n6 Johanna Boss High School, only 3,556 hours were provided, despite wards’ need for\n7 4,183; at Marie C. Romero High School, only 1,472 hours were provided, despite wards’\n8 need for 2,439; at Mary B. Perry High School, only 968 hours were provided, despite\n9 wards’ need for 1,148; at Lyle Egan High School, only 1,937 hours were provided,\n10 despite wards’ need for 2,235.  In sum, in just one month, wards at these CYA high\n11 schools were not provided with thousands of hours of special education classes required\n12 by their IEPs.  As discussed above in the section on Segregation, wards on restricted\n13 programming are regularly denied required special education services.\n14 80. Wards are frequently required, as a condition for parole, to obtain a General\n15 Education Degree (GED) and/or high school diploma.  Wards who are prevented from\n16 meeting these goals due to lack of educational opportunities have decreased chances of\n17 being released on parole, and may have to “max out” their time at CYA, receiving a\n18 dishonorable discharge. \n19 81. The federal Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) found\n20 extensive deficiencies in the CYA’s educational system for non-English speaking wards\n21 in 2002.2  The OCR “considers these problems to be major and of serious concern.” \n22 (Letter from Director Stefan Rosenzweig to CYA Superintendent, Education Services\n23 Branch, of February 1, 2002.)  As a general matter, the CYA “is not providing the\n24 instruction and services called for in its plan to teach students English and provide them\n25\n26\n2The CYA estimates that 13-14 percent of its non-graduate students are limited\n27\nEnglish proficiency.  (Letter from Director Stefan Rosenzweig to CYA Superintendent of\nEducation, December 30, 1999.)\n28\n27\n\n1 an equal opportunity to access the core curriculum.”  Other deficiencies include the\n2 following: the CYA “does not have an adequate system for ensuring that the program for\n3 [English learner] students is fully and appropriately implemented at all sites”; the CYA\n4 “has no ability to collect, access, track and review system-wide data” on these students; at\n5 many schools, staff do not place English learners in the appropriate classes; and most\n6 CYA teachers who teach English learners “do not have the certification or training\n7 necessary to meet the needs of those students,” in part because the CYA does not keep\n8 accurate records of such certification and training.  Many of these problems were also\n9 found in the federal Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights compliance\n10 review of the CYA in 1999.  (Letter from Director Stefan Rosenzweig to CYA\n11 Superintendent of Education, December 30, 1999.)  Defendant Harper has been aware of\n12 these deficiencies for years and has not resolved them.  \n13   (b) Substance abuse treatment\n14 82. Substance abuse treatment in the CYA is inadequate.  Three quarters of all\n15 wards committed to the CYA have histories of drug use and 60 percent (approximately\n16 3,600 of the CYA’s population of 6,000) have been identified as serious substance\n17 abusers.  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)   However, the CYA does not have\n18 adequate numbers of substance abuse treatment beds.  As of April 2002, there are\n19 approximately 998 “formal” treatment beds, with 889 wards on the waiting list, and 670\n20 “informal” treatment beds, with 465 wards on the waiting list.  “Informal” treatment is\n21 defined to include programs that offer as little as eight hours of treatment over a three-\n22 week period.  (Id.)  \n23 83. Moreover, the substance abuse programs themselves are deficient.  Staff\n24 running the programs have little specific training and supervision, and treatment is\n25 provided only sporadically for wards on lockup or lockdown.  \n26 84. The failure to provide adequate or appropriate substance abuse treatment to\n27 wards is costly to taxpayers: 40 percent of technical parole revocations of wards “had a\n28\n28\n\n1 primary violation offense related to drugs.  The cost of returning one of these wards to the\n2 institution for a year is approximately $43,700.”  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)\n3 (c) Sex offender treatment\n4 85. The CYA does not provide adequate treatment for convicted sex offenders. \n5 The CYA admits it has an inadequate number of treatment beds for sex offenders and it\n6 does not and cannot comply with Welfare and Institutions Code section 727.6, which\n7 requires sex offender treatment for wards committed for sexually violent offenses. \n8 (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2003-04.)  As of April 2002, there are 783 wards in need of\n9 sex offender treatment incarcerated in the CYA and only 169 specialized treatment beds. \n10 There are an additional 137 “informal” sex offender treatment slots, but there programs\n11 are inadequate and ineffective, provided by untrained staff.  \n12 86. This has been a chronic problem in the CYA: as of March 2001, there were\n13 1,102 identified sex offenders in CYA institutions, but only 312 in treatment beds. \n14 (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2002-03.)  As of December 1999, there were 1,052 sex\n15 offenders and only 259 placed in treatment beds.  (Id.)  \n16 87. As a result, the majority of sex offenders committed to the CYA are housed\n17 in general population with no treatment at all.  The CYA admits that “many of these\n18 wards are released to the community without appropriate treatment interventions and\n19 aftercare resources and are at greater risk of re-offending.”  (Budget Concept Paper, FY\n20 2002-03).  \n21 88. In addition, sex offenders who cannot attend sex-offender programs ordered\n22 by the Youthful Offender Parole Board due to lack of availability spend a longer time\n23 incarcerated due to the CYA’s inadequacies, which harms them and wastes taxpayer\n24 money.  \n25 (d) Exercise\n26 89. Defendant Harper has failed to develop and implement policies and\n27 procedures to ensure that wards under the CYA’s care receive adequate opportunities to\n28\n29\n\n1 exercise.  As a result, the CYA does not provide adequate exercise programs to wards. \n2 Wards are regularly forced to miss exercise programs if they attend school or church, or\n3 even if they shower.  Wards on lockup or lockdown status frequently have no access to\n4 exercise at all: the one hour per day they are allowed to spend outside their rooms is\n5 typically spent in dog-kennel-type cages.\n6 (e) Physical Facilities\n7 90. CYA’s inadequate physical facilities create a punitive environment for\n8 wards and render CYA’s statutory duty of rehabilitation impossible.  In many housing\n9 units, there are broken windows, dirty vents, leaky roofs, cracked floor tiles, and\n10 inadequate plumbing.  Wards often must endure extreme temperatures.  Often the water is\n11 turned off in wards’ cells for up to four hours at a time, leaving them unable to flush the\n12 toilet or to wash themselves.  Many of the cells are filthy, particularly rooms in lockup\n13 units or suicide-watch rooms, where dried mucus, blood and/or feces on the walls is\n14 commonplace.  The CYA has failed to develop and implement the necessary policies and\n15 procedures to ensure that its physical facilities are adequately maintained.  \n16 91. In at least one CYA facility, an independent state inspector found that\n17 maintenance was deficient and that with problems such as leaky roofs, holes in ceilings,\n18 broken windows, and leaky pipes that had flooded a sidewalk area, the facility had\n19 “deteriorated to an unacceptable level.” \n20 92. Due to state budget cuts, the CYA is currently operating with a $2 million\n21 reduction in minor capital outlay funds, which are used to repair, upgrade, and enhance\n22 its facilities.  Additionally, the CYA is being directed to make significant additional\n23 reductions in current year operating costs, and is planning to reduce special repair and\n24 deferred maintenance funds to meet this goal.  \n25 93. There are serious infirmities in the physical facilities used for mental health\n26 diagnosis and treatment, including ward intake at reception centers and suicide watch\n27 facilities.  \n28\n30\n\n1 (f) Religion\n2 94. CYA wards are not provided with reasonable access to opportunities to\n3 exercise religion in violation of the California Constitution, Article I, section 4 (freedom\n4 of religion) and Welfare and Institutions Code section 1705 (freedom of religion for CYA\n5 wards).  Defendant Harper admitted to systemic problems with wards’ ability to access\n6 religious programs in a Memorandum to the Secretary of the Youth and Adult\n7 Correctional Agency dated July 10, 2001. \n8 95. Four months after Mr. Harper wrote to the Secretary of YACA to describe\n9 systemic problems with the CYA’s delivery of religious services, the problems remained. \n10 A pastoral delegation to Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facilities found that wards are\n11 often excluded from religious services as punishment.  The CYA chaplains’ group\n12 expressed concerns that “staff restricts the numbers of wards who can attend church\n13 services in a manner that is arbitrary and lacks anything to do with discipline or security\n14 issues.”  (Memorandum from DaaiyAllah H. Fardam, President of the Youth Authority\n15 Chaplains, to Mr. Harper, October 19, 2001.) \n16 96. Wards at Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility in “lower phases”\n17 (who are entitled to fewer privileges) are often precluded from any access to religious\n18 services or programs.  Other lower-phase wards in the CYA must often choose between\n19 dayroom programming or religious programming. \n20 F.   Access to Courts & Redress of Grievances \n21 97. The CYA fails to provide wards with an adequate grievance system. \n22 Defendant Harper, as head of the CYA, is required to “establish and maintain a fair,\n23 simple, and expeditious system for resolution of grievances of all persons committed to\n24 the Youth Authority.”  Welf. & Inst. Code § 1766.5.  In fact, the CYA’s grievance system\n25 is ineffectual and unfair.  \n26 98. Although both California law and CYA rules set forth a number of\n27 requirements for the grievance system, in practice these requirements are frequently\n28\n31\n\n1 disregarded by CYA staff.  See Welf. & Inst. Code § 1766.5; Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 15,\n2 § 4085 et seq.  The result is that the CYA grievance system does not afford wards a fair\n3 opportunity to pursue administrative remedies against CYA.  Because exhaustion of\n4 administrative remedies is a requirement for wards who bring lawsuits against the CYA,\n5 the lack of a legitimate grievance system effectively prohibits wards’ access to the courts\n6 in violation of the California Constitution, Article I, section 3 (freedom of association,\n7 right to petition for redress of grievances).  \n8 99. Wards have been denied the opportunity even to complete a grievance form. \n9 Even when wards are permitted to submit grievances, they are largely ignored.  Worse\n10 yet, wards are often retaliated against for filing grievances about CYA staff members,\n11 even though under California law, “[t]he system should provide for safeguards against\n12 reprisals against any grievant.”  (Welf. & Inst. Code § 1766.5.) \n13 100. Ward Michael Resendiz attempted to file a grievance for excessive use of\n14 force by staff members at Southern Youth Correctional Reception Center and Clinic. \n15 Staff refused to provide him with a grievance form.  Three staff members came to\n16 Michael shortly thereafter and promised to alter a behavior report written on him if he\n17 refrained from filing a grievance against staff.  Because Michael feared being sent back to\n18 court or receiving a time add (an additional period of incarceration) due to his\n19 participation in the fight, he went along with their scheme and declined to file a\n20 grievance.\n21 101. Ward Claudia Medina was given a “Level B” write up at Ventura Youth\n22 Correctional Facility for attempting to provide an attorney with a blank grievance form.  \n23 102. Wards are also punished for filing “too many” grievances and are dissuaded\n24 from doing so with the threat of a disciplinary write up. \n25 103. The Office of the Inspector General has found serious deficiencies in the\n26 CYA grievance system.  For example, the Inspector General found that “the quality and\n27 completeness of the investigations conducted by the [Stark Youth Correctional Facility]\n28\n32\n\n1 and by California Youth Authority’s Internal Affairs Unit is suspect.  There is evidence to\n2 suggest that the management of the California Youth Authority may have failed to act\n3 properly on some of the investigative results.” At Preston Youth Correctional Facility, the\n4 Inspector General found that “[t]he superintendent’s performance is significantly out of\n5 compliance with laws, regulations, or departmental policy, and immediate attention is\n6 required to remedy the situation.”  An audit of Nelles Youth Correctional Facility\n7 uncovered the fact that not all cases are fully investigated and that grievances are not\n8 resolved in a timely manner: 50 percent of the grievances submitted in the four years\n9 preceding the audit had not been resolved, and that some of the unresolved grievances\n10 were “potentially serious.” Additionally, the Inspector General found that grievances\n11 against CYA staff are not investigated in a timely manner, a problem of particular\n12 concern in light of the one-year deadline for taking administrative action against\n13 employees.  The Nelles audit reflected concern that grievance documents are frequently\n14 lost, going so far as to state, “[t]he absence of a system to ensure accountability,\n15 combined with evidence that grievances are in fact lost, raises the specter of possible staff\n16 abuse, such as staff simply throwing away ward grievances.”  \n17 104. In a similarly damning report, the San Luis Obispo Grand Jury found that\n18 wards at the lockup unit at El Paso de Robles Youth Correctional Facility “had no\n19 grievance log and no grievance clerk, and there was little evidence that any wards had\n20 initiated written grievances while there.”  The Grand Jury found that “the grievance\n21 procedure there has been emphatically disallowed by those in charge of the system.” \n22 Wards informed Grand Jury members that they did not file grievances because they\n23 feared retaliation.  The grievances clerks in other housing units lacked “adequate\n24 knowledge of the grievance procedure to assure full access by the wards they are selected\n25 to serve.”\n26 105. An investigation by the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency found that\n27 “due to inattention over the years and failure to monitor efficacy, the grievance system is\n28\n33\n\n1 inconsistently applied and ineffective.”  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance\n2 Project, August 9-11, 2000, and September 6-8, 2000.)  \n3 106. In addition to his failure to provide wards with an adequate grievance\n4 procedure, defendant Harper fails to provide the law library access and access to the\n5 courts required by state law.  Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 15, §§ 4131 (access to courts), 4132\n6 (right to be informed of new court decisions), and 4701 (law library requirements). \n7 Wards in the CYA are frequently denied access to the law library, or are permitted to use\n8 it for an insufficient period of time.  An outside arbitrator has concluded that “[i]t seems\n9 quite clear that [Northern Youth Correctional Reception Center and Clinic’s] library is\n10 not operating properly.”\n11 G.   Disability Discrimination\n12 107. Wards in CYA face discrimination based on physical, sensory,\n13 developmental, cognitive, mental, and learning disabilities, in violation of Government\n14 Code sections 4450 and 11135 and Education Code sections 56000 et seq.  Wards with\n15 disabilities are denied access to CYA facilities, programs, services, and activities due to\n16 their disabilities and face harassment and humiliation based on their disabilities.  The\n17 CYA has failed to develop adequate policies or procedures to ensure equal access to\n18 programs, services, and activities and freedom from disability harassment. \n19 108. The CYA admits that it violates the rights of wards with cognitive\n20 disabilities: \n21 [T]he Department does not operate special programs for individuals with\ncognitive and intellectual impairments.  Those that are cognitively or\n22 intellectually impaired have difficulty adjusting to crowded dormitory\nsituations where noise levels are higher and sources of behavioral stimuli\n23 are less controlled.  More socially skilled and manipulative peers frequently\ntarget them for exploitation.  In the absence of adequate frustration\n24 management and verbal skills, they have a tendency to engage in aggressive\nbehaviors, are often considered parole ineligible, and spend longer periods\n25 in detention than their more intellectually and socially competent peers. \nEstablishment of behaviorally oriented treatment with a system of rewards\n26 for accomplishments and successive approximations can be very effective\nin working with intellectually impaired offenders.  Such programs require\n27 clinical supervision by trained mental health professionals.  At this time,\nIntensive Treatment Programs are not staffed or trained to effectively treat\n28\n34\n\n1 and manage this population.  A reduction in program beds with a\ncorresponding increase in staff/ward ratio will allow Intensive Treatment\n2 Programs to “specialize” to meet the needs of unserved or underserved\nmental health populations such as cognitively/intellectually impaired wards\n3 and those requiring intensive psychiatric services.   \n4 (Budget Change Proposal Analysis, Fiscal Year 2002-03.)  The CYA further admits that\n5 “[d]evelopmentally disabled and cognitively impaired offenders are among those for\n6 whom treatment services are inadequate.”  (Budget Concept Paper, FY 2000-01.)\n7 109. In addition, wards with learning and other cognitive disabilities are not able\n8 to participate in counseling groups or programs where the reading material is too difficult\n9 for them.  The inability to participate in such programs can and often does prevent these\n10 wards from obtaining a higher “phase” classification and from making progress towards\n11 their parole requirements.  The CYA fails to provide learning disabled wards with the\n12 necessary access to special educational programming, thereby impeding their academic\n13 progress and often their chances of parole in violation of Education Code sections 56026\n14 and 56340.  \n15 110. The CYA does not have a sufficient number of special education teachers\n16 and tutors to assist wards with learning disabilities.  Wards who show signs of learning\n17 disabilities often are not tested and are refused special assistance from their teachers.  The\n18 Youth and Adult Correctional Agency’s investigatory team found in 2000 that the CYA\n19 does not meet the statutory requirements for Individual Education Plans: facilities were\n20 not completing meaningful IEPs on time, and the resources to implement them were not\n21 always available.  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, August 9-11,\n22 2000, and September 6-8, 2000.)  The California Department of Education made similar\n23 findings in 2001 with regard to wards held in segregation.  (California Department of\n24 Education Compliance Report # I-1079-00/01, September 14, 2001.)\n25 111. Wards with physical and sensory disabilities, including deaf wards, are not\n26 provided with readily accessible physical facilities and with reasonable modifications\n27 necessary to allow them to participate in CYA programs, services, and activities.  Deaf\n28\n35\n\n1 and hard of hearing wards are not provided with equally effective communication and\n2 equal access to ward privileges such as telephone use.  The Youth and Adult Correctional\n3 Agency’s investigatory team found that “[s]taff members who deal with disabled wards\n4 are untrained in the requirements of the ADA and appropriate accommodations for those\n5 wards.  Hearing-impaired wards, for example, were not provided a translator for a\n6 significant program activity.  The Team also observed that disabled wards were housed in\n7 other special treatment units, with accommodations either missing or provided\n8 inconsistently.”  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, August 9-11, 2000,\n9 and September 6-8, 2000.) \n10 112. Wards who are disabled due to mental illness also face discrimination\n11 within the CYA system.  Through measures such as forced and inappropriate medication,\n12 unnecessary confinement to suicide watches and camera rooms, inadequate therapy, and\n13 placement on lockup facilities (Special Management Units) due to their mental illness, the\n14 CYA deprives these wards of access to CYA programs, services, and activities equivalent\n15 to what is available for non-disabled wards.  \n16 H.   Sex Discrimination\n17 113. Female wards in the CYA are denied equal access to education: far fewer\n18 college level courses are offered to female wards than to male wards. As a result it takes\n19 much longer for female wards to obtain college degrees.  The Youth and Adult\n20 Correctional Agency found that there is “a critical lack of vocational education\n21 opportunities for female wards,” and remarked that they are not equivalent to those\n22 offered male wards.  (Institutions Operational Quality Assurance Project, August 9-11,\n23 2000, and September 6-8, 2000.)  This unequal access violates the equal protection\n24 guarantees of the California Constitution.  See Cal. Const., art. I, sections 7 (equal\n25 protection clause), 8 (a person may not be disqualified from entering or pursing a\n26 business, profession, vocation or employment because of sex) and 31(a) (no\n27 discrimination or preferential treatment on the basis of sex); and Education Code section\n28\n36\n\n1 221.5 (nondiscrimination in vocational and educational opportunities).  \n2 CAUSE OF ACTION \n3 114. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference herein all of the allegations\n4 contained in paragraphs 1 through 113, inclusive, as though they were fully set forth\n5 herein.\n6 115. Defendant has expended tax moneys and threatens to and will continue to\n7 expend tax moneys as alleged herein in violation of state law, including but not limited to\n8 the following:\n9 • the CYA’s excessive use of force against wards and failure to protect wards from\n10 known risk of violence from other wards violates the California Constitution, art. I,\n11 §§ 1 (right to enjoy life, liberty, and safety), 7 (right to due process), and 17 (no\n12 cruel or unusual punishment); Penal Code §§ 147 (willful inhumanity or\n13 oppression toward prisoners), 149 (unnecessary assaults by peace officers), and\n14 673 (ban on “cruel, corporal or unusual punishment” and the “inflict[ion of] any\n15 treatment or allow[ance of] any lack of care whatever which would injure or\n16 impair the health of the [ward]”); and Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 15, §§ 4039 and\n17 4040 (restrictions on use of force and chemical and mechanical restraints).  \n18 • the CYA’s policies and practices on segregation, including lockup and lockdown\n19 of wards, violate the California Constitution, art. I, §§ 1 (right to enjoy life,\n20 liberty, and safety), 4 (freedom of religion), 7 (right to due process and to equal\n21 protection of the law), 10 (right to education), and 17 (no cruel or unusual\n22 punishment); Penal Code § 673 (ban on “cruel, corporal or unusual punishment”\n23 and the “inflict[ion of] any treatment or allow[ance of] any lack of care whatever\n24 which would injure or impair the health of the [ward]”); Welf. & Inst.

I, §§\n5 7 (right to due process) and 17 (no cruel or unusual punishment); Penal Code §\n6 673 (ban on “cruel, corporal or unusual punishment” and the “inflict[ion of] any\n7 treatment or allow[ance of] any lack of care whatever which would injure or\n8 impair the health of the [ward]”); Welf. & Inst. Code § 1755.3 (medical consent);\n9 and Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 15, §§ 4611 (right to medical care on intake) and 4730\n10 et seq. (right to medical care).  \n11 • the CYA’s inadequate mental health care violates the California Constitution, art.\n12 I, §§ 7 (right to due process) and 17 (no cruel or unusual punishment); Penal Code\n13 § 673 (ban on “cruel, corporal or unusual punishment” and the “inflict[ion of] any\n14 treatment or allow[ance of] any lack of care whatever which would injure or\n15 impair the health of the [ward]”); Welf. & Inst.

I, §§ 1 (right to enjoy life, liberty, and safety), 4\n24 (freedom of religion), 7 (due process clause), and generally (Serrano v. Priest\n25 (1977) 18 Cal.3d 728, 765 (right to education)); Ed.

Allen  by  the \nplaintiff,  Margaret  Farrell,  a  taxpayer  in  the  State  of California,  and  the  defendant  Walter  Allen \nIII,  Director  of the  California  Youth  Authority,  now  the  Division  of Juvenile  Justice  (“DJJ”), \nCalifornia  Department  of  Corrections  and  Rehabilitation  (“CDCR”).  The  Consent  Decree \nrequired  the  defendant  to  file  remedial  plans  in  all  areas  of deficiency  identified  by  experts  for \nthe court  by  January  31,  2005.  In  January  2005,  based  on  DJJ’s  decision  to  reform  California’s \njuvenile  system  to  a  rehabilitative  model  based  on  a  therapeutic  environment  rather  than  simply \naddress  the  deficiencies  identified  by  the  expert  reports,  the  parties  stipulated  to  extend  the  dates \nfor  the  filing  of remedial  plans. \nPursuant  to  the  agreed  upon  time  extension,  DJJ  filed  its  proposed  Safety  and  Welfare  Remedial \nPlan  on  December  1,  2005.  Both  parties  agreed  that  the  plan  submitted  by  DJJ  lacked  details \nsufficient  for  implementation. \nBy  agreement  of the  parties,  national  experts  Christopher  Murray,  Chris  Baird,  Fred  Mills,  Ned \nLoughran  and  John  Platt  were  retained  to  review  and  revise  the  Safety  and  Welfare  Remedial \nPlan  in  consultation  with  the  parties  and  experts  serving  under  the  Consent  Decree.  The  experts \naffirmed  the  planning  reflected  in  DJJ’s  initial  version  and  refined  and  strengthened  the  Plan  by \nrevisions  which  are  reflected  in  this  document \nrenee OWyA N  @, ORYRG AETAN TNSIDAA  TION \nThis Plan  ij s  organized  around  major  elements  of a  comprehensive  reform  plan.  Those  elements \nare  as  follows: \nCreate  Capacity  for  Change \nReduce  Violence  and  Fear \nIdentify  a  Treatment/Rehabilitative  Model \nLay  the  Foundation  for  Treatment  Reform \nConvert  Facilities  to  Rehabilitative  Model \nReform  System  for  Females \nOther  Issues \nEach  section  of this  Plan  addresses  one  of these  major  elements.  In  all  cases,  each  section  begins \nwith  a  brief description  of The  Issue.  This  is  followed  by  a  Discussion  section  wherein  details \nconcerning  deficiencies  and  required  changes  are  presented.  Each  section  concludes  with  an \nAction  Plan.  A  plan  for  monitoring  for  compliance,  including  Standards  and  Criteria  and \nidentification  of Actions  Necessary  to  Achieve  Compliance,  will  be  filed  by  October  31,  2006. \nThe  October  31  document  will  contain  completion  dates  for  all  the  action  plan  items  in  this  Plan \nthat  do  not  already  have  specific  completion  dates. \nPage  |\n     \nRWYE LAATWIEO:N SHNBY  \nDJJ  will  work with  the Farrell  Consent  Decree  experts i in\" the  areas  of medical  care,  education, \ndisability  and  sexual  behavior  treatment  in  order  to  reconcile  the  previously  filed  plans in  those \nareas  with  this  Plan.  In  the  interim,  as  inconsistencies  between  this  Plan  and  one  of those  plans \nare  identified,  DJJ  will  notify  plaintiff’s  counsel,  the  Special  Master  and  the  appropriate  Consent \nDecree  expert(s)  to  convene  a  discussion  to  resolve  the  discrepancy.  If discrepancies  are  not \nresolved  by  agreement,  they  will  be  resolved  using  the  dispute  resolution  procedure  under \nparagraphs  48  and 49  of the  Consent  Decree. \nReference ®  throushout tt his  Plan  to numbers  and  types  of staff reflect  DJJ’s  and  its  expert \nconsultants’  judgments  at  the  time  the  Plan  was  filed  as  to  the  numbers  and  type  of  staff \nnecessary  for  successful  implementation.  References  to  positions  are  working  titles  rather  than \nspecific job  classifications.  DJJ  will  adjust  staffing  levels  and  types  of  staff when  such  changes \nare  necessary  to  achieve  programmatic  compliance.  DJJ  shall not  be  found  in  non-compliance \nbased  solely  on  the  number  or  type  of staff in  a  particular  program  or  function  where  DJJ  is  in \nprogrammatic  compliance. \nBefore  it  makes  substantial  reductions  in  the  staffing  set  forth  in  this  Plan,  DJJ  shall  provide  at \nleast  sixty  days  notice  to  plaintiffs  counsel  and  the  Special  Master.  This  notice  will  demonstrate \nthat  the  proposed  reduction  will  not  hamper  DJJ’s  progress  towards  programmatic  compliance  in \nany  area  covered  by  this  Plan.  Changes  in  types  or  classes  of  staff that  result  in  reducing \nqualifications  of significant  numbers  of  staff 1s  deemed  a  “reduction”  in  staff for  purposes  of this \nparagraph.  Any  dispute  between  the  parties  over  reductions,  whether  reductions  are  substantial, \nor  whether  reductions  are  likely to  hamper  DJJ’s  progress  towards  programmatic  compliance \nwill  be  resolved  pursuant  to  paragraphs  48  and  49  of the  Consent  Decree. \nThe pp rimary  goal  of the  Division  of  J uvenile  Justice  is  to  enhance  public  safety,  by  providing  a \nsafe,  secure,  productive,  and  accountable  system  in  which  staff,  local  stakeholders,  victims,  the \ncommunity,  youth  and  their  families  work  toward  returning  youth  to  the  community  as \nresponsible  and  productive  citizens.  The  mission  of DJJ  is  defined  by  law: \n“To  protect  society from  the  consequences  of  criminal  activity  and  to  that  purpose \ncommunity  restoration,  victim  restoration,  and  offender  training  and  treatment  shall \nbe  substituted  for  retributive  punishment  and  shall  be  directed  toward  the \nrehabilitation  of young persons  who  have  committed public  offenses.” \n-Welfare  &  Institutions  Code  Section  1700 \nEnsuring  community  safety  refers  to  both  immediate  and  long-term  safety.  The  Division  of \nJuvenile  Justice  (DJJ)  will  place  youth  in  secure  facilities  that  provide  treatment/rehabilitation \naimed  at  reducing  risk  and  increasing  protective  factors.  Long-term  safety  will  require  ongoing \nefforts  with  local  stakeholders  to  determine  strategies  to  most  efficiently  and  effectively  protect \ncommunities  and  rehabilitate  youth. \nPage  2\n set\nThis  Remedial  Plan  is  guided  by  the  following  key  principles:  California’s  state  juvenile \ncorrections  system  will  ensure  protection  and  safety  for  victims,  communities,  staff,  and  youth \nby: \n  Providing  safe,  secure  facilities; \nO—_ \nProviding  effective  rehabilitative  treatment  to  reduce  recidivism; \nN\n3.  Preparing  youth  for  re-entry  to  the  community  and  providing  opportunities  to  address \npersonal,  social,  physical,  educational,  and  vocational  needs; \n4.  Strengthening  the juvenile justice  continuum,  through  collaboration  with  stakeholders, \ncommunities,  and  families; \n5.  Implementing  restorative justice  practices  to  ensure  rehabilitation  includes  accountability \nto  victims,  the  community  and  themselves;  and \n6.  Continuously  evaluating  program  quality,  outcomes,  and  effectiveness. \nThese  principles  mirror  the  goals  outlined  in  CDCR’s  Strategic  Plan  adopted  through  the \nDepartment’s  2004/05  reorganization  effort. \nThe  outline  below  identifies  some  of the  ways  in  which  the  attached  plan  addresses  each  of these \nprinciples.  Implementation  will  be  accomplished  by  phasing  these  strategies  into  specific  units. \nOutcomes  will  be  measured  to  determine  effectiveness  during  the  phased  implementation. \nProvide  safe,  secure  facilities \nSafety  and  security  are  the  foundation  of a  responsible justice  system.  Positive  change  can \noccur  only  when  staff and  youth  feel  safe.  To  provide  safe,  secure  facilities,  the  top  priorities \nwill  be  to: \ne  Increase  the  staff to  youth  ratios; \ne  Develop  and  implement  a  long-term  plan  to  provide  smaller  living  units;  and \ne  Provide  staff with  specific  skills  to  manage  youth  in  a  responsive  manner. \nEnhanced  staffing  on  smaller  living  units  will  allow  more  time  for  interaction  with  the  youth, \nquicker  response  to  misconduct,  and  more  opportunities  for  individual  interaction. \nRehabilitation/treatment  will  be  improved  by  offering  additional  small  groups  and  more \nindividual  counseling.  By  having  more  staff,  with  fewer  youth,  safer  units  are  possible. \ne  Staff will  be  trained  on  a  variety  of conflict  resolution,  mediation,  negotiation  and \nde-escalation  techniques; \ne  Special  emphasis  will  be  given  to  addressing  issues  of gang  involvement,  gang  violence, \nand  ethnic  tensions; \ne  Behavior  management  techniques  will  be  enhanced  to  respond  to  youth  through  a \nstrength-based  system  of  graduated  sanctions,  contingency  management,  and  incentives; \ne  Staff will  be  provided  specific  motivational  enhancement  strategies  to  work  with  youth \nwho  are  resistant  to  programming; \ne  Each  unit  will  combine  accountability  and  rehabilitation  components  designed  to  deter \nfuture  delinquency  and  protect  the  community. \nPage  3\nA  process  will  be  put  in  place  to  review  staff duties  and  the  needed  functions  of each  unit.  A \nplan  will  be  developed  to  assign  responsibilities  to  the  appropriate  staff and  provide  training \nand performance  support  to  ensure  staff can  adequately  and  safely  perform  the  functions \nexpected  of them. \n emPCaBrFeloCmi oo vefwt ritoirerd deron   neestar re, ia%D  peorste, i iWere we S 5 ceo2thmi vmei trteehadeas b itSla ttl ofet   Hadleivrsv eel opne ee irSnP eagka &  d  ,nofaan n  effepap.

Youth  committed  to  DJJ  have  typically  utilized  and  exhausted  local  and/or \ncommunity-based  behavior  management  and  treatment  resources.  Their  service  needs  can  be \nboth  acute  and  complex.  Youths  committed  by  the  Juvenile  Courts  will  eventually  be \nreleased  to  the  community.  Therefore,  reducing  recidivism  through  research-based \nrehabilitative  programs  will  be  a  key  component  to  long-term  public  safety.  While  the  model \nwill  need  to  be  adapted  for  different  populations,  there  will  be  a  standardized  core  program \nimplemented  throughout  the  system.  The  goal  of the  program  is  successful  re-entry  to  the \ncommunity.  Planning  for  re-entry  into  the  community  will  begin  upon  entry  to  the  system. \nAll  staff will  be  trained  on  the  core  program  model  and  quality  assurance  measures  will  be \nimplemented  that  increase  communication  and  create  a  process  for  continual  improvement. \nThis  process  will  also  facilitate  sharing  expertise  across  facilities. \nA  comprehensive  system  will  be  established  to  accurately  assess  the  risks  and needs  of the \nyouths  and  match  rehabilitation/treatment  services  to  meet  their  needs,  while  building  on  and \ndeveloping  strengths  and  protective  factors.  As  part  of the  comprehensive  system,  DJJ  will \nutilize  assessments  to  identify: \ne  Appropriate  facility/unit/program  placement \ne  Targets  for  intervention  (risks/strengths) \ne  Needs  not  necessarily  linked  to  offense  behavior  (e.g.  mental  health,  medical,  education) \nIn  addition,  reassessments  will  be  utilized  to  determine  progress  and  modify  interventions, \nprograms,  and  strategies  accordingly,  to  increase  effectiveness. \nThe  Principles  of Effective  Intervention  (Andrews  &  Bonta,  1994)  will  provide  a  framework \nfor  the  new  rehabilitative  model.  These  include: \nRisk Principle  —  Match  the  intensity  of treatment/services  and  supervision  to  the  risk \nlevel  of the  youth. \nNeed Principle  —  Target  criminogenic  needs  (dynamic  risk  factors  that  are  closely  linked \nto  offending). \nResponsivity  Principle  —  Deliver  interventions  in  a  style  and  mode  that  is  consistent  with \nthe  ability  and  learning  style  of the  youth  and  match  practitioner  style  and  mode  of \nintervention  to  the  special  characteristics  of the  youth. \nProgram  Integrity  Principle  — Use  assessments  and  programs  as  intended;  ensure  staff is \nproperly  trained  and  there  is  adequate  oversight/monitoring  of  the  program  to  ensure \nquality  services  and  evaluation  of outcomes. \nPage 4\nDJJ  will  use  program  criteria  from  the  “What  Works”  literature  to  guide  in  the  selection \nand/or  improvement  of programs  for  our  youth. \nProfessional Discretion  Principle  —  Recognizing  that  no  assessment,  criteria,  or  model \ncan  account  for  all  variables,  the  system  must  expect  staff to  consider  risk,  need  and \nresponsivity,  and  allow  for  “override”  decisions  to  be  made,  as  appropriate.  Override \ndecisions  will  be monitored  and  evaluated. \nYouths  will  be  required  to  participate  in  rehabilitative  efforts  in  areas  identified  as  strongly \nrelated  to  future  criminal  delinquency.  In  order  to  provide  effective  interventions,  staff must \nbe  able  to  assess  the  youths’  willingness  to  participate  in  interventions  and  be  able  to \nmotivate  and  engage  them  in  treatment.  Staff will  be  trained  to  assess  the  stage  of change \n(Prochaska  and  DiClemente,  1982)  for  each  youth,  and  will  be  provided  skills  training  in \nmotivational  interviewing  (Miller  and  Rollnick,  1991,  2001)  to  assist  them  in  engaging \nyouths  in  interventions. \n3)  Prepare  youth  for  re-entry  to  the  community  by  providing  opportunities  to  address \npersonal,  social,  physical,  educational,  and  vocational  needs \nThe  Division  of Juvenile  Justice  recognizes  a  responsibility  to  promote  healthy  development \nof the  youths  in  its  custody.  Therefore,  in  addition  to  addressing  criminogenic  needs,  DJJ  will \nprovide  treatment  for  mental  health,  ensure  gender  specific  interventions,  address  ethnic \ntension  and  gang  related  issues,  and  promote  the  healthy  development  of youth. \ne  Programming  will  have  a  strong  educational  focus,  with  priority  on  pursuing  and \nobtaining  a  high  school  diploma  when  possible,  and  will  include  opportunities  for post- \nsecondary  education  for  youth  with  a  high  school  diploma  or  GED; \ne  Vocational  programs  will  train  youth  in  marketable  skills  and  will  provide  skills  and \nsupport  necessary  to  obtain  and  maintain  employment; \nRecreation  and  religious  services  will  be  available  and  accessible; \nCultural  awareness  and  sensitivity  will  be  promoted; \ne  Rehabilitation/treatment  and  services  will  build  on  strengths,  promote  independence  and \nself-reliance,  and  develop  competencies  and  life  skills; \ne  Assessments  will  be  done,  and  individual  treatment will  be  provided,  to  address  special \nneeds. \nFemale  Population \nDJJ  recognizes  that  the  needs  and  issues  facing  delinquent  females  are  different  from  those  of \ndelinquent  males  and  require  a  gender-appropriate  response.  A  comprehensive  approach  will \nbe  incorporated  in  programming  for  females  to  address  the  social  context  of their  lives,  their \nrelationships  with  staff,  each  other,  their  families  and  communities,  and  to  address  their \nunique  needs  and  issues  (e.g.,  physical/sexual/emotional  victimization,  trauma,  physical  and \nmental  health,  pregnancy  and  parenting)  in  a  safe,  trusting,  supportive  and  gender-responsive \nenvironment. \nPage  5\nSuccessful reintegration o \nparticipation  of communities,  families/other  support  networks,  the  youth,  and  other \nstakeholders.  DJJ  will  strengthen  the  continuum  of  services  through: \ne  Increased  communication  and  information  sharing  among  all  stakeholders  in  an  open, \nsolution-focused  manner,  dedicated  to  quality  improvement; \ne  Working  with  the  counties  and  other  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  the  entire juvenile justice \ncontinuum  is  continually  improving; \ne  Developing  system  improvements  and  finding  additional  ways  to  share  resources  and \nenhance  services  provided; \ne  Engaging  family  members  in  all  aspects  of the  youths’  rehabilitation/treatment,  when  not \ndetrimental  to  the  youth’s  success; \ne  Providing  incentives to  families  for  involvement  in  opportunities  to  increase  skills  and/or \nparticipate  in  treatment; \ne  Inviting  families  to  assist  in  identifying  opportunities  of involvement  and  opportunities \nfor  referrals  or  direct  services  to  meet  needs  that  will  assist  youth  in  successful \nreintegration. \nTreatment/rehabilitation  interventions  will  incorporate  restorative  justice  practices  that  will \nincrease  youths’  understanding  of the  harm  caused  to  their  victim(s)  and/or  survivor(s)  and \nthe  community.  DJJ  will  require  accountability  of youths  to  be  demonstrated  by  an  awareness \nof the  impact  of their  crime(s)  on  victims,  and  by  their  compensation  to  victims  and \ncommunities.  Youths  will  be  expected  to  find  ways  to  make  amends  to  victims  through \nrestitution,  community  service,  and  active  involvement  in  repairing  harm  caused. \ne  Incorporate  restorative justice  principles  within  and  throughout  all  programming. \ne  Develop  intervention  strategies  that  provide  opportunities  for  youth  to  increase  their \nunderstanding  of the  harm  they  have  caused  to  victims,  their  families,  and  the  community. \ne  Increase  opportunities  for  victims  to  provide  information  and  input  to  staff,  so  victim  issues \ncan  be  addressed  in  Individual  Change  and  Accountability  Plans. \ne  Establish  Victim  Services  and  Restitution  Specialists  to  ensure  restorative  principles  are \nincorporated  throughout  each  facility. \ne  Include  victim  impact  and  restitution  information  in  the  Orientation  Program. \noe, “ee  Q we ¢ \neffectiveness  of the  new  model.  Each  goal  will  have  identified  expected  outcomes.  A  plan \nwill  be  developed  to  track  outcome  measures  electronically.  An  interim  plan  may  need  to  be \ndeveloped  to  track  information  manually,  until  the  electronic,  automated  tracking  is \navailable.  Specific  measures  of success  will  be  pre-determined.  Staff will  be  trained  on  what \nto  document,  who  is  expected  to  document  it,  how  it  will  be  documented  and  when  it  will  be \ndocumented.  Documented  information  will  be  periodically  and  randomly  audited  to  ensure \nintegrity  of the  data. \n  \n Pag e  6\nEach  new  component  of this  plan  will  be  linked  to  an  expected  outcome.  As  components  are \nimplemented,  auditing  and  evaluation  measures  will  be  put  in  place  to  measure  specific \nachievements  and  short  and  long-term  outcomes.  A  process  improvement  model  will  be \ndeveloped  to  ensure  DJJ  can  continue  to  make  incremental  progress  and  build  on  successes. \nThe  new  model  must  be  implemented  thoughtfully  and  incrementally.  As  processes  and \nprograms  are  implemented,  the  agency  must  ensure  time  for  evaluation  and  input  from \nexperts  to  guide  improvements  and  assist  in  building  on  successes. \nPage 7\nSECTION  2 \nCREATE  CAPACITY  FOR  CHANGE \nTHE  ISSUE \nTo  successfully  reform  its  facilities  to  a  rehabilitative  model,  DJJ  will  have  to  create  the  capacity \nfor  change.  Five  critical  elements  have  significantly  limited  the  division’s  ability  to  effect  change \nin  the  past.  These  are: \nInsufficient  management  resources  in  the  central  office  and  at  facilities, \nLack  of clarity  and  consistency  in  agency  policies  and  procedures, \nAn  inadequate  system  for  holding  staff accountable  at  all  levels, \nAn  inadequate  management  information  system  for  providing  managers  with  useful  data, \nInadequate  training,  particularly  in  regard  to juvenile  standards  of care  and  practice. \nThe  effect  of these  limitations  is  compounded  by  inadequate  staff to  youth  ratios  and  an \norganizational  culture  that,  until  recently,  has  had  limited  exposure  to,  and  knowledge  of, \ncontemporary  standards  of care  and  practices  at  the  national  level. \nDISCUSSION \nComponents  of Effective  Juvenile  Correctional  Agencies \nIn  addition  to  sufficient  staffing  at  the  management  level,  the  administration  of multiple \ninstitutional  systems  within  an  agency  cannot  be  effectively  accomplished  without  a  foundation \nbased  on  established  contemporary  standards  of care.  The  foundation  must  include  approved \nprocedural  methodologies,  checks  and  balances  which  establish  accountability,  and  measures  of \nperformance  whose  results  are  reported  to  the  public.  The  core  requirements  to  achieve  such  a \nsystem  are: \nPolicy  Structure \nTraining \nQuality  Assurance \nData-based  Management \nCorrective  Action \nAnnual  Reporting  of Performance  Measures  and  External  Oversight \nPolicy  Structure \nThose  states  with  effective juvenile justice  systems  have  systems  that  are  managed  through  an \nadministrative  system  of  structured  policies  that  are  based  on  contemporary  standards  of care  and \npractice  that  are  written  in  support  of the  agency  mission.  These  comprehensive  and  uniform \npolicies  are  reviewed  annually  and  updated  as  needed.  Policy  requires  that the  facilities  and \naftercare  divisions  of the  system  institute  approved  practices  to  carry  out  the  agency  policies  and \nthat  these  practices  be  systematically  and  uniformly  audited.  It  is  generally  the  responsibility  of \nthe  local  facility  or program  to  write  local  directives  that  incorporate  the  requirements  of each \npolicy. \nPage  8\nThe  structured  controls  in  this  model  are  intended  to  systematically  ensure  that  contemporary \nstandards  of care  are  uniformly  achieved,  periodically  evaluated,  well  documented,  and  that \nmandatory  corrective  action  plans  are  developed  to  address  deficiencies. \nAgency  policy  establishes  definitions  that  are  consistent  between  all  other policies  and  which  are \nuniformly  taught  in  the  training  academy  and  incorporated  into  curriculums  and  all  documents \nand  forms.  These  universal  definitions  must  also  be  incorporated  into  the  local  policies. \nTraining \nEffective juvenile justice  management  systems  incorporate  mandatory  training  standards  to \nprovide  employees,  contract  staff and  volunteers  with  knowledge  and  skills  to  implement  agency \npolicy  through  consistent  employment  of  standard  practices  and  protocols.  Mandatory  training  is \nprovided  through  a  system  of certified  trainers  using  curriculums  that  have  been  approved  and \nestablished  by  the  agency training  authority. \nAll  training  in  approved  practices  is  competency  based.  Modifications  or  additions  to  training \noccur  based  on  review  of performance-based  outcome  measures  and  research  findings.  All \nindividual  training  is  documented  for  each  employee. \nCollateral  measures  of performance  are  written  into  employee job  descriptions,  post  orders,  and \nduty  requirements  and  are  reflected  in  systems  established  for  both  probationary  and  annual \nevaluations  of employee  performance.  Goals  are  established  that  relate  to  performance  outcomes \nand  measures  that  are  linked  to  agency  policy  and  performance  objectives. \nThe  agency’s  Training  Director  approves  all  training  curricula,  certification  of trainers,  and \nstandards  for  employee  certification  and  recertification.  Where  applicable,  trainers  will  receive \nexternal  certification  for  specific  types  of training. \nQuality  Assurance \nThe  requirements  for  conformance  to  performance  standards  are  embodied  in  the  agency’s \npolicies,  supported  by  approved  training  methods,  reflected  in  staff evaluations,  and  measured  by \nthe  incorporation  of comprehensive  internal  audits  of all  agency  practices  by  quality  assurance \nmechanisms.  These  audit  mechanisms  are  established  for  each  operational  policy  and  annual \nreviews  are  undertaken  for  both  conformance  to  policy,  approved  practices,  and  operational \nmeasures  of performance. \nCritical  measures  of performance  are  established  for  all  levels  of services  and  functions.  These \ndata  serve  to  guide  management  decisions  that  are  based  on  a  systematic  appraisal  of outcome \nmeasures  for  the  agency’s  various  component  systems,  facilities,  programs  and  individuals. \nAn  annual  agency  audit  schedule  is  produced  for  all  facilities  and  programs.  Audit  teams  are \ncreated  from  trained  audit  staff and  from  other  facilities’  internal  auditors.  This  produces  cross- \nfertilization  of compliance  experience  and  builds  expertise.  The  facility  superintendent  is \nresponsible  for  establishing  an  internal  audit  structure  to  meet  the  schedule  of the  agency.  He/she \nis  held accountable  for  the  effective  management  of the  audit  process  locally. \nThe  performance  of the  facility  or program  is  measured  against  the  audit  compliance  standards  to \nproduce  a  measure  of institutional  excellence.  Agency  goals  are  incorporated  into  facility \nPage  9\nimprovement  plans.  Audit  goals  are  incorporated  into  all job  descriptions  and  performance \nreviews.  Accountability  is  shifted  to  measurable  outcomes  at  every  level.  Outcomes  are \nreviewed,  a  process  is  in  place  to  determine  the  reason  for poor  outcomes,  and  plans  are  put  in \nplace  to  address  the  deficiencies.  Poor  managers  are  removed. \nIn  order  for  uniform  expectations  for  the  care  and  treatment/rehabilitation  of youth  to  be  met, \neveryone  must  be  held  to  the  same  basic  set  of  standards,  trained  by  same  basic  curriculum  for \neach  relevant  standard,  and  measured  by  the  same  methods.  (Additional  standards  and  training  is \nneeded  for  staff with  additional  or  higher  levels  of responsibility.) \nData  Based  Management \n  \nCritical  management  information  is  defined  in  agency  policy  and  collected  systematically  by \neffective juvenile justice  management  information  systems  in  order  to  provide  agency  managers \nwith  reports  with  which  to  monitor  key  indicators  of a  system’s  performance,  identify  and \nrespond  to  emerging  issues,  and  manage  more  effectively  the  shifting  needs  of the  population. \nEstablishment  of a  comprehensive  management  information  system  (including  having  sufficient \nprogrammers  needed  to  make  changes  and  be  responsive  to  user  needs)  is  the  key  component \nthat  creates  the  capacity  for  effective  planning  and  efficient  management  of risk. \nCorrective  Action \nSystems  are  re-built  based  on  establishing  policy  requirements,  providing  training  (certified,  as \nappropriate),  measuring  outcomes  through  a  comprehensive  audit  process,  and  applying \nappropriate  solutions  to  improve  outcomes,  in  a  manner  that  ensures  that  those  responsible  for \ncorrecting  deficiencies  are  held  accountable. \nIt  is  important  to  recognize  that  the  reasons  for poor  outcomes  must  be  evaluated  to  determine \nthe  appropriate  solutions.  This  is  especially  important  during  periods  of substantial  change. \nSolutions  can  include  change  in  policy/procedures,  additional  training,  on-the-job  coaching,  and \nchanges  in  process  or  protocols. \nAn  overall  shift  in  practices  is  needed  to  move  from  a  punitive  model  to  a  rehabilitative  model. \nManagers  and  supervisors  will  be  trained  in  motivational  enhancement  techniques,  not  only  to \nassist  their  staff in  applying  the  skills  with  youth,  but  to  recognize  the  importance  of,  and  use,  the \nskills  in  their  daily  management  practices  and  interactions  with  staff. \nIt  is  recognized  that  there  will  be  a  substantial  learning  curve  for  staff as  the  components  of the \nnew  model  are  implemented.  Staff training  will  include  classroom  training,  on-the-job  coaching, \nmentoring,  and  skills  refresher  courses.  Managers  and  supervisors  are  to  recognize,  reinforce, \nand  reward  positive  performance  and,  where  needed,  ensure  that  staff receive  coaching  and  skill \ntraining.  A  system  will  be  put  in  place  to  provide  staff a  method  to  identify  barriers,  ask \nadditional  questions,  clarify  expectations,  and  receive  feedback. \nAn  accountability  system  must  also  be  put  in  place,  to  ensure  policy  is  followed.  Corrective \nAction  Plans  are  written  within  the  time  frame  agreed  to  at  the  external  audit  exit  interview.  A \nre-audit  of those  areas  found  in  non-compliance  is  conducted  by  the  Agency  Audit  Manager \nfollowing  reported  compliance  by  the  audited  entity  or  after  expiration  of the  agreed  upon  time \nframe  for  achieving  compliance.  Where  non-compliance  is  found,  corrective  action  is  mandated \nPage  10\nand  staff is  held  accountable.  Non-compliance  is  first  viewed  as  a  training  opportunity.  Persistent \nnon-compliance  is  included  in  personnel  evaluations  linked  to job  performance  indicators  for \nboth  managers  and  staff. \nAnnual  Reporting  of Performance  Measures  and  External  Oversight \nE ffective juvenile justice  systems   issue  comprehensive  annual  reports  to  the  public  that  provide \ndetailed  analysis  of their  system’s  performance,  including  critical  indicators  of performance, \naudit  findings,  and  corrective  action  plans  that  are  program  or  system  related.  They  are  subject  to \nindependent  review  and  external  oversight  by  independent  authorities  which  serves  to  strengthen \nthe  agency’s  credibility  and  reinforce  adherence  to  standards  of care,  constitutional  practices  and \ncommitment  to  mission.  These  management  mechanisms  are  supplemented  by  external  reviews \nby  accrediting  organizations  and  licensing  boards  and  through  the  use  of ombudsmen,  Inspectors \nGeneral  and  other  governmental  oversight  and/or  audit  commissions  that  help  to  establish \ncontinuous  public  accountability. \nJuvenile  Standards  of Care  and  Practice \nCalifornia  is  in  a  minority,  but  is  certainly  not  alone,  in  having  its juvenile  corrections  agency \nadministered  from  within  an  adult  corrections  agency.  Since  state juvenile  corrections  agencies \nare  always  much  smaller  than  state  adult  corrections  agencies,  maintaining  separation  between \nthe  two  in  critical  areas  is  key  to  maintaining the  identity  and  integrity  of the juvenile  authority. \nThe  issue,  of course,  is  to  prevent  the juvenile  authority  from  being  overwhelmed  by  the  adult \nauthority  and  thereby  being  transformed  into  a  smaller  version  of the  adult  system. \nThe  experience  of other  states  shows  that  it  is  possible  to  maintain  this  separation.  California, \nhowever,  starts  with  a  distinct  disadvantage:  the  challenge  is  not  to  prevent  the  state’s juvenile \nfacilities  from  becoming  like  adult  prisons  -  that  has  already  happened.  The  experts  responsible \nfor  reviewing  and  refining  the  Safety  and  Welfare  Plan  invented  new  words  to  describe  this \nsituation:  California’s juvenile  facilities  have  become  “prisonized.”  The  challenge  is  to  transform \nan  operational  culture  that  has  been  “adultified’”  into  something  quite  different. \nThe  two  areas  where a  firewall  needs  to  be  established  between  the  adult  and juvenile  sides  of \nthe  CDCR  are  policy  and  training.  Generally,  policies  for juvenile  facilities  and  adult  prisons  are \nfundamentally  different.  Because  training  is  based  on  policy,  as  policies  differ,  so  too  must \ntraining. \nThe  term  “‘firewall”  is  generally  used  to  describe  a  hardware  and/or  software  solution  used  to \nenforce  security  policies  pertaining  to  access  between  two  or  more  computer  networks.  In  the \ncontext  of this  Plan,  the  concept  of firewall  is  used  to  describe  a  system  to  protect  the  integrity  of \nDJJ  policies,  procedures,  and  training  from  inappropriate  and  potentially  conflicting  policies, \nprocedures,  and  training  used  by  the  adult  division  of CDCR.  This  system  requires  that: \n1.  The  resources  needed  to  create  and  maintain juvenile  polices,  procedures,  and  training  are \ncapable  and  sufficient  for  those  purposes,  and \n  \n\"As  of September 2005,  11  states had the juvenile  corrections  agency  as  a part of an adult corrections  agency: \nCalifornia,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Louisiana,  Maine,  Minnesota,  Montana,  North Dakota,  South Dakota,  West Virginia, \nand Wisconsin. \nPage  11\n2.  A  system  of  checks  and  balances  exists  that  ensures  that  DJJ  policies,  procedures,  and \ntraining  reflect  contemporary  standards  of care  and  practice  for juvenile  correctional \nagencies. \nConsequently,  it  is  essential  that  DJJ  have  dedicated  staff for  policy  development,  revision,  and \ninterpretation.  These  staff must  be  knowledgeable  of contemporary  standards  of care  and \npractice  in juvenile  correctional  agencies.  Similarly,  DJJ  must  have  dedicated  staff responsible \nfor  developing  curricula  and  training  materials  consistent  with  DJJ  policies  and  standards.  These \nstaff must  also  be  specialists  with  knowledge  of juvenile  training  standards  and  curricula  and \nknowledge  of juvenile  standards  of care  and  practice.  To  this  end, job  descriptions  and \nqualifications  for  staff working  on juvenile  policy  development,  revision,  and  interpretation,  and \nthose  for  staff working  on  developing juvenile  training  curricula  and  standards,  are  to  include  a \nrequirement  for  knowledge  and  experience  in  contemporary  standards  of  care  and  practice  for \njuvenile  correctional  agencies. \nAt  the  same  time,  there  are  many  areas  where  coordinated  policy  planning  between  the  adult  and \njuvenile  divisions  within  CDCR  is  reasonable  -  for  example:  most  management,  budget, \nadministrative  support,  and  health  care  policies  could  be  the  same  or  at  least  very  similar.  This  is \nnot,  however,  true  for  areas  such  as  discipline,  use  of force,  incentives,  classification,  grievances, \nassessment  and  evaluation,  case  planning,  education,  treatment/rehabilitation  programs,  clothing \nand  personal  property,  work  programs,  etc. \nAs  noted  above,  a  policy-driven  agency  reviews  its  policies  annually  and  updates  them  as \nneeded.  It  is  through  this  annual  review  and  updating  process  that  DJJ  will  establish  the  checks \nand  balances  needed  to  ensure  that  its  policies,  procedures,  and  associated  training reflect \ncontemporary  standards  of care  and  practice  for juvenile  correctional  agencies.  To  accomplish \nthis,  those  staff responsible  for  annual  review  of DJJ  policies  will  first  review  the  latest  editions \nof applicable  national  standards.  They  will  also  confer  with  colleagues  with  similar \nresponsibilities  in  states  with  reputations  of maintaining  high  quality  policies  and  with  CDCR \nlegal  counsel  familiar  with  current  statutes  and  case  law  that  may  affect  policy  development. \nDOJr ganizationa   se ener er * SP tseb o\nprinciples  and  concepts  discussed  above  and  summarized  below.  The  intent  of this  section  is  to \nprovide  a  guide  for  central  office,  facility,  and  treatment  team  organization,  not  to  prescribe  a \nspecific  and  immutable  organizational  model.  DJJ  shall  have  discretionary  latitude  to  establish \nand  modify  its  organizational  structure  and  management  methods  and  procedures  so  long  as  they \nare  consistent  with  these  key  principles  and  concepts: \ne  DJJ  is  managed  through  an  administrative  system  of  structured  polices  that  are  based  on \ncontemporary  standards  of care  and  practice  for juveniles  and  young  adults  under  state \ncorrectional  control.  Policies  are  reviewed  annually  and  updated  as  necessary. \ne  Each  facility  is  managed  through a  set  of approved  local  directives  that  incorporate  the \nrequirements  of DJJ  policy.  It  is  the  superintendent’s  responsibility  to  carry  out  agency \npolicy  and  he  or  she  is  held  accountable  for  doing  so. \nPage  12\ne  Mandatory,  competency  based  training  is  provided  to  all  staff through  a  system  of \ntrainers  using  curriculums  that  have  been  established  and/or  approved  by  the  DJJ  training \nauthority. \ne  All  facilities  and  programs  are  audited  at  least  annually  for  conformance  to  agency \npolicy,  approved  practices  and  operational  measures  of performance. \ne  Corrective  action  plans  are  made  and  carried  out  to  address  all  deficiencies  identified \nthough  the  audit  process.  Corrective  action  plans  are  re-audited  and  compliance  or  non- \ncompliance  is  included  in  personnel  evaluations  of both  managers  and  staff. \ne  Critical  management  information  is  systematically  collected,  analyzed,  and  included  in \nreports  which  show  key  indicators  of agency,  facility,  and  program  performance. \nManagement  is  characterized  by  data-driven  decision  making  at  all  levels. \ne  Comprehensive  reports  that  include  information  on  critical  indicators  of performance, \naudit  findings,  corrective  action  plans,  and  fiscal  accountability  are  produced  annually \nand  provided  to  the Court,  the  Legislature,  and  the  public. \ne  The  Medical  Director  will  have  ultimate  and  final  authority  over  matters  of clinical \njudgment  in  compliance  with  state  and  federal  law.  The  Medical  Director  and \nSuperintendent  of Education  will  have  authority  over  matters  of personnel,  budget, \nhealthcare  services  program  content  and  educational  program  content,  as  delegated  by  the \nChief Deputy  Secretary  and  in  compliance  with  state  and  federal  law.  Once  budget \nallotments  are  made,  only  the  chief Deputy  Secretary,  DJJ  can  approve  the  transfer  of \nspending  authority  or  positions  into  or  out  of healthcare  services/mental  health  or \neducational  services  and  obtain,  as  needed,  authorization  from  CDCR  administration  and \nstate  governmental  agencies. \nCentral  Office  Organization \nThe  following  description  is  presented  as  an  example  of central  office  organization  that  conforms \nto  the  principles  and  concepts  outlined  above.  DJJ  shall  develop  and  maintain  a  central  office \norganizational  structure  that  similarly  accomplishes  these  objectives. \nCentral  office  is  organized  into  five  divisions:  facility  operations,  program \nservices,  management  services,  administrative  services,  and  community  and \ntransition  services.  Program  services  include  education,  medical  and  dental, \nmental  health,  recreation,  religious  services,  and  all  other  programs  for  DJJ \nyouths.  Management  services  include  policy,  quality  assurance,  compliance,  and \nresearch.  Administrative  services  (budgeting,  accounting,  personnel,  information \ntechnology,  etc.)  are  matrix  functions  within  CDCR.”  Community  and  transition \nservices  include  parole  and  community-based  services  for parolees.  Each \nfunctional  area  is  managed  by a  director  who  reports  to  the  Chief Deputy \nSecretary,  Division  of Juvenile  Justice. \n  \n* Training is both  a matrix  function and  a dedicated function within DJJ.  DJJ  will have dedicated  staff responsible \nfor developing  curricula  and training  materials  consistent with DJJ policies  and  standards. \nPage  13\nPolicy  and  quality  assurance  are  coordinated  within  the  management  services \ndivision.  Where  technical  or  professional  expertise  is  required  in  the \ndevelopment  or revision  of a  policy,  the  responsibility  for  drafting  those  parts \nrequiring  expertise  is  assigned  to  the  appropriate  functional  area  within  the \norganization.  A  system  is  in  place  that  ensures  that  draft  policies  receive  input \nfrom  all  relevant  parts  of the  organization  prior  to  review  and  approval  by  the \nChief Deputy  Secretary,  DJJ. \nDecisions  regarding  budget,  clinical,  programmatic  and  personnel  issues  in \nhealth  care,  mental  health  and  educational  services  are  made  by  the  Medical \nDirector,  the  Superintendent  of Education  respectively  and  the  Chief Deputy \nSecretary,  DJJ  as  described  above. \nFacility  Organization \nThe  following  description  is  presented  as  an  example  of facility  organization  that  conforms  to  the \nprinciples  and  concepts  outlined  above.  DJJ  shall  develop  and  maintain  facility  organizational \nstructures  that  similarly  accomplish  these  objectives.  Absent  compelling  differences  in  functional \ncomponents,  each  facility  is  to  be  similarly  organized. \nDJJ  facilities  are  organized  into  three  component  parts:  operations,  programs,  and \nbusiness  service  functions.  Each  functional  area  is  administratively  managed  by a  facility \nadministrator  who  reports  to  the  Superintendent.  The  institutional  organizational  model \nreflects  the  central  office  division  of responsibilities  and  its  structure  is  designed  to \nmeasure  the  performance  of managers  and  establish  their  accountability. \nThe  superintendent  is  responsible  for  his  or  her  facility.  His/her  responsibility  is  to  carry  out \ndivision  policy,  ensure  the  safe  and  orderly  operation  of the  facility,  and  ensure  programs  and \nservices  are  provided  to  youth.  The  superintendent will  ensure  all  staff comply  with  the  Program \nService  Day  schedule,  unless  there  are  safety/security  reasons  that  preclude  specific \nprogramming.  Clinical  decisions will  be  made  by  the  top  level  healthcare  clinician  at  the  facility \nor  his/her  designee.  Facility  budgets,  personnel  decisions/evaluations,  and  program  content  for \nhealth  care  (including  mental  health)  and  education  are  managed  as  as  noted  above. \nThe  chief medical  officer,  senior  psychologist  (or  highest  ranking  mental  health  clinician),  and \nschool  principal  are  members  of the  superintendent's  executive  team  and  participate  in  regular \nbriefings,  facility  committees,  and  other  administrative  meetings  as  appropriate.  A  protocol  will \nbe  established  to  ensure  that  if staff are  interfering  with  the  clinical  and/or  professional judgment \nof health  care,  mental  health  or  educational  staff,  those  issues  are  addressed  at  these  meetings.  If \nconsensus  is  not  reached,  the  issues  will  be  sent  up  the  chains  of authority  for  resolution. \nThe  superintendent  or  his/her  designee  may,  at  the  superintendent’s  discretion,  provide  input  to \npersons  completing  performance  evaluations  of all  health  care  services/mental  health  and \neducational  services  staff.  If the  superintendent  believes  that  the  top  level  administrators  are  not \nperforming  appropriately  and/or  in  accordance  with  agency  policy,  he  or  she  will  take  the \nconcern  up her  or  her  chain  of authority. \nTreatment  Team  Organization \n  \nThe  following  description  is  presented  as  an  example  of treatment  team  organization  that \nconforms  to the  principles  and  concepts  outlined  above.  DJJ  will  develop  and  maintain  treatment \nPage  14\nteam  organizational  structures  that  similarly  accomplish  these  objectives.  Treatment  teams  for \nCore  Rehabilitative/Treatment  Programs  and  Behavioral  Treatment  Programs  will  be  similarly \norganized  throughout  the  agency.  Special  program  units  will  be  organized  as  necessary  to  reflect \ntheir  functional  differences. \nTreatment  teams  are  organized  around  the  concept  that  the  treatment  team  is  responsible \nfor  addressing  the  behaviors  and  needs  of the  youth  assigned  to  the  team.  Each  team \nmember  is  responsible  for  the  progress  and  achievement  of the  youth.  Teams  should  be \nmulti-disciplinary  and  include  input  from  living  unit  staff,  treatment/rehabilitation \nservice  providers,  education,  medical,  mental  health,  parole,  family,  and  youth  as \nappropriate  and  possible.  Treatment  teams  make  decisions  and  recommendations \nregarding  individuals,  but  facility/central  office  teams  make  decisions  that  impact  more \nthan  one  youth  or  unit  (e.g.  priority  for  placement, jobs).  Facility  wide  services  support \nteam  decision  making  regarding  each  youth’s  behavior  and  monitor  the  effectiveness  of \nthe  approaches  used  by  the  team  in  guiding  the  youth's  development  and  conduct.  Each \nteam  member  has: \n1.  Technical  or  functional  expertise, \n2.  Problem  solving  and  decision-making  skills,  and \n3.  Good  interpersonal  skills. \nEach  team  member  requires  all  three  skills  for  the  team  to  be  effective,  but  different \nmembers  have  different  technical  or  functional  skills  as  appropriate. \nTreatment  teams  are  focused  on  goals  tied  to  the  Agency  Mission  and  outcomes  must  be \ndefined  by  the  Program  Model. \nThe  core  ingredients  that  define  effective  treatment  teams  are: \nClear  Goals  —  These  are  worthwhile  and  challenging  objectives  which  are \ncompelling  enough  to  create  a  strong  team  identity  and  which  have  clear  positive \nconsequences  connected  with  their  achievement. \nResults  Driven  Structure  —  The  team  structure  is  determined  by  the  objectives  to  be \nachieved  and  supported  by  clear  roles  and  lines  of responsibility,  open \ncommunication,  fact-based judgments,  and  methods  for providing  feedback  for both \nindividual  performance  and  team  achievements.  The  objectives  should  be  focused  on \nassisting  youths  to  achieve  goals  that  build  on  strengths  that  are  related  to  reducing \nrisk  and  increasing  skills. \nCompetent  Team  Members  -  Team  members  have  the  desire,  skills,  and  abilities \n  \nneeded  to  accomplish  the  team's  objectives. \nUnified  Commitment  -  Team  goals  inspire  members  to  devote  whatever  effort  is \nnecessary  to  collaboratively  achieve  team  success.  Team  goals  are  a  higher  priority \nthan  individual  objectives. \nPage  15\nCollaborative  Climate  —  Team  members  share  common  values  and  trust  each  other  to \na ccurately  s hare  information,  perceptions,  and  provide  honest  feedback. \nStandards  of Excellence  -  Teams  adopt  values  which  establish  high  standards  and \nchallenge  the  team  to  constantly  improve  performance. \nExternal  Support  and Recognition  —  There  are  sufficient  resources  and  external \nsupport  for  accomplishment  of the  team's  objectives.  This  includes  appropriate  forms \nof recognition  and  incentives,  cooperation,  guidance,  and  performance  feedback. \nPrincipled Leadership  -  The  treatment  team  leader  clearly  articulates  team  goals  that \na re  presented   in  a  way  to  inspire  commitment  and  actions.  Such  commitment  stems \nfrom  strong  adherence  to  basic  principles  of trusting  team  members  with  meaningful \nlevels  of responsibility,  establishing  benchmarks,  measuring  outcomes,  addressing \nineffective  performance  and rewarding  superior  performance. \nEach  team  has  a  single  leader  who  has  overall  responsibility  for  unit  operations  and \noutcomes.  The  roles  of the  treatment  team  leader  are: \n  Keep  the  purpose,  goals  and  approach  relevant  and  meaningful, \n>\n  Build  commitment,  confidence  and  accountability, \nN Strengthen  the  mix  and  level  of  skills, \nW\nR Manage  relationships  with  stakeholders,  including  removing  obstacles, \n  Create  opportunities  for  others,  and \nW\nDemonstrate  and  model  skills  with  youth  as  a  teacher  and  coach  for  staff. \nA\nInformation  Systems \nDJJ  lacks  effective  management  information  systems  and  an  organizational  culture  that  relies  on \ndata  to  inform  decision  making.  Existing  resources  in  information  technology  dedicated  to  DJJ \nare  insufficient  to  meet  the  MIS  planning,  design,  and  implementation  needs  for  system  reform. \nDJJ  will  develop  an  information  system  that  meets  these  needs.  Until  DJJ’s  MIS  system  is \nsufficient  to  track  DJJ’s  progress  towards  implementation  of this  Plan  and  measurable  outcomes, \nDJJ  will  develop  and  utilize  alternative  manual and/or  electronic  methods  for  compiling  and \ntracking  relevant  data. \nOperational  Data  Elements \nA  comprehensive  management  information  system  has  the  capability  of providing  operational \ndata  and  reports  at  central  office  and  at  facility  and  program  levels to  support  the  functions \noutlined  below.  Where  existing  systems  lack  the  capability,  DJJ  will  establish  manual  or  other \nmeans  to  systematically  collect  those  data  elements  needed  for  effective  operation  of the  agency \nand  its  programs.  The  categories  of data  required  include: \ne  The  administration  of population  management \n   Intake \n>\nN Orientation,  Rights  and  Responsibilities \nW\nw Rejection  Assessment/Classification/Placement/Reassessment \nR Assignment  based  on  service  and  custody  requirements \nA\nW Reclassification,  re-assignment  and  transfers \nPage  16\n6.  Parole  violator  reclassification \n7.  Transition  to  community  services \n8.  Transfers  to  other  custody \nManagement  of  custody  and  security  operations \n1.

Enterprise  Information  Systems  (EIS) \nstaff will  participate  in  planning  discussions  whenever  information  or reporting  systems  are  of \nimportance. \nWhile  it  does  not  address  all  areas  of need,  adopting  Performance-based  Standards  will  help  DJJ \nrecord  and  analyze  critical  data  and  improve  outcomes.  This  system  is  discussed  in  the  following \nparagraphs. \nPerformance-based  Standards \n  \nPerformance-based  Standards  (PbS)  is  a  nationally  recognized  self-improvement  and \naccountability  system  used  in  27  states  and  the  District  of Columbia  that  provides  technical \nassistance  to  develop  a  process  to  collect  and  analyze  data.  DJJ  has  committed  to  implement  PbS \nin  all  of its  facilities. \nPbS  standards  offer  DJJ  a  method  for  periodic  sampling  of outcome  results  that  are  linked  to \nexpected  practices.  There  are  seven  domains  in  the  PbS  system,  three  of which  are  sampled  from \nincident  reporting  characteristics:  measures  of safety,  order,  and  security. \nThese  outcome  measures  are  used  in  conjunction  with  other  PbS  measures  to  produce  reports \nreflective  of the  conditions  of confinement  at  each  facility.  The  system  has  the  capacity  to  do \nincident  mapping  and  custom  reporting  based  on  these  data. \nRecent  work  related  to  the  eight  years  of reported  data  in  the  PbS  database  provides  evidence  of \nvalid  correlations  between  standards  and  outcome  measures.  This  analysis  confirms  the  validity \nof the  relationship  between  PbS  standards,  expected  practices  and  positive  outcomes. \nPbS  provides  standard  implementation  services  and  technical  assistance  for  the  first  12  months \nwhile the  agency  begins  to  implement  the  program.  Ongoing  quality  assurance  is  also  provided. \nPbS  requires  data  collection  and  data  entry  at  each  facility  as  well  as  state-wide  oversight.  The \nprogram  describes  the  resources  needed  for  implementation  and  ongoing  operation.  Consistent \nwith  those  requirements,  DJJ  will  hire  the  staff necessary  for  statewide  coordination  and \nimplementation  of PbS. \nResearch \nDJJ  has  committed  to  establishing  outcome  measures  for  its  managerial  functions,  conditions  of \nconfinement,  and  programmatic  outcomes.  Comprehensive  data  sets  must  be  developed  that  can \nprovide  managers  with  periodic  pictures  of performance  and  systematic  movement  toward  the \nachievement  of goals  and  objectives.  Analysis  of this  data  can  provide  guidance  for  agency \nplanning.  Integration  of measures  to  ascertain  the  extent  to  which  the  agency  and  its  managers \nare  achieving  these  goals  becomes  a  critical  function  of applied  research  and  analysis. \nPage  18\nIt  is  not  isolated  research  that  is  needed,  but  practical  methods  for  ensuring  that  the  data  and \nmeasurements  are  collected  that  integrate  management,  programming,  and  operational \nrequirements  in  a  way  that  measures  outcomes,  guides  innovative  solutions,  and  provides  public \ninformation  related  to  progress  and  success. \nThe  research  manager  must  be  a  critical  advisor  in  the  development  of effective  measures  and \nreporting  processes  and  establishment  of  standards  for  data  quality  and  validity. \nPlanned  Additions  of Resources \nThe  number,  type,  and  titles  of  staff identified  here  and  elsewhere  in  this  Plan  are  subject  to  the \nconditions  and  restrictions  contained  in  Section  1. \nProgram  Development  and  Implementation  Staff \nFailure  to  develop,  implement,  and  monitor programs  1s  at  the  heart  of the  Farrell  lawsuit. \nDJJ  will  establish a  team  of  staff dedicated  to  program  development,  implementation,  training, \nand  quality  assurance  of the  new  program  model.  This  includes  development  of the  core \ntreatment  program,  developing  contracts  and  programming  for  females,  re-entry  planning, \nclassification,  and  other  key  components  of the  new  model.  This  team  will  work  with  the \ntrainers/quality  assurance  specialists  in  developing  the  model.  The  trainers/quality  assurance \nspecialists  will  be  responsible  for  training,  coaching,  and  mentoring  staff on the  new  program \nmodel  components.  In  addition  to  initial  training,  these  staff will  provide  follow-up  training  and \nquality  assurance  as  determined  by  monitoring  and  audits. \nTemporary  Transition  Team \n  \nDJJ  will  create  a  dedicated  transition  team  that  will  operate  for  at  least  the  first  36  months  of \nplan  implementation.  The  primary  focus  of this  team  will  be  assisting  with  organizational \ndevelopment  and  cultural  change  within  the  division  and  its  facilities. \nThis  team  will  assist  in  developing  plans,  contracting  with  experts,  identifying  action  steps,  and \nassisting  with  developing  training  curricula  and  materials.  They  may  also  help  to  develop \ntreatment  programs  and  facilitate  community  outreach.  Team  members  must  be  strong  advocates \nfor  the  rehabilitative  model  and  be  trusted  and  respected  by  their  peers  and  subordinates.  This \nteam  will  consult  with  national  experts  who  will  help  devise  strategies  and  provide  guidance  to \npromote  successful  organizational  development  and  cultural  change  within  DJJ  and  its  facilities. \nThe  tenure  and  size  of this  team  will  be  modified  if it  is  required  for  successful  implementation \nof this  Plan. \nTemporary  Compliance  Team \nAs  the  reform  plan  is  implemented,  the  need  to  collect  and  analyze  data  for  purposes  of \ndocumenting  and  reporting  to  the  court  and  others  will  substantially  increase.  DJJ  will  establish  a \ndedicated  Compliance  Team  for  Farrell  reforms.  Although  the  size  of the  team  may  change  as \nworkload  changes,  the  compliance  team  will  operate  until  all  Farrell  compliance  matters  are \nresolved.  It  is  anticipated  that  this  will  take  five  years  (the  four  years  planned  for  implementation \nplus  one  additional  year  to  address  outstanding  issues  and  address  remaining  problems). \nPage  19\nFarrell  Remedial Project  Director  and  Dedicated  Staff \nI n order  to  ensure  that  the  a bove  functions  can  be  carried  out  in  a  timely  manner,  DJJ  will  hire  a \nFarrell  Remedial  Project  Director  who  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  statewide \nimplementation  and  court  compliance,  eventually  including  the  integration  of all  Farrell  remedial \nplans.  As  indicated  earlier,  the  exact  numbers  and  types  of  staff on  these  teams  may  vary \ndependent  upon  the  demands  of each  implementation  phase.  At  certain  times,  some  team \nmembers  may  be  directed  to  work  in  the  field  to  assist  with  implementation.  However,  in \ngeneral,  the  three  teams  mentioned  above  will  include  a  minimum  of  11  team  members,  not \nincluding  analysts  or  support  staff,  plus  a  Project  Director.  Each  team  will  have  the  dedicated \nanalysts  and  support  staff necessary  to  carry  out  its  duties.  In  addition,  there  will  be  at  least  18 \ntrainers/quality  assurance  specialists. \nAdministrative  and  Central  Support  Staff at  DJJ  Facilities \nSimilar  changes  to  those  described  for  central  office  operations  need  to  be  made  at  DJJ  facilities. \nThose  changes  are  to  reflect  the  core  requirements  for  effective  management  outlined  at  the \nbeginning  of this  chapter. \nBy  the  time  all  living  units  at  a  facility  have  been  converted  to  the  reform  model,  DJJ  will  ensure \nthat  the  following  positions  are  filled: \ne  Program  Manager(s)  responsible  for  high-risk,  low-risk,  and  re-entry  programs  as \nneeded. \ne  Volunteer  Services  Coordinator/Positive  Incentives  Coordinator \nVocational  Specialist  to  provide  vocational  and  career  counseling  and  coordination  with \nparole  and  re-entry  specialists \nVictim  Services/Restitution  Specialist \nTraining  officer \nConflict  resolution  team(s) \nWork  Assignment  Coordinator  to  seek  out  and  develop  work  assignments  for  youth \nthroughout  the  facility,  monitor  and  assure  that the  maximum  number  of youth  are \nattending  Free  Venture  programs,  and  coordinate  and  develop  external job  assignments, \nwork  experience  programs,  and job  furlough programs. \ne  Facility  administrators  responsible  for  each  of the  following  areas:  operations,  programs, \nand  business  services.  These  administrators  will  report  directly  to  the  superintendent. \nACTION  PLAN \nAdd  Central  Office  Resources \nTo  create  the  capacity  for  change  in  central  office,  DJJ  will  add  or  appoint  the  following  staff. \n1.  A  Director  of Programs  by  October  1,  2006. \n2.  A  Farrell  Project  Director by  October  1,  2006. \n3.  A  team  of  staff by  October  1,  2006,  who,  as  described  above,  will  be  responsible  for  program \ndevelopment,  implementation,  training,  and  quality  assurance.  A  temporary  transition  team \nto  assist  with  transition  during  at  least  the  first  three  years  of reform.  Their  primary \nresponsibility  will  be  to  help  facilitate  implementation  of the  reform  plan  and  cultural \nchange.  A  Compliance  Team  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  Farrell  remedial  plans  until  all \nPage  20\ncompliance  matters  are  resolved.  In  general,  these  teams  will  include  at  least  11  staff plus \nanalysts  and  support  staff. \nThe  program  development,  implementation,  training,  and  quality  assurance  teams  will \ninclude  an  administrator  dedicated  to  matters  pertaining  to  female  youth.  This  person  will  be \nresponsible  for  developing  and  implementing  a  plan  to  contract  with  local  sites/vendors  for \nfemales,  developing  a  contingency  plan  for  females  in  the  event  contracting  is  unsuccessful, \nand  providing  quality  assurance  oversight  of female  programs  and  services. \n4.  By a  date  to  be  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  section  of this  Remedial  Plan,  DJJ  will \nhave  sufficient  and  appropriate  dedicated  staffing  for  developing  and  maintaining  policies  for \njuvenile  corrections  based  on  contemporary  standards  of care  and  practice.  Policies  will  be \nreviewed  annually  and  updated  as  necessary. \nConsistent  with  the  need  to  maintain  clear  separation  between juvenile  and  adult  training \ncontent  and  expectations,  added  staff will  include  dedicated  personnel  for \ndeveloping/approving juvenile  training  curricula,  certifying  trainers  for juvenile  corrections \nas  appropriate,  and  setting  standards  and  maintaining  records  for  DJJ  employee  certification \nand  recertification. \n5.  Over  the  first  year  of this  Plan,  DJJ  will  hire  at  least  18  trainers/quality  assurance  specialists. \nDJJ  will: \n1.  Produce  an  organizational  chart  for  central  office  consistent  with  principles  outlined  in  this \nsection  by  September  1,  2006. \n2.  Produce  an  organizational  chart  for  each  DJJ  facility  consistent  with  principles  outlined  in \nthis  section  by  October  1,  2006. \n3.  Designate  staff to  act  as  facility  compliance  monitors  and  to  develop  an  internal  compliance \nschedule  for  all  operations,  by  a  date  to  be  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  section  of \nthis  Remedial  Plan. \n4.  Develop  a  system  for  corrective  action  planning,  implementation,  and  review,  by  a  date  to  be \nspecified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  section  of this  Remedial  Plan. \n5.  Rewrite  local  directives  and  procedures  consistent  with  agency  policy.  This  will  be \ncompleted  incrementally  as  facilities  are  phased  in,  by  a  date  to  be  specified  in  the  Standards \nand  Criteria  section  of this  Remedial  Plan. \n6.

Unfortunately,  this  is  a  situation  that \nprevails  throughout  much  of DJJ.  Reducing  violence  and  fear  in  DJJ  facilities  is  therefore  the \nfirst  step  to  reform.  All  other  objectives,  including  the  goals  of gang  integration  and  placing \nyouth  as  close  to  their  family  and  community  as  possible,  must  be  subordinated  to  this  objective. \nOnce  safety and  order  are  returned,  reform  becomes  possible  and  other  objectives  can  be \npursued. \nDISCUSSION \nIndicators  of Violence  and  Fear \nViolence  and  the  fear  that  it  engenders  can  be  seen  in  the  data.  For  example,  during  fiscal  year \n2005  (July  2004  through  June  2005),  Serious  Incident  Reports  were  submitted  for: \n34  medical  emergencies  from  youth-on-youth  violence, \n53  medical  emergencies  from  youth-on-staff violence, \n145  group  disturbances, \n266  incidents  of battery  of  staff by  youth, \n84  incidents  of youth  throwing “foreign  substances”  at  staff, \napproximately  80  incidents  resulting  in  lockdowns  of multiple  youth,  and \nan  unknown  number  of incidents  of youth-on-youth  violence.” \nBased  on  reported  serious  incidents,  the  most  troubled  facilities  during  the  last  two  years  are  the \nHeman  G.  Stark,  N.  A.  Chaderjian,  and  Preston  youth  correctional  facilities.  Based  on  medical \nemergencies  related  to  battery  of youth  by  youth  or  staff by  youth,  Heman  G.  Stark  is  in  a  class \nby  itself with  nearly  half of all  such  incidents  in  DJJ during  the  last  two  fiscal  years. \nPerhaps  more  troubling  still  is  the  nature  of many  of the  incidents  that  occur  in  DJJ  facilities.  Of \nthe  67  incidents  that  resulted  in  lockdowns  during  the  period  from  March  1,  2005  through \nDecember  31,  2005,  nearly  80  percent  were  related  to  gang  or racial  violence. \nUse  of Force \nExamples  of the  use  of force  by  staff include  use  of oleoresin  capsicum  (pepper  spray),  chemical \nagents,  and  physical  restraints.  Use  of force  is  both  a  response  to,  and  an  indicator  of,  violence  in \nDJJ  facilities. \nA  prevention  strategy  to  reduce  violence  and  the  use  of force  is  needed.  This  strategy  is  based  on \na  continuum  of interventions,  a  use  of force  review  model  and  process,  procedures  for \nmonitoring  the  use  of  chemical  agents,  and  training. \nA  continuum  of prevention,  intervention,  and  use  of force  methods  will  be  adopted  by  DJJ  that \nincludes,  at  minimum: \n  \n*DIJ  stopped counting  youth-on-youth batteries  in April  2003.  Other parts  of this  plan require  immediate \nresumption of collection  of this  and  other data. \nPage  23\nPrevention \n  Dialogue/verbal  persuasion \nN\nVerbal  intervention  by  a  person  not  involved  in  the  incident \nW\n  Commands/authoritative  warnings \nA Deferral  of  action  pending  supervisory  presence  for  a  controlled  use  of force \nM\nY Containment  or  isolation \nA Controlled  show  of force \nN\nP Minimal  reliance  on  the  use  of physical,  chemical  or  mechanical  restraints  to  reduce \nthreats  to  safety  of  staff and  youth. \nUse  of Force  Review  Model  and  Process \nDJJ  will  adopt  a  Use  of Force  Review  Model  that  distinguishes  between  “immediate”  and \n‘controlled’  use  of force.  An  immediate  use  of force  is  necessary  and  appropriate  when  there  are \nno  other  options  available  except  to  subdue  an  attacker  in  order  to  defend  oneself,  prevent  harm \nto  another,  or prevent  escape.  Immediate  use  of force  must  not  be  premature  and  must  employ \nonly  those  methods  of restraint  that  are  sanctioned  by  DJJ  policy  and  training  and  which  are \nsufficient  to  overcome  resistance.  Use  of force  ceases  when  active  resistance  is  overcome. \nA  controlled  use  of force  is  employed  when  time  and  circumstance  permits  a  planned \nintervention.  Controlled  use  of force  requires  that  a  deliberate,  step-by-step  implementation \nprocess  be  followed  and  that  specific  staff are  present  before  controlled  force  is  used.  It  relies  on \nmethods  intended  to  reduce  the  possibility  of injury  to  youth  or  staff and  is  supported  by  ongoing \ntraining.  It  recognizes  that  the  use  of force  is  not  an  end  in  itself but  is  only  one  of  several  means \nto  achieve  an  end.  In  all  controlled  uses  of force  it  is  very  important  to  convey  to  the  youth(s) \ninvolved  that  no  force  will  be  employed  once  they  cease  resistance. \nA  controlled  use  of force  requires  the  presence  and  authorization  of a  Chief of  Security  or \nSuperintendent’s  designee,  the  presence  of medical  personnel,  mental  health  personnel  (when \npossible  and  if the  youth  is  on  a  mental  health  caseload),  and  videotaping.  All  controlled  use  of \nforce  is  to  be  preceded  by  a  cooling  down  period  to  allow  the  youth  to  voluntarily  comply  with \nstaff instructions.  Videotapes  are  to  be  retained  for  five  years. \nThe  Use  of Force  Review  Model  requires  that  both  supervisory  staff and  the  local  Institutional \nForce  Review Committee  (IFRC)  conduct  a  mandatory  review  of all  uses  of force  using  a \nstructured  and  consistent  process  that  is  supported  by  comprehensive  documentation  and \ntraining.  The  Institutional  Force  Review  Committee  is  made  up  of the  Superintendent/Assistant \nSuperintendent,  Chief of  Security,  a  mental  health  professional,  and  at  least  one  other  manager \nselected  on  a  rotational  basis.  A  standard  DJJ  approved  review  format  is  used  by  all  facilities. \nIn  addition,  DJJ  will  establish  in  each  facility  a  facility  Violence  Reduction  Committee  (VRC)  to \nreview,  map,  and  evaluate  all  incidents  of violence  quarterly.  This  information  is  to  be  used  to \nassist  in  the  development  of local  violence  reduction  plans  to  reduce  youth-on-youth  and  youth- \non-staff violence.  Successful  avoidance  of the  excessive  use  of force  starts  at  the  living  unit  level. \nConsequently,  each  VRC  will  create  a  violence  reduction  plan  for  the  facility  around  the \ndevelopment  of living  unit  treatment  teams.  The  VRCs  will  submit  violence  reduction  plans  to \nDJJ’s  Chief of  Security  Office  for review,  monitoring  and  sharing  of the  most  effective  practices \nPage  24\nwith  other  facilities.  The  VRCs  will  measure  and  report  the  impact  of these  efforts  in  violence \nreduction  by  living  unit  and  by  facility. \nThe  Use  of Force  Review  Model  also  establishes  a  second  level Department  Force  Review \nCommittee  (DFRC).  This  committee  is  to  ensure  that  facility  administrators  are  conducting  the \nrequired  qualitative  analysis  of all  use  of force  incidents  following  the  DJJ  mandated \nmethodology  and  that  they  are  maintaining  an  aggregate  use  of force  database  for  their  facility. \nThe  Department  Force  Review  Committee  is  to  meet  monthly  and  select  and  review  at  least  10 \npercent  of use  of force  incidents,  including  incidents  at  every  facility.  The  compliance  unit \nconducts  regular  on-site  audits  of use  of force  incidents  using  audit  instruments  that  are \nstandardized  and  approved  by  the  DJJ's  DFRC.  Corrective  action  is  to  be  undertaken  as  needed \nand  follow  up  audits  completed  to  confirm  compliance  and  accountability.  Audit  results  are  to  be \nreported  to  the  Chief Deputy  Secretary,  DJJ. \nThe  Institutional  Force  Review  Committee  (IFRC)  process  and  Department  Force  Review \nCommittee  (DFRC)  process  are  designed  to  provide  feedback  and  training  to  staff  in  a  timely \nway  to  ensure  that  staff are  following  policy  and  to  monitor  the  review  process.  The  review \nprocess,  when  used  appropriately,  is  a  powerful  tool  to  ensure  that  staff  are  only  resorting  to  use \nof force  when  absolutely  necessary  and  are  selecting  an  appropriate  use  of force  that  will \nminimize  injury  while  achieving  the  required  objective. \nAs  part  of this  process,  facility  management  should  extend  recognition  to  staff who  are  properly \nand  effectively  using  the  alternative  tools  to  manage  incidents  without  resort  to  force  or  where  it \nis  clear  that  only  the  amount  of force  that  was  necessary  to  effect  control  was  used.  Monitoring \nwill  be  done  to  ensure  that  employees  have  not  used  any  type  of force  against  a  youth  (including \nchemical  or  mechanical  restraint)  as  punishment,  retaliation,  or  for  disciplinary  purposes. \nThe  power  of the  process  derives  from  establishing  effective  communication  between \nmanagement  and  employees  and  through  follow  up  training  or  individual  correspondence  with \nregard  to  those  situations  in  which  the  employees  were  directly  involved,  or  in  situations \noccurring  at  the  facility  in  which  they  work,  where  some  form  of  corrective  action  is  mandated. \nThis  Plan  does  not  require  targeting  or  eliminating  any  specific  force  option  as  a  way  to  reduce \nreliance  on  force.  Such  requirements  can  have  negative  consequences  and  may  result  in  staff \nmigrating  to  the  use  of those  force  options  remaining  or  circumventing  the  approved  methods. \nSelection  of the  proper prevention  or  intervention  must  be  reinforced  by  training  following  the \nUOF  review  and,  if an  inappropriate  selection  of method  occurs,  by  appropriate  administrative \nactions.  The  reviews  are  to  examine  not  only  the  methods  employed  but  also  the  supervision \nextended  to  staff in  the  use  of force  incident  and  the  documentation  provided. \nMonitoring  the  Use  of Force \nIn  addition  to  the  Use  of Force  Review  Model  discussed  above,  in  consultation  with  the \nPlaintiffs’  Attorneys  and  the  appropriate  Safety  and  Welfare  Expert,  DJJ  will  develop  and  adopt  a \ndatabase  to  track  all  incidences  of violence  and  UOF  until  a  more  complete  centralized  MIS  is \nimplemented. \nPage  25\nIn  addition,  using  PbS  definitions,  DJJ  will  record  PbS  Safety  Outcome  Measures  numbers  2,  3, \n4,11,  and  12  for  every  day.  (Data  may  be  entered  on  a  regular,  as  opposed  to  daily,  basis  as  long \nas  all  outcome  measures  are  reported  for  all  days.)  Because  PbS  does  not  presently  permit \nrecording  of information  on  a  daily  basis,  these  data  may  be  recorded  in  a  separate  database  from \nthe  PbS  system.  These  data  will  be  analyzed  and  the  results  will  be  included  in  regular  staff \nbriefings  at  the  facility  and  central  office  level.  Reports  will  be  provided  to  the  plaintiffs  counsel, \nrelevant  Safety  and  Welfare  Expert,  and  Special  Master. \nProcedures  for  Monitoring  the  Use  of Chemical  Agents \nA  pilot  project  will  be  conducted  to  test  a  means  to  track  and  quantify  the  use  of chemical  agents. \nIn  this  study,  chemical  agents  not  assigned  to  individuals  (such  as  material  used  in  pepper  ball \nlaunchers  and  gas  guns)  are  to  be  inventoried  on  a  quarterly  and  per  use  basis.  Numbers  are  to  be \nassigned  to  each  pepperball  launcher  to  permit  tracking  of pepperballs  used  by  each  launcher. \nFurthermore: \ne  All  canisters  of chemical  agents  will  be  marked  with  a  unique  identification  code \nand  that  code  assigned  to  the  person  to  whom  the  canister  is  issued.  Returned \ncanisters,  including  partially  full  canisters  that  DJJ  determines  will  not  be \nreissued,  will  be  destroyed. \ne  Staff are  only  authorized  to  carry  and  use  chemical  agents  approved  and  issued  by \nDJJ. \ne  Inventory  records  of pepper  balls  issued  and  returned  will  be  maintained  by \npepperball  launcher  ID  number  and  the  name  of the  person  to  whom  the  pepper \nballs  were  issued. \ne  Accurate  records  will  be  kept  on  the  use  of all  chemical  agents  issued  and \nreturned.  Upon  return,  partly  empty  pepper  spray  canisters  will  be  weighed,  or \nfully  discharged  in  a  way  to  accurately  determine  the  quantity  used  and \nremaining.  Auditable  records  will  be  kept  at  the  facility  and  in  central  office. \ne  All  reports  on  the  use  of chemical  agents  are  to  account  for  the  approximate \nquantities  expended  by  stating  how  much  was  used  (i.e.,  |  second,  2  second  burst, \netc.).  An  auditable  system  will  be  in  place  to  compare  the  reported  quantity  used \nwith  the  actual  quantity  used  as  determined  through  weighing  or  measuring \nseconds  of discharge  remaining  upon  return  of the  canister. \ne  Use  of Force  reports  are  to  identify  the  identification  number  of the  launcher  used \nand  the  person  to  whom  the  launcher  was  issued. \ne  Information  in  use  of force  reports  and  inventories  involving  the  use  of chemical  agents \nwill be  monitored  closely  to  identify  underreported,  unauthorized  or  excessive  use. \nThis  pilot  project  will  start  in  September  2006  and  run  for  six  months  at  a  facility  to  be  selected \nwith  the  approval  of plaintiff’s  counsel.  At  the  end  of this  pilot  project,  a  determination  will  be \nmade  whether  to  use  this  system  at  other  DJJ  facilities,  test  or  implement  an  alternative  system, \nor  discontinue  the  pilot  project  due  to  lack  of material  benefit.  This  determination,  and \nidentification  of an  alternative  system,  if necessary,  will  be  made  by  DJJ  in  consultation  with, \nand  subject  to  the  approval  of,  plaintiff's  counsel. \nAccommodations  in  the  Use  of Force  for  Mentally  and  Physically  Ill Youth \nUnder  situations  where  an  immediate  use  of force  is  unnecessary,  DJJ  policy  will  include  special \nprocedures  and/or  alternative  interventions  to  protect  youth  whose  medical  or  mental  health \ncondition  indicates  the  use  of certain  types  of force  are  contraindicated.  For  example,  because  of \nPage  26\npotential  medical  complications,  oleoresin  capsicum  spray  should  not  be  used  on  youth  who  are \non  psychotropic  agents.  Youth  with  severe  asthma,  chronic  heart  conditions,  or  who  are  seizure \nprone  are  other  examples  where  use  of force  methods  must  take  into  account  the  youth’s  medical \ncondition.  In  addition,  some  individuals  who  are  very  aggressive,  agitated,  intoxicated,  or  suffer \nfrom  a  severe  mental  illness  may  have  altered  perceptions  and  responses  to  pain  and  therefore \nmay  not  respond  as  desired  and  may  become  more  agitated  by  exposure.  Policy  regarding \naccommodations  in  the  use  of force  for  mentally  and  physically  ill  youth  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation  with  the  Medical  Director  and  Chief Psychiatrist. \nDJJ  willimmediately  implement  a  system  to recognize  and  identify  any  youth  with  medical  or \nmental  health  conditions  that  might  preclude  the  use  of  some  types  of use  of force  or  restraint \nand  communicate  this  information  to  prevent  exposure  to  control  methods  that  are  contra- \nindicated. \nThe  Medical  Director  and/or  Chief Psychiatrist  for  DJJ  will  develop  a  policy/procedure  outlining \na  process  of communication  and  documentation  to  ensure  that  healthcare  and/or  mental  health \nprofessionals  indicate  if any  use  of force is  not  appropriate  for  a  specific  youth.  This  information \nwill  be  provided  to  the  unit  staff and  Duty  Lieutenant  who  will  be  responsible  for  obtaining  this \ninformation  prior  to  a  controlled  use  of force. \nUse  of Force  Training \nTraining  on  the  continuum  of interventions  and  Use  of Force  policy  and  procedures  is  required \nof all  direct  care  staff.  DJJ  will  qualify  at  least  18  staff as  trainers  by  a  crisis  management \norganization  and/or  hire  an  outside  organization  to  provide  this  training  to  all  direct  care  staff. \nThe  organization  used  or  hired  will  be  selected  by  mutual  agreement  of the  parties.  This  training \nwill  be  competency  based  and  require  a  testing  method  to  determine  the  employee’s  retention  of \ninformation  and  mastery  of the  skills  being  taught. \nYouth  Gangs \nThe  primary  driver  of youth  initiated  violence  in  DJJ  facilities  is  gang  culture  and  racial \nanimosity.  In  an  attempt  to  lessen  gang  and  racial  violence,  some  youth  have  been  separated \nthrough  facility  or  living  unit  assignments,  based  on  gang  affiliation.  Rather  than  reducing  gang \nviolence,  this  has  tended  to  increase  gang  control. \nIf DJJ  is  to  regain  control  of its  facilities  and  become a  truly  rehabilitative  agency,  gang \nmembership  must  cease  to  be  a  dominant  factor  in  DJJ  youth  culture.  Because  of the  potential  for \ntemporary  increases  in  violence,  reintegration  must  be  done  in  a  careful  and  deliberate  fashion. \nDJJ  will  consult  with  nationally  recognized  experts  to  assist  in  design,  development  and \nimplementation  of strategies  and  procedures  to  integrate  gangs  and  racial  groups  and  to  reduce \ngang  and  racial  violence.  Specific  training  in  these  strategies  and  procedures  will  be  developed \nand  provided  to  all  line  staff and  managers  involved  in  their  implementation. \nThe  Effect  of Smaller  Living  Unit  Size \nThere  is  evidence  in  DJJ  that  making  smaller  living  units  can,  by  itself,  reduce  levels  of violence. \nIn  September  2005,  DJJ  began  to  reduce  the  size  of living  units  at  Chaderjian  by  significantly \nreducing  intake  at  that  facility.  By  early  2006  all but  two  of the  living  units  had  only  24  youth. \nStaffing  levels  were  not  changed.  Taking  into  account  the  lower population  levels  and  comparing \nPage  27\nthe  five  months  prior  to  the  population  reduction  to  the  five  months  after  the  start  of the \nreduction,  the  data show  that  serious  incidents  of youth-on- youth  violence  (DDMS  Level  3)  went \ndown  17  percent;  group  disturbances  went  down  more  than  80  percent;  assaults  on  staff \ndecreased  76  percent;  incidents  involving  the  use  of force  decreased  by  24  percent;  and  use  of \nrestraints  went  down  nearly  45  percent. \nThese  changes  are  illustrated  in  the  following  graphs. \nMeasures  of  Violence  and  Use  of  Force  at  Chaderjian \nBefore  and  After  Reducing  Population  Levels \nAssaults on  Staff  per  100  Days of  Youth  Confinement \n  \n0.051 \n  \n  \n        \nGassings  Batteries  Total \n  \n|  mApril  -  Aug  m Sept  -  Jan  | \n  \nYouth  on  Youth  Batteries  and  Group  Disturbances \nper  100  Days  of Youth  Confinement \n0.14 \n0.12 \n0.10 \n0.08 \n0.06 \n0.04 \n0.02 \n0.00 \nYouth  on  Youth  Batteries  Group  Disturbances \n m April  -  Au g  m Sept  -  Jan \n  \nPage  28\nUse  of Force  and  Use  of Restraints” \nper  100  Days  of Youth  Confinement \n1.2 \n  \n1.0    0.969 \n0.8    \n0.538 \n0.6    \n     \n0.4    \n0.253  0.192 \n0.2  ~——    \n0.0 |  LL  ia    \nUse  of  Force  Use  of  Restraints \nApril  -  Aug  mSept  -  Jan \nThese  improvements  are  impressive,  but  what  they  indicate  is  a  reduction  of violence —  not  the \nrehabilitation  of youth.  Reducing  unit  population  levels  is  necessary  but  must  be  combined  with \nother rehabilitative  measures  to  make  reform  possible. \nCustody  Classification \nThe  first  principle  of risk  management  within  correctional  facilities  is  to  identify  those \nindividuals  who  have  already  posed  a  significant risk  or  who,  based  on  objective  factors,  appear \nto  be  at  a  higher  risk  of institutional  behavior  that  threatens  others  or  the  orderly  operation  of the \nfacility.  These  individuals  should  receive  special  attention  to  control  the  risk  they  pose.  Control \nis  accomplished  by  separation,  features  of facility  design  (such  as  single  room  housing), \nsupervision  (such  as  higher  staff to  youth  ratios)  and  program  design  (such  as  treatment  targeted \nat  aggressive  behavior). \nRisk  Assessment  Processes  and  Instruments \nA  preliminary  risk  assessment  instrument  to  measure  institutional  risk  at  commitment  was \ndeveloped  by  DJJ  research  staff and  reviewed  by  Chris  Baird,  a  national  expert  in  classification \nand  assessment  and  one  of the  experts  who  assisted  DJJ  with  this  Remedial  Plan.  Following  his \nreview,  Mr.  Baird  expressed  support  for  DJJ’s  use  of the  instrument  for  initial  custody \nclassification.  He  found  that  it  based  initial  custody  level  on  factors  demonstrably  related  to \ninstitutional  behavior. \nIn  June  2006,  DJJ  began  implementing  the  interim  custody  classification  plan  devised  in \nconsultation  with  experts  Chris  Baird,  Barry  Krisberg  and  Christopher  Murray.  Under  this \ninterim  plan,  DJJ  is  using  the  initial  classification  instrument  and  certain  reclassification  factors \nto  identify  youth  who  pose  a  high  risk  to  others  and  thereby  separate  them  from  low  and \nmoderate  risk  youth. \n  \n* Use  of restraints  is  generally considered to be  a type  of use  of force.  Use  of restraints  is  shown  separately in this \nchart for purposes  of illustration.  The Use  of Restraints portion of the chart is based  on a count of Use  of Restraint \nReports  during the  time periods  indicated.  The Use  of Force portion is based  on counts  of all  other reported uses  of \n  \nforce. \nPage  29\nDJJ  will  use  this  initial  custody  classification  instrument  for  custody  classification  of males  at \nfirst  commitment  and  after  parole  revocation  until such  time  that  it  demonstrates  to  the \nsatisfaction  of the  relevant  Consent  Decree  expert  that  it  has  a  new  process  or  instrument  as \ndescribed  in  the  following  paragraph  that  is  equal  or  superior  to  this  initial  custody  classification \ninstrument  at  predicting  institutional  misconduct. \nDJJ  will  develop  a  custody  reclassification  process,  including  a  reclassification  instrument, \nwhich  gives  significant  weight  to  actual  institutional  behavior  in  establishing  a  youth’s  custody \nlevel.  If necessary,  a  separate  reclassification  instrument  will  be  developed  for parole  violators. \nLike the  initial  custody  classification  instrument,  the  reclassification  instrument(s)  will  be  short \nand  easy  for  those  responsible  for  custody  classification  to  administer  and  interpret.  The \neffectiveness  of this  instrument  will  be  analyzed  and  validated  (or revised  as  necessary)  after  a \ntime  period  to  be  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan. \nUsing  this  custody  reclassification  instrument,  youth  will  be  periodically  reclassified  for \ninstitutional  risk  based  on  their  expected  length  of  stay  in  DJJ  facilities.  For  youth  expected  to \nstay  less  than  13  months,  reclassification  will  be  done  at  least  quarterly.  For  youth  expected  to  be \nin  DJJ  facilities  for  a  longer period  of time,  reclassification  will  take  place  at  least  once  every  six \nmonths.  Custody  reassessments  will  also  be  incident  driven  as  determined  by  DJJ  policy  which \nwill  be  developed  in  consultation  with,  and  the  approval  of,  the  relevant  Safety  and  Welfare \nConsent  Decree  Expert. \nIn  the  future,  DJJ  will  have  an  integrated  risk/needs  assessment  process  that  will  result  in \nplacements  based  on  risks  (in  the  community,  of recidivism  and  to  others  in  an  institutional \nsetting)  and  program  needs.  Part  of the  implementation  of risk/needs  assessment  will  include  a \nvalidation  process.  DJJ  may  replace  its  interim  custody  risk  classification/reclassification  process \nand  instruments  with  an  integrated  risks/needs  assessment  process  when  it  demonstrates  that  the \ninstruments  are  equal  or  superior  to  those  being  replaced  in  predicting  institutional  misconduct.  It \nwill  keep  plaintiffs’  counsel,  the  relevant  Consent  Decree  experts  and  the  Special  Master  advised \nof its  progress  in  developing  the  integrated  assessment  process  and  instruments  with  sufficient \nnotice  to  permit  invocation  of the  Consent  Decree  dispute  resolution  procedure  over  whether  the \nproposed  integrated  risk/needs  assessment  process  and  instruments  are  equal  or  superior  in \nproviding  for  institutional  safety to  the  processes  and  instruments  being  replaced. \nAssignment  to  Living  Units \n  \nUnless  there  are  specific  programmatic  reasons  supported  by  the  DJJ  Integrated \nTreatment/Rehabilitative  Model  indicating  otherwise,  male  youth  classified  as  high  risk  for \ninstitutional  violence  through  the  initial  custody  classification  instrument,  the  custody \nreclassification  process,  or  the  interim  classification  plan  will  be  separated  from  youth  classified \nas  low  risk.  Moderate  risk  youth  will  be  placed  as  appropriate  by  the  classification  tool.  Because \nthey  have  higher  staff to  youth  ratios  and  use  single  rooms,  this  restriction  will  not  apply  to \nmental  health  units,  sex  behavior treatment units,  and  intake  units.  DJJ  will  develop  a  policy  to \nallow  out-of-level  placement  for  specific  programmatic  reasons  supported  by  the  DJJ  Integrated \nTreatment  Model.  This  policy  will  include  required  documentation  and  headquarters  review. \nHousing  youth  with  high  institutional  risk  in  dormitories,  if necessary,  will  be  temporary.  These \ndormitories  will  operate  only  until  such  time  as  they  are  replaced  by  new  construction  or  the \nPage  30\nopening  of other  suitable  single-room  living  units.  Until  replaced,  dormitories  with  high  risk \nyouth  will be  operated  in  ways  designed  to  reduce  overall  levels  of violence.  Levels  of violence \nwill  be  monitored  as  described  below  under  “Performance  Measures  for  Custody  Classification.” \nIf levels  of violence  in  high  risk  dormitories  do  not  meet  the targets  set  by  these  performance \nmeasures,  DJJ  will  implement  alternative  risk  management  strategies  whose  elements  and \nschedule  will  be  developed  in  consultation  with,  and  be  approved  by,  the  relevant  Safety  and \nWelfare  Consent  Decree  Expert. \nDJJ  will  provide  all  of its  program  components  to  youth  of all  risk  levels. \nPerformance  Measures  for  Custody  Classification \n  \nIn  consultation  with,  and  subject  to  the  approval  of,  the  relevant  Safety  and  Welfare  Consent \nDecree  Expert,  DJJ  will  develop  and  adopt  a  system  of performance  measures  related  to  violence \nreduction  in  its  facilities.  This  system will  specify  the  data  elements  to  be  tracked,  the  method(s) \nby  which  baselines  are  established,  and  the  target  levels  and  dates  which will  be  used  to \ndetermine  success  or  failure  in  reducing  violence. \nThis  system will  be  put  in  place  no  later than  30  days  after  DJJ  begins  using  dormitories  for  high \nrisk  youth. \nACTION  PLAN \n1.  DJJ  will  work  with  Safety  and  Welfare  Consent  Decree  Expert  Barry  Krisberg  to  develop  a \nschedule  for  implementing  the  custody  classification,  living  unit  assignment,  and \nperformance  measure  processes  described  in  this  section  by  August  1,  2006.  The  dates \nagreed  to  by  DJJ  and  Dr.  Krisberg  will  be  incorporated  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section \nof this  Remedial  Plan  which  will  be  filed  in  accordance  with  the  schedule  described  in \nSection  1. \n2.  By  a  date  to  be  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan,  DJJ \nwill  revise  the  Use  of Force  policy  as  necessary  to  be  consistent  with  this  Plan,  including \npolicies  and  procedures  relating  to  accommodations  in  the  use  of force  for  mentally  and \nphysically  ill  youth. \n3.  By  January  1,  2007,  DJJ  will  implement  the  Use  of Force  Review  Model  and  create  and \nbegin  operating  Violence  Reduction  Committees  at  each  facility. \n4.  By  July  1,  2007,  DJJ  will  qualify  at  least  18  staff  as  trainers  by  a  crisis  management \norganization  agreed  upon  by  the  plaintiff's  counsel  and/or  hire  an  outside  organization  to \nprovide  this  training  to  all  direct  care  staff.  Direct  care  staff of  at  least  two  facilities  will \nreceive  this  training  by  November  1,  2007.  Staff in  all  remaining  facilities  will  receive  this \ntraining  by  July  1,  2008. \n5.  By  January  1,  2007,  DJJ  will,  in  consultation  with  the  plaintiff's  counsel  and  the  relevant \nConsent  Decree  expert,  develop  and  adopt  a  database  to  track  all  incidences  of violence  and \nuse  of force.  DJJ  will  use  this  system  until  a  more  complete  centralized  MIS  is  implemented. \n6.  DJJ  will  implement  a  system  to  regularly  record  the  data  elements  collected  for  PbS  Safety \nOutcome  Measures  2,  3,  4,  11,  and  12  for  every  day  of the  year  by  November  1,  2006.  DJJ \nPage  31\nwill  develop  formats  and  procedures  for  reporting  results  and  share  these  quarterly  with \nplaintiffs  counsel,  the  relevant  consent  Decree  expert,  and  Special  Master  April  1,  2007. \nBy  September  2006,  DJJ  will  implement  a  six  month  pilot  program  to  monitor  the  use  of \nchemical  agents  as  described  above.  In  consultation  with,  and  subject  to  the  approval  of, \nplaintiff's  counsel,  a  determination  will  be  made  whether  to  use  this  system  at  other  DJJ \nfacilities,  test  or  implement  an  alternative  system,  or  discontinue  the  pilot  project  due  to  lack \nof material  benefit. \nDJJ  will  consult  with  a  national  expert  by  June  1,  2007  to  help  develop  by  January  1,  2008, \nstrategies  and  procedures  to  safely  integrate  gangs  and  racial  groups.  DJJ  will  provide \ntraining  in  these  strategies  and  procedures  to  all  staff involved  in  their  implementation  by \nJuly  1,  2008. \nDJJ  will  open  Behavior  Treatment  Program  units  as  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria \nSection  of this  Remedial  Plan.  DJJ  will  use  improved  data  from  the  new  assessment \ninstruments  and  process,  disciplinary  review  process,  and  monitoring  systems  established  to \nmeasure  violence  and  use  of force,  to  make  annual  estimates  of the  number  of BTP  units  that \nwill  be  needed  for  the  following  two  years.  By  July  1,  2008,  DJJ  will  have  sufficient  capacity \nin  BTPs  to  provide  treatment/rehabilitation  for  the  estimated  number  of youth  requiring  BTP \nlevel  treatment/rehabilitation  during  fiscal  year  2008-2009. \n10.  DJJ  will  consult  with  national  expert(s)  to  develop  methodology  for  training  impartial \nobservers  to  conduct  regular  surveys  of youth  and  staff using  the  PbS  Staff Climate  Survey \nand  Youth  Climate  Survey  or  similar  instruments  at  each  facility.  DJJ  will  begin  producing \ntwice  yearly  reports  on  staff and  youth  attitudes  about  facility  safety  by  a  date  to  be  specified \nin  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan.  The  sample  size  for  each  survey \nwill  be  established  by  the  national  experts  to  ensure  that  changes  observed  from  one  time \nperiod  to  the  next  are  statistically  significant  at  a  level  designated  by  the  experts. \nPage  32\nSECTION  4 \nIDENTIFY  A  REHABILITATIVE  TREATMENT  MODEL \nTHE  ISSUE \nThe  core  requirement  of the  January  31,  2005  stipulated  agreement  in  the Farrell  lawsuit  is  that \nDJJ  willreform  its  system  to  a  rehabilitative  model.  DJJ  must  clearly  define  the  model  it  will  use \nbefore  it  can  develop  and  implement  the  training  needed  to  become  a rehabilitative  agency. \nDISCUSSION \nThis  section  defines  the  components  of a  rehabilitative  model  and  outlines  a  well  documented \nand  successful  approach  used  by  one  state  that  DJJ  will  adapt  to  meet  its  needs. \nSystem  Overview \nFigure  4.1  shows  how  a  youth  committed  to  DJJ  would  move  through  a  system  that  incorporates \nall  of the  elements  of a  rehabilitative  model. \nFIGURE  4.1:  A  REHABILITATIVE  MODEL  FOR  DJJ \n  \n          |.

DJJ  is  committed  to  implementing  a  treatment/rehabilitation  program  based \non  this  approach. \nWhile  the  particulars  may  differ,  because  they  are  based  on  the  same  treatment  approach,  the \nconcepts  behind  the  treatment  model  in  states  with  successful  rehabilitative  programs  are  more \nor  less  the  same.  As  the  agency  with  the  most  fully  documented  model,  the  Integrated  Treatment \nModel  developed  by  the  Washington  State  Juvenile  Rehabilitation  Administration  (JRA)  is  used \nto  illustrate  these  concepts.  It  conceptually  unites  evidence-based  programs  in  a  coherent,  clearly \narticulated  way.  It  is  principle-based  and  open-ended.  Consequently,  this  model  can  embrace  any \nevidence-based  intervention  consistent  with  a  cognitive-behavior  model.  Because  of existing \ndocumentation,  the  model  is  replicable  and  has  existing  materials  —  including  training  materials \nand  an  implementation  plan —  that  DJJ  will  modify  and  tailor  to  its  needs. \nTreatment/Rehabilitation  is  Pervasive  and  Universal \nT he  Integrated  Treatment   Model  provides  the  central  guiding  vision  uniting  screening, \nassessment,  case  planning,  treatment/rehabilitation,  transition,  and  aftercare.  The  concepts  are \nused  across  all  parts  of the  agency—   including  the  core  treatment  program,  special  treatment \nprograms,  academic  and  vocational  education,  work,  recreation,  mental  health,  and  parole. \nAt  different  levels  of detail,  everyone —  administrators,  line  staff,  treatment/rehabilitation \nproviders,  and  support  staff —  receives  training  in  the  model.  This  not  only  structures  the \nenvironment  to  help  promote  success  in  changing  behavior,  it  also  creates  a  common  vocabulary \nfor  all  parts  of the  agency  and  facilitates  continuity  of treatment/rehabilitation  when  youth  move \nbetween  facilities  and  living  units. \nIn  DJJ,  a  comprehensive  vision  describing  such  a  model  might  be  something  like  this: \nThe  DJJ cognitive-behavioral  treatment  model pervades  every  aspect  of the  agency,  its \nfacilities  and aftercare.  Its principles  are  transparent,  effective,  recognizable,  and  universal. \nEveryone provides  treatment/rehabilitation. \nPage  34\nAssessment  and  Reassessment \nInitial  screening  is  done  to  identify  issues  requiring  further  testing  or  clinical  evaluation.  In \naddition,  everyone  receives  a  risk/needs  assessment  which,  together  with  other  testing  and \nclinical  evaluation,  identifies  issues  to  be  prioritized  for behavioral  analysis  and \ntreatment/rehabilitation  interventions. \nA  risk/needs  assessment  tool  identifies  risk  and  protective  factors  in  a  variety  of domains.  The \nfollowing  example  is  taken  from  Arizona  Department  of Juvenile  Corrections  assessment  tool.  It \nhas  12  domains.  (This  is  two  more  domains  than  the  JRA  model  which  does  not  have  a  separate \ndomain  for  sexual  offending  and  includes  aggression  under  attitudes  and  behaviors.)  The  12 \ndomains  in  the  Arizona  system  are: \nRisk  to  Reoffend  /  Criminal  History \nMedical  and  Mental  Health \nSchool \nEmployment \nFamily \nAlcohol  and  Drugs \nAggression \nSexual  Offending \nSocial  Influences \nUse  of Free  Time \nSkills \nAttitudes  /  Behaviors \nMost  of these  domains  have  both  static  and  dynamic  factors.  Static  factors  are  those  that  cannot \nbe  changed  through  any  intervention.  For  example,  it  is  a  static  risk  factor  to  have  been  the \nvictim  of sexual  abuse  or to  have  grown  up  in  an  environment  where  the  parent  or  caregiver \nrarely  responded  appropriately  to  negative  behavior.  Dynamic  factors  are  those  that  can  be \nchanged,  such  as  a  youth’s  attitudes  about  drugs  or  school  or  authority  figures.  They  can  also \ninclude  factors  over  which  other people  have  control,  like  having  pro-social  role  models. \nMost  domains  have  both  risk  and  protective  factors.  For  example,  a  history  of being  expelled \nfrom  school  is  a  risk  factor,  but  having  positive  school  experiences  or  rapport  with  teachers  are \nprotective  factors.  Being  fired  from  work  or  having  uninvolved  parents  are  risk  factors,  but  pro- \nsocial  work  experiences  or  caring  parents  are  protective  factors. \nIn  this  kind  of assessment,  skills  refer  to  personal  or  social  skills  such  as  the  ability  to  control \nimpulses  or  tolerate  frustration.  Defined  this  way,  all  skills  are  dynamic  factors  and  mitigate  risk. \nIn  an  integrated  system,  the  same  instrument  used  for  initial  assessment  is  used  for re- \nassessment.  Reassessments  only  address  dynamic  factors.  They  measure  the  progress  (or  lack  of \nprogress)  of  an  individual  against  all  changeable  factors  in  all  domains.  This  provides  objective \nfeedback  on  how  well  a  youth  is  doing.  Taken  in  aggregate,  reassessments  provide  insight  into \nthe effectiveness  of a  particular  intervention  in  strengthening  the  protective  factors  and/or \nameliorating  the  risk  factors  that  are  the  intended  targets  of the  intervention. \nPage  35\nAs  this  Plan  is  implemented,  part  of the  assessment  may  be  done  at  a  regional  reception  center \nand  the  remainder  after  the  youth  has  been  transferred  to  a  facility. \nDifferent  people  may  be  responsible  for  different  parts  of the  assessment.  For  example,  someone \nfrom  parole  may  be  assigned  the  responsibility  for  doing  assessment  and  reassessment  in  the \nFamily  Domain;  someone  from  education  may  be  assigned  the  School  Domain.  Those \nindividuals  who  do  the  reassessments  can  constitute  the  multi-disciplinary  team  that  periodically \nmeets  to  review  a  youth’s  progress  and  adjust  his  or  her  treatment/rehabilitation  plan \naccordingly. \nFigure  4.2  shows  how  this  system  works.  The  domains,  domain  names,  locations  where  initial \nassessment  takes  place,  and  the  people  assigned  to  each  domain  are for  illustration purposes \nonly.  It  is  the  concepts  that  are  important.  DJJ  will  adapt  this  system  to  its  own  needs. \nIt  should  be  noted  that  Figure  4.2  also  includes  initial  assessment  and  reassessment  for  custody \nclassification.  Custody  classification/reclassification  will  be  conducted  and  used  as  described  in \nSection  3,  “Reduce  Violence  and  Fear.” \nPage  36\nFIGURE  4.2:  AN  INTEGRATED  APPROACH  TO  ASSESSMENT  &  REASSESSMENT \nInitial  assessment  evaluates  static  and  Reassessment  measures  changes  in \ndynamic  risk  and  protective  factors  dynamic  risk  and  protective  factors \nla \n  \nINITIAL  ASSESSMENT  +) \nAT  RECEPTION  ASSESSMENT  DOMAINS \nc   \\ \nCUSTODY  REQUIREMENTS \nBy classification  By classification \nStatic  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \nNX  S \n  \n{   \nREASSESSMENT  BY  TREATMENT  TEAM \nRISK  TO  RE-OFFEND \nBy  reception  By Case  Manager \nStatic  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \nMEDICAL/MENTAL  HEALTH \nBy  medical  & mental  health  By  medical  & mental  health \nStatic  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \nSCHOOL \nBy education     By education \nStatic  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \nEMPLOYMENT \nBy education  By education \nStatic  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \n(To be determined based  SEXUAL  OFFENDING  (To be determined  based \non selected  assessment tool)  ;  ;  on selected  assessment tool) \n   Static  Factors  Dynamic  Factors    \n\\  / \n(     ’    \nINITIAL  ASSESSMENT  BY  TREATMENT  TEAM \nFAMILY \nBy  Re-entry Specialist / Parole  By  Re-entry Specialist / Parole \nStatic  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \nAQEIFIES TOT  By Case  Manager \nBy Case  Manager  Static  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \nSOCIAL  INFLUENCES \nBy Case  Manager  By Case  Manager \nStatic  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \n  \nUSE  OF  FREE  TIME \nBy Case  Manager  By Case  Manager \nStatic  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \nSKILLS \nBy Case  Manager  By Case  Manager \nStatic  Factors  Dynamic  Factors \nATTITUDES  /  BEHAVIORS \nBy Case  Manager  By Case  Manager \nStatic  Factors  L  Dynamic  Factors \n\\  ZL  y, \n  \nPage  37\nValidity  of Assessment  Instruments \n  \nThe  primary  outcome  variable  that  DJJ  is  trying  to  influence  through  its  rehabilitative  model  is \nfuture  criminal  behavior.  The  assessment  and  reassessment  model  described  here  only  works  if \nthe  items  assessed  and  scored  are  truly  predictive  of risk  and  protective  factors  correlated  with \nfuture  criminal  behavior.  Such  assessment  tools  cannot  be  constructed  in  an  arbitrary way  or  by \nvote  of a  committee.  Questions  must  be  developed  based  on  research  findings  and  scoring  values \n(weights)  for  each  question  established  through  a  validation  study  by  a  competent  researcher. \nDJJ  will  contract  for  a  risk  needs  assessment  and  ensure that  a  validation  study  is  conducted \nbased  on  the  population  it  serves  and  adjustments  are  made  accordingly. \nCase  Management  Planning \n  \nFor  each  area  in  which  treatment/rehabilitation  services  are  indicated  —  either by  court  order, \nparole  condition,  or  assessed  need —  the  treatment  team  will  prioritize  the  targets  for \ntreatment/rehabilitation  and  develop  an  individualized  case  plan  based  on  the  youths’  goals  for \nthe  future,  motivation  for  change,  strengths,  skills,  and  risks  related  to  re-offense.  Periodic \nreassessments  will  be  conducted  and  modifications  to  the  plan  will  be  made  as  necessary. \nDJJ  will  establish  a  method  to  document  the  treatment/rehabilitation  needs  of youth  upon  their \nentry  to  the  system  and  update  this  upon  reassessment.  In  the  long  term,  this  system  will  be \nelectronic.  DJJ  will  use  aggregate  information  from  this  system  to  identify  aggregate  treatment \nneeds,  trends,  and  to  plan  for  future  services. \nThe  case  management  plan  will  include  elements  that  are  not  specifically  cognitive-behavioral \ntreatment  including  academic  and  vocational  education,  work  experience  and  work  skills \ntraining,  and  asset-based  programs  related  to  interests  and  abilities  in  music,  literacy,  culture,  art, \nleadership,  recreational  activities,  etc. \nTreatment/Rehabilitation  Planning \nAn  individualized  treatment/rehabilitation  plan  is  developed  for  each  youth  and  regularly \nupdated.  The  plan  should  include  identification  and  prioritization  of the  issues  for  which  the \nyouth  needs  services. \nA  central  feature  of the  Integrated  Treatment  Model  is  the  use  of behavioral  analysis  in  planning \nfor  treatment/rehabilitation.  Behavioral  analysis  has  a  long  history  as  a  research  and  assessment \ntool  in  psychology.  It  examines  the  links  in  the  behavior  chain,  which  are: \nPre-existing  risk  factors \nCues \nEmotions \nCognitive  distortions  (“thinking  errors’’) \nBehavioral  responses \nOutcomes  that  reinforce  the  behavior \nFigure  4.3  illustrates  the  links  in  the  behavior  chain. \nPage  38\nFIGURE  4.3:  THE  BEHAVIOR  CHAIN \n(Adapted from JRA Integrated  Treatment Model,  September 2002) \n     \nPre-existing  Emotions  Cognitive  PROBLEM  Outcomes \nrisk factors  distortions  BEHAVIOR \nBehavioral  analysis  is  used  to  discover  what  the  youth’s  problem  is  and  to  understand  how  the \nproblem  behavior  the  youth  engages  in  “solves”  the  problem  from  the  youth’s  perspective.  Once \nthe  purpose  of the  problem  behavior  is  understood,  staff and  the  youth  can  begin  to  develop  a \nplan  that  attempts  to  break  the  behavior  chain  at  multiple  points. \nThe  Treatment/Rehabilitation  Hierarchy \nVirtually  all  youth  committed  to  DJJ  have  multiple  problems.  While  more  than  one  problem  can \nbe  worked  on  at  a  time,  it  may  be  necessary,  based  on  circumstances,  to  prioritize  what  will  be \naddressed.  The  following  is  an  example  of a  system  to  prioritize  targets  of intervention.  DJJ  will \ndevelop  a  process  to  prioritize  treatment/rehabilitation  needs. \nSample  Treatment/Rehabilitation  Hierarchy \ne  self-injurious  behavior, \naggressive  behavior, \nescape  ideation,  threats  or behavior, \ntreatment-interfering  behavior, \nresearch-based  risk  and  protective  factors  relating  to  recidivism \nsignificant  quality  of life issues” \nTreatment \nCognitive-behavioral  treatment  includes  a  wide  variety  of interventions  which  are  applicable  to \nsome,  or  multiple,  parts  of the  behavior  chain.  The  treatment/rehabilitation  plan  identifies  the \nproblem  behavior(s)  and  the  links  in  the  behavior  chain  where  interventions  should  have  the  best \nresults.  The  treatment/rehabilitation  hierarchy  identifies  which  problems  are  to  be  addressed  first. \nThus,  for  example,  if a  youth  has  aggressive  behavior  that  is  linked  to  severe  anxiety  and  fear, \nthe  treatment/rehabilitation  plan  would  include  interventions  related  to  emotions.  Examples  of \nthese  are  exposure-based  interventions  and  skills  training  in  emotional  regulation  and  distress \ntolerance.  If  something  in  the  current  environment  “solves”  the  problem  from  the  youth’s  point \nof view  but  does  nothing  to  remove  the  problem  behavior,  then  interventions  addressing  the \noutcomes  portion  of the  behavior  chain  are  needed.  Many  types  of interventions  are  available  for \nsuch  situations.  The  term  used  in  cognitive-behavioral  treatment  for  this  collection  of \ninterventions  is  “contingency  management.” \nMost  cognitive-behavioral  interventions  involve  the  teaching  of  skills.  In  the  JRA  model,  skills \ndeficits  are  addressed  following a  decision  tree  as  illustrated  in Figure  4.4.  (It  should  be  noted \n  \n° Quality of life issues include  such things  as being homeless,  being unemployed or unable  to  maintain employment, \nbeing  expelled from school,  lacking  friends  or having inconsistent relationships,  having  excessive unstructured time, \nhaving  anti-social peers,  etc.  Most of these  elements  are  correlated  with recidivism. \nPage  39\nthat  any  appropriate  evidence-based  cognitive-behavioral  intervention  can  be  substituted  for \nthose  listed  here.) \nFIGURE  4.4:  CBT  SKILLS  DEFICIT  DECISION  TREE \n(Adapted from JRA Integrated  Treatment Model,  September 2002) \n     \nDoes  the  youth  have  No \n   Teach  the  skill \nthe  skill?       \n  \n         \nWhy  is  the  skill  not \nbeing  used? \n  \n    Yes   Use  CBT  Continge ncy  Management \nVulnerabilities?  techniques,  pharmacology,  problem- \n     \nsolving  and  self-care  skills \n  \n    Yes   Use  Exposure-bas ed  or  Emotion- \nEmotions?  change  interventions;  teach  Emotion \n     \nRegulation  &  Distress  Tolerance  skills \n    \n  \n   Cognitive   Use  Cognitive  Restructuring \n   \n distorti ons?      interventions  &  Problem-solving  skills    \n  \n  \nHabits?

The  original \nconcepts  were  developed  for  chronically  suicidal  women  and  can  be  applied  in  gender  specific \nand  culturally  relevant  ways.  The  model  can  also  be  used  in  parole. \nTraining \nTraining  in  the  Integrated  Treatment  Model  is  provided  to  all  staff at  different  levels  of intensity. \n  \nFor  example,  JRA  has  developed  initial  training  materials  for  residential  and  line  staff that  focus \nOn: \nPage 40\n    \n  \nCognitive-behavior  treatment  overview \nBehavior  modification  components \nInteractive  behavioral  analysis \nTreatment/rehabilitation  hierarchy \nTreatment/rehabilitation  planning \nIn-depth  skill  set  overview \nCognitive-behavioral  Treatment  documentation \nThe  JRA  training  module  for  managers  is  a  16  hour  course  that  includes  all  of the  above.  Support \nstaff receive  four  hours  of audio-visual  training  that  includes  a  brief overview  of behavior \nmodifications  components  and  cognitive-behavioral  research,  treatment/rehabilitation  planning, \nand  cognitive-behavioral  treatment  documentation.  Line  staff receive  more  intensive  training \nplus  on-going  coaching  from,  and  consultation  with,  clinical  psychologists  who  are  specialists  in \ncognitive-behavioral  treatment. \ne  ca \nRe-entry  planning  will  begin  at  the  onset  of the  youth’s  arrival  at  the  reception  center  and \ncontinue  throughout  the  facility  placement.  The  individual  treatment/rehabilitation  plan  will \ninclude  a  re-entry  component  that  will  be  periodically  updated  with  input  from  the  Re-Entry \nSpecialist  and  community  Parole  Agents. \nTransition  services  are  more  fully  discussed  in  Section  6,  “Convert  Facilities  to  Rehabilitative \nModel.”  Aftercare  is  discussed  in  Section  8,  “Other  Issues.” \nAsaa  R4N  r yore 4 Se&S   QP SRT  TSE  AAT \n1.  DJJ  will  issue  an  RFP  for  a  risk/needs  assessment  tool  by  October  1,  2006.  As  living  units \nare  converted  to  the  reform  model,  all  case  managers,  casework  specialists,  and  other  staff \ninvolved  in  risk/needs  assessment  will  be  trained  in  use  of the  instrument. \n2.  Consistent  with  the  implementation  schedules  in  Section  5,  “Lay  the  Foundation  for \nTreatment  Reform,”  DJJ  will  consult  with  experts  in  cognitive-behavioral  treatment  for \njuvenile  offenders  to  adapt  the  Washington  Integrated  Treatment  Model  to  the  needs  of DJJ \nwith  specific  emphasis  on  modifications  needed  for: \nOlder  youth \nGang  involved  youth \nYouth  with  racist  attitudes  and  behaviors \nAny  other  area  DJJ  deems  necessary \n3.  DJJ  will  produce  a  written  description  and  manual  for  its  adopted  treatment/rehabilitation \nmodel  consistent  with  implementation  schedules  in  Section  5,  “Lay  the  Foundation  for \nTreatment  Reform.” \nPage  41\nSection  4  of this  plan  defines  the  core  elements  and  principles  behind  the  rehabilitative  model \nwhich  DJJ  will  employ.  Turning  this  definition  into  actual  programs  that  DJJ  can  implement  will \nrequire  a  great  deal  of work.  This  includes  hiring  of experts  to  assist  with  program  development \nand  training;  obtaining  and  implementing  a  risk/needs  assessment  tool;  fleshing  out  the  details  of \nthe  core  program  and  the  behavior  treatment  program;  developing  training  curricula  and  training \ntrainers;  reconciling  the  Safety  and  Welfare  Plan  with  other  Remedial  Plans;  revising  existing \npolicies  and  procedures  and  developing  new  ones;  and  creating  new  or  modifying  existing job \nclassifications. \nIf DJJ  were  implementing  reform  in  a  logical  step-wise  fashion,  all  of the  elements  described  in \nthe  first  paragraph  of this  section  would  be  in  place  before  DJJ  rolled  out  the  treatment/ \nrehabilitation  model  a  few  living  units  at  a  time.  Instead,  because  of the  urgency  of the  situation \nand  the  timing  of appropriations,  DJJ  will  start  rolling  out  smaller,  fully-staffed  living  units \nbefore  all  elements  of the  treatment/rehabilitation  model  are  in  place.  As  elements  of the  model \nbecome  fully developed,  future  living  units  will  open  (or  be  converted)  with  those  elements  in \nplace  and  staff working  in  previously  opened  or  converted  units  will  be  trained  to  operate  their \nunits  using  newly  learned  procedures  and  skills. \nWhile  not  ideal,  as  discussed  in  Section  3,  “Reduce  Violence  and  Fear,”  simply  making  living \nunits  smaller  and  improving  the  ratio  of staff to  youth  will  be  a  significant  step  forward.  Only  as \nstaff are  trained  in  the  fully  developed  treatment/rehabilitation  model  will  DJJ  truly  be  able \noperate  as  a  rehabilitative  agency.  Full  implementation  of this  plan  will  take  a  great  deal  of time, \neffort  and  money. \nAS Yo N“ rerer   ies  rt pnw IP a  jpowe 4 A \nIn  order  to  lay  the  foundation  for  treatment/rehabilitation  reform,  DJJ  must: \n1.

DJJ  will  do  this \nover  the  next  four  years.  This  section  describes  the  types  of treatment/rehabilitation  programs \nthat  will  occur  in  these  living  units  and  presents  the  schedule  for  their  implementation. \na) DISCUSSr, Hi 1 Ipore OCo N \nAs  a  rehabilitative  agency,  DJJ  will  have  two  types  of core  treatment  programs:  a  rehabilitative \ntreatment  program  for  most  youth  and  a  behavior  treatment  program  for  aggressive  youth \nwithout  significant  mental  health  problems.  In  addition,  there  will  be  intensive  treatment \nprograms  for  youth  with  significant  mental  health  issues.  DJJ  will  provide  all  treatment/ \nrehabilitation  services,  including  sexual  behavior  and  substance  abuse  treatment,  at  all  levels  as \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  all  youth  identified  as  needing  such  services  receive  them  without \nhaving  their  parole  consideration  delayed  because  the  program  was  not  available  to  them. \nMost treatment/rehabilitation  services  are  provided  at  the  living  unit  level.  These  services  will  be \nsupported  by  various  positions  at  each  facility.  These  include: \ne  Program  Manager(s)  responsible  for  high-risk,  low-risk,  and  re-entry  programs  as \nneeded. \ne  Volunteer  Services  Coordinator/Positive  Incentives  Coordinator \nVocational  Specialist  to  provide  vocational  and  career  counseling  and  coordination  with \nparole  and  re-entry  specialists \nVictim  Services/Restitution  Specialist \nTraining  officer \nConflict  resolution  team(s) \nWork  Assignment  Coordinator  to  seek  out  and  develop  work  assignments  for  youth \nthroughout  the  facility,  monitor  and  assure  that the  maximum  number  of youth  are \nattending  Free  Venture  programs,  and  coordinate  and  develop  external job  assignments, \nwork  experience  programs,  and job  furlough programs. \ne  Facility  administrators  responsible  for  each  of the  following  areas:  operations,  programs, \nand  business  services. \nOther  facility-wide  program  services  (education,  medical,  dental,  mental  health,  and  sex \nbehavior  treatment)  are  described  in  the  Education  Remedial  Plan,  the  Health  Care  Services \nRemedial  Plan,  the  Mental  Health  Remedial  Plan,  and  the  Sexual  Behavior  Remedial Plan. \nThe Prog gram  Service2   Day  is  a  coordinated  schedule  for  each  facility  and  the  programs  it \noperates.  The  intent  is  to  provide  flexibility in  scheduling  youth  into  school,  individual \ncounseling,  groups,  case  conferences,  and  the  like,  during  hours  when  program  staff are  on  duty. \nThe  “Program  Service  Day”  is  intended  to  minimize  conflicts  while  ensuring  that  youth  receive \nnecessary  treatment/rehabilitation  services  and  are  constructively  active  during  most  of their \nPage  44\nwaking  hours.  Although  treatment  may  be  incorporated  into  regular  education  curriculum, \nstudents  will  not  ordinarily  be  removed  from  education  for  scheduled  treatment/rehabilitation \nServices. \nAs  necessary  to  provide  treatment/rehabilitation  services,  supervision  and  support services  and  to \nensure  that  youth  are  constructively  active  for  most  of their  waking  hours,  DJJ  will  ensure  that \ncoverage  by  every  discipline —  including  psychologists,  case  managers,  teachers,  and  other \nservice  providers  —  includes  some  evening  and  weekend  time.  The  Program  Service  Day \nschedule  does  not  have  to  be  identical  at  each  facility,  but  must  be  consistent  with  minimum \nrequirements  for  program  access  as  established  by  central  office.  The  administrator  for  programs \nat  each  facility  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  development  of the  Program  Service  Day \nschedule  for  the  facility  that  is  consistent  with  these  requirements.  Schedules  will  be  developed \nin  consultation  with  each  of the  program  disciplines. \nEach  youth  will  also  have  an  individual  schedule  coordinated  with  the  Program  Service  Day \nschedule  to  ensure  that  he/she  will  be  able  to  participate  in  all  required  activities  with  minimum \ndisruption  to  the  school  schedule  or  other  mandated  activity.  The  youth’s  Case  Manager  will  be \nresponsible  for coordinating  development  of his  or  her  individual  schedule. \nCore  Rehabilitation/Treatment  Program \nDJJ  will  establish  core  treatment  programs  to  replace  existing  general  population  units.  The \nprogram  in  these  units  will  be  based  on  DJJ’s  adaptation  of the Integrated  Treatment  Model  as \ndescribed  in  Section  4,  “A  Rehabilitative  Treatment  Model.”  The  DJJ  Integrated  Treatment \nModel  may  be  supported  by  any  or  all  of the  following  components: \nRisk  Needs  Assessment \nMotivational  Interviewing \nNormative  Culture \nInteractive  Journaling \nIntensive  Needs  Curriculum  (in  development  by  The  Change  Company)  -  content  to \ninclude  anger  management,  criminal  thinking  and  behavior,  parenting,  exiting  gangs, \nvictim  empathy,  coping  with  trauma,  and  alternatives  to  violence \ne  Strategies  for  Juvenile  Supervision/Client  Management  Classification \ne  Additional  cognitive  behavioral  interventions  as  identified  in  consultation  with  court  and \nnationally  recognized  experts  —  especially  in  the  areas  of violence  reduction,  gang \nintegration,  substance  abuse/dependence,  normative  culture,  and  gender  specific \nprograms  for  females. \nPlacement  in  a  Core  Program  Unit \nUnless  a  youth  is  identified  as  having  special  needs  (e.g.  mental  health),  he  or  she  will  be \nassigned  to  an  appropriate  core  treatment/rehabilitation  program  consistent  with  his  or  her \ncustody  classification  as  described  in  Section  3,  “Reduce  Violence  and  Fear.”  The  initial \nplacement  decision  is  overseen  by  central  classification  while  the  youth  is  at  the  reception  center. \nStaffing  Standards  for  Core  Program  Units \nI n  existing  living  units   converted  to  the  Core  Rehabilitation/Treatment  Program  there  will  be  no \nmore  than  36  to  38  youth  per  living  unit.  These  units  will  have  the  following  coverage: \nPage  45\n.)  Clinical  Psychologist \n.)  Treatment  Team  Supervisor \n2  Case  Managers \n1  Senior  Youth  Correctional  Counselor \n3  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  on  the  second  watch \n3  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  on  the  third  watch \n1  Youth  Correctional  Officer  on  the  first  watch \n.)  Re-entry  Specialist \nThese  staffing  standards  are  for  use  in  converted  existing  living  units  until  such  time  as  they  are \nreplaced  by  new  construction.  Planning  for  new  facilities  and  new  living  units  will  take  place \nthrough  the  Juvenile  Justice  Operational  Master  Plan  and  the  Facilities  Master Plan  discussed  in \nSection  8  of this  document.  Living  unit  size  in  new  facilities  for  core  program  units  will  be \nguided  by  national  standards  for juvenile  correctional  facilities  and  the  risks  and  needs  of the \npopulation  and  will  be  in  the  range  of  16  to  25  youth  for  general  core  program  living  units. \nLiving  units  for  special  populations  will  be  smaller.  The  size  of units  for  special  populations  will \nbe  guided  by  national  standards  for juvenile  correctional  facilities  and,  if  standards  are  not \navailable,  the recommendations  of national  experts. \nCore  Program  Treatment  Team \n  \nLiving  units  will  operate  under  the  unit  team  concept. \nThe  Treatment  Team  Supervisor  is  responsible  for  supervision  of two  core  program  units.  This \nperson  provides  oversight  of the  daily  operations  of the  living  units,  including  staff supervision, \nscheduling,  discipline,  grievances,  and  reports.  This  person  is  the  primary  liaison  between  the \nliving  units  and  upper-level  institutional  management. \nThe  Clinical  Psychologist  provides  outpatient  mental  health  services  for  youth  in  two  core \nprogram  units.  These  psychologists  also  provide  training,  coaching  and  consultation  in  cognitive \nbehavioral  treatment  and  interventions  to  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  and  other  treatment \nproviders  in  these  units.  For  some  psychologists,  consultation  is  a  significant  part  of their  work. \nClinical  Psychologists  are  part  of Mental  Health  Services  and  report  to  the  facility’s  Senior \nPsychologist. \nThe  Case  Manager  is  responsible  for  facilitating  monthly  case  conferences  of the  multi- \ndisciplinary  team,  conducting  the  majority  of the  risk/needs  assessment,  developing  an \nIndividual  Change  and  Accountability  Plan  (ICAP)  tailored  to  the  risk  and  needs  of each  youth, \ncoordinating  and  prioritizing  interventions,  documenting  progress  in  the  ICAP,  communicating \nwith  parents,  guardians,  parole  officers,  and  others,  and  providing  weekly  individual  and/or \ngroup  counseling. \nThe  Senior  Youth  Correctional  Counselor  is  responsible  for  the  living  unit  schedule  and \nsupervising  the  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  on  the  unit.  The  Senior  Youth  Correctional \nCounselor  is  accountable  for  the  cleanliness,  security,  and  order  of the  living  unit.  This  position \nis  off-post. \nYouth  Correctional  Counselors  provide  direct  supervision,  behavior  management,  skills  training \nand  maintain  a  normative  culture  on  the  unit.  As  part  of the  normative  culture  model,  YCCs \nPage  46\nfacilitate  group  meetings  daily.  YCC  staffing  will  be  sufficient  to  ensure  that  small  groups  or \nactivities  can  be  run  simultaneously  during  the  day  or  evening,  as  needed. \nRe-entry  Specialists,  as  described  below  under  “Re-entry  Planning,”  may  have  a  variable \nworkload  depending  upon  where  they  are  located.  Since  youth  closer  to  their  expected  release \ndate  will  require  more  services  than  those  recently  committed,  DJJ  will  conduct  a  workload \nstudy  for  these  positions  and  develop  caseload  standards  based  on  that  analysis.  Staffing  levels \nfor  re-entry  specialists  will  be  subsequently  adjusted  to  reflect  these  caseload  standards. \nStaff  Schedule  for  Core  Program  Units \n  \nThe  staff coverage  schedule  for  core  program  units  is  to  accomplish  the  following  objectives: \ne  The  Clinical  Psychologist  schedule  will  overlap  that  of the  two  shifts  of Youth \nCorrectional  Counselors.  This  will  allow  coaching  and  consultation  with  all  YCCs. \ne  The  Case  Managers  will  have  overlapping  shifts  so  that  Case  Manager  coverage  is \nprovided  during  day  and  evening  hours  as  necessary  to  cover  the  program  day. \ne  The  Senior  Youth  Correctional  Counselor’s  hours  will  be  such  that  he/she  is  able  to \nprovide  direct  supervision  of all  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  at  least  once  a  week. \ne  There  will  be  no  fewer  than  three  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  assigned  to  a  living  unit \non  the  second  and  third  shift,  seven  days  a  week. \nExample  of Daily  Schedule  for  Core  Program  Units \nPrior  to  conversion  of any  living  unit  to  the  reform  model,  a  daily  schedule  will  be  developed  for \nthe  unit  to  ensure  that  all  youth  receive  a  minimum  of  10  hours  of treatment  per  week.  Daily \nschedules  will  be  coordinated  with  facility’s  Program  Service  Day  schedule  as  described  above. \nWhat  follows  is  a  sample  schedule. \nUnder  normal  circumstances,  all  youth  in  the  core  rehabilitative/treatment  program  are  to  be  out \nof their  rooms  and  busy  in  scheduled  activities  for  most  of the  day.  Scheduled  activities  include \nmeals,  small  and  large  groups,  school,  vocational  education,  work,  recreation,  one-on-one \ncounseling,  case  conferences,  visiting,  participating  in  asset-based  programs  (music,  literacy, \nculture,  art,  leadership,  etc.),  and  all  other  scheduled  activities. \nDJJ  will  have  a  core  treatment  program  which  provides  interventions  based  on  risk  and  needs. \nServices  will  be  more  intensive  for  youth  with  a  higher  risk  of reoffense.  Daily  schedules  will  be \ndeveloped  to  ensure  that  each  youth  gets  appropriate  treatment  services  in  a  manner  that \nminimizes  interruption  of educational  programming.  Each  youth  in  the  core  program  has  weekly \none-on-one  contact  with  the  YCC  assigned  to  work  with  him  or  her  to  review  behavioral \nprogress  and set  goals.  Lower  risk  youth  will  see  his  or  her  case  manager  one-on-one  twice  a \nmonth,  and  higher  risk  youth  four  times  per  month,  to  review  progress  on  ICAP  objectives  and \nset  new  objectives  as  appropriate.  Individual  counseling  and  family  treatment  may  be  provided \nby  the  psychologist  or  contract  treatment  provider  on  an  as-needed  basis.  Each  youth  is  to  have  a \nTreatment  Team  case  conference  each  month. \nA  large-group  meeting  will  take  place  in  the  morning  and  in  the  evening  to  respectively  plan  and \nreview the  day.  The  evening  meeting  will  include  review  of positive  behavior  for  the  day  and \nassignment  of  extra  privileges  for  the  evening. \nPage  47\nThe  schedule  will  include  a  variety  of facilitated  group  meetings  including  treatment  group, \njournal  group,  and  volunteer  group.  Treatment  groups  will  be  led  by  Case  Managers, \npsychologists,  youth  correctional  counselors,  and/or  contract  treatment  providers.  These  groups \nwill  focus  on  the  offense  cycle  and  development  of behavior  chain  analyses.  Volunteer  groups \nwill  be  led  by  volunteers  from  the  community.  These  may  include  AA  and  NA  groups,  although \nno  youth  will  be  required  to  attend  a  faith-based  program  that  he/she  finds  objectionable. \nVolunteer  groups  will  be  scheduled  by  the  Volunteer  Coordinator. \nA  large  group  meeting  takes  place  each  week  to  review  unit  goals  from  the  past  week, \nbrainstorm  strategies  for  improvements,  and  decide  how  to  celebrate  successes.  In  addition,  a \nlarge  group  celebration  of unit  progress  takes  place  each  week,  as  appropriate. \nVisiting  and religious  programs  may  take  place  throughout  the  week. \nAsset-based  programs  such  as  music,  literacy,  culture,  art,  leadership,  and  recreation  will  be \nprovided  on  weekends  and  evenings  during  the  week  as  time  permits.  DJJ  will  use  local \ncommunity  based  organizations,  faith-based  groups,  and  volunteers  to  assist  with  these \nprograms.  Some  of the  evening  time  with  volunteers  and  weekend  time  will  be  devoted  to \ndevelopment,  practice,  demonstration,  and  celebration  of these  asset-based  skills  and  knowledge. \nCore  Treatment  Program \n  \nIn  the  long  run,  different  living  units  may  have  a  specific  treatment  focus  -  such  as  substance \ndependence,  violence  reduction,  or  sexual  behavior  treatment.  These  units  will  offer programs, \nsuch  as  Aggression  Replacement  Training,  which  will  be  developed  during  the  first  years  of the \nplan  with  the  assistance  of outside  consultants. \nUntil  other programs  are  developed  and  implemented,  the  core  treatment  program  will  be  based \non  the  existing  interactive journaling  program  (including  additional  workbooks  being  developed \nby  The  Change  Company)  and  the  DJJ  Integrated  Treatment  Model.  The  number  of program \ncomponents  will  increase  in  the  second  and  third  years  of plan  implementation  to  include  the \ntreatment  programs  identified  in  this  Plan. \nSchool  for  Youth  in  the  Core  Program \nThe  education  program  is  addressed  in  the  Education  Remedial  Plan.  For  youth  in  the  core \nprogram  this  will  occur  in  academic  and  vocational  classrooms  located  outside  the  living  unit. \nSchool  is  provided  throughout  the  year. \nIn  response  to  the  California  Welfare  and  Institutions  Code,  the  Education  Remedial  Plan  calls \nfor  a  curriculum  “infused  with  values-based  character  education.”  The  Education  Remedial  Plan \nfurther  states  that  each  high  school  “shall  use  a  structured  positive  behavior  management  system \n99 \nAs  noted  in  Section  4,  **A  Rehabilitative  Treatment  Model,”  the  Integrated  Treatment  Model \nis  designed  to  be  implemented  across  all  parts  of DJJ  and  its  facilities,  including  the \nclassrooms  where  DJJ  youth  receive  education  services. \nPage  48\nHigh  School  Graduates  in  the  Core  Program \n  \nAbout  30  percent  of the  youth  in  DJJ  facilities  over  the  age  of  18  are  high  school  graduates. \nThe  training  focus  for  these  youth  will  either  be  post-secondary  education  through  the  use  of \nremote  learning  and  other  strategies,  or  acquisition  and  practice  of  skills  that  will  help  them \nget  a job  when  paroled  to  the  community.  This  includes job  readiness  skills  as  well  as \nlearning  specific  skills  associated  with  a  trade  or  other  line  of employment.  Vocational \neducation  offerings  will,  whenever possible,  be  coordinated  with  the  needs  of free  venture \nprogram  employers  and jobs  that  can  be  performed  by  youth  while  in  the  facilities. \nA  transition  course  will  be  developed  and  will  be  available  to  youth prior  to  parole \n(including  high  school  graduates)  and  will  include job  readiness  curriculum  and  a job  search \nprogram.  This  course  and job  search  program  will  be  in  place  by  September  2006. \nA  Work  Assignment  Coordinator  at  each  facility  will  help  youth  who  are  not  in  school  or \nother  time-consuming  activities  find  a job  with  four  to  six  hours  of on-campus  work  each \nweekday. \nOlder  Core  Program  Youth  Who  Haven’t  Graduated  from  High  School \nAbout  70  percent  of the  youth  in  DJJ  facilities  who  arel8  years  and  older  have  not  graduated \nfrom  high  school  or  completed  the  requirements  for  a  GED.  By  statute,  each  of these  youth \nare  required  to  have  a  high  school  graduation  plan  which  may  include  a  diploma,  GED,  high \nschool  proficiency  exam,  or  certificate  of completion.  This  plan  will  include  the  same \nopportunities  for  work  and  work  training  described  above  for  high  school  graduates. \nBehavior  Treatment  Program \nThe  Behavior  Treatment  Program  (BTP)  is  an  intensive  behavior  treatment  intervention  for \nyouth  exhibiting  violently  disruptive  behavior  who  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for  intensive  mental \nhealth  treatment  or  a  higher  level  of mental  health  care.  The  Behavior  Treatment  Program  is  not \npunishment,  although  it  may  contain  fewer  privileges  and  more  restricted  movement  than  the \ncore  treatment  program  living  units  as  necessary  for  security  reasons.  Instead,  it  is  a  more \nintensive  cognitive-behavioral  intervention  for  youths  who  are  not  able,  or  do  not  choose,  to \nmanage  their  aggressive  behavior  in  a  less  restrictive  environment. \nReferral  to  a  BTP  will  be  made  by  the  treatment  team,  which  will  include  a  mental  health \nprofessional.  If significant  mental  health  problems  are  detected,  the  youth  will  be  evaluated  for \nmental  health  treatment  need.  A  youth  who  meets  the  criteria  for  mental  health  treatment  at  a \nhigher  level  of care  than  outpatient  treatment  will  be  referred  to  the  appropriate  mental  health \nprogram  instead  of a  BTP,  or  transferred  to  the  appropriate  mental  health  treatment  program  if \nthe  treatment  need  is  detected  after  the  youth  has  been  admitted  to  a  BPT. \nYouth  in  Behavior  Treatment  Program  units  will  receive  treatment/rehabilitation  services, \nincluding  appropriate  educational  and  vocational  programming,  in  the  least  restrictive  manner \npossible.  If,  for  any  youth,  safe  delivery  of the  services  cannot  be  accomplished  through  normal \nprocedures,  an  alternative  schedule  or procedure  will  be  developed.  At  45  days,  a  staffing  will \nevaluate  the  need  for  continued  stay  in  the  BTP  orreturn  to  core  treatment  unit.  For  youth \nexpected  to  continue  in  the  BTP,  staff will  modify  the  individual  treatment  plan  to  account  for  a \nlengthier  stay  and  to  ensure  a  comprehensive  program  is  provided,  including  all  board  ordered \nprograms  as  necessary. \nPage  49\nDJJ  will  not  tolerate  any  conditions  of confinement  or practices  in  the  treatment  of youth  that  are \ndegrading  or  humiliating.  Limiting  clothing  to  underwear  will  not  be  tolerated  in  BTPs  or \nanywhere  else  in  DJJ  facilities.  Practices  not justified  as  necessary  for  security  when  there  are \neffective  alternatives  that  are  more  respectful  of the  youth  will  be  discontinued. \nStaffing  Standards  for  BTP  Units \nThe  Behavioral  Treatment  Program  will  have  a  maximum  of 24  youth  per  living  unit.  These \nunits  will  have  the  following  coverage: \n1  Clinical  Psychologist \n1  Treatment  Team  Supervisor  or  equivalent \n1  Casework  Specialist  or  equivalent \n1  Senior  Youth  Correctional  Counselor \n3  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  on  the  second  watch \n4  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  on  the  third  watch \n4  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  to  assist  in  the  classroom  during  the  school  day \n4  Teachers  during  the  school  day \n1  Youth  Correctional  Officer  on  the  first  watch \nThrough  the  master  planning  process  and  replacement  of antiquated  facilities  as  discussed  in \nSection  8,  future  BTP  living  units  will  be  limited  to  eight  to  16  youth  as  guided  by  contemporary \nstandards  of care  and  national  standards  for  special  populations. \nBTP  Treatment  Team  Organization \nB TP  living  units  w ill  operate  under  the  unit  team  concept  with  the  Treatment  Team  Supervisor \noperating  as  the  leader  of the  unit  team. \nThe  roles  and  responsibilities  of BTP  treatment  team  members  are  the  same  as  described  for  core \ntreatment  program  teams.  In  the  BTPs,  the  Casework  Specialist  or  equivalent  performs  the  same \nfunctions  as  Case  Managers  in  the  core  program. \nStaff  Schedule  for  BTP  Units \nThe  staff coverage  schedule  for  BTP  units  is  to  accomplish  the  following  objectives: \ne  The  Clinical  Psychologist  and  Casework  Specialist  schedules  will  overlap  that  of the  two \nshifts  of Youth  Correctional  Counselors.  This  will  allow  coaching,  consultation,  and \ntreatment  team  coordination  with  YCCs. \ne  The  Senior  Youth  Correctional  Counselor’s  hours  will  be  such  that  he/she  is  able  to \nprovide  direct  supervision  of all  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  at least  once  a  week. \ne  There  will  be  no  fewer  than  three  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  on  the  second  shift \nseven  days  a  week. \ne  There  will  be  no  fewer  than  four  Youth  Correctional  Counselors  on  the  third  shift  seven \ndays  a  week. \ne  Every  occupied  classroom  will  have  a  teacher  and  a  Youth  Correctional  Counselor.  No \nclass  will  have  more  than  six  students. \nPage  50\nA  Program  Day  Schedule  will  be  developed  for  each  BTP  to  maximize  out  of room  time  and  to \nensure  structured  activity  based  on  evidence-based  principles  for  40  to  70  percent  of waking \nhours. \nBTP  Referral  Criteria \n  \nWhile  subject  to  refinement,  in  consultation  with  national  experts,  DJJ’s  initial  criteria  for \nreferral  to  a  BTP  are  that  a  youth  having  one  or  more  of the  following  behaviors  within  the  last \n90  days  would be  eligible  for  referral  to  a  Behavior  Treatment  Program.  Youth  who  meet  the \ncriteria  do  not  have  to  be  referred;  youth  who  are  referred  are  not  automatically  placed  in  a  BTP. \nBattery  on  a  staff member \nBattery  on  a  youth  with  a  weapon \nSerious  battery  on  a youth  without  a  weapon \nAggressor  in  a  group  physical  attack \nAggressor  in  a  group  disturbance \nPossession  or  manufacture  of a  weapon \nReturn  from  a  CDCR  adult  facility  where  the  youth  was  last  assigned  to  a  Security \nHousing  Unit  (SHU)  because  of aggressive  or  violent  behavior \ne  Based  on  significant  evidence,  youth  is  identified  as  currently  involved  in  the  direction, \npromotion,  or  encouragement  of violence. \nA  youth  will  not  be  admitted  to  a  BTP  if he  or  she  is  in  imminent  danger  to  self,  gravely \ndisabled,  or requires  clinical  restraints  to  maintain  safety.  In  these  cases,  the  youth  will  be \nreferred  for  appropriate  mental  health/healthcare  services. \nBTP  Acceptance  Process \nReferrals  for  placement  in  a  Behavior  Treatment  Program  must  be  made  by  the  treatment  team \n(which  includes  a  mental  health  professional).  If  significant  mental  health  problems  are  detected, \nthe  youth  will  be  referred  to  a  more  intensive  treatment  setting  such  as  Intensive  Behavior \nTreatment  Program  (IBTP).  (The  IBTP  is  described  in  the  Mental  Health  Remedial  Plan.)  A \ncentralized  multi-disciplinary  team,  chaired  by  the  Classification  Administrator,  reviews  referrals \nand  makes  a  determination  if the  referral  is  consistent  with  entrance  criteria  and  if the  placement \nis  appropriate. \nBTP  Exit  Criteria  and  Process \nThe  length  of stay  in  BTPs  will  vary  widely.  Many  youth  will  respond  with  diminished \naggressive  behavior  sufficient  to  warrant  return  to  the  core  treatment  program  within  days  or \nweeks.  Stays  longer  than  180  days  will  be  rare.  The  length  of stay  will  vary  depending  on \nreferral  behavior,  current  treatment/rehabilitation  concerns,  behavior  within  the  BTP,  and  the \nhistory  of previous  transfers  from  this  level  of care. \nUpon  admittance  to  a  BTP,  the  treatment  team  will  establish  specific  goals  and  behavioral \nexpectations  to  be  met  prior  to  release.  These  goals  will  primarily  focus  on  the  reasons  behind \nthe  behavior(s)  that  resulted  in  referral  to  the  BTP.  A  youth  will  be  transferred  to  a  less  intensive \nlevel  of care  upon  determination  of the  treatment  team  that  the  youth  has  met  these  goals  and  has \ndemonstrated  significantly  diminished  aggressive  behavior  of  sufficient  duration. \nPage  51\nDetection  of a  significant  mental  health  problem  directly  related  to  aggressive  behavior  that \nrequires  more  intensive  mental  health  services  than  can  be  provided  within  the  BTP  unit  will  also \nbe  grounds  for  transfer  out  of a  BTP. \nIf  a  youth  has  been  in  a  BTP  for  four  months  or  longer,  treatment  team  reviews  of his  or  her \nprogress  will  include  at  least  one  clinician  who  is  not  regularly  involved  in  the  youth’s  treatment. \nWhen  the  youth  has  met  treatment  goals  and  behavior  expectations,  a  plan  for  transition  back  to \nan  appropriate  living  unit  will  be  developed.  Transition  activities  may  include: \nRegular  visits  to  the  designated  home  living  unit \nSchool  attendance  in  the  core  treatment  program  school  area \nAttendance  in  small  group  with  the  home  living  unit \nIdentification  of any  unresolved  gang  or  transfer  issues  that  may  affect  transition \nWritten  agreement  not  to  promote,  direct,  or  participate  in  further  violent  or  disruptive \nbehavior \nBTP  Treatment  Programs \n  \nThe  Behavior  Treatment  Program  is  a  behavior  modification  program  based  primarily  on  skills \ntraining  and  positive  reinforcement  for  improvements  in  behavior.  Program  components \nemphasize  cognitive  and  behavioral  skill  acquisition  in  anger  control,  emotional  regulation, \nconflict  resolution,  effective  communication,  and  behavior  analysis  related  to  the  maladaptive \nbehavior  that  led  to  the  youth’s  referral  to  the  program.  These  are  all  elements  of DJJ’s \nIntegrated  Treatment  Model.  BTPs  also  provide  a  safe,  secure  environment  within  which  youth \nreceived  full  educational  and  other  constructive  programmatic  activities. \nSchool  for  Youth  in  BTP  Units \n  \nEducation  is  provided  for youth  in  the  BTP  who  do  not  have  a  high  school  diploma  or  GED. \nUsing  the  same  criteria  as  applied  in  core  programs,  education  directed  at  gaining  a  GED  rather \nthan  a  High  School  diploma  will  be  provided  when  appropriate. \nEducation  for  youth  in  the  Behavior  Treatment  Program  will  take  place  on  the  unit  in  small \nclassrooms  with  no  more  than  six  students.  Each  occupied  classroom  will  have  one  teacher  and \none  Youth  Correctional  Counselor  assigned  to  it. \nHigh  School  Graduates  in  BTPs  and  those  with  GEDs \nAbout  30  percent  of the  youth  in  DJJ  facilities  over  the  age  of  18  are  high  school  graduates  or \nhave  their  GED.  The  kind  of behavior  that  leads  to  a  referral  to  a  BTP  is  generally  high  on  the \ntreatment/rehabilitation  hierarchy.  Consequently,  the  treatment  program  for  high  school \ngraduates  will  address  behavior  that  caused  them  to  be  admitted  to  the  BTP  and  the  skills  they \nneed  to  understand  and  control  their behavior.  Additionally,  the  treatment/rehabilitation  program \nwill  include  meaningful  post-secondary  education  through  the  use  of remote  learning  and  other \nstrategies,  or  acquisition  and  practice  of job-related  skills  as  appropriate. \nHigh  school  graduates  may  be  assigned  to  a  part-time job  within  the  BTP  living  unit. \nPage  52\nOlder  Youth  in  BTPs  Who  Have  Not  Graduated  from  High  School \nAbout  70  percent  of the  youth  in  DJJ  facilities  who  are  18  years  and  older  have  not \ngraduated  from  high  school  or  completed  for  the  requirements  for  a  GED.  By  statute,  each  of \nthese  youth  is  required  to  have  a  high  school  graduation  plan which  may  include  a  diploma, \nGED,  high  school  proficiency  exam,  or  certificate  of completion.  This  plan  will  include  the \nsame  opportunities  for  work  and  work  training  described  above  for  high  school  graduates  in \nthe  BTP  as  appropriate. \nImplementation  of BTPs \nImplementation  of BTP  units  will  be  phased  in  and  will  require  facility  modifications  and/or  the \naddition  of modular  buildings  to  ensure  adequate  space  for  treatment,  education,  and  recreation. \nSubstance  Abuse  Treatment  Program \nDJJ  research  staff estimate  that  up  to  80  percent  of youth  in  the  division’s  facilities  have  some \nlevel  of  substance  abuse  treatment  needs.  Consequently,  evidence-based  substance  abuse \ntreatment  will  occur  throughout  the  core  rehabilitation/treatment  program.  Youth  with  significant \ncomorbid  mental  health  issues  will  receive  substance  abuse/dependence  treatment  as  described  in \nthe  Mental  Health  Remedial  Plan. \nAssessment  for  Substance  Abuse \n  \nThe  need  for  substance  abuse  treatment  will  be  determined  using  a  valid  substance  use \nscreening/assessment  tool. \nProgram  Content \nBecause  of their  developmental  stage,  interventions  for juveniles  require  somewhat  different \ncontent  and  emphasis  than  those  for  adults.  Motivation  and  engagement  strategies  are \nparticularly  important  with  a  youthful  population.  DJJ  will  train  Youth  Correctional  Counselors \nand  others  in  Motivational  Interviewing  to  promote  motivation  and  engagement  in  substance \nabuse  (and  other)  treatment/rehabilitation  programs. \nBehavioral  analysis  —  a  basic  component  for  all  DJJ  cognitive-behavioral  interventions  —  will  be \nused  to  identify  the  function  of drug  using  behavior  for  each  youth  in  treatment.  As  with  other \nmaladaptive  behaviors,  an  understanding  of the  function  of drug  using  behavior  is  the \nmechanism  by  which  specific  interventions  are  identified  that  will  teach  the  youth  skills \nappropriate  to  his  or  her  specific  needs. \nSkills  generalization  interventions  are  also  an  important  component  of cognitive-behavioral \ntreatment.  The  key  elements  for  skills  development  and  generalization  in  substance  abuse  are: \nunderstanding  the  function  of drug  use  through  behavioral  analysis,  developing  skills  for \nabstaining  or  reducing  the  likelihood  of relapse,  and  developing  relapse  prevention  plans. \nTraining  of all  residential/line  staff in  cognitive-behavioral  treatment  —  particularly  in  the  area  of \nskills  acquisition  —  is  an  important  part  of effective  substance  abuse  treatment.  Use  of this  model \nwill  enable  DJJ  to  deliver  most  of its  substance  abuse  treatment  in  core  program. \nSubstance abuse/dependence  treatment  will  be  evidence-based  and  all  staff providing  such \ntreatment  will  have  competency-based  training  as  required  by  the  relevant  evidence-based \ntreatment  program.  Notwithstanding  the  requirement  for  evidence-based  treatment,  traditional \nPage  53\n12-step  programs  may  be  used  as  a  support  for  skills  generalization  and  relapse  prevention, \nexcept  that  no  youth  will  be  required  to  attend  faith-based  programs  involuntarily. \nSex  Behavior  Treatment \nThe  Sexual  Behavior  Treatment  Program  is  described in  the  Sexual  Behavior  Treatment  Program \nRemedial  Plan  that  has  already  been  accepted  by  the  court.  DJJ  will  reconcile  the  Sex  Behavior \nTreatment  Program  with  the  Safety  and  Welfare  Plan  as  necessary. \nMental  Health  Treatment \nPolicy,  staffing,  and  programs  for  mentally  ill  youth  are  addressed  in  the  Mental  Health \nRemedial  Plan.  DJJ  will  reconcile  the  Mental  Health  Remedial  Plan  with  the  Safety  and  Welfare \nPlan  as  necessary. \nIncentives \nPositive  incentives  and  negative  sanctions  are  an  integral  part  of the integrated  treatment  model \ndiscussed  in  Section  4.  A  continuum  of rewards  and  consequences  is  needed  to  teach  and \nreinforce  the  insight  and  skill  needed  for  youths  to  make  lasting  changes  in  behavior.  An \nincentive  system—  in  which  privileges  are  “purchased”  through  accumulation  of points  awarded \nfor  positive  behavior  and  effort —  will  be  incorporated  into  the  treatment  model. \nPositive  Reinforcements \n  \nYouth  will  receive  positive  reinforcements  when  they  attain  long  and  short-term  objectives. \nYouth  need  additional  reinforcement  through  strong  social  approval  and  support  of the \naccomplishment.  In  general,  positive  rewards  should  outnumber  negative  sanctions  by a  ratio  of \nfour  to  one. \nAchievement  of primary  objectives,  such  as  high  school  graduation  or  a  GED,  will  be  recognized \nwithin  the  Ward  Incentive  System  through  activities  such  as  entertainment,  special  events,  or \nceremonies  with  extensive  family  and  community  involvement.  Positive  Program  reinforcements \nwill  also  be  applied  as  a  youth  demonstrates  progress  with  his/her  treatment  plan. \nThis  may  include  large  and  small  gains.  Accomplishments  that  might  be  taken  for  granted  by \nsome  youth,  such  as  going  to  school  every  day  for  a  week,  may  be  important  to  reinforce  for \nother  youth.  By  reinforcing  this  particular  step,  the  likelihood  of the  youth  taking  the  next  step  - \ngoing  to  school  for  two  weeks  straight -  is  enhanced.  Reinforcements  for  such  accomplishments \nwill  be  individualized  and  can  include  such  things  as  special  dorm  activities,  dorm  awards,  or \nother  reinforcements  consistent  with  the  treatment  program. \nSpecial  rewards  may  be  arranged  and  coordinated  by  the  Volunteer/Positive  Incentives \nCoordinator  at  each  facility. \nAlthough  the  variety  of rewards  is  limited  only  by  staff creativity,  care  should  be  taken  to  select \na  reward  that  is  meaningful  to  the  youth  while  retaining  a  sense  of proportion  both  in  relation  to \nthe  accomplishment  and  in  relation  to  the  rewards  received  by  other  youth  for  similar \naccomplishments. \nPersons  other  than  program  staff must  also  reinforce  accomplishments  through  praise  and  other \nappropriate  reinforcement.  Line  staff will  work  with  parents,  mentors,  teachers,  and  others  in  the \nPage  54\nyouth's  support  network  to  assure  that  they  too  are  sensitive  to  gains  and  that  they  provide  their \nown  forms  of recognition. \nSanctions \nAs  with  the  reward  system,  potential  sanctions  will  be  clearly  identified  in  advance  and  applied \nin  a  consistent  and  timely  fashion.  Sanctions  will  be  tied  to  the  severity  of the  behavior. \nTransition  Services \nDJJ  will  make  improvements  to  transition  services  by  establishing  a  transition  program  and \nincreasing  contact  with  parole  agents,  community  providers,  and  families  as  youth  near  parole. \nNew  or  redirected  positions  will  be  created  for  these  purposes  at  central  office,  in  the \ncommunity,  and  at  each  facility. \nStaffing  for  Transition  Services \nThe  following  new  or  redirected  positions  will  provide  services  related  to  transition  planning  and \nre-entry: \nA  dedicated  position  for  re-entry  and  transition  services \nRe-Entry  Coordinators  assigned  on  a  regional  basis \nRe-Entry  Specialists  at  each  facility \nVocational  Specialist  at  each  facility \nVictims  Services/Restitution  Specialist  at  each  facility \nAmong  other  things,  a  central  office  coordinator  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  protocols  for \nworking  with  community  providers  to  provide  transition  services. \nThe  Re-Entry  Coordinators  will  work  on  a  regional  basis.  These  staff will  work  with  the  re-entry \nspecialists  and  be  responsible  for  developing  working  relationships  and linkages  with \ncommunity-based  service  providers,  including  group  homes,  county  mental  health  departments, \nalcohol  and  drug  treatment  providers,  education  agencies,  etc.  They  will  assist  parole  agents  in \ncoordinating  with  local  service  providers  for parolees  who  are  receiving  services.  They  will \ncommunicate  with  facility  staff prior  to  parole  to  identify  placement  issues  and  assess  needs  for \ncommunity-based  services  and  develop  systems  for  referring  youths,  families  and  parole  agents \nto  resources  in  the  community. \nRe-Entry  Plannin \nEach  youth  within  the  facility  will  be  assigned  a  Re-Entry  Specialist.  The  Re-Entry  Specialists \nwill  participate  in  case  conferences  and  be  responsible  for  casework  guidance  for  re-entry \nplanning,  including  help  with  development  of individualized  parole  plans.  Re-Entry  Specialists \nwill  provide  liaison  to  the  parole  offices,  families,  other  agencies,  systems  and  organizations  to \nimprove  transition  of youth  back  to  the  community.  These  positions  will  be  phased  in  as  the  new \nunits  are  brought  on  line. \nWhere  needed,  DJJ  will  add  vocational  specialists  at  all  facilities  with  vocational  programs. \n(Some  facilities  already  have  vocational  specialists.)  Among  other  things,  these  staff will  be \nresponsible  for  vocational  and  career  counseling  and  coordination  with  parole  and  Re-Entry \nSpecialists  in  transition  planning  for  future  employment  in  the  community. \nPage  55\nAs  described  in  Section  1,  consistent  with  its  key  principles  relating  to  victims,  DJJ  will  hire \nVictims  Services/Restitution  Specialists  at  each  facility  to  ensure  that  victim  impact  information \nis  included  in  youth  programming  in  a  manner  consistent  with  Restorative  Justice  principles. \nIncorporation  of victim  impact  and  substantial  injury  information  into  the  ICAP  is  necessary  in \norder  to  hold  youth  accountable  and  to  develop  detailed  intervention  strategies  that  provide \nopportunities  for  youth  to  increase  their  understanding  of the  harm  they  have  caused  to  their \nvictim(s),  survivor(s)  and  their  community. \nPreparation  for  Parole \nUltimately,  all  of the  programs  and  services  a  youth  receives  in  DJJ  facilities  will  be  geared \ntoward  preparing  the  youth  for  successful  transition  to  the  community.  In  preparing  a  youth  for \nparole,  programs  are  designed  to: \n1.  Re-establish  and/or  strengthen  the  youth’s  bonds  to  conventional  values,  persons, \nactivities,  and  institutions, \n2.  Provide  the  youth  with  the  skills  and  opportunities  to  be  successful  in  traditional  settings, \n3.  Teach  the  youth  the  social  and  interpersonal  skills  necessary  to  maintain  positive \ninvolvement  with  family,  school,  work,  pro-social  peers,  and  community  institutions, \n  Develop  the  youth’s  competence  in  life  skills,  education,  and  employment, \nA Address  individualized  risk  factors  related  to  risk  of reoffense, \n6.  Consistently  apply  graduated  rewards  and  sanctions  that  recognize  achievement  and \nprovide  immediate  accountability  for  violations. \nCase  Planning  for  Transition  to  Parole \nRe-entry  planning  will  begin  with  a  Community  Assessment  Report  at  intake.  This  report  will \ninclude  contacts  and  interviews  with  parents  and/or  close  relatives  and  other  people  in  the \ncommunity  who  can  provide  significant  information  about  the  youth.  The  Individual  Change  and \nAccountability  Plan  will  be  modified  to  include  specific  re-entry  goals  developed  and  signed  by \nthe  youth  and  his  or  her  Parole  Agent. \nRisk  and  need  factors  most  closely  tied  to  the  possibility  of re-offending  will  be  addressed  in  the \nICAP.  Consequently,  the  re-entry  portion  of the  case  plan  will  identify  intervention  priorities, \nand  relapse  prevention  strategies. \nWhere  available  and  appropriate,  the  case  plan  will  include: \n1.  Involvement  with  mentors  or  other  persons  serving  as  role  models, \n2.  Involvement  with  community  organizations  that  provide  recreational,  cultural,  or \nancillary  educational  experiences, \nParticipation  in  family  or  group  counseling,  both  therapeutic  and  educational, \nyw \n4.  Continuation  in  programs  designed  to  address  needs  such  as  substance  abuse,  mental \nhealth  or  sex  offender  treatment  issues,  and \n5.  Intensive  involvement  with  parents  or  guardians  to  strengthen  parenting  and  discipline \nskills. \nThe  case  plan  is  to  provide  for  direct  external  control  over  the  youth  until  the  locus  of control  can \nbe  shifted  to  traditional  socialization  units,  such  as  the  family,  school,  place  of employment,  and \nultimately,  to  the  youth. \nPage  56\nWhat  happens  after  release  from  confinement  is  central  to  the  success  of juvenile justice  reform. \nMaster planning  for  such  a  comprehensive  system  is  discussed  in  Section  8,  “Other  Issues.” \nTransition  Plans  for  Youth  in  Special Treatment  Programs \n  \nTransition  planning  for  youth  in  the  Sexual  Behavior  Treatment  Program  and  Mental  Health \nPrograms  is  addressed  in  their  respective  remedial  plans.  DJJ  will  reconcile  these  plans  with  the \nSafety  and  Welfare  Plan  as  necessary. \nACTION  PLAN \n1.  DJJ  will  phase  in  the  rehabilitative  model  one  facility  at  a  time.  It  will  convert  N.A. \nChaderyjian  to  a  special  treatment  facility  by  April  1,  2007.  It  will  convert  at  least  one  facility \nto  the  rehabilitative  model  as  described  in  this  Plan  by  July  1,  2007.  It  will  complete \nconversion  of all  facilities  to  the  rehabilitative  model  by  July  1,  2010. \n2.  DJJ  will  establish  statewide  minimum  standards  for  the  Program  Service  Day  by  October  1, \n2006  and  establish  a  Program  Service  Day  schedule  for  N.A.  Chadjerian by  November  1, \n2006.  DJJ  will  establish  the  Program  Service  Day  schedule  for  the  first  facility  converted  to \nthe  rehabilitative  model  by  December  1,  2006.  The  Program  Service  Day  schedule  will  be \nimplemented  at  each  facility  as  it  is  converted  to  the  rehabilitative  model. \n3.  DJJ  will  designate  an  administrator  of programs  at  each  facility  prior  to  starting  conversion \nof the  facility  to  the  rehabilitative  model. \n4.  DJJ  will  hire  necessary  program  managers,  volunteer/positive  incentives  coordinators,  and \nconflict  resolution  team  members  prior  to  conversion  of a  facility  to  the  rehabilitative  model. \n5.  DJJ  will  have  sufficient  BTP  units  to  meet  the  needs  of its  population  and  will  eliminate  all \nSpecial  Management  Program  units  by  July  1,  2008.  BTP  units  will  be  phased  in  on  the \nschedule  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan. \n6.  DJJ  will  develop  a  Program  Service  Day  Schedule  for  each  BTP  unit  to  maximize  out  of \nroom  time  and  to  ensure  structured  activity  based  on  evidence-based  principles  for  40  to  70 \npercent  of waking  hours  at  a  date  to  be  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this \nRemedial  Plan. \n7.  DJJ  will  complete  training  on  its  Integrated  Treatment  Model,  including  the  Risk  Needs \nAssessment,  Motivational  Interviewing,  Normative  Culture,  and  other key  treatment \ncomponents  by  a  date  to  be  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial \nPlan. \nPage  57\nSXRD  SPIE  WAT  OF \nCWE  RA  ERE  PORE  RA  EO  RED  WOR  AY  WHE \nDJJ  hak \"solicited  interest  by  local  providers  to  provide  services  for  females  at  facilities  other  than \nVentura. \nRegardless  of where  females  committed  to  DJJ  are  housed  in  the  future,  parity  requires  that \nfemales  receive  services  under  a  rehabilitative  model  that  are  gender  specific  and  equal  to  those \nprovided  to  males. \nFemales  presently  occupy  only  five  of  12  single-room  living  units  at  the  Ventura  facility.  If \nfemales  are  removed  from  Ventura,  the  facility  can  become  an  all  male  facility.  If DJJ is  unable \nto  contract  for  services  for  females,  it  may  be  necessary  to  open  a  portion  of the  Ventura  facility \nfor  males. \nBased  on  information  received  in  response  to  a  formal  request  for  Letters  of Interest,  and \ncontingent  upon  necessary  legislative  approval  and  funding,  DJJ  will  consult  with  experts  for \nadolescent  and  young  adult  female  offenders  to  develop  and  issue  a  Request  for  Proposals  to \nprovide  services  for  females  in  secure  placements  outside  of DJJ’s  facilities. \nAs  recognized  by  DJJ,  successfully  contracting  for  services  for  females  is  by  no  means  certain. \nIn  the  event  DJJ  is  not  successful,  a  contingency  plan  for  implementing  reform  for  females  is \nneeded.  Alternatives  may  include  continued  use  of all  or part  of the  Ventura  facility  for  females, \nconversion  of all  or  part  of other  DJJ  facilities,  or  construction  of a  new  facility.  A  combination \nof contracting  for  services  for  some  females  and  the  state  providing  services  to  others  may  also \nbe  a  feasible  alternative. \nDJJ  will  consult  with  one  or  more  female  offender  experts  to  assist  with  gender  specific \nprograms  for  adolescent  and  young  adult  females. \nwr me en So peers ro HON vee eewea r so wr \n1.  DJJ  will  issue  a  request  for  Letters  of Interest  from  local  governmental  entities  and  qualified \nprivate  parties  to  provide  secure  residential  and  rehabilitative  services  to  females  committed \nto  DJJ  by  July  1,  2006. \n2.  DJJ  will  consult  with  one  or  more  national  experts  to  begin  development  of gender  specific \nprograms  for  females  and  adaptation  of the  Integrated  Treatment  Model  to  the  DJJ  female \npopulation  by  August  1,  2006. \n3.  The  administrator  for  female programs  described  in  Section  2  will  develop  an \nimplementation  plan  and  schedule  and  ensure  that  gender-specific  services  for  females  are \nprovided  at  contracted  facilities  and/or  one  or  more  DJJ  facilities  that  are  equal  to  those \nprovided  to  males  under  the  rehabilitative  model  described  in  this  Plan  by  a  date  to  be \nspecified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan. \nPage  58\n4.  DJJ  will  request  legislative  authority  and  funding  to  issue  a  Request  for  Proposals  by  July  1, \n2006  and  enter  into  contracts  for  services  for  females  upon  successful  negotiation  with \nresponsive  bidders. \n5.  Inthe  event  DJJ  is  unable  to  contract  for  services  for  some  or  all  females,  DJJ  will  convert \nall  or part  of an  existing  facility,  or  build  one  or  more  new  facility,  to  provide  rehabilitative \nservices  to  females  by  a  date  to  be  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this \nRemedial  Plan.  The  size  and  mission  of the  state  facility,  or  facilities,  will  be  affected  by  the \nnumber  and  type  of females  for  whom  services  are  provided  through  contracts. \nPage  59\n&cN  ERaS  ga N PRaEVe s ey NSYY   y \nTPTIA y eBB PereR ys   TM Ig ScS .

This  section  discusses  those  other  issues. \nw \nAA&  CsCegEeoeo ParNet aS os ReeC oEe s rIReeR eCef}es   OceCeT aeI taOcaNes   (&o PawHes tE PaIpyA°   \n3 \nThe  Consent  Decree  required  DJJ  to  “develop  formal  criteria  for  accepting  wards  into  the  CYA \npursuant  to  Welfare  and  Institutions  Code  Section  736”  by  November  2004.  It  further prohibits \nDJJ  from  accepting  “more  wards than  can  be  materially  benefited  by  the  CYA’s  reformatory  and \neducational  discipline”  and  it  prohibits  the  division  from  accepting  “wards  for  whom  the  CYA \ndoes  not  have  adequate  facilities.”  DJJ’s  interpretation  of these  Consent  Decree  requirements  is \ndisputed  by  the  plaintiff.  The  plaintiff reserves  her  right  to  challenge  DJJ’s  interpretation  through \nthe  dispute  resolution  procedures  under  the  Consent  Decree.  The  Acceptance/Rejection  Criteria \nsection  of this  Plan  is  based  on  defendant’s  interpretation  of the  Consent  Decree  which  governs \ndefendant’s  planning  unless  and  until  the  dispute  resolution  process  results  in  a  different \nconstruction. \nDJJ  is  working  with  state  and  local  partners  to  develop,  by  September  1,  2006,  a  formal \nacceptance/rejection  process to  address  particularly  those  youth  with  complex  medical \nconditions,  persistent  and  serious  mental  health  care  needs  and/or  developmental  disabilities  who \ncould  not  materially  benefit  from  a  commitment  to  DJJ  who  may  not  be  able  to  materially  benefit \nfrom  the  type  of rehabilitative/treatment  program  outlined  in  the  Safety  and  Welfare  or  other \nremedial  plans  and  who  could  better  be  served  in  alternate  programs. \nAs  confirmed  by  the  September  1,  2005  Status  Report  to  the  Legislature,  DJJ  believes  that  the \nstate’s  facilities  should  be  used  for  only  the  higher risk  and/or  higher  need  youth  in  the  statewide \njuvenile justice  continuum.  DJJ  will  clarify  its  policies  to  accept  only  youth  who  are  appropriate \nfor  the  state’s  facilities  (i.e.,  those  who  are  higher  risk/higher  need)  and  will  work  with  the \ncounties  to  develop  strategies  to  ensure  that  youth  who  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for  commitment \nto  DJJ,  but  have  exhausted  all  local  options,  are  appropriately  served. \nDJJ  will  work  with  state  and  local  entities,  including  DMH,  DDS,  probation,  and  private \ncommunity  based  organizations  to  identify  those  kinds  of youth  who  would  be  more \nappropriately  served  outside  a  state  correctional  setting. \nFor  those  youth  who  are  accepted,  DJJ  will  physically  admit  only  those  new  commitments  who \narrive  with  required  documentation  and  thorough  review  and  assessment  of their  significant \nmental  health  problems,  medical  conditions,  developmental  disabilities,  and/or  sexually  violent \noffenses. \nDJJ  will  begin  working  with  counties  on  statewide  definitions  related  to  “risks”  and  “needs”  and \nwill  explore  long-term  strategies  for  conducting  initial  classification  /assessment  while  the  youth \nis  in  county  custody.  This  is  intended  to  facilitate  counties  recommending  the  most  appropriate \ncommitments  to  DJJ.  Counties  conducting  initial  assessments  would  also  help  expedite  the  DJJ \nPage  60\nReception  Center  process  and  encourage  quicker placement  into  a  DJJ  facility  for  youth \ncommitted  to  the  state.  Intake/rejection  criteria  should  be  fluid  so  that  they  are reevaluated \nannually  to  take  into  account  progress  in  implementation  of the  rehabilitative  model  and  the \nmaster  plans.  This  way  the  criteria  can  change  as  the  programs  and  facilities  that  are \ncontemplated  come  on  line.  A  process  to  do  this  is  discussed  below  in  the  section  titled  “Master \nPlanning.” \nIn  addition  to  a  master  planning  effort,  DJJ  will  improve  communications  and  relations  with \ncounty juvenile justice  agencies  through  a  number  of initiatives  including  the  following: \ne  Dedicated  Community/Court Liaisons  staff to  work  in  counties  to  improve \ncommunication,  relationships  and  collaboration  with  the  community,  courts,  probation \nand  law  enforcement.  The  responsibilities  of Community/Court  Liaisons  will  include, \namong  other  things,  interpreting  and  clarifying  intake  policies  and  procedures  and \nassisting  counties  with  identifying  alternative  strategies  for  youth  rejected  by  DJJ. \ne  The  Community/Court  Liaisons  will  track  cases  that  are  rejected,  identify  trends  in \ncommitments,  and  monitor  requests  for  court  documents  and  corrections  to  commitment \norders.  They  will  also  help  expedite  the  flow  of information  between  committing  counties \nand  DJJ  and  facilitate  the  physical  acceptance  of new  commitments. \nDJJ  will  work  with  counties  to  analyze  the  effectiveness  of the  current  “sliding  scale”  fee \nschedule  and  make  recommendations  for  alternative  strategies  that  would  better  serve  the  state’s \npublic  safety  needs. \npolicy  requires  that  an  orientation  be  provided  within  10  days  of arrival  at  a  DJJ \nfacility,  the  current  process  varies  significantly  by  facility.  The  information  provided  is  not \nstandardized  nor  does  it  include  any  information  about  restitution  obligations  or  victim  impact. \nFurthermore,  little  information  is  provided  to  youth  on  what  to  expect  at  DJJ  prior  to  their \narrival.  This  lack  of information  may  contribute  to  the  belief held  by  many  youth  coming  to  DJJ \nthat  they  must  fight  or join  a  gang  to  avoid  becoming  the  victim  of physical  or  sexual  assault. \nWhen  a  youth  is  accepted  at  the  Reception  Center,  written  notification  is  sent  to  the  family \nand/or  next  of kin  notifying  them  of the  youth’s  arrival  along  with  detailed  information  about \nvisiting,  mail  procedures  and  contact  information.  Additionally,  the  Parole  Office  where  the \nyouth  will  eventually  be  paroling  sends  a  letter  to  the  family  and/or  next  of kin  to  notify  them  of \nthe  Community  Parole  Orientation  Program.  This  program  includes  a  monthly  meeting  where \nparole  staff provide  information  regarding  the  Department  and  answer  questions  from  family \nmembers  and  other  interested  parties. \nEvery  facility  also  has  a  Family  Council  which  provides  a  forum  for  parents  to  meet  on  a \nmonthly  basis  with  the  Superintendent  and  management  staff.  Unfortunately,  both  the \nCommunity  Parole  Orientation  Program  and  the  Family  Council  meetings  are  often  poorly \nattended. \nPage  61\nFamily  Ievelvement \nTreatment/rehabilitation  outcomes  for  youth  are  enhanced  by  successful  involvement  of parents, \nguardians,  and/or  other  significant  adults in  the  youth’s  life.  Family  involvement is  therefore  a \nKey  principle  of this  Plan. \nThere  are  various  points  in  the  course  of confinement  which  provide  opportunities  to  involve \nfamilies.  These  include  at  the  county  level  prior  to  placement  in  DJJ,  during  the  reception \nprocess,  during  confinement  at  a  DJJ  facility,  and  during  and  after  transition  to  the  community. \nFamily  members  may  serve  as  an  important  resource  at  any  or  all  of these  times  in  the  youth’s \nconfinement. \nInvolvement  of families  will  be  supported  by  DJJ  by  measures  that  include  placement  of youths \nas  close  to  their  home  community  as  possible  (taking  into  account  all  the  factors  affecting \nplacement  decisions),  regularly  scheduled  family  meetings,  regular  telephone  contact,  assistance \nwith  transportation  for  family  meetings,  and  the  use  of video-conferencing  in  situations  where \nfamily  members  are  not  able  to  travel  to  DJJ  facilities. \nIt  should  be  noted  that  the  definition  of  “family”  varies  considerably  in  different  racial/ethnic \ncommunities  and  that  it  often  extends  beyond  the  nuclear  family.  In  this  Plan,  relevant  family \nmembers  may  include  grandparents,  aunts,  uncles,  neighbors,  religious  officials,  and  other \ncommunity  people.  Engaging  and  involving  individuals  using  this  broad  definition  of family  is \nnot  only  desirable, but  may  be  necessary  for  a  youth  whose  nuclear  family  is  either  unavailable \nor  non-receptive  to  participation  in  the  youth’s  rehabilitation. \nIt  is  recognized  that  in  some  instances  a  youth’s  parents  or  caregivers  may  be  unavailable  due  to \nimpairment,  other  family  priorities,  and/or  other  reasons.  However,  the  majority  of families  are \nlikely  to  be  receptive  to  participating  in  some  aspect  of their  youth’s  rehabilitation.  Small \nincrements  of improvement  by  the  youth  should  be  highlighted  in  interactions  with  family. \nSNsciplinary System \nUnder  the  current  disciplinary  system,  misconduct  is  categorized  into  three  levels:  Level  1, \nminor  misconduct;  Level  2,  intermediate  misconduct;  and  Level  3,  serious  misconduct.  Each \nlevel  of misconduct  is  processed  in  a  different  manner  with  each  having  different  timeframes  and \nlevels  of review  and  response.  Misconduct  that  is  very  serious  in  nature  may  be  referred  to  the \nDistrict  Attorney’s  Office  for possible  prosecution. \nThe  disciplinary  system  includes  a  list  of graduated  sanctions,  including  “time  adds”  for  serious \nmisconduct.  If the  sanction  for  misconduct  includes  a  time  add,  DJJ  can  extend  the  youth’s \nProjected  Board  Date  by  one  to  12  months  (the  maximum  allowed  by  statute  for  any  single \nviolation). \nUnder  state  law,  if a  youth’s  Projected  Board  Date  is  extended  as  a  result  of misconduct,  he  or \nshe  may  earn  back  half of the  time  received  for  the  last  offense  by  remaining  free  of  serious \nmisconduct  for  a  specified  period  of time.  Some  offenses  are  excluded  from  this  “earn  back” \nprovision. \nPage  62\nSuccess  in  the  Ward  Incentives  Plan  can  also  result  in  advancement  of a  Projected  Board  Date  or \noffset  of part  of a  time  add.  This  system  was  modified  in  May  2005  to  allow  youth  to  earn  a \nmaximum  of  15  program  credits  per  month.  Fifteen  program  credits  per  month  is  equal  to \nadvancing  a  Projected  Board  Date  by  one  month  for  every  two  months  of  success  at  the  15-day \nprogram  credit  level.  At  the  time  this  was  written  (June  2006),  232  youth  were  earning  program \ncredits  at  this  level. \nThe issue  of time  adds  and  program  credits  is  discussed  at  further  length  in  the  section  titled \n“Time  Adds,”  below. \nProblems  with  the  Current  Disciplinary  System \nPrior  to  recent  budget  proposals,  five  of the  eight  facilities  do  not  have  a  dedicated  Disciplinary \nCoordinator.  Sanctions  for  Level  3  serious  misconduct  are  often  delayed  due  to  the  workload  of \nthe  investigators,  fact  finders  and  disposition  makers.  This  delay  decreases  the  impact  and \neffectiveness  of the  sanction  in  modifying  behavior. \nThe  lack  of dedicated  Disciplinary  Coordinators  and  support  staff also  adversely  affects  the \nquality  of behavior reports,  investigation  reports,  fact  finding  reports,  and  disposition  reports. \nQuality  is  also  adversely  affected  by  insufficient  training  and  limited  monitoring. \nIn  the  past  the  system  was  not  able  to  address  providing  assistance  for  youth  with  disabilities, \nincluding  youth  with  cognitive  or  other  disabilities  that  limit  reading  and  writing  abilities. \nThe  current  disciplinary  system  does  not  include  an  appeal  process  for  Level  1  minor  misconduct \ndue  to  the  minor  nature  of the  prescribed  sanctions.  However,  minor  misconduct  is  now  being \nused  to  determine  privileges  and  the  ability  to  earn  program  credits,  thus  increasing  the \nconsequences  and  the  need  for  an  appeal  system. \nFinally,  until  recently,  there  has  been  little  or  no  consistency  in  the  program  credits  system \nbetween  or  among  facilities. \nGrievance  System \nThe  intent  of the  Grievance  System  is  to  provide  a  fair,  simple,  and  expeditious  method  for  the \nresolution  of complaints  by  youth  as  required  by  Welfare  and  Institutions  Code  (1766.5.)  There \nare  three  types  of grievances  under  the  current  system:  regular,  emergency  and  staff action.  (The \nlatter  are  complaints  alleging  staff misconduct.)  Each  type  of grievance  is  processed  differently \nwith  each  having  different  timeframes  and  levels  of review  and  response. \nTo  file  a  grievance,  a  youth  obtains  the  appropriate  form  from  the  Grievance  Clerk,  completes \nthe  grievance  and  then  returns  it  to  the  Clerk  for processing.  Under  the  current  system,  the \nGrievance  Clerk  is  a  youth  elected  by  his/her peers. \nProblems  with  Current  Grievance  System \n  \nThere  is  minimal  oversight  and  monitoring  of the  grievance  process  and,  as  a  result,  grievance \nresponses  often  exceed  timeframes,  responses  are  inadequate  and  many  grievances  are  lost  in  the \nprocess.  A  youth  cannot  file  a  grievance  without  obtaining  the  form  from  the  Grievance  Clerk \nand  they  have  no  way  to  ensure  that  the  clerk  submits  the  grievance  for  processing. \nPage  63\nMixing  complaints  alleging  staff misconduct  with  grievances  is  ineffective  and  has  proven  to  be \ndifficult  to  handle  within  the  Grievance  System.  Complaints  alleging  staff misconduct  require  a \nmore  formalized  investigatory  process  than  the  older  tradition  of dispute resolution  that  was  the \norigin  of the  Grievance  System.  The  manner  in  which  complaints  alleging  staff misconduct  are \nprocessed  varies  by  facility. \nTraining  for  staff and  youth  in  the  grievance  system  is  inadequate. \nThe  system  does  not  include  a  process for  youths  with  disabilities  to  submit  grievances  that \nrequest  accommodations  or  allege  discrimination,  nor  does  it  address  providing  assistance  for \nyouths  with  disabilities. \nTime  Adds \nCalifornia  law  directs  DJJ  to  “promulgate  regulations  to  implement  a  table  of  sanctions  to  be \nused  in  determining  parole  consideration  date  extensions”  (Welfare  and  Institutions  Code  1719). \n‘Parole  consideration  date  extensions”  (called  “projected  board  dates”  elsewhere  in  this  Plan)  are \ntime  adds.  Time  adds  may  be  set  by  DJJ  for  a  “sustained  serious  misconduct  violation  if all  other \nsanctioning  options  have  been  considered  and  determined  to  be  unsuitable...”  The  length  of any \nsingle  time  add  can  be  one  to  twelve  months  “based  on  the  seriousness  of the  misconduct,  the \nward's prior  disciplinary  history,  the  ward's  progress  toward  treatment/rehabilitation  objectives, \nthe  ward's  earned  program  credits,  and  any  extenuating  or  mitigating  circumstances.”  The  law \nalso  allows  DJJ  to  develop  regulations  to  establish  a  process  for  enabling  youth  to  earn  back  up \nto  50  percent  of time  adds  acquired  for  disciplinary  matters.  By  departmental  policy,  only  Level \n3  infractions  are  subject  to  time  adds. \nChristopher  Baird,  a  member  of the  Safety  and  Welfare  Planning  Team,  analyzed  the  use  of time \nadds  for  all  first  commitments  since  April  1997  and  for  the  current  (2005)  DJJ  facility \npopulation.  Among  his  conclusions  was  that  in  2005  the  male  youth  in  DJJ  facilities  on  a  new \ncommitment  had  an  average  of about  8.2  months  of time  adds.  With  an  average  length  of stay  on \nanew  commitment  of just  over  36  months,  time  adds  are  therefore  responsible  for  about  23 \npercent  of the  time  young  men  stay  in  DJJ  facilities  (8.2/36  =  .228).  Since  length  of  stay  is \nproportional  to  average  daily  population,  time  adds  are  consequently  responsible  for  about  23 \npercent  of the  non-parole  violator  male  population  in  DJJ  facilities. \nNo  other  state  has  a  longer  extended  age  of jurisdiction  for juvenile  offenders  than  California. \nThis  lengthy  extended  age  of jurisdiction,  combined  with  extensive  use  of time  adds,  contributes \nto  the  longest  reported  average  length  of stay  in  a  nationwide  survey  conducted  by  the  Council  of \nJuvenile  Correctional  Administrators.  For  males,  California’s  2004  average  length  of  stay  of 25.9 \nmonths®  was  nearly  three  times  as  long  as  the  average  for  the  19  states  that  took  part  in  the \nsurvey.  The  accompanying  chart  shows  the  average  length  of stay  for  the  states  that  reported \ndata. \n  \n° This  average includes parole  violators  who  have  a much  shorter average length of stay than new  commitments. \nPage  64\nAverage  Length  of  Stay in  Months \n2004  - Males \nWest Virginia  1.8 \nSouth  Dakota  2.5 \nGeorgia  2.9 \nMinnesota  3.0 \nOregon  5.8 \nHawaii  5.9 \nNew Jersey  6.0 \nConnecticut  6.1 \nIdaho  6.8 \nMichigan  7.5 \n  \nArizona  8.9 \nWashington  9.2 \nAVERAGE  (I 9.4 \nMissouri  10.4 \nVirginia  13.1 \nNorth Carolina  13.1 \nTennessee  13.7 \nTexas  17.4 \nColorado  19.3 \nCalifornia |  25.9 \n0  5  10  15  20  25  30 \nAccess  to  Court  and  Law  Library \nDJJ  policy  mandates  that,  irrespective  of program  status,  a  youth  will  not  be  denied  or  obstructed \nin  his/her  efforts  to  obtain  legal  materials  and  present  a  petition  or  legal  document  to  the  courts. \nYouth  and  departmental  staff are  provided  information  regarding  new  court  decisions  which  are \nidentified  by  the  departmental  legal  office  as  affecting  a  substantial  number  of youth.  The \nfundamental  constitutional  right  of access  to  courts  requires  DJJ  to  assist  youth  in  the  preparation \nand  filing  of meaningful  legal  papers  by  providing  them  with adequate  legal  libraries  or  adequate \nassistance  from  persons  trained  in  law. \nPolicy  further  stipulates  that  staff may  not  subject  visits  between  an  attorney  and  his/her  client  to \nauditory  supervision.  To  the  extent  practicable,  attorney  visits  take  place  in  a  private  room. \nWhere  such  a  room  is  not  available,  the  attorney  visit  may  occur  in  a  regular  visiting  room, \nprovided  the  youth  and  his/her  attorney  have  a  degree  of  separation  from  other  visitors. \nThe  Superintendent  must  allow  a  youth  to  contact  and retain  attorneys.  Furthermore,  the \nSuperintendent  may  not  apply  frequency  limitations  on  youth’s  telephone  calls  to  attorneys  when \nthe  youth  demonstrates  that  communication  with  attorneys  by  correspondence,  visiting,  or \nnormal  telephone  use  is  not  adequate. \nThe  Department  provides  each  youth  with  several  methods  to  maintain  confidential  contact  with \nhis/her  attorney.  For  example: \ne  Attorney-client  correspondence  is  covered  under  the  non-reviewable  mail  provisions; \nPage  65\ne  Private  visits  with  attorneys  are  provided;  and \ne  Youth  are  afforded  the  opportunity  to  place  an  occasional  unmonitored  call  to  their \nattorney. \nProblems  with  the  Current  System  of Court  and  Law  Library  Access \nCurrently,  there  is  no  startup  or refresher  training  for  facility  staff concerning  providing  access  to \nthe  law  library  and  courts. \nBoth  the  Orientation  Packet  and  the  Youthful  Offenders’  Rights  Handbook  lack  information \nregarding  access  to  the  law  library  and  courts. \nLaw  libraries  are  managed  by  two  branches  of DJJ:  Education  handles  operations  and \nInstitutions  and  Camps  administers  the  budget.  This  creates  a  lack  of coordination. \nThe  Division’s  law  libraries  currently  use  printed  text  that  poses  problems  with  storage,  dated \nmaterials,  and  acquisition  of new  and/or  revised  materials. \nAttorneys  for  youth  have  expressed  concern  over  attorney  telephone  and  visiting  access. \nAccess  to  Religious  Services  and  Programs \nDJJ  recognizes  the  constitutional  and  statutory  rights  of youth  to  hold  religious  convictions  and \npractice  religion.  By  policy,  all  youth  are  afforded  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  participate  in \nreligious  services  and  programs.  Exercise  of religion  without  discrimination  or  preference  is \nguaranteed  unless  it  is  inconsistent  with  the  safety  and/or  security  of the  facility. \nDJJ  staff have a  legal  obligation  to  ensure  that  youth  are  afforded  their  constitutional  and \nstatutory  rights  and  must  allow  access  to  religious  services/programs  without  prejudice  or \npreferences  to  all  youth,  regardless  of level  or program  status. \nDJJ  revised  its  policy  on  religion  in  2003  to  be  consistent  with  The  Religious  Land  Use  and \nInstitutionalized  Person  Act  (RLUIPA).  The  revised  policy  was  submitted  to  all  facilities  for \nmandatory  training  of all  staff affected  by  the  implementation.  This  training  was  completed  in \nearly  summer  2003  and  the  revised  policy  was  implemented  September  1,  2003. \nProblems  with  the  Current  System \n  \nThere  is  no  dedicated  position  to  provide  oversight  of religious  programs  and  functions.  There  is \nno  system  to  monitor  access  to  religious  programs  or  demonstrate  compliance  with  the  law. \nAn  audit  completed  in  March  2005  identified  the  following  staff  attitudes  and  beliefs  about \nreligious  rights  for  youth: \ne  Some  staff are  “suspect”  of a  youth’s  religious  belief. \ne  Some  staff view  use  of the  “Change  of Faith  Form”  by  some  youth  as  a  manipulative  tool \nto  disrupt  the  safety  and  security  of the  facility. \ne  Some  staff believe  that  youths  on  the  lowest  program  level  can  be  denied  religious \nservices. \nPage  66\nThe  same  audit  determined  that  religious  services  schedules  are  sometimes  in  conflict  with  other \nmandated  services  and  that  some  staff and  religious  providers  do  not  consistently  enter \ninformation  into  the  Ward  Information  Network  (WIN)  system. \nVolunteers  for  some  belief  systems,  such  as  Jehovah  Witness,  are  lacking  in  many  facilities. \nThe  Youthful  Offenders’  Rights  Handbook  does  not  include  specific  information  regarding \nreligious  access. \nPhysical  Plant  Improvements \nThere  is  great  variability  in  the  condition  of buildings  and  grounds  between  facilities  and,  often, \nwithin  facilities.  While  much  of the  deteriorated  physical  condition  of many  of the  buildings  can \nbe  attributed  to  age,  conditions  such  as  poor  sanitation,  graffiti,  peeling  paint,  and  dark  dreary \nrooms  and  corridors,  cannot.  The  same  can  be  said  for  outdoor  recreation  yards  closed  because \nof holes  from  ground  squirrels. \nSituations  where  there  are  clean,  bright,  well-maintained  living  units  in  close  proximity  to  dirty, \ndark,  neglected  units  suggests  that,  at  least  at  some  facilities,  the  standards  of living  unit  staff \nhave  more  to  do  with  physical  plant  condition  than  senior  management — either  at  the  facility,  or \nin  central  office. \nMaster  Planning \nJuvenile  Justice  Operational  Master  Plan \nDJJ  recognizes  that  what  happens  to  a  youth  after  release  from  confinement,  and  what  resources \nare  available  in  the  community  to  promote  success  and  intervene  before  little  problems  become \nmajor  problems,  is  central  to  the  success  of juvenile justice  reform.  At  the  same  time,  it  has  not \nbeen  possible  within  the  time  and  resources  available  to  address  deficiencies  and  develop  a \nreform  plan  for parole  and  community  services. \nDJJ  also  recognizes  that  keeping  a  youth  close  to  his  or  her  family  and  community  whenever \npossible,  and  providing  quality  services  locally, improves  outcomes  and  reduces  the  number  of \nyouth  in  state  confinement. \nAs  noted  above,  under  “Acceptance/Rejection  Criteria,”  these  issues  are  also  related  to  the \ncentral  question  of who  should  be  committed  to  state  confinement. \nA  Juvenile  Justice  Operational  Master  Plan  for  the  State  of California  is  needed  to  address  these \nbroader  questions.  By  involving  county  participation,  as  well  as  participation  by  other  interested \nstakeholders,  the  Juvenile  Justice  Operational  Master  Plan  can  become  the  vehicle to  create \ncomprehensive juvenile justice  reform  in  California.  Among  the  issues  that  might  be  addressed \nin  such  a  plan  are: \ne  Common  risk/needs  assessment  definitions  used  by  both  the  state  and  county juvenile \njustice  agencies. \ne  A  profile  of the  youth  population  at  both  the  local  and  state  level  by  risk  and  needs  to  the \nextent  that  information  is  available \ne  Identification  of resources  available  locally  to  meet  the  needs  of youths \nPage  67\ne  Identification  of services  and  programs  that  the  DJJ  can  develop/improve  to  meet  the \nneeds  of high  risk  youth  who  cannot  be  served  locally. \ne  Evidence-based  prevention  and  early  intervention  programs  delivered  in  the  community \nthat  are  designed  to  reduce  future  criminal  behavior \ne  Cost  sharing  of prevention  and  early  intervention  programs  in  proportion  to  avoided \nfuture  costs  to  state  and  local  government. \nIdentification  of the  reasons  why  lower  risk  youth  are  sent  to  DJJ. \nCreating  alternative  placements  for  lower-risk/high-need  youth  in  the  community. \ne  Creating  secure  regional  treatment/rehabilitation  centers  as  alternatives  to  state \nconfinement. \ne  State  subsidy  of local  treatment/rehabilitation  programs  when  they  are  alternatives  to \nstate  confinement. \ne  Review  and  revision  of the  sliding  fee  schedule  for  commitments  to  DJJ. \ne  Lowering  the  extended  age  of jurisdiction  for juvenile  offenders  in  line  with  practices  in \nthe  vast  majority  of  states. \ne  Developing  transitional  facilities  and  programs  for  parolees —  including  short  term  secure \nconfinement,  day  reporting,  and  alternative  schools. \ne  Developing a  full  range  of graduated  sanctions  for  technical  parole  violations. \nSuch  a  plan  should  be  a  first  step.  Intake/rejection  criteria  may  change  over  time  in  response  to \nincreased  capability  at  the  state  or  local  level,  or  both.  Consequently,  this  dynamic  process \nshould  continue  as  collaboration  between  the  state  and  local  components  of the  California \njuvenile justice  system  improves  and  matures. \nFacilities  Master  Plan \nGood  programs  can  take  place  in  bad  buildings  —  but  it  is  harder  to  do  and  harder  still  to  sustain. \nUnfortunately,  given  the  age,  condition  and  design  of DJJ’s  facilities,  reform  will  first  have  to \ntake  place  under  less  than  ideal  circumstances.  Planning  for  replacement  of these  facilities  needs \nto  begin  now. \nDJJ  has  begun  planning  for  a  new  prototypical juvenile  correctional  facility.  While  this  is  an \nimportant  step,  a  broader  statewide  planning  effort  is  needed.  With  the  exception  of Chaderyjian, \nall  of DJJ’s  facilities  have  long  exceeded  their  useful  life.  None  of DJJ’s  existing  facilities  meets \nthe  long-term  programmatic  needs  set  forth  in  this  plan. \nThe  kind  of facilities  master  plan  needed  for  DJJ  is  less  about  architecture  and  engineering  than \nit  is  about  a  systematic  description  and  quantification  of future  facility  needs  based  on  a \nprojection  of future  demand,  demographics,  projected  program  needs,  and  the  geographical \ndistribution  of commitments.  Planning  for  future  living  units  will  be  based  on  contemporary \nstandards  of care  for juvenile  correctional  populations.  Living  unit  size  in  new  facilities  for  core \nprogram  units  will  be  guided  by  national  standards  for juvenile  correctional  facilities  and  the \nrisks  and  needs  of the  population  and  will  be  in  the  range  of  16  to  25  youth  for  general  core \nprogram  living  units.  Living  units  for  special  populations  will  be  smaller.  The  size  of units  for \nspecial  populations  will  be  guided  by  national  standards  for juvenile  correctional  facilities  and,  if \nstandards  are  not  available,  the  recommendations  of national  experts. \nPage  68\nThe  facilities  master  plan  will  address  the  deficiencies  identified  in  this  Plan  and  be  coordinated \nwith  the juvenile justice  operational  master plan  described  above.  The  results  of that  process  will \naffect  the  size,  nature,  and  location  of future  demand.  It  will  also  likely  expand  the  facilities \nrequirements  of DJJ  by  highlighting  the  need  for  community  based  transitional  facilities  for \nparolees.  Finally,  the  facilities  master  plan  will  also  highlight  the  need  for  variations  on  the \ninitial  prototypical  design  on  which  the  agency  is  presently  working. \nACTION  PLANS \nAcceptance/Rejection  Criteria \n1.  DJJ  will  promulgate  a  process  and  criteria  for  determining  whether  youth  with  certain \nmedical  conditions,  persistent  and  serious  mental  health  care  needs  and/or  developmental \ndisabilities  are  accepted  into  DJJ  for  potential  material  benefit,  by  September  1,  2006. \nDJJ  will  designate  Community/Court  Liaison  staff,  as  described  above,  by  December  1, \n2006. \nDJJ  will  clarify  its  policies  to  accept  only  youth  who  are  appropriate  for  the  state's  facilities \n(1.e.,  those  who  are  higher  risk/higher  need)  and  will  work  with  the  counties  to  develop \nstrategies  to  ensure  that  youth  who  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for  commitment  to  DJJ,  but  have \nexhausted  all  local  options,  are  appropriately  served.  This  will  be  accomplished  by  a  date  to \nbe  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan. \nDJJ  will  begin  working  with  counties  on  statewide  definitions  related  to  \"risks\"  and  \"needs\" \nand  will  explore  long-term  strategies  for  conducting  initial  classification/assessment  while \nthe  youth  is  in  county  custody.  This  will  be  accomplished  by  a  date  to  be  specified  in  the \nStandards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan. \nDJJ  will  work  with  counties  to  analyze  the  effectiveness  of the  current  \"sliding  scale\"  fee \nschedule  and,  if  appropriate,  make  recommendations  for  alternative  strategies  to  better  serve \nthe  state's  public  safety  needs.  This  will  be  accomplished  by  a  date  to  be  specified  in  the \nStandards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan. \nOrientation \n1.  DJJ  will  standardize  orientation  processes  for  all  youth  and  add  material  on  victim  impact \nand  restitution,  the  disciplinary  system,  and  on  the  positive  incentives  program. \n2.  DJJ  will  develop  strategies  to  improve  outreach  and  inclusion  of parents  and  families \nimmediately  upon  a  youth’s  commitment  to  DJJ. \nAs  described  above  in  the  Action  Plan  for  Acceptance/Rejection  Criteria,  DJJ  will  hire \nCommunity/Court  Liaison  positions  who,  among  other  things,  will  educate  families, \nprobation,  and  court  personnel  about  DJJ  programs  and  services  so  that  families  are  advised \nabout  what  to  expect  once  their  child  is  sent  to  DJJ  and  informed  about  how  to  remain \ninvolved  in  their  child’s  rehabilitation/treatment. \nPending  available  resources,  DJJ  will  provide  orientation  at  the  county/juvenile  hall  level. \nInformation  provided  there  will  give  youths  an  opportunity  to  learn  about  and  understand  the \nPage  69\nresources  available  within  DJJ.  Reliable  information  should  help  alleviate  youth’s  fears  and \ndispel  the  myths  about  DJJ. \nDJJ  will  improve  orientation  by  developing  curriculum,  providing  training,  and  updating  the \nYouthful  Offenders’  Rights  Handbook.  All  materials  used  for  orientation  to  DJJ  (as  opposed \nto  facility  orientation  materials)  will  be  standardized. \nFamily  Involvement \n1.  By  July  1,  2007,  DJJ  will  begin  conducting  Community  Assessment  Reports  for  each  youth \nat  intake  which  will  include  contacts  and  interviews  with  parents,  close  relatives  and \ncommunity  service  providers  who  are  available  and  willing  and  who  can  provide  significant \ninformation  about  the  youth.  The  Community  Assessment  Reports  will  include  measures  to \nassess  family  background,  strengths,  and  functioning. \nBy  November  1,  2006,  telephone  contact  between  the  youth  and  his/her  family  will  be \nfacilitated  within  24  hours  of arrival  at  the  reception  center  to  assist  the  youth  in  the  early \nadjustment  to  his/her  confinement.  By  December  1,  2006,  ongoing  telephone  contact \nbetween  the  youth  and  his/her  family  will  be  facilitated  on  a  regular  basis  during  the  entire \nperiod  of the  youth’s  confinement. \nStrong  efforts  will  be  made  to  maintain  contact  with  and  engage  the  youth’s  family  after \nplacement  in  the  appropriate  DJJ  facility.  DJJ  will  consult  with  a  nationally  recognized \nexpert  to  develop  a  model  for  re-entry  and  transition  services  that  are  strength-based  and \nfamily  focused.  This  model  will  be  phased  in  as  facilities  are  converted  under  this  Plan. \nDJJ  will  organize  quarterly  “Family  Visiting  Days”  to  encourage  further  participation  of \nfamilies  in  the  youth’s  treatment/rehabilitation  at  a  date  to  be  specified  in  the  Standards  and \nCriteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan. \nD isciplinar y  System \nBy  the  dates  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section  of this  Remedial  Plan: \n1.  DJJ  will  hire  Disciplinary  Coordinators  and  support  staff for  all  facilities  that  currently  do  not \nhave  them.  Training  for  Disciplinary  Coordinators  and  others  involved  in  the  disciplinary \nsystem  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  as  needed.  A  standard  duty  statement  will  be  written  for \nDisciplinary  Coordinators.  New  hires  and  current  disciplinary  staff will  receive  full  or \nrefresher  training  on  a  competency  basis. \nAlong  with  this  expansion  of resources,  the  length  of time  it  takes  to  process  Level  3  serious \nmisconduct  cases  will  be  reduced.  For  fact  finding  hearings,  instead  of 24  days,  the \nmaximum  time  before  a  hearing  is  held  will  be  reduced  to  14  days.  The  current  standard  of \n14  days  for  disposition  hearings  will  be  reduced  to  seven  days. \nDJJ  will  provide  assistance  for  youth  with disabilities  consistent  with  the  Wards  with \nDisabilities  Remedial  Plan. \nDJJ  will  add  a  process  for  appeals  of Level  |  infractions. \nDJJ  will  develop  a  standard  for presentation  of court  cases  to  district  attorneys. \nPage  70\n6.  DJJ  will  increase  the  ability  for  youths  to  earn  back  disciplinary  time  with  good  behavior. \n(See  “Time  Adds,”  below.)  Eligibility  for restoration  of disciplinary  time  will  be  reviewed  at \neach  youth’s  case  conference. \n7.  DJJ  will  take  steps  to  promote  participation  in  the  Ward  Incentives  Plan  and  to  standardize \nand  expand  the  ability  to  earn  incentive  points  through  restorative justice  projects.  (See \n“Time  Adds,”  below.) \n8.  The  Chief Deputy  Secretary  will  establish  a  team  of internal  and  external  experts  to  develop \na  broader  array  of graduated  sanctions  and  to  propose  additional  positive  incentives.  This \nteam  will  explore  the  possibility  of further  reducing  projected  board  date  extensions  as  a \ndisciplinary  measure  in  the  long-term. \nGrievance  System \nThe  following  will  be  accomplished  by  the  dates  specified  in  the  Standards  and  Criteria  Section \nof this  Remedial  Plan: \n1.  Forms  on  which  to  file  grievances  or  complaints  alleging  staff misconduct  will  be  made \navailable  on  all  living  units  in  a  location  accessible  to  youths  without  requiring  assistance \nfrom  staff or  clerks. \n2.  A  lock  box  will  be  installed  on  every  living  unit  for  submission  of forms  to  prevent  lost \ngrievances. \n3.  The  role  of the  clerk  will  be  redefined  to  ensure  this  position  is  no  longer  responsible  for \nissuing,  recording,  submitting  and  tracking  grievances,  but  rather  is  responsible  for  ensuring \nthat  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of forms  on  the  living  unit  and  educating  and  assisting  youths \nin  the  grievance  process. \n4.  Youths  will  be  notified  upon  receipt  of grievances  and  complaints  alleging  staff misconduct. \n5.  Each  facility  will  have  one  or  more  grievance  coordinator  who,  among  other  things,  will \nprepare  monthly  reports  on  grievances  and  grievance  trends  for  use  of the  superintendent  and \nhis/her  management  team.  The  design  and  content  of these  reports  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation  with  the  Safety  and  Welfare  Court  Expert.  The  superintendent  will  review  all \nallegations  of staff misconduct. \n6.  A  process  will  be  developed  to  address  abuse  of  the  grievance  system  with  regard  to \nexcessive  filing,  inappropriate  statements  (profanity,  obscene  language),  excessive  verbiage \n(pointless  verbiage  or  voluminous  unrelated  documentation),  and  lack  of  cooperation  (refusal \nto  be  interviewed  or  cooperate  with  the  reviewer). \n7.  Monitoring  will  be  improved  at  the  facilities  by  scanning,  tracking  and  monitoring  all \ngrievances  and  complaints  alleging  staff misconduct,  as  well  as  by  collecting  and  presenting \ndata  to  the  local  management  team  on  a  monthly  basis  for  review  of trends  and  development \nof intervention  strategies.  Weekly  and  monthly  reports  will  be  developed  and  automated. \nPage  71\nHeadquarters  will  improve  oversight  by  reviewing  timeframes  and  quality  of responses  on  a \nregular/random  basis  as  well  as  by  collecting  and  evaluating  data,  reporting  findings,  and \nassisting  facility  staff with  the  development  of action  plans  to  address  deficiencies. \nA  standardized  duty  statement  will  be  developed  for  staff responsible  for  monitoring  and \nprocessing  grievances.  Duties  will  include  monitoring  timeframes,  reviewing  and  ensuring \nadequate  responses,  training  staff,  holding  monthly  meetings,  training  grievance  clerks, \npreparing  reports,  reviewing  data  for  trends,  developing  intervention  strategies,  and \nconducting  inquiries  into  complaints  alleging  staff misconduct. \n10.  Complaints  alleging  staff misconduct  will  be  separated  from  grievances. \n11.  All  staff whose job  responsibilities  include  direct,  ongoing  contact  with  youths  will  be \ntrained  on  the  Grievance  System.  Staff responsible  for  tracking,  monitoring,  conducting \ninquiries  and  responding to  grievances  will  be  provided  specialized  training. \n12.  Orientation  will  be  improved  by  developing  curriculum,  providing  training,  and  updating  the \nYouthful  Offenders’  Rights  Handbook. \n13.  Youths  with  disabilities  who  require  accommodations,  including  youths  with  cognitive  or \nother  disabilities  that  limit  reading  and  writing  abilities,  will  be  provided  assistance  in  the \ngrievance  process  consistent  with  the  Wards  with  Disabilities  Remedial  Plan.  Staff who \nassist  youths  with  disabilities  and  staff who  respond  to  grievances  filed  by  youths  with \ndisabilities  will  be  provided  adequate  training  consistent  with  the  Wards  with  Disabilities \nRemedial  Plan. \nTime  Adds \nIt  is  anticipated  that  time  adds  will  become  much  less  frequent  as  Safety  and  Welfare  Plan \nreforms  are  implemented.  As  DJJ  moves  to  a  rehabilitative  model,  positive  incentives  will \nsignificantly  exceed  negative  incentives.  The  following  steps  will  be  taken: \n1.  Effective  immediately,  when  disciplinary  time  adds  are  being  considered  for  youth  exhibiting \nsignificant  mental  health  issues,  a  mental  health  staff familiar  with  the  youth  will  determine \nif the  behavior  for  which  a  disciplinary  time  add  is  being  considered  is  related  to  the  youth’s \nunderlying  mental  illness  or  its  treatment.  Upon  a  positive  determination,  the  mental  health \nstaff will  be  responsible  for  determining  the  appropriate  disposition. \nDJJ  will  expand  its  earned  program  credit  policy  to  allow  youths  (not  excluded  by  policy \nfrom  the  50  percent  earn  back  provision  described  below)  to  contract  for  program  credits  in \nan  amount  not  to  exceed  the  number  of months  added  to  his/her  parole  board  date  for \ndisciplinary  reasons.  Conditions  to  be  met  to  earn  such  program  credits  are  to  be  recorded  in \na  behavior  contract  signed  by  the  youth,  the  senior  supervisor  in  the  youth’s  living  unit,  and \nothers  as  deemed  necessary  or  appropriate.  Conditions  are  to  be  based  on  successful \nimprovement  in  specific  behaviors  tailored  to  the  youth’s  developmental  stage,  abilities,  and \nbehavioral  issues.  Conditions  are  to  be  specific  and  realistically  attainable  by  the  youth  in \nquestion.  Time  periods  for  performance  will  be  relatively  short.  They  should  be  proportional \nto,  but  not  exceed,  the  length  of the  time  add.  An  appropriate  range  of time  periods  will  be \nPage  72\nspecified  by  policy.  Conditions  will  require  positive  conduct,  not just  the  absence  of \nmisconduct. \nWhenever  possible,  youth  correctional  counselors  and  others  who  come  in  contact  with  the \nyouth  are  to  coach  him  or  her  in  strategies  to  help  successfully  meet  the  conditions  of the \ncontract. \n3.  DJJ  will  revise  the  earn  back  policy  for  time  adds  so  that  50  percent  of disciplinary  time  adds \ncan  be  earned  back  following  six  consecutive  months  of good  behavior,  except  for  those \nbehaviors  excluded  from  current  policy.’  This  provision  shall  not  preclude  any  youth  from \nearning  program  credits  as  described  above.  In  addition,  if the  youth’s  Projected  Board  Date \nis  extended  an  odd  number  of months,  DJJ  will  revise  its  policy  so  that  the  number  of months \nrestored  would  be  rounded  up,  rather  than  down.  Both  parts  of this  proposal  will  be \nimplemented  as  part  of this  Plan. \n4.  DJJ  will  increase  offsets  to  time  adds  through  increased  use  of positive  reinforcement  for \ngood  behavior. \nDJJ  has  a  system —  the  Ward  Incentive  Program  —  that,  among  other  things,  provides  for  an \naccelerated  projected  board  date  as  an  incentive  for  good  behavior.  The  Ward  Incentive \nProgram  was  modified  by  DJJ  in  2005  to  allow  a  youth  to  earn  up  to  15  days  of  “program \ncredit”  a  month.  For  every  30  days  of program  credit  earned,  the  youth’s  Projected  Board \nDate  is  advanced  by  one  month.  In  theory,  this  allows  a  youth  to  cut  the  time  to  his  or  her \nProjected  Board  Date  in  half.  Program  credits  can  also  be  used  to  reduce  the  maximum \namount  of time  added  due  to  a  disciplinary  action. \nThere  are  three  levels  in  the  Ward  Incentive  Program.  In  the  highest  level  (Level  A)  a  youth \nearns  between  11  and  15  days  of program  credit  each  month.  A  youth  on  Incentive  Level  B \ncan  earn  up  to  nine  program  credits  per  month.  On  Level  C,  the  maximum  is  six. \nOn  Level  A,  to  receive  15  days  of program  credit,  a  youth  must  have  no  documented  gang \nactivity  in  the  last  six  months  and  meet  the  following  criteria  for  the  previous  30  days: \na.  have  no  sustained  Level  III  or  any  serious  Level  II  infractions® \nb.  have  at  least  27  days  free  of any  DDMS  action  (1.e.  no  Level  I  infractions) \nc.  be  either  a)  making  satisfactory  progress  toward  a  high  school  diploma,  b)  pursuing \ncollege  classes  and  working  part  time  with  positive  evaluations,  or  c)  working  full- \ntime  with  positive  evaluations  (high  school  graduates  only) \nd.  meet  all  applicable  treatment  requirements  such  as  completing journal  work  in  a \ntimely  manner,  meeting  Individual  Change  and  Accountability  Plan  goals  and \nparticipating  in  small  groups,  acknowledging  that  past behavior  was  criminal,  and \nparticipating  in  specialized  treatment  if required  and  available. \nOn  Level  B,  to  receive  up  to  nine  program  credits  per  month,  during  the  previous  30  days  a \nyouth  may  have \n  \n™“Good behavior”  is  defined  as  lack of involvement in  serious  misconduct  (i.e.  no  Level  3  infractions).  Prior policy \nrequired  12  months  good behavior to  earn back half of the  time  added. \n* “Serious  Level II”  infractions  are defined in policy. \nPage  73\nno  sustained  Level  III  infractions \nno  sustained  serious  Level  II  infractions \nno  more  than  two  sustained  (less  serious)  Level  II  infractions \nat  least  20  days  without  DDMS  activity  (1.e.  no  Level  I  infractions  for  at  least  20  of \nthe  last  30  days) \nThe  policy  is  unclear  about  school,  work,  and  treatment  requirements  to  receive  Level  B  or  C \nprogram  credits. \nThe  Ward  Incentive  Program  also  allows  superintendents  to  approve  additional  incentive \npoints  for  restorative justice  projects.  While  the  program  description  provides  examples  of \nsuch  projects,  it  provides  no  guidance  as  to  how  many  incentive  points  can  or  should  be \nawarded  for  restorative justice  work. \nChanges  and  improvements  need  to  be  made  to  the  Ward  Incentive  Program  in  order  to \nincrease  participation  and  the  number  of program  credits  earned.  DJJ  will  develop  means  to \nincrease  participation  and  the  number  of program  credits  earned  by  implementing  the \nfollowing  changes: \ne  The  description  of the  Ward  Incentive  Program  will  be  simplified.  Posters,  flyers,  and \nhandouts  to  promote  understanding  and  participation  will  be  created  and  distributed. \nOnce  a  clear  narrative  description  is  written,  DJJ  may  use  a  competition  for  youths  to \ncreate  posters  and  flyers  describing  and  promoting  the  program.  If used,  this \ncompetition  will  be  a  restorative justice  project  for  which  program  credits  can  be \nearned.  DJJ  may  repeat  the  competition  from  time  to  time  to  create  new  posters  and \nflyers. \ne  DJJ  will  provide  full  program  credit  when  failure  to  participate  in  school,  work,  or \ntreatment  occurs  through  no  fault  of the  youth. \ne  Standards  will  be  developed  for  award  of incentive  points  for restorative justice \nprojects.  For  example,  working  x  hours  on  a  restorative justice  project  might  be  worth \none  program  credit,  participating  in  a  blood  drive  might  be  worth  several  credits,  etc. \nThere  is  no  tracking  system  in  place  to  measure  changes  in  the  net  amount  of time  added  to \nProjected  Board  Dates.  Acceleration  of Projected  Board  Dates  through  the  Ward  Incentive \nProgram  should  be  considered  an  offset  to  time  adds.  To  measure  this,  DJJ  will  develop  a  system \nto  simultaneously  report  on  time  extensions  by  type  of time  add  and  accelerated  projected  board \ndates.  A  separate  report  will  be  prepared  every  month  for  each  facility  and  for  the  division  as  a \nwhole.  Each  report  will  show  the  total  number of months  of time  adds  by  type  of time  add  for \nthat  month  and  for  the  year  to  date,  the  total  number  of months  of accelerated  projected  board \ndates  as  a  result  of earned  program  credits  and  restoration  of disciplinary  time  for  that  month  and \nfor  the  year to  date,  and  the  net  amount  of disciplinary  time  added  (or  subtracted)  for  the  month \nand  for  the  year.  These  reports  will  show  data  both  numerically  and  graphically  and  be  included \nas  part  of the  regular  agenda  at  staff meetings  at  facilities  and  headquarters. \nDJJ  research  will  conduct  an  analysis  of program  time  adds  and  identify  the  reasons,  and  the \nfrequency  of these  reasons,  for  them.  DJJ  will  use  this  analysis  to  develop  a  plan  to  address  the \nPage  74\nneeds  identified  in  the  analysis.  The  goal  of this  plan  will  be  to  reduce  the  frequency  and \nduration  of time  adds  based  on  inadequate  access  to  programs. \nAccess  to  Court  and  Law  Library \nDJJ  will  ensure  that  youths  are  aware  of their  rights  regarding  access  and  that  each  library  has  a \nfull  complement  of updated  legal  materials  by  making  the  following  changes: \n1.  Education  Services  Branch  (ESB)  will  assume  full  responsibility  for  the  operations  of DJJ \nlaw  libraries,  including  the  budget.  ESB  will  track  the  need  for  updated/current  materials, \nmanage  the  budget  regarding  purchases,  ensure  the  development  and  submission  of invoices \nto  the  accounting  office,  and  conduct  annual  audits  of access  and  materials  compliance. \n2.  DJJ  will  revise  the  Youthful  Offenders’  Rights  Handbook  and  orientation  program  to  include \ninformation regarding  access  to  the  law  library  and  attorneys,  specifically  addressing \nconcerns  raised  in  the  Expert’s  Report,  Summer  2001. \n3.  DJJ  will  conduct  annual  School  Site  audits  to  determine  compliance  and  will  purchase \nneeded  law  library  materials. \n4.  DJJ  will  develop  a  tracking  system  within  WIN  to  indicate  the  number  of times  the  law \nlibrary  is  used  at  each  site  and  whether  a  youth  visited  the  library  or  information  was \ngathered  for  him/her. \n5.  DJJ  will  replace  existing  print  libraries  with  either  electronic  (CD)  or  internet  libraries. \n6.  DJJ  will  develop  clear  and  consistent  policies  and  procedures  regarding  access  to  courts  and \nlaw  library  and  will  develop  compliance  measurements  for  monitoring  performance  in  the \narea  of access  to  courts. \n7.  DJJ  will  develop,  and  train  staff on,  curriculum  addressing  access  to  courts  and  law  library. \nIn  addition  to  the  initial  training,  refresher  training  will  be  developed. \n8.  DJJ  will  develop  a  plan  in  consultation  with  plaintiffs  counsel  and  attorneys  for  youth  to \nensure  appropriate  access  to  attorney  visits  and  phone  calls. \nAccess  to  Religious  Programs  and  Functions \nDJJ  will  ensure  that  the  existing  religious  policy  complies  with  current  law  and  that  staff are \nknowledgeable  about  DJJ's  policies  and  practices  pertaining  to  access  to  religious  services  and \nprograms.  DJJ  will  ensure  that  youths  are  aware  of their  rights  and  are  made  aware  of the \npractices  pertaining  to  access  to  religious  services  and  programs.  DJJ  will  take  the  following \nsteps  to  accomplish  this. \n1.  DJJ  will  have  a  system  in  place  to  provide  oversight  to  monitor  and  ensure  compliance  with \npolicies  and  regulations  regarding  Access  to  Religious  Programs  in  a  Correctional  Setting. \n2.  A  Religious  Coordinator  will  oversee  uniform  enforcement  of legally  mandated  religious \nprogramming  to  youths  in  all  DJJ  facilities.  The  Religious  Coordinator  will  also  monitor  all \nfacilities  through  WIN  and  field  visits  to  ensure  that: \nPage  75\nReligious  services/programs  are  provided  for  various  faith  groups. \nAll  youth  have  access  to  religious  services/programs  and  materials. \nThere  is  proper  documentation  of  services/programs  in  WIN. \nState,  Federal  (Faith  Based  Initiative),  and  other  grants  are  pursued. \nThe  Department  is  represented  at  various  interdepartmental  meetings,  professional \nchaplain  organizations,  and  conferences  such  as  the  State  Advisory  Council  on \nInstitutional  Religion  (SACIR),  Association  of Chaplains  in  State  Services  (ACESS) \nand  Bureau  of Prisons  (BOP). \ne  An  Internship  Program  for  DJJ's  chaplaincy  is  developed. \nThe  Religious  Coordinator  will  also  be  responsible  for  oversight  of religious  policy,  manual \nrevisions,  and  chaplain  training. \nDJJ  will  revise  the  Youthful  Offenders’  Rights  Handbook  to  reflect  changes  in  policy  and \nregulations.  The  Handbook  will  be  a  primary  vehicle  for  informing  youth  in  DJJ  of their \nconstitutional  religious  rights  and  how  they  may  practice  their beliefs  within  the  correctional \nenvironment.  The  revised  Handbook  will  be  available  to  youth  on  all  living  units  and  will \ninclude  information  such  as: \ne  Procedure  to  sign  up for  any  religious  services/programs  in  Core  Rehabilitation/ \nTreatment  units. \ne  Procedure  to  sign  up  for  any  religious  services  while  in  Behavior  Treatment  Programs \nor  special  treatment  program. \ne  How  to  obtain  access  to  chaplains. \ne  What  personal  religious  materials  are  permitted. \ne  How  to  notify  staff/chaplains  of  special  religious  needs  (dietary,  identification,  etc.). \n4.  Refresher  training  will  be  developed  and  provided  to  staff on  revisions  to  the  religious \nprogramming  policy,  reporting  requirements,  and  modifications  to  WIN. \nPhysical  Plant  Improvements \nAll  youths  will  be  housed  in  rooms  and  buildings  that  are  clean,  well  lighted  and  graffiti \nfree.  Occupied  single  rooms  will  have  a  fully  functioning  sink  and  toilet  and  adequate \nheat  and  ventilation.  Common  showers,  lavatories,  toilets  and  urinals  are  to  be  clean,  well \nlighted,  and  adequately  heated  and  ventilated.  DJJ  will  take  the  following  steps  to  ensure \nthat  this  happens. \n1.  The  Director  of Juvenile  Facilities  will  provide  a  quarterly  report  to  the  Chief Deputy \nSecretary  outlining  a  complete  inspection  of DJJ  facilities,  identifying  deficient  sanitary  and \nphysical  conditions  by  type  and  location  and  including  recommendations  to  remedy  those \ndeficiencies.  The  Chief Deputy  Secretary  will  provide  an  annual  report  to  the  Facilities \nDivision  of CDCR  with  recommendations  necessary  to  remedy  the  identified  deficiencies. \nThe  first  quarterly  report  will  be  submitted  the  first  week  of January  2007. \nThe  superintendent  of each  facility  is  responsible  and  accountable  for the  sanitary  and \nphysical  condition  of every  occupied  building  and  outdoor  area  at  his  or  her  facility. \nA  copy  of each  quarterly  inspection  report,  and  any  other  written  finding  relating  to \nphysical  plant  condition,  will  be  kept  in  a  working  file  in  the  office  of the  Director  of \nPage  76\nJuvenile  Facilities.  The  Director  of Juvenile  Facilities  will  include  these  findings  in  a \nwritten  annual  performance  review. \nThe  senior  supervisor  on  each  shift  will  be  responsible  and  held  accountable  by  the \nfacility  superintendent  for  the  sanitary  and  physical  condition  of the  building  or  area \nhe  or  she  supervises.  Each  superintendent  will  adopt  such  means  as  he  or  she  thinks \nnecessary  to  monitor  the  condition  of every  occupied  building  and  outdoor  area  and \ntake  measures  to  see  that  findings  are  incorporated  in  the  personnel  file  and  written \nannual  performance  review  of the  responsible  supervisor. \nWhen  a  supervisor  or  superintendent  identifies  deficiencies  that  cannot  be  remedied \nwithout  outside  assistance,  he  or  she  will  document  that  finding  in  writing  and  make  a \nrequest  for  assistance  from  the  appropriate  party.  A  supervisor  or  superintendent  will \nnot  be  held  responsible  for  failure  to  remedy  a  deficiency  that  requires  outside \nassistance,  provided  that  the  appropriate  documentation  and  request  for  assistance \nhave  been  completed  in  a  timely  way. \nMaster  Planning \n1.  DJJ  will  prepare  a  Juvenile  Justice  Facilities  Master  Plan,  by  July  1,  2007. \n2.  DJJ  will  prepare  an  Operational  Master  Plan,  in  substantial  conformance  to  the  description \nprovided  above  by  July  1,  2008. \nDJJ  will  prepare  a  proposal  for  the  first  prototypical  facility  by  July  1,  2007. \nDJJ  will  assign  a  person  to  be  a  dedicated  project  coordinator  for  these  master plans  by \nSeptember  1,  2006. \nPage  77\n",

Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \nOVERVIEW \nIn accordance with the requirements of the consent decree Farrell v. Allen (No. RG 03079344) in \nthe Superior Court of California, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation \n(CDCR) submits this remedial plan for medical care.  In this plan, the CDCR details how it shall \nimplement a Health Care Services Delivery System that improves youth accessibility to health \ncare services and provides a standard system of care and accountability. \nThe CDCR recognizes that the transition from the current system of delivery of health services to \nan  improved  system  requires  a transition  period.  Therefore,  this  remedial plan  includes  a \ntransition plan, which is the first step of the remedial plan.  The remedial plan will identify target \ntransitional goals as well as long-term program goals.  It also  identifies individuals who will \nensure accomplishment of those goals.  The transition plan, which is an extension of this plan, \nincludes  items  (development  of policy/procedure,  staffing targets,  development  of an  audit \ninstrument) that are not yet developed.  As these items are developed they will be provided to \nplaintiff s  counsel  for  review  and  comment  and  the  Court  Experts  for  approval  before \nsubmission to  the Court.  If plaintiff is not  satisfied with defendant's responses to plaintiffs \nwritten comments, she may bring the matter to dispute resolution pursuant to paragraph 48 of the \nConsent Decree. \nIn this remedial plan, the CDCR proposes to supplant the existing health care services for youth \nwith a different health care operational structure. The guiding concepts of the revised health care \noperations are: \n1.  Create a centralized state medical leadership with the ability to establish health care policy, \nimplement and monitor health services at all facilities, and  supervise health services staff, \nwhich includes hiring, firing, and progressive disciplinary action if indicated. \n2.  Develop standardized policy and procedure that matches the needs of youth and conforms to \nan acceptable national standard of medical and nursing care. \n3.  Develop a system of auditing staff performance against the newly implemented policy and \nprocedure. \n4.  Establish  a  program  that  fosters  linkages  to  university-based  programs,  public  health \nagencies, and other youth facilities to which youth may be transferred or from which they \nmay be accepted. \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  4 \n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \nSYSTEM STATEMENT \nThe Health Care Services Delivery System's mission shall be to provide youth access to care, \nquality care, and continuity of care. \nCORE VALUES \nThe Health Care Services Delivery System's core values are: \nCommuuity Standards:  We intend to provide quality medical, dental and mental health care \nthat meets community standards. \nIntegrity: We demonstrate honesty and consistency in all aspects of our work; we insist that the \nHealth Care Services members evaluate each situation and accept individual responsibility for \ndoing what is correct. \nRespect: We demand a work environment where all people are treated with fairness and dignity; \nwe accept individual differences and support adherence to professional standards. \nTeamwork: We pursue cooperative partnerships with both internal and external units involved \nin youth's health care and operational facets of the CDCR in providing quality health care to \nyouth; we function as a team, recognizing the importance of open communication, collaboration; \nand individual role responsibility. \nInnovation: We encourage new ideas for doing the job better and encourage input on established \npractices;  we  encourage  Health  Care  Services  members  to  seek  opportunities  to  maximize \npersonal contributions; and we are willing to take prudent risks to improve existing processes \nand procedures. \nPHILOSOPHY \nCommensurate  with  its  mISSIon  and  core  values,  Health  Care  Services  acknowledges  its \nresponsibility to: \n•  Provide  each  youth  with  medical,  dental,  public  health,  and  mental  health  services \ndelivered in  a caring, compassionate way with  attention  to  and documentation of the \nindividual youth-patient's condition and special needs \n•  Observe youth rights \n•  Provide effective oral and/or written communication \n•  Provide quality, cost effective health care services \n•  Diminish risks by implementing appropriate preventive measures \n•  Provide a method to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of care \n•  Determine the presence or absence of opportunities to improve health care \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  5 \n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \n•  Develop a method to improve health care and correct identified problems \n•  Resolve  problems  that  are  identified  through  quality  management  activities  and \nmechanisms \n•  Identify patterns and trends in health care that warrant evaluation \n•  Identify important single clinical events that warrant evaluation \n•  Develop a method to  ensure that health care staff shall  be appropriately trained  and \nlicensed, and that health care staff receives ongoing training and continuing education \n•  Develop a method to ensure that policies and procedures shall be accurate and current, \nare reviewed at least annually, and revised when necessary \n•  Develop  a method  to  ensure  that  safety  and  security  shall be maintained  for  youth \npatients and health care staff \nIn addition, a fundamental philosophical goal of the CDCR will be to ensure appropriate access \nof youth to adequate health care services.  The basic components of health care services delivery \nshall  be  provided  utilizing  the  American  Medical  Association's  Guidelines Jor  Adolescent \nPreventive  Services,  the  U.S.  Preventive  Services  Task  Force  guidelines,  and  the  National \nCommission on Correctional Health Care's (NCCHC) Standards Jar Health Services in Juvenile \nDetention and Confinement (see Reference section). \nCOMPONENTS OF CARE \nComponents of care will include: \n1.

The programs are described  in  the \"Access to  Care\"  section of this \ndocument. \nThe  programs  shall  be  developed  and  implemented  utilizing  the  National  Commission  on \nCorrectional Health Care's Standards for Health Services in Juvenile Detention and Confinement \nFacilities manual, as well  as  the American Medical Association's Guidelines for  Adolescent \nPreventive Services. \nHealth Care Service staff shall review the benchmarks and shall incorporate the concepts into the \nHealth Care Services Delivery System. \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  60 \n\nCalifomia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \nSCHEDULE OF IMPLEMENTATION \nAs  detailed  previously  in  this  document  the  Transition  Team  was  tasked  with  the  final \ndevelopment of the remedial plan and the identification of tasks necessary to fully implement the \nplan.  To this end, the Team identified 22 specific tasks along with time frames for completion. \nSome of the tasks identified are \"free standing\", that is a single task to be accomplished is not \nnecessarily dependent on the outcome of a previous or subsequent task.  However, for the most \npart tasks are sequential in nature and full implementation is not possible out of sequence.  The \nfollowing  will  describe  the  tasks  of the  Team  grouped  in  logical  sequence  describing  the \nimplementation time frames. \nADMINISTRATIVE, CLINICAL AND NURSING LEADERSHIP \nThe DJJ will: \n•  Establish  an  organizational  structure  that  provides  the  DJ]  Medical  Director  with \nsupervisory responsibility over the medical operations including physicians and dentists; \n•  Ensures the Director of Nursing has the clinical authority and responsibility for nursing \npractice; \n•  Separate the clinical and administrative oversight of the medical program; \n•  Establish a statewide Administrator; and \n•  Create a table of organization for Health Care Services. \nTo address this area the Transition Team will develop an organizational structure for Health Care \nServices both at the Health Care Services and institutional level. \nST ANPARDIZED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY \nThis is the single most important component of the health care delivery system and is the driver \nfor the identification of required resources and the evaluation of outcomes.  The process for the \nidentification, development, and implementation of these policies is critical to the outcome of the \nplan.  The Transition team will  work closely with the Court  Experts to  develop policies and \nprocedures. \nInitially, the Team will identify and develop a set of essential policies that will fonn the basis of \nthe delivery of health care.  These and all  subsequent policies will be referenced to standards \ncontained in the Standards for Health Services in Juvenile Detention and Confinement Facilities, \nby the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, 2004 edition.  The policies will fonn \nthe guiding principles by which all health care services provided within the department will be \nprovided.  Policies will be developed by the Team and will be forwarded to all institutions for \nreview and comment.  Input from  the field will be reviewed and appropriate recommendations \nwill be incorporated to the final document.  These initial policies will be processed through the \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  61 \n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \ndepartment's  policy  reVlew  process  and  will  be  promulgated.  For  those  policies  that  are \nidentified  as  needing  immediate  implementation,  they  will  be  processed  as  a  \"Temporary \nDepartmental  Order\" (TDO)  until  the  internal  review  process is complete and  the policy is \nissued. \nThe initial essential policies will be submitted to the Court Experts for final review by March 13, \n2006.  The Court Experts will meet with Health Care leadership by the end of March, 2006 to \nfinalize these essential policies.  The final version of the policies will then be submitted to the \nDJJ Policy section for internal review and processing.  This will be completed by June 15,2006. \nPolicies will  then be forwarded  to  Labor Relations  for  notification  and  discussion  with  the \nvarious labor groups. \nAs the policies are developed and sent to the field for review, each institution will be directed to \ndraft implementation procedures, specific for their institution.  These implementation procedures \nwill be forwarded to Health Care Services for review and approval.  This review will ensure that \neach institution has a mechanism  to  ensure  appropriate implementation of the policy for  the \nintended outcome, and a quality review mechanism.  These local procedures will be reviewed, \nmodified as  necessary and  approved  for  implementation once the  statewide policy has been \npromulgated. \nAs the institution specific operating procedures are approved they will be directed to develop and \nimplement  training  of  appropriate  staff.  Documentation  of  completed  training  will  be \nmaintained at the institution with a copy forwarded to the Health Care Services.  New staff hires \nwill  be trained  on appropriate  operating procedures  and  will  be  documented  as  above.  All \ntraining of existing staff will be completed within 60 days of approval of each local operating \nprocedure.  This training shall be completed and the initial essential policies fully implemented \nby  November  1,  2006.  Training  of new  staff on  appropriatc  policies/procedures  will  be \ncompleted within 30 days of hire. \nSTAFFING, EQUIPMENT AND SPACE \nOne  of the  initial  tasks  of the  Transition  Team  was  to  conduct  site  V1SltS  at  each  of the \ninstitutions to form a \"baseline\" evaluation to be used in conjunction with the experts' report.  A \nsimple review tool  was developed by the Team and  included  a number of areas  for review, \nincluding but not limited to: \n•  An inventory of medical equipment; \n•  Current staffing lcvels and staff deployment; \n•  Space for medical procedures; \n•  Office space and equipment for health care staff; \n•  Current procedures for purchasing of medical supplies and equipment; \n•  Existence and utilization of medical contracts to include registry; and \n•  A review of current phannacy and pharnlacy practices \nFebruary 24. 2006  Health Care Services  62 \n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \nThe  Team  also  developed  a mechanism  for  the  tracking  and  reporting  of allocated  staff, \nvacancies, staff availability, and staff coverage. \nAs  part  of the  institution  review  of the policies  and  their  development  of local  operating \nprocedures,  each  institution  has been tasked  to  evaluate the  staffing,  equipment  and  space \nnecessary to implement each policy and report this information to the Team.  The Team has used \nthis analysis, coupled with the information contained in the experts' report along with the results \nof the site visits to make recommendations to the department for required resource to implement \nthe  policies.  These  recommendations  are  currently under  review.  To  the  extent  additional \nresources are needed, requests will be submitted through the aru1Uai budget process.  DJJ will \nprovide staff, equipment and space that are adequate to meet the requirements of this plan and \npolicies and procedures. \nQUALITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \nStated in simple terms,  Quality Management in a health care organization represents what is \ndone  and  how  well  it  is done.  The goal  is  to  accurately  understand  the  basis  for  current \nperformance so that better results can be achieved through focused improvement actions. \nAudits and performance measurements as part of a total Quality Management program are used \ninternally by health care organizations to support performance improvement, and externally to \ndemonstrate accountability to the public and other interested stakeholders.  These perfonnance \nmeasurements benefit the health care organization by providing statistically valid, data-driven \nmechanisms that generate a continuous stream of performance information, which enables the \nhealth care organization to understand how well their organization is doing over time, and have \ncontinuous access to objective data to support claims of quality.  The organization can verify the \neffectiveness  of corrective  actions;  identify areas  of excellence  within  the organization;  and \ncompare performance with that of peer organizations using the same measures. \nVarious approaches have been developed to  improve performance and patient outcomes. The \nJoint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) has identified a 10-\nstep model for quality assessment and improvement.  These are the basic steps to developing a \nQuality Management plan that will result in improved organizational performance.  The steps \nare: \n•  Assign responsibility \n•  Delineate the scope of care and service \n•  Identify important aspects of care and service \n•  Establish thresholds for evaluation \n•  Collect and organize data \n•  Initiate evaluation \n•  Take actions to improve care and service \n•  Assess effectiveness of the actions and ensure that improvement is maintained \n•  Communicate results to relevant individuals and groups \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  63 \n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \nAssign Responsibility \nThe health care  authority  (Health Care Services Medical  Director)  is  responsible  to  oversee \nperformance improvement while the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and other clinical managers \nwithin the facility are charged with setting priorities (consistent with the authority's goals and \nvision),  establishing responsibilities,  and  designing  approaches  for  assessing  and  improving \npatient care \nDelineate the Scope of Care and Services \nThe key functions (structural, process, and outcome), procedures, treatments and activities to be \nmonitored and evaluated are identified. \nIdentify Important Aspects of Care and Services \nInstitutions should  focus their efforts on those activities that will make a difference (improve \ncare  and  service)  and  on  key  functions,  procedures  and  treatments.  Priorities  should  be \nestablished on an institutional-wide basis. \nEstablish Threshold for Evaluation \nFor each indicator, an expected, achievable level of performance or a threshold should be set. A \nmore in-depth review should occur if the threshold is exceeded.  Institution patterns or trends in \nperformance  should  be  monitored  and  compared  with  other  institutions  or  against  national \nstandards.  Health Care Services should monitor institution perfomlance relative to  its goals, \nverifying the source and the appropriateness of selected indicators. \nCollect and Organize Data \nFor  each  indicator,  there  should  be  evidence  of ongoing  data  collection.  Data  should  be \naggregated to identify trends in care, services or outcome.  Health Care Services should ensure \nthat  physicians,  dentists,  mental  health  clinicians,  nurses  and  other staff receive  training in \nmethods of quality improvement. \nInitiate Evaluation \nAn evaluation should begin when an unexpected pattern or trend is noted or when performance \nfalls  below  the  established  goal.  Problems  identified  arc  referred  for  an  intensive  review, \nparticularly when the cause and scope of the problem or trend is unknown.  When unexplained or \nunacceptable variations in care are identified, peer review (i.e., more detailed examination of \nrecords  by qualified \"peer\" professionals) may be necessary.  In  addition,  other causes and \neffects, such as how the care is delivered, may also help explain variations in care.  All peer and \nprocess  review  findings  should  be  documented  and  summarized  to  help  determine  their \neffectiveness in identifying potential quality problems or situations. \nTake Actions to Improve Care and Services \nThis step can pose the greatest difficulty for institutions.  When there is a discrepancy between \nactual  practice and the institution's perfornlance expectations, there must be evidence that an \nimprovement plan has been implemented. \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  64 \n\nCalifomia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \nAssess the Effectiveness of the Actions and Ensure Improvement is Maintained \nCritical  to  the  improvement  of care  or  services  is  determining if the  action  taken  actually \nimproved the care or service and if that change is maintained.  If not, staff should determine \nwhether the: \n•  Nature and scope of the problem or trend were correctly identified \n•  Corrective actions were appropriate to the identified issue \n•  Corrective actions were reasonable and achievable \n•  Authority and responsibility for implementing corrective actions were clearly specified \nand understood \n•  Corrective actions or improvement plans were implemented \nCommunicate Results to Relevant Individuals and Groups \nData should be summarized concisely and reviewed in a timely manner by quality improvement \nteams, committees or councils, medical staff committees, senior management and the governing \nboard.  A schedule for the compilation and distribution of data should be identified.  Special \nattention  should  be  paid  to  identifying  mechanisms  for  monitoring  resolution  of identified \nproblems or situations and ongoing improvement of care and patient outcomes. \nThe Quality Management Process \nI.  A criterion or standard is determined. A standard is a predetermined guide for acceptable \npractice,  such  as  the  NCCHC  Standards,  policy  and  procedure  manuals  or  clinical \nguidelines such as the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, \nDetection, Evaluation and  Treatment of Hypertension,  etc..  Standards  relate to  three \ndimensions of quality care: \na.  Structure  standards  that relate  to  the  physical  environment,  organization,  and \nmanagement of an organization; \nb.  Process standards that relate to the delivery of care; and \nc.  Outcome standards that reflect the results of care. \n2.  Benchmarking is the process of comparing data with other reliable sources both internally \nand externally. \n3.  An indicator is a tool used to measure the performance of structure, process, and outcome \nstandards_ \n4.  Information is collected to determine if the standard has been met.  The measurement \ntools may include surveys, audits, and peer review. \n5.  A corrective action plan is developed, typically through a Quality Improvement Team \n(QIT) for those areas that are found to be outside of the indicated threshold.  This plan \nincludes specific  time sensitive actions to be completed, along with  a mechanism for \nmonitoring and review. \n6.  Assess the effectiveness of the actions taken to determine that change is maintained. \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  65 \n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \n7,  Communicate results and ensure continued compliance, \nThe development of the Quality Management System will begin with the establishment of the \nQuality Management System by Health Care Services.  The fuJI Quality Management System, \nincluding audit mechanisms based on health care policies along with the audits identified in this \ndocument and staff training, will be completed as the policies and local operating procedures are \npromulgated.  All institution staff will be trained and the system fully operational by a target date \nofJune 2007. \nIMPLEMENTATION TRACKING SYSTEM \nTo ensure that the implementation of aJl  aspects of the Remedial Plan is on track, a detailed \nGantt chart will  be developed and  maintained  by Health  Care Services.  This chart will be \nupdated on a continuous basis and be modified as necessary as additional areas of concern are \nidentified. \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  66 \n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \nSTANDARDS AND CRITERIA \nThe Remedial Plan calls for a number of specific changes in the medical, mental health, and \ndental care for the CDCR DJJ youth.  To measure DJJ compliance with the requirements of the \nRemedial plan, an audit instrument with clearly defined standards and criteria, and thresholds of \ncompliance will be developed by the Court Experts for their measurement of compliance.  The \naudit instrument will be completed by June 15, 2006.  The audit instrument will be comprised of \nindicators selected from: \n•  The Remedial Plan; \n•  Policies and procedures approved by Court Experts \n•  National  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care  (NCCHC)  Standards  for  Health \nServices in Juvenile Detention and Confinement Facilities, 2004 Edition; \n•  The  American  Medical  Association's  Guidelines  for  Adolescent Preventive  Services \n(GAPS); \n•  US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF); \n•  Guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of other disease such as those published by \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nRegarding those areas related to nursing and medical care practice, Court Experts will use the \nprofessional judgment to assess compliance. \nAUDIT INSTRUMENTS WITH THRESHOLDS OF COMPLIANCE \nThe audit instrument will be used by both the Court experts, the Health Care Services Quality \nManagement Team and by the local facility Quality Management Manager to evaluate progress \nconsistent with the Remedial plan.  The audit instrument will include indicators from  sources \ncited  above  and  those  from  the  Remedial  Plan  that  Court  experts judge  to  be  critical  to \nestablishing an adequate health care system.  Thresholds for achieving compliance may vary for \nselectcd indicators, however the facility must obtain an overall score of 85% or greater for the \ninstitution to achieve substantial compliance, as defined in paragraph 23 of the Consent Decree. \nThe results of the audits will be presented to the facility wide Quality Management Committee \nand  when  applicable  to  the  Subcommittees  (Pharmacy  and  Therapeutics,  Infection  Control, \nMental Health and Dental) for corrective action. \nThe facility Quality Management Team will develop Corrective Action Plans for each area that \ndid  not reach  the  target  threshold  level.  Development of corrective plans  will  involve  any \nfacility staff that the committee feels may be necessary to create a viable plan.  The plan will \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  67 \n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \ninclude an implementation section so that a review can assess how the corrective plan will be \napplied.  A repeat audit will be conducted of the area in the next quarter or in cases where the \nplan  may  take  longer  to  implement  6 months  later.  The  appropriate  Quality  Management \nCommittee will again analyze the results of the audit and if necessary another corrective plan \ndevised.  These reports of corrective action plans will be filed in a Quality Management file at \nthe facility and sent to Health Care Services for review and storage in a Quality Management \nfile.  The Health Care Services may provide additional expertise to local facilities as needed to \nenhance corrective action plans. \nFebruary 24, 2006  Health Care Services  68 \n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \nDivision of Juvenile Justice \nReferences: \n1.

Allen by the \nplaintiff, Margaret Farrell, a taxpayer in the State of California, and the defendant Walter Allen \nIII, Director of the California Youth Authority, now the Division of Juvenile Justice (“DJJ”) \nwithin the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (“CDCR”). The Consent \nDecree required the defendant to file remedial plans in all areas of deficiency identified by \nexperts for the Court by January 31, 2005. In January 2005, based on DJJ’s decision to reform \nCalifornia’s juvenile system to a rehabilitative model based on a therapeutic environment rather \nthan simply address the deficiencies identified by the expert reports, the parties stipulated to \nextend the dates for the filing of remedial plans. \n \nPursuant to the agreed upon time extension, DJJ filed its proposed Mental Health Remedial Plan \non December 1, 2005. Both parties agreed that the plan submitted by DJJ lacked details \nsufficient for implementation.  \n \nBy agreement of the parties, national experts William Arroyo, M.D., Kimberly Hoagwood, Ph.D, \nRichard Shaw, M.D., and Hans Steiner, M.D. were retained to review and revise the Mental \nHealth Remedial Plan in consultation with the parties and the mental health experts serving \nunder the Consent Decree. The experts also consulted with Gail Wasserman, Ph.D. and with the \nConsent Decree Sexual Behavior Treatment expert, Barbara Schwartz, Ph.D. Christopher Murray \norganized and coordinated revisions for the experts. The experts affirmed the planning reflected \nin DJJ’s initial version and refined and strengthened the Plan by revisions which are reflected in \nthis document  \n \nPLAN ORGANIZATION \nStarting with Section 3, each section of this Plan begins with a brief description of The Issue. \nThis is followed by a Discussion section wherein details concerning deficiencies and required \nchanges are presented. Each section concludes with an Action Plan. A plan for monitoring for \ncompliance, including Standards and Criteria and identification of Actions Necessary to Achieve \nCompliance, will be filed with the Court by December 15, 2006. \n \nRELATIONSHIP TO PREVIOUSLY FILED PLANS \nAs necessary, DJJ will work with the Farrell Consent Decree experts in the areas of medical \ncare, education, disability, sexual behavior treatment, and safety and welfare in order to reconcile \nthe previously filed plans with any conflicts in this Plan. In the interim, as inconsistencies \nbetween this Plan and any of those plans are identified, DJJ will notify plaintiff’s counsel, the \nSpecial Master and the appropriate Consent Decree expert(s) to convene a discussion to resolve \nthe discrepancy. If discrepancies are not resolved by agreement, either party may invoke the \ndispute resolution procedure under paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Consent Decree. \n \nRESOURCES NEEDED FOR PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \nReference throughout this Plan to numbers and types of staff reflect DJJ’s and its expert \nconsultants’ judgments at the time the Plan was filed as to the numbers and type of staff \nnecessary for successful implementation. References to positions are working titles rather than \n    Page 1 \n\n \nspecific job classifications. DJJ will adjust staffing levels and types of staff when such changes \nare necessary to achieve programmatic compliance. DJJ will not be found in non-compliance \nbased solely on the number or type of staff in a particular program or function where DJJ is in \nprogrammatic compliance. \n \nBefore it makes substantial reductions in the staffing set forth in this Plan, DJJ will provide at \nleast sixty days notice to plaintiff’s counsel and the Special Master. This notice will demonstrate \nthat the proposed reduction will not hamper DJJ’s progress towards programmatic compliance in \nany area covered by this Plan. Changes in types or classes of staff that result in reducing \nqualifications of significant numbers of staff are deemed a “reduction” in staff for purposes of \nthis paragraph. Any dispute between the parties over reductions, whether reductions are \nsubstantial, or whether reductions are likely to hamper DJJ’s progress towards programmatic \ncompliance, will be resolved pursuant to paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Consent Decree. \n \n    Page 2 \n\n \nSection 2 \nPROGRAM STATEMENT\n \n \nMISSION STATEMENT \nThe primary goal of the Division of Juvenile Justice is to enhance community safety by \nproviding a safe, secure, productive, and accountable system in which staff, local stakeholders, \nvictims, the community, youth and their families work toward returning youth to the community \nas responsible and productive citizens. The mission of DJJ is defined by law: \n \n“To protect society from the consequences of criminal activity and to that purpose \ncommunity restoration, victim restoration, and offender training and treatment shall \nbe substituted for retributive punishment and shall be directed toward the correction \nand rehabilitation of young persons who have committed public offenses.” \n-Welfare & Institutions Code Section 1700 \n \nEnhancing community safety refers to both immediate and long-term safety. The Division of \nJuvenile Justice (DJJ) will place youth in secure facilities that provide rehabilitation/treatment \naimed at reducing risk and increasing protective factors. Long-term safety will require ongoing \nefforts with local stakeholders to determine strategies to most efficiently and effectively protect \ncommunities and rehabilitate youth.  \n \nThe specific mission of Mental Health Services consists of providing comprehensive and \nintegrated forensic and Mental Health Services to juveniles served by DJJ. Mental Health \nServices include: screening, diagnosis, psychometric assessments, psychotherapeutic and \npharmacotherapeutic treatment, consultation services to direct care and other staff; as well as \nleadership of clinical programs operating within a continuum of care in a variety of settings. \nSelection and delivery of services will follow existing evidence based standards of mental health \ncare.  \n \nPHILOSOPHY OF CARE \nThe philosophy of mental health treatment is based on principles of developmental \npsychopathology. This model includes the following principles:  \n \n1.  The primary goal of mental health care in the juvenile population is to address issues that are \ninterfering with adaptive functioning and to help restore the youth to a normative path of \ndevelopment. \n2.  Psychopathology in youth must be considered in relationship to developmental issues. \nBehavior in adolescents must be interpreted in the context of the youth’s chronological and \ndevelopmental age with consideration for the youth’s level of social and emotional maturity.  \n3.  Psychopathology in youth must be considered in the context of the individual’s social, family \nand educational environment, both with respect to factors that promote maladaptive \nfunctioning, and with respect to factors that need to be a focus of mental health treatment.  \n4.  Models of treatment that are based on work with adult patients must be adapted to \nincorporate developmental issues that are relevant in the assessment and management of \nyouth with psychopathology. \n5.  Assessment and treatment of youth will take into account both strengths and weaknesses of \nthe individual.  \n    Page 3 \n\n \nTREATMENT PRINCIPLES \nPrinciples of mental health treatment in the juvenile population include the following: \n \n1.  Assessment and treatment of individuals will be multimodal and address individual, family, \neducational and environmental factors. \n2.  Treatment will be individualized wherever possible according to the specific needs of the \nindividual. \n3.  Families, when available, will be considered to play a key role in the rehabilitation of youth \nand prevention of recidivism and will wherever possible be incorporated in the youth’s \nmental health treatment. \n4.  There will be a continuum of mental health treatment that addresses the intensity of the \nindividual’s mental health needs while ensuring placement in the least restrictive treatment \nenvironment. \n5.  There will be a system of ongoing monitoring and assessment of treatment progress. \n6.  Wherever possible, treatment will be founded on evidence based practices. \n7.  Mental health treatment will be provided by mental health staff with training and expertise in \nmental and behavioral health, especially as it pertains to youth. \n \nFAMILY INVOLVEMENT \nTreatment outcomes for mentally ill youth are enhanced by successful involvement of parents, \nguardians, and/or other significant adults in the youth’s life. Opportunities to solicit and engage \nfamilies exist throughout the youth’s commitment to DJJ. This includes intake and assessment, \ntreatment, transition to the community, and parole. \n \nCONTINUUM OF CARE \nThe continuum of mental health services has two primary dimensions: time and intensity. The \ntemporal dimension refers to continuity of services from intake and assessment through \ntransition to the community and services while on parole. The intensity dimension refers to the \ndelivery of services at different levels of intensity as determined by level of staffing, capacity to \ncontrol behavior and target systems, and the amount of therapy time. Treatment levels, in \ndecreasing order of intensity, are: inpatient (including acute and intermediate care), residential, \nand outpatient. \n \nAs noted in the 2001 report to Governor Davis, The Assessment of the Mental Health System of \nthe California Youth Authority (Steiner, et. al. 2001), “While morbidity is high, we expect that \nextensive rather than intensive intervention will be the basic model to address most [mental \nhealth issues in DJJ]. Finally, we expect that most children will require multi-modal, carefully \ncoordinated intervention, targeting multiple deficient domains. The main principle governing \ntreatment will be that the [youth] be allowed to function in the least possible restrictive \nenvironment which is capable of ensuring safety and personal growth.” \n \nEVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT / EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE \nThe phrase “evidence based treatment” refers to interventions consistently supported by \nscientific evidence that demonstrate improved patient outcomes. “Evidence based practice” is a \ntreatment approach that provides practitioners with a publicly accountable decision making \nprocess based on scientific research. This treatment approach involves research-based, generally \nstructured and manualized practices that have been examined using randomized trials or other \ncontrolled designs measuring both the efficacy and effectiveness of the practice [Hoagwood, \n    Page 4 \n\n \n2006]. However, it is important to note that there are very few evidence based mental health \ntreatments that have been validated within the juvenile justice populations. There is a strong need \nfor evidence based practices that have been developed in the general population to be piloted and \nevaluated within the DJJ population as part of the longer term development of the mental health \nplan.  \n \nThis Remedial Plan provides a strategy for moving DJJ mental health services to an evidence \nbased treatment and evidence based practice approach. \n \nINTEGRATED TREATMENT \nAs described in the Safety and Welfare Plan, all youth in DJJ facilities will be involved in \ncognitive behavioral treatment interventions related to the behavior and criminogenic factors that \ncontributed to their commitment to DJJ. The principles of cognitive behavioral treatment \npermeate all components of the continuum of care. \n \nUnder this Remedial Plan, the mental health team possesses (or will possess following \nappropriate training) the expertise to help guide the development of interventions under the \nIntegrated Behavior Treatment Model, to develop curriculum and provide training, and to \nprovide coaching/consultative services to treatment team leaders and direct care staff involved in \nthe day-to-day provision of treatment services to youth in non-clinical settings.  \n \nDJJ recognizes that it is important for all staff - including administrators, living unit staff, \neducators, security staff, mental health providers, integrated behavioral treatment providers, and \nother program providers within DJJ - to collaborate in the development of the Integrated \nBehavior Treatment Model. \n \n    Page 5 \n\n \nSection 3 \nORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE \n \nTHE ISSUE \nMental Health Services requires a close relationship with Health Care Services. Its psychiatrists \nare clinically supervised by the Medical Director and it relies on nursing, pharmacy, records, and \nother Health Care Services personnel and support systems. It provides direct care to youth in \nresidential mental health programs and through outpatient mental health services. Mental health \nstaff also provide training, consultation, and coaching to direct care staff who are not in the \nMental Health Services chain of authority but who deliver treatment services under the \nIntegrated Behavior Treatment Model. \n \nThe relationship of Mental Health Services, Health Care Services, and Integrated Behavioral \nTreatment Services, as well as the role of mental health leaders in central office and at facilities, \nis described below.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nLike implementation of the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan, implementation of the Mental \nHealth Remedial Plan requires creating the capacity for change by creating strong central office \nleadership and employing dedicated staff to guide and facilitate transition to a reformed mental \nhealth system in DJJ facilities. \n \nStatewide Leadership \nAuthority \nThe authority for the establishment and operation of the California Department of Corrections \nand Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice, and the appointment of the Chief Deputy \nSecretary for Juvenile Justice is set forth in Division 2.5, Chapter 1, Section 1700 et. seq. of the \nWelfare and Institutions Code. The Chief Deputy Secretary for Juvenile Justice is authorized to \nmake and enforce all rules proper to the accomplishment of the functions of the Division of \nJuvenile Facilities, including those related to the medical, surgical, dental, and mental health \nneeds of lawfully committed youth.  \n \nProgram Services \nDJJ will have a Director of Programs who reports to the Chief Deputy Secretary, DJJ. The \nDirector of Programs has administrative responsibility for all program services in DJJ facilities, \nincluding, among others, Health Care Services, Mental Health Services, Integrated Behavioral \nTreatment Services, and Education Services.  \n \nThe Medical Director directs all health care services for youth in DJJ. He or she is director of \nHealth Care Services and reports to the Director of Programs. The duties and responsibilities of \nthe Medical Director are described in the Health Care Services Remedial Plan.1  \n \n                                                 \n1 A different reporting relationship was described in the previously filed Health Care Services Remedial Plan. DJJ \nwill convene a discussion between plaintiff’s counsel, the Special Master, the Consent Decree Health Care experts, \nand the Consent Decree mental health experts to resolve the discrepancy. If this issue cannot be resolved by \nagreement, either party may invoke the dispute resolution procedure under paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Consent \nDecree. \n    Page 6 \n\n \nThe Mental Health Services Director/Chief Psychiatrist has responsibility for all services \nprovided by mental health staff in DJJ facilities. This includes mental health staff providing \ndirect care in residential mental health programs and in mental health outpatient services. This \nalso includes supervision, either directly, or through the Chief Psychologists, of mental health \nstaff providing training, consultation, and coaching to non-mental health staff who provide direct \ncare under the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model. \n \nDJJ will also have a Director of Integrated Behavioral Treatment Services who reports to the \nDirector of Programs. This person has administrative responsibility for the development of all \ncore rehabilitation/treatment programs, including substance abuse/dependence treatment and sex \nbehavior treatment programs.2  \n \nBecause treatment on core rehabilitative/treatment units is based on the same principles and uses \nthe same treatment model as residential mental health programs there is great overlap between \nthe techniques and skills used by staff in core programs and staff in mental health programs. The \nmental health staff and the trainers in the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model will have the \nhighest level of expertise with the treatment model. Consequently, while administratively \nseparate, the relationship between Mental Health Services and Integrated Behavioral Treatment \nServices must be very close. \n \nTo promote this close relationship, the Director of Integrated Behavioral Treatment Services will \ncoordinate closely with the Mental Health Services Director and Mental Health Services staff to: \n(1) help develop the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model, (2) provide training and ongoing \nconsulting/coaching of non-mental health staff in use of the model, and (3) help maintain quality \ncontrol and fidelity to the treatment model.  \n \nDJJ will continue to assess and modify, as needed, an appropriate organizational structure in \nconjunction with all of the Consent Decree experts. \n \nIntegrated Behavioral Treatment Services Leadership \nThe Integrated Behavioral Treatment Service is based on a behavioral health concept in which all \nyouth are provided services to increase their emotional and behavioral control through \napplication of the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model (IBTM). The Director of Integrated \nBehavioral Treatment Services oversees program development and implementation and \noperation of all Integrated Behavioral Treatment Programs. This will be done in conjunction with \nthe Chief Psychiatrist and Chief Psychologists who will have primary responsibility for issues \ninvolving mental health programs, clinical content, and supervision of mental health staff.  \n \nMental Health Services Leadership \nThe Mental Health Services Director/Chief Psychiatrist will provide leadership and management \nof Mental Health Services, including supervision of mental health clinicians and clinical \noversight and direction of mental health services. He or she will be responsible for developing \n                                                 \n2 The role of the Director of Integrated Behavioral Treatment Services may be in conflict with some aspects of the \nSexual Behavior Treatment Program Remedial Plan. If conflicts are found to exist, DJJ will convene a discussion \nbetween plaintiff’s counsel, the Special Master, the Consent Decree Sexual Behavior Treatment expert, and the \nConsent Decree mental health experts to resolve any discrepancies. If the issue(s) cannot be resolved by agreement, \neither party may invoke the dispute resolution procedure under paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Consent Decree. \n \n    Page 7 \n\n \npolicies and procedures for the delivery of mental health services to ensure compliance with \nexisting federal and state laws and regulations, and community standards. The Mental Health \nServices Director/Chief Psychiatrist will ensure that: \n \n1.  Supervision, training, and development of mental health staff are provided. \n2.  The quality of mental health care is monitored and continually assessed. \n3.  Ethical and professional standards of practices are implemented. \n4.  A system to evaluate the productivity of mental health care staff is developed. \n \nIf DJJ chooses not to use a Chief Psychiatrist as the Director of Mental Health Services in the \nfuture, the Director will be a clinician. \n \nAccess to Care \nAccess to mental health care will be available to all youth in a timely way. Access will be \ndetermined by policy and clinical criteria. Access to care includes access to supportive services \nnecessary to provide that care including nursing, pharmacy, laboratory and other diagnostic and \nancillary services.  \n \nMental Health Policies and Procedures \nThe Mental Health Services Director/Chief Psychiatrist will provide leadership and oversight in \ndeveloping and implementing: \n \n1.  Standard juvenile-specific mental health policies and procedures, treatment guidelines, \nand clinical programs, ensuring each will be commensurate with applicable community \nstandards. \n2.  Standard policies and procedures regarding mechanisms for mental health delivery, \nincluding access to care, medication administration, initial screening, health records, and \nresponse to emergencies. \n3.  The mental health components of the Health Care Services Standards and Compliance \nProgram. \n4.  The mental health components of the Health Care Services Quality Management \nProgram, including peer review of mental health clinicians and routine monitoring of the \nprocess of care. \n \nIntegrated Behavioral Treatment Model \nThe principles of the DJJ Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model are described in the Safety and \nWelfare Remedial Plan. These principles apply to all treatment programs, including mental \nhealth, sex behavior treatment, substance abuse/dependence treatment, and behavior treatment. \nWithin this context, the intensity of services and treatment modality for each youth are governed \nby the principles of risk, needs, and responsivity.  \n \nThe Chief Psychiatrist is responsible for the mental health components of the Integrated \nBehavioral Treatment Model. This includes responsibility for defining policies and procedures, \nstandards, training requirements and curriculum, and quality assurance measures through a \ncollaborative process with the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Services staff. DJJ will ensure \nthat there is collaboration between education, custody, mental health, and other program services \nin development of the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model. \n \n    Page 8 \n\n \nResource Allocation and Tracking \nDJJ will ensure that resources authorized by the legislature through the annual budget process are \nallocated and tracked through separate and distinct allotments for Health Care Services and that \nMental Health Services is identified as a separate category. \n \nOnce budget allotments are made, only the Chief Deputy Secretary, DJJ can approve the transfer \nof spending authority or positions into or out of Health Care Services or Mental Health Services \nand obtain, as needed, authorization from CDCR administration and state governmental \nagencies. \n \nRecruitment, Hiring and Job Descriptions \nRecruitment and hiring to fill authorized mental health positions will be the responsibility of the \nMental Health Services Director or his/her designee in coordination with Human Resources. \n \nJob responsibilities for mental health personnel will be established by division policy and be \nconsistent with activities included in approved class specifications. Policy regarding clinical \nresponsibilities of clinical staff will be determined by the Chief Psychiatrist or his/her designee \nconsistent with approved class specifications.  \n \nOrganizational Structure \nDJJ will develop and maintain a central office table of organization consistent with the principles \noutlined above and in the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan. \n \nFacility Leadership \nAs set forth in the Safety and Welfare Plan, the superintendent is responsible for his or her \nfacility. The superintendent’s responsibility is to carry out division policy, ensure the safe and \norderly operation of the facility, and ensure programs and services are provided to youth. \nClinical mental health decisions will be made by the top level mental health clinician at the \nfacility or his/her designee. Facility budgets, personnel decisions/evaluations, and program \ncontent for mental health are managed as noted above under “Statewide Leadership” \n(subsections “Resource Allocation and Tracking” and “Recruitment, Hiring and Job \nDescriptions”). \n \nThe senior psychologist (or highest ranking mental health clinician) at each facility is a member \nof the superintendent's executive team and participates in regular briefings, facility committees, \nand other administrative meetings as appropriate. A protocol will be established to ensure that if \nstaff interfere with the clinical and/or professional judgment of mental health staff, those issues \nare addressed at these meetings. If consensus is not reached, the issues will be referred up the \nappropriate chains of authority for resolution. \n  \nPerformance Evaluations and Disciplinary Action \nPerformance evaluations of all mental health personnel will be conducted in accordance with \ndivision policy by the supervisor at the appropriate level within the mental health chain of \nauthority. The superintendent or his/her designee may, at the superintendent’s discretion, provide \ninput to persons completing performance evaluations of all mental health staff. If the \nsuperintendent believes that the top level administrators are not performing appropriately and/or \nin accordance with division policy, he or she will take the concern up the appropriate chain of \nauthority. \n    Page 9 \n\n \n \nThe senior psychologist (or highest ranking mental health clinician) at each facility, or his/her \ndesignee, may provide written input in evaluations of non-clinical staff working in the mental \nhealth units and/or staff providing direct services in core program treatment units under the \nIntegrated Behavioral Treatment Model. \n \nConsistent with state, departmental, and division policy and applicable laws, the facility \nsuperintendent may initiate disciplinary or corrective action, as applicable, against any state or \ncontract employee, except that disciplinary action with regard to clinical matters and professional \nethics will be the sole responsibility of the Chief Psychiatrist or designee(s). Notwithstanding \nreporting relationships within the mental health chain of authority, the facility superintendent \nretains the authority to control access of all personnel to the facility and will consult with the \nChief Psychiatrist or his/her designee whenever there is a question of permitting access to the \nfacility of any mental health staff. \n \nCore Program Treatment Units \nAs part of the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model discussed in the Safety and Welfare Plan, \ncore program treatment units and other non-mental health treatment programs will have the \ncapacity to provide group and individual treatment/teaching for emotional dysregulation, anger \ncontrol, aggressive behavior, social skills, communication skills, and substance use education. \nDirect care staff in these units receive clinical oversight (but not administrative supervision) \nfrom qualified mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, or social \nworkers, who provide training and coaching in cognitive behavioral treatment and interventions. \n \nWorking Conditions \nWorking conditions, including clinical responsibilities, hours, and primary place of employment, \nfor mental health staff (i.e. staff within the mental health chain of authority) will be determined \nby the Chief Psychiatrist and Chief Psychologists, except that: \n \n1.  Hours for mental health coverage will be set by the Senior Psychologist in accordance \nwith a coordinated Program Service Day schedule at each facility to ensure that all \nmandated and routine professional services are provided in a manner that minimizes \nintrusion of one discipline on another. \n2.  In units on temporary lockdown and during times of emergency, the Senior Psychologist \nwill work with custody and medical staff to ensure that routine Mental and Integrated \nBehavioral Health services – such as the dispensing of medication and counseling – are \nprovided on the unit or other location specified by the superintendent. \n \nOrganizational Structure \nDJJ will develop and maintain a table of organization for each facility consistent with the \nprinciples outlined above and in the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan. \n \nTreatment Team Leadership \nThe treatment team leader roles and responsibilities will be defined in the development of the \nIntegrated Behavioral Treatment Model. Regardless of the position/job classification designated \nfor this role in mental health treatment units, the functional leadership, i.e., leadership based on \nthe specific skill set needed to guide the team on a specific issue, will be given to the appropriate \nteam member. For example, if the problem being discussed is primarily a diagnostic issue, the \n    Page 10 \n\n \nfunctional leadership role will be taken by the mental health clinician; or, if the problem being \ndiscussed involves the structuring of the youth’s day, the functional leadership will be taken by \nthe unit supervisor. The use of designated and functional leaders in the team concept will allow \nthe individual with the greatest skill to lead the team when necessary. \n \nMental Health Program Treatment Team \nMental Health Program living units will operate under the unit team concept.  \n \nThe unit supervisor is responsible for supervision of one mental health program unit. This person \nprovides oversight of the daily operations of the living unit, including staff supervision, \nscheduling, discipline, grievances, and reports. This person is the primary liaison between the \nliving units and upper-level facility management.  \n \nThe Clinical Psychologist provides mental health services for youth in the mental health program \nunit. The psychologist also provides training, coaching and consultation in cognitive behavioral \ntreatment and interventions to direct care and other staff in these units. Additionally, \npsychologists in the mental health programs will provide direct services to youth, including \nindividual and group therapy. Clinical Psychologists are part of Mental Health Services and \nreport to the facility’s Senior Psychologist. \n \nThe team psychiatrist will provide direct clinical services to youth, including individual therapy, \ngroup therapy, and evaluation, and provide input to Individual Change and Accountability Plans. \nThe psychiatrist will have allocated time to participate in the team meetings and provide input on \ndiagnosis and psychopharmacologic treatment options. Psychiatrists will provide education to \nteam members on psychiatric practice parameters and provide input on measures used to \nmeasure the effectiveness of the symptoms treated.  \n \nThe case manager is responsible for facilitating monthly case conferences of the multi-\ndisciplinary team, conducting the majority of the risk/needs assessment, developing an \nIndividual Change and Accountability Plan (ICAP) tailored to the risk and needs of each youth, \ncoordinating and prioritizing interventions, documenting progress in the ICAP, communicating \nwith parents, guardians, parole officers, and others, and providing weekly individual and/or \ngroup counseling.  \n \nThe Senior Youth Correctional Counselor is responsible for the living unit schedule and \nsupervising the Youth Correctional Counselors on the unit. The Senior Youth Correctional \nCounselor is accountable for the cleanliness, security, and order of the living unit. \n \nYouth Correctional Counselors provide direct supervision, behavior management, skills training \nand maintain a normative culture on the unit. As part of the normative culture model, YCC’s \nfacilitate group meetings daily. YCC staffing will be sufficient to ensure that small groups or \nactivities can be run simultaneously during the day or evening, as needed.  \n \nNursing staff are critical members of the mental health team and provide mental health and \nmedical support on the units, consistent with their classification and licensure. This may include \nmedication administration, health and mental health education, maintaining the normative \nculture, and implementing the Integrated Behavior Treatment Model. \n \n    Page 11 \n\n \nLicensed Psychiatric Technicians are responsible to support psychiatric nursing functions under \nthe direction of the team psychiatrist that are consistent with their license and classification. \nThey may provide group and individual counseling and education of youth in the areas of mental \nhealth signs and symptoms and utilizations of aspects of the integrated behavioral treatment \nmodel. \n \nTreatment Team Organization \nTreatment teams are organized around the concept that the treatment team is responsible \nfor addressing the behaviors and needs of the youth assigned to the team. Each team \nmember is responsible for the progress and achievement of the youth. Teams will be \nmulti-disciplinary and include input from living unit staff, treatment/rehabilitation \nservice providers, education, medical, mental health, parole, family, and youth as \nappropriate and possible. Treatment teams make decisions and recommendations \nregarding individuals, but facility/central office teams make decisions that impact more \nthan one youth or unit (e.g. priority for placement, jobs). Facility-wide services support \nteam decision-making regarding each youth’s behavior and monitor the effectiveness of \nthe approaches used by the team in guiding the youth's development and conduct. Each \nteam member has: \n \n1.  Technical or functional expertise and skill in implementing the DJJ Integrated \nBehavioral Treatment Model. \n2.  Problem solving and decision-making skills. \n3.  Good interpersonal skills. \n \nEach team member requires all three skills for the team to be effective, but different \nmembers have different technical or functional skills, as appropriate. \n \nTreatment teams are focused on goals tied to the division’s mission; outcomes are to be \ndefined by the program model.  \n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  DJJ will produce an organizational chart for central office consistent with the principles \noutlined in this section by September 1, 2006. \n \n2.  DJJ will produce an organizational chart for each DJJ facility consistent with the principles \noutlined in this section by October 1, 2006. \n \n3.  DJJ will institute a protocol at each facility, and for the Division, for resolution of disputes \nrelated to the exercise of clinical and professional judgment by mental health personnel. This \nprotocol will be in place by July 1, 2007 \n \n \n \n    Page 12 \n\n \nSection 4 \nSCREENING AND ASSESSMENT \n \nTHE ISSUE \nIn order to provide appropriate individualized treatment, case plans must be based on high \nquality assessment of risks and needs. In order to provide high quality assessments in an efficient \nmanner, reliable screening tools are needed to identify those youth who need additional testing \nand/or clinical evaluation.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nGoals of the Assessment Process \nMental health assessment will be comprehensive and consist of instruments which address areas \nof strengths and limitations including major mental health diagnoses, adaptive functioning, \npersonality, coping style, and family functioning. To the maximum extent possible, instruments \nwill be standardized, have established validity in the juvenile and young adult population, take \ninto account ethnicity, gender, and age effects, and be available in both hard copy and electronic \nformat. As needed, DJJ will use interpreters or have the instruments translated into other \nlanguages. At minimum, instruments will be available in Spanish and English. Methods of \nassessment will be complementary and lead to: \n \n1.  A profile of symptoms and functioning that require immediate attention (e.g. \nhomicidality; suicidality and/or self harming behaviors; potential for aggression and \nviolence; psychosis; developmental delays; problems with self care).  \n2.  Assessment of youth with regard to the mental health elements of the acceptance criteria \ndeveloped in accordance with the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan. \n3.  Comprehensive assessment of psychopathology (including psychiatric diagnoses, \npersonality and traits relevant to criminological outcomes) and diagnosis-specific target \nsymptom domains (e.g. depression, anxiety, impulsivity), cognitive and academic \nfunctioning, family history and functioning, capacity for collaboration and development \nof the treatment alliance. \n4.  A comprehensive and individualized case formulation which then drives a specific \ntreatment plan. \n5.  The capacity for follow-up assessments at appropriate and specific time intervals to \npermit assessment of progress, persistence of problems, reasons for lack of progress, and \nre-calibration of specific interventions targeting the causal loops that precipitate or \nperpetuate maladaptive functioning.  \n  \nTo the maximum extent possible, mental health assessment will be integrated with, or \ncomplementary to, other DJJ assessment processes, such as assessment of criminogenic factors \nand custody classification based on institutional risk and risk to reoffend. \n \nScreening Instruments and Process \nAll youth will be screened at a DJJ Reception Center prior to assignment to treatment programs. \nThe Reception Centers will be staffed by representatives from among the following clinical \ndisciplines: nursing, medicine, dentistry, social work, psychology, and psychiatry. As part of the \nDJJ’s remedial efforts, youth identified as requiring mental health services will have their needs \nmet in a timely manner. All youth receive medical, dental and mental health screening within \n    Page 13 \n\n \ntwenty-four hours of intake. This initial screening will also include a standardized screening for \nsuicidality and psychosis. If the mental health screening raises concerns requiring further \nattention (such as a history of suicidal or parasuicidal behaviors, self-harming behavior, or \nhistory of psychiatric hospitalizations) then a mental status examination will be completed by a \nmental health clinician by the next business day. There will be an on call system that provides \n24-hour access to psychiatric consultation for any emergent mental health care concern. Subject \nto same day review and approval by the on-call physician, all individuals who are prescribed \npsychotropic medications will continue using their medication and be seen by a psychiatrist no \nlater than the next business day. \n \nIn all cases, it is essential to obtain and review previous medical records, psychiatric records, and \nprior psychological test results. Where clinically appropriate, and subject to laws and regulations \ngoverning who may have access to such information, school records and details of Individualized \nEducational Plans (IEPs) will also be obtained from the DJJ Educational Services unit and \nreviewed.3 Health, mental health, and other records documenting prior treatments will be \nactively pursued with appropriate consent. Agreements with county agencies (especially \nprobation departments) will be developed in order to acquire copies of treatment records in a \ntimely fashion, either before or soon after arrival of youth at DJJ facilities. Specifically, to the \nextent necessary, the DJJ will require county agencies to include signed consent forms to allow \nDJJ staff to review relevant medical records. \n \nFamily and guardians are an essential part of the intake and assessment process. The assigned \ncase manager will make contact with a parent or guardian contact either by telephone or in \nperson within two business days of intake. Family members and guardians can provide historical \ninformation essential to completing an accurate and complete psychosocial history, developing \ntreatment plans, identifying youth strengths, providing mental health information including \nmedication history, etc.  \n \nThroughout the youth’s treatment, treatment team staff will maintain contact with family and \nguardians for issues related to consent for medical treatment, maintenance of family contact, \ndiscussion of treatment goals, updates regarding the youth’s treatment, and transition planning. \nHowever, pursuant to California Family Code, Sections 6924(d), mental health treatment or \ncounseling shall not involve the minor’s parent or guardian if, in the opinion of the mental health \nclinician, the involvement would be inappropriate (deemed to be potentially harmful to the \nyouth). Additionally, youth age 18 and over may prohibit staff from contacting parents and \nguardians. Additional details for involvement of families are discussed in Section 6, “Evidence \nBased Treatment and Family Involvement.” \n \nDefinition of the Mental Health Population \nPsychiatric Morbidity and Comorbidity in Incarcerated Youth \nSeveral significant studies have indicated that the frequency of mental health disorders is \nsignificantly higher for delinquents than for comparable non-delinquent adolescents (Abram et \nal. 2004; Teplin et al. 2002; 2005). For example, Cocozza (1992) estimated that every year, \n                                                 \n3 If any provisions in this Plan conflict with provisions in the previously filed Education Remedial Plan, DJJ will \nconvene a discussion between plaintiff’s counsel, the Special Master, the Consent Decree Education expert(s), and \nthe Consent Decree mental health experts to resolve the discrepancy. If the issue(s) cannot be resolved by \nagreement, either party may invoke the dispute resolution procedure under paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Consent \nDecree. \n    Page 14 \n\n \n150,000 juveniles who come into contact with the juvenile justice system meet the diagnostic \ncriteria for at least one mental disorder. Previous studies have, on average, found high rates \n(around 60 percent) of morbidity including both internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and \ndepression, as well as externalizing disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \n(ADHD), and high rates of comorbidity4 (around 66 percent). Significant variations in the \nfrequencies of psychiatric disorders have also been reported. For example, Friedman and Kutash \n(1986) uncovered a 10 percent rate of conduct disorder compared to a 100 percent rate \nuncovered by Timmons et al. (1997). Studies of comorbidity have suggested that the mean \nnumber of psychiatric diagnoses ranges from 2.7 to 3.1 disorders. Comorbidity may be a \nparticular problem in incarcerated girls with one study suggesting that over 90 percent of this \ngroup have more than one psychiatric disorder and nearly 80 percent have at least three \ndisorders. Clearly, this population is psychiatrically highly compromised, requiring \ncomprehensive clinical involvement and attention. Table 4.1 summarizes the major findings \nregarding the prevalence of mental health diagnoses in juvenile justice populations. \n \nTable 4.1 Mental health diagnoses in juvenile justice populations5 \n \nDisorder  Prevalence \nDepression  2-13 % (Males); 14-36% (Females) \nSuicide  10%; 34% (lifetime rate) \n20-21% (Males) \nAnxiety Disorder \n31-59% (Females) \nPosttraumatic Stress  16-32% \nDisorder  Females > Males \nBipolar Disorder  1.5-3% (some studies report rate of 20%) \nBorderline Personality \n17.6% \nDisorder \nPresent in the majority of incarcerated youth with exception of those \nConduct Disorder \nincarcerated for single major offense or drug related offenses. \nADHD  1-18% (Males); 6-34% (Females) \n33-50% \nSubstance \n25% abuse > one substance \nabuse/dependence \nUse of alcohol (100%), marijuana (70%), cocaine (25%) \n1-2% for schizophrenia \nPsychosis  25-75% for psychotic symptoms (atypical psychosis, personality \ndisorders, PTSD) \nAutistic Spectrum  15% of individuals referred for forensic psychiatric investigation had \nDisorder  pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) \n \n                                                 \n4 Comorbidity is the presence of more than one psychiatric disorder occurring in the same individual. \n5 Vermeiren R, Jespers I, Moffitt T: Mental Health Problems in Juvenile Justice Populations. Child and Adolescent \nPsychiatric Clinics of North America 15, 2 , 2006, 333-351, 2006  \n    Page 15 \n\n \nBackground Data from DJJ Population Studies \nIn the first results of the screening study carried out in DJJ facilities using standardized measures \nof psychopathology,6 Steiner et al. (2002) found that 20 percent of boys and girls were in the \nclinical range on internalizing disorders, and 19 percent of boys and 30 percent of girls were in \nthe clinical range on externalizing disorders (N = approximately 3,638; mean age = 16 years; 92 \npercent male; data collected 1997-1998). \n \nPsychiatric disorders are commonly classified using a five axis diagnostic classification system \nreferred to as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text \nRevision (DSM-IV-TR).7 Using this classification system, major psychiatric disorders, such as \nmood disorders or posttraumatic stress disorder, are listed on the first axis, referred to as Axis I. \nThere are a number of standardized psychiatric diagnostic interviews that are used to help \nidentify the presence of a psychiatric disorder according to these diagnostic criteria. For \nexample, Steiner et al. (2001) carried out a survey of the mental health diagnoses of the DJJ \npopulation using a variety of instruments.. The sample of youth surveyed between 1998 and \n2000 was matched with the total population at the time of the survey as indicated in Table 4.2. \n \nTable 4.2 Comparison of Psychopathology in Previous Studies of Incarcerated Juveniles. \n \nGeorgia  South Carolina  DJJ \nCriteria  General Population \nDISC-2  DISC-PC 2.3  N=790 \nMean Comorbidity    2.4 (2.7)  4 (2.1)  0 \nMood (Mania/Bipolar \n19%  24%  12%  .5-6% \n& Depression) \nAnxiety  30%  33%  31%  8.7% AACAP \nPsychosis    45%  4%  1% \n4.9% for alcohol \nSubstance Use  dependence \n30%  20%  85% \nDisorders  1.9% for illicit drug \ndependence \nDisruptive Behavior  35%  43%  95%  4-20% \nODD  13%    27%  2-16% DSM \nADHD  7%    10%  3-5% DSM \nConduct Disorder  29%    93%  2-9% under age 18, DSM \n(DISC = Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) \n \nPreliminary Treatment Needs Assessment \nWithin 48 hours of intake, each youth will be administered an initial mental health screening \nbattery (Treatment Needs Assessment) to identify emergent mental health issues, as well as other \ntreatment needs. Results will be reviewed by a psychologist no later than the next business day \n                                                 \n6 Youth Self Report, Achenbach, 1991 \n7 American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text \nRevision. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000).  \n    Page 16 \n\n \nfollowing completion of the instruments. These screening instruments will provide a clinical \nplatform from which to begin a more intensive evaluation. The screening instruments utilized \nwill assess if there are special mental health/psychiatric needs, social-emotional adjustment \nproblems, suicidal ideation/self-harm potential, and cognitive deficits. If the screening \ninstruments indicate significant mental health problems, clinical evaluation will be completed by \na mental health professional to further assess mental health treatment needs.  \n \nTo this end, DJJ will test the following standardized, validated instruments, as recommended by \nthe experts: \n \n1.  The Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Version 2 (MAYSI-2). The MAYSI-2 \nwill be administered on day 1. (Reference: Grisso T, Barnum R: Massachusetts Youth \nScreening Instrument – Version 2: User’s Manual and Technical report. Sarasota, FL, \nProfessional Resource Press, 2003) \n2.  A screening for suicidality using instruments such as the Suicide Ideation Questionnaires \nfor youth and adults (SIQ-JR, SIQ and ASIQ),8 or Suicide Risk Screening Questionnaire \n(SRSQ) developed by DJJ. Suicide risk screening to be administered on day 1. \n3.  The Voice Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (V-DISC) to make a preliminary \ndiagnostic assessment for the presence of major DSM-IV-TR Axis I psychiatric \ndisorders. While only validated for youth up to the age of 18, use of the V-DISC by Gail \nWasserman (one of the experts consulted for this remedial plan) and her colleagues has \nalso yielded good results with older youth as well. Based upon advice of the expert panel, \nDJJ will use the V-DISC on all youth upon admission to the reception center pending its \nvalidation on older youth or replacement by a screening instrument validated for youth \nover 18. This screening instrument will provide information on diagnosis and emergent \nrisk issues and can also provide data for trend analysis, population review, bed utilization, \netc. The V-DISC will be administered between days 2 and 4. (Reference: Wasserman \nGA, McReynolds LS, Lucas C, Fisher PW, Santos L. The Voice DISC-IV with \nincarcerated male youth: prevalence of disorder. Journal of the American Academy of \nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry, 41:314-321, 2002) \n4.  DJJ will use or develop a structured clinical assessment to assess the presence or absence \nof psychotic disorders. \n \nAt its discretion, DJJ may use and test other instruments that are not among those recommended \nby the experts. If it chooses to do so, care will be exercised to avoid redundancy and testing \nfatigue by youth during intake. \n \nThe performance of these instruments will be critically examined for their efficacy, especially in \nyouth aged 18 years or older. New data emerging from the scientific literature or data obtained \nfrom DJJ statistics may lead to the use of other more age appropriate instruments and the \ndiscontinuation of measures not found to be valid or useful within the DJJ population. \nModifications will be made in consultation with Consent Decree mental health experts. \n \nIndicators of mental health diagnoses or issues identified by the screening/assessment process \nmay result in a referral for further assessment, including referral for a face-to-face individual \n                                                 \n8 The SIQ-JR is for youth in grades 7-9; the SIQ is for youth in grades 10-12; the ASIQ is for adults.

Results of the \nassessment/evaluation may be used to determine the need for placement in a mental health unit \nand will assist in the development of treatment plans and provide the basis for further, more \ndetailed, assessments.  \n \nWhen youth are identified as requiring mental health services or programs not available at a \nReception Center and Clinic, the case will receive expedited processing that will be completed \nwithin fifteen working days. The Senior Psychologist at the Reception Center and Clinic will \narrange for services to be provided in the interim prior to assignment to a treatment program.  \n \nReferrals and Clinical Evaluation \nThe Initial Case Review (ICR) is conducted on all youth prior to leaving the reception center and \nclinics. Further assessment instruments that may be used either in the Reception Center or after \nassignment to treatment program include the following: \n \n1.  The Weinberger Adjustment Inventory (WAI) to assess coping and personality styles. \n2.  A Brief Family Strengths Assessment. \n3.  Intelligence testing. \n4.  A Risk/Needs Assessment to assess items such as the youth’s risk for reoffending and \nrisk and protective factors linked to criminal behavior. One example of such an \ninstrument is the Washington State Juvenile Court Assessment (WSJCA) that assesses \nthe following domains: Criminal History, School, Use of Free Time, Employment, \nRelationships, Family, Alcohol and Drugs, Mental Health, Attitudes/Behavior, and Skills. \n5.  A structured assessment of risk for violence. One example of such an instrument is the \nStructured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY) that assesses the following \ndomains: Historical Risk Factors, Social/Contextual Risk Factors, Individual Risk \nFactors, Protective Factors. \n6.  For individuals incarcerated for sex offenses, a structured assessment of risk factors for \nsexual offending. \n \nAll clinical screenings and evaluations will be placed in the Unified Health Record and will be \nconsidered confidential in nature. The information contained in the screening and evaluation \nreports may be presented by a mental health clinician during the Initial Case Review and may be \nused in the development of the Individual Change and Accountability Plan (ICAP). DJJ will \ndevelop policies and implement a system to provide hierarchical access to information. The \npolicies and system will protect confidential information while ensuring ease of access to those \nwith appropriate authorization. \n \nThe ICAP information is documented in the youth’s field and unit file and in the Ward \nInformation Network (WIN) by the assigned case manager. The ICAP is available to all \nmembers of the youth’s Interdisciplinary Treatment Team for review and implementation. \n \nCase Planning and Monitoring \nOngoing and systematic monitoring of youth progress will be essential for ensuring that \ntreatment/rehabilitation needs are being met; that the proper intensity of service is being \nprovided; and that the overall goals of the mental health and integrated behavioral treatment \nprogram for DJJ are being met. Systematic and unbiased feedback on client progress is essential \nfor quality improvement. A system to provide ongoing (at least monthly) assessment of treatment \n    Page 18 \n\n \nprogress is required. The goal is to provide direct care providers with a system that supports and \nenhances their decision making about their clients’ progress.  \n \nThe system will include at a minimum the following elements:  \n \n1.  Assessment of youth symptoms and functional characteristics at baseline and six month \nfollow-up intervals, as well as concurrently (at least monthly) while the youth is actively \nreceiving treatment. \n2.  Focus on both treatment strategies and treatment outcomes. \n3.  Minimization of respondent burden and avoidance of duplication. \n \nConsent for Treatment \nEvery effort will be made to obtain consent from parents or legal guardians for youth under age \n18 for mental health treatment within 24 hours of identification of need, including psychotropic \nmedications, pursuant to applicable law and community standards of care. \n \nMental health and other treatment will be protected under the guidelines of the state and federal \nstatutes that govern confidentiality and privilege of such information. In situations where parents \nor legal guardians are not available or refuse to give consent, appropriate consent through \napplicable legal procedures, including court order, will be obtained where necessary. In \nsituations where there is a need for emergency treatment to protect the safety of the minor, \ntreatment may be provided without consent in compliance with applicable laws. In such cases, \nclinical justification will be documented in the youth’s medical record. DJJ will follow all legal \nrequirements when prescribing psychotropic medication absent consent.  \n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  DJJ will develop tracking systems to document requests for, and receipt of, medical, \npsychiatric, and testing information from other facilities and agencies; successful and \nunsuccessful attempts to contact family members or guardians throughout a youth’s stay in \nDJJ facilities; the type of screenings and assessments conducted; and the time such \nscreenings and assessments were completed. These tracking systems will be in place no later \nthan November 1, 2007. \n \n2.  In consultation with local governmental entities, DJJ will establish a policy and process to \nreceive and share behavioral and assessment information about youth committed to DJJ by \nJune 1, 2007. \n \n3.  The policy and process described in the previous action plan item will be implemented no \nlater than December 1, 2007.  \n \n4.  Effective immediately, DJJ will use the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Version \n2 (MAYSI-2) at initial intake of all youth upon admission to the reception center. \n \n5.  Effective immediately, DJJ will use the DJJ Suicide Risk Screening Questionnaire for \nsuicidality at initial intake of all youth upon admission to the reception center.  \n \n    Page 19 \n\n \n6.  Effective July 1, 2007, DJJ will use the Voice Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children \n(V-DISC) on all youth upon admission to the reception center pending its validation on older \nyouth or replacement by a screening instrument validated for youth over 18. \n \n7.  By February 15, 2007, in consultation with the mental health experts, DJJ will use or develop \nand implement a structured clinical assessment to assess the presence or absence of psychotic \ndisorders of all youth upon admission to the reception center. \n \n8.  By November 1, 2008, and periodically thereafter, DJJ will analyze the efficacy of screening \nand assessment instruments for youth under 18 and those 18 and older. On an ongoing basis, \nusing these analyses and data from the scientific literature, DJJ will substitute improved \ninstruments and discontinue the use of those found less effective. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Page 20 \n\n \nSection 5 \nLEVELS OF CARE AND PROGRAMMING \n \nTHE ISSUE \nWhile there is a common treatment model that will be used across all settings in DJJ facilities, \nstaffing ratios, staff skills and training, and the intensity of treatment interventions will vary \nbased on the risk and needs of youth in DJJ facilities. Definition of mental health levels of care \nand of special rehabilitation/treatment programs is a key component of this Remedial Plan. \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe Integrated Behavior Treatment Model \nOver the next three years, DJJ will modify its mental health levels of care and programming as \ndescribed in this section. As the mental health system matures, program assessment will guide \nthe development of levels of care and programs. As accurate data on mental health needs \nbecomes available, future specialization and/or modification to levels of care and programming \nmay be appropriate. (See “Future Needs Assessment,” below.) \n \nMental health levels of care will be guided by the same principles as articulated in the Integrated \nBehavior Treatment Model (IBTM) described in the Safety and Welfare Plan. In the Integrated \nBehavior Treatment Model, it is assumed that all youth in DJJ facilities need mental health \nand/or behavioral rehabilitation/treatment services. The IBTM will also require that all DJJ \npersonnel – including those not trained or licensed as therapists – are therapeutic/rehabilitative in \ntheir interactions with youth and families. Consequently, while some youth in DJJ facilities will \nreceive intensive mental health services from mental health providers, all youth will receive \nrehabilitation/treatment services consisting of behavioral programming in therapeutic milieus \nbased on validated behavioral and mental health principles. Mental health professionals will \nprovide clinical oversight, coaching and mentoring to direct care staff providing these \nrehabilitation/treatment services.  \n \nAll direct care staff will be trained on the IBTM and able to work with youth on emotional \nregulation, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance, behavior analysis, and as the need \narises, aggression and self-harm behavior. Emergence of aggression and self-harm may lead to a \nmore intensive level of mental health and/or behavioral services. Mental health symptoms that \ninterfere with a youth’s ability to participate in, or benefit from, the core rehabilitation/treatment \nprogram will lead to formal mental health treatment at the appropriate level of care. \n \nThe treatment model used on core rehabilitative/treatment units will be the same model used on \nresidential mental health treatment units. Youth Correctional Counselors will use the same basic \npsychologically-based therapeutic/rehabilitative approach whether they are working on mental \nhealth treatment units or core rehabilitation/treatment living units. Staffing ratios, personnel with \nmore specialized skills, and the intensity of mental health treatment, differentiate mental health \nliving units from core treatment living units. \n \nUsing an IBTM throughout DJJ will provide a common language and approach for \nunderstanding and changing youth behavior. It will simplify staff training and ease staff \nmovement between units. System-wide adoption of an IBTM will facilitate continuity of care for \nyouth moving between programs and living units. \n    Page 21 \n\n \n \nMental Health Services \nThere will be three levels of care as shown in Table 5.1: Inpatient, Residential, and Outpatient.  \n \nTable 5.1 Initial Organization of Mental Health Levels of Care \n \n  PROGRAM \nWithin DJJ (Correctional Treatment Centers) and/or \nInpatient  contracted with community hospitals and/or \nE  Department of Mental Health (including ICF) \nR\nA Intensive Treatment Program (ITP) \nC\nF  Residential  Specialized Counseling Program (SCP) \nO\nIntensive Behavior Treatment Program (IBTP) \nL \nE Core Rehabilitation/Treatment Program \nV\nE Substance Abuse/Dependence Treatment Program \nL Outpatient \nSex Behavior Treatment Program  \nBehavior Treatment Program  \n \nOutpatient mental health services (see below) will be provided to any youth whose mental health \nneeds are not addressed in the program to which they are assigned. Although most outpatient \nservices will be provided to youth at the Core Rehabilitation/Treatment level of care as defined \nin Table 5.1, outpatient mental health services are available to youth at all levels of care and \nprogramming.  \n \nPlacement of youth within treatment programs will be based on institutional risk, individualized \ntreatment needs, age, and other factors required by law. \n \nTreatment Hierarchy \nDJJ will develop an Integrated Behavior Treatment Model based on the Washington State \nJuvenile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA) integrated model. The provision of services under \nthe Integrated Behavior Treatment Model will be predicated on a treatment hierarchy similar to \nthe JRA model, which has as its top priority the reduction and prevention of harm to self or \nothers. In order of priority, the elements of the JRA hierarchy are: \n \n1.  Suicide ideation, threats or behaviors / self-injurious behavior \n2.  Aggressive ideation, threats or behavior \n3.  Escape ideation, threats or behavior \n4.  Treatment-interfering behavior \n5.  Research based risk and protective factors relating to recidivism \n6.  Quality of life issues9  \n \n                                                 \n9 Quality of life issues include such things as being homeless, being unemployed or unable to maintain employment, \nbeing expelled from school, lacking friends or having inconsistent relationships, having excessive unstructured time, \nhaving anti-social peers, etc. Most of these elements are correlated with recidivism. \n    Page 22 \n\n \nDJJ may add other elements to their hierarchy - such as the presence of psychotic symptoms or \nsymptoms of acute intoxication. \n \nOutpatient Services \nThe outpatient mental health service is part of the integrated treatment delivery system at each \nfacility. Outpatient mental health personnel provide outpatient services in response to referrals \nfrom youth, their families or staff and to youth discharged from residential mental health \nprograms who require ongoing mental health services in a core rehabilitation/treatment setting. \nThese services may be provided in the living unit by unit staff or by a nurse or mental health \nprofessional. Outpatient services may also be provided in the facility clinic.  \n \nOutpatient mental health services consist primarily of consultation, medication management, \nscreenings, assessments, and crisis evaluations and referrals.  \n \nWhile other rehabilitative services are generally provided by non-mental health staff who are \nclinically supervised by mental health clinicians, mental health staff assigned to core \nrehabilitation/treatment living units may periodically assist in ongoing intensive needs resource \ngroups, and in individual, group, and family therapy. Service provision will be prioritized using \nthe treatment hierarchy described above.  \n \nStaffing Standards for Outpatient Mental Health Services \nStaffing for outpatient mental health services are: \n \n•  1.0 Psychiatrist per 200 youth \n•  1 Senior Psychologist per 7 Psychologists (minimum 1 per facility) \n•  1 Office Technician per 4 clinicians \n \nStaffing standards for core program rehabilitation/treatment units determine the number of \npsychologists providing outpatient services. (This varies from 1:24 in core Behavior Treatment \nPrograms to 1:76 in regular core rehabilitation/treatment programs. See Safety and Welfare \nRemedial Plan, Section 6: “Convert Facilities to Rehabilitative Model,” for details.) \n \nIntegrated Behavioral Treatment Services Consulting and Coaching \nConsistent with the Integrated Behavior Treatment Model, direct care staff in core \nrehabilitation/treatment living units will have the capacity – through training, coaching, and \nconsultation – to provide group, individual, and family treatment/teaching for emotional \ndysregulation, anger control, aggressive behavior, social skills, communication skills, and \nsubstance use education. Psychologists, or other mental health professionals, will provide clinical \noversight, consulting and coaching to direct care staff.  \n \nIn conjunction with other qualified trainers and IBTM staff, these consulting mental health \nclinicians (psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers) provide training, coaching and \nconsultation in cognitive behavioral treatment and interventions to direct care staff in non-mental \nhealth living units and program settings. For mental health clinicians assigned to core program \nrehabilitation/treatment living units, consultation will be their primary responsibility. Mental \nhealth clinicians in mental health units may spend more time providing direct services and less \ntime providing consultation.  \n \n    Page 23 \n\n \nForensic Services  \nIn order to avoid dual relationships, evaluations for forensic hearings that determine a youth’s \nrelease date (such as Welfare and Institutions Code § 1800 hearings and parole board date \nhearings) will not be performed by mental health professionals already providing treatment to a \nyouth. Instead, forensic evaluations will be provided either by mental health professionals who \nhave no other relationship with the youth (such as professionals from a different living unit) or a \ndedicated forensic mental health service. These evaluators will be able to review progress of the \nyouth through discussions with treating clinicians and accessing all relevant records pertaining to \nthe youth. These records, among other things, will specify progress towards treatment and \nrehabilitation goals.  \n \nWhen a disciplinary review hearing involves a mentally ill youth, a determination will be made \nby a mental health clinician whether the behavior under review results from the youth’s mental \nillness as defined by the policies referred to in the following paragraph. This determination will \nbe made either by a mental health professional who has no clinical relationship with the youth or \nby someone from a dedicated forensic mental health service.  \n \nDJJ will work with the Consent Decree experts to develop policies and procedures regarding the \ninvolvement of youth with mental illness in the disciplinary process. Among other things, these \npolicies will ensure that youth do not receive time adds for behavior resulting from a mental \nillness or its treatment. This policy will balance the need to involve clinical review in the \ndetermination of appropriate consequences while protecting the clinician's role with his/her \npatient. It is expected that acting out behavior resulting from a mental illness or its treatment will \nnot result in punishment, but rather an adjustment to the youth’s treatment plan. \n \nAs with other potential conflicts between remedial plans, if this provision is found to be in \nconflict with the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan, the conflict resolution procedure outlined in \nSection 1 will be used. \n \nForensic services as discussed here do not include treatment summaries or annual reviews which \nmay be completed by the assigned clinician. \n \nCore Rehabilitation/Treatment Programs \nLiving unit size, programs and staffing for the Core Rehabilitation/Treatment Program and the \n(non-mental health) Behavior Treatment Program is discussed in the Safety and Welfare \nRemedial Plan. \n \nAdmission and discharge criteria and program descriptions for the Sex Behavior Treatment \nProgram are discussed in the Sexual Behavior Treatment Program Remedial Plan. Living unit \nsize in sex behavior treatment programs will require reconciliation between the various remedial \nplans. This, in turn, will affect staffing patterns assumed in the Sexual Behavior Treatment \nProgram Remedial Plan. \n \nSubstance Abuse/Dependence Treatment Program \nIf the prevalence of substance dependence found in the DJJ population in 2001 is still reasonably \naccurate, there are likely between 800 and 900 males whose sole diagnosis is substance \n    Page 24 \n\n \ndependence. Another 600 to 650 males likely have a sole diagnosis of substance abuse.10 Fifteen \nto 20 females likely fall into each of these categories. Substance dependence, as opposed to \nsubstance abuse, generally requires long-term therapy along with relapse prevention. In addition, \nmany more youth have substance dependence, or substance abuse, co-occurring with one or \nmore mental health diagnosis. \n \nThe co-occurrence of substance use disorders with juvenile offenses is well documented (Stewart \n& Trupin, 2003; Teplin et al., 2002; Wasserman et al., 2002; Greenbaum et al., 1996). In many \ncases, substance use by youth is a primary contributor to juvenile delinquency (Duncan et al., \n1997; Loeber & Strouthammer-Loeber, 1998). In other cases, substance use disorders exacerbate \nthe intensity and frequency of other behavior problems (Moffit, 1993; Stewart et al., 1997). In all \ncases, substance abuse by youth and family members hampers rehabilitation and dramatically \nincreases the likelihood of persistent offending (Myers et al., 1998; Stewart et al., 2001; Trupin \n& Boesky, 2001). \n \nIn consultation with national experts, DJJ will develop a Substance Abuse/Dependence \nTreatment Program that conforms to the principles underlying the Integrated Behavior Treatment \nModel and the proposed treatment strategy and philosophy outlined below.  \n \n1.  Adopt a relapse prevention model that teaches youth skills to cope with high risk \nsubstance taking situations as well as situations placing youth at risk for illegal behavior \nand other risky behaviors (health, violence, victimization, etc). Excellent relapse \nprevention manuals based on cognitive behavioral and motivational principles exist and \nshould be utilized in all aspects of treatment. An example is The Kids Curriculum \ndeveloped by the Change Company. \n \n2.  Teach skills that can be practiced within all phases of DJJ placements such as: \n \na.  Interpersonal effectiveness and social skills. \nb.  Emotion regulation and anger management skills. \nc.  Refusal and avoidance skills. \nd.  Self advocacy or support seeking skills. \n \n3.  Develop detailed descriptions of problem behaviors youth experience in the community. \nAs youth are motivated to change they will provide increased factual details of places, \npeople and situations that place them at risk of substance use, illegal behavior and mental \nhealth decomposition. The Inventory of Drug Taking Situations (IDTS) is a useful \nassessment tool in identifying general categories of high risk situations. \n \n4.  Teach and rehearse skills that can be used in community high risk situations using role \nplays, groups and rehearsed interactions with family members. \n \n5.  Identify a network of community based social supports for preventing relapse that \nincludes natural supports (e.g. family, friends, neighbors, faith based community, ) and \nformal supports (e.g. parole officers, treatment providers, teachers). Assertively work to \ndevelop support for youth who identify no community supports. \n                                                 \n10 See Table 6.2 in Section 6, Evidence Based Treatment \n    Page 25 \n\n \n \n6.  Create comprehensive relapse prevention plans that are developed and written in \nconjunction with youth, treatment teams, and with appropriate consent and in compliance \nwith state and federal law, the primary members of the youth’s community support \nnetwork. Also with appropriate consent, and in compliance with state and federal law, \ndisseminate relapse prevention plans to community providers, family members, and \nnatural and formal supports prior to discharge.  \n \nUpon development of a substance dependence/abuse treatment program, placement will be based \non criteria established in conjunction with national experts and may include screening or \ndiagnostic tools, such as the pertinent sections of the Voice-Diagnostic Interview Schedule for \nChildren (V-DISC), the Personal Experiences Inventory (PEI), American Society of Addiction \nMedicine (ASAM) criteria, or history provided by other informants. Youth who do not need this \nlevel of substance abuse treatment, but who have a history of substance use or abuse, will receive \nappropriate substance abuse treatment in their core rehabilitation/treatment unit. \n \nDJJ will use evidence based substance abuse/dependence treatment programs, such as the \nNational Institute of Drug Abuse Cannabis Youth Treatment Program for youth in need of such \ntreatment. \n \nThe indented text below borrows heavily from the Washington State JRA Integrated Treatment \nModel Report, dated September 2002. Certain modifications have been made to make \ndescriptions consistent with terminology used by DJJ. \n \nDevelopmental levels of juveniles require modified interventions which differ from adult \nsubstance abuse/dependence treatment interventions. A heavy emphasis on motivating and \nengaging youth to invest in substance abuse/dependence treatment is necessary. The \ninclusion of identified motivation strategies as well as substance abuse-specific motivation \nstrategies (e.g., Motivational Interviewing, Motivation and Engagement Therapy) must be \nwell understood and employed by staff. \n \nThe focus of Substance Abuse/Dependence Treatment Programs will be primarily on skill \nacquisition through functional replacement of the effects of drug-taking behavior with skills \nchosen from the cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) skill set used in the Integrated \nBehavior Treatment Model. Because youth use drugs and alcohol for different reasons, DJJ \nSubstance Abuse/Dependence Treatment Programs will use behavioral analysis to identify \nthe vulnerabilities, risks, antecedents and functions of drug using behavior. Some youths will \nrequire several behavioral chain analyses, each representing a different instance of using. \nOnce the vulnerabilities, risks, antecedents and functions of the behavior have been \nidentified, various skills from the CBT skill modules will be taught and strengthened. Thus, \nyouth will learn the same skills to treat problem behavior in Substance Abuse/Dependence \nTreatment programming as other DJJ youth. As a result, staff will be able to coach and \nsupport youth in their treatment of substance abuse/dependence issues regardless of specific \nexpertise in the substance abuse/dependence treatment area. \n  \nSkill generalization interventions are also a focus in the Substance Abuse/Dependence \nTreatment Programs. Abstinence is the goal of substance abuse/dependence treatment, but \n    Page 26 \n\n \nfollowing a relapse, work immediately shifts to getting clean again and remaining in \ntreatment.  \n \nThus, understanding the function of drug use and associated risk factors through behavioral \nanalysis, developing skills for abstaining, or for reducing likelihood to use, and developing \nrelapse prevention plans are the key elements of treatment focused on skill development and \ngeneralization. \n \nEducation about traditional “twelve-step” programs will continue in residential programs and \nas a community support for skill generalization after youth leave DJJ facilities. Plans to cope \nwith cue exposure11 to drugs and alcohol, and engaging in prosocial activities that are not \ncompatible with substance use, will be addressed by residential staff, parole staff, youth and \nfamilies together as key treatment planning and transition factors for youth receiving \ntreatment in facilities. Involving families and care-givers in supporting treatment for their \nyouth will be important for youth returning to the community.  \n \nTreatment protocols and curricula will be open-ended so that entry into a program, or transfer \nfrom another program, is not dependent upon fixed start and stop times for treatment. \n \nYouth complete the Substance Abuse/Dependence Treatment Program after meeting criteria \nwhich will be developed in consultation with the Consent Decree mental health experts.  \n \nPresence or emergence of treatment interfering behavioral or mental health problems while in a \nsubstance abuse/dependence treatment program may lead to placement in more intensive \ntreatment programs, such as a Behavior Treatment Program, Residential Mental Health Program, \nor Intensive Behavior Treatment Program. \n  \nPending development of the Substance Abuse/Dependence Treatment Program under the IBTM, \nDJJ will continue its current specialized treatment programs and outpatient programs for youth in \nneed of such interventions. As living units are converted to the IBTM, youth in those living units \nwill be provided with skills, treatment, and therapeutic interventions which will assist those \nyouth to address substance abuse/dependence behavior. \n \nResidential Mental Health Programs \nDJJ will modify existing residential mental health programs by reducing unit size, increasing \nstaffing, and implementing an Integrated Behavior Treatment Model. DJJ will also open an \nadditional Intensive Behavioral Treatment Program. Initially, there will be three types of \nresidential mental health treatment programs: \n \n1.  A smaller, more richly staffed Intensive Treatment Program (ITP) \n2.  A smaller, more richly staffed Specialized Counseling Program (SCP) \n3.  A smaller, more richly staffed Intensive Behavioral Treatment Program (IBTP) \n \nEach facility with one or more residential mental health treatment programs will have a mental \nhealth program administrator. \n \n                                                 \n11 In this context, cue exposure refers to situations which trigger the desire for drugs or alcohol. \n    Page 27 \n\n \nBecause of the high presence of mental illness in the DJJ population, it may be desirable or \nnecessary in the future to add an intensive sex behavior treatment program and/or an intensive \nsubstance abuse/dependence treatment program for youth with co-occurring mental illness. \nImplementation of these other residential programs will be planned once better data are available \nto estimate actual levels of demand. If demand for one or both of these programs is small, other \noptions will be considered. \n \nLiving Unit Size for Residential Mental Health Programs \nApproximately one year ago, DJJ’s maximum population for ITP and SCP living units was 48. \nDuring this fiscal year, DJJ is reducing its maximum population for ITPs and SCPs to 30 and its \nmaximum population in its IBTP to 20 youth (in the program) plus 5 youth mentors. DJJ will \nalso increase staffing on ITPs and SCPs by 2 psychiatric technicians, 0.5 supervising case \nmanagers, and increase nursing coverage on ITPs from 5 days per week to 7 days per week. \nDJJ’s plan to increase staffing and to reduce the maximum size of ITPs and SCPs to 30 and \nIBTPs to 20 (plus 5 youth mentors) is based on its current youth census and physical capacity.  \n \nBy the end of fiscal year 2007-2008, DJJ will reduce living unit sizes to 24 on the ITPs and SCPs \nand to 16 (exclusive of mentors) on the IBTP. Based on the experts’ position that the size of \nthese living units must be further reduced, DJJ will work with the Consent Decree mental health \nand Safety and Welfare experts to determine the appropriate living unit sizes and staffing \npatterns for each type of mental health unit. DJJ will adjust living unit sizes accordingly by the \nend of FY 2009-2010. \n \nUnder the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan, as new facilities are constructed, the size of \nresidential mental health programs will be smaller than the new core rehabilitation/treatment \nliving units. This reflects the judgment of DJJ’s leadership, supported by all mental health \nexperts that they have consulted, that small living unit size is essential to the provision of \nintensive mental health services. The actual maximum size will be determined through the \nplanning process described in the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan. \n \nFactors Common to Residential Mental Health Programs \nReferral to a Residential Mental Health Program \nReferral to a residential mental health program will be made by the youth’s treatment team or \noutpatient mental health services personnel. The treatment team will include a mental health \nclinician.  \n \nUpon evaluation, if significant mental health issues are detected and the youth meets the criteria \nfor placement in a residential mental health program, he or she may be recommended for \ntransfer. Once referred, placement of a youth in a residential mental health program is not \nautomatic, but subject to the acceptance process described below. DJJ will modify referral \ncriteria in consultation with the Consent Decree mental health experts, incorporating assessment \nresults as appropriate. \n \nResidential Mental Health Program Acceptance Process \nA centralized mental health team reviews referrals to residential mental health programs and \nmakes a determination if the referral is consistent with entrance criteria and if the placement is \nappropriate. All beds and movement will be centrally coordinated. Placements will be consistent \nwith decisions made through this acceptance process.  \n    Page 28 \n\n \n \nDue to the high risk/high need status of youth referred to an IBTP, referrals will be expedited and \nplacement determination by the centralized mental health review team will be made within one \nbusiness day after receipt of the placement recommendation of the treatment team.  \n \nWaiting Lists for Residential Mental Health Programs \nThe number of spaces in each residential mental health program is limited in order to ensure that \nthere are sufficient staff to address the treatment needs of the youth in the program. If youth are \nreferred to mental health programs when all spaces are filled, they will be tracked on a waiting \nlist that is maintained by Mental Health Services headquarters staff. For any youth placed on a \nwaiting list for a mental health program, headquarters staff will review the youth’s record and \ndiscuss his/her condition and circumstances with the clinician from the treatment team that made \nthe referral. Headquarters staff will use uniform criteria to prioritize youth for placement off of \nthe waiting list as space in residential mental health programs become available. If a youth is \napproved for placement in an IBTP and a bed is not immediately available, the youth will be \nplaced in an alternative residential mental health program no later than the day following the \napproval of placement. If no beds are available, all youth on mental health waiting lists will be \nmanaged in the most clinically appropriate manner possible, such as through the provision of \nmore intensive outpatient mental health services in his or her core rehabilitation/treatment living \nunit. \n \nResidential Mental Health Program Team Organization \nResidential mental health programs will operate under the unit team concept using a \nmultidisciplinary approach developed as part of the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Services \nmodel. (See Section 3 – Organization Structure, Treatment Team Organization)  \n \nTreatment Plans for Youth in Residential Mental Health Programs \nYouth in residential mental health program living units will receive rehabilitation/treatment \nservices, including appropriate educational and vocational programming, in the least restrictive \nmanner possible. If, for any youth, safe delivery of the services cannot be accomplished through \nnormal procedures, an alternative schedule or procedure will be developed. Within three working \ndays of placement in a residential mental health program, a case conference will be held and the \ntreatment plan developed. At 30 days, and monthly thereafter, a staffing will evaluate the need \nfor continued stay in the program, refinement of the treatment plan, or recommendation for \nplacement in an alternative treatment program. Treatment team meetings will be held at least \nweekly in accordance with the program service day schedule (see below). \n \nReview Process for Extended Lengths of Stay \nIf a youth has been in an IBTP or SCP for four months or longer, or in an ITP for two months or \nlonger, treatment team reviews of his or her progress will include at least one clinician who is not \nregularly involved in the youth’s treatment. Ongoing participation by a clinician not involved in \nthe youth’s treatment will continue as recommended by the outside clinician. Copies of treatment \nteam reviews requiring the presence of an outside clinician will be sent to the appropriate central \noffice mental health staff.  \n \nExit Criteria and Process \nUpon admittance to a residential mental health program, the treatment team will establish \nspecific goals and behavioral expectations to be met prior to transfer to a lower level of care unit. \n    Page 29 \n\n \nThese goals and expectations will primarily focus on the management of the symptoms and \nbehaviors that resulted in referral to the program. A youth will be transferred to a less intensive \nlevel of care upon determination by the treatment team that the youth has met these goals and has \ndemonstrated significantly diminished symptomatology (including, in the case of the IBTP, \nsignificantly reduced aggressive behavior) and increased stable control of behaviors for the \nperiod of time established in the youth’s treatment plan. \n \nWhen the youth has met treatment goals and behavior expectations in a residential mental health \nprogram, a plan for transition back to an appropriate living unit will be developed. Transition \nactivities may include:  \n \n1.  Regular visits to the designated receiving living unit. \n2.  School attendance in the receiving treatment program school area. \n3.  Attendance in small group meetings within the designated receiving living unit. \n \nDaily Schedule \nResidential mental health programs provide safe, secure environments within which youth are \nengaged in constructive programmatic activities. In ITPs and IBTPs, this includes educational \nservices on, or in classrooms adjacent to, the living unit. Youth in SCPs attend school in the \nfacility’s education area. \n \nA Program Service Day Schedule will be developed for each residential mental health program \nto maximize out of room time and to ensure structured activity based on evidence based \nprinciples for 40 to 70 percent of waking hours. The program service day schedule will ensure \nthat youth will be actively engaged in developmentally appropriate and rehabilitative activities \nwith the expectation that they will spend minimal time in their rooms during normal waking \nhours.  \n \nTreatment in Residential Mental Health Programs \nTreatment in residential mental health programs is based primarily on cognitive-behavioral skills \ndevelopment and positive reinforcement for improvements in behavior and on access to \nappropriate mental health treatment and psychiatric intervention, including psychiatric evaluation \nand medication management, as needed. Program components emphasize cognitive and \nbehavioral skill acquisition in anger control, emotional regulation, conflict resolution, effective \ncommunication, behavior analysis related to the maladaptive behavior, and individualized \npsychological services. These elements will be incorporated into DJJ’s Integrated Behavior \nTreatment Model. \n \nSchool for Youth in Residential Mental Health Programs \nEducation is provided for all youth in residential mental health programs who do not have a high \nschool diploma or GED. Using the same criteria as applied in core programs, education directed \nat gaining a GED rather than a High School diploma will be provided, when appropriate. \n \nEducation for youth in ITPs and IBTPs will take place on the unit in small classrooms consistent \nwith the Education Remedial Plan. Staffing for the school area is described in the Education \nRemedial Plan. Youth in SCPs will attend school in the facility’s education program area (see \nEducation Remedial Plan). \n \n    Page 30 \n\n \nHigh School Graduates (and those with GEDs) in Residential Mental Health Programs \nRehabilitation/treatment in residential mental health programs will include meaningful post-\nsecondary education through the use of remote learning and other strategies, or acquisition and \npractice of job-related skills as appropriate. \n \nHigh school graduates may also be assigned to a part-time job within the living unit. As \nappropriate, this plan will include the same opportunities for work and work training as \ndescribed in the Safety and Welfare Plan for youth in the core program. \n \nSubstance Abuse/Dependence and Sex Behavior Treatment \nIn addition to intensive mental health treatment, youth in residential mental health programs will \nalso receive sex behavior treatment and/or substance abuse/dependence treatment as needed and \nconsistent with the treatment hierarchy. \n \nImplementation of Residential Mental Health Programs \nImplementation of residential mental health program units will be phased in over time and will \nrequire facility modifications and/or the addition of modular buildings to ensure adequate space \nfor treatment, recreation, and (for ITPs and IBTPs) education. \n \nIntensive Treatment Program (ITP) \nThe Intensive Treatment Program (ITP) is a residential mental health treatment program for \nyouth displaying a wide range of psychological and psychiatric problems that require intensive \nmental health services and staffing in a sub-acute, rehabilitative setting. Some of these problems \nmay include self-harm behavior and ideation, behavioral dyscontrol, emotional dysregulation, \nand psychiatric disorders. These youth require a full range of psychological, psychiatric and \nsupportive services but are not an imminent danger to themselves or others and do not require an \ninpatient level of care in a licensed facility or the use of clinical restraints. The ITP is a \ntreatment-focused program that utilizes intensive cognitive-behavioral and psychiatric \ninterventions for youth to promote emotional regulation and increased behavioral control.  \n \nStaffing Standards for ITP Living Units \nITP staffing patterns may change in future years as living unit size is reduced. In the first year of \nimplementation, the staffing pattern on ITP units will be as follows.  \n \n•  1 Supervising case manager \n•  1 Senior Youth Correctional Counselor  \n•  0.5 Psychiatrist  \n•  2 Case managers  \n•  0.5 Senior Psychologist, Supervisor \n•  2 Psychologists, Clinical \n•  2 Licensed Psychiatric Technicians (one per 2nd & 3rd watch, seven days a week) \n•  2 Registered Nurses (one per 2nd & 3rd watch, seven days a week) \n•  7 Youth Correctional Counselors  \n•  1 Youth Correctional Officer (1st watch) \n•  1 Office Technician \n•  Educational personnel assigned pursuant to the Education Remedial Plan. \n \n    Page 31 \n\n \nStaff Schedule for ITP Living Units \nThe staff coverage schedule for ITP living units is to accomplish the following objectives: \n \n1.  The Clinical Psychologist’s and case managers’ schedules will overlap that of the two \nshifts of Youth Correctional Counselors. This will allow coaching, consultation, and \ntreatment team coordination with YCCs. \n2.  The Senior Youth Correctional Counselor’s hours will be such that he/she is able to \nprovide direct supervision of all Youth Correctional Counselors at least once a week.  \n3.  There will be no fewer than three Youth Correctional Counselors on the second shift \nseven days a week. \n4.  There will be no fewer than four Youth Correctional Counselors on the third shift seven \ndays a week. \n \nITP Referral Criteria \nDJJ’s criteria for referral to an Intensive Treatment Program include:  \n \n1.  Treatment interfering mental health symptoms that cannot be managed at a lower level of \ncare. \n2.  Mental status changes that interfere with functioning at lower levels of care. \n3.  Self-harm behavior or ideation, suicidal ideation. \n4.  Behavioral dyscontrol secondary to a mental illness. \n5.  Emotional dysregulation requiring increased support. \n6.  Marked decline in psychosocial functioning as the result of a mental disorder, including \nmajor impairment in school, peer relations, judgment, cognition, and/or affect. \n7.  Structured assessments of global functioning (such as the Child and Adolescent \nFunctional Assessment Scale) may be used to assist in ITP versus SCP (see below) \nplacement determinations. \n \nSpecialized Counseling Program (SCP) \nThe Specialized Counseling Program (SCP) is a residential mental health treatment program for \nyouth displaying a wide range of moderate psychological and psychiatric problems that require \nmental health services and staffing in a sub-acute, rehabilitative setting. Some of these problems \nmay include minor self-harm behavior and ideation, behavioral dyscontrol, emotional \ndysregulation, and psychiatric disorders. Some of these youth may be less sophisticated and \nlower functioning (social, emotional, cognitive) than other incarcerated youth and may be \nvulnerable to abuse by others. These youth require a full range of psychological, psychiatric and \nsupportive services but are not an imminent danger to themselves or others and do not require an \ninpatient level of care in a licensed facility or the use of clinical restraints. The SCP is a \ntreatment-focused program that utilizes intensive cognitive-behavioral intervention and \npsychiatric interventions for youth to promote emotional regulation, social skills \ntraining/acquisition, and increased behavioral control.  \n \nStaffing Standards for SCP Living Units \nSCP staffing patterns may change in future years as living unit size is reduced. In the first year of \nimplementation, the staffing pattern on SCP units will be as follows.  \n \n    Page 32 \n\n \n•  1 Supervising case manager \n•  1 Senior Youth Correctional Counselor  \n•  0.5 Psychiatrist  \n•  0.5 Senior Psychologist, Supervisor  \n•  2 Case managers \n•  1 Psychologist, Clinical \n•  2 Licensed Psychiatric Technicians (one per 2nd & 3rd watch, seven days a week) \n•  7 Youth Correctional Counselors \n•  1 Youth Correctional Officer (1st watch) \n \nStaff Schedule for SCP Living Units \nThe staff coverage schedule for SCP units is to accomplish the following objectives: \n \n1.  The Clinical Psychologist and Casework Specialists schedules will overlap that of the \ntwo shifts of Youth Correctional Counselors. This will allow coaching, consultation, and \ntreatment team coordination with YCCs. \n2.  The Senior Youth Correctional Counselor’s hours will be such that he/she is able to \nprovide direct supervision of all Youth Correctional Counselors at least once a week.  \n3.  There will be no fewer than three Youth Correctional Counselors on the second shift \nseven days a week. \n4.  There will be no fewer than four Youth Correctional Counselors on the third shift seven \ndays a week. \n \nSCP Referral Criteria \nDJJ’s criteria for referral to a Specialized Counseling Program include:  \n \n1.  Treatment interfering mental health symptoms that cannot be managed at a lower level of \ncare. \n2.  Mental status changes that interfere with functioning at lower levels of need. \n3.  Minor self-harm behavior or ideation, suicidal ideation. \n4.  Behavioral dyscontrol secondary to a mental illness. \n5.  Emotional dysregulation requiring increased support. \n6.  Moderate difficulty in several areas, including school, peer relations, judgment, \ncognition, and/or affect. \n7.  Structured assessments of global functioning (such as the Child and Adolescent \nFunctional Assessment Scale) may be used to assist in SCP versus ITP placement \ndeterminations. (See ITP referral criteria, above.) \n \n    Page 33 \n\n \nIntensive Behavior Treatment Program (IBTP) \nThe Intensive Behavior Treatment Program (IBTP) is a behavior treatment intervention for youth \nexhibiting violently disruptive behavior that is determined to be driven by a mental illness. The \nIntensive Behavior Treatment Program is a more secure, behavioral treatment-focused program \nthat utilizes intensive cognitive-behavioral and psychiatric interventions for youths who are not \nable to manage their aggressive behavior in a less restrictive environment due to their mental \nillness. \n \nStaffing Standards for IBTP Living Units \nIBTP staffing patterns may change in future years as living unit size is reduced. In the first year \nof implementation, the staffing pattern on IBTP units will be as follows.  \n \n•  2 Clinical Psychologists \n•  0.5 Psychiatrist \n•  0.5 Senior Psychologist, Supervisor \n•  2 Licensed Psychiatric Technicians (1 per 2nd & 3rd watch, seven days per week) \n•  2 Registered Nurses  \n•  2 Casework Specialist or equivalent  \n•  1 Supervising Casework Specialist or equivalent  \n•  1 Senior Youth Correctional Counselor  \n•  7 Youth Correctional Counselors  \n•  3 Youth Correctional Officers (1 on first watch, 2 on 2nd and 2 on 3rd watch) \n•  1 Office Technician \n•  Educational personnel assigned pursuant to the Education Remedial Plan. \n•  1 Youth Correctional Counselor for every occupied classroom \n \nStaff Schedule for IBTP Living Units \nThe staff coverage schedule for IBTP units is to accomplish the following objectives: \n \n1.  The Clinical Psychologists’ and Casework Specialists’ schedules will overlap that of the \ntwo shifts of Youth Correctional Counselors. This will allow coaching, consultation, and \ntreatment team coordination with YCCs. \n2.  The Senior Youth Correctional Counselor’s hours will be such that he/she is able to \nprovide direct supervision of all Youth Correctional Counselors at least once a week.  \n3.  There will be no fewer than three Youth Correctional Counselors on the second shift \nseven days a week. \n4.  There will be no fewer than four Youth Correctional Counselors on the third shift seven \ndays a week. \n5.  Every occupied classroom will have a teacher and a Youth Correctional Counselor. \n \nIBTP Referral Criteria \nDJJ’s initial criteria for referral to an Intensive Behavioral Treatment Program are that a youth \nhas, or is suspected of having, a mental illness and one or more of the following behaviors within \nthe last 90 days that is believed to be related to a known or suspected mental illness: \n \n1.  Battery on a staff member \n2.  Battery on a youth with a weapon \n    Page 34 \n\n \n3.  Serious battery on a youth without a weapon \n4.  Aggressor in a group physical attack \n5.  Aggressor in a group disturbance \n6.  Return from a CDCR adult facility where the youth was last assigned to a Security \nHousing Unit (SHU) because of aggressive or violent behavior and the youth has a \nhistory of receiving mental health services. \n \nInpatient Psychiatric Care \nPursuant to state law and the Safety & Welfare Remedial Plan, DJJ will collaborate with state \nand local stakeholders to find appropriate mental health placements for youth with serious \nmental health disorders requiring long-term inpatient care. DJJ seeks to reduce, rather than \nexpand, the number of youth in its care who require long-term inpatient mental health services. \nTo the extent that such youth are discovered in DJJ, they will be returned to the committing court \nor referred to DMH or other treatment facilities outside of DJJ for inpatient care.  \n \nDJJ recognizes that, despite these efforts, some youth in its care will require inpatient services. \nFor youth requiring inpatient services, DJJ will comply with state law and regulations requiring \nthat inpatient health services be provided in licensed facilities. The inpatient level of care \nincludes long term and short term acute, sub-acute and intermediate care that psychiatric units in \nhospitals provide, and sub- or non-acute care that is provided in skilled nursing or similar \nfacilities for mentally ill persons who require 24 hour nursing and/or related services (see Title \n22 California Code of Regulations §§ 79751 and 79753).  \n \nCurrently, DJJ provides inpatient mental health care at its own 10-bed Correctional Treatment \nCenter (CTC) at the Heman G. Stark Youth Correctional Facility, by Memorandum of \nUnderstanding with DMH, and by contract with community facilities for acute/crisis care. The \nMOU with DMH provides for 10 inpatient beds in DMH hospitals for youth 18 and older and 20 \nIntermediate Care Facility (ICF) beds at the Southern Youth Correctional Reception Center and \nClinic. DJJ has two contracts with local community mental health facilities for acute and \nintermediate care for females. Additionally, if there is an emergency psychiatric situation, DJJ \nwill send any youth to a local emergency room with appropriate mental health service capacity, \nregardless of whether DJJ has a contract with the hospital. DJJ will continue to provide these \ninpatient resources unless and until an alternative arrangement is approved by the Consent \nDecree mental health experts.  \n \nIn consultation with the Consent Decree mental health experts, DJJ will reassess the adequacy of \nthis combination of resources, and make plans and adjustments as necessary. \n \nAcute/Crisis Stabilization Level of Care \nThis level of care is characterized by the need for 24 hour per day nursing and mental health \nservices in a licensed facility for youth who are in imminent danger to self or others that exceeds \nthe ability of lower levels of care to maintain safety. Youth requiring clinically indicated \nrestraints to maintain safety may be placed at this level of care. Clinical restraints – including \nrestraint chairs – will not be used in any unlicensed facility. The anticipated average length of \nstay is relatively short - from a few days to a month - although exceptional cases may require \nlonger stays.  \n \n    Page 35 \n\n \nDJJ’s Correctional Treatment Center accepted its first mental health patient in April 2006. Most \npatients treated in the CTC have been from Southern California facilities (Heman G. Stark and \nSYRCC), but youth have been transferred from Stockton complex facilities to the CTC. DJJ will \ntransfer youth from Northern California facilities to the CTC at Heman G. Stark when it does not \nhave an adequate community facility option. The means of transport will be clinically \ndetermined by a treating or supervising clinician.  \n \nBetween April 15 and July 31, the average length of stay of youth who have been released from \nthe CTC has been 15.7 days. The following diagram shows the daily count in the CTC from the \ntime it was opened through the end of July 2006. \nDaily Count - H.G. Stark Correctional Treatment Center \nApril 15, 2006 - July 31, 2006 (Capacity = 10)\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n15-Apr 22-Apr 29-Apr 6-May 3-May 0-May 7-May 3-Jun 10-Jun 17-Jun 24-Jun 1-Jul 8-Jul 15-Jul 22-Jul 29-Jul\n1 2 2\n   \nAdmission Criteria \nAdmission to acute inpatient psychiatric care will be based on: \n \n1.  Imminent danger to self. \n2.  Imminent danger to others as a result of a serious mental health disorder. \n3.  Marked impairment in psychosocial functioning and activities of daily living, requiring \n24-hour nursing care. \n4.  Safety concerns, which are a result of a serious mental health disorder, requiring clinical \nrestraints. \n \nDischarge Criteria \nDischarge from acute inpatient psychiatric care will be based on: \n \n1.  Stabilization of the crisis behavior, and \n2.  No imminent danger to self or others, and \n3.  Improved psychosocial functioning, consistent with placement in a lower acuity setting.  \n \n    Page 36 \n\n \nIntermediate Level of Psychiatric Care  \nThe intermediate level of psychiatric care, such as that provided by a hospital or an ICF, is \ncharacterized by the need for 24 hour per day nursing supervision or related mental health \nservices in a licensed facility. (For example, as defined for an ICF, intermediate care means \n\"beds designated for patients requiring skilled nursing and supportive care on less than a \ncontinuous basis.\" See 22 CCR § 73050.) This level of care is for youth who are not an acute \nimminent danger to self or others but who have severe and persistent mental illness that exceeds \nthe ability of lower levels of care to maintain safely, and/or youth requiring more extensive \nand/or specialty evaluation than DJJ commonly provides in its residential mental health \nprograms. Because it is licensed, clinically indicated restraints may be used at this level of care. \nThe lengths of stay will vary. Evaluations will typically be associated with relatively shorter \nlengths of stay, while youth who are not responsive to treatment in lower acuity settings will \nhave longer lengths of stay, generally measured in months. \n \nDJJ currently contracts with DMH for 20 Intermediate Care Facility beds at Southern Youth \nCorrectional Reception Center & Clinic. Between November 2005 and July 2006 the average \nlength of stay in this facility was just under three months (83.5 days). The following figure \nshows daily population at the SYCRCC ICF during this period.  \nDaily Count - SYCRCC Intermediate Care Facility \nNov 1, 2005 - July 31, 2006 (Capacity = 20)\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1-Nov- 15-Nov- 29-Nov- 13-Dec- 27-Dec- 10-Jan- 24-Jan- 7-Feb- 21-Feb- 7-Mar- 21-Mar- 4-Apr- 18-Apr- 2-May- 16-May- 30-May- 13-Jun- 27-Jun- 11-Jul- 25-Jul-\n \nAdmission Criteria \nIn general, admission to the ICF at SYCRCC will be based on: \n \n1.  The youth requires highly structured (staffed) inpatient care with 24-hour nursing \nsupervision and enhanced staffing due to an active major mental illness, significant \nimpairment in psychosocial functioning, stabilization or elimination of self-harm/suicidal \nbehavior (which does not rise to the level of imminent danger to self), or stabilization of \nsymptoms of a serious mental illness. \n    Page 37 \n\n \n2.  The youth would benefit from a comprehensive treatment program with an emphasis on \nskill development/psycho-social rehabilitation, with increased programming and \nsupervision. \n3.  The youth would benefit from a comprehensive assessment for diagnostic clarification. \n \nAnd in general, admission to DMH state hospitals will be based on: \n \n1.  The youth has a major Axis 1 disorder with active symptoms. \n2.  The youth’s GAF over the previous 30-day period is 30 or less. \n3.  The youth is unable to adequately function and stabilize within the structure of the DJJ’s \nmental health treatment programs. \n4.  The youth’s psychiatric condition can potentially be remediated and stabilized within the \nstate hospital treatment program. \n5.  The youth needs to be placed in conservatorship in preparation for parole. \n \nAdditional factors that may justify consideration for referral to the ICF, a DMH state hospital, or \nanother facility offering intermediate psychiatric care include: \n \n1.  The youth requires further medical, neurological or neuropsychological consultation, \nevaluation or studies that cannot be provided in a less restrictive setting. \n2.  There are other medication issues requiring treatment in a subacute inpatient setting. \n3.  The youth requires complicated psychiatric medication management.  \n \nDischarge Criteria \nDischarge from intermediate inpatient psychiatric care (including the ICF, DMH state hospitals, \nand community mental health facilities) will be based on: \n \n1.  Improved functioning, with the ability to function in a less clinically structured \nenvironment.  \n2.  The diagnostic, consultative, or trial treatment goals for referring the youth to an \nintermediate inpatient psychiatric facility have been met or no longer need to be pursued.  \n \nIn addition to the intermediate care facility operated by DMH, contract beds are available \nthrough other providers for wards needing long term intermediate care. Treatment at an \nintermediate inpatient psychiatric facility can be for diagnostic and assessment purposes \n(requiring a relatively short length of stay) or for treatment of an active major mental illness \n(which may require a longer length of stay). DJJ contracts for such services with the DMH and \ncommunity facilities and the above criteria are illustrative of the admission and discharge criteria \nDJJ has negotiated with contractors. Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), as agreed to by DJJ \nand DMH, outline the specific criteria and process for admission to, and discharge from, the \nDMH-run ICF at SYCRCC and DMH state hospitals. Additionally, prior to transferring a youth \nto a DMH facility, DJJ mental health staff confer with DMH staff regarding the appropriateness \nof the proposed transfer. When youth are under the care and treatment of DMH, they are \nprovided care in accordance with DMH’s policies and procedures, including in accordance with \nDMH’s staffing ratios, treatment plans, and documentation systems.  \n \n \n    Page 38 \n\n \nMovement between Levels of Care and Programs \nMovement between levels of care and programs will be based on clinical judgment with \ncentralized clinical oversight. As appropriate, the clinical judgment will take into account \nobjective assessments using standardized and (where available) validated instruments. Data used \nto determine movement between levels of care may be obtained from:  \n \n1.  Symptom/behavior specific instruments such as the Children’s Depression Inventory \n(CDI), the Behavioral Assessment Rating Scale (BASC), the Structured Assessment of \nViolence Risk in Youth (SAVRY), the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory \n(SASSI) (Reference: Miller FG, Lazowski LE. The Adolescent Substance Abuse Subtle \nScreening Inventory-A2 (SASSI-A2) manual. Springville, IN: SASSI Institute, 2001), or \na suicide risk assessment scale. These instruments are used in conjunction with guideline \ncutoffs for various levels of care.  \n2.  Assessments of general functioning, such as the Child and Adolescent Functional \nAssessment Scale (CAFAS) (Reference: Hodges K. Child and Adolescent Functional \nAssessment Scale (3rd ed.). Ypsilanti: Eastern Michigan University, 2000), the Child and \nAdolescent Level of Care Utilization System (CALOCUS), the Vanderbilt Functioning \nIndex, or the Strengths and Difficulties Scale (SDQ). \n3.  Instruments DJJ currently uses (such as the SPAN) that could adapted to inform \nmovement between levels of care.  \n4.  Documented presence or absence of specific behaviors as applicable (such as \nsuicidal/self-harm, aggressive or sexually inappropriate behavior). \n5.  Consistent youth self-report (beyond responses on specific assessment instruments) of \nurges of inappropriate behavior and demonstrated ability to immediately inform staff of \nurges and contract for safety. \n6.  Clinical impression, including input from any staff who have contact with the youth as \nwell as information gained from clinical interview and assessment combined with results \nfrom above instruments and related data. \n7.  Treatment failure in current level of care. \n \nPolicies and procedures will be developed to guide and direct movement between mental health \nlevels of care and programs. Elements of the policies and procedures for movement between \nmental health levels of care and programs will include: \n \n1.  Indications and processes for emergency transfer. \n2.  Regularly scheduled multidisciplinary team review of appropriateness of youth for \ncurrent level of care and consideration of movement to a different program within the \nsame, or a different, level of care. \n3.  Processes for initiating consideration of movement between programs and levels of care. \n4.  Process for decision-making, including resolving differences of opinion between \ntransferring and receiving units/teams. \n5.  Relationship between clinical and administrative decisions and quality improvement \nprocess regarding concurrence. \n6.  Communication of pertinent information between transferring and receiving units/teams. \n7.  Program improvement process to refine decision-making. \n \nRecommendations for movement to a more restrictive level of care will be reviewed by a \ncentralized mental health team which makes a determination if the referral is consistent with \n    Page 39 \n\n \nentrance criteria and if the placement is appropriate. All beds and movement will be centrally \ncoordinated. Placements will be consistent with decisions made through this acceptance process. \nA Memorandum of Understanding between DJJ and DMH governs movement between these \nDepartments. \n \nFuture Needs Assessment \nInpatient Services \nThe June 2002 Revised And Stipulated Order for Enforcement of Judgment (“Stipulated Order”) \nin Morris v. Harper (now Wilber v. Warner) requires DJJ to comply with state law requiring that \ninpatient mental health care be provided in licensed beds. In connection with the proceedings in \nthe Wilber case, licensing and certification staff of the Department of Health Services had found \nthat DJJ was providing inpatient care in unlicensed facilities. In October 2005, the plaintiff in the \nWilber case agreed to postpone enforcement proceedings pending development of this Mental \nHealth Remedial Plan.  \n \nThe June 2002 Stipulated Order reflected DJJ's intention to complete and license Correctional \nTreatment Centers in three locations – one for male youth in northern, one for male youth in \nsouthern California, and one for female youth at Ventura – and to convert a facility into an ICF \nat SYCRCC. When it agreed to the Stipulated Order, DJJ believed that it would be necessary to \ncomplete and license these facilities in order to meet youths’ needs for inpatient mental health \ncare. Since then, DJJ has built or renovated two facilities intended to become licensed CTCs: one \nat Ventura facility and one at Heman G. Stark. DJJ secured a CTC license at Heman G. Stark \nwhere youth have been receiving inpatient mental health treatment since April 2006. It arranged \nfor Metropolitan State Hospital, DMH to operate a licensed ICF at SYRCC. DJJ renovated the \nbuilding at Ventura intended to be a CTC, but did not proceed with licensing when it decided \ninstead to contract with community facilities for inpatient care for the few young women who \nrequire that level of care. \n \nSince June 2002, DJJ’s population has been reduced by about one-half, to fewer than 3,000 \nyouth. The female population has been reduced from more than 300 to about 125-150. DJJ \nbelieves that it is able to meet all needs for inpatient care in licensed beds with its current \nfacilities and arrangements with community facilities and DMH. \n \nPlaintiff’s counsel and counsel for the plaintiff in the Wilber case believe that there likely is a \nneed for CTC or ICF beds in northern California and for young women. It is impossible to \nresolve this dispute at this time because DJJ is unable to produce some of the information that is \ncritical to a bed needs analysis. Also, the mental health Consent Decree experts are not \nconvinced that DJJ is able to reliably determine that youth who require inpatient care are always \nreferred for such care. This is important since youth requiring, but not referred for, inpatient care \nwould not be captured in utilization data. Finally, over the next four years, DJJ’s mental health \nprograms will undergo substantial changes, including the training of all DJJ staff who interact \nwith youth on the Integrated Behavioral Treatment model, the implementation of new mental \nhealth screening and assessment tools, the expansion of mental health and behavioral health \nservices to all youth, and planning for renovation and building of facilities. These changes are \nlikely to affect the need for inpatient care. \n \nIn collaboration with the mental health Consent Decree experts, and with assistance from the \nDepartment of Health Services Licensing and Certification Division, and the Department of \n    Page 40 \n\n \nMental Health, DJJ will evaluate the sufficiency of its number and type of inpatient beds, taking \ninto account the treatment needs of the youth population by age, gender, home community, and \nassigned institutional placement. In collaboration with the mental health Consent Decree experts, \nDJJ will develop systems to track utilization of licensed beds and indicators suggestive of unmet \nneed for inpatient care. DJJ will use these data and systems to refine and/or modify plans and \nimplementation schedules to meet the needs of youth for inpatient care.  \n \nAs new facilities are being built and as new mental health needs are identified, DJJ will work \nwith DHS Licensing and Certification to explore licensing options. DJJ will also seek the \nassistance of the Licensing and Certification Division to ensure that it successfully distinguishes \nbetween youth who may be treated in nonlicensed DJJ mental health programs and youth who \nare required to be treated in licensed facilities. DJJ will develop screening and assessment \npolicies and procedures that clarify the distinction. \n \nInpatient Services for Northern California Males \nWhile the services available to serve Southern California males in DJJ facilities are reasonably \ncomprehensive, the continuum of care is much more limited in Northern California. As noted \nabove, the Stipulated Order in the Wilber case reflected an agreement between plaintiff’s counsel \nin Wilber and DJJ that DJJ would expand the continuum of care in Northern California by \nbuilding a licensed facility at the Stockton complex. DJJ did not proceed with that plan.  \nPresently, DJJ provides inpatient care for males in northern California by contract with a \ncommunity mental health facility in Sacramento, by having access to available beds at Napa \nState Hospital under the Memorandum of Understanding with DMH, and by sending northern \nCalifornia youth to southern California facilities for acute and intermediate inpatient care.12 \nAdditionally, if there is an emergency psychiatric situation, DJJ will send any youth to a local \nemergency room with appropriate mental health service capacity, regardless of whether DJJ has \na contract with the hospital. \n \nDJJ will work with the Consent Decree mental health experts to evaluate current practices, and if \nappropriate, propose alternative solutions. In particular, the experts will provide input on the \nadequacy of contract services (for youth under 18 and those 18 and older), treatment concerns \nrelated to transporting youth needing inpatient care, and the impact on family involvement and \ncontinuity of care for Northern California youth transported to Southern California.  \n \nIn order to make an informed decision about the need for licensed inpatient beds at the Stockton \ncomplex, DJJ will work with the mental health Consent Decree experts to fill existing \ninformation gaps with respect to acute and subacute bed needs.  \n \nIn consultation with the mental health Consent Decree experts, DJJ will reassess the adequacy of \nits current and planned combination of resources for Northern California, and make any \nnecessary plans and adjustments, including plans with respect to licensed acute and/or subacute \nbeds.  \n \n                                                 \n12 The Memorandum of Understanding with DMH is for ten acute or intermediate care beds that are in addition to \nthe ICF beds at SYCRCC. \n    Page 41 \n\n \nInpatient Services for Females \nDJJ currently operates no inpatient beds for females; instead, DJJ has two contracts with local \ncommunity mental health facilities for acute and intermediate care. DJJ also has the capacity to \nsend girls, age 18 and older, to DMH state hospitals for intermediate care. Additionally, if there \nis an emergency psychiatric situation, DJJ will send any youth to a local emergency room with \nappropriate mental health service capacity, regardless of whether DJJ has a contract with the \nhospital. DJJ believes that it is meeting the needs of female youth for inpatient mental health \ncare. In contrast, Plaintiff believes that inpatient care is being provided in the unlicensed DJJ \nmental health programs at Ventura. \n  \nIn response to the Wilber v. Warner litigation, DJJ began the process of implementing a CTC at \nthe Ventura facility by remodeling a building for that purpose. However, the facility has never \nbeen licensed. Now, given the much smaller number of females in the system than existed at the \ntime the litigation was started, and given the possibility of moving females out of Ventura and \ncloser to their home communities (see Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan), reconsideration of the \nneed for a CTC at Ventura is warranted.  \n \nDJJ will work with the Consent Decree mental health experts to evaluate the adequacy of current \ncontracting arrangements and, as needed and in accordance with the experts’ recommendations, \nwill develop alternative arrangements targeted for Northern and Southern California females, and \nfemales under the age of 18 and those 18 and older. \n \nResidential Mental Health Care \nAs the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Services becomes operational and is assessed, it may be \nfound that additional levels of intensity (such as group home/reentry) and specialized \nprogramming (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for the effects of previous trauma) are \nneeded. It may also be found that the current structure of mental health programs requires \nrefinement. Over the course of the next three years, DJJ will work with the Consent Decree \nmental health experts to make these determinations and, if changes are needed, DDJ will develop \nand implement a plan to modify the levels of care in its mental health programs. In collaboration \nwith the Consent Decree mental health experts, DJJ’s will devise program improvement \nprocesses which will include mechanisms for assessing and, as appropriate, adapting and \nadopting innovative programs for youth in DJJ custody. \n \nIn particular, the mental health experts consulted in the development of this Plan have \nrecommended that DJJ consider whether there is utility in having two levels of residential mental \nhealth care – ITP and SCP – versus one, during the initial transition phase.  \n \nIn consultation with the Consent Decree experts, DJJ will evaluate the ITPs and SCPs and \ndetermine whether/how to modify their roles and target populations. DJJ will provide its \nevaluation and determination in writing, with a summary of the Consent Decree experts’ \nopinions and recommendations on the matter, to the Consent Decree experts, the Special Master \nand plaintiff’s counsel.  \n \n    Page 42 \n\n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  All direct care staff will be trained on the Integrated Behavior Treatment Model in \naccordance with the implementation schedule for core program rehabilitation/treatment units \ndescribed in the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan and the implementation schedule for \nintensive treatment units as described below. \n \n2.  DJJ will develop a treatment hierarchy as described in this section as part of the Integrated \nBehavior Treatment Model on the timeframe described in the Safety and Welfare Remedial \nPlan. \n \n3.  DJJ will develop and implement a policy regarding forensic evaluations that is consistent \nwith the principles discussed in this section by June 1, 2007. \n \n4.  In consultation with national experts, DJJ will develop a new Substance Abuse/Dependence \nTreatment Program, including admission and exit criteria, as part of the Integrated Behavior \nTreatment Model on the timeframe described in the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan. The \nnew Substance Abuse/Dependence Treatment Program will be implemented by July 1, 2009.  \n \n5.  DJJ will appoint a mental health program administrator at each facility with one or more \nresidential mental health program prior to the date the program is implemented (or an \nexisting program is modified) as described in this section. \n \n6.   In consultation with the Consent Decree mental health experts, DJJ will adopt formal criteria \nfor referring youth to each mental health level of care described in this section. These criteria \nwill be fully implemented no later than January 31, 2007. \n \n7.  DJJ will establish a centralized Mental Health Review Team to review recommendations for \nplacement or a youth in an inpatient or residential mental health program and \nrecommendations for changes in levels of care. This review team will be responsible for \ndetermining if these recommendations are appropriate. The Mental Health Review Team will \nbe in place prior to bringing the first modified, or new, residential mental health living unit \non line. \n \n8.  In consultation with the Consent Decree mental health experts, DJJ will develop a policy and \nprocedure for developing a treatment plan for each youth within three working days of \nadmission to a residential mental health unit, for weekly treatment team meetings, and for \nmonthly treatment team reviews to evaluate the need for continued stay in the program, \nrefinement of the treatment plan, or recommendation for placement in an alternative \ntreatment program. This policy and procedure will be implemented by June 30, 2007. \n \n9.  In consultation with Consent Decree mental health experts, DJJ will develop policies and \nprocedures to guide and direct movement between mental health levels of care and programs. \nThese policies and procedures will be fully implemented by July 31, 2007. DJJ will continue \nwith its current process of central monitoring and oversight until policies and new procedures \nare in place. \n \n    Page 43 \n\n \n10. DJJ will establish a protocol so that monthly treatment team reviews for any youth who has \nbeen in an IBTP or SCP for more than four months, or an ITP for more than two months, \nincludes participation by at least one clinician not regularly involved in the treatment of the \nyouth. This protocol will include the requirement for ongoing participation by a clinician not \ninvolved in the youth’s treatment and central office review of treatment team meetings \nrequiring the presence of an outside clinician consistent with this section. This protocol will \nbe established and implemented by June 1, 2007.  \n \n11.  No later than July 31, 2007, DJJ will have increased outpatient mental health staff consistent \nwith the staffing standards included in this section. \n \n12. By July 1, 2007, DJJ will implement five (5) Intensive Treatment Programs, seven (7) \nSpecialized Counseling Programs, and one (1) Intensive Behavior Treatment Program, as \ndescribed in this section.  \n \n13. In fiscal year 2007/2008, DJJ will establish one additional Intensive Treatment Program and \none additional Intensive Behavior Treatment Program.  \n \nThe intent of Actions Plan items 12 and 13 is to create sufficient capacity at each level of \ncare to provide for the mental health needs of all youth in a timely way. Compliance will be \nmeasured by providing sufficient capacity, with minimal waiting time for youth, not simply \nby adding the units listed above. Consequently, plans for mental health treatment units may \nbe modified based on the analysis of populations and needs for various levels of care, as \ndescribed in this section.  \n \n14. No later than June 30, 2007, DJJ will reduce the maximum size of its ITP and SCP living \nunits to 30, and its IBTP living units to 20 (exclusive of mentors).  \n \n15. No later than June 30, 2008, DJJ will reduce the maximum size of its ITP and SCP living \nunits to 24, and its IBTP living units to no more than 16 (exclusive of mentors). \n \n16. By June 30, 2010, DJJ will reduce the maximum number of youth in its residential mental \nhealth programs to the size determined in conjunction with the Consent Decree mental health \nand safety and welfare experts. \n \n17. DJJ will determine the appropriate size of mental health living units in new facilities planned \nand implemented on the master planning schedule provided for in the Safety and Welfare \nRemedial Plan. \n \n18. DJJ will develop a Program Service Day Schedule for each intensive treatment unit prior to \nbringing it on line. These schedules will be developed to ensure constructive program hours \nand out-of-room time consistent with the standards articulated in this section. \n \n19. By no later than December 31, 2006, DJJ will develop written policies and procedures on \ntransfer to DMH, or return to the committing court, of youth requiring long-term inpatient \ncare in a licensed facility.  \n \n    Page 44 \n\n \n20. By November 30, 2006, DJJ will collaborate with DMH to strengthen communication, \nexpedite transfers to DMH of youth who are appropriately referred for inpatient mental \nhealth services, and facilitate transition of youth no longer in need of such care back to DJJ \nfacilities.  \n \n21. In the Standards and Criteria section, DJJ will identify an expert approved by the Consent \nDecree mental health experts and plaintiff’s counsel to conduct an assessment and projection \nof the numbers and types of beds needed for each level of care and to develop an ongoing \nsystem to track the need for and use of those beds. The systems will be in place, and reports \ngenerated on a monthly basis by a date to be determined in the Standards and Criteria \nsection. \n \n22. By a date set in the Standards and Criteria section, and in consultation with the Consent \nDecree mental health experts and the expert identified pursuant to the preceding paragraph, \nDJJ will determine if modification to the current array of residential mental health programs, \nespecially ITPs and SCPs, is appropriate and needed. DJJ will provide its evaluation and \ndetermination in writing, with a summary of the experts’ opinions and recommendations, to \nthe Consent Decree experts, the Special Master and plaintiff’s counsel. Any \nrecommendations to modify the ITPs and SCPs will be implemented by a date to be set in the \nStandards and Criteria section. \n \n23. DJJ will work with the Consent Decree mental health experts to evaluate current practices, \nand if appropriate, propose alternative solutions for contract mental health beds. In particular, \nthe experts will provide input on the adequacy of contract services and, based on objective \nevidence, treatment concerns relating to transporting youth needing acute inpatient care, and \nthe impact on family involvement and continuity of care for Northern California youth \ntransported to Southern California for acute or subacute care. This evaluation will address \ncontract services for males and females and youth under 18 and those 18 and older. This \nevaluation will be completed no later than January 31, 2007. \n \n24. Based on the analysis of the tracking data and evaluation of use of contract beds noted above, \nDJJ will reassess the adequacy of current inpatient resources for females and for Northern \nCalifornia males, and make any necessary plans to ensure timely and appropriate care for \nyouth in need of inpatient services, including plans with respect to licensed acute and/or sub-\nacute beds, no later than four (4) months following completion of the analysis and evaluation. \nDJJ will begin implementing these plans the following fiscal year. \n \n25. As new facilities are being built and new mental health needs are identified, DJJ will work \nwith DHS Licensing and Certification to explore licensing options in a timely manner. DJJ \nwill also seek the assistance of the Licensing and Certification Division to ensure that it \nsuccessfully distinguishes between youth who may be treated in nonlicensed DJJ mental \nhealth programs and youth who are required to be treated in licensed facilities. DJJ will \ndevelop screening and assessment policies and procedures that clarify the distinction by June \n30, 2007. \n \n26. Over the course of the next three years, DJJ will develop an implementation plan to \nincorporate additional interventions into the IBTM. The priority and type of interventions \nwill be determined in conjunction with the Consent Decree mental health experts. \n    Page 45 \n\n \n \n27. By November 20, 2006, DJJ will develop a system to track and objectively prioritize youth \nplaced on waiting lists for residential mental health programs. \n    Page 46 \n\n \nSection 6 \nEVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT \n \nTHE ISSUE \nThe efficacy of treatment, as well as the wise use of public resources, requires that rehabilitative \ntreatment be based on the best evidence based practices available. \n \nDISCUSSION \nEvidence Based Psychosocial Treatments \nThere are several important principles to keep in mind regarding the topic of evidence based \npsychosocial and psychopharmacological treatments within the juvenile justice population: \n \n1.  Although there are numerous studies of effective evidence based psychosocial treatments \nwithin the general population, few of these treatments have been studied and validated \nwithin the juvenile justice population. Thus there is a gap between psychotherapy \nresearch and its application with incarcerated youth. The data base regarding \npsychopharmacological interventions is even more restricted (Soller, et al., 2006). \n2.  Many of the evidence based treatments target individuals with single psychiatric \ndiagnoses. Given the high comorbidity of youth within the DJJ system, it will often be \nnecessary to prioritize and select either a principle psychiatric diagnosis or target \nbehavior when selecting specific treatment interventions. \n3.  Many of the evidence based treatment approaches incorporate treatment of family \nmembers. In those situations in which it is impossible to involve families, it will be \nnecessary to select treatments that do not require intensive family involvement, or \nmodify treatments to work within the correctional setting. In situations in which families \nare engaged in the treatment regimen, treatments that include a family component will be \nused as appropriate. \n \nTraining in Evidence Based Psychosocial Treatment \nTraining in evidence based psychosocial treatment will take place in three phases. During the \nfirst phase, training in the Integrated Behavior Treatment Model will be disseminated to all \ncategories of staff who have direct contact with youth. This training will be based on the \nschedule described in the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan. This model will become the basis \non which decisions regarding management of maladaptive behavior will be made. Also during \nthe first phase of training, selected individuals will receive instruction on highly specialized \nevidence based treatment interventions that target specific diagnostic entities or target behaviors. \nExamples of such treatments are provided in Table 6.1. \n \n    Page 47 \n\n \nTable 6.1 Mental Disorders (DSM IV-TR) and Potential Treatment Interventions  \nIn Juvenile Justice Populations \n \nMental Disorder  Treatment Model \nTreatment of Adolescent Depression (The Treatment of \nAdolescents with Depression Study Team, 2003) \nDepression \nInterpersonal Therapy (Mufson et al., 1993) \nPsychopharmacological agents. \nSuicide  Dialectical Behavior Therapy (Linehan, 1993) \nCBT (Compton et al., 2004) \nAnxiety Disorder \nPsychopharmacological agents. \nCBT (Cohen et al., 2004) \nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder \nPsychopharmacological agents. \nBipolar Disorder  Mood stabilizing agents. \nDialectical Behavior Therapy (Linehan, 1993) for \nPersonality Disorders  borderline personality disorder \nLow dose antipsychotics \nPotential role for use of atypical antipsychotics and mood \nConduct Disorder \nstabilizing agents (Soller et al., 2006) \nADHD  Psychostimulant and related compounds  \nSubstance abuse/dependence  Potential role of psychopharmacological agents. \nPsychosis  Antipsychotic agents. \nAntipsychotic agents \nAutistic Spectrum Disorder \nBehavior modification programs. \n \nThe second phase of evidence based treatment integration will be the widespread dissemination \nof these specialized treatment interventions to mental health clinicians throughout DJJ’s \nfacilities. The third phase will involve assessment of the efficacy of the treatment and \nmodification of treatments in line with the needs of the DJJ population. This three phase training \nplan is discussed in more detail in Section 7, “Staff Qualifications and Training.” \n \nMaintaining Currency in Evidence Based Treatments \nBecause there is a rapidly expanding body of knowledge about evidence based treatments for \njuvenile offenders, it is important for mental health leaders in DJJ to follow developments in the \nfield. DJJ will establish a budget for developing and maintaining a central library of professional \npublications for mental health clinicians and for ongoing training and attendance at important \nnational and regional conferences by key staff. DJJ’s Chief Psychiatrist and Chief Psychologists \nwill be responsible for overseeing these efforts and for remaining current in their respective areas \nof expertise. \n \nCharacteristics of the DJJ Population \nWhile the DJJ population is much smaller now, and the characteristics of the juvenile population \nmay have changed in the interim, the work of Steiner et al. (2001) provides a potential model to \nconceptualize how evidence based treatment may be provided to the DJJ population. That model \nis based on a statistical analysis conducted as part of the 2001 study to subtype the DJJ \npopulation with mental disorders into four major clusters as summarized in Table 6.2.  \n \n    Page 48 \n\n \nTable 6.2 Diagnostic Clusters and Prevalence Rates in the DJJ Population (2001)13 \n \n    DJJ Frequency (2001) \nCluster  Diagnoses  Males  Females \nMood \nAnxiety  \nI  46%  73% \nBorderline Personality \nOppositional Defiant \nPsychosis \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity \nII  14%  24% \nSchizoid \nSchizotypal \nEating \nIII  Somatoform  4%  15% \nAdjustment \nAlcohol and Substance Abuse \nIV  22%  10% \n(sole disorder) \nAlcohol and Substance \nV  30%  14% \nDependence (sole diagnosis) \n \n \nCluster I consists of mood disorders, anxiety disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder, \nborderline personality disorder (BPD), and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). This cluster is \nprimarily be treated with antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \n(SSRIs), anti-anxiety agents, and mood stabilizers. In the 2001 study, fifty percent of youths \n(male plus female) were present in this cluster.  \n \nIf prevalence rates in 2006 are similar to those shown in Table 6.2, there are about 1,300 males \nand 100 females in Cluster I in the current DJJ population. \n \nCluster II is comprised of psychosis, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and \nschizoid and schizotypal personality disorders. Overall (boys plus girls), fifteen percent of the \nyouths were present in this cluster. While there is some commonality of treatment across these \ndiagnoses (e.g., anti-psychotics, especially new atypical antipsychotic agents for the treatment of \npsychotic symptoms), ADHD would be treated with stimulants and behavior modification. These \ndiagnoses can be thought of as a package because, in contrast to Cluster I, where there is \npredominant disturbance of mood and affect, individuals in Cluster II have predominant \ndisturbance of cognition, thought and attention. \n \nIf prevalence rates in 2006 are similar to those shown in Table 6.2, there are about 400 males and \n30 to 40 females in Cluster II in the current DJJ population. \n \nCluster III consists of disorders rarely seen in DJJ youth: eating disorders, somatoform disorders, \nand adjustment disorders. In contrast to Clusters I and II, disorders in this cluster are most likely \ncoincidental, meaning that, unlike the first two clusters, they probably do not reflect a special \nassociation to delinquent behavior. Of the youths interviewed only one percent meet the criteria \n                                                 \n13 Adapted from Figure 5b, Steiner, et. al. 2001 \n    Page 49 \n\n \nfor eating disorder, two percent for a somatoform disorder, and three percent for an adjustment \ndisorder. While a higher percentage of girls were present in this cluster, overall, only five percent \nof the youths in 2001 were in Cluster III. In addition to their rarity, these disorders also share a \ncommon method of intervention: their progress should be tracked during incarceration (e.g., \nweight tracking), expecting improvement over time without any specific further intervention. A \nparticularly useful tracking mechanism would be the visits to nurse or general physician.  \n \nIf prevalence rates in 2006 are similar to those shown in Table 6.2, there are about 100 males and \n20 to 25 females in Cluster III in the current DJJ population. \n \nCluster IV-V, is comprised of alcohol and substance abuse and dependence. Only youths who \nwere not included in Cluster I-III were included in this cluster. That is, if a youth met the criteria \nfor depression and cannabis dependence, he/she would receive a score of “yes” for Cluster I, but \na score of “no” for Cluster IV-V. Because rates of substance abuse and dependence were so high \n(85 percent), the overlapping comorbidity with other mental health problems needed to be \nseparated. Steiner et al. (2001) propose that juveniles who suffer from combinations of other \ndisorders and substance abuse problems would respond to intervention targeting their other \ncomorbidity (e.g., depression). While mood problems can also arise from substance use, at this \npoint we cannot confidently distinguish the order of events in this study. Overall, thirty-seven \npercent received a diagnosis relevant to substance use without a diagnosis present in one of the \nthree other clusters. More specifically, 20 percent of the sample have problems with abuse and \n27 percent have dependence, the latter requiring long-term therapy along with relapse prevention \nefforts. \n \nIf prevalence rates in 2006 are similar to those shown in Table 6.2, there are about 600 males and \n15 females in the current DJJ population whose sole diagnosis is alcohol and substance \ndependence. Another 860 males and 20 females have a sole diagnosis of alcohol and substance \nabuse. \n   \nSoliciting and Facilitating Family Involvement \nFamily involvement is a key principle of this plan. There are various points in the course of \nconfinement which provide opportunities to involve families. They are at the local county level \n(prior to placement in DJJ), reception center, through facility site visits and phone calls, and \nduring and after transition to the community. Family members may serve as an important \nresource at any or all of these times in the youth’s confinement. Involvement of family is \nparticularly important to successful treatment for those receiving medical/psychiatric care who \nare under age 18. \n \nIt is recognized that in some instances a youth’s parents or caregivers may be unavailable due to \nimpairment, other family priorities, and/or parental “burnout”. However, the majority of families \nare likely to be receptive to participating in some aspect of their youth’s rehabilitation. In \ninteraction with families, staff will be encouraged to highlight small increments of improvement \nby the youth.  \n \nInvolvement of families will be supported by DJJ by measures including, to the extent possible, \nplacement of youth as close to their home community as possible, regularly scheduled family \nmeetings, and regular telephone contact. To the extent possible, DJJ will provide assistance in \narranging or facilitating transportation for family members. This may involve collaboration with \n    Page 50 \n\n \ncommunity and/or advocacy groups, assistance with forming car pools, or direct assistance if \nfunding is available. DJJ will also pursue the use of video-conferencing in situations where \nfamily members are not able to travel to DJJ facilities. \n \nParents or legal guardians of youth under age 18 will be notified within 24 hours of all suicide \nattempts, hospitalizations, serious injuries, or serious offenses committed against the youth \nunless the youth requests that his/her parents or legal guardians not be notified and the Chief \nDeputy Secretary of DJJ determines that it would be in the youth’s best interest to not notify the \nparents or legal guardians. (See California Welfare and Institutions Code section 223.) Parents or \nlegal guardians of youth under age 18 will also be notified of changes in levels of care, unless the \ntreating clinician determines that such notification is contraindicated. Parents or legal guardians \nof youth age 18 and over will be notified within 24 hours of all suicide attempts, hospitalizations, \nserious injuries, serious offenses committed against the youth, and changes in levels of care if the \nyouth has consented to the notification. (See California Welfare and Institutions Code section \n223.) DJJ’s intent is to provide prompt and accurate information to parents and guardians in \norder to involve them with youths’ treatment, but in a manner that is clinically appropriate and \nconsistent with youths’ rights to withhold consent.  \n \nIt should be noted that the definition of “family” varies considerably in different communities \nand that it often extends beyond the nuclear family. In this Plan, relevant family members may \ninclude grandparents, aunts, uncles, neighbors, religious officials, and other community people. \nEngaging and involving individuals using this broad definition of family is not only desirable, \nbut may be necessary for a youth whose nuclear family is either unavailable or non-receptive to \nparticipation in the youth’s rehabilitation. This broad definition of family does not supersede the \ndefinitions set forth in state and federal law and does not extend to issues of legal consent or \nconfidential patient information protected by law. \n \nIntake and Assessment \nDJJ will attempt to contact family members, generally parents or legal guardians, within two \nbusiness days of the arrival of the youth in the reception center. For youth with a prior history of \nmental illness, or when intake screening suggests the presence of a mental illness, initial \ntelephone contact will be followed by a face-to-face or telephone interview conducted by a \nclinician or case manager to obtain relevant past family and psychiatric history to assist in the \ninitial mental health assessment. Staff will use standardized assessment measures to assess \nfamily background, strengths, and functioning. Where necessary and available, verbal consent \nfor treatment for youths under the age of 18 will be requested within two business days of arrival \nand written consent obtained within seven days. Contact information and clinical information \nfrom this assessment will be documented in the youth’s medical record.  \n \nTelephone contact between the youth and his/her family will be facilitated within 24 hours of \narrival at the reception center to assist the youth in the early adjustment to his/her confinement. \nOngoing telephone contact between the youth and family will be facilitated on a regular basis \nduring the entire period of the youth’s confinement. \n \nMany youth with mental illness have received mental health treatment in county detention \nfacilities. Communication with county treatment staff will enhance the intake and assessment \nprocess at DJJ. \n \n    Page 51 \n\n \nEngagement of Families \nStrong efforts will be made to maintain contact with and engage the youth’s family after \nplacement in the appropriate DJJ facility. One evidence based model for family engagement that \nmay be appropriate for the DJJ population is the Family Engagement Model developed by \nMcKay et al (McKay & Bannon, 2005). This engagement program involves a manualized \nprotocol that can be taught to intake teams to support strategies for engaging families in services. \nThis model incorporates techniques from motivational interviewing.  \n \nFor youth placed in intensive mental health treatment programs, when family members are \navailable and appropriate participants, family engagement will include a minimum of weekly \ncontact either in person or by telephone by a member of the youth’s treatment team. The goals of \nthese sessions are to: (1) update the family about the youth’s clinical progress, (2) obtain \ninformation about any changes in the youth’s family circumstances, (3) maintain regular contact \nbetween the youth and his/her family, (4) discuss plans for transition of the youth back to the \ncommunity after confinement, (5) educate the family about the ongoing treatment needs of their \nchild, and (6) solicit their support for his/her treatment. Details of these contacts will be \ndocumented in the youth’s record. Details of mental health and substance abuse/dependence \ntreatment will be protected under the guidelines of the state and federal statutes that govern \nconfidentiality and privilege of such information. Before any family sessions are initiated, staff \nwill obtain appropriate consents and waivers of confidentiality. For youth 18 years old and older, \nthe assigned staff person will first get permission from the youth to contact family, and will leave \nit to the youth’s discretion which family members will be contacted. In order to protect the \nconfidentiality of the youth, before a staff person speaks with a family member who is not \nlegally a parent or guardian for youth under 18, the staff person will obtain all legally-required \nwaivers of confidentiality. Likewise, before a staff person speaks with anyone (including \nparents) about youth 18 and older, the staff person will obtain all legally-required waivers of \nconfidentiality from the youth. \n \nIn cases where family members are not available or are not willing to be contacted by the \ntreatment team, efforts to solicit their involvement will be documented in the youth’s record. \n \nPursuant to California Family Code, Sections 6924(d), mental health treatment or counseling \nshall not involve the minor’s parent or guardian if, in the opinion of the mental health clinician, \nthe involvement would be inappropriate (i.e. deemed to be potentially harmful to the youth). \nAdditionally, youth age 18 and over may prohibit staff from contacting parents and guardians. \n \nThe Reform Implementation Team will explore the possibility of establishing a program of \n“parent partners” for possible implementation by local mental health and program staff at \nfacilities with Residential Mental Health Programs. This program, if found to be feasible, will \ninvolve establishing a network of parents of youth who have successfully participated in their \nchild’s treatment who will subsequently facilitate involvement of other parents. This model has \nbeen used extensively in mental health clinics and schools in many states, and has been found to \nprovide “peer to peer” support for families and to improve engagement, access, and satisfaction \nwith mental health services (Bickman & Heflinger, 1996; Hoagwood, 2005; McKay & Bannon, \n2005). Duties of “parent partners” might include accompanying parents to family visits, \nconferencing with facility staff, case management relevant to re-entry planning, and general \nsupport. This may be very pertinent to ensuring mental health follow-up in local communities. In \n    Page 52 \n\n \naddition, DJJ will explore the feasibility of organizing quarterly “Family Visiting Days” to \nencourage further participation of families in the child’s treatment. \n \nTransition to the Community \nWhile receiving such services in a facility is important to improving adaptive functioning, youths \nmay face difficulties in maintaining these gains when they are released. As they return to their \ncommunities they may face a variety of risks that challenge their skills to maintain sobriety and \navoid illegal behavior, including troubled family environments, exposure to friends or family \nmembers who use substances or engage in illegal behaviors, unstructured time, problems with \nschool or occupational performance, and lack of reinforcement for improved behavior. Research \nsupports the importance of providing support during this critical transition period (Trupin, et al; \n2004). \n \nOne model for assisting mentally ill youth with this transition is the Family Integrated \nTransitions (FIT) program. FIT provides integrated individual and family services to juvenile \noffenders with mental health and chemical dependency disorders during the period of transition \nof the youth from incarceration back to the community. The goals of the FIT program include \nlowering the risk for recidivism, connecting the family with appropriate community supports, \nachieving youth abstinence from alcohol and other drugs, improving the mental health status of \nthe youth, and increasing prosocial behavior. Engagement and retention of families in treatment \nby enhancing their motivation to change is a cornerstone of the FIT intervention. FIT relies \nheavily on the engagement techniques of Motivational Enhancement Therapy, an approach \ndeveloped by Miller and Rollnick (1991) to engage clients in treatment with the objective of \nincreasing their commitment to change. It is a focused and goal-directed approach with the \noverarching objective of helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence about change.  \n \nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the FIT program by the Washington State Institute for \nPublic Policy found that it reduced 18 month recidivism for the target population from 40.6 \npercent to 27 percent. While an expensive program, this reduction in crime saved taxpayers in \nWashington State $3.15 for every dollar invested in the program. Costs and savings in California \nmay differ based on California recidivism rates and the cost of processing and sanctioning \ncriminal offenses in California. \n \nAnother evidence based program for transition of youth to the community is the Family Justice \n(“La Bodega”) Model. This program is appropriate for youth in the core rehabilitation/treatment \nprogram. DJJ will implement the FIT Program for youth in mental health treatment programs, \nand the Family Justice Model Program for youth in core rehabilitation/treatment programs, on a \npilot basis. Based on outcome evaluation of these pilot programs, DJJ will expand them as \nappropriate.  \n \nMonitoring Treatment Effectiveness \nThe Health Care Services Remedial Plan includes provisions for monitoring service quality \nthrough performance indicators and a quality management process. Mental Health Services will \nparticipate in this process by, among other things, developing performance indicators to monitor \nthe quality of services and measure patient outcomes. DJJ will review the existing mental health \nmonitoring systems for youth to ensure that the proposed assessments in this program can be \n    Page 53 \n\n \nfeasibly incorporated into this process.14 DJJ will review the options with respect to their \ncompatibility with DJJ’s assessment protocols so as to ensure continued enhancement and \ndelivery of quality behavioral health treatments.  \n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  DJJ will develop and implement a system to document and track: (1) attempts to engage \nfamilies in their child’s treatment program, (2) family participation in their child’s treatment, \nand (3) family notification of suicide attempts, hospitalizations, movement to different levels \nof care, serious injuries, and serious offenses committed against the youth consistent with \nDJJ policies. This system will be in use not later than February 29, 2008. \n \n2.  DJJ will investigate the feasibility of using the Family Engagement Model, or other evidence \nbased models for family engagement it chooses to review, in its mental health programs. This \nfeasibility review will be completed by no later than May 15, 2007.  \n \n3.  If a Family Engagement Model, or other evidence based model for family engagement, is \nfound to be feasible and appropriate for DJJ’s population, an implementation plan will be \ndeveloped and the model will be implemented no later than July 31, 2008. \n \n4.  DJJ will investigate the feasibility of implementing a program of parent partners. This \nfeasibility review will be completed by no later than May 30, 2007.  \n \n5.  If a program of parent partners is found feasible and appropriate for DJJ’s population, an \nimplementation plan will be developed and DJJ will begin implementation no later than \nAugust 10, 2008.  \n \n6.  No later than May 30, 2007, DJJ will initiate a pilot using the Family Integrated Transition \nmodel for youth in its specialized mental health programs and the Family Justice (“La \n \nBodega”) model for youth in core treatment programs. \n \n7.  By February 2008, DJJ will complete a review of outcomes from the Family Integrated \n \nTransition model and the Family Justice model pilot programs. \n \n8.  If found feasible and appropriate for the DJJ population, DJJ will work with the Consent \nDecree experts to develop an implementation plan to continue the Family Integrated \n \nTreatment and Family Justice programs beyond the pilot phase no later than April 30, 2008.\n \n9.  No later than June 30, 2008, DJJ will provide a budget for acquisition of professional \njournals and publications at each facility. The Director of Mental Health Services/Chief \n \nPsychiatrist will oversee maintenance of the professional libraries.\n \n10. Effective immediately, DJJ will provide funding for ongoing training and attendance at \nnational and regional conferences for appropriate mental health staff.  \n                                                 \n14 Several mental health quality monitoring systems are currently available for youth with mental health problems. \nThe purpose of these systems is to provide a comprehensive picture of youth treatment progress. Two examples are \nthe University of Arkansas’ Outcomes Monitoring Project and the Peabody Treatment Progress Battery (Bickman, \n2005). \n    Page 54 \n\n \n \n11. DJJ will conduct an analysis of treatment intervention efficacy and of the treatment needs of \nits population either through use of an existing mental health monitoring system or by \ndeveloping its own by a date to be set in the Standards and Criteria section.  \n \n12. Based on the analysis treatment intervention efficacy and of the treatment needs of its \npopulation described in the previous action plan item, DJJ will modify its treatments and \nidentify and implement new training as required by a date to be set in the Standards and \nCriteria section. \n \n    Page 55 \n\n \nSection 7 \nSTAFF QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING \n \nTHE ISSUE \nBecause the Mental Health and Safety and Welfare Remedial Plans will not succeed in the \nabsence of qualified mental health providers, DJJ must be able to attract and retain competent \nprofessionals. For existing staff and new hires, initial and ongoing training is needed to develop \nand maintain the skills required for implementation and maintenance of effective mental health \nprograms. \n \nDISCUSSION \nCompensation \nMental health care providers employed by the Division of Juvenile Justice will have pay parity \nwith mental health care staff employed by Adult Operations and Adult Programs. Pay \ndifferentials may be used to aid in recruitment and retention to specific facilities or regions. \n \nDJJ is committed to making all efforts to fully staff all mental health positions as expeditiously \nas possible to ensure its mental health programs comply with this Remedial Plan. This may \ninclude reviewing the levels of compensation, when appropriate, and developing recruitment and \nretention strategies consistent with state policy. DJJ Mental Health Services will work with the \nCDCR Office of Workforce Planning to arrange participation in mental health job fairs at DJJ \nfacilities and recruitment events at professional schools and/or conferences. DJJ will also pursue \nadditional strategies, such as improving working conditions to make employment with DJJ more \nattractive to qualified mental health providers and/or by developing new, or modify existing, job \nclassifications. \n \nDepartment of Personnel Administration Salary Survey Findings \nIn April 2006, the Department of Personnel Administration published preliminary findings from \nthe state’s first comprehensive survey of compensation in more than 20 years. This survey \ncompared total compensation for state workers to that paid to private sector and other public \nsector employees who work in the same, or similar, job classifications. The survey of private \nsector employers is based on average total compensation in 2005. The survey of other public \nsector employers is based on average total compensation as of January 2006. \n \nThere were insufficient data from the survey of private sector employers for most mental health \nprofessions. However, the survey found that average total compensation for master’s level social \nworkers employed by the state is 76.4 percent of what the average social worker in the private \nsector earns. \n \nSufficient data were available to compare state employees with other public sector employees for \npsychiatrists, psychologists, and master’s level social workers. The results of the survey are \nshown in Table 7.1.  \n \n    Page 56 \n\n \nTable 7.1: Total Compensation for State Employees  \n% of Median Total Compensation for Employees of Other Public Agencies \n \nState Compensation as % of  \nJob  Other Public Agency Compensation \nClassification  Starting  Maximum \nPsychiatrists  78.7%  71.3% \nPsychologists  87.3%  81.7% \nSocial Workers  73.7%  81.3% \n \nNote that, for the one job classification where the comparison can be made, social workers in \nother public agencies earn about the same as their counterparts in the private sector.15 \n \nPlaintiff reserves her right to invoke the dispute resolution mechanisms under the Consent \nDecree at any time, but she may wait and see whether the problems of recruitment and retention \nof qualified mental health providers are resolved as part of the CDCR Adult Operations and \nAdult Programs federal lawsuit, Coleman v. Schwarzenegger. \n \nStaff Qualifications and Licensure \nPsychiatrists \nAll psychiatrists hired by DJJ after the filing of this plan are to be licensed to practice medicine \nin the State of California and be board certified or board eligible, in accordance with the \nAmerican Board of Medical Specialties, preferably in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Forensic \nPsychiatry, and/or General Psychiatry. Psychiatrists should have awareness and understanding of \nthe operations of the juvenile correctional facility and the issues affecting it, including its \ninterface with multiple systems (e.g. courts, probation, parole, social services, and child welfare \nagencies), the existing educational and health care systems within the facility, evidence based \ntreatments, and expertise in using a wide array of psychopharmacologic interventions with this \npopulation. \n \nPsychologists \nAll non-entry level psychologists hired by DJJ after the filing of this plan are to be licensed \nclinicians in the State of California. Entry level psychologists hired by DJJ after the filing of this \nplan must be license eligible and must receive their license within two years of employment with \nDJJ. Psychologists are expected to be well versed in cognitive behavioral treatment theory and \npractice either through prior education and experience or through additional training. They \nshould be adept at teaching, coaching, and demonstrating cognitive behavioral treatment skills to \nnon-clinical staff who will deliver most CBT services. Clinicians should have awareness and \nunderstanding of the operations of the juvenile correctional facility and the issues affecting it, \nincluding its interface with multiple systems (e.g. courts, probation, parole, social services, and \nchild welfare agencies) and the existing educational and health care systems within the facility. \n \n                                                 \n15 Social workers employed by the state earn 76 percent of what social workers in the private sector make. Social \nworkers employed by the state earn 76 to 81 percent of what social workers in other public agencies make. (A = \n.76B; A ≈ .76C; therefore B ≈ C) \n    Page 57 \n\n \nInterns \nPsychology Interns must be pre-doctoral candidates from an accredited university. Master’s level \ngraduate students may also be used as field placement students or trainees. \n \nTreatment Team Leader \nThe role of the treatment team leader will be defined through the process of developing the \nIntegrated Behavioral Treatment Model. For a general discussion of this function, refer to \nSection 3 of this plan. \n \nYouth Correctional Counselor – IBTM \nUnder the Integrated Behavior Treatment Model, Youth Correctional Counselors will provide \nmany of the skills training, shaping, contingency management, cognitive restructuring, coaching \nand role playing, etc. that constitute the interventions used in the treatment model. Therefore, at a \nminimum, as DJJ continues to hire Youth Correctional Counselors, in the future, preference will \nbe given to applicants who have a Bachelor’s Degree or higher and/or who have significant \nprofessional experience in casework, counseling, probation and parole, social services or a \nrelated field. To be eligible to work in a living unit operating under this treatment model, a \nYouth Correctional Counselor must successfully complete IBTM training as required by DJJ. \n \nTraining \nDJJ will develop training, write curriculum, provide training for trainers, and implement training \nof mental and behavioral health staff. DJJ will develop a training plan and schedule consistent \nwith the sample training strategy described below and illustrated in Figure 7.1. \n \nFigure 7.1: Training in Evidence Based Treatment \n \nPhase I Phase II Phase III\nTraining in the Integrated\nBehavioral Treatment Model\nSpecialized training for\nDissemination of specialized\nselected clinicians: high\ntraining to clinicians in all\nfrequency diagnoses and\nintensive treatment programs\nmaladaptive behaviors\nAssessment of treatment\nefficacy, reassessment of\nneeds, and and modification\nof treatments as necessary\n \n \nPsychologists who provide consulting and coaching to direct care staff in the Integrated Behavior \nTreatment Model receive in-depth training in the model. They will meet monthly on a regional \nbasis, and quarterly on a state-wide basis, to share experiences and insights and to reinforce \nexisting skills and receive training in new skills. \n \n    Page 58 \n\n \nAs described in the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan, direct care staff receive training in all \naspects of the Integrated Behavior Treatment Model, including in-depth instruction in the skill \nsets used. Managers and support staff also receive training as described in the Safety and Welfare \nRemedial Plan. \n \nAll training in standardized modules will be competency based. \n \nPhase I Training \nThe first training phase has three parts. First, selected staff, including clinical psychologists, will \nreceive in-depth training in cognitive behavioral treatment theory and practice and in the \nelements and skill sets used in the DJJ Integrated Behavior Treatment Model. This training will \nbe provided by consultants with documented expertise in the Integrated Behavior Treatment \nModel. These staff will become the primary trainers of non-clinical staff in the treatment model. \nSecond, psychiatrists and psychologists will receive in-depth training in evidence based \ntreatments for high frequency disorders found in the DJJ population. Third, in coordination with \nthe implementation schedule for opening new living units and increasing staffing levels on \nexisting units, all staff having contact with youth will receive training in the Integrated Behavior \nTreatment Model. \n \nResidential unit direct care staff will receive training in: \n \n•  Cognitive-behavioral treatment overview \n•  Behavior modification components \n•  Interactive behavioral analysis \n•  Treatment hierarchy \n•  Treatment planning \n•  Motivational interviewing \n•  In-depth overview of skill set \n•  IBTM documentation \n \nManagers will receive training in all of the areas listed. Training for managers will include \ncomponents specifically directed toward administrative implementation of the treatment model. \n \nSupport staff will receive training to include to a brief cognitive-behavioral overview and \ninformation on treatment planning and IBTM documentation. \n \nPhase II Training \nPhase II training will consist of wider dissemination of specialized evidence based treatment \nskills learned and practiced by clinical psychologists in the first phase of training. Phase II will \nalso involve continued training of staff in the DJJ Integrated Behavior Treatment Model as \nadditional facilities and living units are converted to the treatment model. \n \nPsychiatrists and psychologists will receive additional training to acquire and practice new skills \nin evidence based treatments for additional disorders frequently found in the DJJ population. \n \n \n \n \n    Page 59 \n\n \nPhase III Training \nPhase III training will expand specialized evidence based treatments throughout the entire DJJ \nsystem and complete the initial training of staff in the Integrated Behavior Treatment Model as \nthe last living units are brought on line.  \n \nOn-unit Coaching \nClinical psychologists and other qualified mental health trainers will provide guidance to direct \ncare staff through consulting, coaching, and demonstrating treatment approaches and techniques. \nClinical psychologists will be in the living units working with direct care staff for a substantial \npart of every working day.  \n \nLearning from Peers \nRegular sharing of experiences, insights, and new knowledge among peers is an effective way to \nincrease skills and promote fidelity to the treatment model. Selected treatment team members \nwill meet together monthly with a consulting clinician or trainer from central office, another \nfacility, an on-site expert, or an outside consultant for purposes of problem solving, sharing \nexperiences with youth, and discussing IBTM issues and developments.  \n \nOngoing Training \nUnder the IBTM, all staff who interact with youth are “treatment providers.” As such, all staff \nmust develop and maintain appropriate skills. In addition, as the IBTM is used, modifications \nand additions will be made to the model which will require additional training. To meet these \nneeds, DJJ will develop a plan for ongoing training. \n \nContinuing Medical Education \nContinuing medical education will be provided as described in the Health Care Services \nRemedial Plan. \n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  Immediately on the filing of this plan, DJJ will ensure that mental health care providers \nemployed by the Division of Juvenile Justice have pay parity with comparable staff \nemployed by CDCR adult operations. DJJ will also ensure that pay differentials are used as \nappropriate to aid in recruitment and retention of mental health staff for specific facilities or \nregions. \n \n2.  Immediately on the filing of this plan, DJJ Mental Health Services will work with the CDCR \nOffice of Workforce Planning to arrange participation in mental health job fairs at DJJ \nfacilities and recruitment events at professional schools and/or conferences.  \n \n3.  Immediately on the filing of this plan, DJJ will begin to participate in mental health job fairs \nand recruitment events.  \n \n4.  DJJ will implement training in the Integrated Behavior Treatment Model as described in the \nSafety and Welfare Remedial Plan.  \n \n5.  By a date to be specified in the Standards and Criteria section, DJJ will establish a schedule \nfor training staff based on the timeframes by which various components of the Integrated \n    Page 60 \n\n \nBehavioral Treatment Model are developed, including evidence based treatment for \nidentified high frequency diagnoses and maladaptive behaviors.  \n \n6.  As applicable to each clinician, DJJ will provide instruction in the evidence based \ninterventions for high frequency diagnoses and maladaptive behaviors identified above to all \nmental health clinicians in intensive treatment programs by July 15, 2009. \n \n    Page 61 \n\n \nSection 8 \nPOLICIES AND PROCEDURES \n \nTHE ISSUE \nIn all aspects of system reform, DJJ is moving toward being a policy driven organization. \nPolicies and procedures not only define operations and systems of accountability, they also \npromote standardization. As a rehabilitative organization dedicated to improved outcomes \nthrough use of evidence based practices, policies and procedures help shape and standardize \npractices in furtherance of that objective. \n \nDISCUSSION \nGeneral Mental Health Policies and Procedures \nDJJ will provide mental health care services at its facilities according to standard policies and \nprocedures which will be used statewide to provide an appropriate level of care and treatment by \nappropriately credentialed health care professionals.  \n \nThe previously filed Health Care Services Remedial Plan provides for the development and \nimplementation of health care policies, procedures and protocols. The provisions of the Health \nCare Services Remedial Plan concerning the requirements for policies, procedures and protocols \npertain equally to mental health. The Mental Health Services Director/Chief Psychiatrist will \nensure that the requirements for policies, procedures and protocols are met with respect to mental \nhealth care.  \n \nDJJ’s policies and procedures will be standardized and focused on the integration of mental \nhealth services and will clearly define the roles and responsibilities of professionals who \nimplement them. As stated in the Health Care Service Remedial Plan, policies drive the \nidentification of required resources and the evaluation of outcomes. They also play an essential \nrole in the success of Quality Management and/or Peer Review programs. \n \nDJJ will develop a complete set of essential policies and procedures both to form the basis of the \ndelivery of services and to address the deficiencies identified in the expert’s report. As with \nhealth care services, all policies related to mental health services will be referenced to standards \ncontained in the current edition of Standards for Health Services in Juvenile Detention and \nConfinement Facilities, the current edition of Correctional Mental Health Care Standards & \nGuidelines for Delivering Services, current recommendations regarding mental disorders from \nthe US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), Practice Parameters published by the \nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Practice Guidelines published by \nthe American Psychiatric Association.  \n \nDJJ will work closely with mental health subject matter experts to develop policies and \nprocedures. Policies and procedures will be based on the guiding principles and key concepts \nidentified in this plan. \n \nDJJ will develop policies and procedures that cover the following mental health care issues: \n \n1.  Integrated screening and assessments. \n2.  Process for identification of mental health issues in youth. \n    Page 62 \n\n \n3.  Initial risk assessments. \n4.  Psychiatric and psychological evaluations. \n5.  Integrated and evidence based mental health treatment services (such as Cognitive \nBehavioral Therapy, Motivational Interviewing and Enhancement Skills, Dialectical \nBehavior Therapy, etc.). \n6.  Individualized treatment planning. \n7.  Mental health referral process. \n8.  Mental health level of care system. \n9.  Mental health program guides. \n10. Standards for family involvement in assessment, treatment and transition. \n11. Standards for family notification of suicide attempts, hospitalizations, movement to \ndifferent levels of care, serious injuries, and serious offenses committed against the \nyouth, including documentation requirements. \n12. Standards for protecting and granting access to confidential information. \n13. Suicide Prevention Assessment and Response Policy. \n14. Seclusion and Clinically-indicated Restraint Policy. \n15. Discharge, aftercare and transition planning. \n16. Guidelines for documentation, report writing, etc. \n17. Guidelines for movement between levels of care. \n18. Mental health concerns in use of force, Disciplinary Decision Making System (DDMS), \ngrievances, etc. \n19. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. \n20. Psychopharmacological treatment. \n21. Informed Consent for Psychotropic Medications. \n22. Psychiatric Referrals and Crisis Response.  \n \nMental health policies and procedures may be revised on the same terms as other health care \npolicies under the Health Care Services Remedial Plan. \n \nPharmacy Services / Medication Administration Policies and Procedures \nThe previously filed Health Care Services Remedial Plan provides for policy and procedure with \nregard to pharmacy services and medication administration. The requirements specified therein \nwill also apply to mental health services.  \n \nPsychopharmacological treatment is one of the core mental health interventions for a wide range \nof diagnoses in psychiatry. Effective treatment for this highly morbid population must include \nexpertise and familiarity with up-to-date principles of medication management that align with \ncommunity standards of care. It is also important that DJJ physicians have an informed \nknowledge about the appropriate uses of such medications so that they are not used \nindiscriminately or without sound clinical indications. All medication treatment will include \nstandard procedures with respect to the need to obtain informed consent.  \n \nDJJ will develop Policies, Procedures, and Guidelines regarding the use of psychotropic \nmedications. DJJ policy on medication administration will incorporate the following principles:  \n \n1.  Establish guidelines for specific and appropriate target symptoms that are amenable to \ntreatment with psychotropic medications. \n    Page 63 \n\n \n2.  Use suitable standardized assessment techniques which are conducted at baseline prior to \ntreatment and at standardized follow up intervals. \n3.  Assign a principal diagnosis wherever possible that most accurately represents the \ndisorder that is causing the problematic target symptom. \n4.  Obtain appropriate baseline and follow up laboratory tests including blood tests and \nEKGs prior to and after starting psychotropic medication treatment. \n5.  Start with single agent treatment wherever possible with medications that target specific \nsymptoms so as to limit potential side effects and allow appropriate monitoring and \ninterpretation of treatment response. \n6.  Titrate medications to the adequate and optimal dose, using laboratory tests where \nmedically indicated for monitoring and allow sufficient time (often weeks to months) to \nassess treatment response prior to initiating further changes in the medication regimen.  \n7.  Consider combination and augmentation treatment only after reasonable certainty that the \nprimary agent is ineffective and after having re-considered the principal diagnosis. \n8.  Polypharmacy will be avoided whenever clinically appropriate. \n9.  Monitor treatment response and side effects using appropriate measures of target \nsymptoms and assessments of global functioning, such as the Clinical Global Impression \n(CGI). \n10. Provide guidance on appropriate protocols to discontinue medications to minimize the \nrisk of withdrawal symptoms or re-emergence of symptoms. \n11. Review prior treatment history and records especially in regard to efficacy. \n12. Review documented history of abuse of both illicit and prescribed medications. \n \nModification of General DJJ Policy for Mentally Ill Youth \nIn addition to specific policies for mental health services, general DJJ policies that relate to all \nyouth will require modification or additions in their application to mentally ill youth. \nModifications will be needed in DJJ policy on the use of force, use of restraints, and the \ndisciplinary process. \n \nUse of Force \nPolicies and procedures relating to the use of force will include sections on mentally ill youth. \nPolicy will recognize that: \n \n1.  Because of potential medical complications, in any controlled use of force, oleoresin \ncapsicum spray (OC - also known as pepper spray or mace) is not to be used on youth \nwho are on psychotropic agents.16 In addition, some individuals who are very aggressive, \nagitated, intoxicated, or suffer from a severe mental illness may have altered perceptions \nand responses to pain and therefore may not respond as desired and may become more \nagitated by exposure. \n2.  If at all possible, controlled use of force (i.e. use of force not requiring immediate action) \nwill include the presence of mental health personnel if the youth is on a mental health \ncaseload. In addition, all controlled use of force is to be proceeded by a cooling down \nperiod to allow the youth to voluntarily comply with staff instructions.  \n3.  The Institutional Force Review Committee is to include a representative from mental \nhealth when a use of force incident on a mentally ill youth is reviewed. \n                                                 \n16 See Safety and Welfare Plan for definition of “Controlled Use of Force.” \n    Page 64 \n\n \n \nPolicy regarding accommodations in the use of force for mentally ill youth will be developed in \nconsultation with the Chief Psychiatrist and outside experts. The Medical Director and/or Chief \nPsychiatrist for DJJ will develop a policy/procedure outlining a process of communication and \ndocumentation to ensure that healthcare and/or mental health professionals indicate if any use of \nforce is not appropriate for a specific youth. This information will be provided to the unit staff \nand Duty Lieutenant who will be responsible for obtaining this information prior to a controlled \nuse of force.  \n \nUse of Clinically Indicated Restraints \nClinically-indicated restraints will only be used in a licensed facility (or transportation to a \nlicensed facility).  \n \nDJJ will develop policies and procedures to ensure that: \n \n1.  Clinically indicated restraints are only applied when all less restrictive interventions have \nbeen exhausted. \n2.  Health-trained personnel or medical service staff examine the youth every 15 minutes to \ndetermine any loss of integrity of skin, nerves, and circulation. This must also be \nappropriately documented. \n3.  All precautions are taken to insure that restraints do not jeopardize the health of the youth \nand all ongoing medically necessary treatment is administered. \n4.  Restraints are applied, if at all possible, when the youth is in a supine position.  \n5.  Hog-tying is forbidden. \n \nDivision policy will address the following issues with regard to the use of clinically indicated \nrestraints on mentally ill youth: \n \n1.  The types of restraints that may be used. \n2.  When mechanical restraints may be used, including the conditions necessitating their use \nand the requirements for the approval for their use. \n3.  The specific location where they may be employed. \n4.  Who may apply restraints and for how long restraints may be used. \n5.  Required documentation on standardized forms and using a format that is consistent with \nquality assurance standards. \n6.  A requirement to report any use of therapeutic restraint of a youth as a serious incident. \nThe policy will specify that all documentation of the use of therapeutic restraint be \nsubject to audit annually and be subject to inclusion in medical quality assurance reviews. \n7.  Documentation of the initial and ongoing training in the use and policies governing \nrestraints. \n \nAdministration of medication that is medically indicated for certain mental disorders or severe \nagitation may diminish the need for restraints. DJJ will develop guidelines for medically \nappropriate use of psychopharmacological agents in youth who pose an imminent danger to self \nor others. \n \n    Page 65 \n\n \nDisciplinary Process and Mentally Ill Youth \nAs discussed in Section 5, policies and procedures relating to the disciplinary process will \ninclude sections on mentally ill youth that recognize that there are mental disorders and some \nside effects from psychotropic agents which include symptoms or behaviors that, on the surface, \nmay constitute violations of the code of conduct. Special attention must be given to these \nbecause a disciplinary measure may not be warranted and may, in fact, be harmful in such \ninstances. Policy will require that all unit staff, especially those responsible for imposing \ndisciplinary measures, be trained in mental health and the side effects of psychotropic agents. \n \nThe disciplinary hearing committee considering allegations of misconduct involving a youth on a \nmental health caseload must include someone from mental health as described in Section 5, \nsubsection, “Forensic Services.”  \n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  In consultation with Consent Decree mental health experts, DJJ will develop a \ncomprehensive set of essential policies and procedures for the delivery mental health services \nas described in this section. DJJ will provide plaintiff’s counsel and the Special Master with \ncopies of proposed policies and procedures for their review and comment prior to adoption. \nUpdated mental health polices and procedures will be completed by a date to be specified in \nthe Standards and Criteria section. Policy and procedure pertaining to \npsychopharmacological services will be coordinated with policy development consistent with \nthe Health Care Services Remedial Plan. \n \n2.  In consultation with Consent Decree mental health experts, DJJ will develop policies \nregarding mentally ill youth and the use of force, use of restraints, and the disciplinary \nprocess. These policies will be consistent with the descriptions in this section. DJJ will \nprovide plaintiff’s counsel and the Special Master with copies of proposed modifications to \nthese policies and procedures for their review and comment prior to adoption. These \nmodifications will be completed by December 31, 2006. \n    Page 66 \n\n \nSection 9 \nMENTAL HEALTH RECORDS \n \nTHE ISSUE \nThrough the Health Care Services Remedial Plan, DJJ will use a Unified Health Record. Mental \nhealth records must be compatible with, or incorporated within, the Unified Health Record. \nTreatment records must be accessible to the appropriate staff in a timely matter. \n \nDISCUSSION \nAs described in the Health Care Services Remedial Plan, DJJ will have a Unified Health Record \nthat contains all past and current documentation regarding the youth’s medical and mental health \ntreatment. This document will be immediately available to all health care staff who provide \nclinical care to the individual. There will be clear guidelines regarding the format and nature of \ndocumentation that is required for specific clinical services with appropriate audits to monitor \ncompliance. There will be a mechanism to ensure that the record follows the youth as he/she is \ntransferred to different facilities within DJJ, for example, from the Reception Center to the \ntreatment facility. There will also be a mechanism to ensure that the medical and mental health \nrecords of youth who are admitted directly to a treatment facility (e.g. parole violators) are \navailable at the treatment facility in a timely manner.  \n \nAs also described in the Health Care Services Remedial Plan, DJJ will ultimately have a \ncomputerized medical record base that provides system-wide access to the medical record so that \nimportant clinical data is available at any facility in which a youth is placed for treatment. This \nrecord will have the capacity to allow restricted access to confidential sections of the medical \nrecord to staff who are authorized for such access. This record may be based on the current WIN \nsystem, or may be based on a separate system with greater capacity for functions such as \nscanning of medical and legal documents. DJJ will also explore the use of transcription services \nso that details of all clinical contacts can be transcribed directly into the medical record.  \n \nDJJ will review its current records systems in which multiple medical and treatment records exist \nat different locations. Problems related to redundancy and lack of access to clinical/treatment \ninformation based on the physical locations of the different records will be addressed. DJJ will \nidentify or develop the appropriate computerized record system to address these problems and \nmeet its needs.  \n \nLaws regarding confidentiality and protection of confidential and protected information will be \nfollowed in all matters related to the medical record. This is particularly important with regard to \nsensitive mental health information and history. Protocols will be put in place to restrict access to \nhealth care records within the facility. When privileged information is disclosed to non-\nhealthcare staff, disclosure must be in compliance with state and federal law. Policies regarding \nthe release of information to outside facilities and policies regarding the need to obtain informed \nconsent from a youth or his/her parents or legal guardians will be periodically reviewed and \nrevised when appropriate. \n \n    Page 67 \n\n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  By a date to be set in the Standards and Criteria section, DJJ will review the current records \nsystems to address problems related to redundancy and lack of access to clinical/treatment \ninformation.  \n \n2.  By a date to be set in the Standards and Criteria section, DJJ will identify or develop an \nappropriate computerized record system to address problems of redundancy and lack of \naccess identified in the previous action plan item. \n \n3.  Other actions pertaining to mental health records will be taken in conjunction with the Health \nCare Services Remedial Plan and be governed by that plan. \n \n \n \n    Page 68 \n\n \nSection 10 \nQUALITY MANAGEMENT AND PEER REVIEW \n \nTHE ISSUE \nSystems to ensure the quality and integrity of mental health care are essential to the \nsuccess of this Remedial Plan.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nQuality Management Committees and Process \nThe Health Care Services Remedial Plan identifies the components of quality management and \npeer review programs for DJJ. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that all health care \ndelivery, including mental health, is consistent with national standards and DJJ Health Care \npolicies and procedures. Overall responsibility for the quality management programs lies with \nthe Medical Director. \n \nEach facility is to have a Quality Management Committee (QMC) consisting of, at a minimum, \nthe facility Chief Medical Officer, Psychiatrist, Psychologist, Administrator, Supervising Nurse, \nDentist, Pharmacist, and any ad hoc members as deemed necessary. Custody Staff and/or other \ndesignees of the superintendent may, by invitation, participate in meetings of the Quality \nManagement Committee with appropriate safeguards in place to protect confidential information. \nThe purpose of these meetings is to coordinate care, discuss administrative and clinical issues, \nand to take necessary corrective action. Recommendations for correction action are to be based \non clinical outcomes measured by data collected from clinical indicators. The process for \nidentifying clinical indicators is outlined in the Health Care Services Remedial Plan. \n \nEach Quality Management Committee has various subcommittees, including a Mental Health \nSubcommittee. This committee is chaired by a psychiatrist or senior psychologist. It meets bi-\nmonthly to review: \n \n1.  All Special Incident Reports involving youth on the mental health caseload. \n2.  Use of clinical restraints. \n3.  Emergency Use of psychotropic medications. \n4.  Data gathered through the quality management program local audits. \n \nThe primary assignment of this subcommittee is to identify quality of care problem areas and \nmakes recommendations to the Medical Director regarding change in practices that will lead to \nimprovement of patient outcomes. \n \nAn external quality management process is conducted by a Quality Management Team from \ncentral office. \n \nThe Health Care Services Remedial Plan also includes requirements and processes for physician \npeer review and for protecting the confidentiality of certain quality management system \ninformation. Peer review is to include psychologists. \n \n    Page 69 \n\n \nInternal Audits and Corrective Action Plans17 \nDJJ will develop internal audit instruments for its quality management program to be completed \nby Health Care Services administration and the Chief Medical Officer of each facility. On a \nquarterly basis, mental health (and related medical) audit instruments will be completed \naccording to identified priority. \n \nThe mental health experts consulted during the development of this Plan suggested the following \nlist of areas for auditing of operations and care. DJJ will develop its own audit system consistent \nwith the intent expressed by this list. \n \n1.  Documentation: medical records review \n2.  Medicine administration record review \n3.  Outpatient living unit care \n4.  Reception center assessment \n5.  Continuity of care for youth transferred between facilities \n6.  Restraints \n7.  Mental health treatment of seriously mentally ill youth \n8.  Seriously mentally ill youth in segregation \n9.  Discharged seriously mentally ill youth \n10. Transfer of seriously mentally ill youth \n11. Use of psychotropic drugs (specific audits for identified medication) \n12. Serious incident reports of mentally ill youth \n13. Training summary \n14. Child abuse reporting and investigations \n15. Treatment plan development \n16. Mental health assessment protocols \n17. Suicide and self injurious behavior statistics \n18. Family involvement \n19. Community transition plans \n20. Compliance with acceptance and rejection criteria \n \nThe results of the audits will be presented for corrective action to each facility Quality \nManagement Committee and, when applicable, to the appropriate subcommittee as identified in \nthe Health Care Services Remedial Plan.  \n \nThe facility Quality Management Team will develop Corrective Action Plans for each area that \ndid not reach the target threshold level. Development of corrective action plans will involve any \nfacility staff that the committee feels may be necessary to create a viable plan. The plan will \ninclude an implementation section so that a review can assess how the corrective action plan will \nbe applied. A repeat audit will be conducted of the area in the next quarter or, in cases where the \nplan may take longer to implement, six months later. The appropriate Quality Management \nCommittee will again analyze the results of the audit and, if necessary, devise another corrective \naction plan. These reports of corrective action plans will be filed in a Quality Management file at \nthe facility and sent to Health Care Services for review and retention in the facility’s Quality \n                                                 \n17 The phrase “Internal Audits” is used to distinguish ongoing quality management by DJJ from audits conducted for \ncompliance purposes as part of this Remedial Plan. \n    Page 70 \n\n \nManagement file. The Health Care Services may provide additional expertise to local facilities as \nneeded to enhance corrective action plans.  \n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  DJJ will develop an internal audit system for mental health services consistent with the \nHealth Care Services quality management and peer review program and with the \nrecommendations of the experts consulted in the development of this Remedial Plan. This \naudit system will be in place by a date to be specified in the Standards and Criteria section. \n \n2.  All other actions relative to implementation of a quality management and peer review system \nwill be taken in conjunction with the Health Care Services Remedial Plan and be governed \nby that plan. \n    Page 71 \n\n \nSection 11 \nFACILITIES \n \nTHE ISSUE \nThe Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan noted that none of DJJ’s existing facilities meets the \nlong-term programmatic needs set forth in the Safety and Welfare Plan and that, with the \nexception of Chaderjian, all of DJJ’s facilities have long exceeded their useful life. Because of \ntheir size, insufficient space for treatment programs and mental health staff, and generally non-\ntherapeutic environments, DJJ’s facilities also do not meet the programmatic needs set forth in \nthis Mental Health Remedial Plan. \n \nDISCUSSION \nBecause of the time it takes to plan and construct new facilities, DJJ will continue to use existing \nfacilities for a number of years. Consequently, this Remedial Plan needs to take into account \nshort-term plans for existing facilities as well as long-term plans for replacement facilities. \n \nExisting Facilities and Short Term Plans \nAdequate Space for Mental Health Programs and Staff \nBased on its November 30, 2005 draft Safety and Welfare and Mental Health Plans, DJJ \nrequested and received funding from the legislature to begin renovations to existing buildings \nand add modulars to meet the interim needs described in those plans. DJJ’s request was based on \nan evaluation of current resources and an estimate of the number of staff needing offices and the \nnumber of treatment spaces required for each type of unit. \n \nBased on existing building and site considerations, additional office and/or program space will \nbe added by converting vacated rooms or by adding modular buildings adjacent to, or near, the \nliving units as needed. The intention is to provide sufficient treatment rooms and offices so that \nsmall groups and private one-on-one counseling can take place consistent with the requirement \nset forth in this plan to maximize out of room time and to ensure structured activity based on \nevidence based principles for 40 to 70 percent of waking hours. However, while the addition of \nmodular space will improve conditions for youth and staff, the experts consulted in drafting this \nplan believe that new facilities are required to meet the programmatic requirements identified in \nthis plan. \n \nAs an interim measure, DJJ will consolidate most mental health programs for Northern \nCalifornia at the N. A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Center. Each mental health living unit will \nhave the population capacity and staffing as described in Section 5 of this Plan. \n \nLong-Term Needs and Plans \nJuvenile Justice Operational Master Plan \nThe long-term needs of mentally ill youth in DJJ facilities may also be affected by the Juvenile \nJustice Operational Master Plan described in the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan. Among \nother things, this plan may lead to alternative strategies for dealing with some of the youth \nhistorically committed to DJJ. Since the prevalence of mental illness is so high in the committed \npopulation, any alternative strategy must also address mental health issues. \n \n    Page 72 \n\n \nFacilities Master Plan \nThe Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan also calls for a Facilities Master Plan. The Facilities \nMaster Plan will, among other things, result in a systematic description and quantification of \nfuture facility needs based on a projection of future demand, demographics, projected program \nneeds, and the geographical distribution of commitments. The Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan \nnotes that living units for special populations will be smaller than the core rehabilitation/ \ntreatment living units and that living unit size will guided by national standards for juvenile \ncorrectional facilities and, if standards are not available, by the recommendations of national \nexperts. \n \nReplacement Facilities \nWhile specific requirements for residential mental health programs will be developed through the \nnormal capital development process, there are certain basic requirements that will affect the \ndesign of new buildings. For example, each facility must provide a safe and secure environment \nto house youth. In addition, to facilitate the implementation of effective mental health treatment, \nfacilities must provide a secure and private setting for treatment and an adequate number of \nmental health treatment rooms for individual, family and group psychotherapy.  \n \nInformation Technology \nTo facilitate the implementation of mental health services, facilities should provide computer and \ncommunication systems initially equipped with state-of-the-art equipment which is adequately \nmaintained. These systems should include a dedicated phone line with speakerphone, personal \ncomputer, internet access, and personal e-mail account for each mental health professional. Each \ntreatment unit should have a dedicated facsimile line and equipment and capacity to print \ndocuments. Each facility should have appropriate information technology support for staff. \nTreatment units should also provide equipment for educational purposes, including rooms with \nvideotape/CD/DVD and television monitors, and projection screens. \n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  DJJ will develop an implementation plan for creating offices and mental health treatment \nrooms using renovations and modular buildings as described in this section. This \nimplementation plan will identify locations and schedules for addressing deficiencies in this \narea. Deficiencies will be remedied in as expeditious a manner as possible. This \nimplementation plan will be completed no later than January 31, 2007. Remodels and \ninstallation of modular facilities will follow the schedules developed in the implementation \nplan. \n \n2.  DJJ will ensure that mental health issues are taken into account in the Juvenile Justice \nOperational Master Plan and Facilities Master Plan on the schedule set forth in the Safety and \nWelfare Remedial Plan. \n \n3.  DJJ will ensure that planning for new mental health facilities is done in conformance with the \nprinciples outlined in this section. These plans will be implemented in accordance with the \nschedule developed as part of the Facilities Master Plan. \n \n    Page 73 \n\n \n4.  DJJ will develop a plan for providing appropriate technology for residential mental health \nprograms and staff as described in this section. This plan will be completed no later than \nJanuary 15, 2008. DJJ will request funding as necessary and begin implementation at the \nbeginning of the fiscal year for which funds are appropriated. \n \nAll other actions described in this section, including maintaining physical plant conditions, \ndeveloping and implementing acceptance/rejection criteria, and juvenile justice and facilities \nmaster planning, will be implemented as described in the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan.\n    Page 74 \n\n \nSection 12 \nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN \n \nTHE ISSUE \nThis Remedial Plan requires many changes and additions to mental health services, systems, \nprocedures and protocols in DJJ facilities. In order to implement this Plan, DJJ must create the \ncapacity to change its mental health system. In order to ensure compliance with this Plan, \nstandards and criteria, audit instruments, and performance schedules must be developed. \n \nDISCUSSION \nCreate the Capacity for Change \nAs emphasized in the Safety and Welfare Plan, implementation of reform requires that DJJ \ndevelop the capacity to change through enhanced staffing and improved organizational structure \nboth at central office and at its facilities. This is no less true for the Mental Health Remedial Plan \nthan it is for the Safety and Welfare Plan.  \n \nThe Mental Health Remedial Plan introduces and/or modifies a significant number of new \nmental health policies, procedures, programming activities, screening and assessment protocols, \ntraining, automation systems, staffing levels, etc. Implementation of the Mental Health Remedial \nPlan will require staff resources over and above those needed for day-to-day management of the \nreformed mental health system. These staff are needed for at least three years for development of \npolicies and procedures, development of training curriculum, working with IT staff, helping with \nimplementation of new assessment protocols, and taking other action steps related to \nimplementation of this Plan. To this end, DJJ will establish a multidisciplinary reform \nimplementation team which will include at least four positions with clinical and/or administrative \nexpertise in the area of mental health services. The mental health experts on this team will be \nsenior clinicians and/or senior administrators who will be supported, along with other members \nof the reform implementation team, by a group of analysts and support staff as described in the \nSafety and Welfare Remedial Plan. \n \nImplementation of the Mental Health Remedial Plan will also include assistance by outside \nconsultants and development of a dedicated mental health training team consisting of at least \nthree licensed clinicians plus an instructional designer and office technician. \n \nOverall coordination and oversight of implementation of the Mental Health Remedial Plan will \nbe provided by a high level administrator hired or appointed for this purpose. \n \nStandards and Criteria \nDJJ and the Consent Decree mental health experts will develop standards and criteria with \nthresholds of compliance for all action items listed in this Remedial Plan. The instruments used \nto measure and evaluate compliance may include indicators from sources cited in Section 8, \n“Policies and Procedures,” that the experts judge to be critical to establishing an adequate mental \nhealth care system. The evaluation instruments will include components requiring professional \njudgment and components that can be objectively evaluated by non-experts. Thresholds for \nachieving compliance may vary for selected indicators, however the facility must obtain an \noverall score of 85 percent or greater for the facility to achieve substantial compliance as defined \nin paragraph 23 of the Consent Decree. \n    Page 75 \n\n \n \nIn addition to the standards and criteria that will be developed to track implementation of this \nplan, DJJ will prepare an integrated project schedule showing dates by which all action items are \nto be started and/or completed. This schedule is to include, but not be limited to, when new staff \nare to be hired and trained, when existing residential mental health programs will be modified in \naccordance with this Plan, when new residential mental health living units will open, and when \nnew assessment tools and procedures will be in place.  \n \nACTION PLAN \n \n1.  DJJ will add or appoint a senior administrator with experience in implementing mental health \nprograms to oversee and direct implementation of this Remedial Plan and its coordination \nwith other Remedial Plans. This person will be hired or appointed no later than February 29, \n2007. \n \n2.  DJJ will add or appoint four senior clinicians and/or senior administrators with expertise in \nmental health services to represent mental health issues and facilitate implementation of this \nplan. These staff will be part of the divisions’ reform implementation team. They will be \nadded or appointed no later than October 31, 2006. \n \n3.  DJJ will develop a dedicated mental health training team consisting of at least three licensed \nclinicians plus an instructional designer and office technician by no later than January 31, \n2007. \n \n    Page 76 \n\n \nREFERENCES\n \n \nAbram KM, Teplin LA, Charles DR, Longworth SL, McClelland GM, Dulcan MK: \nPosttraumatic stress disorder and trauma in youth in juvenile detention. \nArchives of General Psychiatry. 61(4):403-10, 2004 \nBarnoski R.

INTRODUCTION \nCalifornia Youth Authority (CYA  ) is  implementing the  12-Stage Sexual Behavior Treatment \nProgram at  its facilities, which will significantly increase the availability and scope of sexual \nbehavior specific treatment. The purpose of the CY A Sexual Behavior Treatment Program is to \nadvance the  Department's mission to  protect  the public  by rehabilitating wards  who  have a \nhistory of sexual offenses through providing a continuum of treatment and training approaches. \nThe CYA    12-Stage  program  utilizes  a  multi-disciplinary  team  of professional,  clinical  and \nsupport staff to  provide treatment to  wards with a history of sexual offenses.  The  12-Stage \nsexual behavior program establishes Outpatient Sexual Behavior Treatment Programs (OSBTP) \nin each institution.  The 12-stage program is a comprehensive, department-wide system, which \nstandardizes the process, assessment, and treatment of offenders from intake through parole.  It \nimplements  a  standardized  model  and  cUITiculum  that  encompasses  all  levels  of the  mental \nhealth continuum of care, and can be customizcd for the needs of each offender. The 12-Stage \nprogram  utilizes  a  case  management  approach  and  curriculum,  which  maximizes  treatment \nopportunities, unifies the treatment approach across disciplines, provides for continuous service \nbetween facilities, and shifts the onus of responsibility and progress to the individual offender. \nThe 12-Stage Program is devised to assess and provide an appropriate level of care to address the \nneeds of the individual.  The 12-Stage Sexual Behavior Treatment Program is founded on some \nkey principles.  These principles include: \nA.  Treatment Availability \nSexual  Bchavior  Treatment  will  be  allorded  to  all  wards  that  have  a  need  for \ntreatment in the CY A.  Treatment will be rendered through a continuum of services \nand treatment programs for youth with sexual behaviors and services will be tailored \nto the individual based on  three levels of care, residential, outpatient and outpatient \nhealthy sexuality. \nB.  Standardized Programming \n•  Sexual  Behavior Treatment  Programming  and  curriculum  is  standardized. \nThe I 2-Stage curriculum is progressive to the end of depth and intemalization \noftrcatlllent concepts. Completion of the program will be competency based. \n•  Standardized specific training and certification is provided to eYA staff who \nwork in the twelve-stage treatment progran1. \n•  Standardized  treatment  modules,  concepts,  and  hours  of treatment  will  be \noffered to wards who have a history of sexual offenses within the Behavior \ntreatment programs. \nPage - 3 \n\nRemedial Plan - Sexual Behavior Treatment  Section 1 \nService Delivery System \n•  Standardized  psychological  assessmcnt  and  pre- and  post-testing  will  be \nutilized and reasonable accommodations will be made to administer a battery \nof psychometric  pre- and  post-program  measures  that  are  consistent  with \ncurrent  industry  standards.  Post-test measures will measure the objectivcs \nconsistent with completion ofthe program. \nC.  Individualized TI\"eatment \nParticipants will be afforded individualized treatment planning.  Identified special \nneeds  pm1icipants  (i.e.  mental  health,  dual  diagnosis,  cognitively  challenged, \npsychopathic, wards with cases under appeal, etc.) will be afforded individualized \ntreatment planning based on their needs. Standardized treatment programming will be \ntailored to the needs of the individual as supported by the current research.  Sexual \nBehavior Treatment Programming will be integrated with  the  CY A  mental  health \ncontinuulll of care. \n1.  Developmentally Disabled/Low Cognitive Functioning Participants \nCurrently there are 13 identified developmentally disabled wards in the Youth \nAuthority in need of sexual behavior treatment.  There is a greater number of \nLow Cognitive Functioning wards that are identified through lEP evaluations \nthat are in need of sexual behavior treatment.  It is expected that many of these \nwards will be placed in residential programs through the screening process. \nAll  staff assigned  to  thc  Sexual  Behavior Treatmcnt Program  will  receive \nannual training specifically designed for the treatment of lower functioning \nwards. A selected group from each program will be allow cd the opportunity to \nvisit other Sexual  Behavior Treatmcnt Programs that treat developmentally \ndisabled  individuals  with  a  history  of sexual  offenses  such  as  those  in \nDevelopmental Centers and State Hospitals. \nThe  Scxual  Behavior  Treatment  Program  Coordinator  will  monitor  the \nnumber of developmentally disabled wards with a history of sexual offenses \nin each of the residential and olltpatient programs and will attempt to evenly \ndistribute the numbers.  The Coordinator will also oversee the additional staff \ntraining. \n2.  Psychopathic Ward with a history of sexual offenses \nThe Hare Psychopathy Checklist, Revised (PCL-R) and the Hare PCL Youth \nVersion (peL: YV) will be administered by psychologists when they suspect \nthat the ward is psychopathic. Staff\",;ll be allotted additional training focllsed \non treating psychopaths. \nThe Sexual  behavior Task  Force will  monitor new  research  related  to  the \ntreatment of Psychopathic individuals with a history of scxual offenses and \nma~e recommendations  to  alter  the  curriculum  and  treatment  approach  as \nneeded.  This includes making recommendations for training for staff. \nPage -.$ \n\nRemedial Plan - Sexual Behavior Treatment  Section I \nService Delivery System \n3.  Female \\Vard with a history of sexual offenses \nCurrently Female Sexual Behavior Treatment Groups are being done at the \nVenture Youth Correctional Facility. \nThese  groups  are  being  lead  by  a  psychologist  employed at  that  facility. \nCurrently, the Youth Authority docs not have a specific curriculum for female \nward with a history of sexual offenses. \nThe  Sexual  behavior  Task  Force.  in  conjunction  with  consultant  with \nexpertise in  sexual offenders, will research appropriate treatment modalities \nspecific to the female population and develop a separate curriculum.  This task \nwill be accomplished by March 2006. \n4.  Cases on Appeal \nWards who claim to have an appeal pending and report that they are unable to \nparticipate in Sexual Behavior Treatment will bc required to provide a letter \nfrom their attorney that includes the following: \n\"Based  on  his/her  current  court  appeal,  my  client  cannot  discuss  the \ncase/speak about the elcments of the (alleged) offense(s).\" \nThe case documentation will be forwarded to the Sexual Behavior Treatment \nCoordinator to track and monitor the appeal.  The ward will be placed in the \ngeneral population and once the appeal is resolved, the ward will be assigned \nto the appropriate trcatmcnt program.  Appeals not related to the ward sexual \nbehavior history should not intenupt treatment. \n5.  The Unsuccessful Residenti'al Program Ward \nThere are wards who arc not emotionally or psychologically prepared to make \nchanges in their thought process or behavior.  Hence, they refuse to participate \nor simply fail  to demonstrate any initiative in treatment. An interdisciplinary \ntreatment  team  case  conference  will  be  conducted  for  wards  (hat  are \nunsuccessful  in  residential  sexual  behavior  treatment.  The  case  will  be \nassessed  by  the  treatmcnt  team  and,  if possible,  (he  Sexual  Behavior \nTreatment  Coordinator.  The ward will  then be offered  the  opportunity to \nexpress their opinion/appeal at  a Youth Authority Administrative COlllmittee \nMeeting. A revised treatment plan may include the following options: \na)  The  ward  may be  moved  to  another Residential  Sexual  Behavior \nTreatment Program, \nb)  The  ward  Ill'ly  be  moved  to  the  Outpatient  Sexual  Behavior \nTreatment Program. or \nc)  The ward may he remo\\\"Cd from Residential Treatment for a specific \nperiod of time and then returned to  a residential program at  a later \nspeci fled  time. At times \\\\·ards need to Ica\\·e the program to  mature \nand arc then ahle to rcturn to residential treatmcnt. \nel)  The Coordinator will  track  and  monitor all  ward  movcment  in  the \nScxual f3eha\\·ior Treatment Program, residential or outpatient sexual \nbehavior treatment. \nPage - 5 \n\nRemedial Plan -Sexual Behavior Treatment  Section I \nService Delivery System \nD  Continuum of Services \nWards  with  a  history of sexual  offenses  will  be  offered  a  continuum  of sexual \nbehavior services to include inpatient, outpatient, mental health programs, aftercare, \nand society transition services. This will ensure the same standard of care will occur \nthroughout the Department for all sex offenders. \nE.  Integrated Services \nSexual  behavior  programming  will  include  integrated  services  inclllding \npsychosexual education, individual and group psychotherapy, family integration, and \npsycho-educational groups.  This includes the involvement of educational/vocational \nand health care services.  Interdisciplinary teams will meet to discuss issues gcnnane \nto the ward's performance and progress in treatment, which will occur every ninety \ndays through case conference. \n1.  Psychoph armacological Services \nWards will be assessed on an individual basis to determine if a referral needs \nto be made to the institutional psychiatrist.  The psychologist assigned to the \nward  will  conduct  thc  assessment  based  on  clinical  obscrvation,  staff \nobservation of ward's daily behavior and, if nccessary, psychological testing. \nWards  will  be referred  through  the current WIN referral  system. This  will \nalert  the  medical  office  to  place  the  ward  on  an  appointment  list  for  the \npsychiatrist to see the following week .. \n2.  Educational Services \nWards will receive access to educational services related  to their individual \nneeds in their High School Graduation Plan, including special education and \nresource.  A  representative  from  education  will  also  participate  in  case \nconferences to report the ward's progress and the assigned parole agent will \nattend the ward's lmlividual Education Plan meeting to report the ward's daily \nliving status. \n3.  Health Care Services \nMedical and dental services arc provided to all wards in the Youth Authority. \nGenerally, wards wbo have a medical concem or complaint will fill out an on \ncall request to see the MT A, unless it is an emergency.  After seeing the ward, \nthe MTA generally makes a determination to refer the ward to the medical \ndoctor, dentist. or psychiatrist.  AllY critical medical concerns will be brought \nto the attention of the Chief Medical Officer. \n\nRemedial Plan - Sexual Behavior Treatment  Section I \nService Delivery System \nF.  Sexual Behavior Treatment Coordinator \nA Coordinator will  monitor the consistency of the SBTP in the CYA  ; will oversee \nstandardized  implemcntation  of programming components  and will  coordinate the \ntraining  of  Sexual  Behavior  Treatment  staff.  The  Sex  Behavior  Trcatment \nCoordinator  (SBTC)  will  oversee  movement  to  and  from  the  residential  and \noutpatient sexual  behavior programs.  The SBTC will  also  monitor the residential \nSBTP to ensure that  identified wards for the Sexual behavior Programs are evenly \ndistributed  among  the  programs  available.  In  addition,  the  SBTC  will  attempt  to \nequalize the numbers of lower functioning/developmentally delayed wards at the four \nresidential  SBTP's.  The  SBTC  will  also  monitor  the  number  of wards  in  the \noutpatient  programs  and  attempt  to  equalize  these  numbers  according  to  the \ninstitutions' available resources. Finally, the SBTC will also attempt to keep south em \nwards in one of the southern institutions and northern wards in one of the northern \ninstitutions in order to keep them close to their families. \nC.  Sexual Behavior Task Force \nThe Sexual  behavior Task  Force (SBTF) will  consist of treatment team  members \nfrom each j~lCility. fleld parole, the Sexual Behavior Treatment Program Coordinator \nand the research program specialist.  The SBTF will meet on a quarterly basis.  The \nSBTF members will be appointed by September 2005. \nThe following arc tbe expectations for the SBTF: \n1.  Implementation Process: \nThe SBTF will  a play critical role  in  the  implementation of the remedial \nplan and conduct the following activities: \n•  Evaluate the validity of the SORD as  it  relates  to  the protocol  and \nplacement  procedures.  An  evaluation  plan  will  be  completed  by \nJanuary 2006. \n•  Develop curriculum for the Outpatient Healthy Sexuality Program.

INTRODUCTION \nThe California Youth Authority will  establish the  Sexual Behavior Treatment Program either \nresidential,  outpatient  or  both  which  shall  be  a  comprehensive  and  integrated  system  of \nassessment, treatment and education for wards with sexual bchavior problems. Assessment and \ntreatment of these young people will begin at intake and continue for the duration of a ward's \nincarceration and parole. \nII.  PARTICIPANTS \nWards who mcet the following criteria are eligible for the program: \nI)  A ward committed under the provision of Welfare and Institutions' code 727.6. \n2)  A ward with a prior adjudication/conviction of a sexual offense (s). \n3)  Wards  who  are  not  committed  under 727.6  WIC  however,  are  identified  as \nneeding  sexual  offender  treatment,  shall  be  refelTed  to  the  director  or the \ndirector's designee for consideration of placement in sexual behavior treatment \nThe CY A SORD will be used to prioritize the most serious sexual offenders for placement. The \nSORD is completed at the Reception Center and Clinic. It is also completed when wards disclose \nnon-documented  sexual  offenses,  commit  new  sexual  offenses  or who  develop  a  pattem  of \ndeviant sexual behavior.  Risk ratings on the SORD may be oVTrridden if information suggests \nthat an individual may be at greater risk than his score on this instrument suggests. \nThe current SORD will be evaluated according to the latest research on juveniles with problem \nsexual behaviors. An initial validation of this instrument will be conducted. \nBased  on  this triage  system wards with  sexual  problems will  then  be  referred  to  either the \nResidential Program (RSBT) for those with the highest rating. the Outpatient Program (OSBT) \nor to a class in Healthy Sexuality whose behavior is considered low risk. \nWards with mental health needs who qualify for an  Intensive Treatment Program, Specialized \nCounseling Program or Specialized Behavior Treatment Program, and whose needs can be best \nserved in one of those treatment programs, will receive outpatient sexual offender programming \nand curriculum within the context of their treatment program. \nThe wards that are not placed  in  a RSBTP will be  placed in  the OSBTP.  There \\\\'ill  be  an \nOutpatient Sexual 01Tender treatment program in each institution. \nPaoc- J() \n\" \n\nRemedial Plan - Sexual Behavior T reatmenl  Section 2 \nProgram and Curriculum \nIII.  POLICIES AND PROCEDURES \nAll  aspects  of the  Sexual  Behavior  Treatment  Program  will  be  outlined  in  policies  and \nprocedures  which  will  be  written  under  the  supervision  of the  Sexual  Behavior Treatment \nProgram Coordinator in  consultation  with  the  Sexual  Behavior Task  Force,  and  the outside \nconsultant with experience in sex offender treatment. \nIV.  WRITTEN CURRICULUMS \nCY A will follow up with a publishing company that prepares workbooks/journals corresponding \nto  the major treatment modalities including all  resource groups. Additional  material  shall be \ndeveloped for developmentally disabled participants, females and Spanish speakers. \nV.  ASSESSMENTS AND INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLANS \nUpon admission to the SBTP. each participants will be administered a standardized assessment \nto identify treatment needs. The assessment will provide the basis for the development of an \nindividualized  treatment  plan,  which  will  be  monitored  hy  a  multi-disciplinary  team  on  a \nqumierly basis. This practice is cUlTently occurring in the Youth Authority. \nVI.  RESIDENTIAL SEXUAL BEHAVIOR TREATMENT PROGRAM \nThe Residential  Sexual  Behavior Treatment  Program will  provide paJiicipants with  intensive \ntreatment and learning services for re-entry into society. The programs are primarily designed to \nserve the high and moderate risk sexual offenders. \nThere are  four (4) Residential  Sexual Behavior Treatment Programs that  total  207  treatment \nbeds. Currently, these programs are located in four (4) Youth COlTectional Facilities (YCF). \n1)  OH  Close  YCF - the  Sexual  Behavior Treatment  Program - this  program  is \nlocated in  Stockton,  California and it  generally houses tbe Northern  California \nyounger scxua1 wards. \n2)  NA  Chadeljian YCF - the  Sexual  Behavior Treatment Program  is  located  in \nStockton,  California  and  this  program  houses  the  older.  Northern  California \nwards. \n3)  Southem  Youth  Correctional  Center  Clinic  the  Sexual  Behavior Treatment \nProgram is  located in Norwalk, California.  This program generally houses the \nyounger Southel11 California wards. \n4)  Herman G.  Stark YCF  the Sexual Behav'ior Treatment Program  is located 111 \nChino, California.  This program houses the older, Southern California wards. \nThere arc 207 Residential Sexual  Beha\\ior Program beds. Currently. residential treatment will \nusc  a core cognitive/behavioral approach.  Ilowe\\eL the treatment approach  may he amended \naccording to the principles of evidenced-based therapies. which mav suggest that alternative or \nadditional strategies may be more effective. Currently. the program is divided ill10 12 stages. \nPage - 11 \n\nRemedial Plan -Sexual Behavior Treatment  Section 2 \nProgram and Cuniculum \nTen stages are provided in the residential program, Stage II  is provided on  'Maintenance' in \ngeneral population, and  Stage 12 is provided on parole. The  10 residential stages are grouped \ninto three phases: Orientation, Core Program and Relapse Prevention. \nThe 10 stages have been written so  that lower and  higher functioning  wards can both move \nthrough the stages.  The treatment team will adapt the assignments to the ward's abilities. Upon \nmeeting the expectations of the I O-Stage Residential Sexual Behavior Treatment Program, wards \nwill advance to Stage 11, which is a 'Maintenance' stage in the general popUlation.  Stage 12 \n(aftercare) occurs in  the community under parole supervision, utilizing a 'continuum of care' \nmodel. \nA.  Treatment Modalities \nTreatment  hours  on  the  SBTP  will  be  20  hours  a  week,  with  the  exception  of \ninstitutional emergencies. The following treatment hours are recommended as part of \nthe current identified curriculum: \n•  Sexual behavior group is co-facilitated by a Psychologist and A \nYouth Correctional Counselor (YCC) in a slllall group setting with 6-\n7 wards  3 hours \n•  Residential large group (2 groups per week) led by the Senior Youth \nCorrectional Counselor (SYCC)  4 hours \n•  Resource Groups (2 groups per week) to include Core:  I) Victims \nAwareness, 2) Criminal Thinking Errors, 3) Addictive Behavior. 4) \nHuman Sexuality, 5) Interpersonal Skill, 6) Additional Resource \nGroups as recommended by Treatment Team Survivor's Group, 7) \nStress Management and 8) Anger Management  3 hours \n•  Individual work to include Case Conference and sessions with \nPsychologist! YCCiSYCc/CWSiIP/vYOPB  4 hours \n•  Sexual behavior treatment homework such as behavioral task \nassignnlents, fan1ily interaction assignnlcnts, residential, COrnITILmity \nactivities, and other treatment activities (does not include \neducational/vocational homework).  6 hours \nTotal: 20 II ours per week \nThe residential portion of the Sexual Offenders Treatment Program (the first  10 Stages) \nwill be approximately 24 months in duration. However, since the program is competency \nbased, not all wards will progress through the stages at the samc rate. Some wards may be \nhighly motivated and able to complete the program in less than 24 months. Other wards \nmay  be more resistant.  in  deniaL  fixated.  or entrenched  in  sexual  predatury behavior. \nwhich will inhibit them from moving forward in treatmcnt. \nPage-i2 \n\nRemedial Plan - Sexual Behavior Treatment  Section 2 \nProgram and Curriculum \nB.  Family Counseling \nIn  the  Residential  Sexual  Behavior Treatment  programs,  there  will  be  a  family \ncounseling component in Stages three, six and nine. If deemed appropriate, and the \nfamilies are willing and able to participate, the program will offer a minimum of three \nfamily counseling sessions at each one ofthe three stages of treatment. \nC.  Discharge Criteria \nThe determination  of Residential  Sexual  Offender Program  successful  completion \nwill  be  competency  based  and  determined  by  measurable  objectives  reflecting \ntreatment  completion  and  goal  obtainment.  Wards  will  be  assessed  on  their \naccomplishmcnt of speci fie  changes  in  outcome measures  and  behavior and their \nability to apply their knowledge to their daily functioning.  Wards will be assessed on \nboth their behavior and on the attainment of treatment goals and their treatment gains \nfrom  the  10-Stage Residential Sexual Offender Cuniculum.  This will be done via \ntheir individual treatment plan and monitored at each case conference. \nD.  Maintenance Stage \nMaintenance will occur while the ward is housed in the general popUlation. The goal \nof thc  Maintenance Stage will be to continue to reinforce the concepts, therapeutic \nissues, and relapse prevention techniques covered during the first ten stages.  Parole \npreparation will  also  be included.  Wards in  the  Maintenance Group(s) will  come \nfrom  both Residential  and  Outpatient Sexual  Offender Treatment Programs.  There \nwill  be a standard curriculum for  the Maintenance Group(s).  Each institution will \nha\\'c  at  least  one  Maintenance  Group.  Considering  the  current  ward  population, \napproximately  10  wards  will  be  considered  for  each  group.  Each  group  may be \nscheduled for 90 minutes once a week. Each institution's Outpatient Psychologist and \nYCC arc recommended to  lead the Maintenance Group (s). \nVB.  OUTPATIENT SEXUAL BEHAVIOR TREATMENT PROGRAM \nAll wards with a history of sexual offenses I\\'ho are not idcntitJed for rcsidential placement will \nbe  placed  in  tbe  Outpatient  Sexual  Behavior  Treatment  Program  (OSBTP)  in  one  of the \nprogramming institutions.  Each programming institution will have at least one OSBTP. \nThe outpatient population will include wards within the general population that have either heen \nidentified  for  treatment  hut  do  not  meet  the  residential  criteria.  or  wards  who  are  on  the \nmaintenance stage. \nThe  duration  of treatmcnt in  the  Outpatient  Program  will  he  competency-based  (e.g.,  \\\\'arcls \nprogress through the program at  their oWn pace).  Some wards may requirc more timc to work \nthrough points of impasse.  Thesc wcmls may require a higher level of care such as a Residential \nTreatment Program.  The 10 stages halT also been written so that the cognitive level oftbe wards \nwill  not  impede  their  progression  through  the  stages.  The  treatment  team  will  adjust  the \nassignments to meet the Ivards' abilities. \nPage - 13 \n\nRemedial Plan - Sexual Behavior Treatment  Section 2 \nProgram and Curriculum \nA.  Treatment Hours \nEach ward will receive a minimum of 10 hours of sexual behavior-specific trcatment \nper week while in  the Outpatient Program.  Exceptions considered are institutional \nemergencies, such as an administrative lock-down.  The  treatment is recommended \nas follows: \n•  1 Sexual Behavior Group (with one psychologist and one YCC and \n10 wards)  2 hours \n•  1 Core Resource Group (Led by the YCC- each is 12 weeks in \nduration)  1.5 hours \n•  Individual Work with Psychologist/Treatment TeamlY AB on sexual \nbehavior issues (average)  5 bours \n•  Sexual Behavior Specific Treatment Homework Group: Written \ntreatment homework (not including schoolwork) behavioral/task \nassignments, family interaction, assignments and othcr treatment \nactivities  6 bours \nTotal: 10 Hours per Week \nVIII. HEALTHY SEXUALITY PROGRAM \nFollowing an assessment period in a sexual behavior treatment program, those wards for whom \nspecialized sexual behavior treatment does not appear to be warranted will be dismissed from the \nprogram and referred to a Healthy Sexuality class. Educational, mental health. SBTP or medical \nstaff may conduct these classes. These classes shall be conducted on a twelve-week rotation, \ncach class being at least one hour in duration. \nIX.  PAROLE \nA~~rERCARE \nAftercare  Treatment  will  begin  once  the  ward  is  released  into  the  community  for  parole \nsupervision.  The  goal  of this  phase  of treatment  is  to  continue  to  reinforce  the  concepts, \ntherapeutic  issues,  and  relapse  prevention  techniques  covered  previously.  The  parolce  will \nparticipate in the Sexual Behavior Aftercare Treatment Program while on parole.  This program \nwill  include  weekly group  counseling  and  individual  counseling.  Therapists  leading  Sexual \nBehavior Treatment Groups will utilize the curriculum similar to that used in the Maintenance \nGroups (Stage I I). \nThe  parole  sexual  behavior  aftercare  programs  will  be  designed  to  provide  comprehensive \nstandardized  re-integration  services  to  wards  during  the  transition  phase  of  their  parole \nexperience.  These  transitional  phases  will  enhance  on-going treatment  and  training,  provide \npublic  safety,  and  establish  eOllllllunity-based  resources  to  facilitate  the  continuulll  of care \nconcept.  The transition process is div'ided into three phases:  Pre-Release. Case klanagcmellt. \nand I'\",J ajnlcnancc. \nPa(Je -14 \n\" \n\nRemedial Plan - Sexual Behavior Treatment  Section 2 \nProgram and Curriculum \nA.  Phase I:  Pre-Release \nIn  this  phase  institutional  staff,  field  parole  agent,  atlercare therapist,  and  j~lmily \nmembers will collaborate with the offender prior to their parole consideration date to \ndevelop  the  parolee's  Transition/Aftercare  Program.  The  Aftercare  Program  will \noutline  the  steps  necessary  to  achieve  his/her  therapcutic  goals.  The  Parole \nPlacement Plans will be developed and will recommend whether the offender will be \nplaced in a group home or family residence.  Outpatient aftercare treatment can be \nprovided in either placement. \n1.  Parole Agent II, Specialist \nThe Parole Agent n, Specialist shall interview the offender either in person or \nvia telephonc prior to the parole consideration date.  For wards that may be \nparoling to a transitional program or require additional case preparation, the \nParole Agent II, Specialist shall consider interviewing the offender at least 90 \ndays  or  180  days  prior  to  the  parole  consideration  date.  During  these \ninterviews,  conferencing  should  be  conducted  with  the  Institution  Parole \nAgent or Casework Specialist, as well as the contract therapist. \nThis interview/conference is recommended in order to establish rappon with \nthe parolee, assess the parolee's progress in  treatment,  assess the parolee's \npotential risk to  re-offend, and develop an  individualized parole plan  while \nensuring the consistency of a treatment approach. \n2.  Aftercare Therapist \nAll parole offices provide atlereare services. The aftercare therapist assigned \nto each office shall meet with the ward who is being refelTcd to parole either \nin person, or via video or telephone.  The Aftercare Therapist will provide the \nclinical expertise on developing treatment dynamics that will be implemented \nin each parolees treatment plan. \nConferencing with institution parole agent/therapist and ward will occur prior \nto the parole consideration date.  The more difficult cases are recommended to \noccur 90  days  or  180  days  prior to parole  consideration  date.  This  is  to \ndevelop  an  individualized  parole  plan,  which  assumes  the  consistency  of \ntreatment  approaches  and  includes  placement  in  therapy.  CY A  will  train \naftercare therapist in a uniform treatment model which must bc adhered to. \nPage - 15 \n\nRemedial Plan - Sexual Behavior Treatment  Section 2 \nProgram and Curriculum \nB.  Phase II:  Case Management \nA  parolee who  has  been  incarcerated  for  an  extended period of time  in  a highly \nstmctured and controlled setting needs time, supervision, and assistance in adjusting \nto the myriad of new experiences they will encounter in the community.

Key Components \na)  Sexual  Behavior  Treatment  is  progresSive.  A  ward  never \n\"completes\" sexual behavior treatment.  Understood as a continuum, \nSexual Behavior Treatment is segmented into 12 stages with stage I \nas  the  beginning  stage  and  stage  12  being  Sexual  Behavior \nTreatment while on parole. \nb)  Participants  will  be  treated  in  a  Residential  (sexual  behavior \nspecifIC), an Outpatient (general population wards attending weekly \nSexual behavior Groups) setting or an Outpatient Healthy Sexuality \n(general  population  wards  attending  weekly  psycho-educational \ngroups) setting.  If treatment needs dictate,  ward with  a history of \nsexual offenses may be moved between Outpatient and Residential \nprograms. \nc)  Assessment  tools,  including  the  revised  Sex  Offender  Referral \nDocument (SORD), and  additional psychological  assessments may \nbe  utilized  for  purposes  of  placement  and  treatment  needs \nassessment. \nd)  Family counseling is an inteh'Tated aspect ofthe 12-Stage Program. \ne)  Special programs  and  curricula will  be  developed  for  wards with \nspecial  needs  (including  dual  diagnosis  wards,  developmentally \ndisabled  wards,  psychopathic  wards,  wards  who  have  cases  on \nappeal,  wards  housed  in  Restricted  Programs  and  Unsuccessful \nResidential Program wards). \nX.

Lastly, the Department will require that staff assigned to Sexual Behavior Treatment \nPrograms attend annual training in the area of sexual behavior treatment. All of the above shall \nbe implemented pursuant to the Dills Act. \nDue to the fact that the Department has difficulty recruiting casework specialists and \npsychologists who are experienced in the treatment of sex offenders, the Department will work \nwith Universities and professional Schools of Psychology to recruit qualified personnel and to \ndevelop an internship program. \nII.

CLOSE YOUTH \nCORRECTIONAL rACILITY \n(December 30, 2005) \n\nState of California  Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation \nJuvenile Justice \nDivision of Juvenile Facilities \nMemorandum \nDate  December 30, 2005 \nTo  Dom1a Brorby \nSpecial Master \nFarrell vs. Hickman \nSubject  DRAFT PLAN TO CLOSE THE INYO TEMPORARY DETENTION UNIT AT \nO.H. CLOSE YOUTH CORRECTIONAL FACILITY \nThe \"Stipulation Regarding Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan and Mental Health \nRemedial Plan\" signed December 1, 2005, requires that a plan be developed to close \nthe Inyo Temporary Detention Unit.  This plan is revenue neutral and was developed \nin consultation with Mr. Fred Mills, a nationally recognized expert in juvenile justice. \nThe proposals in this plan have been discussed with Mr. Ed Wilder, Acting Director \nof Division of Juvenile Justice, Division of Juvenile Facilities (DJJ) and developed \nby Mr. John Muschetto, Special Consultant  assigned to this project by Mr. Wilder. \nWe  believe  submitting  a  draft plan will  allow the  parties  input  into  the  final \nagreements. \nMr. Wilder has agreed to discontinue the use of the Inyo Temporary Detention Unit. \nWards assigned to temporary detention at the O.H. Close Youth Correctional Facility \n(OHCYCF) will be housed in the \"wet rooms\" located in the dormitory living units. \nWe recommend wards assigned to temporary detention receive the same program \nafforded other wards. \nWe recommend DJJ be allowed to  utilize the Inyo Living Unit for the purposes \ndescribed in the Inyo Program Proposal section of this plan.  Mr. Wilder has made it \nvery clear, wards housed in the Inyo Living Unit will receive the same program and \nprivileges afforded other wards at the OHCYCF. \nAn effort has been made to incorporate some of Dr Krisberg's recommendations into \nthis plan (see attached  letter from  Dr.  Berry Krisberg  to  Donna Brorby dated \n12/13/05).  He has many years of experience with the problems facing the DJJ and an \nunderstanding of policy changes necessary to create change.  We recognize this plan \ndoes not address the root causes identified by Dr. Krisberg, but simply addresses a \nsymptom, which is the utilization of \"lock up units\" within the DJJ.  The elimination \nof the use of \"lock up units\" at this one facility is simply a first step in addressing Dr. \nKrisberg's concerns and recommendations.  This plan will change the approach used \nto manage unacceptable behavior at OHCYCF. \n\nDonna Brorby \nSpecial Master \nFarrell vs. Hickman \nPage 2 \nINYO PROGRAM PROPOSAL \nThe Inyo Living Unit space will be utilized to accommodate three fnnctions described \nas follows: \n•  Temporary Intervention Program. \n•  Provide housing, when necessary, for wards awaiting court proceedings or \ntransfer to other facilities. \n•  Provide housing for a ward suspected of a serious assault on staff or wards \ninvolving the use of a weapon. \nThese three programs will be described separately. \nI.  Temporary Intervention Program \nThe Temporary Intervention Program is a short-term intervention resource \nservice designed to assist wards and staff by aggressively providing problem \nsolving techniques to wards.  The Inyo Unit allows staff to escort wards to a \nneutral site, (lnyo Unit dayroom, kitchen, or rooms) in order to open dialogue, \nestablish problem-solving strategies, and determine appropriate interventions. \nThe Inyo Unit will only be used when other documented attempts to resolve \nthe problem have been attempted and failed or when it is necessary to resolve \nan emergency and prevent substantial harm to staff or wards.  When a ward is \nescorted to the Inyo Unit Temporary Intervention Program, staff will respond \nto the unit (Chief of Security, the Unit Treatment Team Supervisor (TTS) and \nthe wards living unit staff).  They will question the ward/wards, determine the \nproblem, the appropriate intervention and resolve the problem.  Wards will \nnot be assigned to the Inyo Living Unit.  The wards will: \n•  Return to their living unit. \n•  Transfer to a different living unit. \n•  Be referred to the appropriate medical/mental health professional, who \nwill  assume responsibility  for  determining  the  appropriate  setting or \nhousing. \n•  Be placed on temporary detention status in one of the living unit \"wet \nrooms\". \nStaff recognizes the manner, in which wards are treated, who cannot function \nwithin the norms that have been established, is of crucial importance.  It is \nessential to provide an action-oriented philosophy which recognizes, 1) The \n\nDOlma Brorby \nSpecial Master \nFarrell vs. Hickman \nPage 3 \naggressive acting out characteristics of many wards, 2) Realizes that certain \nactions must be carried out from at treatment standpoint, 3) Permits staff to \nuse best practice strategies in dealing with wards misbehavior or behavioral \nissues.  The goal will be to return the ward to his program unit as soon as \npossible. \nWe  are  not  suggesting  that  all  problems  be  solved  at  lnyo.  Most \nproblems/issues/behaviors should be solved or attempted to be solved in the \nward's assigned unit utilizing living w1it staff and living unit physical plant \n\"wet rooms\" if necessary.  However, taking these wards to Inyo gives staff the \nopportunity  to  interview  the  wards  and  see  the  wards  in  a  safe,  quite \natmosphere  where  there  is  no  audience/peer  pressure  to  influence  the \nintervention. \nThis is a good message for staff and wards and begins the process of doing \naway  with  \"being  locked  down  at  Inyo,  to  a  place  that is  utilized  for \nintervention when only absolutely necessary.\" \nExample: the past two days while visiting OHCYCF, there were two incidents \nwhere immediate interventions at Inyo resolved problems and wards were \nimmediately returned to their living units. \nThe first incident involved a smaller ward being picked on by a larger ward \nconcerning some religious item the smaller ward had.  The ward went to Inyo \nas  being  in  danger  from  others.  Immediately,  staff  (Chief  of \nSecurity/TTS/Hall staff etc.) responded to Inyo and questioned the ward, \ndetermined  the  problem,  determined  the  intervention,  and  resolved  the \nproblem.  The ward was immediately returned to his living unit. \nThe second incident involved a north/south fight in the school area.  Several \nfactors that staff witnessed indicated there might be more to the incident.  Six \nwards were taken to Inyo, not to be placed on TD, but to identify if there were \nany  further  issues  concerning  this  problem.  Immediately,  the  chief of \nsecurity, gang coordinator, and lodge staff responded to the Inyo Unit.  They \ninterviewed the wards, determined the problems, resolved the problems and \nreturned the wards to their living units. \nII.  Provide housing, when necessary, for wards awaiting court proceedings or \ntransfer to other facilities. \n\nDonna Brorby \nSpecial Master \nFarrell vs. Hickman \nPage 4 \nThere are going to be times when wards may be held at lnyo due to pending \ncourt cases, transfer to another institution, etc.  We are recommending that \nthese wards not be placed on TD status, but are actually assigned to the Inyo \nLiving Unit Program until they are transferred or until the pending court case \nis resolved.  Once assigned, treatment plans will be established that will \ninclude  education,  individual  counseling,  work  crew,  recreation,  group \nactivity, etc. within the program areas of Inyo.  Each individual treatment plan \nwill stress structured time out of rooms, instead of structured time in rooms. \nWards  will have appropriate bedding, clothing,  writing materials,  books, \nproperty etc.  Wards will eat meals out of their rooms. \nThe assignment to Inyo shall be as short of time as possible.  Wards being \ntransferred from OHCYCF to other facilities for disciplinary reasons should \nbe transferred immediately when possible.  The ideal count at lnyo will be no \ncount.  When  unit  counts  are  reduced,  and  an  appropriate  system  of \nclassification is established there will be less, if any reason to maintain lnyo \nand assigned staff can be redirected to support other institutional programs. \nNote:  \"Lockup Unit\" security protocols will not be used, i.e. mechanical \nrestraints, one on one escorts, cell feeding, spa recreational programs, etc. \nIII.  Provide housing for a ward suspected of serious assault on staff or wards \ninvolving the use of a weapon. \nThe goal should be to transfer a ward who meets this criteria as soon as \npossible; however, until the transfer is accomplished, the ward's individual \ntreatment plan will include a security section establishing the appropriate and \nreasonable security protocols to ensure staff or ward safety.  This placement \nwill only be utilized upon the review and approval of the Director, of DJJ. \nADMINISTRA nON AND SUPERVISION WHEN WARDS ARE HOUSED IN \nINYO \na)  Plan  of Operation:  The Treatment  Team  Supervisor in charge  of the  Inyo \nprogram will maintain a detailed \"Operational Procedure\" for the Program, which \nwill be reviewed and approved by the Superintendent on an annnal basis. The plan \nwill be updated as necessary to reflect current procedures and practices. \nb)  Management and Supervision:  The management of the Inyo Program will not be \ndelegated to a staff member below the Treatment Team Supervisor level.  The \n\nDonna Brorby \nSpecial Master \nFarrell vs. Hickman \nPage 5 \nsupervision of the program will not be delegated to a staff member below the \nlevel of Senior Youth Correctional Counselor. \nc)  Daily Visitation: On regular business days, the Treatment Team Supervisor will \nvisit wards assigned to the Inyo Program daily.  On weekends and holidays, the \nExecutive Officer and/or Duty Lieutenant will visit wards assigned to the Inyo \nProgram  daily.  Ward requests to  be visited by  other staff will be promptly \nreferred to the staff member.  A timely response should be given to such requests \nwhenever reasonably possible. \nd)  Manager/Supervisor  Responsibilities:  The  Inyo  Program  Treatment Team \nSupervisor is responsible for the sanitary working and living conditions within the \nunit.  When any condition within the unit or behavior, conduct or appearance of \nany  ward  confined  therein,  appears  to  warrant the  attention  of specific  or \nspecialized treatment staff, the matter will be promptly brought to the attention of \nthe appropriate staff. \ne)  Unit Inspections:  The OHCYCF Superintendent will inspeet the Inyo Program at \nleast weekly to ensure that conditions meet appropriate standards.  The Treatment \nTeam Supervisor will inspect the unit daily, during regular business hours. \nf)  Training:  All  staff who work with wards assigned to  the Inyo Living Unit \nProgram  will  receive training  on and  be  familiar  with  the  unit  operational \nprocedures. \nUNIT OPERATIONS \nWards will be provided the same clothing, bedding, hygiene items, food and property \nallowed wards in dormitory living units.

H. Close Youtb Correctional Facility (March) \nPage 2 \nThe INYO  Plan  of Operation has  been implemented.  The INYO \"lock-up  unit\" \nsecurity protocols were discontinued and replaced with an open program model for \nthe wards assigned to the INYO living unit. The use of the INYO living unit for \nwards  assigned  to  temporary  detention  status  has  been  discontinued.  The  post \norders for the INYO living unit staff positions have been revised.  OHCYCF staff \nreceived training on the revised Plan of Operations. Mr. Jolm Muschetto conducted \nweekI y site visits to develop the information for this report. \nI.  Temporary Intervention Program \nThe Temporary Intervention \nThe Temporary Intervention Program is a short-term intervention resource service \ndesigned  to  assist  wards  and  staff by aggressively providing  problem  solving \ntechniques to wards. The INYO Unit allows staff to escort wards to a neutral site, \n(INYO  Unit  dayroom,  kitchen,  or rooms)  in  order to  open  dialogue,  establisb \nproblem-solving  strategies,  and  determine  appropriate  interventions.  The INYO \nUnit  will only be used when other documented attempts to  resolve the problem \nhave been attempted and failed or when it is necessary to resolve an emergency and \nprevent snbstantial harm to staff and wards. When a ward is escorted to the INYO \nUnit Temporary Intervention Pro gram,  staff will  respond  to  the  unit  (Chief of \nSecurity,  the  Unit Treatment Team  Supervisor(TTS) and  the  ward's living unit \nstaff). They will question the ward/wards, determine the problem, the appropriate \nintervention and resolve  the  problem.  Wards will  not be  assigned  to  the  INYO \nLiving Unit. The wards will: return to their living unit; transfer to a different unit; \nbe referred to the appropriate medical/mental health professional, who will assume \nresponsibility for determining the appropriate setting or housing;  or be placed on \ntemporary detention status in designated approved \"wet rooms.\" \nAudit Findings: \nThe following is  the Inyo Temporary Intervention Program March 2006 monthly \nreport: \nIntake IReleaseslTime in Program \nMarch I, 2006 \n0855  Ward  transferred to HGSYCF. \n0925 - Ward _'eleased back to Del Norte Hall. \nTime at Inyo for intervention- 22 hrs. 25 min. \n£ \n1735 - Ward  released back to El Dorado Hall. \nTime at Inyo for intervention- 23 hrs. \n\nDonald Specter, Bernard Warner, and Donna Brorby \nMonthly Progress Report On The Plan To Close The Inyo Temporary Detention \nUnit At O.

Provide housing, when necessary, for wards awaiting court proceedings \nor transfers to other facilities. \nThere are going to be times when wards may be held at Inyo due to pending court \ncases,  transfers to other institutions, etc. We are recommending these wards will \nnot be placed on  TD  status,  but  are  actually assigned  to  the  Inyo  Living  Unit \nProgram until they are transfelTed or until the pending court case is resolved. Once \nassigned, treatment plans will be established that will include education, individual \ncounseling, work crew, recreation, group activity, etc. within the program areas of \nthe Inyo. Each individual treatment plan will require structured time out of rooms, \ninstead of structured time in rooms. Wards will have appropriate bedding, clothing, \nwriting materials, books, property, etc. Wards will eat meals out of their rooms. \nThe assigm11ent to Inyo shall be as short a period of time as possible. Wards being \ntrans felTed  from  OHCYCF to  other facilities  for  disciplinary reasons  should be \ntrans felTed immediately when possible.

Wards  have  been  allowed  personal \nproperty in their rooms that is stored in plastic containers issued by Inyo staff. All \nInyo assigned ward programs are documented on individual ward treatment plans. \nWard program generally begins at 0900 hours and runs through 1930 hours daily. \nThis is a total often and one-half hours daily that wards may be out of their rooms. \nAs  the  program has been developing staff have  increased their  enthusiasm  and \ncreativity  to  meet the programs  goals  as  they realize  the  effectiveness of their \nactions.  Inyo  staff stated they arc having no major disruptive behaviors such  as, \npounding on doors, destroying rooms, etc. since implementing the Inyo Intervention \nprogram. Inyo is clean, quiet and relaxed. \nHI.  Provide housing  for  a  ward suspected of serious  assault ou  staff or \nwards involving the use of a weapon. \nThe goal should be to transfcr a ward who meets this criteria as soon as possible; \nhowever, until the transfer is accomplished, the ward's individual treatment plan \nwill include a security section establishing the appropriate and reasonable security \nprotocols to ensure ward and staff safety. This placement will only be utilized upon \nthe review and approval of the Director, of DJJF. These ward placements will be \nreviewed on a weekly basis by the Director's office to ensure the ward is receiving \nappropriate services and the ward continues to meet the criteria to be housed on \nInyo Living Unit. \nAudit Findings: \nIntake/Releases/Time in Program \nThere were no wards assigned to Inyo for the month of March under criteria III. \nSummary of Audit Findings: \nSubstantial Compliance \nSubstantial Compliance to this section is indicated as there were no wards assigned \nto Inyo for the month of March under criteria III of the Inyo Program Statement. \nINYO Compliance Report \nBeginning February 1,  2006, OHCYCF fully implemented the Inyo  Intervention \nProgram. This essentially closed lnyo Hall as a \"lock-up\" unit housing wards on TD \nstatus and converted it to  an intervention unit.

H. Close Youth Correctional Facility (March) \nPage 10 \nOverall, the progress and operation of Inyo has been positive and well supported by \nOHCYCF staff. The administration and staff have endorsed the program and have \nworked exceedingly hard to make it work.  During the months of February and \nMarch there have been no instances at INYO where chemical or physical restraint \nhas  been ntilized.  The building is  clean,  well maintained,  and  the conditions  of \nconfinement are  being met.  The atmosphere is  relaxed and staff working INYO \ngenerally state that the wards have been well behaved. \nTraining has been provided to institutional staff explaining the INYO Temporary \nIntervention Program.  The administration continues  to  nurture the program  and \nstress the change in philosophy from using Inyo as a \"lock-up\" unit, to using Inyo \nas a problem-solving unit.  The leadership displayed by  Director \nDivision of Juvenile Facilities,  Superintendent OHCYCF, \nand  has  greatly  contributed  to  the  unit's  successful \ntransition. \nThe INtO Temporary Intervention Program, as designed, appears to be serving the \nwards and staff as  a positive asset that supports the rehabilitative efforts  being \nprovided at the OHCYCF. \nJohn  Muschetto  and  Steve  Cambra  are  available  to  auswer  any  questions  with \nregards to  this report.

Currently about 250 wards are participating \nin the following facilities: \n•  O. H. Close Youth Correctional Facility Stockton, \nCalifornia \n•  N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility Stockton, \nCalifornia \n•  Herman G. Stark Youth Correctional Facility Chino, \nCalifornia \n•  Southern Youth Correctional Reception Center and Clinic \nNorwalk, California \nThese programs are designated as Residential Programs as the wards live together on designated \nhousing units. The aim is to provide 20 hours a week therapy through a combination of core \ngroups, resource groups, large groups, individual and family therapy. Wards spend various \namounts oftime in treatment, depending upon when they are transferred to these facilities and how \nlong their sentences run. Program administrators said that there was a waiting list for the Sexual \nBehavior Treatment Program (SBP), but they were unable to produce the list before the \npreparation of this report. \nThe plan submitted to the courts also outlines a ten hour per week Outpatient Treatment Program \nfor wards in each of the remaining facilities including Ventura Youth Correctional Facility which \nhouses females. There is a small informal program for the girls at Ventura. However, there are no \nother Outpatient programs at this time. \nThe plan outlines a continuum of care which includes triaging all wards convicted of a sex offense \nor whose behavior suggests a need to treat inappropriate sexual conduct into three groups. Wards \nwith minimal need for treatment will receive a psycho-educational course in Healthy Sexuality. \nThe other individuals will receive either Residential or Outpatient treatment, followed by \nmaintenance groups after they have completed the more intensive programs and then participation \nin aftercare programs in the community. Maintenance programs have not been implemented. The \n1 \n\nstaff has been unable tr'et any infonnation about the Aftercare ~-ograms which is operated by the \nParole Department, \nThe program is staffed by a group of devoted psychologists and youth workers who have lacked \nsufficient resources and overall direction. Currently they are attempting to implement a \ncomprehensive unified program \nEVALUATION OF COMPLIANCE \nI calculated the degree of compliance with all the issues defined in the SBTP plan submitted to the \ncourts. The plan did not include a time line for each of the issues. However, for several issues time \nframes were referenced. Where this was the case, I have referenced that the Task Force is making \nprogress towards those issues. Where no reference was made to deadlines, I have assessed the \ncurrent level of compliance. \nAn attempt was made to calculate exact percent of compliance. However, in all cases involving the \nevaluation based on the official records, there in so much inconsistency that percentages could not \nbe fairly ascertained. \nAudit Criteria: \n•  Policies and Procedures-the Sexual Behavior Task Force has set a deadline of July, 2006 \nto complete the P & P Manual. The Task Force is actively working on that goaL \no  General policies and procedures \n•  I was infonned by the staff that no written policies or procedures specific to \nthe SBTP have been developed but those are being developed .. \no  Policies and procedures related to ethics/rights of wards-See comment above. \n•  I have not received any policies or procedures which address issues of \nconfidentiality or informed consent specifically for the SBTP. \no  Policies provide for equitable vocational training opportunities-See comment \nabove. \n•  I have not been provided with any policies at aiL Thus I have not reviewed \nany policy which mandates in writing that wards convicted of sexual \noffenses are offered appropriate vocational opportunities. \n..  Clinical notes and observations on the following \no  Special needs groups-The Sex Behavior Task Force has set a deadline of June, \n2006 to adapted the curriculum for the developmentally disabled as well as other \nspecial needs populations such as non-English speakers or the mentally ill.-Partial \nCompliance \n•  I observed a Spanish language core group at Stark which was composed of \na psychologist, a Youth Counselor who served as the translator and two \nparticipants. One participant was describing his offense, and this was \neffectively translated to the psychologist and myself. There was minimal \ngroup interaction but this was due to the nature of the discussion. \nSupportive interaction was observed between staff and participants. \n•  Other institutions apparently do not currently have specialized SBTP group \nfor special needs populations. However, Chaderjian does have a special \nmental health program (The Stanford Project) which has an \"infonnal sex \noffender program.\" The SBTP staff reported that this program is a \nresidential program for special needs wards but is run by Parole Agents \nrather than mental health professionals. However, this is not being \n2 \n\n'ordinated with the SBTP, and the trea'  \"nl is not provided by mental \n,,-:ulth professionals. \no  Core groups-Inconsistencies in doc1llllentation make evaluation of compliance \nimpossible. \n•  Group notes are kept in a variety of different files depending upon the \ninstitution. At Close the group notes are kept in notebooks maintained by \nthe different psychologists. The notes are on the whole !,'TOUp. not on \ndifferent participants. Of the three psychologists preparing these notes, two \nof the three records were essentially LUlfeadable. Dr. Bowles used a form \nentitled Treatment Progress Evaluation which did address sex offender \nissues. Notes from other two psychologists tended to focus on here and now \nissues with process rather than content being commented on. The group that \nI did observe was run by Dr. Herkovic and Y.C. Curry. It ran for 45 \nminutes and focused on a new member presenting his sexual history. There \nwas good group interaction with positive interaction between the therapists \nand participants. \n•  A core group was not available to be observed at Chaderjian as none were \nscheduled on the day of our visit. The group notes had been prepared on the \nWIN system, printed out and filed in individual hall fields. Up until \nFebruary, 2005 the staff had used a group note template which appeared to \nbe very useful. However, after that date the form was no longer used. Dr. \nKirkwood stated that the foml had disappeared from the WIN system, and \nthey were unable to access it. The notes are not identified as to whether \nthey are referring to a core group, a resource group or individual therapy \nand sometimes this could not be detected even by reading them. There also \nneeds to be notation as to time the service occurred. \n•  A core group was not available to be observed at Stark as none were \nscheduled on the day of our visit .. \n•  I observed two groups at the Southem Reception Center. The first group \nwas run by Dr. Louyn and YC Jessie for 7-9 participants in a very crowded \nroom. Three of the participants were paroling in the immediate future and \nwere talking with the rest of the group about their offenses and cycles. The \nparticipants were enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Therapists were very \nsupportive and encouraging. The group ran for three hours with active \nparticipation throughout. Some of the group members appeared to showing \noff for me. However, overall the group appeared to be functioning \neffectively as a cognitive behavioral treatment for inappropriate sexual \nbehavior. The second core group that I observed was run by Dr. Courelli \nand YC Shanks for 10 participants, again in a very crowded space. Several \nof these participants had been in Dr. Louyn' s group as well and all but two \nwere about to be paroled. Dr. Courelli had shown the movie, The \nWoodsman, and had prepared questions which the group discussed in an \ninsightful way. I asked Dr. Courelli if the therapists shared this type of \nmaterial with each other, and she agreed that this would be a good idea but \nis not currently done. \no  Individual therapy -Partial compliance \n•  The group notes on individual therapy are maintained in the medical file \nwhich is kept in the Health Unit, not accessible to either the psychologists \nor to the rest ofthe SBTP team. Most of the individual treatment notes \nwhich I reviewed focused on general adjustment, rather than sexual, \nbehavior. \n3 \n\no  Resour  groups-( The Sex Behavior Task Fore  . as set a deadline of January, \n2006 tu \"eve lop a Dynamic and Experiential GUlue) Inconsistency of \ndocumentation make evaluation of the current program impossible. \n•  I observed a Criminal Thinking Group at Chad run by Youth Counselor \nStevens. This was the seventh of a ten week curriculum. The participants \nwere quite involved and insightful. The leader was positive and enthusiastic \nalthough more training would assist him in understanding different types of \noffenders, knowledge which would have been helpful to him in this \nsituation. \n•  I observed a casework gwup at Stark. It is difficult to know where this \ngroup fits into the current SBTP plan, or whether it should be considered a \nresource group. Three wards met with yc. Watson who had reproduced \nsome short articles on child abuse from a book entitled Power Source. \nHowever, this did not appear to be part of a larger curriculum. It would \nappear that were the counselor provided with one ofthe SBTP's curriculum \nthat it could presented in an effective manner, saving the counselor from \nhaving to devise activities on his or her own. The group leader interacted in \na very positive way with the participants \n•  It was difficult to find documentation of resource groups in the files. In \nsome institutions such as O.H. Close, these files arc kept in separate folders \nmaintained by the YC's and are limited to one note for each meeting rather \nthan separate notes for each participant. In some institutions notes for each \nparticipant are recorded in the WIN system but not printed out and filed in \nthe wards' files. In some institutions the notes are prepared on the WIN \nsystem, printed out and filed in individual's hall files. \no  Special resource groups-Not in compliance \n•  There was no evidence of special resource groups other than the substance \nabuse programs that are offered by the institution to all wards. \no  Family therapy-Partial compliance \n•  There were notes on family therapy for some wards which are being \nconducted at all institutions with the exception of Chad-where I was told \nthat family therapy could not be conducted per order of the administration. \no  Maintenance group-Not in compliance \n•  No maintenance groups appear to be operating. \no  Large group notes and observations-Not in compliance \n•  I observed the large group at O.II. Close which was conducted by the \nYouth Counselors for the 60 participants on Humboldt nnit. The program \nparticipants had prepared a skit complete with sets which depicted a young \nman going through the stages of treatment induding nnderstanding one's \nhistory and one's assault cycle and preparing a relapse prevention plan. The \naudicnce was very active in asking insightful questions. The Youth \nCounselors were very supportive. YC Cosetta Greg is a professional gospel \nsinger and has written a song celebrating the boys' birthdays which the \nlarge group convinced her to sing. \n•  I found only one note at the rest of the facilities which referred to a large \ngroup. This note recorded a discussion of housekeeping issues. \no  Therapeutic Community Activities-Not in compliance \n•  The above description of the large group at Humboldt reflects a Therapeutic \nCommunity activity but this appears to be an isolated incident. The staff \nneeds to be trained in developing TC community-building techniques. \no  Specialized services-Partial compliance \n4 \n\n•  '~'lere are specialized services for the wr  'q including a number of \nv,ograms such as Substance Abuse and\" ,dim Awareness which are \noffered to all wards. There are also special units for wards needing \nintensive mental health counseling. The Stanford Project at Chad does offer \nan \"informal sex offender treatment program.\" Reportedly this program is \noffered by parole agents with little or no training in providing treatment for \nsexually inappropriate behavior. \n•  Outpatient Program-Not in compliance \no  Not only is there no outpatient treatment program, staff has informed me that these \ninstitutions have not been told that they will expected to develop a comprehensive \nSBTP which will involve providing 10 hours a week treatment to all of their sex \noffenders. \no  Other than Ventura which houses the female SBTP, representatives of the facilities \nthat will house the Outpatient programs are not participating on the SBTF) \n•  Assessment (The SBTF has set a deadline of January, 2006 to evaluate the validity of the \nSORD) \no  Development of screening devise-Not in compliance \n•  The SORD is still being used. However, at least 30% of the files which I \nreviewed did not have SORD scores although at least 90% had completed \nSORD questionnaire \n•  A request has been made for a letter from the department stating that the \nSBTP wishes to participate in the norming of the J-SOAP, a widely \nrecognized risk assessment tool for juvenile sex offenders, However, this \nletter has not been received. \no  Implementation of screening devise-Not in compliance \no  Development of assessment protocol-Not in compliance \n•  The SBTF has been exploring instruments to be included in the assessment \nprocess. I did note that there are well-written psychological evaluations in \nall of the files. However, they vary in the issues that they address and do \nnot necessarily include sex offense-specific assessments although some of \nthe reports did use such tools. \no  Implementation of assessment protocol-Not in compliance \n•  Treatment Plans \no  Written treatment plans-Partial compliance \n•  All of the files contained Individual Change Plans and Annual Treatment \nReviews. \n•  There is no form which addresses the stcps in the SBTP so that it is \nimpossible to track progress in the program. \no  Quarterly treatment reviews-Partial compliance \n•  All of the files had periodic Progress Reports conducted by multi \ndisciplinary teams. Some of these clearly focused on SBTP issues. \nHowever, the more problems a ward has, the less space is devoted to goals \nrelated to the SBTP. \n•  Development of Behavioral Management System-Partial compliance \n•  It appears that a new Incentive Program has been developed for the entire \ndepartment and that the staff is currently being trained in this system. \nHowever, there is no documentation on how this is being implemented. \n•  Implementation of policies-Not in compliance \no  Signed releases-Not in compliance \n5 \n\n•  \"'1ere was no evidence that the prograrr  'rticipants are being infonned \n~Jout confidentiality or about the pros mill cons of the participating in the \nprogram. \no  Termination process follows policies-Not in compliance \n•  Since there are no policies specific to the SBTP, there are no specific \ntennination policies. I did review the files of several wards who had been \nterminated. Some of these participants had been put on contracts before \nbeing terminated and others had not. \no  Completion of program based on established standards-Not in compliance \n•  I attended groups in which a number of participants who were being \ndischarged imminently were in attendance. Some of the participants had \nmade significant progress in treatment but other participants had only been \nin treatment for a matter of weeks. \n•  Prerelease \no  Prerelease package prepared by parole officer-Not in compliance \n•  Although I observed a parole officer making prerelease plans with a \nprogram participant, r did not see any prerelease plans in the records. \no  Assistance in establishing support system-Not in compliance \n•  Although I overheard contact being made with a support member, I did not \nsee written documentation of similar contacts in any records although \nreference to this may have been included in narrative notes. \n..  Healthy Sexuality Program (The Sex Behavior Task Force has set a deadline of January, \n2006 for the development of this curriculum.) \no  Curriculum developed-Partial compliance \n•  It is my understanding that Dr. Cellini is working on this curriculum \no  Program implemented-See above. \n..  Staffing \no  Staff qualifications-Not in compliance \n•  Staff appear to be qualified, However, I was told that labor issues prevented \nme from reviewing resumes, even if redacted. \no  Staff training-\n•  Professional staff training-Currently being planned by the Task Force. \ns  A good deal of time is being devoted to identifying treatment needs \nby the SBTF. However, no concrete plans for trmning staff have \nbeen presented to me. The SBTF may be in the process of planning \nspecific trainings. \n•  Adjunct stafftrmning-Currently being planned by the Task Force. \n•  At this time there do not appear plans to provide this type of training \nwhich probably will not be developed until after the professional \nstaff is trained. \no  Staff supervision-Not in compliance \n•  Staff supervision appears to vary from institution to institution and to be \noffered to staff according to their discipline rather than as a treatment team \nfor the SBTP. \no  Hiring of the SBTP Program Coordinator-Partial compliance \n•  The position has been submitted to the Department of Budget and Finance. \n..  Aftercare Program-Not in compliance \n•  Inhouse parole agents coordinating with aftercare programs need to have \nadequate knowledge of these programs. \n6 \n\n•  ~ ~ ~ry little information could be obtaine - 'Jout these positions including \n\"hether a new RFP has been awarded anu what the particulars of the \nqualification of the providers are. \nISSUES: These issues reflect factors which need immediate attention and have been arranged in \norder of priority. \nWaiting List: In order as ascertain how effective the resources of the SBTP are being utilized, I \nneed information about the waiting list including how many wards are waiting to be transferred to \nInpatient Programs, how many ofthese wards needs specialized services, \nRecommendation \n\"  Provide waiting list as soon as possible. \nHiring ofP  rogram Coordinator: Many of the recommendations outlined below can best be \ntackled by a full time program coordinator. The recruitment and hiring of this individual should be \nfast tracked as current staff is overwhelmed by other duties. \nRecommendation: \n\"  A national search should be immediately undertaken for an expert in the field  treatment of \njuveniles with sexual behavior problems to serve as the Coordinator. \nTreatment Records:  One of the biggest concerns identified by the audit and probably one of the \nmost easily correctible aspects of the program is the lack of standardization and accessibility of the \nfiles. A file produced by a treatment program is the blueprint for treatment. It would be \nunthinkable for a patient to be treated by a health professional without ready access to that \npatient's file. The information therein drives the treatment. This should be equally true in the \nSBTP. \nThe staff must first develop a form which documents in an easily interpretable way the \nprogress that a participant has made in the steps in the program. I have attached several examples. \nThese must accessible to both the psychologists and the Youth Counselors. It must also relate to \nthe requirements for each step so that is clear not only what a participant has accomplished but \nwhat they need to accomplish and consequently exactly what they should be working at any point \nin time. \nThe record should clearly document what resource groups have been completed. This \nmight be best done by awarding certificates at the completion of each resource group. \nThe maintenance of the forms must be standardized. Currently each facility maintains files \nin different ways. Documentation needs to be maintained for participation in group therapy \nincluding core group and resource groups as well as individual therapy in a way which will assist \nthe treatment team to plan and administer therapy for each participant. Type of activity and the \nexact timing ofthat activity must be clearly noted. \nRecommendations: \n..  A clinical fiie containing all material relevant to the SBTP should be developed for each \nprogram participant which would contain legal and court documents related to the crime/s \nthe SORD and its score, psychological assessments, group notes from all groups as well a~ \nindividual therapy notes or summaries relevant to SBTP treatment. \n•  This file needs to be readily available to the SBTP team. \n..  This file needs to be consistent across institutions. \n..  This file should contain a document which clearly outlines the steps in the program and \ndocuments the participant's progress through these steps. \n7 \n\nAppropriate Housing  Programs: \nVJ \nThe plan states that the SBTP will be conducted in appropriate physical settings including \nappropriate facilities as well adequate physical space within those facilities. With the exception \nChade~jian Youth Correctional Facility, the other facilities housing the Inpatient Programs \nappeared to be adequate as far as appropriate security level and overall safety ofthe program \nparticipants .. However, many of the rooms in all of the institutions that I observed were extremely \ncrowded. \nI was quite concerned about the safety of the participants in the Inpatient SBTP at \nChaderjian. At the time of my first visit two participants had sustained broken bones within the \nSBTP housing unit in two months, At that time one of the perpetrators of the latest assault was still \nliving on the housing unit despite repeated requests to have him moved. On both visits the staff \nreported that the program participants are frequently assaulted or tormented by other residents \nwhen they go to school or other programs. Living in fear for their physical safety significantly \nimpairs the ability to participate in treatment. \nJuveniles who are convicted of committing sexual offenses are rarely in need of maximum \nsecurity confinement. They are rarely gang affiliated, aggressive towards their male peers or \nheavily involved in drugs. Those who have molested children tend to be very immature, socially \nisolated and passive. Furthermore the combination of individuals convicted of sex crimes with \nwards who have committed sexual assaults while incarcerated is inappropriate. Programs \naddressing juveniles with sexual behavior problems have not been developed to address the \nbasically criminal offender whose behavior is part of the imuate culture. The SBTP plan addresses \nthe development of specialized treatment for subpopulations such as this. I believe that every effort \nshould be made to move the SBTP to a more suitable facility. The fact that one is from Northern \nCalifornia should not necessitate being placed in a facility ill-suited to house treatment programs \nfor youths with sexual behavior problems. \nThe Department has been discussing whether program participants should be housed in \ndonns or in cell. .Having operated programs that had (1.) single cells (2.) double bunking, (3) six \nman rooms (4) open dorms of up sixty men, I believe that single cells and double cells are the least \ntherapeutic for this population. Individuals with sexual behavior problems tend to withdraw and \nisolate when under stress. Single cells facilitate this and also allow for the privacy in which to \nengage in deviant fantasy and behavior. Double cells provide the opportunity for roommates to act \nout sexually with each other. More communal housing including open dorms discourage isolating \nand sexual involvement between program participants. \nRecommendations: \n•  The Department should consider alternative housing for the SBTP rather than continuing to \noperate it within Chaderjian. \nTreatment Time: The plan submitted for the SBTP sets ambitious time schedules for the groups \n(Eg,Core groups are to run for three hours once a week and large groups are to run for two hours \ntwice a week). However, these treatment hours are not being consistently met. Additionally groups \ndo not have set meeting times. For example, at Chad the case workers could offer resource groups \nany time within a four hour time frame. Additionally groups appear to end when they \"run out of \nsteam\" rather than at specified times. Groups operate much more effectively when the time frame \nis clearly established and faithfully followed. Additionally it would appear to be difficult to \nschedule other activities when therapy groups do not follow a strict schedule.  It was noted that \ntherapeutic activities are frequently cancelled because other required activities interfere such as \nevaluations or case conferences .. However, if groups were always scheduled for certain hours, \nother meetings, case conferences, etc could be scheduled around them. \n8 \n\nRecommendations: \n•  Because there are not set times for the groups, it is difficult to evaluate whether there is \ncompliance with the hours required by the plan. \ne  Group notes need to include exact times that the group was in session. \nPolicies regarding ethics: Currently the staff ofihe SBTP are providing treatment without \nclarification on issues such as confidentiality and informed consent. The department needs to \nclarify how they will handle issues such as access to treatment records in connection with \ninvoluntary commitment proceedings so that appropriate release forms can be developed. \nRecommendations: \n•  Current policies do not adequately address issues of confidentiality and informed consent. \nThis places professional staff in the position of operating outside their own professional \nstandards. \n•  Legal staff needs to clarify these issues. \nCurriculum: There is a large manual which contains a standardized curriculum but without the \nnecessary handouts. These could be developed so that the curriculum would be useable. I have no \nproblem with the curriculums as they have been developed if they can be completed by adding the \nrequired participant materials and developing a handbook of experiential exercises that can be \nadded to curriculum. It has been my observation that many groups are not following any kind of \ncurriculum which neeessitates the youth counselor or the psychologist having to develop group \nmaterials at the last minute. This also leads to the lack of consistency which is very evident in the \nactivities. It also makes much extra work for the staff. \nRecommendations: \n•  The Task Force has set January, 2006 as the deadline for developing the curriculum \nincluding that for the Healthy Sexuality classes. This can be facilitated by using the \nexisting curriculum as a starting point. \nSttiff: Without exception, the program staff including the psychologists, parole agents and Youth \nCounselors were professional, caring and competent. These are primarily mature individuals who \nserve as ideal parental models and related to the wards in a supportive and encouraging manner. I \nwas able to observe a number of informal contacts as I was monitoring files and could conclude \nthat the wards related easily to the above staff. In the therapy sessions the leaders were \nencouraging and used positive reinforcement, appearing to be instinctively following the principles \nof Motivational Interviewing. \nThe staff appeared to be knowledgeable about the specific area they were presenting. It was \ndifficult to ascertain the breadth of expertise in sex offender treatment of any specific staff member \nbut each one seemed familiar with the topic they were presenting which included Relapse \nPrevention and Criminal Thinking Errors as well as a general casework group and a large group. \nHowever, the staff also consistently expressed a desire for more training in the area. \nThe clinieal staff also reported widely ranging knowledge and support of the Sexual \nBehavioral Treatment Program Plan. They all requested additional training. \nAlthough the staff appeared to be qualified, I was not provided with staff resumes despite \nrequesting them prior to the audit and at the exit interview, I have only received one. Therefore the \nDepartment caunot be credited with complying with this factor. \nRecommendations: \n9 \n\ne  The Task Force is currently making plans for training the staff. I need to be informed of \nthese plans as soon as possible. \n•  It is recommended that the Task Force contact Dr. Steve Bengis of NEARl Publishing in \nHolyoke, Massachusetts (sbengisial,aol.com) who is developing a multimedia training \nprogram on treating juveniles with inappropriate sexual behavior. \nAssessment: The instrument that is currently being used does not have demonstrated reliability or \nvalidity. The Department has the opportunity to participate in the norming of both a risk \nassessment, the J-SOAP-15, and an assessment packet, the Matrix. Both of the authors are \nrequesting that contact with the Department. \nAlthough a standardized assessment protocol has not been developed, the Task Force is \nactively working on selecting the instruments and format. \nI did review a number of very well done psychological evaluations done by institutional \npsychologists for a variety of different reasons. \nRecommendations: \n•  The Department immediately needs to contact Dr. Robert Prentky (Justice Resource \nInstitute 63 Main St Bridgewater, MA 02360) regarding participation in the norming of the \nJ-SOAP. \n•  The Task Force should contact Dr. Moccia-Fonsekia of Sexual Dynamics in San Diego or \nDr.Rassmussen of the University of San Diego School of Social Work. in regards to the \ndevelopment ofthe Matrix. \nOutpatient Treatment: Although staff of the Inpatient SBTP has been involved in the Task Force, \nwith the exception of the female program at Ventura, the  staff who will conduct the outpatient \nSBTP have not been involved. These institutions need to be part of the planning program so that \nthey will be ready to implement these programs in a timely manner. \nRecommendations: \n•  Representatives from the SBTP need to meet with the administration of the facilities which \nwill house the Outpatient Treatment Programs to introduce them to what will be expected \nof their staff. \n•  As soon as possible representatives of these facilities should be involved in the Task Force. \nAftercare Treatment: The staff of the SBTP needs to acquire information about the treatment \nprograms being offered through the Parole Department. \nRecommendations: \n•  Details regarding the aftercare programs for juveniles with sexual behavior problems need \nto be obtained including qualifications of the vendors and of the specific therapists. \nInquiries about this audit may be directed to me at the above address. \na  '\" \nRes);\\ectfu~~ submitted{!

The WDP Coordinators' monthly repolis \nrequired by the remedial plan have been prepared for the first  time for April, 2006, although J would recommend that the current format be expanded to \ninclude  more  information on the services actually provided to  wards \\vith disabilities, as  \\vell as information on wards with disabilities  grievances and \ndisciplinary actions, and those placed in restrictive settings. \nStaff Assistantsfor Wards with Disabilities \nThe \\VDP Remedial Plan requires 1he  establishment of staff assistants at each  faci1it~\\ for the purpose of assuring that reasonable 3ccommodalions arc \nprovided to wards during disciplinary and grin'ance procedures, Board hearings, parole planning, and other specified activities.  Since about Fehruary.': 2006, \nthese groups have typically been set up at the facilities, and while thcrc have been few instances of actual assistance, this facet of the remedial plan appears to \nbe proceeding in a positive direction. \nI ADA Righ~s Notification and Ward Orientation  .  .  .'  .. ,  '  ,  , .  \nI The \\'vards  ADA RIghts i'iotlficatlOn Form has been updated and IS 111 nse at the three Illlake faclhUes,  It IS beheved that wards arc properly adVised of their \nrights and  understand the basics  of these rights,  although  a morc detailed orientation is  still needed,  The WDP Remedial Plan  requires that an  ADA \norientation componcnt be dewloped and presented to all wards at one of the reception centers.  While a Power Point presentation has been developed, I would \nI \nrecommend that ]\\1s.

While there was one difficult situation involving a deaf ward \nencountered at one facility (a sihration not specifically caused by the Dn), the appropriate actions seem to have been taken and the mal1er resolved. \nADA Staff Training \nThe WDP Remedial Plan requires that an outside agency conduct a needs assessment for staff training by June 30_ 2006_  California State University Chico \nhas prepared a basic outline for  how the training should  be developed; howcver,  it  is  unclear  who will prepare the  final  course curriculum_  I would \nrecommend that a disability advocacy agency be consulted, as required by the remedial plan, to assist in developing the final curriculum e1emenls; including \nthose related to sensitivity training; discrimination, and hara5sment \nCoordination with Special ~f/ork Groups lllld other Remedial Plan..,\" \nThe WDP Remedial Plan has a number of activities that require this type of coordination, but with no specific schedule for implcmentation_  These required \nactivities  include:  (1)  a  special  educational  \\vorking  group  to  make  recommendations  regarding  improvements  to  rEP  accommodations  and  parent \nparticipation, (2) a special working group to study and provide recommendations for residential programs for wards with developmental disabilities, (3) \neoordination with those working on the health eare remedial plan to document the inclusion of several spccific items for wards with disabilities, (4) a special \nworking group and coordination with the mental health experts to study the effects of celiain psychotropic drugs on wards, and (5) coordination with safety \nand welfare issues for wards with disabilities, as they would relate to and be included in the safety and welfare remedial phm.  To date, only the working group \ndescrihed in (I) ahove has occuned, and this group is proceeding expeditiously to resolve the outstanding issues_  I would rccommend that the other groups \ni \nand coordinating activities be set up to occur as soon as possible. \nEdlicationalIsSlies for Wards with Disabilities \nThere is a degree of overlap between the requirements of the WDP Remedial Plan and the Educational Services Rcmedial Plan, partieularly in the area of \neducational serviees for wards with disabilities enrol1ed in special education programs.  The group of three experts has attempted to coordinate monitoring \nactivities in these areas.  The educational experts have raised the issue of reduced school days at several facilities; and since many wards \\vith disahilities are \nhoused in special treatment or restrictive programs, this situation tends to negatively affect educational services for these wards to a significant degree_  I \nwould recommend that remedial  strategies developed by the educational experts be implemented to  improve the numher of hours of instruction.  Also, \nmonitoring activities indicated some consistent problems in the preparation of high school graduation plans and individualized education plans (lEPTs), and I \nwould recommend al1ention to the requirements of the WDP Remedial Plan, such as the use of staff advocates during [EP meetings, to resolve these issues_ \nWIN Informlltion Systems \nDuring the year since the approval of the WDP Remedial Plan, the DJJ has worked steadily to upgrade its computerized ward record-kceping system, referred \nto as the WIN  system_  The remedial plan requires that various types of information about wards with disabilities,  including the nature of any disabling \n'[  condition and any reasonable accommodations necessary to pro\\'ide ser\\'ices and programs to a specific ward, be readily available to all staff  \\Vhile there \\,yas \nI \nno specific time line for having the sys1el11 ready and available for usc, it was inherent that perfecting the system would take some time.  I believe thM the D.T.T \nI \nhas made reasonable progress to this end, but would also recommend that the required items ofinfonnation relating to \\vards with disabilities that are currently \navailable Cit .... iS llnderstood t~1at s..  omc items l~el:]ted to c~aSSificatio. .n .  a.r~ l~ot yet ~esolved in the safety t.l11.d welfare remedial plan) be incorporated into the \\VIN \nl. s~~stem_ ~nd ~hat staff b~e traIne~d to access thIS 1.\"!2f?!.~::!a1~on- as ~~1~_~.~_~~~].?J:~raCt1C31.  ,_ ... ~.~~_. ____ ._._..  _._.~ __ ._ ______ ._._._. ___ ._ _ ._ ___________________i  \nMay 31,2006  Page 2 of35 \n\nCALIFORNIA DEPARnlE~T OJ;' Jt:VENILE JuSTICE  Wards with Disabilities Program Remedial Plan \nAnnual Auditor's Report \nI Facility Com p lia~~~c~Ch~rt~~---------\n, This~hart repres~nTs the eomhiJ1ed-;-;;d;t;~g~er;;,if:;'rthe-ficol-rs-t-r-o-un-d-;-of site visits to the eight DJJ correctional facilities and headquarters by the Disabilit,es \nI \nAuditor, Logan Hopper.

Introd Iletion \nBackground \nDuring December 2002, Mr. Stephen Acquisto, Deputy Attorney General, California Department of \nJustice contacted Dr. Tom O'Rourke and Dr. Robert Gordon to conduct a review oftbe California Youth \nAuthority educational program with two objectives:  I) to evaluate the CY A general and special \neducation programs based on thirteen areas of inquiry; and 2) to provide specitlc comments and \nrecommendations regarding the current status of the educational program in each of the areas of review. \nThe OJ] Education Branch used the findings of this review and other information to develop the \ncducation section of the Consent Decree Remediation Plan (dated March 1,2005). There were six major \nsections in the Education Services Remedial Plan: \nI.  Overview, Philosophy, and Program Policy \nII.  Staffing \nIII.  Student Access and Attendance \nIV.  Curriculum \nV.  Special Education I Record Keeping \nVI.  Access to State Mandated Assessments \nReview Process: \nTbe Consent Decree required that a specific monitoring process for tbe Education Services Remedial Plan \nbe establisbed and implemented that directly monitored and measured compliance with and progress \ntowards meeting implementation of decree requirements by the CY A,  Dr. Tom O'Rourke and Dr. \nRobert Gordon were asked to develop standards for monitoring and to conduct site visits using a \nstandardized monitoring instrument. \nThe reviewers conducted site visits during the period of September 2005 through March 2006 to the \nfollowing OJJ schools: \nDJ.J High School  DJ.J Youth Correctional Facility \nlames A. Wieden High School  Preston Y Duth Correctional Facility & \n& Sacramento Parole School  Sacramento Parole \nlohanna Boss High School  O. H. Close Youth Correctional Facility \nDeWitt Nelson High School  De Witt Nelson Training Center \nN. A. Chadetjian High School  N. A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility \nMarie C. Romero High School  EI Paso de Robles Youth Correctional Facility \nMary B. Perry High School  Ventura Youth Correctional Facility \nLyle Egan High School  Heman G. Stark Youth Correctional Facility \nlack B. Clarke High School  Southern Youth Correctional Reception and Center Clinic \n•  Initial visits were announccd and communicated to tbe Education Services branch and the sites being \nvisited. \n•  Each of the facilities was provided with copies of the Education Services Remedial Plan and copies \nof the monitoring instrument that was based on the six (6) major areas of the plan. \n1 \n\n•  Each cducation site was reviewed for compliance with the specific items noted in the Remedial Plan \nusing the standardized monitoring instrument. \n•  A four-part approach was used by the reviewers to obtain information in order to monitor progress \ntoward compliance with the Consent Decree: \n1) Review of system level written materials (e.g., W ASC reports, DJJ policies, annual reports, \nschool improvement plans, school site plans, course standards, course guides, lesson plans, course \nsyllabi, Special Education Manual, and other supporting documents); \n2) Review of site generated data, including special education records, individual student [EPs, \nattendance data, school closing data, special management unit documents, class rolis, school \nschedules, high school graduation plans, psychological evaluations and other educational reports \nand documents; \n3) Interviews with central office administrators, site based administrators, counselors, teachers, \nyouth and other support staff; and \n4) Observations of classroom activities, ward movement, and special management programs, \nincluding mental health and other restricted programs. \nThe written materials reviewed provided data collected since the beginning of the 2005/2006 school \nyear.  Interviews with educational personnel provided staff perceptions of the strengths and needs of \nthe education program. Analysis of this information, together with direct observations, resulted in a \nseries oftindings regarding compliance with the requirements of the consent decree in the areas of \ngeneral and special education. \nFindings \nAt the conclusion of each review, an exit conference was conducted. The reviewers met with the site \nadministrators and provided verbal feedback regarding the general findings of the audit.  No written \ndocumentation or report was provided to the site at the exit conference. \nA written Site Compliance Report was provided by the reviewers to Special Master, Donna Brorby within \n30 days afthe site visit.  Special Master Brorby then submitted copies of the repOlt to representatives of \nplaintiffs and defendants. \nOn the Site Compliance Reports, findings on each item reviewed consisted of a compliance rating and \nspecific written comments supporting the rating. The report used the following compliance ratings: \nSubstantial Compliance (as defined in Consent Decree )-\"if any violations ofthe relevant \nremedial plan are minor or occasional and are neither systemic nor seriousl> \nPartial Compliance - elements of the remedial plan compliance are evident, but not to a \nsufficient degree to meet the standard of substantial compliance \nNon-compliance-compliance is not evident andlor the level of compliance does not meet \nminimal requirements of the remedial plan \n2 \n\nBecause arthe relatively brief time involved in the actual site reviews, the reports are limited in their \nability to provide ongoing descriptions and should be utilized as only one source of information for \nindicating progress by the DJ] titcilities towards meeting consent decree requirements. \nContent of the Summary Education Program Report: \nThe content of this report is in three parts: \n1.  Jntrocli,lclLQu,background on the development of the Education Services Remedial \nPlan, its inclusion in the Consent Decree and the methodology of the Remedial Plan \nrevlCW process \n1I.  ~1Imlll:l[yB.J:l)Or\\s - reports indicating the compliance ratings on specific items in the \nRemedial Plan for the system as a whole and for each school program reviewed. \nIlL  Major Recommendations - statements regarding areas needing improvement in order \nto achieve compliance with the requirements of the Consent Decree. \n3 \n\nSection n. Summary Reports \nThe summaries of the reviewers' findings are fOllnd in two (2) attached tables: \nAttachment A  California Education Services Remedial Plan Summary Report \n(I. Overview, Philosophy, and Program Policy. n. Staffing, \nIll. Student Access and Attendance, IV. Curriculum, V. Special \nEducation, VI.California High School Exit Exam.) \nAttacom£nt A The first column on the table lists spec inc items selected from the Remedial Plan \nin each of the six areas.  The middle column specines the auditing method, describing which \napproaches (e.g., tlle review, interview, or observation) will be used to determine compliance \nwith each part of the item. In the last column, the findings from the eight (8) site reviews are \nsummarized to provide a system wide picture of compliance levels. \nAttachment B  California Remedial Plan Site Compliance Report \n(I. Overview, Philosophy, and Program Policy, n. Staffing, Ill. Student \nAccess and Attendance, IV. Curriculum, V. Special Education, VI. \nCalifornia High School Exit Exam.) \nAttachment.!.i  On this table, the name of each site and the date of its review is shown at the top \nof the column. The items reviewed are listed by each of the six (6) areas and the compliance \nrating for each item (substantial, partial or non compliance) is shown. \n4 \n\nSection III. Major Recommendations \nThcse recommendations are made by the reviewers to assist the Division of Juvenile Justice in attaining \nfull compliance with the Consent Decree requiremcnts.  They are organized according to the six areas in \nthe Education Serviccs Rcmedial Plan. \nI. Ove.-view, Philosophy & Program Policy \nRemetiial Plan:  The CY AICEA is required to develop a high school graduation plan and enroll each non \ngraduate student in an appropriate education program (W&  1 Code 1120.1) \n•  There continues to be a failure to provide enough courses on a consistent basis to comply with \nthis requirement. While more High School Graduation Plans are being developed, students are \nnot making substantial progress in meeting high school graduation requirements. \nRemedial Plan:  Students are prepared for successful re-integration into the community. \n•  Students are not being provided adequate transition planning at all sites.  Schools must provide \nspecific guidance and direction to prepare students for successful release into the community. \nn. Staffing \nRe_medial Plan:  Each high school has adequate credentialed staff to provide instruction in content area \ncourses needed for graduation. \n•  Current staffing allocations need revision due to the changes in population at many sites.  Staffing \nallocations need to ensure that there are enough credentialed core area faculty to meet the \nstudents' high school graduation plan requirements. \n•  An increased number of available substitute teachers (meeting the 15% relief factor) is needed to \nprcvent class cancellations due to teacher absences.  Options need to be explored to provide \nqualified substitute teachers in both general and special education. \n•  Continued attention should be given to the teacher recruitment and hiring process. While staff \nrecruiters have been identified, a comprehensive plan to recruit and retain qualified education \nstaff is still needed.  DJ] Central Office should take steps to reduce the lengthy delay between an \neducation vacancy occurring and the position being t1l1ed. \nHI. Student Access and Attendance \nReI11edial tilitJLAlI eligible students wiJ] have access to any educational programs and supplemental \nservices necessary to ensure successful completion of all high school, vocational, and life skills courses. \n•  Students who arc not making progress towards the high school diploma should be provided better \naccess to GED programs.  This access should include pre-GED instruction, test preparation and \nother strategies to promote successtld acquisition of a GED certificate.  Increased GED \n5 \n\nopportunities would provide motivation for students 18 and older, not likely to meet high school \ndiploma requirements, to attend school. \n•  Despite what appears to be adequate vocational facilities, too few students are participating in \nvocational classes.  All students must be offered vocational training to provide them with \nemployment skills to prepare them to re-enter the community. \nRemedial Plan: An effective and fully functional School Consultation Team will provide instructional \nservices for students experiencing problems of an academic, social and behavioral nature. \n•  Schools lack unif(lflnity in the implementation ofthe SCT. The SCT process should be monitored \nat the Central Office and site levels to ensure uniform implementation. \nRemedial Plan: A collaborative memorandum of understanding will be developed by the Directors at each \nsite and signed by each affected Branch Deputy Director delineating a collaborative effort between \ncustody, education and treatment to ensure equal student access to all programs. \n•  The written agreement described in the consent decree does not exist and must be developed \nimmediately. While many reasons were otfered at the sites, the fact remains that students are \nsimply not being sent to school on a regular basis. All parties (education, custody and treatment) \nmust come together to ensure all students are receiving education services. \n•  All options should be explored to ensure student access to instruction. One option is to expand the \nschool day from 4 to 5 or 6 periods, with time set aside for prescribed counseling conducted at the \nschool site.  Education statf should study the feasibility of incorporating mental health services \ninto curriculum that would allow students to earn elective course credit. The mental health \ncounselor and teacher could work as a team to teach these classes. If teaming is not possible, the \ntime could be used by the counselor to meet with the students at the school during one or more of \nthe six available school hours. \n•  If counseling services were provided at the school facility, student movement time would be \nreduced, increasing the amount of available instructional and clinical time. \nRemedial Plan: In order to make satisfactory progress toward high school graduation students must be \nprovided and attend school a minimum of 240 minutes daily. \n•  Student absentee rates continue to be unacceptable. Strategies outlined in the remedial plan to \nimprove school attendance must be implemented at both the Central Office and site levels (e.g., \npolicy and procedure to eliminate class cancellations, cooperative agreements, plans to remediate \ndeticient attendance, and attendance incentives). \nRel]1edial Plan: Students in restricted settings will have the same school day as students in the regular \nschool program. \n•  Instructional programs for both regular and special education students in the restricted settings are \ninadequate. Additional staff and instructional space must be identified and provided in order to \nprovide equal educational access to these students. \n6 \n\nIV. Curriculum \n.RcmedL~l])lan: Career technical education programs should be implemented and employability studies \nconducted to determine how well students are transitioning back to the community. \n•  A feedback loop should be developed by Central Office staff so that each site can determine \nwhether students are being successfully employed once they return to the community. Vocational \nprogram effectiveness and necessary changes should be based on this information. \nRemedial Plan: Educational technology and distance education should be added at all sites to add a wide \nrange of learning modalities and enhance the curriculum. \n•  Central Ofllce staff should emphasize the expanded use of technology to enhance the school \ncurriculum. \n•  Distance learning technology should be made available in the restricted units. Central ofllce and \nsite staff should pursue this avenue ttl[ increasing educational service hours without \ncompromising security for students segregated from the general population. \nRemedial Plan: Teacher observations are an integral part in evaluation of the delivery and quality of the \neducational program. \n•  School administrators must consistently conduct quarterly classroom observations to document \nevidence of instructional planning. use of course syllabi and delivery of the state approved \ncurriculum. Observations should be based on the rubric for classroom observation aligned with \nthe California Standards for the Teacher Profession (CSTP) \nV. Special Education \nRemedial Plan: The Special Education Manual will meet all state and federal regulations. \n•  DJJ Central office staff should continue to update the current Special Education Manual to \ninclude changes mandated by recent IDEA revisions and No Child Left Behind legislation. \nRemedial Plan: Complete special education files are required to be transferred to the receiving DJ] \nfacility and fully implemented within 4 school days of student's arrival. \n•  The system for requiring receipt of complete educational records should be revised to ensure that \nall students entering the DJ] system li'om the community or who transfer from One facility to \nanother are accompanied by complete records. \nRemedial Plan: Each DJ] facility must provide a continuum of placement options, including the full rauge \nof time, frequency and duration within each option. \n•  All sites must improve the provision of general education classes in the frequency and duration \nindicated in IEPs.  Teacher vacancies at many sites resulted in reductions and limitations on class \nofferings.  The practice of holding studeuts on their units for reasons not allowed under the \nconsent decree must be discontinued so that special education students have aCCess to IEP \nmandated segments. \n7 \n\nRemedi~l Plan: The DJ.) school sites are responsible for ensuring that a continuum of available special \neducation services is provided to all eligible students including those assigned to restricted settings. \n•  Most special education students whether served in the main school program or on the residential \nunits do not receive 240 minutes of instruction daily.  The practice of providing minimal special \neducation services and little or no access to the general education program must be corrected \nimmediately. \nRemedial Plan: Eligible students receive the required number of IEP segments and a full instructional \nday. \n•  IFPs written by DJJ staff must address how the student's disability affects involvement in the \ngencral curriculum.  When the IEP requires access to the general curriculum, such access and a \nfull school day must be provided. Supplemental aids and program modifications that support the \nstudent's involvement in the general curriculum must be provided. \nRemedial Plan: Written policies, procedures and practice require that assessment procedures and products \nprovided by the DJJ be updated and standardized by August 2005. \n•  Program administrators at the Central OtTice and sites must monitor not only the completion of \nreports but also take responsibility for accuracy and time line expectations to ensure quality \ncontrol. \nRemedial Plan: Written policy, procedures, and practice require that the CY A and clinic administrators \nwill work collaboratively with Intake and Court Service units to ensure compliance with regulations \nregarding the provision of lEI's prior to the acceptance of the physical custody of the student. \n•  Collaborative agreements between clinic administrators and intake and comi service units \nregarding IEPs of incoming students must be developed and implemented immediately. \nRemedi'!ll'lm): Special education students were provided services according to requirements of pre \nexisting valid lEI's. \n•  If specified in the student's pre-existing IEI', DJ] schools must provide students with access to a \nfull instructional day. Any IEP change must be made with adequate documentation or rationale \nand by the IEP committee. \nRemedial Plan: When there is no IEP, special education eligibility will be determined and team meetings \nwill be held in a timely manner. Required participants will be in attendance. IFP notices are sent as \nrequired and required participants are present. If regular education teachers are not there, ensure that they \nare made aware of IEP provisions. \n•  Special education eligibility documents must be kept current according to guidelines. Expired or \nofftimeline IEPs cannot support continued eligibility and must be reviewed by the IEP team. \n8 \n\ncompliance efforts should be conducted independently by each Assistant Principal responsible for \nspecial education programming. \nVI. California High School Exit Exam \nRemedial Plan: Each eligible student in the DJJ shall have access to each mandated educational \nassessment. \n•  It is rccommended that sites make better use of data from the statewide testing program to focus \non specific goals in each individual school improvement plan. \n•  There is a need to cxplore and provide all options possible to youth who are unable to pass the \nequivalency exams. \n10 \n\n•  IEI' meetings must be held within the prescribed time frame and documentation must be \nmaintained indicating that regular education teachers not present at the IFP meetings were madc \naware of the IEI' provisions for students in their classes. \nRemedial PI\"ll: Special education files must include consideration of need for related serviees and/or \ntransition planning. \n•  In the development of special education transition plans, there is a need to emphasize and/or \ndocument the acquisition of functional skills and hands-on- knowledge that would enable the \nstudent to re-enter the community and continue education or training as required. III the IEPs \nreviewed at all sites, transition goal outcomes were vague and not measurable. Teachers at all \nsites are aware of transition plan limitations and expressed optimism that form revisions expected \nas a result of the new IDEA requirements would enable them to address this deficiency. \nContinued training and more intensive monitoring by the school administration and central office \nstaff is recommended. \nRemedial Plan: The CY A shall develop and implement a system to provide for the documentation of \nstudent progress related to his/her IEI' goals and objectives based on the dates identified on the IEP.  The \nsystem will ensure that progress reviews are routinely practiced by each special education provider. \n•  Teachers must documcnt progress review ofIEP benchmarks and wherc necessary, make IEP \nchanges based on progress or lack of progress. Consistent monitoring of this process by the site \nAssistant Principal and Regional Program Specialist is recommended. \nRemedial PI\",.D.: Written policy, procedures, and practice require that compensatory special education \nservices are provided to students if significant gaps of missed service occur or are projected to occur, and \nif such services cannot be made up during the course of the wcek or designated period of time. \n•  A need for compensatory services is created by extended teacher absences and/or unfilled \nteaching positions not covered by snbstitute teachers.  Lengthy school hold backs by the \nresidence halls create compensatory obligations that have not been addressed.  Personnel at the \nCentral Office and sites must address these issues. \nRemedial Plan: Training on special education will be provided by the CY A to all education staff and \nadministrators, treatment and cnstody staff and administrators and other stakeholders starting July 2005. \nTraining will use the approved Special Education Manual, approved forms and data collection systems. \nThe frequency of the training scheduled will be dependent on each individual's role in the process and \nmay vary from quarterly to annually. \n•  Whilc the sites have been able to document their staff training, there is concern about the \neffectiveness of the training dne to the many deficiencies in meeting consent decree requirements. \nTraining staff should carefully examine their efforts and develop formal methods of measuring \nimplementation of special education training objectives. \nRemedial Plan: The Regional Program Specialist shall conduct at least quarterly site reviews of each \nschool's special education compliance etlorts and status. \n•  The Regional Program Specialists did not begin conducting quarterly site reviews at each school \nuntil midyear.  The Specialists must ensure that they are monitoring the program's compliance in \neach special education area covered by the consent decree.

      "text": "\n############# New Text on 20240731 ###############\n    \nOffice  of the  5) pn ecial  Master,  Measuring \nIncidence  of  Violence:  R eport  of  Findings \nSeptember  2006\n  \nMeasuring  DJJ  Incidence  of  Violence:  Report  of Findings \nMonitor  Cathleen  Beltz \nSeptember  2006 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe  purpose  of the  analysis  is  to  establish  a  baseline  count  of incidents  of violence \nacross  the  eight  operating  DJJ  facilities,  excluding  camps,  for  two  six  month  periods  from \nJanuary  through  June  2005  and  January  through  June  2006.  DJJ  compiles  summary  data  for \nuses  of force  and  serious  incidents  as  they  are  reported  by  facilities.  However,  these  reports \ndo  not  purport  to  reflect  all  incidents  of violence.  Currently,  there  is  no  consistent  tracking \nand  summarizing  system  in  place  for  incidents  of violence  not  recorded  in  serious  incident  or \nuse  of force  reports.  Documentation  of youth  disciplinary  actions  (DDMS)  related  to  violence \nin  DJJ  facilities  is  tracked  and  summarized  regularly.  However,  DDMS  summaries  count \nindividuals  involved  rather than  number  of actual  incidents.  For  example,  three  youth \nengaged  in  a mutual  fight  is  summarized  as  three  separate  incidents  (one  disciplinary  action \nfor  each  youth  involved)  rather  than  one  fight  involving  three  youth.  Relying  solely  on \nDDMS  summary  data  for  incidents  of institutional  violence  would  result  in  inflated  counts. \nEvery  DJJ  facility  maintains  daily  records  of incidents of violence  and  other \nnoteworthy  events  in  supervisor  log  books  and/or  Daily  Operational  Security  Reports  (“daily \noperational  reports”).  Generally,  facility  staff record  incidents  as  they  occur  on  units  and \nfacility  grounds.  These  incidents  are  summarized  on  site  in  the  form  of daily  operational \nreports  and/or  kept  in  log  books  that  facilities  archive.  Log  books  and  daily  operational \nreports  also  contain  information  about uses  of force  (including  secure  area  extractions), \ninjuries  to  staff and  youth,  suicidal  or  disruptive  behavior  as  well  as  daily  facility  population \nand  movement.  Current  DJJ  policy  does  not  require  specific  daily  operational  or  log  book \nreporting  and,  as  a  result,  there  is  variation  in  reporting  practices  between  facilities.\nHeadquarters  indicates  that  facility  staff attempt  to  record  all  incidents  of institutional \nviolence  in  daily  operational  reports  or  log  books,  which  makes  them  the  most  comprehensive \nsource  for  these  data  currently  available.  For  this  analysis,  data  collection  was  limited  to \ninformation  that  ss  reported  consistently  across  facilities.  However,  variation  in  reporting \npractices  necessarily  affects  the  accuracy  of this  count  and  should  be  considered  in  drawing \nconclusions.  | \nThe  monitor  received  copies  of typewritten  daily  operational  reports  for  eight  DJJ \nfacilities  for  the  first  six  months  of 2005  and  2006.  Because  Stark  does  not  input  daily \noperational  information  to  a  computer,  institutional  violence  data  for  2005  was  coded  and \ninput  from supervisor  log  books  at  the  facility  in  Chino.  For  the  2006  data,  DJJ  provided \ncopies  of relevant  pages  from  the  supervisor  log  book.  O.H.  Close  provided  a  complete  set  of \ndaily  operational  reports  for  the  periods  requested.  For  the  remaining  facilities,  there  were \nsome  missing  days  and/or  shifts  as  noted  in  Attachment  A. \nTo  examine  the  frequency  of serious  incident  reporting  for  various  types  of incidents \nof violence  occurring  in  DJJ  facilities  for the  two  time  periods  analyzed,  the  monitor  reviewed \ncopies  of all  serious  incident  reports  as  well  as  DJJ  serious  incident  report  summaries  for  the \ntwo  periods.  DJJ  provided  a total  of 527  reports.  However,  DJJ  serious  incident  report \nsummaries  for  the  same period  show a total  of 573  serious  incidents,  a  difference  of 46 \nreports.  For  the  2005  period,  DJJ  provided  51  fewer  serious  incident  reports  than  summaries \nreflect.  However,  for  the  2006  period,  DJJ  provided  5  more  serious  incidents  reports  than \nsummaries  indicate.'  The  initial  objective  of identifying  ail  serious  incidents  reported  could \nnot  be  accomplished  for  this  report  given  the  discrepancies  described.  However,  trends  in \n  \n'  See  Attachment B  for serious  incident reports  provided  and  DJJ  Serious  Incident Report  Summaries. \n2\nserious  incident  reporting  at  each  facility  may  be  gleaned  from  serious  incident  reports \nprovided. \nMETHODS \nThe  data  source  for  the  analysis  includes:  (1)  daily  operational  reports  for  seven  DJJ \nfacilities  including,  N.A.  Chaderjian  Youth  Correctional  Facility  (“Chaderjian”),  Dewitt \nNelson  Youth  Correctional  Facility  (“Dewitt”),  El  Paso  De  Robles  Youth  Correctional \nFacility  (“Paso  Robles’),  O.H.  Close  Youth  Correctional  Facility  (O.H. Close”),  Preston \n  \nYouth  Correctional  Facility  (“Preston”),  Southern  Youth  Correctional  Reception  Center  and \nClinic  (Southern Clinic”)  and  Ventura Youth  Correctional  Facility  (“Ventura”)  for  two  six \nmonth  periods  from J anuary  through  June  2005  and  January  through  June  2006;  (2)  Stark \nfacility  supervisor’s  log  book  for  January  through  June  2005  and  2006;  (3)  serious  incident \nreports  provided  for  the  same  facilities  and  time  periods; and  (4)  monthly  population  data  for \nJanuary  through  June  2005  and  January  through  June  2006.  Incidents  were  recorded  using \nSPSS  data  analysis  software.  A  total  of nine  (9)  items  were  recorded including,  “facility,” \n \n“vear,” 33004 “month,”  “date,”  “time  of incident,” vt  46 “type  of incident,” oo  a8 “use  of force,” 37  ae “serious \nincident  report”  and  “gang  related.” \nThe  “facility”  item  indicates  at which  facility  incidents  occur. \nThe  “year,” 73  46 “month,”  “date”  and  “time  of incident”  items  are  recorded  for  purposes  of \nidentifying  incidents  for  specific  periods. \nThe “time  of incident”  item  is  recorded  as  it  appears  in  copies  of daily  operational \nreports  provided.  Where  daily  operational  reports  provided  do  not  indicate times  of incidents, \nno  time  is  recorded. \nThe  “gang  related”  item  includes  incidents  identified  as  gang  related  in  serious \nincident  reports.  Daily  operational  report  entries  for  most  facilities  often  indicate  that  gang \nactivity  is  a  likely  cause  of many  incidents  of violence.  However,  because  reporting  practices \nvary and  not  all  gang  involvement  is  noted,  serious  incident  reports  are  the  only  identifier  of \ngang  related  activity  recorded  for  this  analysis. \nThe  “type of incident”  item  includes  the  following  categories: \n¢  NFI  (“not  following  instructions’ |  or  other  disruptive  behavior  --includes  incidents \nnot  involving contact  between  youth  and  staff that  result  in  staff use  of force.  Among \nitems  included  in  this  category  are  incidents  of not  following  instructions,  damaging  or \nattempting  to  damage  state  property,  rough  playful  behavior,  attempted  batteries  and \ngassings,  self-injurious  behavior  not  identified  as  attempted  suicides  in  daily \noperational reports  or  serious  incident  reports,  and  defiant  or  otherwise  disruptive \n \nbehavior.  Incidents  of “NFI  or  other  disruptive  behavior”  are  only  significant  in \nrelation to  use  of force  data  recorded  in  daily  operational  reports  (see  discussion \nbelow). \n®  one-on-one  --includes  all  fights  between  two  youth  without  regard  to  whether  use  of \nforce  was  indicated.  This  ttem  only  includes  incidents  where  physical  contact  was \nmade  and  excludes  rough  playful  behavior. \n¢  2  or  more-on-one--  includes  reported  attacks  of two  or  more  youth  on  one  youth \nvictim  without  regard  to  whether  use  of force  was  indicated.  This  item  only  includes \nincidents  where  physical  contact  was  made  and  excludes  rough  playful  behavior. \n#  3-or-more  --includes  reported  mutuai  fights  between  three  or  more  youth,  where \ncontact  was  made,  without  regard  to  whether  use  of force  was  indicated.  This  item \nexcludes  rough  playful  behavior. \ne  Group  Disturbance  --includes reported  mutual  fights,  where  contact  was  made, \nwithout  regard  to  whether  use  of force  was  indicated.  This  item  includes  all  incidents \nidentified  as  “multiples”  or  “group  disturbances”  in  daily  operational  reports  or \ncorresponding  serious  incident reports  and  excludes  rough  playful  behavior. \nStaff Battery--  includes  all  reported  batteries  on  staff where  contact  was  made,  without \nregard  to whether  use  of force  was  indicated,  that  are  recorded  in  daily  operational \nreports  or  corresponding  Serious  incident  reports.  This  item  includes  incidents  where \nyouth,  in  resisting  restraint,  injured  staff through  direct  physical  contact.  This  item \nalso  includes  the  few  cases  involving  spraying  of liquids  other  than bodily  fluids  that \nmade  contact  with  staff clothing  or  skin.  Where  corresponding  serious  incident \nreports  were  provided, daily  operational  reports  entries  were  supplemented  and  data \nwas  coded  accordingly. \nStaff Gassing--  includes  all  batteries  on  staff with  bodily  fluids  or  suspected  bodily \nfluids  without  regard  to  whether  use  of force  was  indicated.  Where  corresponding \nserious  incident  reports  were  provided,  daily  operational  report  entries  were \nsupplemented  and  staff assaults were  coded  accordingly. \nSexual Assault  --includes  incidents  reported  as  “sexual  assaults”  in  daily  operational \nreports  or  corresponding  serious  incident  reports.  This  category  does  not  include \ngestures  or  comments  of a  sexual  nature  or  consensual  sexual  conduct,  © \nSuicide  Attempt--  includes  all  incidents  reported  as  “attempts”  in  daily  operational \nreports  or  corresponding  serious  incident  reports,  without  regard  to  whether  use  of \nforce  was  indicated.  This  item  excludes  incidents  reported  as  suicidal  “gestures”  and \n“threats.” \nSecure  Area  Extraction--includes  all  extractions  from  unit “rooms,”  outdoor  “SPAs” \nor  other  secure  areas.  ‘There  were  several  incidents  in  which  force  was  used  on youth \nin their  rooms  when  youth  held  their tray  slots  open  or  “damaged  state  property”  in\ntheir  rooms.  These  uses  of force  were  followed  by  the  removal  of youth  from  their \nrooms  for  decontamination  showers.  However,  unless  “extraction”  or  extraction \nprocedures  were  noted,  these  incidents  were  coded  as  “NFI  or  other  disruptive \nbehavior  Secure  area  extractions  are  more  appropriately  categorized  as  uses  of force \nrather  than  types  of incidents.  However,  in  order  to  identify  and  display  which  types \nof extractions  were  used  (chemical  and/or physical),  extractions  are  coded  under  the \n“type  of incident”  item. \nThe  “Use  of Force”  item  includes  the  following  categories: . \ne  Chemical--includes  all  incidents  of chemical  uses  of force,  where  chemical  agents \nwere  the  only  force  used.  Incidents  recorded  include  those  that  indicate  “chemicals” \nused,  those  that  describe  a type  of chemical  agent  used,  or  those  that  note \n“decontamination  shower  given  for  exposure.”  Also  included  in  this  item  are  all uses \nof the  “pepper  ball  launcher”  unless  the  pepper  ball  launcher  is  described  as  shooting  . \n“water”  or  “foam  baton”  rounds.  Types  of chemical  agents  were  not  otherwise \ndistinguished  between  due  to  variation  in  reporting  practices  and  the  availability  of \nalternate  use  of force  data  sources. \n¢  Physical  --includes  all  incidents  of physical  uses  of force  where  physical  force  was  the \nonly  force  used.  Incidents  recorded  include  those  that  state  “physical”  force  was  used, \nthose  that  describe  particular  physical  restraint  holds  or  those  for  which  it  is  clear  that \nyouth  resisted  and  physical  restraint  was  used  (where,  for  example,  youth  are   \ndescribed  as  being  “taken  down,” 3  64 “placed,”  or  “proned-out”  on  the  floor),  Where  it \nappears  likely  or probable  that  physical  force  was  used  but  none  of the  above \ndescribed  factors  were  present  (youth  are  described  as  “resisting”  “fighting”  or  being \n“defiant”  and  are  “brought”  to,  “escorted”  or  “placed”  in  another  location)  physical \nforce  was  not  recorded.  This  item  also  includes  uses  of the  pepper  ball  launcher  in \nshooting  “water”  or  ‘foam  baton”  rounds.  Two  incidents  involving  the  use  of a  baton \nwere  also  coded  as  physical  uses  of force. \ne  Mechanical--  includes  all  incidents  of mechanical  restraint  where  only  mechanical \nrestraints  were  used  including  hand  cuffs,  flex  cuffs  and  leg  irons.  Also  included  in \nthis  category  were  uses  of the  protective  “shield,”  spit  mask,  and  the  emergency \n  \nrestraint  chair.  Incidents  recorded  include  those  that  state  “mechanical  restraints” \nwere  applied  or  a specific  mechanical  restraint  is  mentioned  or  “youth  resisted”  while \ncuffing  or where  it  is  clear that  youth  resisted  application  of mechanical  restraints. \nWhere  it  appears  likely  or  probable  that  mechanical  restraints  were  used  but  none  of \nthe  above  described  factors  were  present,  mechanical  restraints  were  not  recorded. \n@  Chemical and Physical—both  chemical  and physical  as  defined  above. \n@  Chemical  and Mechanical—both  chemical  and  mechanical  as  described  above. \ne  Mechanical  and Physical—both  mechanical  and  physical  as  described  above. \n®  Chemical,  Physical  and Mechanical--  includes  all  reported  incidents  of chemical, \nphysical  and  mechanical  restraint  as  described  above, \nFINDINGS \nViolence \nDaily  operational  reports  show  a  total  of 4,671  incidents  of violence  in  DJJ  facilities \nfor  twelve  months  from  January  to  June  2005  and  January  to  June  2006.  The  majority  of \nthese  incidents  (3,777),  were  one-on-one  fights  between  youth,  followed  by  341  attacks  of \ntwo-or-more  youth  on  one  youth  victim,  185  fights  involving  three  or  more  youth,  142  group \ndisturbances,  100  batteries  on  staff,  81  staff gassings,  5  sexual  assaults  and  40  suicide \nattempts.

It  is  important  to  note  that  daily  operational  reports  are  not  the  best  data \n18\nsource  for  counting  total  uses  of force  or  for  distinguishing  between  types  of force  used.  DJJ \nstaff are  required  to  report  every  use  of force  in  the  form  of use  of force  reports.  These \nreports  are  the  best  data  source  for  identifying  totals  and  types  of force  used.  However,  uses \nof force  as  recorded  in  daily  operational  reports  provide  a  snapshot  of the  types  of incidents \nduring  which  force  is  used. \n  \nDaily  operational  reports  reflect  a total  of 2,914  uses  of force  in  DJJ  facilities  for  a \ntwelve  month  period  from  January  to  June  2005  and  January  to  June  2006.  The  large \nmajority  of reported  uses  of force  (2,506)  involved  chemical  agents,  followed  by  physical \nforce  reported  in  218  incidents.  Both  chemical  and  physical  force  were  used  in  107  incidents. \nDaily  operational  reports  show  that  mechanical  force  was  used  in  23  incidents  and both \nchemical  and  mechanical  force  were  reported  in  17  incidents.

DJJ compiles summary data for \nuses offorce and serious incidents as they are reported by facilities.  However, these reports \ndo not purport to reflect all incidents of violence.  Currently, there is no consistent tracking \nand summarizing system in place for incidents of violence not recorded in serious incident or \nuse of force reports.  Documentation of youth disciplinary actions (DDMS) related to violence \nin DJJ facilities is tracked and summarized regularly.  However, DDMS summaries count \nindividuals involved rather than number of actual incidents.  For example, three youth \nengaged in a mutual fight is summarized as three separate incidents (one disciplinary action \nfor each youth involved) rather than one fight involving three youth.  Relying solely on \nDDMS summary data for incidents of institutional violence would result in inflated counts. \nEvery D.T.T facility maintains daily records of incidents of violence and other \nnoteworthy events in supervisor log books and/or Daily Operational Security Reports (\"daily \noperational reports\").  Generally, facility staff record incidents as they occur on units and \nfacility grounds.  These incidents are summarized on site in the form of daily operational \nreports and/or kept in log books that facilities archive.  Log books and daily operational \nreports also contain information about uses offorce (including secure area extractions), \ninjuries to staff and youth, suicidal or disruptive behavior as well as daily facility population \nand movement.  Current DJJ policy does not require specific daily operational or log book \nreporting and, as a result, there is variation in reporting practices between facilities. \n\nHeadquarters indicates that facility staff attempt to record all incidents of institutional \nviolence in daily operational reports or log books, which makes them the most comprehensive \nsource for these data currently available.  For this analysis, data collection was limited to \ninformation that ,is reported consistently across facilities.  However, variation in reporting \npractices necessarily affects the accuracy of this count and should be considered in drawing \nconclusions. \nThe monitor received copies of typewritten daily operational reports for eight DJJ \nfacilities for the first six months of2005 and 2006.  Because Stark does not input daily \noperational information to a computer, institutional violence data for 2005 was coded and \ninput from supervisor log books at the facility in Chino.  For the 2006 data, DJJ provided \ncopies of relevant pages from the supervisor log book.  O.H. Close provided a complete set of \ndaily operational reports for the periods requested.  For the remaining facilities, there were \nsome missing days and/or shifts as noted in Attachment A. \nTo examine the frequency of serious incident reporting for various types of incidents \nof violence occurring in DJJ facilities for the two time periods analyzed, the monitor reviewed \ncopies of all serious incident reports as well as DJJ serious incident report summaries for the \ntwo periods.  DJJ provided a total of 527 reports.  However, DJJ serious incident report \nsummaries for the same period show a total of 573 serious incidents, a difference of 46 \nreports.  For the 2005 period, DJJ provided 51 fewer serious incident reports than summaries \nreflect.  However, for the 2006 period, DJJ provided 5 more serious incidents reports than \nsummaries indicate. I  The initial objective of identifying all serious incidents reported could \nnot be accomplished for this report given the discrepancies described.  However, trends in \nSee Attachment B for serious incident reports provided and DJJ Serious Incident Report Summaries. \nI \n2 \n\nserious incident reporting at each facility may be gleaned from serious incident repOlis \nprovided. \nMETHODS \nThe data source for the analysis includes: (1) daily operational reports for seven DJJ \nfacilities including, N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility (\"Chaderjian\"), Dewitt \nNelson Youth Correctional Facility (\"Dewitt\"), El Paso De Robles Youth Correctional \nFacility (\"Paso Robles\"), O.H. Close Youth Correctional Facility (\"O.H. Close\"), Preston \nYouth Correctional Facility (\"Preston\"), Southern Youth Correctional Reception Center and \nClinic (\"Southern Clinic\") and Ventura Youth Correctional Facility (\"Ventura\") for two six \nmonth periods from January through June 2005 and January through June 2006; (2) Stark \nfacility supervisor's log book for January through June 2005 and 2006; (3) serious incident \nrepOlis provided for the same facilities and time periods; and (4) monthly population data for \nJanuary through June 2005 and January through June 2006.  Incidents were recorded using \nSPSS data analysis software.  A total or nine (9) items were recorded inclnding, \"facility,\" \n\"year,\" \"'1110nth,\" \"date,\" \"time of incident,\" \"type of incident,\" \"use of force,\" \"serious \nincident repOli\" and \"gang related.\" \nThe \"facility\" item indicates at which facility incidents occur. \nThe \"year,\" \"month,\" \"date\" and \"time of incident\" items are recorded for purposes of \nidentifying incidents for specific periods. \nThe \"time of incident\" item is recorded as it appears in copies of daily operational \nreports provided.  Where daily operational reports provided do not indicate times of incidents, \nno time is recorded. \nThe \"gang related\" item includes incidents identified as gang related in serions \nincident reports.  Daily operational report entries for most facilities often indicate that gang \n3 \n\nactivity is a likely cause of many incidents of violence.  However, because reporting practices \nvary and not all gang involvement is noted, serions incident reports are the only identifier of \ngang related activity recorded for this analysis. \nThe \"tYPE; of incident\" item includes the following categories: \n•  NFl [\"not following instructions\"] or other disruptive behavior --includes incidents \nnot involving contact between youth and staff that result in staff use of force.  Among \nitems included in this category are incidents of not following instructions, damaging or \nattempting to damage state property, rough playful behavior, attempted batteries and \ngassings, self-injurious behavior not identified as attempted suicides in daily \noperational reports or serious incident reports, and defiant or otherwise disruptive \nbehavior.  Incidents of \"NFl or other disruptive behavior\" are only significant in \nrelation to use offorce data recorded in daily operational repOlis (see discussion \nbelow). \n•  one-an-one --includes all fights between two youth without regard to whether use of \nforce was indicated.  This item only includes incidents where physical contact was \nmade and excludes rough playful behavior. \n•  2 or more-on-one-- includes reported attacks of two or more youth on one youth \nvictim without regard to whether use of force was indicated.  This item only includes \nincidents wherc physical contact was made and excludes rough playful behavior. \n•  3-or-more --includes reported mutual fights between three or more youth, where \ncontact was made, without regard to whether use of force was indicated.  This item \nexcludes rough playful behavior. \n•  Group Disturbance --includes reported mutual fights, where contact was made, \nwithout regard to whether use of force was indicated.  This item includes all incidents \n4 \n\nidentified as \"multiples\" or \"group disturbances\" in daily operational reports or \ncorresponding serious incident reports and excludes rough playful behavior. \n•  StaffB  altery-- includes all reported batteries on staff where contact was made, without \nregard to ,whether use of force was indicated, that are recorded in daily operational \nreports or corresponding serious incident reports.  This item includes incidents where \nyouth, in resisting restraint, injured staff through direct physical contact.  This item \nalso includes the few cases involving spraying of liquids other than bodily fluids that \nmade contact with staff clothing or skin.  Where corresponding serious incident \nreports were provided, daily operational reports entries were supplemented and data \nwas coded accordingly. \no  StaffGassing-- includes all batteries on staff with bodily fluids or suspected bodily \nf1uids without regard to whether use offorce was indicated.  Where corresponding \nserious incident reports were provided, daily operational report entries were \nsupplemented and staff assaults were coded accordingly. \no  Sexual Assault --includes incidents reported as \"sexual assaults\" in daily operational \nreports or corresponding serious incident reports.  This category does not include \ngestures or comments of a sexual nature or consensual sexual conduct. \n•  Suicide Attempt-- includes all incidents reported as \"attempts\" in daily operational \nreports or corresponding serious incident reports, without regard to whether use of \nforce was indicated.  This item excludes incidents reported as suicidal \"gestures\" and \n\"threats,\" \n•  Secure Area Extraction--includes all extractions from unit \"rooms,\" outdoor \"SPAs\" \nor other secure areas.  There were several incidents in which force was used on youth \nin their rooms when youth held their tray slots open or \"damaged state propeliy\" in \n5 \n\ntheir rooms.  These uses afforce were followed by the removal of youth from their \nrooms for decontamination showers.  However, unless \"extraction\" or extraction \nprocedures were noted, these incidents were coded as \"NFl or other dismptive \nbehavior.?!  Secure area extractions are more appropriately categorized as uses of force \nrather than types of incidents.  However, in order to identify and display which types \nof extractions were used (chemical and/or physical), extractions are coded under the \n\"type of incident\" item. \nThe \"Use afForce\" item includes the following categories: \n•  Chemical--includes all incidents of chemical uses of force, where chemical agents \nwere the only force used.  Incidents recorded include those that indicate \"chemicals\" \nused, those that describe a type of chemical agent used, or those that note \n\"decontamination shower given for exposure.\"  Also included in this item are all uscs \nof the \"pepper ball launcher\" unless the pepper ball launcher is described as shooting \n\"water\" or \"foam baton\" rounds.  Types of chemical agents were not otherwise \ndistinguished between due to variation in reporting practiees and the availability of \nalternate use of force data sources. \n•  Physical--includes all incidents of physical uses afforce where physical force was the \nonly force used.  Incidents recorded include those that state \"physical\" force was used, \nthose that describe particular physical restraint holds or those for which it is clear that \nyouth resisted and physical restraint was used (where, for example, youth are \ndescribed as being \"taken down,\" \"placed,\" or \"proned-out\" on the floor).  Where it \nappears likely or probable that physical force was used but none of the above \ndescribed factors were present (youth are described as \"resisting\" \"fighting\" or being \n\"defiant\" and are \"brought\" to, \"escorted\" or \"placed\" in another location) physical \n6 \n\nforce was not recorded.  This item also includes uses of the pepper ball launcher in \nshooting \"water\" or \"foam baton\" rounds.  Two incidents involving the use of a baton \nwere also coded as physical uses of force. \n•  Mechanieal-- includes all incidents of mechanical restraint where only mechanical \nrestraints were used including hand cuffs, flex cuffs and leg irons.  Also included in \nthis category werc uses of the protective \"shield,\" spit mask, and the emergency \nrestraint chair.  Incidents recorded include those that state \"mechanical restraints\" \nwere applied or a specific mechanical restraint is mentioned or \"youth resisted\" while \ncuffing or where it is clear that youth resisted application of mechanical restraints. \nWhere it appears likely or probable that mechanical restraints were used but none of \nthe above described factors were present, mechanical restraints were not recorded. \n•  Chemical and Physical-both chemical and physical as defined above. \n•  Chemical and Mechanical-both chemical and mechanical as described above. \n•  Mechanical and Physical-both mechanical and physical as described above. \n•  Chemical, Physical and Mechanical-- includes all reported incidents of chemical, \nphysical and mechanical restraint as described above. \nFINDINGS \nViolence \nDaily operational reports show a total of 4,671 incidents of violence in DJJ facilities \nfor twelve months from January to JLme 2005 and January to June 2006.

INTRODUCTION \nThe Consent Decree, entered in November 2004, concerns most conditions and practices \nin what was the California Youth Authority and is now the Division of Juvenile Justice of the \nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (\"DJ],,).  Under the Consent Decree, \nDJJ was required to develop six remedial plans in consultation with experts jointly selected by \nthe parties (\"consent decree experts\"), and with the plaintiff and the Special Master.  The plans \nwere to be filed by January 31, 2005 unless the parties required more time to resolve \ndisagreements about them.  Once the plans were in place, the Consent Decree experts and the \nI \nOffice of the Special Master would monitor DJJ's compliance with those plans. \nThe parties changed the planning timetable when they agreed that DJJ could not \nameliorate the deficiencies identified in reports prepared by the Consent Decree experts in 2003 \nand 2004 without replacing the adult prison model that had taken hold with a more appropriate \nrehabilitative juvenile corrections model.  As a result, the parties extended the time to develop \nplans for such a rehabilitative model to November 30,2005. \nIn addition to its provision for comprehensive remedial plans, the Consent Decree \nrequired DJJ to develop and implement \"interim\" plans to improve some practices and \nconditions for youth pending the development of the plans that would govern long-term reform. \nIn January 2005, when the parties extended the deadline to file the plans based on a rehabilitative \nmodel, the parties agreed that DJJ had \"implemented interim measures to address deficiencies \nidentified in the expert reports\" and that DJJ would take further specified interim actions pending \n2 \ncompletion of the remedial plans due be November 30, 2005\nI Consent Decree, ~~ 8-19. \n2 January 31, 2005 Stipulation Regarding California Youth Authority Remedial Efforts  (\"January 31 stipulation\"). \n\nThe Special Master files this report to document the extent of compliance with the \nvarious interim measures to which the parties agreed in the Consent Decree and in the January \n31,2005 Stipulation Regarding Califomia Youth Authority Remedial Efforts  (\"January 31 \nstipulation\"),  The Consent Decree has a few provisions imposing additional requirements on \nDJJ independent of the remedial plans, and this report will also cover DJ]' s compliance with \nthose provisions,  In a separate report(s), the Special Master will address the audits and reports \nConsent Decree experts regarding DJJ's compliance with the filed remedial plans concerning \neducation, sex behavior treatment, disability and medical care. \nThe Special Master and Monitor gathered the information reported here in meetings, at \nfacility sites, and from documents provided in response to our requests.  It covers the time period \nfrom November 2004 when the Special Master was appointed through January 2006, with a few \ncomments based on information provided by defendant after the draft of this report was \nsubmitted to the parties on February 11,2006. \nThis report documents that defendant has substantially complied with some of the interim \nrequirements and substantially failed to comply in other areas.  The process of reforming DJ] is \nstill in its beginning phases but it is moving forward.  Given the myriad of systemic problems \nthat DJJ faces, after having been in a downward spiral for decades, it is not surprising that there \nhas been a slow start to reform. \nII,  DEVELOPMENT OF REMEDIAL PLANS \nA.  Four Of Six Remedial Plans Approved By Court Experts And Accepted By Plaintiff \nUnder the November 2004 Consent Decree, defendant was required to prepare remedial \nplans that would chart DJ]'s reform to an agency that would \"provide all youth in the CYA with \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  2 \nMarch 2005 \n\nadequate and effective care, treatment and rehabilitative services. ,,) Defendant was required to \nconsult with the court experts, plaintiffs counsel and the Special Master.  More specifically, \ndefendant's plans were required to address the deficiencies identified in the experts' reports in \neach of six subject matter areas:  general corrections, mental health including substance abuse \ntreatment and programs and services for youth in restricted housing, medical care, education, scx \nbehavior treatment and conditions and services for youth with disabilities.  The plans were to be \nfiled by January 31, 2005 unless there was an unresolved dispute between the parties concerning \nAfter entry of the Consent Decree in November 2004 and before execution of the January \n31 stipulation, defendant prepared proposed remedial plans in all areas of the case except \naccess/conditions for disabled youth.  The proposed disability plan was delayed by the outside \nexpert's schedule, a matter beyond defendant's control.  The proposed remedial plans reflected \nconsultation with the relevant experts, plaintiff s counsel and the Special Master and \nconsiderable effort by the DJJ staff that prepared them.  Nonetheless, the experts and plaintiff \nmaintained serious objections to several of the proposed remedial plans.  Plaintiff also \nstrenuously argued that California should follow the lead of other states and replace its prison \nmodel with a rehabilitative model for juvenile corrections, which would require a radical \ntransformation ofDJJ.  Toward that end, counsel for both parties and DJJ officials investigated \nalternative models in December 2004 and January 2005. 5  As the January 31 stipulation reflects, \ndefendant then committed to abandon its current prison model and to implement a rehabilitative \n) \nConsent Decree. ~ 8. \n4 \n[d., 1[11 8-17. \n5 The group visited at least one private facility in California and state facilities in  Missouri, Texas, Florida, \nWashington, and Colorado. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  3 \nMarch 2005 \n\nmodel based on principles prioritizing maintenance of a safe therapeutic environment, positive \nreinforcement, individualized rehabilitative and treatment services and successful reintegration \nof youth into their communities as productive, law-abiding citizens. \nThe January 31 stipulation, the Medical Interim Plan and Mental Health and \nRehabilitation Interim Plan together required that defendant submit \"a programmatic description \nof the rehabilitative model chosen for the CYA\" by May 2005, and its Ward Safety and Welfare \nand Mental Health and Rehabilitation plan by November 30, 2005.  The January 31 stipulation \nrequired that DJJ submit its Medical Care Interim Plan by February 4, 2005; its Education \nRemedial Plan by March 1,2005; its Mental Health Interim Remedial Plan by April 8, 2005; its \nDisabilities Remedial Plan and the Sex Behavior Treatment Remedial Plan by May 2, 2005 and \nits Medical Remedial Plan by September 1,2005.  Subsequently, defendant timely filed the \nfollowing plans that the relevant experts and plaintiffs counsel agreed were adequate:  Medical \nCare Interim Plan, Education Remedial Plan, Mental Health Care Interim Plan, Disabilities \nRemedial Plan, and Sex Behavior Treatment Remedial Plan.  Defendant timely completed his \nMedical Care Remedial Plan in September 2005 and filed it in March 2006 upon the resolution \nof a disputed issue concerning pay parity for DJJ and adult prison system clinical staff. \nDefendant filed his proposed remedial plans for Ward Safety and Welfare and Mental Health \nCare contemporaneously with the parties' November 30, 2005 StipUlation Regarding Safety and \nWelfare Remedial Plan and Mental Health Remedial Plan (\"November 30 stipUlation\") \nproviding for revision of the proposed plans by jointly selected experts6 \n11111 \n11111 \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  4 \nMarch 2005 \n\nB.  Two Remedial Plans Under Revision By Agreed Nationally Recognized Experts \nIn May 2005, defendant timely filed a Programmatic Description of the Rehabilitative \nModel for DJJ that Consent Decree experts Barry Krisberg, Ph.D., and Eric Trupin, Ph.D., \ninformed the parties and the Special Master incorporated many appropriate concepts and \npractices but was inadequately developed.  Defendant acknowledged that the programmatic \ndescription/model was still in the early stages of development and articulation, partly because he \nhad not marshaled suffieient resources for the effort.  Defendant pointed to commitments in the \nprogrammatic description/model to concepts and programs recommended by experts Krisberg \nand Trupin and asked plaintiffs counsel and the experts to wait for more specificity and detail in \nthe remedial plans.  As reflected in the pleading they filed, plaintiff s counsel agreed to reserve \ntheir objections pending defendant's development of the Safety and Welfare and Mental Health \nand Rehabilitation Remedial plans due November 30, 2005. \nIn late July 2005, DJJ selected a new top administrator, Bernard Warner, as Chief Deputy \nSecretary, Juvenile Justice, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.  It also \nassembled a six or so member dedicated internal planning team to develop the Ward Safety and \nWelfare Remedial Plan.7  As that team started work in July, it did not have enough time to \ncomplete an adequate Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan, complete with implementation and \nresource details, by November 30, 2005.8  The team worked hard and long and under great \npressure and did a lot of very good work between the end of July and November 30, reflected in \n7 Statements ofDJJ management and administrative staff, meeting with DJJ officials and staff, counsel and Consent \nDecree experts August 3-4, 2005. \n8 In order to meet the deadline, defendant would have had to assemble such a dedicated team relatively soon after \nJanuary 31 when he committed to produce a reform plan by November 30.  There were, however, competing \ndemands for staff time and attention, \nSpecia! Master Report on Interim Measure  5 \nMarch 2005 \n\nthe defendant's proposed9 Ward Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan that defendant filed on \nDecemher 1,2005, and in the Governor's hudgetary proposals that were released in January \n2006.  The team reviewed suggestions made by plaintiffs counsel and Consent Decree experts \nKrisberg and Trupin and incorporated some of them, though the shortness of the deadline \nprevented full consideration of the suggestions and incorporation of more of them.  As was \ninevitable due to the magnitude of the project and the time and resource constraints under which \nthe team labored, the draft of the plan that defendant filed on December 1, 2005 was not fully \nadequate and complete, particularly in its lack of implementation and resource details.  The \nConsent Decree experts and plaintiff refused to accept it and the parties negotiated the November \n30 stipulation under which nationally recognized experts in juvenile justice were engaged to \nreview and revise the plan. \nDJJ staff assigned to the project worked diligently with Consent Decree mental health \nexpert Trupin on the Mental Health Remedial Plan.  Dr. Trupin did not approve the plan filed \nDecember 1,2005, and plaintiff did not agree that it was a sufficient remedial plan because it \nlacked staffing and other resource and implementation details.  DJJ asserted that it was unable to \nput the resource details in the plan before the Governor's proposed budget was finalized and \nmade public.  The Plan also suffered from insufficient clinical input, in large part explained by \nthe fact that DJJ's Chief Psychiatrist position was not filled until September 2005, and its Chief \nPsychologist position was still unfilled as this report was completed. \n9 The Ward Safety and Welfare and Mental Health Remedial plans defendant filed on December 1.2005 are \n\"proposed\" plans in that they have been proposed by defendant but they have not been accepted by plaintiff or \napproved by the Consent Decree subject matter expert.  The education) sex behavior treatment, disability and \nmedical care remedial plans have been accepted by plaintiff and approved by the Consent Decree subject matter \nexpert. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  6 \nMarch 2005 \n\nBoth the proposed Ward Safety and Welfare and Mental Health Care remedial plans that \ndefendant filed on December 1,2005, provided for expert consultants to develop systems, \nprograms and implementation plans.  The Consent Decree experts Krisberg and Trupin had \nrecommended the use of outside consultants as defendant made and implemented plans to \ntransform DJJ, and DJJ administrators agreed that outside expertise was necessary and desirable. \nBy the November 30 stipulation, the parties provided for the review and revision ofDJJ's plans \nby nationally recognized experts working with the Consent Decree experts, the parties and the \nSpecial Master.  The experts have provided the parties with a proposed revised Ward Safety and \nWelfare Plan and they will complete a revised Mental Health Plan by May 30, 2006.  Defendant \nis required to file final remedial plans by June 30, 2006.  The parties believe that they have \ndevised a process and retained experts that will result in the final plans being sufficient and \ncomplete remedial plans.lO \nIII.  INTERIM MEASURES TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR YOUTH PENDING \nDEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REMEDIAL PLANS \nThe Consent Decree required DJJ to take certain actions as \"interim measures\" to \nimprove conditions for youth in its custody pending reforms under comprehensive remedial \nplans.  It required defendant to develop and implement interim plans to (1) classifY youth by \ntheir risk to others, (2) reduce violence and the need for the use of force, (3) immediately provide \nfor the treatment and management of youth on suicide watch and those who require transfer for \nacute psychiatric treatment, (4) reduce length of stay in segregated confinement, and (5) revise \nintake criteria to exclude youth who could not \"materially benefit\" from DJJ's \"reformatory and \n10 November 30 stipulation, ~~ 3, 4 and 7. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  7 \nMarch 2005 \n\neducation discipline.\" 11 The January 31 stipulation clarified and supplemented the interim \nactions. \nA.  Classification Based On Security Risk \nFollowing the strong recommendation of juvenile corrections expert Krisberg, the parties \nagreed in the Consent Decree that DJJ would devise and implement a system to separate youth \nbased on their risk of harm to others: \nBy November 1, 2004, Defendant shall propose to connsel for Plaintiff interim \nmeasures to classify wards based on their security risks and treatment needs.  Defendant \nshall consult with Dr. Barry Krisberg when developing this proposal.  The parties shall \nmeet and confer about the proposal by December 15, 2004.  Any disputes that remain \nafter the negotiations shall be addressed through binding arbitration at the earliest \navailable date.  Defendant shall implement the interim classification scheme using a \nsystem of phased implementation as soon thereafter as possible, but no later than 90 days \nafter the scheme has been finalized. 12 \nDJJ had developed a proposal by November 2004 that Dr. Krisberg approved and that plaintiff \naccepted before December 15, 2004.  DJJ staff worked with Dr. Krisberg in undertaking initial \nsteps to implement its interim proposal, and reported its failure to go beyond the initial steps to \n13 \nhim in July 2005.\nBy November 2004, DJJ staff had developed an initial classification tool that they and \nDr. Krisberg agreed adequately differentiated youth by the risk they posed to others, though DJJ \nstaff were going to pursue one more idea for improving the degree of differentiation. Then, in \nearly 2005, DJJ proposed to apply the initial classification tool to its existing population and all \nincoming commitments to determine each youth's risk category.  In the same timeframe, it \nproposed to evaluate its housing stock and plan how to separate at least the highest and lowest \n11 \nConsent Decree, ~ 7. \n12 \nId.,pa. \n13 Memorandum of Barry Krisberg (\"Krisberg 2006 Memorandum\"), attached hereto as Appendix A, p. 2. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  8 \nMarch 2005 \n\nrisk youth.  Finally, DIJ would separate the youth that posed the highest risk to others, while \nhousing them where their treatment needs would be met.  Concurrently, DJJ would develop a \nproposed reclassification instrument or decision rules to reclassify youth by risk to others, based \non institutional behavior. The reclassification decision rules or instrument would be integrated \ninto the system for separating out those who posed the greatest risk to others. \n14 \nThe proposal was memorialized in the January 31 stipulation:  \"CYA   staff, while \nimplementing the open programming model, will identify the wards most at risk of committing \nviolent acts and separate them from the wards most vulnerable to attack. ,,15  DJJ then failed to \ndischarge its commitment and legal obligation to implement the proposal.  As the parties \nstipulated on November 30, 2005: \nDJJ did not implement the interim measures it proposed under the Consent Decree to \nclassify and house wards based on their security risks (in addition to their treatment \nneeds), and it did not implement those or alternative measures under the January 31, 2005 \nstipulation to identify wards most at risk of committing violent acts and separate them \nfrom wards most vulnerable to attack. \n16 \nDJJ fine-tuned the initial classification tool and applied it to all youth, and it evaluated and \ncategorized its housing stock for lower and higher risk (to others) youth. 17  But, it then failed to \nseparate the highest from the lowest risk youth. 18  It did not seek relief from the Consent Decree \nobligation. \n14 Statements ofDJJ research staff during meeting with Special Master and Consent Decree expelt Krisberg, \nNovember 22, 2004.

See also, App. A Krisberg memorandum, pp. 1-2. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  9 \nMarch 2005 \n\nIn the November 30 stipulation, the parties put the matter of classification by risk to \nothers in the hands of one of the nationally respected experts they were retaining to revise the \nWard Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan.  Specifically, they provided: \n.... Pending implementation of the risk needs assessment as described in the Ward \nSafety & Welfare Plan filed in conjunction with this stipulation, DJ.) will direct Chris \nBaird to prepare a revenue neutral interim classification plan to increase safety for youth \nby separating them from each other based on security risks, consistent with mental health \ntreatment and rehabilitation needs, as quickly as he would recommend.  Unless justified \nby compelling reasons, DJJ will implement Chris Baird's proposed revenue neutral \ninterim classification plan according to a timetable Mr. Baird recommends that takes into \naccount DJJ's legal constraints.  DJJ will measure the short-term impact on safety \naccording to means that Mr. Baird suggests as meaningful.  Mr. Baird will consult with \nDJJ, plaintiff's counsel, the Special Master and Consent Decree designated experts prior \n19 \nto finalizing the plan.\nThis provision supercedes the Consent Decree provision on interim measures for risk \nclassification. \nB.  Reduction Of Violence And Use Of Force \nThe Consent Decree required defendant to develop and implement an interim plan to \nreduce violence and the need for the use of force with a focus on policy and training to get staff \nto use persuasion and de-escalation techniques in place of force.  Specifically, it provides: \nBy November 1,2004, Defendant shall develop, and by December 15,2004, \ndefendant shall implement a plan to reduce violence and the need for the use of force \nwithin the CYA  .  This plan shall include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following \ncomponents: \n(1) New policies and procedures to eliminate the unnecessary use of room \nextractions and chemical agents; \n(2) Training of appropriate staff on the new policies and procedures.  Each session \nof the training shall include a correctional administrator with experience in reducing \nviolence at correctional facilities; \n19 November 30 stipulation, ~ 6. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  10 \nMarch 2005 \n\n(3) Training of appropriate correctional and clinical staff on the use of non-violent \noffender management techniques; \n(4) The use of de-escalation techniques to defuse plmmed uses of force by staff \ninvolving potentially violent confrontations with youth.20 \nBy November 2004, defendant had developed and partially implemented a plan to reduce \nviolence and the use of force in DJJ.  Defendant's plan was not fully memorialized in writing, \nbut as verbally presented to plaintiff, the Special Master and expert Krisberg it included: \n(I) Training supervisory and line-staff in communication and interaction skills to \nimprove their skills in managing youth behavior; \n(2) Increasing activities for youth and staff use of positive incentives to motivate youth to \nobey rules and achieve;21 \n(3) Revising the use of force policy to distinguish immediate uses of force to protect \npersons and prevent harm from planned/strategic uses of force (e.g., cell extractions) and to \nrequire a deliberate process and additional staff members before plmmed force was used: \n(4) Revising the use of force policy to add a centralized force review process; \n(5) Retaining consultants Steve Cambra22 and Carl Larson to do an \"emergency\" use of \nforce training based on the new use of force policy; \n(5) Retaining consultants Cambra and Larson to assist in the training of supervisors on \nthe new use of force policy; \n20 \nConsent Decree, 117. b. \n21  Defendant raised the possibility of negotiating changes in employee shift schedules in order to increase hours per \nday for supervised activities and to provide more supervised activities on weekends (\"extended program day\") but \nno firm commitment was made. \n22  Both parties respect Mr. Cambra as a correctional administrator with experience in reducing force and violence \nat correctional facilities (notably Pelican Bay of CDCR's adult system). \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  11 \nMarch 2005 \n\n(6) Using the newly trained supervisors to conduct mandatory training for line staff on \nthe new use of force policy; \n(7) Requiring the implementation of a contemporaneous use of force reporting process by \nall employee participants and witnesses; \n(8) Creating and maintaining a system to collect and summarize use of force data and \nproduce monthly and annual use of force statistics and reports for management use. \nThe January 31 stipulation further specified that defendant would increase activities and \npositive incentives for youth by implementing \"open programming\" for  \"general population\" \nyouth and a \"Ward Incentive Program.\"  Specifically: \nBy February 15,2005, the CYA will develop a plan and by March 1,2005, will \nbegin implementation to institute an open programming model at N. A. Chaderjian Youth \nFacility and Heman G. Stark Youth Correctional Facility to end their lockdown model \nand restore safe general population programming and to ensure that wards are out of their \nrooms/cells daily for educational, vocational, and treatment programming as well as \nmeals and recreation.  Implementation is expected to be completed by June I, 2005 ... \nBy May 2, 2005, the CYA   shall extend the open programming model to all other \ninstitutions. \nBy April I, 2005, the CYA will replace the phase system with a ward incentive \nplan to encourage positive programming through positive reinforcement.  The Plan shall \nbe fully implemented by June 1.23 \nI. Reduction Of Youth Violence And Victimization \na.  Staff Training, Open Program And Ward Incentive Programs Intended \nTo Reduce Violence \nThree of defendant's interim violence and force reduction plan provisions summarized \nabove were intended to reduce youth violence:  training staff in communication and interaction \nskills in youth management, increasing out-of-cell time and activities for youth (\"open \nn \n23 January 31 stipulation,  2.a, c and f. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  12 \nMarch 2005 \n\nprogram\") and staff use of positive incentives to motivate youth to obey rules and achieve \n(\"ward incentive program\"),  These provisions come from the plan that defendant proposed \nunder paragraph 7,b, of the Consent Decree, and their scope was greatly increased by the January \n31 stipulation in which defendant agreed, and by which defendant is required, to  \"end their \nlockdown model\" where it existed and \"restore safe general population programming,\" \nIn November 2004, defendant provided plaintiff and the Special Master with a 50-page \nset of Instructor Notes for a four-hour staff training course on \"Effective Interaction,\" as part of \n24 \nhis plan for interim measures Defendant then represented that all staff would be provided the \ntraining, and subsequently has represented that DJJ staff have in fact been provided with \n\"Effective Interaction\" training, during the January 2004 \"7K\" training cycle, 25  Administrators \nat all facilities affirmed that their staff had participated in the communications/interaction and \nother training26 \nStaff at the Stark facility developed a special 12 hour training for all staff, supplemental \nto the effective interaction training mandated by headquarters, to support the open programming \ninitiative; this supplemental training included an \"effective staff/youth interaction\" component27 \nThe special training at Stark positively impressed consultant Cambra,28 \nThe Chaderjian facility staff was engaged in an intensive training campaign in spring \n2005 as a part of implementing the open program initiative,  In April 2005, the Special Master \nand monitor Cathleen Beltz observed most of one and all of a second training in effective \n24 This training guide is attached as Appendix B, \n25 CDCR Staff Counsel, email to the Special Master, February 7, 2006, \n26 Statements to Special Master and  Monitor during site visits April 2005 - March 2006, \n27 Statements to Special Master and  Monitor during site visit November 29, 2005, \n28 Statement of Steve Cambra to Special Master, March 23, 2006, \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  13 \nMarch 2005 \n\ncommunication and leading large and small groups.  Most of the instructional material for that \ntraining was from the Effective Interaction Instructor Notes that defendant had provided in \nNovember 2004. \nMonitor Beltz reviewed facility training documentation indicating that the \"effective \ninteraction,\" \"open program,\" and \"ward incentive program\" trainings had been provided and \nthat most staff attended.  Interviews with training officers indicated that the trainings were \nmandatory, make-up sessions were scheduled, and most staff attended the trainings. \nUnfortunately, it was not possible to determine from training records which staff or what \nproportion of staff failed to attend the trainings.  Documentation of training is inconsistent \nbetween facilities and incomplete29 \nDefendant promulgated policies for open programming and the ward incentive program \nand directed facilities to comply with those policies.  Defendant provided an initial version of the \nopen program plan for the Chaderjian and Stark facilities to plaintiff, expert Krisberg and the \nSpecial Master on February 14,2005.  Plaintiff and expert Krisberg observed that the plan lacked \nimplementation detail.  Defendant provided a revised version of the plan to plaintiff and the \n30 \nSpecial Master on April 8, 2005.\nDefendant provided plaintiff and the Special Master with a copy of an April I, 2005 \nmemorandum to all Superintendents and Assistant Superintendents directing them to implement \nthe \"immediate phase\" of the ward incentive program (1 hour later bedtime for youth with no \n29 Observation of the Special Master and  Monitor based on review of training records and statements of facility \nand headquarters staff. \n30 The revised version ofthe Open Program Model Plan is attached as Appendix c. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  14 \nMarch 2005 \n\n31 \nmisconduct) by April 5 According to DJJ headquarters staff, the ward incentive program was \nimplemented in three parts, the daily late bed line, the IS-day program credit, and the individual \nincentives (points that come with levels that can be spent on privileges and access to special \ncommissary items)32  The version ofthe ward incentive policy that was current in January 2006 \nis attached as Appendix E. \nAccording to defendant's records, 140 youth were earning 15 day/month program credits \n34 \nin December 2005,33 up from 42 in September. As this report was completed, DJJ still was in \nthe process of replacing the old phase system with the new ward incentive program.  Youth \ncorrectional counselors could not keep track of youths' levels under the new system until DJJ's \ndatabase, the Ward Information Network (\"WIN\") was modified to permit it.  They were trained \n35 \non the WIN modification in late 2005 and early 2006 The ward incentive program reflects \ndefendant's intention and effort to increase the use of positive incentives to encourage youth \ncompliance and achievement, and to build a positive relationship between staff and youth.  It \nlikely will be modified or superceded by integrated and comprehensive strategies under the Ward \nSafety and Welfare Remedial Plan due to be filed June 30, 2006. \n31 The memorandum is attached as the second page of Appendix D. \n32 Statements DJJ headquarters staff in meeting with Special Master, expert Barry Krisberg, July 27, 2005. \n33 The breakdown by institution is:  Stark 21, SRCC 7, O.H. Close 17, Ventura 13, DeWitt Nelson 38, Preston 7, \nPaso Robles 24, Chaderjian 2, and Pine Grove 11.  According to defendant, the IS-day/month-program credit is \nlimited to a maximum of 180 days per annual parole board review appearance and cannot be carried over from one \nyear to the next. Email, CDCR counsel to the Special Master, January 27, 2006. \n34 Statement Preston Superintendent, September 12, 2005. \n35 Special Master's staff interviews at Preston December 29, 2005 and monitor Beltz's staff interviews at Preston \nMarch 10, Stark March 13, Ventura March 14 and Close Mareh 17,2006 (staff felt thatthey were finally able to \nfully implement the program after recent training and conversion of the WIN database so they could use it for \ntracking WIP levels). \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  15 \nMarch 2005 \n\nThe Special Master and monitor Beltz visited all facilities, most of them more than once, \nduring 2005 and early 200636  On each site visit, they met with facility administrators and \ninterviewed numerous youth and line staff from some or all areas of the facility.  On the basis of \ntheir interviews, the Special Master finds: (1) by summer 2005, staff at all institutions and youth \nat most institutions (certainly including Chaderjian and Stark) were generally aware that \nprograms affecting activities and privileges were being implemented and that institutional \noperations were changing;37 (2) by summer 2005, the open program and ward incentive \ninitiatives resulted in a late bed line, increased in out-of-cell/dorm activities and/or special \nprivileges for many youth on several institutions which they felt was an improvement in \nconditions for them;38 (3) throughout 2005, a significant number of youth outside of restricted \nprograms spent 21 or 22 hours a day in their cells (e.g., parole violators pending revocation, \nreception status youth, high school graduates and youth with GEDs who did not have jobs, some \ngeneral population housing units at Stark and Chaderjian facilities during at least parts of 2005); \n(4) at the end of2005, many youth and staff still did not understand all aspects of the ward \nincentive program, though the level of staff understanding increased substantially in December \n2005 and early 2006 as the program was implemented on WIN and staff received formal \ntraining; (5) many youth are very interested in the possibility of earning extra program credits \nbut few understand the how the IS-day credit program works and how they might qualify for it; \n(6) neither staff nor youth generally perceived that the ward incentive program was a significant \n36 The site visit schedule is attached as Appendix F. \n37  Staff were aware of them as the \"open program\" and \"ward incentive program,\" \n38 This increase in out-of-cell activity included congregate meals for 1 or 2 meals per day for a number of wards at \nChaderjian, Stark (as well as other facilities where group dining was occurring prior to \"open program.\") \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  16 \nMarch 2005 \n\nchange from the phase system it replaced, though many staff and youth cited the increased \nprivileges and social and recreational activities as beneficial for many youth at several facilities. \nb.  Data Does Not Show Systemic Reduction In Violence, But Does \nIndicate Reduction In Violence At Chaderiian After Population Was \nReduced \nThe open program and ward incentive programs, with staff training in communication \nand youth management, were devised as strategies to reduce violence in DJJ.  Consent Decree \nexpert Krisberg had found a \"stunning amount of violence\" in 2003, based on disciplinary, \nincident and use of restraint (force) reports39  Monitor Beltz reviewed substantially eqnivalent \ndocumentary information for 2004 and 2005.  Overall, violence does not appear to have \ndecreased since the expert site visits in 2003 or entry of the Consent Decree in November 2004. \nHowever, defendant's reduction of the population at Chad in 2005 seems to have resulted in a \ndecrease in violence at that institution. \nDJJ still does not have a system to measure the incidence of violence in its facilities, as \n40 \nDr. Krisberg reported was true in 2003. This as a problem that DJJ has committed to solve in \nits proposed Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan,41  but at this time it is not possible to draw many \nfirm quantitative conclusions about the incidence of violence in DJJ.  Facilities are required to \nmake Serious Incident Reports (\"SIRs\") on some types of incidents involving violence, and \nheadquarters keeps a summary of those.  The criteria for what incidents require SIRs, however, \n42 \nleave much room for subjective judgment Also, the most common incidents of violence, \n39 Krisberg, General Corrections Review of the California Youth Authority (December 23,2003), p. 23 (\"Krisberg \n2003 report\").  The reporl was among the expert reports that were the basis for the Consent Decree. \n40 Krisberg 2003 report, pp. 22-23. \n41 Defendant's proposed Ward Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan, p. 101 \n42  The criteria are attached as Appendix G. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  17 \nMarch 2005 \n\nyouth on youth assaults, are not reported by SIR.  Finally, an inconsistent special manual count \nof SIRs that the Special Master has reviewed casts some question on the accuracy of the \nregularly kept summaries.43  Monitor Beltz's analysis of the summaries indicates an increase in \nreportable serious incidents involving violence and staff use of force from fiscal year 2003-2004 \nto fiscal year 2004-2005, and a decrease in the third quarter of2005.44  The Special Master has \nnot determined whether the trends in SIR data correlate with real changes in certain kinds of \nincidents or are a product of reporting practices. \nAll youth acts of violence are disciplinary violations, which raises the possibility that \ndisciplinary rates might be a proxy for violence.  On the other hand, many factors are likely to \naffect discipline, including staff attitudes and practices, the range of misconduct at an institution, \nthe extent offreedom of movement versus lockdown/segregation.  As Dr. Krisberg noted in \n2003, there is no standard for levels of discipline for violence in juvenile facilities and no data to \nsupport cross-institutional comparisons. \n45 \nThe Monitor and Special Master reviewed substantially the same quarterly DDMS \ndisciplinary data that Dr. Krisberg reviewed for his 2003 report.46  Since the disciplinary system \nwas substantially modified in 2003, the Special Master has not attempted to compare recent data \nwith the 2002 data.  The more recent data indicates that disciplinary rates generally were slightly \nhigher in 2005 than in 2004.  There are various possible explanations for this, as well as for the \n43 The official summaries show a total of 64 incidents for the third quarter of2005; the manual count, which is \nunofficial, shows 126 incidents. \n44  The analysis is attached as Appendices H and I.  As defendant's counsel has pointed out in reacting to the draft \nof this report, use of force by staff and violence by youth are different phenomena.  Use of restraint (force) reports \nare helpful to the study of youth violence in DJJ because many uses afforce are related to incidents of violence. \nThe Office of the Special Master does not count uses of force as incidents of violence. \n45 Krisberg 2003 report, pp. 22-23. \n46 \n[d., pp. 23. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  18 \nMarch 2005 \n\n47 \ncomparative rates of discipline among facilities. As with the 2002 data, the 2004 and 2005 data \nseem to be consistent with a high level of physical violence on the part of youth (0.6 violent \ndisciplinary cases per year per ward)48 \nDaily Security Operational Reports (\"daily operational reports\") are a third source of \ninformation about incidents of violence (and use of force) at institutions.  Monitor Beltz analyzed \nthe daily operational reports for three institutions (Preston, O.H. Close and Chaderjian) for June \n49 \nof2004 and June of2005 and crosschecked the results against her analysis of Use of Restraint \nand Serious Incident reports for the same period.  Though there are no standard criteria \ngoverning entries into the daily operational reports, this crosscheck indicates that the daily \noperational reports may be reasonably comprehensive catalogs of violence at institutions  The \n50 \nOffice of the Special Master and Dr. Krisberg are going to conduct a broader study of the daily \noperational reports for a future report in an effort to document current violence levels. \nMonitor Beltz analyzed the daily operations reports for Chaderjian for the second and \nfourth quarters of2005.  That analysis shows many fewer violent incidents in the fourth quarter \n47 E.g.. for 2004 and 2005, Chaderjian has one ofthe lowest rates of discipline for violent offenses, yet Chaderjian \nis thought to be one of two most violent and dangerous DJJ facilities.  Discipline may have been affected by the \nnumber of youth in segregation or otherwise locked in cells for substantial periods of time, or by staff perceptions of \nwhat misconduct merits discipline. \n48 DJJ's DDMS summaries and a summary of them prepared by the Special Master's office are attached as \nAppendices J-N. \n49 The analysis is attached as Appendix O. It indicates fewer incidents of violence at Chaderjian and Preston, but \nmore incidents at O.H. Close for the month of June, 2005 compared to June, 2004. The analysis of two months of \ndata is reasonably comprehensive, but not sufficient to support conclusions about violence trends. \n50 Nearly every incident of violence that resulted in use of restraint or serious incident reporting had been recorded \nin Daily Operational Reports.  The Daily Operations Reports capture some incidents not reported in the SIRs or use \nof restraint reports. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  19 \nMarch 2005 \n\nof2005 compared to the second quarter of2005, which likely is related to the population \nreduction and other measures taken to reduce violence at that facility.51 \nc.  Violence Is Pervasive And Reduction Will Require A Systemic \nApproach \nThe constant and pervasive violence in DJJ remains \"stuDl1ing,\" just as Dr. Krisberg \nfound in 2003.  DJJ's administrators and all of the numerous experts who have been engaged to \nassist with reform planning since 2003 agree that the high level of violence undermines DJJ's \ncontrol of its facilities and impedes any rehabilitative programming.  These administrators and \nexperts also agree that the high level of violence is a consequence of systemic issues including \noverpopulation in housing units, inadequate staff to youth ratios, insufficient programs to occupy \nyouth, insufficient resources to meet youths' individual treatment and rehabilitation needs and \ninsufficient ma11agement capacity to monitor conditions and practices at the facility level \n52 \nOn every site visit, the Special Master and monitor Beltz asked most of the youth and \nmany of the staff with whom they spoke about their observations and fears of violence.  Many \nstaff and most youth confirmed that racial and gang violence was a dominant fact of life for most \nyouth at most of the DJJ facilities for male youth; it was less a factor in the lives of youth at \nDeWitt Nelson and Southern Reception Center.  When the youth spoke of the \"rules,\" they \ngenerally meant the peer (gang) rules, not DJJ rules.  Gang rules dictate when a youth is required \nto initiate or join in physical violence (e.g., when certain words are uttered, when members of \none's racial group are in a group fight with members of another, when one has access to an \nSI The analysis is attached as Exhibit O. \n52 Ivisberg 2003 report, pp. 42-49; Special Master's conversations with planning experts Christopher Murray, John \nPlatt and Fred Mills (November 30 stipulation Safety and Welfare Planning experts; Special Master's conversations \nwith Consent Decree experts Tropin, Schwartz and O'Rourke; Special Master's conversations with DJJ \nadministrative staff including Chief Deputy Secretary Warner. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  20 \nMarch 2005 \n\nenemy or to someone with a \"light\" or a \"green light\" on him meaning he has been targeted by \none's gang).  At the Stark facility, the Special Master asked administrators and line staff about \nstatements of a particular youth to the effect that he had been repeatedly attacked by youth of his \nracial group only because he refused to join in racial melees.  He lived in an isolated lock-up \nsetting in order, he said, to avoid the beatings.  All the staff members that were queried agreed \nthat members of a youth's own racial group would target a youth who refused to join the racial \nviolence.  The racial and gang violence seems unchanged from 2003.53 \nAt the limits of control and following the example of California's adult prison system, \nDJJ has resorted to gang segregation, lock-up and quick and frequent use of chemical agents in \nresponse to violence in its facilities.  At Chaderjian, for example, youth affiliated with certain \ngangs are scheduled for only a half-day of school, so that they are never in the education area at \nthe same time as youth with different gang affiliations.  At Stark, some \"general population\" \nyouth are locked up 22 hours a day, cell-fed and allowed out of their cells only with youth of \ntheir race because of their allegiance to gang rules and gang racial enmities. Youth at Stark \nreport de/acto segregation at the education building, because the dominant gang/racial group has \nmade it clear that all members of another racial group will be attacked if they attempt to attend \nclasses in the trade vocational section of the education area.  Youth and staff describe frequent \nfights and melees broken up by staff use of chemical agents.  Most staff and youth maintain that \nthe youth segregated in the 21 to 23 hour/day lock-up units discussed below cannot be managed \nany other way. 54 \n5] Krisberg 2003 report, pp. 28-29. \nS4 Statements administrative staff, other staff, youth during Special Master and Monitor site visits. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  21 \nMarch 2005 \n\nThe subjective experiences and feelings regarding the racial animosity and gang violence \nvaried among individuals.  Many youth described or feared being caught up in fights or \ndisturbances because then they would be denied parole and/or have \"time added\" to their periods \nof confinement.  Almost all youth described fights and melees that they had been involved in or \nwitnessed.  A few expressed fear of pain or physical injury if they were assaulted; more admitted \nthat they did not like and did not want to participate in the violence.  Many youth had entrenched \nracist views and gang loyalties al1d willingly participated in the violence on behalf of their group. \nMany youth did not like gang culture and gang rules but did not perceive that they had any \nchoice but to conform.  Some youth were in safer housing units and programs that involved \nseparation from their more violent peers and described the violence as something that was going \non in other places within DJJ but not at all or not as much where they were.  Some members of \nthis latter group were engaged in meaningful rehabilitative programming; other members, \nhowever, were isolated and under-occupied, some of those locked in cells for most of the day. \nMany staff expressed the belief that the youth felt and were safe, and that those who \nparticipated in fights and melees freely chose to do so.  A significant number of staff reported \nwhat appeared to be real and well-based fears for their own personal safety 55  Like many youth, \nmany staff had come to accept the constant fighting and racial melees as inevitable and \nimmutable.  Most staff thought that violence could be dramatically reduced by reductions in the \nnumbers of youth in housing units and more programs and supervised activities for youth. \nUnder the terms of the January 31 stipulation, DJJ committed to \"institute an open \nprogramming model\" at Chaderjian and Stark \"to end their lockdown model and restore safe \n55 Statements of institution staff to Special Master and Monitor, site visits, 2005 and 2006 and Appendix T. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  22 \nMarch 2005 \n\ngeneral  population programming and to ensure that youth are out of their rooms/cells daily for \neducational, vocational and treatment programming as well as meals and recreation\" at all \ninstitutions within a few months.  The DJJ officials who made this commitment appeared to \nbelieve that they could bring facilities into compliance simply by directing facility \nsuperintendents to direct facility staff to engage more with youth and to provide more and \ndifferent activities and services to youth, with the support of a few hours of extra training.  They \nappeared to think that the policy changes and training described in subsection 1, above, could \nresult in safe general  population programming with most youth out of their cells and dorms most \nof the day.  They greatly underestimated the impact of systemic causes of violence and \n56 \nlockdown conditions, and systemic obstacles to change. \nAt the time defendant committed to implement \"open programming\" at the Chaderjian \nfacility, the Chaderjian facility was particularly challenged.  It lacked effective management and \nsupervision, had fewer treatment staff than other institutions, and was failing in many respects at \nthe end of2004 and beginning of2005.57  Almost half of Chaderjian's authorized youth \ncorrectional counselor and youth correctional officer positions were either vacant or encumbered \n58 \nby an employee on extended leave.

For example, soon after Chief Deputy \nSecretary Bernard Warner assumed his position, he closed Chaderjian to new admissions due to \nthe particularly difficult conditions at that facility.  According to Chaderjian' s Superintendent, \nthe youth population at Chaderjian decreased from approximately 481 to approximately 322 \n60 \nsince the August 2005 closure This is consistent with WIN data on population that was \nprovided to the Special Master in May 2005 and January 2006 (586 youth assigned May 1,2005, \n325 youth assigned January 19, 2006)61  As noted above, Chaderjian's daily operational reports \nshow a significant reduction in violent incidents from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of \n200562  Youth assaults on staff were sharply reduced63 \nThe nationally recognized experts retained under the November 30, 2005 stipulation now \nare grappling with revising the reform plans that will chart the steps by which DJJ may transform \nitself to a system that is safe for youth and staff where youth are engaged in educational, \nvocational, treatment and other programming that is designed to reform their perspective and \nenhance their skills and reduce recidivism.  They are devising short-term plans to ameliorate \nconditions and practices related to violence, force and lockdown-model confinement that will \noutline implementation steps.  These will supercede the Consent Decree provisions concerning \ninterim measures to reduce  violence. \n11111 \n60 Statement of the Chaderjian Superintendent to Special Master, January 19,2005. \n61 Administrative Summaries with population information for Chadeljian are attached as Appendix S. \n62 The analysis is attached as Appendix O. \n63  The Chaderj ian Superintendent provided the Special Master with his count of staff assaults by month from \nOctober 2004 through December 2005, which is attaehed as part of Appendix T. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  24 \nMarch 2005 \n\n2.  Management And Reduction Of Use afForce \nPlaintiff and expert Krisberg accepted the DJJ November 2004 interim plan for the \nmanagement and reduction of use offorce, detailed above.  All parties understood that the plan \nwas for the short-term, pending a change institutional environment and culture as the longer-term \nremedial plans were implemented.  The interim plan was to restrict and manage the use of force \nin DJJ in much the same way that California's adult prison system restricts and manages the use \nofforce64  This approach made sense only because DJJ's facilities were in 2003 (and still are in \nMarch 2006) very similar to adult prisons.  The Consent Decree and subsequent stipulations \nrequire defendant to transform DJJ prison-like facilities into structured rehabilitative facilities \ncharacterized by a therapeutic environment, normative culture, positive reinforcement (in \naddition to negative sanctions), adequate rehabilitative and treatment services for all youth so \nthat more youth are successfully re-integrated into their communities.  That transformation -- and \nthe new culture and environment that must replace the current conflict-ridden, locked up, and \npunitive prison culture and environment - will involve reducing violence and the use of force to \ninfrequent events.  In contrast, as of the date of this report, the use offorce (mainly chemical \nagents), like violence among youth, is pervasive in DJJ,65 in good part because fights and melees \noften result in uses of force to end them. \nBy approximately September 2004, DJJ consultants Steve Cambra and Carl Larson had \ncompleted the system-wide use of force \"emergency training\" for staff.  The training focused on \nthe basic principles governing and limiting use of force in prisons that were being incorporated \n64 Training in effective communication and non~violent management techniques - a measure to reduce use of force . \n- is discussed supra, in connection with reduction of violence and \"open programming.\" \n65 Office of the Special Master and DJJ uses afforce summaries are attached as Appendices U, V and W. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  25 \nMarch 2005 \n\ninto DJJ policy, including special procedures when use offorce may be delayed and planned \nbecause there is no imminent risk justifying immediate force, such as cell extractions.  The new \npolicy provisions on secure area extractions were intended to increase the use of effective \ncommunication in these situations to resolve them without the use of force.  In November 2004, \ndefendant provided plaintiff, the Special Master and expert Krisberg with training sign-in sheets \nfrom the \"emergency training\" and DJJ staff and responded to questions about the training. \nSubsequently, consultant Cambra confirmed to the Special Master that he and consultant Larson \nconducted the training system-wide in approximately April - September 200466 \nIn early 2005, consultants Cambra and Larsen observed DJJ staff as they trained \nsupervisors in DJJ's revised use offorce policies and procedures.  Mr. Cambra reported to the \nSpecial Master that training was appropriate and well done and that by July 2005 the trainers had \nconducted the use of force training at all facilities.67  DJJ headquarters staff and administrators at \nall facilities represented that supervisors at all facilities were trained. 68 \nThough staff had been trained in a revised use of force policy by November 2004, the \nnew policy was still in the process of being finalized and promulgated.  That process moved \nforward slowly, resulting in promulgation of a Temporary Departmental Order (TDO # 05-32) \neffective June 22, 2005.69  The TDO generally incorporated the elements that the parties had \nagreed would be included in written policy and that consultant Cambra recommended.  It \nincorporated distinctions between \"immediate\" and \"controlled\" use of force, required deliberate \nprocess and the presence of specific staff before controlled force was permitted to be employed, \n66 Statements of consultant Cambra to the Special Master, January 6, 2006. \n67 Ibid \n68 Ibid, and statements ofDJJ headquarters staff to the Special Master, June 27,2005 and February 3, 2006. \n69 The 'fDO is attached as Appendix X. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  26 \nMarch 2005 \n\nrequired supervisory staff and Institutional Force Review Committee review of all uses of force, \nestablished a central departmental review and provided for the maintenance of a use of force \ndatabase.  At the same time, because the TDO also instructed facilities to retain their prior \nversion of DJJ's use of force policies for reference, it did not fully replace the previously existing \npolicy.  This may explain the confusion that Dr. Krisberg reports concerning versions ofDJJ's \nuse of force policies7o  A more complete TDO, # 05-36, replaced TDO # 05-32, as of December \n1,200571  Even this most recent policy document is incomplete in that it refers to policies and \nregulations that are in the process of being developed. \nThe revised use of force policy provided for needed centralized review of uses of force at \nfacilities, by the newly created Department Force Review Committee.  However, though the \nDepartment Force Review Committee had been scheduled to meet on 2 or 3 occasions since late \n2004, as of February 2006 it had not yet begun to function.  In its place, headquarters staff and \nconsultant Cambra reviewed a considerable proportion of uses of force, and in early 2006, they \nwere the process of completing their review of all uses of force from July 2005 forward.  They \nfound that most facilities had serious compliance issues, but that the compliance issues generally \nrelated to report writing and other policy details and not the fact or nature of the force employed. \nConsultant Cambra and DJJ headquarters staff notified the chiefs of security at the institutions of \nthe need for corrective actions.  They identified some incidents and policy issues for review by \nthe Department Force Review Committee, which was scheduled to meet monthly beginning \nMarch 2006.  DJJ is in the process of hiring a Use afForce Coordinator (AGPA level) to take \n70 Krisberg 2006 Memorandum, App. A, p. 6. \n71 The TDO is attached as Appendix Y. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  27 \nMarch 2005 \n\nover the responsibility of reviewing facility reports and referring them for review to designated \nheadquarters staff or the Department Force Review Committee.72 \nThe performance of Institutional Force Review committees or \"IFRCs\" (which existed \nbefore the 2004 force policy revisions) has varied among facilities.  The Chaderjian IFRC was \napproximately 17 months behind until defendant employed consultant Cambra to complete the \nrequired reviews.7J  It subsequently has been able to keep its review process up to date74  The \nStark facility IFRC was behind in March 2006 because they were reviewing compliance issues in \nold incidents that consultant Cambra had referred to them for corrective action75  According to \nheadquarters staff, until recently the Southern Reception Center did not have a functioning \ncommittee but the reviews by the committees at O.H. Close, Preston, DeWitt Nelson and \nVentura facilities generally have been up-to-date.  The IFRCs at those facilities with more uses \nof force (Chade~jian, Stark, Preston and Paso Robles) consistently have been unable to review all \nincidents; at those facilities, the facility superintendent is expected to review all incidents and \nscreen out the most routine.  This practice does not conform to DJJ's use of force policy in that \nthe policy requires that the IFRC review all uses of force at a facility; DJJ should address this \ndiscrepancy.  The Chaderjian, Stark, Preston and Paso Robles facilities had hired or were in the \nprocess of hiring individuals at the AGP A level to improve the LIse of force data collection and \n.  76 \nrevIew processes. \n72 Statements to Special Master by consultant Cambra (January 6 and 31, 2006) and DJJ headquarters staff (June 27, \n2005 and February 3, 2006). \n73 \nStatements of consultant Cambra, January 31,2006 and DJJ headquarters staff, February 3, 2006. \n74 Monitor Beltz ascertained that it was current for monthly meetings and incident reviews as of her site visit March \n17,2006. \n75 Statements affacility staff to monitor Beltz during site visit March 13,2006. \n76 \nStatements of consultant Cambra, January 31, 2006 and DlJ headquarters staff, February 3, 2006. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  28 \nMarch 2005 \n\nIn November 2004, DJJ represented that it would maintain a use of force \"database\" that \nwould \"be capable of producing various statistical reports to be utilized by managers to monitor \ntrends and patterns of force used.\"77  More specifically, DJJ headquarters staff represented that \nthey were in the process of reviewing and improving DJJ's system for collection and analysis of \ninformation concerning the use of force.  Nonetheless, DJJ keeps monthly and annual use of \nforce data and statistics now much as it did in 2003.  It has a relatively accurate count of \nincidents by facility and month, and some indication as to the number of planned secure area \nextractions by facility by month.  Its count of incidents is manual by facility watch commanders \nwho must correlate staff reports to incidents by date and time.  The incidents are supposed to be \ncategorized by type offorce used, whether the incident was a secure area extraction and whether \na \"mental health ward\" was involved, but the manual process is not accurate for those details. 78 \nDJJ is not collecting and organizing all information that is necessary and useful for the \npurpose of managing use of force.  For example, the quantity of chemical agents issued to an \nindividual over a period of time or used in individual incidents is not recorded.  Whether or not \nmentally ill youth are subject to use of force is not reliably tracked.  DJJ does not track its review \nprocess; managers caml0t easily monitor whether the IFRCs and the Department Force Review \nCommittee review all cases they should, and whether compliance issues arc addressed in the \ncourse or as a result of the reviews.  DJJ also does not track use of force by staff member so \nmanagers caill10t easily check for individuals who may be using uill1ecessary or excessive force. \n77 DJJ Interim Measures Binder, Use of Force Policy, p. 9; statements ofheadquartcrs staff at November 19,2004 \nmeeting of cOllnsel, staff, expert Krisberg and the Special Master. \n78 Statements of headquarters staff July 27, 2005, in meeting with expert Krisberg and the Special Master; \nstatements of headquarters staff to Special Master February 3, 2005. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  29 \nMarch 2005 \n\nDepartmental statistics for 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 (Use of Force Overview), and the \nSpecial Master's summary of them, are attached as Appendices U-W.  Defendant does not have \ncomplete data yet for July - December 2005.  The force overview data does not indicate a \nsystemic reduction in total incidents of use afforce since 2003, though the data does indicate a \nreduction in secure area extractions, an issue targeted for reform by policy and training.  As \nmight be expected, the Monitor's analysis of Daily Security Operational Reports shows that a \nsimilar pattern for use of force as for incidents of violence (because youth violence commonly \nresults in use afforce):  fewer incidents afforce in June 2005 than in June 2004 at Chaderjian, \nClose and Preston, and a seemingly significant decrease in force incidents at Chaderjian from the \nsecond quarter to the fourth quarter 200579  Consistent with the data, when interviewed in \nJanuary and March 2006, youth and staff at Chadezjian generally reported that use afforce had \ndecreased  substantially since the summer of 2005,80 \nThe Special Master and monitor Beltz asked most youth and some staff about their \nperceptions concerning use of force.  Both youth and staff generally reported that the most \ncommon force was the use of chemical agents to break up fights when youth did not stop \nfighting on command.  Some youth said that they were sprayed with chemical agents without \nbeing warned to stop fighting, or even after they had stopped and assumed a prone position81 \nSome youth reported that they were sprayed with more, or more potent, chemical agents than \n79 The analysis is attached as Appendix V, \n80 Statements to monitor Beltz during site visits January 19,2006 and March 17,2006. \n81  Policy permits use of chemical agents \"to gain compliance with a lawful order\" but not on youth \"who are under \ncontrol.\" See, Appendix N, p. 36. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  30 \nMarch 2005 \n\nthey thought necessary.  Some youth reported that handcuffs were applied roughly or too tightly. \nAll of this is consistent with what youth reported to expert Krisberg in 2003 \n82 \nAs Dr. Krisberg observed in his 2003 report (pp. 32-33), the youth (and staff) reports \nevaluating use of force reflect what they have come to deem acceptable in the context of the \ncurrent hostile and punitive prison environment that characterizes DJJ facilities.  The parties are \njoined in an effort to replace the current prison environment, with its violence, use of force and \nisolation/segregation and lockdown, with a therapeutic, normative environment characteristic of \nrehabilitative facilities.  In the meantime, just as Dr. Krisberg concluded in 2003 (p.33), it \nappears that there is not widespread or systemic use in DJJ of what in adult prisons is considered \nexcessive or unnecessary force. \nIn their November 30 stipulation, the parties put the matter of tracking and reducing use \nofforce in DJJ facilities in the hands of the nationally respected experts they retained to revise \nthe Ward Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan.  Specifically, the stipulation provides: \nDefendant will retain experts agreed to by the parties to develop a plan to measure and \nreduce the use of force in DJJ facilities pending completion of the revised Safety 3l1d \nWelfare Plan, as he/they deem(s) appropriate but in a way that is revenue neutral.  The \nplan will cover use of restraint chairs, eliminating the use of restraint chairs if the expert \n(s) determines that is feasible.  Unless justifi.ed by compelling reasons, DJJ will \nimplement the plan according to the schedule set forth in the pl3l1 and [it] will measure \nthe short term impact as the expert( s) suggest( s) as meaningful.  The expert( s) will \nconsult with DJJ, plaintiffs counsel, the Special Master and Consent Decree designated \n83 \nexperts before finalizing his/their plan.\nThis provision supercedes the Consent Decree provision on interim measures to manage and \nreduce force. \n82 Krisberg 2003 Report, p. 32. \n83 November 30 stipulation, 1112. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  31 \nMarch 2005 \n\nC.  Mental Health Policies And Procedures \nThe Consent Decree required defendant to \"develop policies and procedures to \nimmediately provide for the treatment and management of wards on suicide watch and those \nwith acute psychiatric needs\" by November 1,2004. It required that these policies and \nprocedures \"be adopted to provide interim treatment and management of these wards pending the \ndevelopment and implementation of the remedial plans in this area.\"  It required that they \"be in \nthe form of criteria that institutions must meet for these wards, including number of hours of \nclinical intervention per week and maximum number of in-room hours per day\" and that they \"be \nimplemented by December 15, 2004.,,84 \nDefendant prepared written policies and procedures that were approved by the Consent \nDecree mental health experts by December 2004.85  In April 2005, defendant filed its Mental \nHealth and Rehabilitation Interim Plan, which extended the deadline for implementation of the \npolicies and procedures to July 1,200586  As of mid-July 2005, defendant had neither \nimplemented the policies nor sought an extension of the July 1 deadline.  From mid-July through \nDecember 2005, defendant made steady if slow progress toward implementation.  Headquarters \nstaff notified facility administrators that funding was available to pay for the costs of one-on-one \nsupervision.  After necessary labor negotiations, Temporary Departmental Orders were issued in \n84 \nConsent Decree ~ 7.c. \n85 This was confirmed in a meeting of counsel, D.TJ staff, the Special Master and Consent Decree mental health \nexpert Dr. Eric Trupin (attending by telephone connection) on December 9, 2004. \n86 Mental Health and Rehabilitation Interim Plan, 1f 16. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  32 \nMarch 2005 \n\nearly November 200587  Mental health staff were trained on the policies and procedures in \n88 \nNovember and December 2005\nThe principal difference between the new policies and procedures and those they replaced \nis the provision permitting clinicians to order one-on-one supervision for youth at-risk for self \nharm to enable youth to engage in normal activities while being monitored for their protection \ninstead of being confined on suicide watch.  As of December 2005, no staff interviewed by the \nSpecial Master were aware of an instance involving application of the new \"one-an-one\" \n. .  . . \nsupervlSlon provISIOn. \nDr. Trupin advised the parties that the new policies and procedures for handling self-\ndestructive youth and youth who express suicidal ideations or intent requires skillful \ninterventions by clinical staff.  The parties have agreed that DJJ will implement the plan that Dr. \nTrupin develops for enhancing the ability of DJJ clinical staff to manage youth with self-\ndestructive behavior, unless compelling reasons justifY otherwise. 89 \nThe Special Master has requested that the mental health experts review and report on the \nimplementation of the policies and procedures for youth on suicide watch or with acute \npsychiatric needs and on the plan for enhancing staff skills with this population in the second \nquarter of 2006. \nD.  Hiring Of Medical Director \nThe medical experts' 2003 report highlighted lack of management and leadership as \n87 The TDOs are attached as Appendix Z. \n88 Statements by DJJ administrative staff at meeting of staff, counsel and the Special Master October 18,2005; \nstatements to the Special Master by clinicians and counselors at Preston, Stark and Chaderj ian facilities during \nDecember 2005 site visits.

Both parties and the Consent Decree medical experts Puisis and LaMarre \nwere very pleased when Dr. Robert E. Morris, UCLA Professor of Pediatrics, Co-director of the \nAdolescent Program and Chief of Pediatrics at the Los Angeles Orthopaedic Hospital, was \nretained as DJ] Medical Director as of March 1,2005.  Dr. Morris' commitment to DJJ is 70% -\ntime or 28 hours/week.  He led the medical transition team that developed the Medical Care \nRemedial Plan, and he played a key role in recruiting a psychiatrist to fill DJJ's Chief \nPsychiatrist position. \nDJ] has recently hired Louise Allen as its Director of Nursing.  She is an important \naddition to the medical care management team and is playing a valuable role in the development \nof nursing policies. \nE.  Restricted Programs \n1.  Special Management Program \nThe Consent Decree required defendant to \"evaluate special management programs \ndeveloped in other states and develop a plan to reduce length of stay for wards in the special \nmanagement programs\" by November 1,2004.  The plan was to be \"consistent with national \nstandards and practice\" and to \"include a review of wards who remain in segregation for long \nperiods oftime because his or her case has been referred to a district attorney for prosecution. ,,91 \nSpecial management program (\"SMP\") housing units in DJ] were and are housing units where \nyouth considered dangerous or particularly disruptive are confined in their cells most of the day. \n90 Puisis and LaMarre, Review of Health Care Services in the California Youth Authority (August 22, 2003), p. 6. \n91 Consent Decree 11 7.e. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  34 \nMarch 2005 \n\nBefore the Consent Decree was entered, SMP youth generally were confined to their cells for 23 \nhours/day, with one hour of \"recreation\" in small fenced areas devoid of equipment. 92  Youth \n93 \nstayed in SMPs for approximately 50 to approximately 70 days on average These average \nlengths of stay were a substantial improvement compared to the lengths of stay documented by \nthe Office of the Inspector General in 2000 (approximately 9 months)94  DJJ had achieved the \nreductions in lengths of stay by developing and implementing detailed special management \nprogram policies under the close oversight of headquarters administrators.95 \nIn November 2004, defendant provided the Special Master, Consent Decree expert \nKrisberg and plaintiff s counsel with a report of the DJJ survey of seven other state systems and \nan interim plan for reducing length of stay and introducing services/programs in SMP units.  The \nreport reflected defendant's view that the restricted SMP units are necessary in order to separate \nviolent youth who pose a danger to others from other youth.  Defendant found that all of the \nseven surveyed states had restricted programs in order to separate violent youth from others. \nDefendants report noted that lengths of stay in the SMPs had been reduced as documented by the \nConsent Decree expert Krisberg's 2003 Report, and that DJJ anticipated that it would achieve \nfurther reduction in lengths of stay.  The report set a goal of eight hours/day of structured \nprogram for all youth in SMP units, including four hours of education, two hours of recreation \nand two hours of treatment services.  It did not include any indication of how that goal might be \nachieved. \n92 Krisberg 2003 Report, p. 58, 65. \n93 \nId, p. 55. \n94 Ibid. \n95 \nId., p. 55-56. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  35 \nMarch 2005 \n\nIn January 2005, DJJ agreed to \"implement clear policies and procedures to ensure that \nwards on the SMPs are provided access to educational, treatment, and other services outside their \ncells on a daily hasis\" by Febmary 15,200596  Before Febmary 15,2005, DJJ provided the \nSpecial Master, Dr. Krisberg and plaintiff with its revisions ofthe \"Delivery of Mandated \nServices Procedures\" intended to enable OJ] to meet its commitment97  Though the draft did not \nset a minimum for daily out-of-cell or stmctured program time, defendant represented that the \nminimum was three hours. The \"mandated services\" intended to provide three or more hours out-\nof-cell program time included education, large muscle exercise, counseling, telephone calls, \nvisits and religious services.  All the programs and services were to be provided out of cell and in \nsmall groups unless precluded by security concerns.  Large muscle exercise was generally \nsupposed to be provided outdoors. \nDefendant centrally monitors facility performance against the three-hour daily out-of-cell \nactivity requirement for youth in SMPs and other restricted programs.  Facilities are supposed to \nlog out-of-cell programs and activity in the WIN system, and the WIN data is monitored \ncentrally.  The WIN data indicates that most youth in SMP and other restricted program \ncategories were and are not offered three hours of stmctured or out-of-cell activity on any given \nday98 During site visits, monitor Beltz determined that SMP youth tended to have more time out \nof their cells than is recorded in WIN.99  Still, youth and staff interviewed by the Special Master \nand monitor through January 2006 nearly uniformly reported that most youth in SMP and other \n96 January 31 stipulation, ~ 2.e. \n97 The policy is attached as Appendix BB. \n98 Some of the WIN data is attached as Appendix CC. \n99 Facilities generally track recreation time in WIN but often they fail to track other out-of-cell activity such as \neducation, religious services, mental health and medical care.  At most facilities, an accurate count of out-of-cell \ntime requires calculating service minutes from several different sources. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  36 \nMarch 2005 \n\nrestricted programs were not offered as much as three hours of structured or out-of-cell activity \ndaily.  This has changed recently at the Chaderjian facility.  With the reduction in its youth \npopulation and in incidents of violence, the Chaderjian faeility was providing at least 3 hours of \nout-of-cell program time in its SMP in March 2006.100 \non's difficulty in providing even 3 hours out-of-cell time to youth in SMP and other \nrestricted programs is the result of its systemic problems.  For example, in November 2005, the \nSMP youth at the Stark facility shared K and L housing unit with a group of youth associated \nwith a northern gang who had been transferred from the Chade~jian facility as part of OJ]' s \nstrategy to reduce violence at that facility.  Because of gang-related safety concerns in what has \nbeen a largely gang-segregated system, none of the youth transferred from Chaderjian were \ndeemed able to be housed in the general population at the Stark facility and they were instead \nplaced on the SMP unit on \"general population status.\"  As the Stark K and L treatment team \nsupervisor noted, the SMP must \"run tln'ee programs at once\" and out-ot~cell time that can be \nprovided must be divided among special management, temporary detention and the \"general \npopulation\" transferees. 101 \nOlJ retained a group led by consultant Cambra to monitor its attempt to eliminate \"23-\nand-l confinement.\"  His May 24, 2005 report documents increases in out-of-cell time and \nprogramming in SMPs and other restricted programs, but it also shows that some youth were still \nbeing locked in their cells approximately 23 hours/day.  In addition, the report documents the \n100 Statements of staff and youth to monitor Beltz during her March 17, 2006 site visit; review of WIN and \nmanually kept documentation during site visit. \n101  Statement to Monitor, November 29,2005. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  37 \nMarch 2005 \n\npaucity of the program provided in SMPs and other serious problems including dirty and decrepit \n· . \nPI a nt cond thons. 102 \nConsent decree expert Krisberg, the Special Master and Monitor questioned youth and \nstaff during site visits about the restricted programs, and they have inspected activity logbooks \nand activity areas.  Staff and youth generally understand that youth in SMP should have at least 3 \nhours out of their cells, the same amount of education as other youth (minimum time prescribed \nby state law), and access to other \"mandated services.\"  Classrooms have been or are being \nadded for the use of youth on restricted programs at all facilities with SMPs, teachers have been \ndetailed to teach small classes in those classrooms, and some youth have one or a few classes per \nweek in a c1assroom.lOJ  Youth who were able to compare SMPs in tbe second half of 2005 with \nSMPs in 2004 or before generally reported that SMP conditions had become more tolerable due \nto the small increases in activity and services.  Many youth reported having the opportunity to \nleave their cells for two or three hours a day, most often to go to the small outdoor cage-like \nstructures, where they generally stand around. \nDefendant has monitored lengths of stay and numbers of youth in restricted programs. \nThe data indicates that there has been no sustained change since the end of 2003 in the lengths of \nstay in restricted programs or in the proportion of the population in restricted programs104 \nIIIII \nII  II I \n102 The report __ Cambra, Larsen and Haynes, Elimination of23-and-1 Confinement (May 24, 2005) -- is attached as \nAppendix DD. \n103 The Consent Decree education experts have monitored the provision of education services to all youth, including \nyouth in SMPs.  Their report may show more detail on the amount of education provided to youth in SMPs. \n104 A sampling of the data and a summary nfit are attached as Appendices EE and FF (length of stay) and GG and \nHH (proportion in restricted programs). \nSpecial Master RepOli on Interim Measure  38 \nMarch 2005 \n\n2,  Temporary Detention \nUnder the January 31 stipulation, defendant undertook the obligation to \"eliminate the \nuse of temporary detention as punishment\" by April 1, 2005,105  The Special Master construes \nthis provision to require DJJ to enforce policies and procedures setting criteria  (I) for temporary \ndetention placement that limit its use to legitimate short-term custody purposes and  (2) for \nconditions and practices to prevent temporary detention from being more punitive than necessary \nto achieve its custodial purpose,  Defendant has made diligent efforts in this area and has \nachieved partial compliance with the requirement thus construed,  Defendant has clearly and \nrepeatedly informed facility administrators that temporary detention may never be used as a \ndisciplinary sanction; youth are no longer being assigned to temporary detention as a formal \ndisciplinary sanction at any facility, \nDefendant's diligent efforts in this area began before December 2003 and were \ndocumented by expert Krisberg,106  As discussed above, appropriate management supervision \nhad circumscribed use of restricted programs including temporary detention,107  DJJ promulgated \npolicy that limited the justifications for placement in temporary detention to \"danger to others,\" \n\"danger to self,\" \"endangered\" and \"likely to escape,,,108  During fiscal years 2001-02 and 2002-\n03, length of stay in temporary detention was limited to an average of four days, with \n105 January 31 Stipulation, ~ 2,g, \n106 Krisberg 2003 report, pp, 53-55, \n107 Ibid. \nJ08 February 17,2005 Memorandum to Superintendents, Assistant Superintendents and Program Managers from \nYvette Marc-Aurele, Deputy Director Institutions and Camps Branch and excerpts from Institutions and Camps \nManual, attached as Appendix II. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  39 \nMarch 2005 \n\nheadquarters staff regularly reviewing placements and letelltionoJQ9~The avemge-trngtlrofstay \nfell to three days for the period April I ,2004 - March 31, 2005, and to two days for the second \nquarter of 2005. 110  Headquarters staff has continued to review all temporary detention \n111 \nplacements throughout 2005.\nAlthough management supervision seems to have limited the number of youth in \ntemporary detention and reduced their lengths of stay, as of the end of2005, it had not succeeded \nin enforcing the departmental policy limiting temporary detention to youth who pose a danger to \nthemselves or others or who require protection.  Nor had it succeeded in eliminating punitive \npractices and conditions found in temporary detention housing units.  The group led by OJ.! \nconsultant Cambra that monitored restricted programs reported apparently unjustified \ncommitments to temporary detention as well as punitive conditions and practices in May 2005.112 \nThose unjustified commitments and punitive conditions persisted through the end of 2005.  For \nexample, there were many unjustified commitments to temporary detention in the fnyo cellblock-\nhousing unit at the O.II. Close facility, throughout 2005.113 The group led by consultant Cambra \ndescribed it as \"simply unacceptable,,114 and recommended its closure pending repairs.  Consent \nDecree expert Barry Krisberg agreed that the Inyo unit was so physically decrepit that its use was \npunitive.  The consultants and experts agreed that O. H. Close could use cells attached to \n109 Krisberg 2003 report, p. 54; \"Average Length of Stay on Temporary Detention by Quarter\" (attached as \nAppendix JJ) and statements ofDJJ headquarters staff in meeting July 27,2005. \n110 Appendix JJ and statements ofDJJ headquarters staff in meeting July 27, 2005~ \n111 Statements of headquarters staff in meeting July 27, 2005, and blank form letter attached as Appendix KK; \nreport of Monica Anderson of conversation with DlJ headquarters staff February 1, 2006. \n112 Cambra, Larson and Haynes, Elimination oJ23-and-I Confinement (May 24, 2005), attached as App. DD. \n1J J Ibid., and Memoranda Barry Krisberg to Donna Brorby dated September 14 and October 25,2005, attached as \nAppendices LL and MM. \n114 \nId., P 4. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  40 \nMarch 2005 \n\ndormitory housing units for TD status youth.  Dr. Krisberg found that most youth confined in \ntemporary detention at Inyo did not meet the criteria for such confinement. As late as November \n2005, plaintiffs counsel found youth on TD status at Inyo being deprived of trousers and shoes \nin their cells and uncomfortably cold in their boxer shorts and t-shirts.  Immediately upon being \ninformed of the punitive practice, Chief Deputy Secretary Warner took action to ensure that \nyouth in TD throughout DJJ would keep their regular clothing except for youth considered at risk \n\"  \"d \nlor SUlCI  .e. 115.  \n3.  Lockdown \nThe parties agreed in their January 31 stipulation that:  \"By March 1,2005, the CYA will \nmodify its lockdown protocol to minimize the use oflockdowns through direct intervention by \nstaff.,,1I6  Defendant provided plaintiff, the Special Master and expert Krisberg with a draft \nadministrative lockdown and program change protocol in mid-February, and a final version in \nearly March 2005.  The transmission memorandum covering the final version reflects that it was \npromulgated to all facilities on March 1, and that training was contemplated within 30 days.ll7 \nDJJ's counsel reported to the Special Master that the training was completed.  The policy \nincluded forms and is relatively straightforward.  Plaintiff and expert Krisberg accepted the \nprotocol as compliant with defendant's obligation under the stipulation.  It requires facility staff \nto devise and implement an \"action plan\" to bring to an end any lockdown or limited program \nregimen that it initiates.  Further, it provides for the DJJ's top management to monitor and \nsupervise facility practice. \n115 Youth considered to pose a danger to themselves can be deprived of clothing and property for their protection \nunder the DJPs high risk observation and suicide watch policies discussed above. \n116 January 31 Stipulation ~ 2.d. \n117 The transmittal memorandum and lockdown protocol are attached as Appendix NN. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  41 \nMarch 2005 \n\nDefendant tracks administrative lockdowns, and his summary of them for the last half of \n2005 is attached as Appendix 00.  As indicated above, the Chaderjian facility was in crisis for \nthe first three quarters of 2005.  One of the responses, consistent with DJJ's adult prison model \nand crowded living units and high youth to staff ratios, was prolonged lockdown for youth that \nstaff considered incorrigibly violent and gang-entrenched. \n4.  DJJ To Implement Plan Devised By Experts For Restricted Programs And \nLockdowns \nIn their November 30 stipulation, the parties agreed that consultant Cambra and one of \nthe experts retained to review and revise defendant's proposed Ward Safety and Welfare \nRemedial Plan would \"consider and revise DJJ's policies on restricted housing SMP and TD and \ndevelop an implementation plan as they deem appropriate but in a way that is revenue neutral, \npending completion of the revised Safety and Welfare Plan.\"  DJJ is required to \"implement the \nplan on the timetable prescribed by the consultants\" and to measure short term impact\" as they \nprescribe, unless \"compelling reasons\" jnstify otherwise.1!8  They parties further agreed that DJJ \nwould retain consultant Cambra and one of the Safety and Welfare planning experts to \nrecommend a strategy for the Inyo temporary detention unit and that DJJ would implement the \nrecommendations unless there were compelling reasons to the contrary. 119 \nFinally, the November 30, 2005 stipulation provides that Steve Cambra and one of the \nnationally respected Safety and Welfare planning experts would: \nmeasure and analyze DJJ's use of lockdowns and revise DJJ's lockdown policy, pending \ncompletion of the revised Safety and Welfare Plan, as they deem appropriate, but in a \nway that is revenue neutral and consistent with state law to minimize the number and \n118 November 30 stipUlation, 1111. \n119 \n[d, ~9. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  42 \nMarch 2005 \n\nduration of lockdowns in DJJ while ensuring the safe and secure operation of the \nfacilities. \n120 \nDefendant is required to implement the new policy \"immediately,\" according to a \"realistic\" \ntimetable prescribed by the experts, \"with Mr. Cambra's help\" \"unless justified by compelling \nreasons.\" \nThe provisions of the November 30, 2005 stipulation concerning restricted programs and \nlockdown supercede the provisions in those areas of the Consent Decree and the January 31 \nstipulation.  Mr. Cambra and the Safety and Welfare planning experts completed a plan to limit \nthe use of the Inyo temporary detention unit, and to clean and maintain any portions used.  They \nare monitoring DJJ's compliance with their plan.  Some of the Safety and Welfare planning \nexperts have worked with Mr. Cambra to prepare drafts of plans on restricted program and \nlockdown policy.  Those drafts will be revised after discussions with the parties. \nF. Revised Intake Criteria \nThe Consent Decree required defendant to \"develop formal criteria for accepting wards \ninto the CYA pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 736\" by November 2004.  It \nprohibits defendant from accepting \"more wards than can be materially benefited by the CY A's \nreformatory and educational discipline\" and \"wards for whom the CY A does not have adequate \nfacilities.\" \n121 \nDefendant provided a draft of a proposed new policy on intake eriteria to plaintiff, the \nSpecial Master and the Consent Decree experts in November 2004.  The draft criteria focused on \nhealth issues and disabilities for which DJJ could not provide appropriate care and that would \n120 Jd., ~ 10. \n121 \nConsent Decree, ~ 7.r. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  43 \nMarch 2005 \n\npreclude a youth from meaningful participation in treatment and rehabilitative programs that DJ] \noffers or might offer.  Medical Director Dr. Morris reported to the Special Master, plaintiff and \nexpert Trupin that he has applied the criteria to resist commitments in a few eases. \nPursuant to his proposed Ward Safety and Welfare Plan, defendant is working with \ncounty officials and other \"stakeholders\" to define appropriate intake criteria for DJJ in the \ncontext of California's entire juvenile justice system.122  The November 30 stipulation expelis \nwill address intake criteria and population control measures in their revision of defendant's \nNovember 30 proposed Ward Safety and Welfare Plan.  Therefore, the Special Master will defer \nconsideration ofthis issue until the experts have addressed it in plan revisions or \nrecommendations. \nIV.  PROJECT MANAGEMENT, QUARTERLY REPORTING, AND EXPERT \nCONSULTANT \nA.  Expert Consultant \nThe Consent Decree provides:  \"After consultation with Plaintiff s counsel, Defendant \nshall retain a consultant with expertise in operating juvenile correctional systems to provide \nadvice concerning the management and operation of the CY A,,123  The January 31 stipUlation \nreiterates:  \"Defendant is in the process of interviewing and shall hire by March 1,2005, a \nconsultant with expertise in the custodial treatment of juvenile offenders, to be approved by \nplaintiff s counsel.\" 124 \nThe parties together selected and interviewed possible consultants who had experience as \nsuccessful managers of juvenile facilities and who could help defendant develop strategies to \n122 \nDefendant's proposed Ward Safety and Welfare Plan, p. 5. \n123 \nConsent Decree, ~ 32. \n124 January 31 stipulation ~ 3. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  44 \nMarch 2005 \n\nprogress towards compliance with the Consent Decree.  Defendant informed the Special Master \nand plaintiff that he was willing to retain any of the candidates interviewed.  Plaintiff informed \ndefendant that she would not approve any of the candidates because she had not confidence that \nthey would be helpful to defendant.  Plaintiff released defendant from the  commitment to retain \nan expert consultant.  Since that time, the juvenile justice expertise within DJJ has been \nincreased with Chief Deputy Secretary Warner taking its top administrative position.  Further, \nunder the November 30 stipulation, several nationally recognized experts have been retained to \nbring their expertise to reviewing and revising DJJ's Ward Safety and Welfare and Mental \nHealth Remedial plans. \nB.  Project Management And Quarterly Reporting \nThe Consent Decree reqnired defendant to \"hire a project manager to manage the \nremedial plans resulting from this Decree.\"  The project manager is required to \"be at the CEA I \nlevel, or equivalent Exempt level, with support as necessary to successfully manage the \ndevelopment and implementation of the remedial plans.,,125  The Consent Decree further required \ndefendant to \"provide plaintiff s counsel and the Special Master with quarterly reports regarding \nprogress made, compliance wifh deadlines and actions taken in implementing this Decree.\" 126 \nDefendant has had an acting project manager at a lower civil service level than CEA I. \nDefendant's acting project manager had neither sufficient resources to track DJJ's obligations \nand its progress towards meeting them, nor the authority to compel responses to questions and \nrequests for information or to recommend or take action improve DJJ's compliance status. \nWithin the limits of her power and her role, she has done a very fine job. \n125 Consent Decree, ~ 32. \npS. \n126 [d, \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  45 \nMarch 2005 \n\nPlaintiff and the Special Master accepted the situation with the acting project manager \nuntil the fall of 2005 when it became obvious that DJJ was unable to track and organize the effort \nto meet its obligations under plans and the Consent Decree, prepare the required quarterly reports \nand adequately respond to requests for information and documentation. \nDefendant has appointed a new project manager to track DJJ's obligations under the \nConsent Decree, other orders and the remedial plans in the this case and DJJ's progress toward \nmeeting those obligations.  The new project manager has the required civil service rank. \nDefendant has represented that the project manager will have the necessary support resources. 127 \nBeginning April 2006, Defendant will begin filing quarterly compliance reports within 30 days \nof the end of each quarter. \nDefendant has previously represented that there would be a new project manager and \nsufficient support for the project management function, in November 2005.  Then the project \nmanager and compliance team did not materialize.  DJJ remained unable to plan or produce \nquarterly reports.  It remained unable to respond efficiently and completely to experts' and the \nSpecial Master's needs for information and documentation. 128 \nIt is imperative that defendant have a project manager and support team that are focused \non facts and activities in DJJ and compliance in this case from this point forward.  Beyond \nordinary project management during litigation with which the California Department of \nCorrections and Rehabilitation CCDCR\") is very familiar, DH needs to manage a systemic \ntransformation over the course ofa few years.  Defendant's proposed Ward Safety and Welfare \n127  Statement of defense counsel Monica Anderson to the Special Master, January 31, 2006, and statements of top \nDJ] administrators in a meeting with the Special Master on February 14,2006. \n128  DJJ's counsel and headquarters staff have been very responsive to the Special Master's requests for information \nin connection with this report since January 2006 and they have provided much information very quickly. \nSpecial Master Report on Interim Measure  46 \nMarch 2005 \n\nPlan describes the scope of that transformation.  Transformation does not just happen, it must be \nmade to happen and it must be managed.  CDCR must ensure that DJJ has the resources to \nmanage the project of its reform. \nCONCLUSION \nDJJ is beset by urgent systemic problems.  Those problems cannot be denied or wished \naway; they must be directly addressed.  The progress over the past year has been disappointing, \nbut not negligible.  Strong candidates have filled key leadership positions.  Remedial plans in are \nin place covering education, sex behavior treatment, disabilities issues and medical care.  A \ntalented and hardworking team has developed a promising overall reform plan.  Nationally \nrecognized juvenile corrections experts are now working with DJJ, plaintiff and others to refine \nthe reform plan and develop detailed plans for its implementation.  In the meantime, many \nskilled and caring DJJ facility staff serve youth well and make a positive difference in their lives, \ndespite all obstacles.  They are eager  for the implementation of reform because they see the \ndestructive impact of the uncontrolled violence in DJJ and the limits of the habilitative activities \nand treatment programs that DJJ offers. \n\\'-\nj'~J~ \n\\. !  ..

INTRODUCTION \nSince the Special Master's last report, DJJ has worked closely with experts, plaintiffs \ncounsel and the Special Master to complete the revised Safety and Welfare and Mental Health \nremedial plans.  This required nearly full-time, often overtime, effort hy many ofDJJ's \nheadquarters staff.  With the filings of these two final plans, DJ] has substantially discharged its \nresponsibility under the Consent Decree to file remedial plans covering all six areas of \ndeficiencies identified by the parties' jointly selected experts in2003.!  The six areas are safety \nand welfare/ education, medical care, mental health, sex behavior treatment, and access for \nwards with disabilities.  There are still inconsistencies between some of the plans that will need \nto be resolved,3 but the focus of this case now shifts from planning to the beginning of \nimplementation and change. \nThe remedial plans are now the source of most of DJJ' s substantive legal obligations in \nthis case.  Should disputes arise under or concerning the plans, the relevant Consent Decree \nprovisions will be important.  Further, there are extant interim plans prepared pursuant to the \nNovember 30, 2005 Stipulation concerning lockdowns, restricted programs in general and the \nInyo temporary detention unit at the O.H. Close facility in particular.  Finally, the Consent \nDecree provision concerning policies and procedures for the treatment and management of youth \non suicide watch or with acute psychiatric needs will be operative until superceded either by an \nI In the Safety and Welfare and Mental Health remedial plans, plaintiffreserved her right to contend that the plans \nare inadequate under the Consent Decree as to two discrete issues, intake criteria (see, Consent Decree ~'II7.f. and \nI OJ.) and health services staffing (see, Consent Decree ~ 12.a). No finding is made or implied as to the initial \nsufficiency of the plans on these two points. \n2 The issue in the case now known as \"safety and welfare\" encompasses all of what was \"general corrections\" and \nsome of what was \"mental health\" under the Consent Decree. \nJ The plans were developed over the course of almost two years.  During that time, DJ],s strategy for reform \nevolved.  The plans will have to be implemented in an integrated way, with inconsistencies identified and resolved \nas they come up. \nThird Special Master's Report \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\ninterim plan pursuant to the November 30, 2005 Stipulation or by new policies and procedures \ndeveloped pursuant to the Mental Health Remedial Plan.4 \nSection Il.B of this report concerns the interim plan for O.H. Close temporary detention \nunit (Inyo unit).  Consent Decree expert Barry Krisberg found DJJ to be in compliance with the \ninterim plan. \nSection Il.C discusses Monitor Cathleen Beltz's systematic count of reported incidents of \nviolence in DJ.J for the periods January - June 2005 and January - June 2006.  DJJ's highest \npriority is to reduce the level of violence in its facilities.  Monitor Beltz's count is the best \navailable evidence of the level of violence in DJJ facilities in 2005 and 2006. \nAs discussed in Section IIl.B, DJ.J has not yet succeeded in implementing its policies and \nprocedures for high-risk observation and suicide/crisis watch developed at the end of2004. This \nillustrates both that the problems addressed in the Consent Decree are interrelated and structural, \nand that structural reform is required to solve them. \nProgress wlder the Health Care Services Remedial Plan is discussed in Section IV.  DJJ \nhas developed its essential policies and procedures for the delivery of health care services in \ncompliance with the Health Care Services Remedial Plan, and the Consent Decree medical \nexperts have begun monitoring health care services at individual facilities.  At this time, it is \ncritical that DJJ strengthen health services management, fill key headquarters vacancies and \ndevise a detailed Health Care Services Remedial Plan implementation strategy with internal \nauditing and tracking of progress.  It is critical also that the interface between DJJ and CDCR be \nimproved to ensure that DJJ's needs are met in the areas of contracting, information technology \nand any other support services that are to be provided by CDCR under the current organizational \nstructure. \n4 See. Mental Health Remedial Plan, p. 63. \nThird Special Master's Report  2 \nSeptemberiNovember 2006 \n\nSection V provides an update on developments in sexual behavior treatment. \nThis report was provided to the parties in draft in September 2006.  The parties' \ncomments and concerns were received by October 31, 2006.  The Special Master has taken the \nparties' comments into account in this final version, and added information obtained through \nNovember 2006 where indicated. \nII.  SAFETY AND WELFARE \nA.  Completion Of Safety And Welfare Remedial Plan \nThe revised Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan was completed and filed on July 10, 2006. \nIt reflects both the soundness of the planning DJJ had completed before the parties agreed to \nengage experts to assist with a revision as well as tremendous progress in the planning since the \nexperts were retained in December 2005.  The Consent Decree experts and other expert \nconsultants will devise standards and criteria for monitoring compliance with the remedial plan, \nin consultation with the parties and the Special Master.  The Special Master and Consent Decree \nexperts will apply the standards and criteria to measure DJJ's performance relative to the \nrequirements of the plan.  The standards and criteria for the Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan \nare to be filed by October 31, 2006.5 \nB.  DJJ Remains Compliant With Interim Plan For O.H. Close's lnyo Unit \nThe Special Master has previously reported that DJJ was substantially compliant through \nMarch 2006 with the expert-crafted January 2006 interim plan to limit the use of the Inyo \ntemporary detention housing unit at the O.H. Close facility and modify practices and improve \nconditions there6  Specifically, the plan provides that Inyo will be used to house only (1) youth \n5 The standards and criteria indeed were filed on October 31,2006. \n6 The interim plan was attached as Appendix B to the Second Report of Special Master, Compliance Status Interim \nMeasures, Disability, Education, Sexual Behavior Treatment (\"Second Report ofthe Special Master\").  The \ncompliance report through March 2006 was attached to that report as Appendix C. \nThird Special Master's Report  3 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nin need of \"temporary interventions\" by staff to de-escalate potentially dangerous situations, (2) \nyouth awaiting transfer to other facilities or to court proceedings and (3) youth charged with \nserious assaults on staff or assaults on other youth that involved the use of a weapon.7  The plan \nalso requires that the youth housed on the Inyo unit be afforded the same living conditions, \nprogram, treatment, privileges, property and state issued items as are youth housed on other \nunits, and that the living quarters meet basic sanitation and habitability standards.8  Consent \nDecree expert Barry Krisberg again found substantial compliance with the plan during a site visit \n9 \nin June 2006\nC.  Measuring The Incidence Of Violence In DJJ \nThe parties and their jointly selected experts agree that violence and fear of violence \npervade DJJ facilities and that this is antithetical to rehabilitation.  The Safety and Welfare \nRemedial Plan makes reducing violence DJJ's first reform stepw \nAs previously reported, DJJ has not had a comprehensive system for documenting the \nincidence of violence in its institutions. 11  It now is in the process of implementing one pursuant \nto its Safety & Welfare Remedial Plan; the system is due to be in place in early 2007.12  For 2005 \nand 2006, it appears that the daily operationallogs/reports kept by each institution are the most \n7 [d.. at pg. 2 \nsId., at pg. 5. \n9 See,  Krisberg, Brief Report on Site Visits to DeWitt Nelson (DWN) and O.H. Close (aBC) (July 19,2006), p. \n4.  Dr. Krisberg noted that a water damaged pOltion of ceiling required repair, but that otherwise the physical \nconditions were clean and adequate.  This represents an enormous improvement oyer conditions documented in the \nFirst Report of Special Master, Compliance with Interim Measures Provisions of Consent Decree and January 31, \n2005 Stipulation (\"First Report of the Special Master\"), pp. 40-41.  Only four youth had been housed overnight at \nInyo in the two months preceding Dr. Krisberg's site visit. \n10 See, Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan (July 10,2006), p. 23. \n11 See, First Report of Special Master, Compliance with Interim Measures Provisions of Consent Decree and January \n31,2005 Stipulation (\"First Report of the Special Master\"), pp. 17-18. \n12 See, Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan, p. 31. \nThird Special Master's Report  4 \nSeptember/November 2006 \n\ncomprehensive record of the occurrence of incidents of violence. 1)  Monitor Cathleen Beltz \ndesigned a methodology for counting the incidents of violence that were reported in the daily \noperational logs/reports for the first half of each of2005 and 2006.  Her extensive memorandum \ndescribing the methodology and the results is attached as Appendix A.  The results provide a \nbaseline that may assist DJJ, the Special Master and experts in assessing the success of efforts to \nreduce violence. \nMonitor Beltz counted a total of 4,671 incidents in the twelve months reviewed.  There \nwere 2,379 reported incidents of violence in DJJ facilities in January - June 2005 and 2,292 in \nJanuary - June 2006.  The majority of these incidents (3,777) were one-on-one fights between \nyouth, followed by 341 attacks of two-or-more youth on one youth victim, 185 fights involving \nthree or more youth, 142 group disturbances, 100 batteries on staff, 81 staff gassings, 5 sexual \nassaults and 40 suicide attempts.l4 \nMonitor Beltz depicts the breakdown by types of incidents for each period by Table 2 in \nher memorandum,15 which is replicated here: \n13 See, First Report of Special Master, pp. 17-18. The new system that DJJ has developed and is implementing is \nbased on daily operational reports.  The reports will be revised and all facilities will use the same report form and \nfollow the same instructions as to the incidents and information to be reported. \n14 See, Appendix A, pp. 7-8.  The types of incidents are defined at Appendixs A, p. 2. \n15 See, Appendix A, p. 8. \nThird Special Master's Report  5 \nSeptember/November 2006 \n\nIncidents of Violence by Type of Incident:  January -June 2005 & 2006 \n~n\"nt \n~  ! \nr~=------l \nI \n200S  200R  i  Tnter \nType of  1-on-1  1889  1888  3777 \nIncident  2 (or more)-on-1  169  172  341 \n3-or-more  105  80  185 \nGroup Disturbance  79  63  142 \nStaff Battery  58  42  100 \nStaff Gassing  46  35  81 \nSexual Assault  2  3  5 \nSuicide Attempt  31  9  40 \nTotal  2379  2292  4671 \nSource:  COCR-OJJ Oailv Ooerational Secuntv ReDons \nIn order to compare the amount of violence between time periods and among facilities, \nMonitor Beltz calculated the number of incidents of violence reflected in daily operational \nreports per 100 youth.  For all ofDJJ, daily operational reports reflect 9.6 percent more violent \n16 \nincidents per capita in the first half of 2006 (82.3 per 100 youth) compared to the first half of \n2005 (75.1 per 100 youth).  Nonetheless, two facilities reported substantially fewer violent \nincidents per capita in the first half of2006 than in the first half of2005: N.A. Chaderjian with \n46 percent fewer and O.H. Close with 23 percent fewer.17  The remaining six facilities all \nreported more violent incidents per capita in the first half of 2006 compared to the first half of \n2005, from 37 percent more violent incidents at Paso Robles to 5 percent more at Southern \nR eceptl.O n Ce nter. 18 \n16 Monthly \"actual population\" totals were averaged for each facility for the two six month periods,  The average \npopulation for all of DJJ was 12 percent lower in the first half of 2006 than in the tirst half of 2005. At Stark, the \naverage popUlation was 3 percent higher in 2006.  All other facilities had decreases in population, with the greatest \ndecreases at Chaderjian (42 percent) Paso Robles (20 percent) and Ventura (15 percent). See Appendix A, \nAttachment C tor DJJ population data. \nI7 See Appendix A, p. 12, Table 4. \n18 Ibid. Comparisons may be affected by changes in reporting practices over time or differences in reporting \npractices among facilities. \nThird Special Master's Repolt  6 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nIII.  MENTAL HEALTH CARE \nA.  Completion Of Mental Health Remedial Plan \nThe revised Mental Health Remedial Plan was completed and filed on August 25, 2006. \nThe Consent Decree experts and other expert consultants will devi se standards and criteria for \nmonitoring compliance with the remedial plan, in consultation with the parties and the Special \nMaster.  The Special Master and Consent Decree experts will apply the standards and criteria to \nmeasure DJJ's performance relative to the requirements of the plan.  The standards and criteria \nfor the Mental Health Remedial Plan are to be filed by December 15, 2006. \nB.  Policies And Procedures For Youth With Acute Psychiatric Needs And Potentially \nSuicidal Youth \nThe Consent Decree required DJJ to \"develop policies and procedures to immediately \nprovide for the treatment and management of wards on suicide watch and those with acute \npsychiatric needs\" by November 1, 2004.  It required that these policies and procedures \"be \nadopted to provide interim treatment and mal1agement of these wards pending the development \nand implementation of the remedial plans in this area.\"  It required that they \"be in the form of \ncriteria that institutions must meet for these wards, including number of hours of clinical \nintervention per week and maximum number of in-room hours per day.,,]9  The Consent Decree \nrequired implementation of the policies and procedures by December 15,2004.  The parties \nextended that date to June I, 2005 by the Mental Health and Rehabilitation Interim Plan filed in \nApril 2005. \nAs the Special Master previously has reported, DJJ developed policies and procedures \napproved by the Consent Decree experts by November 2004 and provided training to staff on \n19 Consent Decree ~ 7,c, \nThird Special Master's Report  7 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nthese policies and procedures by December 200520  Tbe current versions of the policies and \nprocedures (TDO ## 06-38 Suicide Watch and 06-39 Wards Requiring Acute Psychiatric Care, \neffective April 14, 2006) are attached as Appendices Band C. \nThe observation/watch policies and procedures require non-clinical staff to plaee a youth \non high risk observation status in an observation/watch room, under surveillance and with only \nsuicide prevention bedding and clothing, whenever they perceive a risk that the youth will \nengage in physically self-injurious behavior.2 Within 24 hours of the youth's placement on high \n! \nrisk observation, and every 24 hours throughout the observation/watch period, a mental health \nclinician must see him or her and determine whether he or she should be retained on high risk \nobservation, placed on suicide watch or crisis watch andlor transferred to a licensed facility for \ninpatient care22  If the clinician retains the youth on high risk observation or places him or her \non suicide or crisis watch, then the clinician must determine what restrictions are clinically \nappropriate for the youth.  The youth is to be allowed as much time and activity outside of the \nobservation/watch room as the clinician detennines is clinically appropriate.  The possible level \nof restriction ranges from full-time confinement and surveillance in an observation/watch room \nwith only suicide proof clothing and bedding, to part-time confinement in an observation/watch \nroom with out-of-room activities and regular clothing and possessions, including up to full-time \nregular activity in other areas of the facility.23  Staff must keep the youth under direct line-of-\nsight supervision when he or she is outside of the observation/watch room.  A youth whom the \n20 First Report of Special Master, pp. 32-33. \nStaff are trained to err on the side of caution in order to prevent suicides from occurring.  This means that oon \n21 \nj \nclinical staff must place a youth on high-risk observation in response to any suicidal gesture and/or expression of \nsuicidal ideation. \n22 The Consent Decree mental health expel1s advised DJJ approximately a year ago that the 24-hour period for \nclinical evaluation needcd to be reduced to 8 hours.  DJJ has not yet implemented that change in policy and \nprocedure.  The parties are addressing this in consultation with the mental health experts. \n23 Out-of-room activities may include meetings with clinicians or counselors, meals and shower and \nprogram/activities like school or recreation. \nThird Special Master's Report  8 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nclinician places or retains on suicide or crisis watch for being either a danger to self or gravely \ndisabled must be housed in an observation/watch room in facility infirmaries (\"OHUs\" for \n\"Outpatient Housing Unit\") if possible, and otherwise in an observation/watch room within \ncertain residential mental health program (Intensive Treatment Program or Special Behavior \nTreatment Program) units.  Youth on high-risk observation may be in observation/watch rooms \nin any housing unit that has such rooms.  Facilities must inform headquarters of the condition \nand progress of any youth who remains on crisis or suicide watch (but not high risk observation) \nfor more than 72 hours.  Facilities must update headquarters staff about any youth designated for \ninpatient transfer every 24 hours until the youth is transferred.  Serious incident reports must be \ncompleted and provided to headquarters for all off-facility transfers for emergency or inpatient \nservices.  For a youth who has been on suicide watch (but not high risk observation), the \nclinician must prepare Post Suicide Watch Precautionary Plans and the assigned casework \nspecialist/parole agent must develop or update an Identified Treatment Issue (\"ITI\") that \naddresses the underlying treatment issues that resulted in the placement on suicide watch24 \nThe Special Master and/or Monitor interviewed clinical staff and youth who had been \n25 \nplaced on high-risk observation and suicide watch at all facilities We reviewed medical \nrecords for some youth who had been placed on observation/watch. \nSuicide and crisis watch are generally conducted in OHUs or appropriate residential \nmental health program units, as required by the policies and procedure.  At some but not all \nfacilities, high-risk observation also generally is conducted in residential mental health program \nunits.  Observation/watch rooms are equipped with cameras (which seemed to be functioning \n24 See, Appendices Band C. \n25 Interviews were conducted on site visits as follows:  Stark, March 13, April 14 and September 13-15. 2006; \nVentura, March 14,2006; the Stockton complex (Chaderjian, Dewitt Clinton and O.H. Close), June 15, November \n1-2 and 6-9, 2006; Preston, March 10, June 20, 2006 and October 24-26,2006; EI Paso de Robles. September 27-29, \n2006; and Southern Youth Correctional Reception Center and Clinic, October 10-11,2006. \nThird Special Master's Report  9 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nwell enough for surveillance on all facilities).  Staff generally are aware of the policy \nrequirement that they document 15-minute room-front observations and 5-minute camera checks \nand we observed staff making and documenting the required checks.  Youth on \nobservation/watch are limited to suicide resistant clothing and bedding while in the \nohservation/watch room unless a clinician eases the restrictions (which is unusual for clinicians \nto do, though some allow some youth to have a book in the observation/watch room).  Clinicians \ngenerally see youth on high-risk observation within 24 hours of their placement, and every 24 \nhours thereafter for as long as they are on watch or observation status26  Youth and staff \ngenerally thought tbat youth on observation/watch status were safe from self-harm behaviors \nwhile there. \nAlmost all youth on suicide or crisis watch status for more than a day receive a maximum \nof two to three hours out of room time for showers and unstructured day room time (often alone \nin the dayroom).  Some have an hour or less out of their rooms in shower/holding areas.  For the \nrest of the day and night, the youth generally are alone in observation/watch rooms, limited to \nsuicide resistant clothing and bedding a perhaps a book. \nSome administrative and clinical staff seemed unaware that current policy requires that \nyouth on observation/watch status spend as much time out of their rooms as clinicians determine \nis clinically appropriate (under direct line-of-sight supervision to protect against self-harm \nimpulses).  Others were aware of the requirements of policy but felt that their facility did not \nhave did not have enough staff to provide one-on-one supervision for youth for whom more \nnormal activity would have been appropriate.  A significant number of clinicians interviewed, at \n26 In reviewing approximately 15-20 health care records of youth who had been on high-risk observation or suicide \nwatch, the Monitor found clinician's notes documenting the clinical evaluations and determinations in about halfof \nthe records.  The notes were available in WIN, but should also have been printed and filed in the health care records. \nThe Special Master will request the mental health experts to assess the record-keeping practices. \nThird Special Master's Report  10 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nmost facilities, felt that they did not have the power vis-a-vis custody staff to vary \nrestrictions/activities for observation/watch youth based on clinical judgments.27 \nThus, high-risk observation and suicide and crisis watch generally are characterized by \nisolation, idleness and deprivation that is not mitigated based on clinical judgment.  In addition \nto the resource/logistical issues,28 staff perception that most youth who threaten or engage in \nself-injurions behavior do so deliberately to force staff to move them out of their assigned \nhousing unit is a major reason for the punitive conditions.  Indeed, it is not uncommon for youth \nto threaten self-injury because they want to be moved out of their living units, often because they \nlegitimately are afraid of the violence and threat of violence there.  From a staff perspective, this \n\"manipulation\" will be encouraged unless youth lose privileges/amenities on observation/watch \nstatus.  Also, because so many youth on observation/watch status are perceived to be presenting \n\"custody\" and not mental health issues, staff may come to see especially high-risk observation as \na custody rather than mental health status?9 \nThe November 2004 policies and procedures that DJJ has partially implemented were \nintended as \"interim measures\" under the Consent Decree.  The parties and the Consent Decree \nmental health experts recently have agreed that DU will improve its observation/watch policies \nand procedures.  DJJ has undertaken to provide a new draft developed in consultation with the \nexperts, by early December.  DJJ also is developing policies and procedures for addressing the \nhousing/program assignment needs of youth who inform staff that they feel unsafe. \n27 O.H. Close stood out as an exception to this rule.  The superintendent there directed one-an-one supervision for \none youth she feared was at risk for self-harm, and clinicians interviewed there generally felt that their clinical \njudgments were respected. The Special Master was told that direct line-of-sight supervision was arranged for two \nyouth at Preston but did not learn enough about those cases to report on them. \n28 The Special Master did not attempt to assess these issues.  At least one facility was challenged by a high level of \nunfilled YCO and yec positions which made it at least very difficult to provide coverage for one-on-one escort and \ndirect line-of-sight supervision there.  DJJ will need to assess and confront these issues, in the first instance. \n29 Custody staff put youth on high-risk observation status pending clinical evaluation.  When clinicians retain youth \non observation status rather than put them on suicide or crisis watch status, it may appear to staff that the youth are \nnot thought to require mental health treatment. \nThird Special Master's Report  11 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nThe slow and incomplete implementation of the observation and watch policies and \nprocedures illustrates the need to build the \"capacity for change\" as highlighted in the recently \nfiled Safety and Welfare Plan30  The deficiencies in DJJ's management resources, policies and \nl3 \nprocedures,ll training,32 management information systems and systems for holding staff \naccountahle all played a role in the failure to implement fully the policies and procedures. \nFinally, many facilities have had critical vacancies in clinical mental health positions34  These \nvacancies likely contrihuted to the slow and incomplete implementation of the high-risk \nobservation and suicide watch policy. \nIV.  MEDICAL CARE \nThe Consent Decree medical experts, in consultation with the parties and the Special \nMaster, completed draft standards and criteria for measuring compliance with the Health Care \nServices Plan in the summer of 2006.  They conducted an audit of the headquarters Office of \nHealth Services (\"OHS\") based on site visits in June and August 2006, using the applicable \nstandards and criteria.  They will \"field test\" the standards and criteria in their first round of \nmonitoring all facilities which they are scheduled to complete hy the end of January 2007.35 \nDJJ has taken significant steps to improve central oversight of the delivery of health care \nservices since the Special Master's First Report (March 2006).  Most significant, on the timetable \n30 See, Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan (July 10,2006), Section 2. \n31 Not only are the policies difficult to read and understand, but they are not clear on key points, e,g., the criteria for \na clinician's retaining a youth on high risk observation rather than discharging him or her from observation or \nputting him or her on crisis or suicide watch and whether clinicians should restore normal clothing when clinically \nappropriate. \n32 Also, the training all the policies and procedures did not address practical implementation issues, such as how to \nimplement the policy before the WIN system was appropriately modified. There was no training to develop staff \nskills in managing fearful youth and youth who pose a risk of self-harm behavior, nor guidance in strategies for \nhandling youths' non-clinical needs. \n33 Staff have been hampered by the fact that the WIN database system has not been modified to permit them to \ndocument and track observation/watch designations and activities according the terms of the policies. \n34 Filled and vacant positions are depicted in the chart attached as Appendix D. \n35 See, DJJ Quarterly Report, Medical Remedial Plan (July 31, 2006); LaMarre memorandum emailed to the Special \nMaster August 17,2006; LaMarre and Goldenson, Medical Experts' Audit of Headquarters' Operations (September \n10,2006) (\"Medical Experts' Headquarters' Audit\"). \nThird Special Master's Report  12 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nset by the Health Care Services Remedial Plan and in consultation with the Consent Decree \nmedical experts, DJJ completed the development of 30 of 32 essential health care services \npolicies and procedures (not including all necessary forms which are still under development). \nThe Office of Health Services disseminated the policies and procedures to all facilities for the \ndevelopment oflocal facility procedures.  The remaining two of the 32 essential policies and \nprocedures are under CDCR legal review.  As of September 2006, 26 of the policies and \nprocedures had formally been adopted36 \nDJJ's Medical Director has implemented quarterly statewide health care meetings for \nmedical, nursing, mental health and dental staff.  The medical experts find this to be a very \npositive development.  These quarterly meetings encourage and facilitate communication, build \nteamwork and are opportunities for building and guiding systemic practices37 \nDJJ sought and received funding for necessary new health services positions, including \nfacility health care administrators, health care records technicians and psychiatric technicians for \nall facilities with residential mental health units.  The positions were added effective July I, \nProgress in the implementation of the Health Care Services Remedial Plan is faltering, \nhowever, due to problems with the leadership al1d management at health services headquarters. \nThese problems are reflected in the absence of a detailed Health Care Services Remedial Plan \nimplementation strategy, the limited tracking of compliance progress, the absence of formal \n36 See, DJJ Quarterly Report, Medical Remedial Plan (July 3],2006); Medical Experts' Headquarters Audit, p. 5; \nemail from expert LaMarre September 22, 2006.  By November 2006, three more policies had been adopted \nformally, for a total of29.  DJl's Office of Health Services still was working with CDCR counsel on two draft \npolicies, concerning peer review and credentialing.  The policy on organizational structure and medical autonomy \nstill was being reviewed for whether it would be formally adopted.  E-mail CDeR counsel to the Special Master, \nNovember 29, 2006. \n37 See, Medical Experts' Headquarters Audit, p. 5. \n38 See, DJJ Quarterly Report, Medical Remedial Plan (July 31, 2006); LaMarre memorandum emailed to the Special \nMaster August 17,2006. \nThird Special Master's Report  13 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\norientation for new headqualiers staff, insufficient communication between the Medical \nDirector/Health Care Administrator and subordinate staff and poor morale among bealth care \nservices headquarters staff leading to attrition by transfers and resignations.39  The attrition \nfurther weakens health services leadership and management.  For example, DJJ OHS recently \nlost a highly skilled and motivated Clinical Records Administrator who now must be replaced40 \nPoor morale also has resulted in turnover and vacancies in headquarters mental health positions. \nThe headquarters Office of Health Services is plagued by what appear to be intractable \nstaffing issues.  The salary for the Pharmacy Services Manager position long has been non-\ncompetitive and insufficient to attract qualified applicants, as DJJ and CDCR concede.  The \ncoverage that DJJ has been able to secure for the position has not filled the need for leadership \nand management in the position.  DJJ long has promised to add a Standal'ds alld Compliance \nCoordinator to the Office of Health Services by converting a position but it has failed to actually \ndo SO.41  In late 2006, DJJ reported that it was converting a particular position and planning or \ntaking steps to gain applicants and fill the position once it was created.42  There is also a need for \nadditional clerical support as health services headquarters manages implementation of the Health \nCare Services Remedial Plan43 \nDJJ's efforts to cover vacant medical (and mental health) positions by contract have been \nhindered by the absorption of their dedicated contracts staff into CDCR.  DJJ has not been able \nto tailor requests for proposals to its needs that differ from CDCR's needs, and it has not been \n39 See, Medical Experts' Headquarters Audit, p. 2, 4, and 6. \n40 See. Medical Expelts' Headquarters Audit, p. 4. \n41 See, Medical Experts' Headquarters Audit, pp. 4-5; statements of Madeleine LaMarre to Donna Brorby December \n7,2006; DJJ Response to Special Master's Office draft Third Report, October 31, 2006. \n42 DJJ Response to Special Master's Office draft Third Report, October 31, 2006; statements ofDJJ counsel at \nmeeting December 5, 2006, \n43 See, Medical Experts' Headquarters Audit, p. 2. \nThird Special Master's Repolt  14 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nable to get timely service from CDCR staff responsible for contract relationships44  The \ninterface between DJJ and CDCR for other support services is not yet working to meet DJJ's \nneeds45 \nDJJ correctly points out that it is largely dependent on CDCR and the Department of \nPersonnel Administration (\"DPA\") to solve problems involving classification of positions, salary \nand contract coverage for positions that cannot be filled.  Nonetheless, failures on the part of \nCDCR, DPA and other departments of state government ultimately will not excuse DJJ li'om its \nlegal obligations. \nV.  SEXUAL BEHAVIOR TREATMENT PROGRAM \nThe Sexual Behavior Task Force, comprised of program clinical stafffrom throughout \nDJJ, has continued to work diligently towards compliance with the Sexual Behavior Treatment \nRemedial Plan.  It is committed to building a quality program46 \nFollowing the strong recommendation of the Consent Decree expert, DJJ has provided \nfor all members of the Task Force to attend the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers \nInternational Research and Treatment Conference in Chicago, Illinois in September 200647  The \nclinicians' participation in certain state and national conferences is necessary to enable DJJ to \nbuild and maintain a sexual behavior treatment program based on current developments and \nevidence in the field48 \nDJJ has recognized the need to integrate the Sexual Behavior Treatment Remedial Plan \nwith the recently filed Safety and Welfare and Mental Health Remedial Plans.  Sexual behavior \ntreatment is one of many treatment and rehabilitation programs that will be prescribed for youth \n44 See, Medical Experts' Headquarters Audit, pp. 8-9. \n45 See, Medical Experts' Headquarters Audit, p. 11. \n46 See, Schwartz, Quarterly Report (August 2006), p. 4. \n47 See, Schwartz, Quarterly Report (August 2006), p. 2. \n48 Statement of Consent Decree expert Schwartz to the Special Master July 6, 2006. \nThird Special Master's Report  15 \nSeptemberiNovember 2006 \n\nbased on their individual treatment and rehabilitation needs.  Programming needs to be consistent \nand coordinated.  Until now, the Sexual Behavior Task Force has worked independently of the \nteams developing the Safety and Welfare and Mental Health remedial plans and it has been \nuncertain where the Sexual Behavior Treatment Program would fit in the DJJ organizational \nstructure.  DJ J needs to clarifY the organizational structure and devise a plan for developing \nconsistency between the Sexual Behavior Treatment Program and other treatment and \nrehabilitative programs49 \nThe difficulty in the interface between DJ] and CDCR staff that has interfered with \nnecessary medical contracts also has stalled progress on sexual behavior treatment curriculum \ndevelopment and implementation.  The critical work ofDJJ's sexual behavior treatment \nconsultant has been stalled for at least nine months by delays in payment and contract renewal. 50 \nVI.  EDUCATION \nThe Special Master has nothing new to report in the area of education.  The Consent \nDecree education experts have established a site visit schednle that will enable them to prepare a \nreport by Spring 2007. \nVII.  ACCESS FOR YOUTH WITH DISABIL TIES \nThe Special Master has nothing new to report in the area of access for youth with \ndisabilities.  The disabilities expert was intending to be on the same schedule as the education \nexperts until delays in the process of renewing his contract prevented that.  The contract has \nsince been renewed and he anticipates filing a report after a round of site visits by Spring 2007. \n49 See, Schwartz, Quarterly Report (August 2006), pp. 1,2,3 and 4. \n50 See, SchwaI1z, Quarterly Report (August 2006), pp. 1 and 3; DJJ progress reports on the contract through \nNovember 2006. \nThird Special Master's Report  16 \nSeptemberlNovember 2006 \n\nVIII.

STIPULATION REGARDING \n16  CALIFORNIA YOUTH \nWALTER ALLEN III, Director,  AUTHORITY REMEDIAL \n17  California Youth Authority,  EFFORTS \n18  Defendant. \n19 \n20  Since the entry of the Consent Decree in this case, the CYA   has implemented \n21  interim measures to address deficiencies identified in the expert reports and has drafted \n22  proposed Remedial Plans in consultation with the experts, plaintiff's counsel, and the \n23  Special Master.  The CYA   has also undertaken a review of practices in other systems.  As \n24  a result, the CYA has committed to reforming California'S juvenile system to a \n25  rehabilitative model based on a therapeutic environment.  The parties agree that the \n26  Remedial Plans are dependent on the new system and therefore cannot be submitted in \n27 \n28  1 \n\naccordance with the schedule set forth in the Consent Decree.  Therefore, IT IS HEREBY \n2  STIPULATED by and through counsel for the parties that: \n3  1.  Defendant shall file with the court: \n4  Medical Care Interim Plan:  February 4, 2005 \n5  Education Remedial Plan:  March 1,2005 \n6  Mental Health Care Interim Plan:  April 8,2005 \n7  Disabilities Remedial Plan:  May 2, 2005 \n8  Sex Offender Treatment Remedial Plan: May 2, 2005 \n9  Ward Safety & Welfare (formerly General Corrections) Remedial Plan: \n10  November 30, 2005 \n1 1  2.  Defendant shall implement the following immediate steps: \n12  a.  By February 15, 2005, the CYAwill develop a plan and by March I, \n13  2005, will begin implementation to institute an open programming model at N A. \n14  Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility and Heman O. Stark Youth Correctional Facility \n15  to end their lockdown model and restore safe general population programming and to \n16  ensure that wards are out of their roomslcells daily for educational, vocational, and \n17  treatment progrnmming as well as meals and recreation.  Implementation is expected to be \nI \n18  complete by June 1,2005. \nI \ni \n19  b.  CY A staff, while implementing the open programming model, will \nI \n20 I identify wards most at risk of committing violent acts and separnte them from the wards \n21  most vulnerab Ie to attack. \n22  c.  By May 2, 2005, the CYA shall extend the open programming model to \n23  all other institutions. \n24  d.  By March 1,2005, the CYA will modify its lockdown protocol to \n25  minimize the use of lock downs through direct intervention by staff. \n26  e.  By February IS, 2005, the CYA shall implement clear policies and \n27 \n28  2 \n\nprocedures to ensure that wards on the Special Management Programs are provided \n2  access to educational, treatment, and other services outside their cells on a daily basis. \n3  f.  By April 1,2005, the CY A will replace the phase system with a ward \n4  incentive plan to encourage positive programming through positive reinforcement.  The \n5  plan shall be fully implemented by June I. \n6  g.  By April 1,2005, the CY A will eliminate the use of temporary detention \n7  for pu nishm ent. \n8  3.  Defendant is in the process of interviewing and shall hire by March I, 2005, a \n9  consultant with expertise in the custodial treatment of juvenile offenders, to be approved \n10  by plaintiff's counsel. \n11  4.  By May 2, 2005, Defendant shall submit a progmmmatic description of the \ni \n121  rehabilitative model chosen for the CYA  .  The plan to transform the CY A to this \nI \n13  rehabilitative model (the Ward Safety and Welfare Remedial Plan) shall be submitted by \ni \n14  November 30, 2005.  The planning for such a transition will be developed in consultation \nIS  with the consultant hired pursuant to Paragraph 3, plaintiffs counsel, the Special Master, \n16  and the experts in the case. \n17  5.  The transition plan described in Paragraph 4 shall be consistent with the \n18  following principles: \n19  a.  Programs must be designed to provide habilitation/rehabilitation and \n20  success in the community. \n21  b.  When reasonably possible and consistent with delivery of specialized \n22  programs, youth must be placed in the facility closest to their homes.  All treatment \n23  services must be designed to include families, except where neither practical nor \n24  determined to be consistent with treatment goals. \n25  c.  Youth must be assigned to facilities and programs based on age, risk and \n26  needs assessments, and other appropriate factors. \n27 \n28  3 \n\nd.  Facilities and programs should maximize youthistaff interaction, with \n2  Ii ving units and staffing ratios that permit adequate supervision and intervention. \n3  e.  Facilities and living units should provide a safe and supportive \n4  environment that promotes rehabilitative goals. \n5  f.  The CYA   shall emphasize positive reinforcement rather than punitive \n6  disciplinary measures. \n7  g.  Lockup may be used only as a temporary intervention in emergencies or \n8  as a last resort. \n9  h. All staff that supervise wards must be qualified and will be required to \nI \n10  provide rehabilitative and treatment services.  They must be provided with thc training \nI \nII  and support they need to succeed in their jobs. \n12  i. To the extent feasible, pro grams should be based on evidence andlor best \n13  practices, or shall be evaluated for effectiveness. \ni \n14  j. Transition planning for successful reintegration must be provided to \n151 \nwards prior to release to the community. \nI \n16  6.  The parties and the Special Master shall meet every 30 days to review the \n17  remed ial procc ss. \n-4 \n~~ \n18  ~ 1/  '>.:...~ \nDated:  0  __ \n19 i \nI  A ttomey for Plaintiff \n20 ! \n1 \n21  I  -i.~/)lO~~_.  ~,.. ..  )J.~~ \nDated: \n221 \nKWfiiEill-DERSON \nDeputy Attorney General \n23 Attorney for Defendant \n1 \n241 \n25\n1 \n26 \n27 \n28  4 ",

OVERVIEW, PHILOSOPHY AND PROGRAM POLICY \nThe Youth Authority Act establishes the purpose of the California Youth Authority, to \nprotect society by providing treatment and training directed toward the correction and \nrehabilitation of youth who have committed public offences (Welfare and Institutions \n(W &1)  Code  § 1700). The California Youth Authority's vision is to contribute to the \npublic safety of the citizens of California by maintaining a safe and secure therapeutic \nenvironment,  which will result  in the  optimum delivery of rehabilitative services for \nwards charged to its care; and the mission is to contribute to the protection of society \nfrom the consequences of criminal activity by providing youthful offender rehabilitation \nthrough education, training, treatment, and parole services that provide a continuum of \ncare and assist with the re-integration of youthful offenders into society. \nThe Superintendent of Education who is responsible for managing education programs \nwithin the Department leads the Education Services Branch of the Youth Authority. The \nSuperintendent of Education serves as a member of the Director's Executive Committee. \nThe Superintendent of Education is the only position in the Department of the Youth \nAuthority  other than  the  Director  established  in  statute  (W&I  Code  1120.1)  and  is \nresponsible for administration and oversight of all functions for all education programs \nincluding: \no  Approving  all  major education program changes  such  as  new courses,  new \nprograms, program deletions and realignment of staff \no  Appointing Managers, Supervisors and staff \no  Providing clear communication and cooperation with others who work with our \nstudents in order to provide quality education to all our students \nThe Education Services Branch of the California Youth Authority (CY A) operates as a \nlocal  education  agency  (LEA)  established  in  statute  as  the  correctional  education \nauthority  and  is  known  as  the  California Education Authority (CEA)  (W &1  Code  § \n1120.2). The mission of the California Education Authority is to empower each student to \nbecome  a  civil,  responsible,  employable  and  knowledgeable  lifelong  learner.  The \nfollowing Student Learning Outcomes evolved from the California Education Authority \nmission  statement.  Students  are  Good  Citizens:  They respect themselves  and  others, \ndisplay moral character and meet their obligations to family and society. Students Value \nEducation: They are motivated and know how to learn, adapt and succeed in a rapidly \nchanging world. Students are Self-reliant: They have career goals, occupational skills and \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 1 OF50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\neffective work habits. Students are Good Communicators: They think, listen, speak, read \nand write effectively. Students are Culturally Literate: They understand the significance \nof history, literature, art and religion in a diverse and independent world. Students are \nMathematically Functional: They apply mathematics to reason and calculate. Students are \nScientific and Resourceful: They evaluate systematically and use appropriate resources, \nincluding technology, to solve problems. \nThe Branch Deputy Director/Superintendent of Education is responsible for all aspects of \nthe education program for 8 high schools within Youth Authority facilities,  1 satellite \nschool  in  the  Sacramento  parole  center  and  2  satellite  programs  located  in  the \nDepartment's youth conservation camps.  The CEA consists of central program oversight, \nsupport  and  field  operations.  Four  program  managers  and  additional  staff under the \ndirection of the Superintendent of Education administer central program oversight and \nsupport. Field operations are managed by site Principals.  Each of the CEA high schools \nis Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) accredited, two at the highest \nlevel awarded. The core education program has the basic components of a comprehensive \nsecondary education system infused with value-based character education concepts (W&  1 \nCode 1120.1).  The courses are standards-driven, that is, students must achieve specific \nmeasurable  outcomes  in  order to  progress through the  curriculum.  The three  major \ncomponents  of the  core  program  are  middle  school,  high  school  including  GED \npreparation and post secondary (W&  1 Code 1120.2). The CEA course of study must meet \nthe  Content Standards for  California  Public Schools  adopted  by the  State Board of \nEducation (W&I Code 1120.2). Each of these components includes appropriate academic \npreparation, career-technical preparation and life survival skills.  Progress through the \ncore program for special needs students is supported by supplementary services including: \nspecial education, English learner services and basic skills enhancement. General fund \nresources and several state and federal  education grants support the core program and \nsupplementary  services.  All  non-high  school  graduate  students  have  a  high  school \ngraduation plan that is reviewed periodically by education and treatment staff for progress \nin completing the required courses.  A key goal  for  education services  is to  prepare \nstudents for successful transition to the community upon release. \nTo qualify for a high school diploma, CEA students must earn 200 credits in a range of \nsubject matter consistent with the California Education Code and pass the  California \nHigh School Exit Exam (Education Code Section 51225.3, CEA Manual Section 4050-\n4060). \nEducation is a right for all students who are not high school graduates or equivalency \ngraduates. The CY AlCEA is required to develop a High School Graduation Plan (HSGP) \nand enroll each non-graduate student in an appropriate education program (W&  1 Code \n1120.1). Each regular education student who scores below the minimum level on the \nacademic achievement assessments at entry or is not making appropriate progress on \ncompletion  of their  High  School  Graduation  Plan  must  be  referred  to  the  School \nConsultation Team (SCT) process.  This regular education process includes the student, \nan administrator, the referring teacher, other education staff and treatment staff.  They \nreview the problems with the student's progress and develop an intervention plan. The \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1, 2005  PAGE10F50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nstudent remains  under the  SCT  intervention plan  and  is  reviewed  each  30 days  for \nprogress and adjustments to the interventions. The student will be continued on the SCT \nintervention  plan until  he/she  no  longer needs  the  support  of an SCT plan.  If the \nintervention plan is not successful the student may be referred to supplementary services \nincluding  special  education  (Education Code Section 55303,  CEA  Special Education \nManual, Section 3010-3020). \nAfter the resources of regular education have been exhausted and the student continues to \nnot meet the criteria for sufficient progress he/she may be referred to special education. \nThe screening, identification, placement, special services and access to education are all \nparts  of the  special  education  process  guaranteed  by  state  and  federal  statute  and \nregulation to increase these students success in the core education program (Education \nCode  Part  30,  Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act,  20  U.S.C.,  Chapter  33, \nSections 1400 and 1403). \nStudents with a primary language other than English and identified as English learners are \nprovided English Learner Services through screening, identification, special services and \nsupported access to the core education program (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \nEducation Code 52160-52178). \nA key goal for education services is to prepare students for successful transition to the \ncommunity upon release.  For over 80 years, starting with the leadership of Fred C. Nelles \nat the  Whittier  State  School,  personalized counseling coordinated with academic and \nvocational education emphasizing character development has been the cornerstone of the \nYouth Authority.  Each of the Department's facilities over the past 100 years has included \nfrom its design education as an essential element. \nIn  1996,  a  Rand  Corporation  study  reported  that  of all  crime  prevention  methods, \n\"education is the most cost-effective.\"  CYA   parole statistics since 1985 have shown that \nparolees are 3-5 times more likely to succeed on parole if they have earned a high school \ndiploma or GED prior to being paroled.  Because of this compelling data, a high school \ngraduation or equivalency certification policy was implemented May 1, 1998. This policy \nstates that students who have not earned a high school diploma are required to have an \nindividualized  High  School  Graduation  Plan  leading  to  a  high  school  diploma  or \nequivalency certificate including the GED certificate. The High School Graduation Plan \nmay be complete while in CYA   or during parole. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 3 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nThere are eight California Education Authority high schools within Youth Correctional \nFacilities: \nCEA High School  CYA   Youth Correctional Facility \nJames A.

STAFFING \nHaving sufficient quality staffing is the major resource needed to  reach and maintain \ncompliance and provide a quality education to our students. Recruitment and retention of \nquality staff is in direct correlation to the salary and working conditions in the CEA high \nschools as they relates to other public schools in California. The CEA will remediate the \nproceeding five education deficiencies by having an adequate stable quality workforce. \nThe experts noted that the CEA does not employ an adequate number of credentialed \nteachers/specialists and substitutes in both general education and special education.  The \ncurrent number of teacher and specialist positions is not adequate to ensure each non \ngraduate  has  access  to  each  required  content  area,  a  minimum  school  day  and \nsupplemental  services  to  support  completion  of the  requirements  for  high  school \ngraduation.  According to the experts, there is a need for differentiated staffing due to the \nnumerous  specialty  units  and  restricted  settings  that  require  a  higher  staffing  ratio. \nCurrently, specialized treatment programs are not created with the necessary funding to \nensure student access to education in special or restricted settings. The current staffing \nformula uses a baseline developed many years ago and should be updated to meet the \nunique needs of the  ward population.  The  number of regular and  special education \nteachers allocated is not adequate to meet the current 15: 1 and 12: 1 staffing ratios. At \neach  CEA  high  school,  teachers'  assignments  should  be  in  their  credentialed \nauthorizations only. \nThe experts also stated that the CY A is unable to recruit and retain credentialed teachers \nand specialists due to the inability to provide competitive salaries and due to the changing \navailability of funding.  Due to budgetary constraints, the funding for teacher positions is \neliminated monthly if the ward population drops by 15 wards. There is an agreement with \nthe Department of Finance that based on the February 2003 California Youth Authority \nReport On Education Funding Levels (Supplemental Report of 2002 Budget Act, Item \n5460-011-0001) the funding of teacher positions and the relief teachers at 15% will be \naccomplished incrementally by not eliminating funding due to declining population until \nthe  Report's requested ratios are reached.  The CYA will develop a proposal for the \nDepartment of Finance by May 2005 to budget instructional positions for the following \nfiscal year on an annual projection adjusted for declining population once at the end of \neach fiscal year. \nThe  CY AlCEA commits to  a minimum two year implementation through the  budget \nprocess  commencing  with  the  2005-06  fiscal  year  that  will  update  the  funding \nformulas/ratios  to  the  levels  noted  in  the  following  paragraph  (including  added \nfunding/ratios  for  restricted  settings  and  substitute  teachers).  Through  this  process, \nadditional  positions  for  non-credentialed  staff will  be  added  to  deliver required,  but \npreviously unfunded, non-instructional activities. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 5 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nCEA  has  identified  the  required  level  of:  1)  credentialed  administrators  and  non \ninstructional  staff to  develop,  support,  lead  and  manage  a quality education delivery \nsystem; 2) credentialed teachers, instructors (at least one teacher in each content area \nneeded for graduation and  12:1  general  education,  10:1  special  day class and special \nprograms (ITP,  SCP,  SOP),  5:1  restricted programs and  specialists to  deliver quality \neducation services or provide instructional support (at least one teacher or specialist for \neach  supplemental  service  area  and  additional  specialists  at  1: 10 4  service  hours  per \nmonth based on actual IEP hours), relief teachers and specialists at 15% (this percentage \nwill be reviewed and may need to be adjusted until the Academic Calendar is in place, the \nrate  of closed  classrooms  due  to  instructional  staff absence  and  teacher/specialist \nvacancies are at or below 5%) and 3) non-credentialed support staff to perform services \nnecessary to enable a quality education system and for which a credential is not required. \nThe relief factor of 15% is based on the recommendation of the education experts and the \nstudy  done  for  the  February  2003  California Youth  Authority  Report  On Education \nFunding. \nEach  high  school,  regardless  of population,  shall  have  a  mImmum  complement  of \ncredentialed staff to include at least one teacher credentialed in each content area needed \nfor  graduation  (English,  math,  life  science,  physical  science,  history,  economics, \ngovernment,  art or foreign  language,  physical education, career-technical and  English \nlanguage development [11]) and additional teachers based on appropriate ratios, and a \nminimum of at least one teacher or specialist needed for each supplementary service area \n(special day class, resource specialist program, school/leaming counseling, and speech \ntherapy [4])  and additional specialists based on actual IEP service hours (one specialist \nfor each 104 hours of service per month). Each high school serving restricted programs \nshall have at least two school psychologists. All calculations except relief are rounded up \nto the nearest full position to ensure services are provided and to remove the barrier to \nrecruitment and retention presented by part time positions.

This is a continuing effort started in 2004 \nthrough the School Improvement Review process. The steps to accomplish this are as \nfollows:  ' \n);>  Principals ensure each credentialed staff have completed a credential survey by \nMarch 2005 \n);>  Principals identify any misaligned instructional staff and report to Superintendent \nof Education by March 2005 \n);>  Superintendent of Education develops a credential alignment plan for the Director \n);>  Director approves alignment plan \n);>  Labor Relations notices the employee representative \n);>  Personnel notices the affected employees if appropriate \n);>  Labor Relations negotiated the impact with the employee representative \n);>  Alignment plan implemented \nA  recruitment  plan  is  in  place,  the  Superintendent  of Education  has  selected  two \nrecruiters and contracts will be established as necessary for recruitment services to engage \nwith college and university teacher preparation programs, placement offices, professional \norganizations, and to conduct career fairs.  A continuous testing process is in place and \napplications are reviewed each month. \nThis will ensure that credentialed faculty is of sufficient quantity and credentialed in the \nspecific content areas or special service areas to provide the required core content and \nsupplemental  services  to  ensure  there  is  the  capacity  to  provide  access.  CEA must \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 24 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\ncontinue to meet the No Child Left Behind standards for teachers ensuring that each \nteacher providing core content instruction is appropriately credentialed in that content \narea.  Sufficient appropriately credentialed administrators lead, manage and support the \ndelivery of quality education to each student in the CEA district. \nThus a student in a CEA high school enrolled at least 240 minutes each scheduled school \nday  will  receive  the  same  annual  hours  of instruction  as  their counterparts  in other \nCalifornia public high schools. There will be sufficient local and district administrative \nstaff to  provide the  basic  support to  maintain a quality instructional delivery system \nincluding, but not limited to: data collection, management/supervision, and analysis to \nimprove  instruction;  professional  development;  curriculum  development;  grants \ndevelopment  and  management;  supplementary  services  management  and  continuous \nimprovement monitoring and technical assistance. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1, 2005  PAGE 25 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nEDUCATION SERVICES BRANCH \nCALIFORNIA EDUCATION AUTHORITY \nIII.  STUDENT ACCESS AND ATTENDANCE \nA.  INTRODUCTION \nStudent access to educational services is the key to providing eligible students with an \nopportunity to complete their high school education and gain valuable training in job skill \nareas as well as insights into basic living and survival skills. All eligible students will \nhave access to any educational programs and supplementary services necessary to ensure \nsuccessful completion of all high school, vocational and life-survival skill courses.  This \nconforms to the Mission of the California Youth Authority: to provide education, \ntreatment and training delineated in Section 1. Student access to educational programs is \nnecessary for compliance with federal and state laws and Education and Welfare & \nInstitution Codes, as well as CY A policies. \nB.  STUDENT ACCESS TO ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND LIFE \nSURVIVAL SKILLS \nAccess  to  educational  services  was  an  issue  embedded  throughout  the  educational \nexperts' report.  Specific items mentioned that impede access for students in the CYA \nwere  inadequate  staffing  levels,  poor  class  attendance  rates,  closed  classrooms,  and \nrestricted program settings where wards were not allowed access to a minimum 240-\nminute instructional day. \nCurrently, all  California Education Authority (CEA) schools provide a comprehensive \nhigh school educational program based on the Model Content and Performance Standards \nof the  California State  Department of Education and  subject area Frameworks.  The \ncurriculum includes core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, \nGED  preparation,  basic  skills  enhancement,  and college preparation.  All  curriculum \npresented to students is infused with values-based character education.  Supplemental \nservices include library services, special education, English learner services, basic skills \nenhancement  including  literacy,  high  school  credit  work  experience,  and  community \nservice. A goal of GED completion on a student's HSGP is dependent on the student's \nage (at least 17), academic achievement level (235 or better on the CASAS assessments), \ntransition goals and if hislher length of stay will allow time to complete courses for a high \nschool  diploma.  Additional  non-proposition  98  funding  is  required  to  meet  the \neducational needs (career/ technical preparation and college preparation) of the graduate \npopulation. \nPrior to arrival, all student files are screened for possible special education history. As \nstudents arrive  at CEA high  schools,  they are  assessed and enrolled into  appropriate \neducational programs within 4 school days of their arrival.  At intake, basic academic and \nlife  skills are  assessed.  At the  same time  students are  surveyed about their language \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 26 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nbackground,  school needs and histories.  This initial survey may serve as a basis for \nfurther  testing  to  determine  English  Language  Learning  needs  and  to  assist  with \nappropriate placement into core curricular classes. \nAt program sites, within 4 school days of the student's arrival, high school registrars \nrequest transcripts from any prior school indicated in student surveys completed at the \nintake clinic high schools. This information is used to create each student's initial High \nSchool Graduation Plan (HSGP).  As more information on each student arrives at the \nCEA high schools, programming needs are better defined. All future course placements \nare determined by need as indicated on updated transcripts. This information, as well as \ncourses completed, is used for updating HSGPs every six months. In order for students to \nearn a high school diploma or its equivalent, each CEA high school must be able to \nprovide access to an adequate number of instructional periods, scheduled school days and \ncourse offerings in each curricular area. Students that do not earn an average of five (5) \nhigh school credits each month, have poor attendance or school behavior problems are \nreferred  to  the  School  Consultation  Team  (general  education  students),  the  Special \nEducation  Team  (special  education  students)  and/or  the  Case  Conference  Team  (all \nstudents) process for evaluation and possible intervention plans. \nAn annual Academic Calendar shall be developed and approved by the Director of CY A \nby August 2005  and implemented by August 2006. This calendar includes a 220-Day \nAcademic Calendar (two 90 day semesters, a 30 day summer session and 10 professional \nstaff development days) and School Day Schedules (a minimum of 240 minutes shall be \nprovided each scheduled school day) package that will ensure that each eligible non \ngraduate will have access to a minimum 240 minute school day for 49 days and a 330 \nminute school day for 161  days providing 64,890 minutes of instruction annually. Each \nhigh school's School Day Schedule will provide time for compensatory education services \n(make-up lost time due to class cancellations).  Institutional program activities will be \nscheduled for students/wards during scheduled periods of non-instruction. \nC.  School Consultation Team (SCT) \nThe experts also stated that the CEA lacks uniformity in the identification and assessment \nof students who have not previously received special education services.  The experts \nreported that even though the Student Consultation Team (SCT) would routinely identify \nstudents in need of service,  SCT data revealed that students in restricted settings for \nextended periods oftime rarely receive early identification and referral services. \nAn effective and fully functional SCT will consist of an interactive process by a team \ncomposed of the student, general education teachers, a school administrator, the referring \nstaff member, and when appropriate, a living unit staff when behavior is the primary \nreason for the student's lack of progress in his overall school program or the reason for \nplacement in a restricted program.  The administrator responsible for special education \nservices, with technical assistance by the SB 505 Team, will ensure in-service training is \nprovided by April 2005 at each high school on SCT policy and procedures, including the \nuse of standardized SCT forms, and staffs role and responsibilities in this collaborative \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 27 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nprocess.  A tracking system developed by April 2005 will document the effectiveness of \nrecommended interventions and provides verification that on-going progress reviews are \nconducted. \nSchool administrators will collect data on the school's SCT activities each month in order \nto manage and evaluate their respective site's process.  This data will be a part of the \nPrincipal's Monthly Report submitted to the Superintendent of Education.  Together with \nthe Facility Superintendent, the Principal will work collaboratively to correct deficiencies \nas needed. \nD.  ATTENDANCE AND CLASS CANCELLATIONS \nThe experts reported that a six month review indicated an average of 20-30% of wards \nwere absent from school each day.  The experts also noted that there were inaccuracies \nidentified on some attendance  reports  and  that wards  in  all  main high  schools were \nobserved  being  pulled  from  general  and  special  education  classes  to  attend  other \nprograms.  The experts further stated, \"It is evident that education is not the primary focus \nduring the school day.\"  Teacher absences, the lack of substitute teachers, maintenance \nissues and security concerns are significant causes of class cancellations at all facilities.  It \nwas noted that class cancellations also contribute to the failure of the CYA   sites reviewed \nto provide special education wards with access to a minimum 240-minute instructional \nday. \nIn order to retrieve accurate information on student attendance, the CEA has developed a \nStudent/Ward Accountability Tracking (SWAT) system for tracking student enrollment \nand daily attendance in school.  The system, created by a multidisciplinary team including \nPrincipals,  Treatment  Team  Supervisors,  facility  Assistant  Superintendents  and \nSuperintendents  and  the  Deputy  Directors  of Institutions  and  Camps  and  Education \nServices, looks at all aspects of student movement into education programs and includes \ntracking information on class cancellations.  This attendance system will be integrated \ninto the current WIN database by July 2005  using the CY A and contract information \ntechnology staff.  Each institution's management team is responsible for reviewing the \nmonthly data from the SWAT Reports and using it to remove barriers prohibiting student \naccess to the required minimum 240 minute instructional day. \nThe Superintendent of Education and the Deputy Director, Institutions and Camps will \nreview statutes, regulations, policies,  SWAT data and practices relating to access and \nattendance  in  education  programs  by  July  2005.  They  will  develop  performance \nexpectations approved by the Director for attendance and access by July 2005, update \npolicy,  regulations  and  procedures  by  December  2005  and  department-wide  training \n(including for those working in restricted settings) will occur by December 2005. While \nthe  final  implementation  date  is  December 2005,  including  policies  and  procedures, \ninterim measures such as  site implementation of a standardized SWAT process,  data \ncollection, monthly reporting, monitoring and corrective action plans are already in place \nat each site. Students will be expected to attend school each scheduled school day except \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 28 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nfor verified medical conditions or when the student is an immediate threat to the safety of \nhimlher  self or  others.  A  memorandum  of understanding  will  be  developed  by  the \nDirector and signed by each affected Branch Deputy Director delineating a collaborative \neffort between education, custody and treatment will occur to ensure equal ward access to \nall programs.  The Director and hislher Executive Team will monitor enrollment and \nattendance  data  quarterly  from  each  site  to  ensure  compliance  with  laws,  codes, \nregulations, and policies regarding student attendance and access to education.  Initially \n(April 2005), all facility superintendents and high school principals will present to the \nDirector  and  hislher  Executive  Team  their  collaborative  plan  to  remediate  deficient \nstudent access and/or student attendance. After the initial presentation in April 2005 on a \nquarterly basis,  schools  with absence  rates  of 7%  and  higher will  continue to  make \npresentations and corrective action plans until the absence rate is below 7%. \nA \"program service day\" is being developed by an inter-branch work group selected by \nthe  Director to  be  implemented  by  June  2005  that includes all  components of ward \nservices (education, treatment, medical, etc.).  The School Scheduler will team with a \nTreatment Assignment Manager and will be the point person responsible for the whole \n\"program service day\" schedule, not just the school schedule or treatment schedule. Also, \ninstitutional teams will be required to develop incentives for increased school attendance \n(such  as:  BBQ's,  Family  Days,  Pizza  Days,  carnival  days,  site-wide  celebrations). \nInstitutional program activities will  be  scheduled for students/wards during scheduled \nperiods of non-instruction. \nEach institutional management team will identify a program service day schedule by June \n2005 that allows time for all treatment programs, educational programs, medical services, \ntraining and routine maintenance needs to be met during the work day/week without loss \nof mandatory program time. The education portion of the program service day will meet \nthe Director's adopted School Day Schedule requirements to  ensure compliance with \neducation  mandates.  Except  for  emergency  situations,  as  defined  in  the  Restricted \nProgram Manual, the scheduled education and treatment time shall not be used for other \npurposes. The Superintendent of Education will develop an Annual Academic Calendar \nby May 15th each year that includes a review of the Department's Master Calendar and \nprovides  for  staff training.  The  Annual  Academic  Calendar will  be  reviewed by the \nDirector's Executive Team (Chief Deputy and Branch Deputy Directors) and will  be \napproved by the Director.  The approved Annual Academic Calendar will include 44 \nStudent  Advising/Case  Conference  Days  from  the  days  that  teachers  and  education \nspecialists  are  scheduled  to  work  and  attend  case  conference.  These  Student \nAdvising/Cases  Conference  Days  will  be  included  in  the  annual  facility  calendar \ndeveloped  by  the  facility  Superintendent,  High  School  Principal  and  the  institution \nmanagement team. Exclusive education and treatment time will insure student attendance \nand  ensure  education  and  treatment  access  mandates  are  met.  With  all  teachers, \ninstructors and specialists on the same schedule for work days and unassigned days class \nclosures due to  teacher absence for  vacation will be eliminated.  As minimum school \nstaffing  levels  are  met  (including  minimum  levels  for  substitute  teachers),  class \ncancellations will be eliminated. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1, 2005  PAGE 29 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nIncreased staffing and instructional service hours will require additional and/or updated \ninstructional space to ensure access for all eligible students. A new study of adequacy of \ninstructional space based on increased staff and access to instructional services for each \neligible  student  shall  be  completed by May 2005.  In  2004  the  CYA adopted design \ncriteria and construction standards for academic and career-technical classroom space. \nMajor capital outlay funds were requested for instructional space in youth correctional \nfacilities. Additionally, a review to determine the need for temporary space and identify \nany available funding to support instillation of portable classrooms will be completed by \nJune 2005. \nAccess to  education services will  be  readily available to  those  students on lockdown \nstatus  longer than  72  hours  (see  also  Section III,  subsection E.  Restricted Settings). \nStudents assigned to restricted settings will have the same school day scheduled as the \nhigh  school  regular  education  program  and  will  be  scheduled  for  instruction .a nd \nsupplementary services individually or in small groups not to exceed 5 students. Students \nthat are determined to be a danger to themselves or others (temporary detention) may not \nbe served for the first 72 hours of temporary detention.  If a student remains in temporary \ndetention beyond 72 hours and it is determined that he/she can be served safely, education \nservices will be provided. If a determination is made that the student continues to be a \ndanger, the student can be placed in a restricted setting where full educational services \nwill be provided. There will be additional instructional staff as described in the Section II; \nby 2007-08 instructional space is being developed/upgraded where possible, and portable \ninstructional space will be purchased and installed. \nAs an integral part of the CY A treatment program each CEA high school shall use a \n. structured positive behavior management system in each classroom or service provider \narea consistent with adopted treatment modalities to be implemented with training by \nDecember  2005.  Within  each  high  school  there  shall  be  an  alternative  behavior \nmanagement classroom for early intervention short-term placements due to classroom or \nservice area behavior problems. \nEach high school has implemented a school improvement plan and a school improvement \nreview process to reevaluate and adjust schedules and teacher assignments as  student \nneeds  dictate.  The  planning  and  review processes  are  inclusive  of the  institutional \ncommunity at large including restricted settings. \nE.  RESTRICTED SETTINGS \nThe experts reported that the most systemic factor impacting wards placed in restricted \nprograms is CYA's failure to consistently provide all of these eligible students access to a \nminimum 240-minute instructional day.  Education services to students on the restricted \nprograms were found to be limited. \nThe IEP team will develop or will review and revise existing behavioral goals for special \neducation  students  who  are  placed  in  restricted  programs.  Services  to  all  general \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE300F50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\neducation and  special  education  students  in restricted settings are  delivered  in  small \nclassroom settings whenever possible. \nGeneral  education and  special  education are  required mandated services.  Each non \ngraduate  student  is  entitled  to  receive  the  minimum  school  day  requirement  of 240 \nminutes,  including  other  supplementary  services  such  as  special  education,  English \nlearner, etc.  These services will be provided individually or in small classroom settings. \nA BCP for the 2005-2006 fiscal year was submitted by the Superintendent of Education \nrequesting that each restricted program be staffed according to the appropriate staffing \nratio of 5: 1 to ensure a safe and secure learning environment. Staff assignments will be \nmatched  and  aligned  with  specific  course  offerings  as  well  as  with  credential \nauthorizations. \nHigh school administrators, along with their living unit counterparts, are responsible to \ninclude the following in supervising staff assigned to a restricted program: \n•  Use of a standardized format for reporting educational progress and data on \nstudents in a restricted program to the Principal and the Department Review \nCommittee \n•  Use of a standardized questionnaire or checklist by high school administrators to \nensure students in restricted programs are receiving their full  complement of \nmandated educational services \n•  In-service training for all education and living unit staff assigned to a restricted \nprogram regarding policy, guidelines, staff roles and responsibilities \n•  Technical assistance from the SB505 Team (DOE, CSCE/CSUSB) process to \nassist in the development of guidelines and effective strategies and techniques, \nfor students who are placed in a restricted program on a frequent basis \n•  In-service training and assistance provided by special education teachers and \nspecialists for living unit staff with effective strategies and interventions in \nworking with students with disabilities \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH],2005  PAGE 3] oF50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nEDUCATION SERVICES BRANCH \nCALIFORNIA EDUCATION AUTHORITY \nIV.  CURRICULUM \nA.  INTRODUCTION \nCurriculum and instruction services are designed to improve student achievement for all \nstudents.  California Education Authority (CEA) curriculum and instruction policies and \nprocedures  are  based  on  Welfare  and  Institutions  Code  related  to  education  in  the \nDepartment  of the  Youth  Authority  and  the  California  Education  Code  related  to \ncurriculum, instruction, and assessment. Education reforms at the state and federal levels \nhave  mandated  higher  academic  standards  for  all  students  and  redirected  the  K-12 \nemphasis toward increasing academic achievement to ensure future educational, career \nand labor market opportunities for all students. \nB.  CEA CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT \nThe CEA has a Curriculum Development and Review Plan and Procedure manual to \nguide  the  process  for  curriculum  development.  The  revised manual  is  aligned  with \nCalifornia's  standards-based  education  system.  CEA uses  the  Content  Standards  for \nCalifornia Public Schools and the Curriculum Frameworks for California Public Schools \npublished  by  the  California Department  of Education Press.  The  only areas  where \ncontent  standards  are  developed  by CEA  are  for  courses  of study that  do  not  have \nstandards  approved  by  the  State  Board  of Education.  In  this  event,  standards  are \ndeveloped  through  a  collaborative  process  using  standards  published  by  industry  or \nprofessional  associations.  The  Superintendent  of Education  oversees  the  curriculum \nprocess.  The process is managed by the District Curriculum Committee (DCC) through \nAd-hoc subject Curriculum Committees (ACC) using subject area expert Teachers on \nSpecial Assignment for these committees. \nC.  CURRICULUM GUIDES \nThe education experts noted that there is a need to complete the curriculum guides in the \narea of science and that the curriculum standards should be aligned with the California \nDepartment  of  Education  academic  content  and  performance  standards.  It  was \nrecommended that a system of electronic access be developed to ensure all staff have \nimmediate  access  to  the  guides.  The  experts  also  suggested  that  a  review  of the \nmathematics requirements for graduation be conducted to ensure that course standards are \nequivalent to public school requirements. \nThe CEA has curriculum guides in English language arts, mathematics, social science, \nand  is  in  the  process  of completing  the  science  guide  by  June  2005  aligned  with \nCalifornia's academic  content standards adopted by the  State Board of Education.  A \nCareer  Technical  Education Program  Curriculum  Guide  covers  the  major  vocational \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1, 2005  PAGE 32 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nprograms taught in the schools. The guides provided content and performance standards \nand a process for instruction and assessment designed to improve academic achievement. \nCourses of study are developed to meet requirements for high school graduation or its \nequivalent.  The core academic curriculum guides will be available electronically on the \nCY A Intranet by December 2005. \nThe  Mathematics  Curriculum  Guide  has  been  reviewed  and  aligned  with  the  state \nrequirements in mathematics for high school graduation. Ten credits in Algebra 1 are \nrequired for graduation.  Geometry is recommended but not required. \nThe  Science  Curriculum  Guide  will  reflect  the  revised  standards  of  developing \ncurriculum guides.  It is based on the Science Content Standards for California Public \nSchools and the Science Framework for California Public Schools published in 2003. \nCEA subject-matter curriculum specialists coordinate curriculum revisions and develop \ncurriculum guides on a cyclical basis completing one major content area revision every \ntwo years. \nD.  INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND TRAINING \nThe experts recommended that all  sites  conduct a yearly inventory of textbooks and \neducationally related non-consumable supplies.  They also noted that there is a need for \nlibrary  books  and  textbooks  in  the  living  units  at  all  sites.  The  experts  further \nrecommended that an Educational Leadership Academy be developed to internally train \npotential educational leaders for the CEA.  They stated that all educational leaders must \npossess appropriate credentials and skills thus necessitating ongoing training. \nUnlike  other  public  school  students,  CEA  students  receive  no  targeted  funding  for \ninstructional materials. The Budget Change Proposal (BCP) is the process CEA uses to \nrequest  additional  funding.  Within  state  and  federal  funding  guidelines,  CEA  uses \nexisting categorical funds to meet the instructional support needs of students. \nCEA  has  a  process  for  acquiring  instructional  materials.  CEA  has  standardized the \nselection of instructional materials and equipment needed for all courses of study.  Each \nsite will  complete an annual  inventory,  beginning August 2005  and annually,  of the \nadopted instructional materials and needs assessment to determine if additional materials \nand equipment are needed.  This information will be reported to CEA in advance of the \nannual budget cycle, so that budget augmentation for instructional materials funds can be \nwritten in a timely manner if no other funding is available.  The Director has placed a \npriority on approving budget augmentations  that  impact curriculum  and  instructional \nservices delivered to students. \nLibrary books and textbooks will be made available to students on the living units to \nprovide  extended  learning  opportunities,  for  doing  homework,  and  for  providing \nresources for reading practice.  The school librarian will maintain the inventory of these \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 33 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nmini-libraries.  For  the  purposes  of standardization,  Education  Services  Branch  will \nidentify the core books that will comprise the mini-libraries. \nFunding for staff development related to instructional support services faces the same \nproblem as funding for instructional materials. CEA will continue to develop and publish \nan annual training plan for the professional development and instructional support that is \nneeded to improve student learning and achievement including an Educators Academy for \nall new professional and instructional support staff. Existing funding sources will be used \nto collaboratively plan for training needs that cross categorically funded programs. \nAdministrator training will be provided through participation in the California School \nLeadership  Academy,  which  prepares  school  administrators  to  assume  instructional \nleadership roles.  CEA administrators will also participate in ongoing principal training \nprovided at the quarterly scheduled Principal's Meetings and by local County Offices of \nEducation.  Teacher leaders will be developed through opportunities to work on special \nassignments and participate in training opportunities developed by CEA. \nE.  CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND ADVISORY COMMITTEES \nThe experts also noted that Trade Advisory Committees should be implemented at each \nsite and employability studies should be conducted to determine how well students are \ntransitioning back to the community. \nThe Education Code requires all districts participating in a career technical education \n(CTE) program to appoint a CTE advisory committee to develop recommendations on \nthe program and to provide liaison between district and potential employers.  Each school \nsite Principal will develop a trade advisory committee or its equivalent by May 2005 \n(meeting quarterly) to provide local support and input in district-level planning. \nThe CEA administrator responsible for career-technical education will conduct Internet \nsurveys of the business occupational areas for CTE programs and develop a report for the \nSuperintendent of Education by July 2005 and subsequently annually. A survey of the \nCalifornia  Occupational  Outlook  Reports  for  San  Bernardino  County,  Los  Angeles \nCounty,  Sacramento  County,  San Joaquin County, Ventura County,  San Luis  Obispo \nCounty, and San Francisco County provides information for vocational course planning. \nThe CEA administrator responsible for career-technical education will conduct annual \ncareer-technical job studies to determine the  effectiveness of the CTE programs.  The \nresults of the studies will affect the career-technical programs that are provided. \nF.  EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY AND DISTANCE EDUCATION \nThe experts stated that technology hardware and software should be added at all sites to \naddress the wide range of learning modalities and to enhance the curriculum. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE340F50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nCEA is  increasing the  use  of computers to  enhance the  curriculum and provide and \naddress a wider range of learning modalities.  A separate student network at each high \nschool/correctional  facility  connects  classrooms,  the  library,  and  living  units.  An \nautomated library system will be installed at each high school providing tracking and \neasy access to library materials by June 2006. \nCEA is careful to consider the conditions under which distance education is appropriate \nas  a  learning  methodology for  students.  Distance-education courses for  high  school \ngraduation meet Content Standards for California Public Schools. \nA distance education delivery system provides opportunities for instruction in which the \nteacher and the student are in different locations and interact through the use of computer \nand communications technology.  Global Classrooms will be available at each site by \nJune 2006 to connect teachers and students for synchronous academic instruction when \nthe  needed  courses  are  not available  otherwise  and to  provide  instruction to  remote \nlocations such as  restricted programs.  The Corrections Learning Network, a distance \nlearning format  using broadcast instruction, provides General Education Development \nand  workforce  preparation courses.  The  use  of online courses to  provide  instruction \ndepends on overcoming security barriers. A pilot is in place at the NA Chaderjian High \nSchool.  A  contract  was  signed  in  September  2004  to  develop  distance-learning \ncapabilities at each CEA high school.  The project is scheduled for full implementation \nby June  2005;  in the  meantime,  an \"internet simulation\"  is  available  on the  student \nnetwork. \nDistance learning will be one method used to accommodate student needs in those hard \nto-recruit subject areas  such as  science and  math.  Distance learning will not exempt \nrestricted programs from the use of instructional staff to provide direct support services to \nstudents. \nG.  CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS \nThe experts reported that even though CEA Policy 4130: Instructional Practices calls for \nunit instructional plans to include course syllabi, units of instruction, and lesson plans, \nmany of the teachers visited were not using lesson plans, did not have standards posted \nand/or a course syllabus available for review. \nAt least quarterly classroom observations will be conducted by school administrators and \nfor the School Improvement Review process. The observations will be based on a rubric \nfor Classroom Observation that will be revised to align with the California Standards for \nthe Teacher Profession (CSTP). \nThe observation process will include an analysis of classroom productivity by examining \nsamples of student work for  alignment to  standards and time on task.  Evidence for \ninstructional planning will include use of written lesson plans, instructional maps, and/or \nunits of instruction.  Students will know what is expected of them by receiving a course \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 35 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nsyllabus  or course  outline that describes the  course content and requirements.  Each \nclassroom  will  have  posted  standards  and  benchmarks  for  the  courses  taught  with \nexamples of student work that meets and exceeds the standards and benchmarks. \nH.  CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION SUPPORT \nThe CEA response to the No Child Left Behind Act is a five-year strategic plan and a \nComprehensive  Reading  Initiative  to  improve  the  quality  of  instruction  in \nreading/language arts and mathematics. \nThe CEA Plan is built on five performance goals: Goal 1: All students will reach high \nstandards, at a minimum, attaining proficiency or better in reading and mathematics, by \n2013-2014;  Goal  2:  All  limited-English proficient students will  become proficient in \nEnglish and reach high academic standards, at a minimum, attaining proficiency or better \nin reading and mathematics; Goal 3: By 2005-2006, all students will be taught by highly \nqualified teachers; Goal 4: All students will be educated in learning environments that are \nsafe, drug-free, and conducive to learning; and Goal 5: All students graduate from high \nschool. Benchmarks for Goal I are: implement a reading literacy program (2004-2005), \nimplement a mathematics literacy program (2005-2006), align instruction with content \nstandards (2004-2006), utilize standards based instructional materials (2004-2006), and \nprovide staff development aligned with standards based instructional materials (2004-\n2006). \nThe first phase of the plan implemented at each high school by June 2005 addresses the \nreading/language  arts  curriculum.  The  CEA  Literacy  and  Language  Arts  Program \naddresses the needs of all learners through a state adopted reading intervention program \nand  a literacy-based core  high  school  literature  and  language  arts  program.  The two \nstandardized programs are based on current and validated research using a systematic \napproach to explicitly teach the California reading/language arts standards. Each program \ncontains multiple resources and uses methodologies for teaching English learners, special \neducation students, and struggling readers. The Literacy and Language Arts program is \nbased  on an  integrated,  leveled-learning  model  that  addresses  student learning needs \nbased on diagnostic placement testing, progress monitoring, and summative assessment to \nvalidate student achievement. Students are placed with peers who are at the same learning \nlevel with the most highly qualified teachers for that level. Intensive teacher training in \nthe  delivery  of the  sequenced  and  structured  programs  accompanies  each  program. \nReading  materials are  provided in Library Media Centers and  on the  living units to \nsupport independent reading.  Study time is provided on the living units outside of school \ntime  to  practice  reading  skills  and  develop  an  appreciation  for  reading.  The \nSuperintendent of Education is also committed to a literacy-based approach to science \nand social science curricula as each content area is revised in the curriculum cycle to \nensure students have multiple opportunities to develop the academic language, reading, \nand  writing  skills  needed  for  passing  the  CAHSEE  and  earning  their  high  school \ndiplomas. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE360F50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nThe next phase of the  strategic plan is  to  implement the  same plan and process for \nmathematics  by  June  2006.  The  Mathematics  Program  consists  of a  mathematics \nintervention program and a core high school mathematics program designed to address \nstudent-learning needs based on diagnostic  assessment.  State adopted standards-based \ninstructional programs and teacher training to deliver the programs are major parts of the \nimplementation process. \nI.  POLICY MANUALS \nThe experts recommended that all staff have access to current and complete educational \npolicies with consideration given to statewide electronic access. \nEducation policies will be kept current and complete. All CEA policies referenced in the \nremediation plan are in review and will be revised to reflect the reorganization of the \nDepartment  of Correctional  Services,  proposed  changes  in  operations  and  changes \nresulting  from  the  budget process.  All  staff members  will  have  electronic  access  to \neducational policies through the CY A Intranet by June  2006.  The  Special Education \nPolicy  Manual  will  be  approved  and  in  place  by  September  2005.  The  School \nImprovement Review process provides monitoring to ensure compliance with education \npolicies and procedures. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,1005  PAGE370F50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nEDUCATION SERVICES BRANCH \nCALIFORNIA EDUCATION AUTHORITY \nV.  SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES/RECORDKEEPING \nA.  INTRODUCTION \nCompliance with the federal mandate Public Lawl02-119, known as the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA), requires that the school district or local educational \nagency provide special education and related services to all disabled children at no cost to \nthe parents. \nSpecial education services are provided to eligible students in support of their main high \nschool core curriculum and IEP goals.  A team process consists of analysis and review of \na student's assessment results,  classroom work samples and behavior observations to \ndetermine eligibility under one of thirteen federal categories of disability or impairment. \nServices provide differentiated or specialized instruction, which addresses the student's \ndisability and the best program or service to support his/her classroom performance in the \ngeneral  education  curriculum.  The  full  continuum  of special  education  services  is \navailable at each CEA high school site (including satellite programs). \nB.  PROGRAM SUMMARY \nMarch 2004 data reveals that 27% of the non-high school graduates are identified as \nspecial education students (929  of 3400).  Seventy-eight percent of the  929  students \nrequire  more  than  one  special  education  program  or  service  as  designated  on  their \nIndividualized Education Programs (IEPs).  The majority of incoming special education \nstudents have been identified prior to entry into the Youth Authority system. \nThe Search and Serve process identifies all students entering the Youth Authority with a \nhistory of special education. (See attachment of Flow Chart with the Education Intake \nProcess description.)  The Intake and Court Services Unit verifies the receipt of IEPs of \nincoming juvenile commitments designated as special education or an individual with \nexceptional needs per Welfare and Institutions Code statute.  Screening oflEP documents \nat intake by designated education staff determines which course of action occurs next: \nCode 1 - The IEP is current and requires the CEA to implement services as \nindicated on the IEP or interim placement in comparable services.  An IEP review \nmeeting convenes within 30 days of arrival. Students are enrolled in general \neducation classes and special education services within four (4) school days of \narrival. \nCode 2 - The IEP is due or overdue for a three-year re-assessment.  A \nmultidisciplinary team develops an assessment plan that is included in the \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1, 2005  PAGE 38 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nnotification packet to parents for review and approval.  The IEP team convenes \nwithin 50 days from receipt of the parent's consent for assessment. Students are \nenrolled in general education classes and special education services within four \n(4) school days of arrival. \nCode 3 -Students entering without a verified history of special education \nplacement-are enrolled in general education classes within four (4) school days of \narrival.  However, if academic performance and/or behaviors emerge that \nnegatively impact their ability to progress; students may be referred to the School \nConsultation Team or directly to special education. \nQualified and trained assessment personnel administer a variety of test instruments in the \nspecific areas identified in the approved assessment plan designed to address all areas of \nthe known or suspected disability. When it is determined that standardized testing is not \nappropriate, alternative assessment will be described on the assessment plan. Test data \nand the analysis of the results are summarized in a standardized written report format. \nParent notification, assessment reports and the IEP document form the basis of the special \neducation student records file.  The complete file is transferred to the receiving school for \nfull implementation of the IEP within five school days of arrival. \nThe development of goals and objectives ensures that student needs are addressed and \nprogress is monitored according to benchmarks indicated on the IEP.  The least restrictive \nenvironment, using the full range of the inclusion continuum, is a primary consideration \nwhen identifying the specific program and/or service that best meet the student's specific \nneeds. The delivery of services is the responsibility of general education teachers, special \neducation teachers and specialists along with paraprofessional or support personnel as \ndesignated on the IEP.  School administrators monitor the implementation of services to \nensure eligible students are receiving a free appropriate public education (F APE). \nThe continuum includes placement options as follows and includes the full range of time, \nfrequency and duration within each option: \n•  Special Day Classes (SDC) - Services for students who need the most intensive and \nstructured environment due to their behavior and/or severity oftheir disabilities \n•  Resource Specialist Program (RSP) - Services for students who are integrated into the \ngeneral education curriculum for the majority of their school day and require support \nin their general education classes \n•  Designated Instruction Services (DIS) - Support services such as Language, Speech \nand Hearing services, Counseling, Adapted Physical Education, etc. \n•  General  Education  Classrooms  - Services  for  students  in  the  general  education \nclassroom setting through the use of accommodations and modifications provided by \nthe general education teacher, along with support, consultation and/or collaboration \nby special education personnel as designated on the IEP \nThese services are provided to all eligible students, including those assigned to restricted \nsettings. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1, 2005  PAGE 39 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PUN \n\nC.  CLINIC INTAKE PROCEDURES \nIn the area of testing and assessment for wards with cognitive and learning disabilities, \nevaluations developed were sometimes lacking information necessary to make informed \neducational decisions.  It is common for a student to be transferred from the diagnostic \nfacility with incomplete assessment data, which results in increased workloads at the \nreceiving institutions. \nTo  ensure  a  high  quality  intake  process,  assessment  practices  and  products  will  be \nupdated and standardized for the three reception centers-clinics by August 2005.  In \nservice training to both clinic and receiving school personnel will provide the guidance \nand  assessment tools  for  implementation of established policy and  procedures.  The \ntraining will include monitoring tools for school administrators at the clinics in evaluating \nwhether their  respective  processes  and  products  meet quality  and  quantity  standards \nestablished by CEA.  School administrators will report assessment completion rates as \nwell as other data to the Superintendent of Education on a monthly basis. The process \nbegan in October 2004 and will be implemented by August 2005; however, the county \nintake process will be completed by December 2005. \nBased on a memorandum of understanding approved by the Director and signed by the \nDeputy Director,  Institutions and  Camps and the  Superintendent of Education,  CEA, \nalong with the clinic administrators, will work collaboratively with the Intake and Court \nServices Unit to ensure compliance with regulations regarding the provision ofIEPs prior \nto the acceptance of the physical custody of the juvenile.  Such collaboration may require \nperiodic meetings with County personnel. \nD.  INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAMS (lEPs) \nAccording to the experts, the CEA has not been able to ensure full compliance at each \nsite with the development and implementation of IEPs.  Deficiencies cited in this area \ninclude inconsistencies in several mandated components of IEP development, review of \nstudent progress and implementation issues related to the time, frequency and duration \nlisted on the IEP. \nIn-service training starting December 2004 and ongoing will be provided to education, \ntreatment and custody staff. In support of serving special education students in all facility \nsettings  the  administrator  responsible  for  special  education  will  ensure  training  for \ntreatment and custody staff will be provided through the existing block training process. \nSpecial  education training  will  include  policies  and  procedures,  respective  roles  and \nresponsibilities, and guidance in the following compliance areas: \nAlignment of goals/objectives \nr:J \nPeriodic progress or benchmark reviews \nr:J \nConsideration of the least restrictive environment (LRE) \nr:J \nTransition services \nr:J \nAccommodations and modifications in the general education classroom \nr:J \nEDUCA nON SERVICES  MARCH 1, 2005  PAGE400F50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\no  Compensatory services \no  Accommodations and modifications in the living unit and treatment settings \nEach special education service provider will document students' progress according to the \ndates identified on hislher IEP goals and objectives.  In-service training will provide staff \nwith  standardized  formats,  procedures  and  explicit  directions  for  documentation, \nincluding  the  requirement  by  general  education  teachers  to  document  the \naccommodations and/or modifications to  the core curriculum that are provided in the \ngeneral education classroom by March 2005.  The Principal's Monthly Report will report \nthis data to the Superintendent of Education for monitoring and review. \nEach Principal will monitor at least monthly using the special education data reports the \ntimely review of IEPs, ensuring that each IEP is reviewed at least annually and more \nfrequently as needed.  Re-assessment or triennial assessments will be conducted within \nthe three-year time line established by state and federal regulations. \nCompensatory special education services will be provided whenever such services are \nmissed during the week or period of service delivery as designated on the IEP.  Policy \nrequires  that  all  special  education  personnel  meet  their  respective  service  time  as \ndelineated on IEPs, and that all  school administrators ensure that appropriate staff are \navailable and scheduled to deliver such services.  Monthly service provider reports will \nprovide data that measures whether personnel are meeting established criteria and provide \nadministrators  monitoring  tools  from  which  to  manage  local  and  regional  staffing \nresources.  If gaps of missed services occur, or are projected to occur, due to the lack of \nsubstitute coverage, and such services cannot be made-up during the course of the week \nor designated period of time,  the  administrator will  initiate a plan for  compensatory \nservices.  Notices regarding the  implementation of such services will be provided to \nparents and adult students. \nOther monitoring tools developed by the SB 505 Team (CEA, The Center for the Study of \nCorrectional  Education  CSUSB,  and  California  Department  of Education)  for  both \ndistrict and site administrators will be in place to ensure that below-standard performance \nis remedied through a corrective action plan. \nThe  Education  Stakeholders  Committee,  established  by  August  2005  (quarterly \nmeetings), will consist of departmental, other interagency participants, and community \nmembers, including parents of CEA students.  This committee acts as an advisory body to \nthe Superintendent of Education and the Department's Executive Team that will serve as \nCEA's governing \"school board.\" The advisory entity meets federal and state compliance \nrequirements for a community advisory committee.  This committee will contribute to the \ndevelopment  and  review  of CEA's  special  education  local  plan  as  well  as  provide \nrecommendations on how special education services can best meet the needs of students \nwith disabilities.  This committee will provide an open and public forum to ensure \nstudent educational needs are addressed while in a Youth Authority setting. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE410F50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nE.  Monitoring of special education compliance procedures \nEach  CEA school will maintain multiple copies of the  Special Education Policy and \nProcedures Manual for use and ready access by staff and school administrators.  Annual \ntraining will include compliance requirements, procedural updates, guidance along with \nspecific examples of best practices, implementation issues, etc. \nTo address on-going monitoring efforts, the Regional Program Specialists will conduct at \nleast quarterly site reviews of schools on a rotating basis as part of the CEA Master \nCalendar schedule. More frequent site reviews will be necessary to establish compliance \nand can be reduced to quarterly as maintenance of effort is assured. Program Specialists \nwill use a standardized protocol, developed by CDE,  as the primary monitoring tool. \nCompliance reviews by site school administrators will be a routine part of their required \nmonthly duties. Each school will develop a corrective action plan to address any non \ncompliant  items.  Progress  on  the  corrective  action  plan  will  be  submitted  to  the \nSuperintendent of Education for review and monitoring.  Beginning July 2005  each \nschool will conduct on at least an annual basis an \"educational benefit\" exercise with one \nor  more  IEP  cases.  School  administrators  will  lead  special  education  and  general \neducation staff in this interactive process that reviews a student's progress over a three \nyear period of time. \nTraining will be provided to all education staff and administrators; treatment and custody \nstaff and administrators as appropriate and other stakeholders as appropriate starting July \n2005.  Training will use the approved Special Education Manual, approved fotIns and \ndata collection systems.  The frequency of the training scheduled will be dependent on the \neach individual's role in the process and mayvary from quarterly to annually. \nReferences: \nEducation Services Branch Manual, Section 4340 \nComposite of Laws (specifically Education Code, Section 56300-56385) \nPublic Law102-119, known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), \nPart  B  (34  CFR  Parts  300  and  301  and  Appendix  C)  website: \nwww.kidstogether.orgiIDEA \nWelfare and Institutions Code, Section 1742 \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE420F50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nEDUCATION SERVICES BRANCH \nCALIFORNIA EDUCATION AUTHORITY \nVI.  CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM \nA.  INTRODUCTION \nThe  purpose  of the  California High  School  Exit Exam  (CAHSEE)  is  to  ensure  that \nstudents  who  graduate  from  high  school  can demonstrate  grade  level  competency in \nreading,  writing,  and mathematics.  Commencing with the  2005-2006  school year,  no \npublic school student in California will receive a high school diploma without passing the \nCAHSEE. The State Board of Education (SBE) was allowed one postponement of the \nCAHSEE.  However,  state  law  does  not  allow  the  SBE  to  provide  any  further \npostponements. \nEach  eligible  student  in  the  CY A  shall  have  access  to  each  mandated  educational \nassessment  and  shall  be  provided  the  appropriate  accommodations  required  in  the \nstudent's IEP. \nB.  CONTENT \nThe CAHSEE has two parts:  English-language arts (ELA) and mathematics. The ELA \ntest addresses reading content standards in grades  8,  9 and  10.  The mathematics test \naddresses content standards in grades 6 and 7 (including a grade 7 measurement and \nGeometry  strand),  and  Algebra  1.  The  grade  7  measurement  and  geometry  strand \nintroduces basic geometry. Because the geometry concepts on the Exit Exam are basic, \nthe  geometry  standards  are  included  in the  CEA's math curriculum guide  Algebra I \ncourse. Therefore, students are taught basic geometry concepts in their Algebra I course \nand have access to additional geometry information in the follow-up study guide given to \nall students. \nC.  TESTING \nStudents have multiple opportunities to pass the CAHSEE. Testing for 10th grade students \nresumed in 2004. During the 2004-2005 school year 10th  and 11  grade students who \nth \nhave not already passed the CAHSEE will be tested. The California Education Authority \n(CEA) has participated in all prior CAHSEE testing and continues to test students in \npreparation for the exit exam requirement.  CEA students graduating during the 2005-\n2006 school year and thereafter are required to pass the CAHSEE to earn a high school \ndiploma. \nIn  the  meantime,  CEA  uses  the  Comprehensive  Adult  Student  Assessment  System \n(CASAS)  tests  in  reading  and  mathematics  and  a  CEA  developed  writing  test  to \ndetermine grade level proficiency for graduating students. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1, 2005  PAGE 43 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nD.  TEST VARIATIONS \nStudents  must  be  allowed  to  take  the  CAHSEE  with  any  accommodations  and \nmodifications that are specified in their Individual Education Program or Section 504 \nPlan  for  use  on  the  CAHSEE,  standardized  testing,  or  for  use  during  classroom \ninstruction and assessment.  Test variations are also available to English learners who \nregularly use them in the classroom. Students who are eligible for test variations must \nadhere to the California Department of Education (CDE) guidelines for test variations. \nPrior to the testing period, all students with identified test accommodations and \nmodifications are identified and assessment coordinators will ensure testing variations are \nfollowed as outlined by CDE. \nE.  WAIVER PROCESS \nStudents who take one or both parts of the CAHSEE with a modification and receive the \nequivalent of a passing score are eligible for the waiver request process. The local school \ngoverning board may grant a waiver if the principal is able to certify that the student has \nmet the three conditions stipulated by the SBE. Students who are eligible will be granted \nwaivers based upon the process as outlined by SBE (State Board of Education Policy #01-\n07). \nF.  REMEDIATION' \nSchools are required by law to provide remediation to students who are at risk of not \ngraduating from high school. Currently, released test questions from previous tests and \nCAHSEE teacher guides are available. Each school has access to the released test items \nand the  guides  for teachers to use  in their class  instruction and review lessons.  The \nprincipal at each site has developed a plan to track student progress on the CAHSEE and \nprovide direct remediation for any student who has failed one or both sections of the test. \nG.  MONITORING \nEach  site  is  monitored  through  the  School  Improvement  Plan/School  Improvement \nReview process for implementation of the Literacy and Language Arts Program and the \nMathematics Program. Student achievement on the CAHSEE is monitored and evaluated. \nSchool Improvement Plans address efforts to improve student achievement in reading, \nwriting, and mathematics. \nEDUCA TJON SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 44 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nH.  ALTERNATIVES TO THE CAHSEE \nStudents who are unable to pass the CAHSEE have additional options.  Students may also \ntake  the  General  Education Development  (GED)  test  or the  California High  School \nProficiency Examination (CHSPE). CEA provides students with opportunities to pursue \nthese  high  school  equivalency certificates.  Students unable  to  achieve  a high  school \ndiploma or pass an equivalency test are awarded a Certificate of Course Completion in \nlieu of a high school diploma. \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 45 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nOFFICE OF EDUCATION SERVICES-YOUTH \nCALIFORNIA EDUCATION AUTHORITY \nDEFINITIONS \nAverage Daily Attendance (ADA)-the average number of students attending school. \nCalifornia Department of Education (CD E)-The state agency that monitors all school \ndistricts in the state of California. \nCalifornia Education Authority (CEA)- California Youth Authority's \"district\" name \nfor its correctional education authority (Welfare and Institutions Code,) \nCalifornia State Employee Association (CSEA) -the designated union for employees \nin education. \nCareer technical education (CTE)-vocational classes in the CEA high schools \nCross-cultural, Language, and Academic Development (CLAD)-the certification· \nissued by the Teaching Credentialing Commission for those who are certified in teaching \nstudents whose primary language is not English. \nDesignated  Instructional  Services  (DIS)-related  services  to  support  the  student's \nprimary educational placement; includes Speech/Language, Counseling, deaf interpreter \nservices, etc. \nEducation  Services  Branch  (ESB)-the  branch  of California  Youth  Authority  with \noverall responsibility of educational services to students \nEnglish Learner (EL)-students whose primary language is other than English. \nFree appropriate public education (F APE)-term that defines entitlement of services \nunder federal law to eligible students under the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct. \nFocus on Education and Treatment (FEAT)-the California Youth Authority initiative \nthat designates the collaboration of treatment and education. \nHigh School Graduation Plan (HSGP)-a summary plan of number of credits/services \ndeveloped for each student at intake and updated at least twice each year \nIndividualized  Education Program (IEP)-a document  developed  by  a team  for  an \neligible student which includes the specific goals and objectives based on stated needs, \nEDUCATION SERVICES  MARCH 1,2005  PAGE 46 OF 50 \nREMEDIAL PLAN \n\nspecial  education  programs  and  servIces,  transition  activities,  and  other  required \nelements. \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)-Federallegislation signed in June \n1997 which outlines the requirements for local education agencies to provide services to \neligible  students  meeting  eligibility  criteria,  and  provides  guidelines  for  parent \nparticipation and notification, assessment procedures, and IEP development. \nLanguage,  Speech  &  Hearing Specialist  (LSHS)-a designated  instructional  service \ndesigned to meet the needs of students who may have impairments in speech, auditory \nprocessing, memory, hearing, etc. \nManagement Services Technicians (MST)-or coordinators of special education services \nthe support personnel assigned to track paperwork and time lines for special ed students; \nacts as \"custodian\" of special education records \nNo Child Left Behind (NCLB)-Federallegislation signed in 2001 that requires stronger \naccountability,  greater  flexibility  and  local  control,  enhances  parent  choice  and \nemphasizes effective teaching methods. \nResource Specialist Program (RSP)-a special education service designed for ·students \nplaced in general education classrooms for the majority of the school day and who \nrequire academiclbehavioral support \nDistrict  Curriculum  Committee  (DC C)- The  CEA  committee  responsible  for  all \ncurriculum  development  and  implementation.

Executive Summary \n \nThis report is intended to evaluate access to the programs and services of the California Youth \nAuthority (CYA) for wards with disabilities.  The report is based upon site visits and interviews \nconducted at eight institutions from September through December, 2004, by the author.  It also \ninvolves  a  review  of  applicable  policy  and  procedure  manuals,  previous  expert  consultant \nreports, and other written documentation about the CYA's programs that affect wards with \ndisabilities. \n \nThe  term  \"wards  with  disabilities\"  includes  all  those  who  can  be  reasonably  classified  as \n\"qualified individuals with a disability\", as defined by applicable federal and state law, including \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973  (Section  504),  and  the  Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act  of  1990  and  the \nAmendments of 1997 (IDEA).  While many persons may associate individuals with disabilities \nprimarily as those with physical impairments, the broader range of qualified individuals includes \nthose with mental and emotional disabilities, those who have certain infectious diseases or other \nlimiting conditions, and those who may be treated or regarded as disabled through misdiagnoses \nor misconceptions.  One of the recommendations of this report is that CYA staff should be made \nmore aware of this broader aspect of disability and of the additional rights and protections \nindividuals with all disabilities have under federal and state law. \n \nThe basic approach to the scope of inquiry required of the disability expert consultant and of this \nreport has always been that it should be a cooperative effort that primarily attempts to improve \nthe delivery of programs and services to wards with disabilities.  While the questions posed as \nthe major areas of inquiry are in a yes/no format, the reality is that few of them can be answered \nso simply. \n \nIn nearly all of the areas of inquiry, the CYA demonstrates a number of strong assets and policies \nthat need to be continued and strengthened.  In fact, my observations showed that the CYA has \nprogressed in a number of areas since the onset of the Farrell vs. Harper/Allen litigation and in \nresponse to the other expert consultants' reports.  Many within the CYA appear to be committed \nto making the changes necessary for appropriate reform. \n \nHowever, there are still a number of program areas where policies and procedures, as well as the \npractical implementation these policies, do not meet accepted standards of delivery or care for \nmedical  procedures,  mental  health  treatment  programs,  grievances,  disciplinary  activities, \neducational activities, and other program areas.  While all wards within the system are negatively \nimpacted by these deficiencies, wards with disabilities are disproportionately affected to a more \nsignificant  degree  than  other  wards,  since  many  programs  are  not  making  the  necessary \nmodifications necessary for equal inclusion and treatment of wards with disabilities into the \nPage 1 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nprograms.  Accommodations for wards with disabilities, as required by the applicable laws and \nregulations, are often limited and inconsistently provided. \n \nThe root cause of many of the problem areas lies predominantly in the lack of resources and \nappropriate funding for the CYA and its individual programs.  Ward population has decreased \ndramatically within the last several years.  However, rather than using these decreases as an end \ntoward strengthening program delivery, cutbacks have severely curtailed programs that were \nbeing developed and making a positive impact for wards.  And again, most of the program cuts \nmost negatively affect wards with disabilities, since these wards indeed need more specialized \napproaches to integrate them into regular institutional activities.  Unless funding and resources \nfor  treatment  programs,  educational  and  vocational  activities,  and  specialized  programs  are \nincreased, recommendations for overall and long-term improvements in program delivery will be \nmore difficult to achieve.  During times of economic stress, a reallocation of resources toward \nmore specialized programs for wards with disabilities will be necessary to make any appreciable \ngains in program delivery for this protected group. \n \nThe CYA's greatest asset lies in the expertise, dedication, and commitment of its staff, who for \nthe most part, perform their functions with distinction.  Both regular and special education \nteachers appear to be adept at modifying their teaching methods and tailoring the curricula to a \nwide variety of needs, including the individual needs of students with mental and learning \ndisabilities.  Psychologists work admirably on a day-to-day basis with an incredible array of \nchallenges posed by so many wards with mental and emotional disabilities.  These are just two \nexamples where service problems can be primarily attributed to the simple fact that there are just \nnot enough of either teachers for daily classes or psychologists for required treatment programs.  \nClasses are too often cancelled for the lack of teachers, and the lack of consistency in the \neducational process most often negatively affects students with disabilities.  Psychiatrists and \npsychologists carry caseloads that are dramatically above any acceptable professional standards \nof care, and treatment programs for wards with psychiatric disabilities are lacking because of it. \n \nEfforts to promote progressive treatment options are usually stymied by a lack of resource \ncommitment.  An exception is the Specialized Behavioral Treatment Program for wards with \nmental disabilities at Sequoia Lodge at Preston Youth Correctional Facility.  While the results \nare inconclusive as to the overall effectiveness of this program, the point to be made is that \nefforts for improvement can only occur with a shift in both resources and perspectives to foster \nchange.  For example, it has been suggested that a new treatment model for wards with serious \ndevelopmental disabilities must be developed, as the current trend toward relegating such wards \nto more restrictive programs is clearly inappropriate and ineffective.  Without the appropriate \nresource commitment, progressive solutions will be difficult if not impossible to implement, and \nthese wards will be denied their legal right to equal treatment in the least restrictive environment. \n \nPage 2 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nWhile this report does not specifically address physical accessibility, a previous expert's report \nclearly  documents  the  extent  and  nature  of  architectural  barriers  that  are  present  at  most \ninstitutions.  There is a distinct parallel between physical accessibility and program accessibility, \nthe subject of this report.  For example, newly constructed visitation centers at two institutions, \nboth reflecting positive reinforcement for family intervention as well as full accessibility, sit \nvacant and unused on visiting days because there is insufficient funding to adequately staff the \nfacility, thus denying full access to the visitation program for wards and family members with \nphysical  disabilities.    The  architectural  barrier  items  contained  in  the  surveys  should  be \nprioritized  and  implementation  begun  to  allow  for  full  access  to  programs  at  all  required \nlocations. \n \nIn conclusion, despite excellent and dedicated professional staff and a stated commitment to \nmaking improvements in a number of program areas, many of these areas fall short of the \nstandard of care necessary for the effective delivery of these programs to wards.  And when \nprogram delivery standards are deficient and resources are scarce, the group most negatively \naffected is those with disabilities, who often require, and are guaranteed by law, modifications \nand accommodations necessary for equal treatment and program access.  Such is the current state \nof  affairs  for  wards  with  disabilities  within  the  CYA.    On  a  positive  note,  with  a  stated \ncommitment to improve conditions for all of its wards, and with an appropriate reallocation and \nhopefully an improvement in resources, it is believed that the CYA can proceed on a positive \ntrack to bring about the needed improvements. \n \n \n \nPage 3 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n2.  Introduction - Scope of Work (Inquiry), Methodology, and Acknowledgements \n \nThis report has been prepared to evaluate access for wards with disabilities to the programs and \nservices of the California Youth Authority (CYA).  The report has been prepared in response to \nthe Complaint in the litigation entitled Farrell vs. Harper (Superior Court of California, County \nof Alameda, RG-03079344) and to the Consent Decree entered in the same case (now entitled \nFarrell vs. Allen). \n \nScope of Work (Inquiry) \n \nThis Consultant's basic scope of work was to prepare a detailed analysis addressing each of the \nareas of inquiry, as described below, at each of the identified institutions.

O.H. Close Youth Correctional Facility, Stockton, CA., Sept. 16-17, 2004. \n2.  N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility, Stockton, CA., Sept. 27-28, 2004. \n3.  Ventura Youth Correctional Facility, Ventura, CA., October 7-8, 2004. \n4.  Southern Youth Correctional Reception Center/Clinic, Norwalk CA, Oct. 14-15, 2004 \n5.  Heman G. Stark Youth Correctional Facility, Chino, CA., October 28-29, 2004. \n6.  El Paso De Robles Youth Correctional Facility, Paso Robles, CA., Nov. 3, 2004. \n7.  DeWitt Nelson Youth Correctional Facility, Stockton, CA., December 9, 2004. \n8.  CYA Training Center, Stockton, CA., December 9, 2004. \n9.  Preston Youth Correctional Facility, Ione, CA., December 16-17, 2004. \n(3) Careful evaluation and categorization of all programs, activities, policies, procedures, and \nprotocols, both agency-wide and at each facility. \n(4) Preparation of this report, including recommendations for revisions to programmatic \npolicies and procedures for inclusion in the disabilities remedial plan. \n \nAs a summary, it is believed that all ward living units within the CYA, with a possible exception \nof about five, were visited during the site visits, totaling about 95 living units.  In addition, \nwards'  visiting  areas,  dining  halls,  chapels,  educational  facilities,  recreational  facilities, \ntemporary  detention  facilities,  and  medical  and  mental  health  treatment  facilities  and  were \nvisited at all correctional facilities.  A total of about 120 staff members were either formally \ninterviewed or involved in more informal discussions.  Also, a total of about 45 wards, most with \ndisabilities, were interviewed or individually evaluated.  In most cases, names of staff or wards \nare not included in this report, for confidentiality reasons. \n \nThe general protocol for each site visit was that I was able to control the methods and locations \nof all review activities.  While the CYA staff and the visit coordinator did indeed schedule \nvarious interviews, and not all activities were necessarily available at all times at all locations, it \nwas I who determined what areas to see and whom to interview.  All members of the CYA staff \nwere gracious and helpful in accepting this concept. \n \nI generally started each site visit with an introduction from staff members about the make-up of \nthe programs and a tour of the facility.  I attended any formal meetings or hearings that might be \ntaking place.  I met with the grievance coordinator and the disciplinary decision making system \n(DDMS) coordinator.  I also usually spoke with the health and safety officer, the facilities and \nPage 8 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nmaintenance manager, or other supervisors.  I visited living units where wards were housed, as \nwell as the chapels, dining halls, gymnasiums, and recreational facilities.  I toured the school \nfacilities, met with the principal at each, and visited regular and special education classes.  I also \nreviewed wards' files and records and interviewed wards whom I selected. \n \nIt should be noted that, in general, the site visits were undertaken with a open dialogue about \nwhat was being observed, and that where conditions existed that might be readily corrected and \nresolved, sometimes those conditions were brought to the attention of those who could bring \nabout appropriate solutions.  Since the Consent Decree was in the process of being formally \nexecuted, it was not my intent to \"catch\" the CYA in possible \"violations\", but rather to work in \nconcert to bring about the most effective policies for wards' access to programs.  CYA staff \nindicated an interest in learning about better ways to do things and indeed exhibited an honest \nattempt to improve conditions whenever issues were raised.  For example, at a comprehensive \nlevel, the CYA was quick to respond to the need for ADA Coordinators to become more active \nin resolving issues, as further described in Section 3.3.  As another example at a more detailed \nlevel, when it was discovered that a ward with a hearing impairment had difficulties accessing \nclosed captioning on television, the problem was immediately corrected.  It should be also noted \nthat some conditions I observed required further reflection and research, and those conditions are \nprimarily described in this report. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nI would like to personally thank and acknowledge the efforts of all CYA staff and others who \naccompanied me during my site visits and inspections, and who were instrumental in setting up \nthe procedures that assisted in this report.  First and foremost would be Holly Bowers, Treatment \nTeam  Supervisor  at  N.A.  Chaderjian  Youth  Correctional  Facility  and  the  CYA's  recently \ndesignated ADA Coordinator for Programs, who organized all of the site visits, took extensive \nsite notes, and was invaluable in her assistance throughout the project.  Attorneys from the \nCYA's Legal Department, Sherleen Redd, Nanette Rufo, Abel Ramirez, and Van Kamberian, \nwere cordial and helpful when accompanying me on the site visits and in providing whatever \ninformation I requested.  Krista Pollard, attorney with the Attorney General's office, was also \nhelpful  and  assisted  me  throughout  my  site  visits,  inspections,  interviews,  and  meetings.  \nEveryone  within  the  CYA  provided  me  with  the  utmost  respect  and  cooperation  in  the \nperformance of my duties.  I was able to visit every part of every facility that I wanted to see.  I \nwas able to review all of the documents and materials that I requested at each site, and at no time \nwas  any  information  or  any  part  of  a  facility  withheld  from  me.    I  met  with  either  the \nSuperintendent or the Acting Superintendent of each facility and was able to obtain information \nabout the facility from the most senior personnel.  I believe that everyone was striving to provide \nme with honest answers to my questions and with their honest evaluation of their functions and \nhow the facility operated.  I was able to privately interview or informally converse with all the \nwards that I requested interviewing, and I was able to attend Board hearings, CYA advisory \nPage 9 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \ncouncil  (YAAC)  meetings,  case  management  conferences,  and  other  meetings  at  my  own \ndiscretion. \n \nI would also like to thank the previous expert consultants, as listed in the subsection Documents \nReviewed, who prepared expert reports on various aspects of the operations of the CYA in the \nFarrell vs. Harper/Allen matter.  It should be noted that while the subjects of the other expert \nreports were different from the subject of this report, their subjects were nevertheless related to \nthe overall area of services provided to wards, including those with disabilities, and there are \noverlapping issues and conditions that would affect both the general population and wards with \ndisabilities.  It should also be noted that I did not receive nor review the expert consultant reports \nuntil the first part of December, 2004, and therefore, I had completed most of my site visits and \nevaluations before reviewing the other expert reports.  This may have been helpful in forming \nmy own opinions as opposed to being swayed by the opinions and conclusions put forward by \nthe other expert consultants.  In general, it is not my intent to compare my opinions and \nconclusions with those of the other experts, and the reader of this report will need to compare the \nopinions and recommendations contained in this report with those of the other expert consultants \nto cover all of the parallels or differences between the various reports.  However, in some cases, I \ndo not share the same opinion as other expert consultants, and in those cases, my report might \nhighlight  differences  between  my  opinions  and  those  shared  by  another  expert.    In  these \ncircumstances, I acknowledge and apologize for a somewhat unfair advantage over the other \nexpert consultants, since I have had access to their opinions while they did not have access to \nmine nor are given the opportunity to clarify or rebut.  But I also believe that all parties are \nprimarily interested in an open dialogue of issues and potential solutions. \n \nCorrections and Errata \n \nIf there are any material facts contained or referenced in this report that are in error, please let me \nknow immediately, and I will be happy to make the appropriate corrections and issue errata, if \nnecessary. \nPage 10 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n3.  Federal and State Requirements \n \nThis section is intended to describe some of the basics of disability regulations and policies.  I \nfeel that such a discussion is necessary before responding to the specific areas of inquiry.  While \nit was my observation that CYA staff were generally concerned about the ADA and other \ndisability regulations and attempted to meet their requirements, a number of staff members also \nhad misconceptions or a lack of detailed knowledge about what the ADA and other state and \nfederal regulations would require in the programs offered by the CYA.  Many decision-making \nstaff  members  tended  to  think  of  disability  mostly  in  terms  of  physical  and  architectural \nparameters, or in terms of special accommodations that could be made for persons who might \nhave  easily  identifiable  special  needs.    There  sometimes  appeared  to  be  a  general  lack  of \nunderstanding about program access and how programs should be accessible to a wide range of \ndisabilities, irrespective of whether persons with disabilities are actually engaged at the present \ntime in the program.  CYA staff seemed to understand that employees with disabilities would \nhave the need for reasonable accommodation, but how wards would be accommodated within all \nof the programs that are offered to the general ward population was more difficult for some to \ncomprehend.  It is true that this distinction is a difficult one to describe and to understand, and \nyet it is also felt that it is a critical one in the treatment of wards with disabilities within the \nCYA.  (I realize that some of the information discussed below is included in the 8/2003 Draft of \n\"Youthful Offenders with Disabilities\", but that document, as far as I am aware, has not been \nwidely circulated to staff.  In addition, the discussions below present the information from a \ndifferent perspective than the Draft document.) \n \n3.1  Qualified Persons with Disabilities \n \nMost senior-level staff members were aware of physical disabilities, but it did not appear that \nsome possess a working knowledge of the broad range of disabilities that might be covered by \nthe ADA.  This section is intended to describe how the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n(ADA),  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973  (Section  504),  and  other  disability \nregulations should be used to determine which wards could be covered under the ADA or \nSection 504.  The words \"could be\" are used above, because regulations do not dictate absolute \ninclusion or disability protection for a specified list of impairments, but rather gives objective \ncriteria  that  requires  an  evaluation  of  an  individual's  specific  situation  and  whether \ndiscrimination has occurred or can be a potential issue. \n \nThe ADA has a three-part definition of disability.  This definition, based on similar definitions \nunder Section 504, reflects the specific types of discrimination experienced by people with \ndisabilities.  Accordingly, it is not the same as the definition of disability in other laws, such as \nstate workers' compensation laws or similar federal or state laws that provide benefits for people \nwith disabilities and disabled veterans. \n \nPage 11 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nUnder the ADA and related State regulations, an individual with a disability is a person who: \n1.  has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities, \n2.  has a record of such an impairment, or \n3.  is regarded as having such an impairment. \n \nEach of these criteria is described more fully below. \n \n(1) An Impairment that Limits Major Life Activities \n \nThe first part of the definition has three major subparts that further define who is and who is not \nprotected by the ADA. \n \n    A Physical or Mental Impairment: \n \nA physical impairment is defined by the ADA as:  \"[a]ny physiological disorder, or condition, \ncosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems:  \nneurological,  musculo-skeletal,  special  sense  organs,  respiratory  (including  speech  organs), \ncardiovascular,  reproductive,  digestive,  genito-urinary,  hemic  and  lymphatic,  skin,  and \nendocrine.\" \n \nA mental impairment is defined by the ADA as:  \"[a]ny mental or psychological disorder, such \nas mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning \ndisabilities.\" \n \nNeither the ADA nor Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations list all conditions or diseases that \nmake  up  \"physical  or  mental  impairments\",  because  it  would  be  impossible  to  provide  a \ncomprehensive list, given the variety of possible impairments.  Under the ADA, an impairment is \na physiological or mental disorder; simple physical characteristics, such as eye or hair color, left-\nhandedness, height or weight within a normal range, are not impairments.  A physical condition \nthat is not the result of a physiological disorder, such as pregnancy, or a predisposition to a \ncertain disease would not be an impairment.  Similarly, personality traits such as poor judgment, \nquick  temper  or  irresponsible  behavior,  are  not  themselves  impairments.    Environmental, \ncultural, or economic disadvantages, such as lack of education or a prison record, also are not \nimpairments.  \"Stress\" and \"depression\" are conditions that may or may not be considered \nimpairments, depending on whether these conditions result from a documented physiological or \nmental disorder. \n \nA person who has a contagious disease has an impairment.  For example, infection with the HIV \nvirus is an impairment.  Additionally, the Supreme Court has ruled that an individual with \ntuberculosis that affects the respiratory system had an impairment under Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. \nPage 12 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \n     Major Life Activities \n \nTo be a disability covered by the ADA, an impairment must limit one or more major life \nactivities.  These are activities that an average person can perform with little or no difficulty.  \nExamples are: \n•  working             •  seeing \n•  speaking            •  hearing \n•  breathing           •  learning \n•   performing manual labor  •  caring for oneself \n•  sitting            •  standing \n•   reading           •  lifting \n•  walking \nThese are only a few examples.  Other activities can be major life activities, and it is anticipated \nthat the list can change from time to time as qualities of life and normal activities also change. \n \n     Limits \n \nAn impairment is a \"disability\" under the ADA if it limits one or more major life activities.  An \nindividual  must  be  unable  to  perform,  or  be  limited  in  the  ability  to  perform,  an  activity \ncompared to an average person in the general population.  The regulations provide the following \nthree  factors  to  consider  in  determining  whether  a  person's  impairment  limits  a  major  life \nactivity: \n•  its nature and severity; \n•  how long it will last or is expected to last; \n•  its permanent or long term impact, or expected impact. \n \nThese factors must be considered because, generally, it is not the name of an impairment or a \ncondition that determines whether a person is protected by the ADA, but rather the effect of an \nimpairment or condition on the life of a particular person.  Some impairments, such as blindness, \ndeafness, HIV infection or AIDS, are by their nature limiting, but many other impairments may \nbe disabling for some individuals but not for others, depending on the impact on their activities. \n \nThe determination as to whether an individual is limited must always be based on the effect of an \nimpairment on that individual's life activities.  Sometimes, an individual may have two or more \nimpairments, neither of which by itself limits a major life activity, but that together have this \neffect.  In such a situation, the individual has a disability. \nPage 13 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \n     Temporary Impairments \n \nPublic entities, service providers, and employers frequently ask whether \"temporary disabilities\" \nare covered by the ADA.  How long an impairment lasts is a factor to be considered, but does not \nby itself determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA.  The basic question is \nwhether an impairment \"limits\" one or more major life activities.  This question is answered by \nlooking  at  the  extent,  duration,  and  impact  of  the  impairment.    Temporary,  non-chronic \nimpairments that do not last for a long time and that have little or no long-term impact usually \nare not disabilities. \n \n     Specific Exclusions \n \nA person who currently uses illegal drugs is not protected by the ADA as an \"individual with a \ndisability\".  However, former drug addicts who have been successfully rehabilitated may be \nprotected by the Act.  (See also the discussion below for a person \"regarded as\" a drug addict.) \n \nHomosexuality and bisexuality are not impairments and therefore are not disabilities covered by \nthe  ADA.    The  ADA  also  specifally  states  that  the  term  \"disability\"  does  not  include  the \nfollowing sexual and behavioral disorders: \n•   transvestism,  transsexualism,  pedophilia,  exhibitionism,  voyeurism,  gender  identity \ndisorders not resulting from physical impairments, or sexual behavior disorders; \n•   compulsive gambling, kleptomania, or pyromania; or \n•   psychoactive substance use disorders resulting from current illegal use of drugs. \n \n(2) Record of a Limiting Condition \n \nThe discussion in the previous subsection focused on the first part of the definition of an \n\"individual with a disability,\" which protects people who currently have an impairment that \nlimits a major life activity.  The second and third parts of the definition protect people who may \nor may not actually have such an impairment, but who may be subject to discrimination because \nthey have a record of or are regarded as having such an impairment. \n \nThis part of the definition protects people who have a history of a disability from discrimination, \nwhether or not they currently are limited in a major life activity.  It protects people with a history \nof cancer, heart disease, or other debilitating illness, whose illnesses are either cured, controlled \nor in remission.  It also protects people with a history of mental illness. \n \nThis part of the definition also protects people who may have been mis-classified or mis-\ndiagnosed as having a disability.  Examples of individuals who have a record of disability, and of \nPage 14 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \npotential violations of the ADA if a service provider relies on such a record to deprive the \nindividual of a program or service, are included below: \n \n•  A  person  formerly  was  a  patient  at  a  state  institution.    When  very  young,  she  was \nmisdiagnosed as being psychopathic and this misdiagnosis was never removed from her \nrecords.  If this person is otherwise qualified for a service and is not provided the service, \nthat is a violation of the ADA. \n \n•   A person who has a learning disability wants a position as a secretary/receptionist.  The \nprovider reviews records from a previous employer indicating that he was labeled as \n\"mentally  retarded.\"    Even  though  the  person's  record  shows  that  he  meets  all \nrequirements for the job, the provider does not interview him because he doesn't want to \nhire a person who has mental retardation.  This is a violation of the ADA. \n \n•  A person was hospitalized for treatment for cocaine addiction several years ago.  He has \nbeen successfully rehabilitated and has not engaged in the illegal use of drugs since \nreceiving treatment.  This person has a record of an impairment that substantially limited \nhis major life activities.  If he is qualified to receive a service or perform a task, it would \nbe discriminatory to reject him based on the record of his former addiction. \n \nIn the last example above, the individual was protected by the ADA because the drug addiction \nwas an impairment that substantially limited his major life activities.  However, if an individual \nhad a record of casual drug use, the person would not be protected by the ADA, because casual \ndrug use, as opposed to addiction, does not substantially limit a major life activity. \n \nTo be protected by the ADA under this part of the definition, a person must have a record of a \nphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. \n \n(3) Regarded as Limited \n \nThis part of the definition protects people who are not limited in a major life activity from \ndiscriminatory  actions  taken  because  they  are  perceived  to  have  such  a  limitation.    Such \nprotection  is  necessary,  because,  as  the  Supreme  Court  has  stated  and  the  Congress  has \nreiterated, \"society's myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the \nphysical limitations that flow from actual impairments.\"  The legislative history of the ADA \nindicates that Congress intended this part of the definition to protect people from a range of \ndiscriminatory actions based on \"myths, fears and stereotypes\" about disability, which occur \neven when a person does not have a limiting impairment. \n \nAn individual may be protected under this part of the definition in three circumstances: \n \nPage 15 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n(cid:131)  The individual may have an impairment that is not limiting, but is treated as having such \nan impairment.  For example, a worker has controlled high blood pressure that does not \nlimit his work activities.  If an employer reassigns the individual to a less strenuous job \nbecause of unsubstantiated fear that the person would suffer a heart attack if he continues \nin the present job, the employer has \"regarded\" this person as disabled. \n \n(cid:131)  The individual has an impairment that is limiting because of attitudes of others toward the \ncondition.  For example, an experienced assistant manager of a convenience store who \nhad a prominent facial scar was passed over for promotion to store manager.  The owner \npromoted a less experienced part-time clerk, because he believed that customers and \nvendors would not want to look at this person.  The employer discriminated against her \non the basis of disability, because he perceived and treated her as a person with a \nlimitation. \n \n(cid:131)  The individual may have no impairment at all, but is regarded by an employer as having a \nlimiting impairment.  For example, an employer discharged an employee based on a \nrumor that the individual had HIV disease.  This person did not have any impairment, but \nwas treated as though she had a limiting impairment.   \n \nThis part of the definition protects people who are \"perceived\" as having disabilities from service \ndecisions based on stereotypes, fears, or misconceptions about disability.  It applies to decisions \nbased on unsubstantiated concerns about productivity, safety, insurance, liability, attendance, \ncosts of accommodation, accessibility, workers' compensation costs or acceptance by others.  \nAccordingly, if a service provider makes an adverse decision based on unsubstantiated beliefs or \nfears that a person's perceived disability will cause problems and cannot show a legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reason for the action, that action would be discriminatory under this part of \nthe definition. \n \nQualified Persons with a Disability under the IDEA \n \nUnder the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 and Amendments of 1997 and \n2004 (IDEA), a person under 22 years of age is defined (in general) as a person with a disability \nif the person has one or more of the following limiting conditions: \n(1) mental retardation        (7) autism \n(2) is deaf or hard of hearing      (8) traumatic brain injury \n(3) speech or language impairment    (9) other health impairment \n(4) visual impairment        (10) specific learning disability \n(5) emotional disturbance      (11) is deaf / blind \n(6) orthopedic impairment      (12) is \"multi-handicapped\" \n \nPage 16 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nSince the CYA is a public agency required to provide a free appropriate public education to its \nwards and is thus subject to the requirements of IDEA, all wards with the above impairments \nshould be included in the definition of \"qualified persons with a disability\".  It should be noted \nthat the ADA's definition is potentially broader than those contained in IDEA.  Also, wards \nabove the age of 21 would also be regarded as \"qualified persons with a disability\" under the \nADA, even though required educational services under IDEA may lapse (in other words, the \nactual disability or its perception does not disappear just because a certain age is reached). \n \nCYA Wards with Disabilities \n \nBased upon the above definitions and discussions of \"qualified persons with a disability\", it is \nappropriate to apply ADA, 504, IDEA, and State disability regulations to wards under the \njurisdiction of the CYA.  Again, it is important to recognize that a disability must be evaluated \nbased on the specific impairment, or perception of an impairment, of the individual.  Still, it is \nappropriate  to  describe  generalized  categories  of  impairments  that  may  be  either  currently \nexhibited by a number of wards, or may be expected to be present in the general population of \nwhich wards are a part, even if no current wards with such an impairment are housed at the \nCYA.  This latter necessity will be made clearer after review of the next section concerning \nprogram accessibility. \n \nThese generalized categories include, but are certainly not limited to, the following: \n(1) persons with mobility impairments (may be multiple categories): \n(a) persons with spinal cord injuries or congenital impairments. \n(b) persons using wheelchairs, scooters, etc., either on a full-time or part-time basis. \n(c) persons using other mobility devices, including prosthetic(s), crutches, cane, walker, \netc. \n(d) persons with impaired manual dexterity, including possible use of manual aids or \nprosthetics. \n(2) persons with visual impairments: \n(a) persons with no vision, or who are blind.  (Note that the misnomer \"legally blind\" \ndoes not have particular application under the ADA.) \n(b) persons with low vision. \n(c) persons with other visual impairments or limiting conditions, such as cataracts, \nglaucoma, macular degeneration, reduced field of vision, myasthenia gravis, retinitis \npigmentosa, etc. \n(3) persons who are deaf or hard of hearing (It should be noted that the term \"hearing \nimpairment\", and degrees of distinction between varying degrees of hearing, are avoided \nin this report, since these terms are potentially offensive to many deaf and hard of \nhearing individuals.) \n(4) persons with speech impairments. \n(5) persons with mental or emotional disabilities: \nPage 17 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n(a) persons with developmental disabilities, including mental retardation or perceived \nlow IQ, traumatic brain injury, etc. \n(b) persons with emotional disabilities, including anxiety disorders, depression, etc. \n(c) persons with other psychological impairments or psychiatric conditions or disorders, \nincluding Tourette's syndrome, pervasive development disorders, anorexia nervosa, \netc.  (Note that DSM or \"Axis\" categorization of psychological impairment have no \nparticular application under the ADA.) \n(d) persons specifically covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (also \ncalled Individuals with Specials Needs (IWSN) in the Act). \n(6) persons with specific long-term diseases or potential debilitating conditions, including \nAIDS/HIV, tuberculosis, chronic pain syndrome, etc. \n \nIt is also helpful to clarify the extent to which persons with disabilities as described above were \neither known or observed to be housed at the eight CYA institutions during my site visits.  \nAgain, the relative numbers are not necessarily relevant, because the CYA has a legal obligation \nto  provide  programmatic  access  to  all  such  individuals,  as  described  in  the  next  section.  \nHowever,  such  a  discussion  should  be  valuable  in  analyzing  both  the  nature  of  the  CYA \ncompliance efforts to date and the extent of any additional services or program modifications that \nneed to be effected.  The actual numbers and percentages of the total of approximately 3,570 \nwards given below are approximate, and subject to change literally on a daily basis. \n \n(a) Wards with mobility impairments \n \nDuring my site visits, it is believed that there were eight individuals who had mobility or \northopedic disabilities.  I had some degree of interaction and formally interviewed most of them.  \nThree of the individuals had prosthetic limbs, one individual had permanent spinal injuries and \nresulting walking impairments, one individual had a physiological brain injury that limited upper \nbody movement, one individual had a spinal injury and used a wheelchair during my visit (with \nan unknown prognosis of permanency), one individual had scolioses, one individual had an \nunknown condition but needed a cane, and one individual had a missing appendage with an \nassociated lack of manual dexterity.  These individuals were housed at Chaderjian YCF, Ventura \nYCF, SYCRCC/Norwalk, Stark YCF, El Paso de Robles YCF, and DeWitt Nelson YCF. \n \nThis number of eight individuals with mobility impairments (only 0.22%) is statistically lower \nthan one would expect, given a total ward population of about 3,570.  I made some general \ninquiries as to why such would be the case, but quickly realized that such an evaluation would be \nbeyond the scope of this report.  The answer relates more to the state of the juvenile justice \nsystem in California, and involves County courts and the California Department of Corrections \n(CDC) as much as the CYA.  However, at a general level, the low number of wards with \nmobility impairments, while seemingly a positive sign since many of the older facilities exhibit \narchitectural barriers that would make daily life at the CYA difficult in some cases, may also \nPage 18 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nrepresent an area of concern.  If wards with mobility impairments are being denied entry into \nCYA facilities and its treatment and other special programs solely on the basis of their disability, \nor upon a real or perceived impression that the CYA cannot adequately house such individuals, \nthat would be a violation of the ADA.  (In other words, the question may be better put forward \nas: If wards with mobility impairments are not being sentenced to the CYA, where else are they \ngoing and what programs are available to them?)  During my site visits, I found no creditable \nevidence that the CYA was party to such a policy.  However, my scope of inquiry did not include \nan evaluation of the juvenile justice system to determine if other entities or agencies might be. \n \nFor the purpose of my areas of inquiry, I primarily evaluated the programs and services I \nobserved and their affect on the known wards with mobility impairments, which albeit was a \nsmall number, but still represented a range of disabilities.  However, at a secondary level, I also \nevaluated program access for those currently non-existent wards with mobility impairments that \nwere underrepresented in the overall population, assuming that their presence could indeed be a \nreality at any time. \n \n(b) Wards with visual impairments \n \nDuring my site visits, it is believed that there were at least 25 and possibly as many as 50 wards \nwith visual impairments.  (It should be noted that CYA's Outcome Measure Report for the Fiscal \nYear 03-04 lists as many as 39 wards with vision impairments for the greatest incidence in one \nmonth, with as few as 16 in the lowest month. While fluctuations are to be expected, it is unclear \nwhy the fluctuations are this great.)  The exact number is unknown, and relates to the larger issue \nof an accurate determination of a \"qualified individual with a disability\", as discussed previously.  \nMy work scope did not include a need to identify all such wards, even if such had been \npractically possible, which it would not have been.  I had some degree of review or interaction \nwith or formally interviewed about 12 wards with visual impairments.  Three of these individuals \nwere blind in one eye, one individual had macular degeneration, one individual had retinal nerve \ndamage, and the remainder had varying degrees of low vision or other visual impairments. These \nindividuals were housed at Close YCF, Chaderjian YCF, SYCRCC/Norwalk, Stark YCF, El \nPaso de Robles YCF, and Preston YCF. \n \nIn general, it appeared to me that the CYA was doing an adequate job of identifying and \nrecording  wards  with  visual  impairments,  with  one  major  exception.    This  involves  the \nineffectiveness of low vision screening through the medical intake procedures, as discussed \nfurther in Section 4.2.  Once such wards are identified, it is my opinion that the CYA is doing an \ninadequate  job  of  providing  accommodations  and/or  auxiliary  aids  to  wards  with  visual \ndisabilities.  In addition, the medical services components are not proceeding effectively with \nappropriate treatment or other medical procedures, with long-term negative effects being a real \npossibility in a number of cases. \n \nPage 19 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n(c) Wards who are deaf or hard of hearing \n \nDuring my site visits, it is believed that there were approximately 25 wards who were deaf or \nhard of hearing.  (The CYA's Outcome Measure Report for the Fiscal Year 03-04 lists only the \ncategory \"Hearing Aid\" with between 3 and 11 wards listed, but I believe the number of those \nwho are hard of hearing is actually higher.)  There were two known wards who were deaf with \nno hearing acuity.  My work scope did not include a need to identify all such wards, even if such \nhad been practically possible, which it would not have been.  I had some degree of interaction \nwith  or  formally  interviewed  about  12  wards  who  were  deaf  or  hard  of  hearing.    These \nindividuals were housed at Close YCF, Chaderjian YCF, Ventura YCF, Stark YCF, and El Paso \nde Robles YCF. \n \nIn general, it was unclear if the CYA was doing an adequate job of identifying and recording \nwards who are deaf or hard of hearing.  Once such wards are identified, it is my opinion that the \nCYA is doing an inadequate job of providing accommodations, program modifications, and \nauxiliary aids and services to wards who are deaf and hard of hearing, as discussed in Sections \n4.2 and 4.8.  Also, the medical services components and the mental health treatment programs \nare not proceeding effectively with appropriate medical procedures and other treatment, with \nlong-term negative effects being a real possibility in some cases. \n \n(d) Wards with mental, emotional, or learning disabilities \n \nBased upon statistics from special education records, psychiatric and psychological records, and \nmy own observations, I have estimated that at least 1,400 and potentially as many as 2,000 wards \nhave mental, emotional, or learning disabilities, as defined by the ADA and Section 504.  While \nthese disabilities are not necessarily similar and represent diverse needs, the intent of this section \nis to generally depict the numbers of wards involved, and my observations did not allow me to be \nable to break down these numbers more definitively.  These numbers would generally include, \nbut not be limited to, those wards who are currently identified and/or undergoing treatment \nprograms, as well as wards enrolled in special education.  It is possible that the number is higher, \nas the Stanford/Steiner Report seems to indicate.  The exact number is unknown, and relates to \nthe larger issue of an accurate determination of a \"qualified individual with a disability\", as \ndiscussed previously.  My work scope did not include a need to identify all such wards, even if \nsuch had been practically possible, which it would not have been.  I had some degree of \ninteraction with or formally interviewed at least 35 wards who were believed to have mental, \nemotional, or learning disabilities. \n \nIn general, I found that the CYA was using reasonable efforts to attempt to identify such wards; \nhowever, due to the sheer numbers involved and the lack of necessary resources, there are \ncertainly a number of wards that are not identified at all or who are mis-identified.  Once \nidentified, it is my opinion that the CYA is doing an inadequate job of providing services to \nPage 20 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nwards with mental, emotional, or learning disabilities, as discussed in Sections 4.3 and 4.6.  \nOverall, the mental health components are not proceeding effectively with treatment programs, \nprimarily due to a mis-allocation and/or a lack of available resources. \n \n(e) Wards with specific diseases or other conditions \n \nIt is believed that that as many as 100, and possibly more, wards have disabilities related to their \ndiseases or limiting health conditions, as defined by the ADA and Section 504.  The exact \nnumber is unknown, and relates to the larger issue of an accurate determination of a \"qualified \nindividual with a disability\", as discussed previously.  My work scope did not include a need to \nidentify all such wards, and such an extensive review of detailed medical files and diagnoses \nwould have been impossible for my allocated extent of work.  I had some degree of interaction \nwith or formally interviewed several wards who were believed to have such disabilities. \n \nIn general, I found that the CYA was using reasonable efforts to attempt to identify such wards.  \nHowever, there are certainly a number of wards that are not identified at all or are mis-identified.  \nI do not have an informed opinion about the CYA's medical treatment of these wards, but do \nbelieve that many of these wards are not advised of their rights and protections under the ADA. \n \nPage 21 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n3.2  ADA Title II Requirements \n \nAs a state government public entity, the CYA has various obligations under Title II of the ADA, \nthe part that regulates state and local governments.  Title II of the ADA is similar to Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, but differs in that Section 504 applies only to government \nagencies that receive federal financial assistance.  The purpose of Section 504 is to ensure that no \notherwise qualified individual with disabilities shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be \ndiscriminated against under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.  The \nADA specifically states an intent not to apply lesser standards than are required under other \nfederal, state, or local laws; therefore, the law which is the most stringent has precedence.  This \nintent has particular application with respect to the CYA’s obligations under Section 504 or \nunder  Title  24  of  the  California Code  of  Regulations,  which  in  some  cases,  exceed  ADA \nrequirements with respect to structural and physical changes. \n \nTitle  II  of  the  ADA  mandates  that  public  entities  may  not  require  eligibility  criteria  for \nparticipation in programs and activities that would screen out persons with disabilities, unless it \ncan be proven that such requirements are necessary for the mandatory provision of the service or \nprogram.    A  public  entity  must  reasonably  modify  its  policies  and  procedures  to  avoid \ndiscrimination toward persons with disabilities.  However, if the public entity can demonstrate \nthat a modification would fundamentally alter the nature of its service, it would not be required \nto make that modification.  The lone exception to these requirements would be because of undue \nhardship.  “Undue hardship” is defined in the ADA as an “action requiring significant difficulty \nor expense” when considering the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size, \nresources, and structure of the specific operation. Undue hardship is determined on a case-by-\ncase basis. \n \nUnder Title II, public entities are required to prepare a self-evaluation and transition plan to \nassess  its  program  and  services  to  assure  that  all  potentially  discriminatory  practices  are \nidentified  and  removed.  They  are  required  to  designate  a  person  to  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  the  implementation  of  ADA  requirements  and  for  investigating  complaints  of \nalleged noncompliance.  The ADA states that a public entity is required to make available to \napplicants, participants, and other interested parties information regarding the self-evaluation and \ntransition plan and its applicability to the services, programs, or activities of the public entity. \n \nA  public  entity  is  required  to  apprise  its  program  recipients  as  well  as  the  public  of  the \nprotections  against  discrimination  afforded  to  them  by  the  Title  II  of  the  ADA,  including \ninformation  about  how  these  requirements  apply  to  its  particular  programs,  services  and \nactivities.  A public entity that employs 50 or more persons is required by the ADA to adopt and \npublish  grievance  procedures  providing  for  prompt  and  equitable  resolution  of  complaints \nalleging any action that would be prohibited. \n \nPage 22 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nDOJ regulations describe the requirements for “program accessibility”.  A public entity shall \noperate each service, program, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, so that it is accessible to \nand usable by individuals with disabilities.  The ADA does not necessarily require the public \nentity to make all of its existing facilities accessible, nor does it require a public entity to take \nany action that would fundamentally alter the nature of a service, program, or activity.  There are \nvarious methods that may be appropriate for providing “program accessibility”. \n \nUnder Title II of the ADA and Section 504, the term “program or activity” embraces all of the \nprograms, activities, and services offered by a covered entity in fulfillment of its mission.  A \npublic entity must also consider the entire scope of its overall operation as one program made up \nof several parts or elements.  In conducting the program review, it should examine each of the \nparts or elements that make up the whole.  The public entity should ensure that its entire program \nis readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. \n \nWith respect to existing facilities, a public entity may not make only one facility or a limited \nportion of facilities accessible if the result is to segregate persons with disabilities in a single \nsetting.  Also, where special programs offering different curricula or treatment techniques are \navailable, the range of choice provided to persons with disabilities must be comparable to those \noffered  to  persons  without  disabilities.    For  support  facilities,  such  as  restrooms,  drinking \nfountains,  and  parking  spaces  in  existing  facilities,  sufficient  numbers  of  these  accessible \nelements  should  exist  that  are  reasonably  convenient,  usable  in  inclement  weather,  and \nappropriate to the use of a facility.  Usage of facilities is also an important factor in addressing \nprogram accessibility concerns.  Buildings in which an individual may spend extended periods of \ntime should meet a higher degree of accessibility than those in which an individual spends \nrelatively short periods of time. \n \nAlthough nonstructural methods of achieving program accessibility are acceptable, nonstructural \nsolutions should not have the effect of segregating people with disabilities or compromising their \ndignity and independence.  In choosing among various methods for achieving program access, a \npublic entity must give priority to methods that offer programs or activities in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate. \n \nIt  is  important  to  understand  that  whether  a  particular  program  or  activity  is  accessible  is \ndetermined not by compliance with an architectural accessibility standard but by considering \nwhether the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable \nby individuals with disabilities.  However, in an assessment of program accessibility in existing \nfacilities,  facility  accessibility  standards  such  as  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act \nAccessibility  Guidelines  for  Buildings  and  Facilities  (ADAAG)  or  the  State  of  California \nBuilding Code accessibility code items (usually referred to as Title 24) may be used as a guide to \nunderstanding whether individuals with disabilities can participate in the program, activity, or \nservice. \nPage 23 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nBefore responding to the specific areas of inquiry as described in Section 4, it is appropriate to \nattempt a correlation between physical and programmatic access.  In the context of the Farrell v. \nHarper/Allen matter, a previous review of architectural accessibility was undertaken and reports \nprepared by another expert consultant, Access Unlimited.  These reports include detailed access \nbarrier surveys for five of the facilities I visited (Ventura YCF, SYCRCC/Norwalk, N. A. \nChaderjian YCF, O. H. Close YCF, Dewitt Nelson YCF), but did not include three of the \nfacilities (Heman G. Stark YCF, El Paso de Robles YCF, and Preston YCF).  My scope of work \ndid not include any detailed architectural barrier identification, but rather, I was to utilize the \nprevious reports.  My scope of work involved access to programs and services, not access to \nfacilities.  Nevertheless, there are overlaps between the two areas, particularly where a physical \nlocation houses a necessary program or service in a unique location.  My report typically will \nnote, on a general level but not at the detailed level included in the architectural barrier reports, \nwhere physical barriers interfere with program access.  It does not dictate final architectural \nsolutions, or even indicate if alternate programmatic solution may be available.  Therefore, it is \nincumbent upon the CYA to correlate the two reports (as well as complete architectural barrier \nsurveys at the three facilities not covered in the Access Unlimited reports) and to prioritize the \nrequired barrier removal activities. \n \nPage 24 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n3.3  ADA Coordinator(s) Position and Duties \n \nUnder Title II of the ADA, any public entity with fifty or more employees must designate at least \none employee to coordinate ADA compliance.  The regulations refer to this person, or persons, \nas  the “responsible employee or employees\", but the more commonly used term is “ADA \nCoordinator(s).”  It is important to note that public agencies that are subject to Section 504 and \nemploy fifteen or more persons must designate at least one person to coordinate their Section \n504 compliance activities. The same individual can coordinate ADA and Section 504 compliance \nactivities. \n \nThe ADA Coordinator is the key player in ensuring ADA compliance.  The ADA Coordinator’s \nrole  includes  planning  and  coordinating  overall  compliance  efforts,  ensuring  that  the \nimplementation  is  completed,  and  receiving  and  investigating  complaints  related  to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability.  To fulfill the job duties, the ADA Coordinator must \nhave the authority, knowledge, skills, and motivation to implement the regulations effectively. \n \nOne purpose of this requirement is to ensure that members of the public (or in this case, wards \nand  guardians)  can  readily  identify  a  person  who  is  familiar  with  ADA  and  Section  504 \nrequirements and can communicate those requirements to other key staff.  It is expected that this \nemployee will have the authority to take whatever action is needed to correct problems.  It is also \nrequired, however, that the agency make an effort to prevent violations by ensuring that all of its \nemployees and agents are familiar with their obligations.  In order to ensure that individuals can \neasily identify the ADA Coordinator, a public entity must provide the ADA Coordinator's name, \noffice address, and telephone number to all interested individuals. \n \nCalifornia Youth Authority's ADA Coordinators \n \nAs described in Section 2, Methodology, it was our usual procedure during the site visits to \ndiscuss issues and procedures openly.  One issue that arose, and was routinely discussed with the \nSuperintendents at each institution, was the need for an active ADA Coordinator to oversee ADA \ncompliance at each facility.  One of the most positive of all of the CYA's responses to issues \nraised during the site visits was for the CYA to institute a system of interim ADA Coordinators \nat both the agency-wide and individual facility levels. \n \nEffective November 10, 2004, Yvette Marc-Aurele, Deputy Director of the Institutions and \nCamps  Branch,  named  Holly  Bowers,  Institutions  and  Camps  Branch,  and  Nick  Giannini, \nFacilities Planning Division, to serve as the Department’s interim ADA Coordinators.  Questions \nand concerns regarding ward access to programs, services and activities were to be referred to \nHolly Bowers, and all issues regarding physical plant accessibility were to be referred to Nick \nGiannini. \n \nPage 25 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nThe recent CYA policy memorandum did not specifically address the responsibilities and duties \nof the two agency-wide ADA Coordinators.  They should oversee a variety of tasks related to \nimplementation of the ADA regulations and organize the CYA’s on-going compliance efforts.  \nSpecific duties that I would recommend for inclusion in the ADA Coordinators' job descriptions \ninclude the following tasks (how these are divided between the two ADA Coordinators should be \ndetermined by the CYA): \n1)  Coordinate the development, refinement, and implementation of the policies and plans for \ncomplying  with  the  requirements  of  the  ADA,  as  well  as  other  disability  laws.  \nCollaborate with staff from various departments in developing and reviewing plans and \npolicies in their areas of responsibility under the ADA. \n2) Develop strategies for informing employees, managers, and other groups about policies \nconcerning the accommodation of wards, parents and guardians, employees, applicants, \nand visitors with disabilities. \n3)  Monitor and evaluate compliance with the requirements of the ADA and other disability \nlaws.  Advise and consult with managers, supervisors, principals, and the heads of the \nunits about areas of concern and possible non-compliance with regulations.  Recommend \nappropriate corrective action, as needed. \n4)  Maintain a working knowledge of legislation that is specifically related to the treatment of \npersons with disabilities.  Maintain a working knowledge of architectural accessibility \nregulations  and  codes,  including  those  in  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act \nAccessibility Guidelines and the California State Building Code (Title 24) Accessibility \nStandards.  Monitor federal and State of California legislation and regulations, rulings by \ngovernmental enforcement agencies, and court cases for developments that might affect \npolicies and procedures. \n5)  Investigate and resolve complaints and grievances alleging either failure to comply with \nADA regulations or discrimination on the basis of disability. \n6)  Assist legal staff or outside attorneys in response to any civil litigation on ADA matters. \n7) Prepare periodic reports in response to requests by government agencies, staff, other \noffices, and the public. \n \n8) Maintain  liaison  with  the  Parole  Board,  the  Superintendent’s  Office,  school  site \nprincipals, and other administrators to promote coordination of compliance approaches, \npolicies, and procedures regarding equal access and accommodation of persons with \ndisabilities. \n9)  Collaborate with the Personnel / Employment offices to implement employee reasonable \naccommodation  requests  regarding  physical  access  issues  for  staff  and  potential \nemployees. \n10)  Collaborate with the public information office regarding issues related to press releases \nand public relations related to the ADA. \nPage 26 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nIt was also requested in the memorandum that each Superintendent designate a person at each \ncorrectional facility that is currently in a managerial/supervisory position to serve as the Facility \nADA Coordinator. As of December 10, 2004, the following have been named to these positions: \nPreston YCF  Mike Roots, TTS \nO.H. Close YCF  Hector Amezquita, Captain \nDeWitt Nelson YCF  Scott Miller, TTS \nN. A. Chaderjian YCF  Holly Bowers \nEl Paso de Robles YCF  Jim Bonnefield, HSO \nVentura YCF  Rod Basinger, TTS \nSYCRCC/Norwalk  Liam Cowan, Program Admin. \nHeman G. Stark YCF  Sandra Huyg, TTS \nPine Grove Camp  Larry McGuire, TTS \nWashington Ridge Camp  Sandra Wrigth, TTS \nBen Lomond Camp  DaVirto Artis, TTS \n \nThe above Facility ADA Coordinators will be responsible for identifying wards assigned to their \nfacility  that  may  have  a  disability  or  impairment  that  would  require  a  special  service  or \naccommodation,  as  well  as  ensuring  that  appropriate  services  are  provided.    The  ADA \nCoordinator will assume a leadership role in preparing the facility for monitoring tours and \ncompliance reviews and act as a liaison with the Department’s ADA Coordinators. \n \nA description of the Facility ADA Coordinator responsibilities, as given by the CYA in its \ncorrespondence initiating this system, is listed below: \n1)  Coordinate and monitor the facility’s overall compliance with state and federal laws \nand the Disabilities Remedial Plan. \n2)  Establish  a  system  to  ensure  communication  between  custody,  medical/clinical, \ntreatment and education staff regarding the needs of wards with disabilities in the \nfacility. \n3)  Act as liaison between the facility and headquarters staff and other state entities. \n4)  Assume a leadership role in preparing the facility for monitoring tours and compliance \nreviews. \n5)  Ensure that all pertinent staff is present for monitoring tours. \n6)  Assume overall responsibility for the disability verification process at facilities and/or \nreception centers/clinics. \n7)  Ensure that all staff receive training and follow up training on ADA compliance and \ndisability awareness. \n8)  Monitor the facility’s tracking system and ensure that appropriate staff is aware of ward \nneeds under the Disabilities Remedial Plan. \n9)  Ensure that the facility maintains a contract for sign language interpreter services, as \nwell as a record of use of this service.   \n10)  Maintain a file of all ADA complaints, grievances and appeals.  Conduct periodic file \nreviews to identify ADA issues raised and evaluate the facility’s performance. \nPage 27 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nOne aspect that was unclear from the CYA's November 10, 2004, memorandum was how the \ncurrent workload of those named to be Agency-wide or Facility ADA Coordinators would be \nmodified so that they could also assume the new duties.  My evaluation of the positions already \nheld by these persons indicates that most are already at or beyond the limits of what their \nexisting job functions entail.  Acting as an ADA Coordinator should not add additional time \nconstraints to the already stressed staff schedules.  The CYA should clarify this point, and \nprovide additional staff to take on some of the other duties of the ADA Coordinators and reduce \ntheir current workloads. \n \nSince the November 10, 2004, memorandum came from the Institutions and Camps Branch, the \napplication to the Parole Branch was not covered.  Interviews with parole agents indicated that \nthere  were  concerns  even  from  these  agents  about  ADA  compliance.    Therefore,  I  would \nrecommend that at least one and possibly two (one for the north and one for the south) ADA \nCoordinators also be named for the Parole Branch. \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Make the interim Agency-wide ADA Coordinator positions, one for Program Access and one \nfor Physical Access, permanent designations.  Allot at least half-time hours to the fulfillment \nof the duties as described above. \n2.  Make the designations of the Facility ADA Coordinators permanent.  Allot at least quarter-\ntime hours for the fulfillment of the duties as described above. \n3.  Provide in-service training for both the Agency-wide and Facility ADA Coordinators, with \ntraining provided by outside trainers/consultants (see Section 5.1). \n \n4. Name  at  least  one  and  possibly  two  (one  for  the  north  and  one  for  the  south)  ADA \nCoordinator(s) for the Parole Branch. \nPage 28 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4. Specific Areas of Inquiry - Do wards with disabilities have access to programs and \nservices in a manner consistent with federal and state law? \n \nThe primary scope of work for this task involved 15 specific areas of inquiry regarding access to \nprograms and services within the CYA for wards with disabilities.  The specific areas of inquiry \nwere posed as 15 subdivisions of the basic question posed above, worded to receive either a \n\"yes\" or \"no\" response.  As is usually the case, such questions cannot really be answered as a \ndefinitive \"yes\" or \"no\", but are best answered by gradations between.  The fact is that for all of \nthe 15 distinct areas of inquiry regarding wards programs and services, the CYA provides a \nreasonable degree of access in some areas and falls short of providing access consistent with \nfederal and state law in other areas.  This report has been prepared to describe those programs \nand policies that appear to work well for wards with disabilities, so that these can be continued \nand properly funded.  It has also been prepared to pinpoint those areas where deficiencies are \npresent and where the lack of compliance with applicable regulations make access to programs \nand  services  difficult  or  impossible  for  wards  with  disabilities.    The  distinction  between \n\"difficult\" and \"impossible\" as used in the preceding sentence is a crucial one, because as \nexplained in Section 3.1, disability regulations should revolve around the needs of the person, \nnot a particular disability or impairment.  What might be accessible for one person with a \ndisability might not be accessible to another with a similar disability. \n \nThese 15 specific areas of inquiry are answered in the following subsections.  There are often \noverlaps between the various areas of inquiry (for example, education and communications), and \ntherefore some areas may be covered in other sections, with the intent being to avoid duplication. \nPage 29 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.1  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards' with Disabilities Access to Screening and Assessment \n \n(a)  General Intake and Assessment \n \nInitial  screenings,  assessments,  and  testing  are  currently  given  at  the  three  intake  facilities \n(SYCRCC/Norwalk, Preston YCF, and Ventura YCF), and these include a battery of interviews, \nforms, and tests intended to gauge a variety of potential problems and issues for incoming wards. \n \nWhen a ward first enters the CYA, males currently enter either the southern intake unit at \nNorwalk or the northern unit at Preston.  Females enter the only women's facility at Ventura.  \nProcedures are generally standardized, although there are variations at each facility.  At Norwalk, \nfor example, medical exams are administered first, while at Preston, these are administered later \nin the process.  Medical screening is discussed more fully in Section 4.2. \n \nThe initial orientation for a ward each facility is individual, with a case management specialist \nmeeting with the ward to explain basic procedures.  I sat in on several of these and found the \nCYA staff member to be cordial and effective.  The standard procedure is that the ward fills out a \nnumber of forms and is also initially evaluated at this juncture.  Even though IEP's and general \nneeds are discussed, there is no specific mention of the ADA and the ward's rights under federal \nand state requirements.  I feel that this would be a good time to briefly discuss the ADA and \nrelated disability regulations and to obtain formal consent that the ward was so instructed, \npreferably by one individual at each intake facility properly trained to undertake this task.  \nHowever, this would not substitute for more extensive ward ADA training, as discussed later. \n \nI will forego a description of all the procedures for screening and assessment, as there are a \nbattery of forms for these purposes.  I was not able to sit in on any actual screenings, and to do so \nwould have most likely been inappropriate.  Therefore, I do not know what procedures are \nfollowed at this juncture to assure that wards with communication issues are accommodated \nappropriately, or if wards are advised that they have the right to alternative formats if needed.  I \nfelt that all staff serving as initial screeners were sincere in their stated desire to accurately assess \nthe wards' abilities and issues, and have no reason to believe that necessary accommodations are \nwithheld at this point.  Nevertheless, since the process is an extensive one anyway, I would \nsuggest that an new initial screening form be prepared that analyzes both the ward's and the staff \nmembers ability to communicate effectively for the intake process (see also Section 4.8). \n \nOne particular form that needs amending is the Referral Document YA 1.411 that comes from \nheadquarters.  The form has a box that reads: \"Medical: Communicable / Chronic Diseases / \nSuicidal / Handicap\", with a small area for data entry.  As discussed later in Section 4.2, the \ninclusion of \"Handicap\" here is inappropriate.  There should be a separate box for \"Disability\" \n(\"Handicap\" is not a commonly accepted term and offensive to some persons with disabilities), \nwith the most readily available information included, but certainly revisable by initial screeners. \nPage 30 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nAs  described  in  Section  4.2  regarding  medical  and  dental  services,  Section  4.3  regarding \ntreatment  and  mental  health  programs,  and  Section  4.6  regarding  educational  programs, \nscreenings and assessments continue at various times and intervals for each individual program.  \nI believe that one of the strengths of a number of programs is the CYA's goal to continuously \nassess the needs of its constituency.  Probably the major issue that I had with many assessments \nis that wards with disabilities are not continuously apprised of their rights under the ADA and \nother disability laws and regulations. \n \nPerhaps one of the best places to begin this process is during joint orientations with all wards.  A \nmodel for this already exists at SYCRCC/Norwalk.  At this institution, the Wards Rights Officer \nindependently  prepared  a  Microsoft  Power  Point presentation on a number of policies and \nprocedures for new wards.  This was an excellent effort that should be commended.  I recall that \nthe presentation had only a small portion dedicated to ADA and disability rights that covered \nsome basics, but it could also be expanded to inform new wards of their rights under the ADA \nand describe the CYA's programs under the ADA.  This presentation (with due credit to its \nauthor) could also be presented at ward orientations at the other two intake facilities and at other \nlocations as appropriate.  This topic is also discussed in Section 5.2. \n \n(b)  Psychological Testing \n \nPsychological testing at the initial screening includes various written and verbal components, \nincluding the Suicide Risk Screening Questionnaire (SRSQ) as part of the Suicide Prevention \nAssessment and Response (SPAR) program.  It is this form that usually triggers an incoming \nward's referral to the chief psychiatrist or staff psychologist, although some ward may be referred \nfor  various  other  reasons,  including  the  use  of  psychotropic  medications,  history  of  prior \npsychiatric hospitalization, or recent disturbed behavior (per TDO #03-18).  While the issue of \nsuicide is indeed a major issue that cannot be taken lightly, it appears that suicide risk or a \ndocumented history is the guiding force in further psychological evaluation.  Whether or not \nother  wards  (as  well  as  the  entire  institution)  could  benefit  from  an  initial  psychological \nassessment is unknown, but I would suggest that it is a process that should also occur, given the \npure statistics on the number of such wards discussed elsewhere in this report and in other expert \nreports.  The only reason this does not occur appears to be largely based on staffing resources.  It \nshould be noted that wards are sometimes referred for psychological analysis at other various \ntimes, whether by the treatment team, teachers, or other staff, so this does not represent the only \nopportunity for evaluation, although it would appear to be the best opportunity. \n \n(c)  Case Conferences \n \nI attended a number of case conferences with wards with disabilities, at which a ward's progress \nin all treatment areas is reviewed in detail with the ward at regular intervals (at least every 120 \nPage 31 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \ndays, and sometimes more frequently if changes to the ward's program occur).  I believe these \nare extremely important exercises that give wards a good sense of what is expected of them.   \n \nDue to the relative informality of the meeting, I got the sense that a ward's disability would be \naccommodated within the meeting parameters.  The conferences for wards with disabilities that I \nattended appeared to be appropriate in that the major issues were covered and the wards usually \nhad the opportunity to express their own personal needs, although the wards' specific disabilities \nwere rarely discussed.  The only exception was one case conference discussed further in Section \n4.8, in which the ward was never really allowed to be involved in the conference, in my opinion, \nlargely due to a hearing disability. \n \n(d)  Parole Board Hearings \n \nOf all the activities and meetings that I reviewed and attended, I was most impressed with the \nParole Board hearings.  I attended about 12 of these, both before the northern and southern \nBoards.  These Board members have a daunting task, and I feel that they properly put the safety \nof the public first when arriving at the difficult decisions they must make.  Beyond that, I felt \nthey were extremely fair and open-minded, and gave deserving wards every opportunity to \nsucceed, if they were willing to take the steps to do so. \n \nAt least seven of the hearings I attended involved wards with disabilities.  I saw no evidence of \nany improprieties in the Board's decision-making process with these wards.  In fact, the Board \nseemed concerned about each particular ward's disability and how the disability affected the \nprogress made while at the CYA, albeit at a somewhat informal level.   \n \nMy only concern with Board hearings is more procedural than practical.  At the beginning of \neach hearing, the supervising Board member would sometimes ask a ward if the ward had a \ndisability  that  would  prevent  the  ward  from  participating  fully  at  the  hearing.    This  is  a \nparaphrasing  of  the  actual  words  used,  which  varied  and  sometimes  did  not  use  the  most \nappropriate terminology.  I would recommend that a more formal written question to this effect \nbe prepared and read either by the Board member or the clerk prior to each meeting.  For \nexample, the question could read: \"Do you have any physical, mental, or other disability that \ncould prevent you from fully participating in and understanding all that is being said today at this \nmeeting, and if so, is there any accommodation that we can provide to assist you at the meeting?\" \nPage 32 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  During the initial ward interviews, advise wards of their rights under the ADA and Section \n504,  and  receive  formal  documentation  that  they  have  received  and  understood  this \ninformation. \n2.  During the initial ward interviews and screenings, ask and determine if alternative formats for \nwritten data, auxiliary aids, or other communication accommodations are needed either for \nthe interview itself or for subsequent screenings and assessments. \n3.  Provide appropriate accommodations as needed for wards with disabilities in the initial \nassessments and psychological testing. \n4.  Revise  the  Referral  Document,  YA  1.411,  to  include  an  area  to  describe  an  initial \ndetermination of \"Disability\", and remove the term \"Handicap\". \n5.  To  the  maximum  extent  feasible,  expand  the  number  of  wards  undergoing  initial \npsychological evaluation, not limiting these evaluations to just those wards who score high \non the SRSQ or are currently \"high risk\". \n6.  Expand the wards' orientation at the intake centers to include specific information about the \nADA, IDEA, and wards' with disabilities rights (see also Section 5.2). \n7.  Provide for an open exchange of ideas during case conferences, and specifically discuss a \nward's disability and how it is being accommodated at the CYA, as well as any lack of access \nto programs that the ward may encounter. \n8.  Prepare a written inquiry about a ward's potential inability to effectively take part in a Parole \nBoard hearing due to the ward's disability, to be formally read and answered by each ward at \nthe beginning of each hearing. \nPage 33 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.2  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards' with Disabilities Access to Medical/Dental Care \n \nAn extensive and detailed health care expert's report, dated August 22, 2003, was reviewed as \npart of my scope of work.  In the interest of brevity, I will not reiterate much of what is in that \nreport, except to say that my observations and findings were very similar.  Unfortunately, while I \nsaw consistent improvements in a number of other areas since all of the other experts' reports, I \ncould not document many specific improvements in the area of medical services and felt a \ngreater degree of defensiveness of the part of medical staff than with any other group.  This \nshould signal the need for additional ADA training for medical staff.  One marked exception to \nthis statement was the medical facility at El Paso de Robles YCF.  Perhaps a reason is that the \nnew medical treatment facility there has caused the staff to re-evaluate how its services are \ndelivered to wards, and as architects can attest, new, state-of-the-art facilities can dramatically \nchange perspectives and related services.  But under times of economic uncertainty, it must be \nrealized that programs must still function effectively with less than ideal physical facilities, as is \nthe case at most of the other institutions, and certainly improvements in health care delivery must \nbe taken seriously. \n \nWithin the context of programs for wards with disabilities, an important introductory distinction \nneeds to be made between medical care and disability.  It is true that some persons with \ndisabilities may have greater medical needs due to conditions associated with their disabilities.  \nFor example, a person with spinal cord injuries who may use a wheelchair needs to be concerned \nabout upper body movement and exercise, as well as monitoring blood pressure and circulation.  \nHowever, many persons with disabilities are very \"healthy\" and only need basic health care \nsupport  for  specific  issues  associated  with  their  disabilities.    This  distinction  is  important, \nbecause  often  within  the  institutional  context,  \"healthcare\"  and  \"disability\"  become  almost \nsynonymous.  This can negatively affect persons with disabilities in a number of ways: (1) \nstereotypes  about  medical  dependence  can  hamper  the  basic  right  and  practical  need  for \nindependent living, (2) sometimes persons with disabilities are relegated to the medical setting, a \nrestrictive  environment  that  may  be  inappropriate  and  unnecessary,  and  (3)  persons  with \ndisabilities are afforded additional protections under the law, and following medical policies \nalone may be inadequate to afford persons with disabilities equal rights. \n \nThe above distinction is made herein, because during my visits within the CYA, while I did not \ndocument any irrefutable instance where a ward with a disability was subject to discrimination \ndue to a misconception about the person's medical needs, it can be a problem that must be \naddressed.  I did receive some general feedback from senior staff that medical solutions may be \nappropriate when really the issue was a disability access issue, but future training will hopefully \nprovide additional insight into this perception. \n \nThere were also two instances (one at Ventura and one at Norwalk) where wards with physical \ndisabilities were detained in the medical outpatient housing unit (OHU).  I would not begin to \nPage 34 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nsecond-guess the medical diagnoses, and it is probable that such placement was warranted and \nappropriate, at least for a period of time.  However, there might have also been a possibility that \nthis physical placement was deemed necessary due to the lack of other appropriate physical \nlocations within the facility to house these wards.  (It should be noted that given the choice, most \nwards would possibly choose an outpatient living situation over other placements.  However, \nsuch a placement, if medically unwarranted, would still be improper since the ward could be \ndeprived of needed services as well as beneficial social intervention.) \n \nAnother issue raised during discussions with medical staff, and recommended by the health care \nexperts, was the possibility of additional outsourcing of various medical services (including \nophthalmology, pharmacy, etc.).  While I am in no position to agree or disagree with how the \nservices are rendered, I would raise some caution due to the fact that under Title II of the ADA, \ncontractors assume the same legal requirement for full program access as the public entity \ncontracting  for  the  services.    This  raises  a  range  of  issues,  such  as  contractual  clauses, \ndocumentation, and monitoring.  Traditionally, many smaller private companies are not prepared \nto accept and provide their services under these requirements, as Title III ADA obligations for \nprivate businesses are very different.  Therefore, if indeed medical services are outsourced, \nprocedures  should  be  established  to  assure  full  access  to  these  programs  for  wards  with \ndisabilities. \n \nBeyond the general discussions above, there are several other on-going conditions within the \ninstitutions  visited  that  exhibited  consistent  problems  on  a  system-wide  basis.    These  are \nitemized below: \n \n(1) There does not appear to be a suitable prioritization procedure for high profile medical issues.  \nSerious and long-term vision conditions are among the main problem areas, and these seriously \naffect wards with visual disabilities.  Two wards I interviewed had potentially serious problems \nwith optic nerve damage and/or macular degeneration that had not been treated effectively for \nsome time.  In addition, the health services experts' report documents two wards with serious eye \nproblems that could result in loss of vision (it is unknown but doubtful that these are the same \ncases).  These types of cases need to be given special handling, and procedures for identification \nand documentation of effective treatment need to be improved. \n \n(2) The CYA medical clinics do not appear to be taking adequate steps to provide the most \nappropriate  auxiliary  aids  (including  prosthetics)  to  wards  with  disabilities  under  their \njurisdiction.  On a number of occasions, parents of wards were asked to privately provide and \npay for such aids, and wards are provided with ineffective products by the medical clinics.  For \nexample, one ward at Norwalk was without the prescribed prosthetic limb, and the ward's father \nwas reportedly attempting to procure one.  Under Title II of the ADA, if a ward with a disability \nneeds any auxiliary aid to take part in a program, such as attending school or treatment programs, \nparticipate in recreational activities (even if they are adaptive physical education programs), or \nPage 35 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nwork in free venture programs (note that a ward could not legally be excluded because of a \nphysical disability), the most appropriate auxiliary aid must be provided. \n \n(3) The CYA Temporary Departmental Order #03-12 regarding the wards' vision examination \nprocess and the issuance of glasses poses numerous problems for wards with disabilities.  (A \nreview of Section 3.1 regarding the ADA's definition of persons with visual impairments should \nbe reviewed for additional background information.)  This policy is generally overseen and \nimplemented  by  the  medical  services  programs  at  each  facility,  although  the  three  intake \nfacilities at Norwalk, Ventura, and Preston initially implement the assessment and procurement \nof glasses, if allowed by the policy. \n \nFirst, the initial refraction test measures only distance vision and does not measure close reading.  \nA  distance  vision  of  20/50  is  deemed  to  be  acceptable  by  the  policy,  not  meriting  vision \ncorrection.  (The policy references DMV policies, but the DMV is only concerned about a person \nseeing well enough to drive safely, and is not particularly concerned if a person can read a book.  \nOne would assume that the CYA is concerned how a student can see to read schoolwork, a \nprogram it offers that DMV does not.)  If the CYA offers a program to wards, it must provide \nappropriate  auxiliary  aids  so  that  wards  with  disabilities  can  take  part  in  the  program  as \neffectively as all wards.  It should be noted that the educational services assessment team at \nPreston does administer close vision testing for wards; however, the purpose and outcome is \nunclear, since it is not known that wards who demonstrate a need for glasses for reading are \nactually provided with them as a result of this activity. \n \nSecond, the policy allows a limited number of glasses over various time periods, with limits on \nhow many refractions a ward may have.  This policy appears to be largely punitive in nature.  \nEven  if  glasses  were  broken  by  a  ward  due  to  misconduct  (a  rare  occurrence  from  my \nobservations), certainly even that would not allow the deprivation of an essential auxiliary aid \nnecessary for daily functioning.  One ward interviewed stated that he left his glasses in his locker \nwhen at the dormitory and did not take them in to his bunk to read or study at night, as other \nwards did, for fear of breaking them.  My own opinion, which will undoubtedly appear excessive \nto some, is that wards should be issued two pairs of glasses, and encouraged to use them.  The \nminor additional costs would far outweigh the greater potential costs for extra instructional time \nfor missed work, the inability to perform work tasks properly, and extra security costs for wards \nwho cannot see effectively. \n \nThis TDO needs to be updated with particular emphasis on a ward's with a disability rights under \nthe ADA and Section 504.  The policy tends to exacerbate or possibly even create a ward's \ndisability by not providing a reasonable degree of visual acuity. \n \n(4)  It is unknown what effect the use of mace has on wards with visual disabilities.  A number of \nwards who had documented vision problems complained that macings caused a marked decline \nPage 36 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nin their visual acuity.  It should be realized that this report is not intended to evaluate either \ngeneral correctional practices or medical diagnoses.  However, where a particular activity has the \npotential of negatively affecting wards with disabilities to a greater (and possibly debilitating) \nextent when compared to the affect on other wards, that must be a concern of this report.  I \nwould recommend that the CYA take steps to medically evaluate these affects and take the \nnecessary steps to implement alternative measures of restraint on these wards, when and if \nappropriate. \n \n(5)  For the purposes of this report, wards with diseases and conditions covered by the ADA are \nnot being advised of their rights and of the CYA's obligations under Title II of the ADA.  HIV \ntesting and protocols are out of date.  Counseling and treatment programs for many of the \ncovered conditions are non-existent. \n \nWith respect to the dental services provided to wards, it appeared that the programs were no less \neffective for wards with disabilities than for the general population, and there was no evidence \nthat wards with disabilities had less than equal access to these services. \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Train medical staff to recognize the nature of disability issues and independent living goals, \nas well as protections afforded to patients with disabilities under the ADA. \n2.  Prepare an \"action plan\" for wards with mobility impairments to integrate with the general \npopulation as soon as medical issues are resolved, including determining the most physically \naccessible locations available and making the barrier removal improvements required on a \ntimely basis. \n3.  If  any  medical  or  pharmaceutical  services  are  to  be  outsourced,  institute  training  and \nmonitoring  for  the  private  service  providers  to  assure  compliance  with  ADA  Title  II \nrequirements. \n4.  Review and improve procedures for the identification and documentation of treatment for \ncases involving wards with disabilities who have serious, and potentially worsening, medical \nconditions. \n5. Review  and  improve  procedures  for  selecting  and  procuring  the  most  appropriate  and \n   \neffective auxiliary aid, such as prosthetics, required for participation in programs due to a \ndisability or medical condition, , and provide these at no expense to the ward or family. \n6.  Revise Temporary Departmental Order #03-12 to provide for the evaluation of close vision \nnecessary for reading and completing schoolwork or other required written activities and to \nprocure suitable glasses, contact lenses, or other aids for the ward's constant use, if needed. \n7.  Provide a medically appropriate evaluation of the effect of mace on wards with visual \nimpairments and take the necessary steps to implement alternative measures of restraint on \nthese wards, when and if appropriate. \n8.  Advise wards with medical conditions or diseases of their rights and of the CYA's obligations \nunder Title II of the ADA. \nPage 37 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.3  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards' with Disabilities Access to Treatment Programs \n \nThe CYA operates under the premise that all wards have the right to appropriate treatment \nnecessary  to  assist  wards  in  returning  to  a  productive  life  after  their  commitment  time  is \ncompleted.  I was consistently impressed that staff members exhibited a strong commitment to \nthis objective.  It was clear that staff were predominately interested in the rehabilitation of the \nwards and not in a punitive approach to their confinement. \n \nTreatment programs were varied and often extensive.  These programs include various degrees \nof mental health treatment and counseling programs, sex offender treatment programs, substance \nabuse treatment programs, and other treatment programs, as described in more detail below. \n \n(a)  General Mental Health Treatment Programs \n \nI was provided with two previous authoritative mental health reports regarding programs for \nwards who have mental health issues (Stanford/Steiner Report, 1990, and Mental Health Experts \nDrs. Trupin and Patterson Report, 2003).  As described in Section 3.1, federal and state disability \nregulations would classify the vast majority, if not all, of these wards as \"qualified persons with a \ndisability\" under both Section 504 and the ADA, as well as an \"individuals with special needs\" \nunder the IDEA.  (Again, determination of a disability is dependent upon the individual, not the \ndisability category.)  Since these previous reports are extensive and have already been considered \nby the CYA in its ongoing remedial plans, it is not my intent to cover much of the same ground, \nsince in general, I am in a basic agreement with much of the content of these reports.  Rather, \nthis section is intended to focus on the following:  \n(1) a review and evaluation of general mental heath issues from a disability perspective (i.e., \nhow the applicable disability regulations require equal treatment of wards with mental \ndisabilities) as opposed to a clinical perspective, \n(2) a review and evaluation of those few areas where either polices have changed since the \nprevious reports, or new procedures or information have been encountered,  \n(3) a review and evaluation of a few areas not covered in the previous reports, and \n(4) a review and evaluation of those few issues where I am not in full agreement with the \nfindings or recommendations of the previous reports. \n \nPsychiatrists and Psychologists \n \nI interviewed and reviewed the work of at least one, and in some cases as many as four, \npsychologists at each institution I visited.  I interviewed only one psychiatrist, since usually there \nwere no psychiatrists available during my site visits, as most work part-time.  My general \nimpression regarding psychologists is similar to that of the teachers that are discussed later.  \nThey are extremely dedicated and committed to treating the wards, and utilize exceptional skills \nin dealing with the extent of the daily problems they encounter with wards.  The only real \nPage 38 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nproblem regarding psychologists, again like the teachers, is that there are just not enough of \nthem.  CYA psychologists currently carry caseloads that are double to triple those of their \ncounterparts in private practice or appropriately funded institutions.  They all have their own \ntechniques for dealing with the \"onslaught\", and given the limited resources they have, I would \nnot question their individual approaches to their work.  While the mental health experts' report \ncites a lack of a consistent approach as being a problem, a generalized situation with which I \nwould probably agree, the reality is that when appropriate and consistent standards for the CYA \nare constructed, they will have to be based on accepted standards for allowable caseload.  Unless \nsubstantially more mental health professionals are provided, the results will be far less than \noptimal.  Most of the problematic issues described below are directly attributable to the lack of \nappropriate mental health staffing, and resolutions of these problems will not be realistic until \nstaffing levels are increased or re-allocations of these resources are made. \n \nTreatment Planning \n \nThe mental health experts' report deals with the issue of comprehensive treatment planning and \nstates that effective planning was not evident at the time of the report.  It is possible that the \ncurrent Special Program Assessment Needs (SPAN) was not fully implemented at the time of \ntheir report, but is now in use at all three intake facilities (Norwalk, Preston, and Ventura, \nalthough of the three, Ventura's implementation appears to be more consistent).  The assessment \nappears to be basically a good one.  For the purposes of this report, the main drawback to the \nprocedures and forms utilized in the SPAN process is that there is not a specific identification of \ndisability, as defined under the ADA or Section 504.  As discussed in other sections, while it is \nnot appropriate to view how a disability is treated without focusing on the individual with the \ndisability, there is nothing wrong, and it can certainly be advantageous, to clarify an individual's \ndisability at this point of assessment.  This is as advantageous for treatment purposes as it is for \ncase management purposes, particularly with the newly implemented ADA Coordinator process - \nit is important for all staff to know that the ward in question has certain rights under the ADA \nand Section 504. \n \nIt also appears, as hinted at but not specifically stated in the mental health experts' report, that \ntreatment  options at this early planning stage are limited.  Often, it appears that available \nprograms take precedence over the specific needs of the individual.  This is not to imply that \nwhole new programs need to be developed for each individual ward with a mental disability.  \nHowever, typical interventions must be modified as necessary. \n \nCase Management and Conferences \n \nThe mental health experts' report found that case management standards were inconsistent.  It \nappeared to me, based upon my attendance in case conferences and review of those records, that \nthere  have  been  some  improvements  in  this  area.    However,  while  consistency  of  case \nPage 39 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nmanagement  is  desirable  from  an  administrative  and  possibly  even  a  clinical  standpoint, \nindividual treatment for a ward with a disability can get lost.  I sat in on a number of case \nmanagement conferences with wards with disabilities and found that treatment and other issues \nspecifically related to the ward's disability were not usually included in the assessment.  While it \nwould be potentially discriminatory to hold a management conference because of a ward's \ndisability  (when  wards  without  disabilities  did  not  have  such  conferences),  it  is  certainly \nacceptable and advisable to focus a part of the case management conference on how a ward's \nindividual disability is being accommodated in the treatment programs.  At these conferences, a \nward's disability was almost consistently avoided as an almost \"taboo\" subject, perhaps under a \nfear that discussion of it would somehow be improper.  For example, one case conference with a \nward who was severely hard of hearing never mentioned the subject to ascertain if services were \nbeing provided in a manner that the ward could easily access. \n \nPsychotropic Medications \n \nThe  use  of  various  medications,  including  psychotropic,  was  potentially  one  of  the  most \nproblematic of all mental health procedures that I reviewed.  I agree with the mental health \nexperts' report that standards for the review and usage of medications is cursory at best.  But \nwhile that report and the CYA's approach takes a clinical approach of using medication to treat \ntarget symptoms, the overall effects on the individual is neglected.  Measurement of the effect to \nthe individual, as well as the target symptoms, is lacking.  While the formalities of consenting \npractices appeared to be acceptable, it was not clear that wards really understood the overall \neffects of their medication.  The majority of interviewed wards who were taking psychotropic \nmedications did not seem to know why they were taking them.  Wards also complained of a \nnumber of side effects, including sleepiness, general malaise, inability to concentrate, and in \nother cases, extreme agitation, most of which they felt (correctly or incorrectly) were directly \nattributable to their medication. \n \nIt was unclear that psychiatrists or psychologists had any serious concerns on growing universal \nconcerns about the potential overuse and negative side effects of Selective Seratonin Reuptake \nInhibitors or SSRI's (including increased agitation and at worst, suicidal tendencies, as well as  \nsevere withdrawal symptoms) for the treatment of moderate anxiety and/or depression for wards \nunder the age of 20.  Perhaps this concern is more pronounced in the context of my report, since \nwards with disabilities may be more often subjected to misdiagnoses because of manifestations \nof their disability.  I would recommend that these prescriptions be re-evaluated and closely \nmonitored on an on-going basis to assure that such medications meet the needs of the individual \nand are not used primarily for behavior or mood control. \n \nPage 40 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nSuicide Prevention \n \nIt is unclear if the current suicide prevention (SPAR) process was in effect at the time of the \nmental health experts' report.  The diagnostic process and forms appeared reasonable, but I \nwould not venture an opinion on the effectiveness of the procedures on such limited and short-\nterm observation.  The mental health experts' report (and other referenced sources) recommended \nnot isolating youths with suicidal tendencies, but that technique appeared to be the normal \nintervention method at the time of my visits.  The previously identified problems of overuse of \nSPAR's and chemical restraints, as well as the lack of alternatives such as verbal de-escalation, \nare  of  additional  concern  within  the  context  of  this  report,  since  these  problems  tend  to \ndisproportionately affect wards with mental disabilities. \n \n(b)  Sex Offender Treatment Programs \n \nCertainly many wards in sexual offender programs are also wards with disabilities, but as \ndiscussed in Section 3.1, applicable regulations and practices would not define the commission \nof a sexual offenses in the broadest context as a disability.  It should be noted that several written \npsychological evaluations I reviewed contained the designation \"Sexual Offender\" after the \nheading \"Disability:\", which I would characterize as a mis-categorization, unless one could draw \na direct parallel to a particular mental or physical impairment that would cause the behavior.  \nHowever, one interesting question is whether such a designation, even if inappropriate, would \nmeet the criteria for one \"being regarding as an individual with a disability.\"  My own opinion is \nthat it could, but I also feel the better overall approach would be to provide additional guidance \nand training so that such designations can be more appropriate in the future. \n \nI reviewed these programs in general, particularly within the context of wards with disabilities, \nbut did not feel it appropriate or necessary to evaluate the details of each program.  The programs \nappeared to be well organized and thoughtful, although I certainly could not evaluate their \noverall effectiveness.  It is unfortunate that the \"waiting list\" for these programs is too long, \nagain evidencing that more resources and funding are drastically needed.  What was most \nimportant to my scope of inquiry was that the programs appeared to integrate wards with \ndisabilities at an appropriate level, and I could find no evidence that any ward was denied access \nto these programs solely on the basis of their disability.  In fact, many wards with physical \ndisabilities that I interviewed (almost 30%) had either been or were currently in one of these \nprograms. \n \n(c)  Drug/Alcohol Treatment Programs \n \nSubstance abuse may or may not be a determining factor in deciding if an individual has a \ndisability, as discussed in Section 3.1.  That discussion will not be repeated here, but suffice it to \nsay that many wards in substance abuse programs are also wards with disabilities, either directly \nbecause of past substance abuse, of mis-characterization, or unrelated impairments. \nPage 41 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nI reviewed these programs in general, particularly within the context of wards with disabilities, \nbut did not evaluate the details of every program.  The programs appeared to be comprehensive, \nalthough I could not evaluate their overall effectiveness. Again, more resources and funding are \ndrastically needed, since there are more applicable wards than program vacancies (it has been \nestimated by others that as many as 85% of all wards have substance abuse issues).  What was \nimportant to my scope of inquiry was that the programs also integrated wards with disabilities at \nan appropriate level, and I could find no evidence that any ward was denied access to these \nprograms solely on the basis of their disability.  A number of wards I interviewed, with physical \nand mental disabilities, had either been or were currently in one of these programs. \n \n(d)  Intensive Treatment Programs (ITP) \n(e)  Special Counseling Programs (SCP) \n(f)  Special Management Programs (SMP) \n \nI realize and am somewhat apologetic for the fact that evaluating these programs together is not \nfully appropriate and possibly does a disservice to the different approaches and techniques used \nto serve wards with the most serious range of both behavioral issues and mental disabilities.  \nHowever,  my  evaluations  of  these  programs  are  so  similar  that  in  the  interest  of  lack  of \nrepetition, I am doing so. \n \nThe ITP's serve wards with the most critical behavioral concerns and mental disabilities, while \nthe others programs serve less crucial needs.  I interviewed a number of wards in these restrictive \nprograms and reviewed the complete files of these and other wards.  In some cases, it is apparent \nthat such placements are warranted, as these wards either pose a real danger to either themselves \nor others or require an intensive degree of intervention on many levels.  In other cases, the \nrationale for inclusion in these programs is less clear.  There are certainly histories involved with \neach ward that transcend the written documentation or the limited contact that I was able to have \nwith each program and individual wards.  I would only raise a significant degree of caution to the \nCYA that criteria for inclusion in these programs should be reviewed in a detailed manner to \nassure that wards are not placed in these programs inappropriately. \n \nFor the purpose of this inquiry, I would stress caution, where wards with disabilities are placed in \nthese programs, to assure that placement is not based either directly or indirectly on a ward's \nphysical or mental disability, or upon manifestations of that disability.  Two of the wards I \ninterviewed who were in these restricted programs had physical disabilities, and it was unclear to \nme that such a placement would have been warranted, based on the limited information I had, if \nthe disability had not been present.  The CYA should make sure that wards with physical \ndisabilities are not placed in these programs out of convenience or because accommodations are \neasier to provide in these settings.  For wards with mental and emotional disabilities, it was much \nmore  difficult  to  gain  specific  information  about  specific  wards  and  the  extent  of  their \nPage 42 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \ndisabilities, but the same assurances should be included to make sure that wards with these \ndisabilities are not placed in restrictive programs because of manifestations of their disabilities. \n \nIn this context, I have concerns about some items included in the August, 2003, Draft of the \n\"Youthful Offenders with Disabilities\" policy.  (It should be noted that I have not specifically \nevaluated or relied upon information contained in this document in my evaluations, since it is \nlabeled \"Draft\", and to my knowledge, has not been disseminated as policy to staff.  However, at \nsome level, I feel the material could represent the current thinking of the CYA with respect to \nthese issues.)  In \"General Levels of Care\", under \"Specialized Counseling Program: Mental or \nPhysical Impairments Level of Care: The youthful offender (a) exhibits either acute or long-term \nmanifestation of mental or physical disorders at a level greater than what can be reasonably \naddressed  within  general  population,  (b)  (omitted  for  brevity),  (c)  may  be  vulnerable  to \nvictimization by more sophisticated youthful offenders.\"  These characterizations are discussed \nin Sections 3.1 and 3.2, but in general, it is unclear why manifestations of a disability could and \nshould not be addressed in less restrictive settings and what would constitute \"reasonably\", as \nwell as what degree of \"protection\" a person with a disability requires.  I have similar concerns \nover some of the items included in the \"Intensive Treatment Program Level of Care\" and the \n\"Intermediate Inpatient Level of Care\".  The entire section entitled \"Impairments Classified and \nPlacement Designated\" should also be reviewed within the context of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this \nreport.  Again the ADA requires evaluation of an individual with a disability, not evaluation of \nan isolated impairment.  The CYA should establish polices to assure that wards with disabilities \nare placed based upon the needs of the individual and that the individual actually requires \nrestrictive placement. \n \nOf all of these programs visited, the Sequoia Specialized Behavioral Treatment Program at \nPreston YCF stands out as an innovative approach to treating wards with severe behavior and \nviolence problems.  While the results are inconclusive as to the overall effectiveness of this \nprogram, such approaches should be strengthened and resources re-allocated to support similar \nrestrictive programs at other sites.  For example, such an approach could be effective for wards \nwith serious developmental disabilities (those traditionally labeled as mentally retarded or with \nlow IQ), as the current trend toward relegating such wards to more restrictive programs is clearly \ninappropriate and ineffective, and a new treatment model is needed. \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Evaluate how resources can be increased or re-allocated to increase the number of qualified \npsychiatrists and psychologists in nearly all treatment programs. \n2.  Focus a part of all case management conferences on how a ward's individual disability is \nbeing accommodated in the treatment programs. \n3.  Make sure that wards understand the rationale and side effects of prescribed psychotropic \nmedications. \nPage 43 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.  Evaluate and closely monitor the use of psychotropic medications, particularly SSRI's, for \nwards under the age of 20 on an on-going basis to assure that such medications meet the \nneeds of the individual and are not used primarily for behavior or mood control. \n5.  Evaluate the potential overuse of SPAR's and chemical restraints, as well as the lack of \nalternatives such as verbal de-escalation, when dealing with wards with disabilities who may \npresent suicidal tendencies. \n6.  When determining disability eligibility for wards who have been sex offenders or who have a \nsubstance abuse history, evaluate the individual ward's condition, as described in Section 3.1. \n7.  Establish policies to assure that placement of wards with disabilities into restrictive programs \nis not based either directly or indirectly on a ward's physical or mental disability, or upon \nmanifestations of that disability. \n8.  Establish polices to assure that wards with disabilities are placed in restrictive programs based \nupon  the  needs  of  the  individual  and  that  the  individual  actually  requires  restrictive \nplacement. \n9.  Encourage new treatment approaches, such as the Sequoia Specialized Behavioral Treatment \nProgram at Preston YCF, to serve wards with severe behavior and violence problems, as well \nas those with serious developmental disabilities. \nPage 44 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.4  Specific Area of Inquiry- Wards' with Disabilities Access to Disciplinary System \n(DDMS) \n \nThe CYA handles ward discipline through the Disciplinary Decision Making System (DDMS).  \nThis provides a graduated system of ward discipline that incorporates statutory and constitutional \nmandates and provides essential due process guarantees to ensure fairness and equal application. \n \nLevel 1 is for minor misconduct that disrupts ward programs or institutional operations, and this \nlevel allows staff the discretion to respond to ward misconduct at the lowest level.  The Level 2 \nprocess  is  for  medium  to  intermediate  misconduct;  Level  2  dispositions  cannot  include \nextensions  to  a  ward's  projected  Parole  Board  date.  The  Level  3  process  is  for  serious \nmisconduct that adversely affects the operation, safety, or security of the institution.  A sustained \nLevel 3 violation may result in an extension to a ward's projected Parole Board date. \n \nThe basic DDMS process is standardized throughout the CYA, although some details are applied \nsomewhat differently at individual institutions.  The process is monitored via the computerized \ntracking system.  Each institution has a DDMS Coordinator, often the program administrator or a \ntreatment team supervisor.  The initial disciplinary action report may be instituted by any staff \nmember, but most often comes from a youth correctional officer at the living unit where a \nparticular word is housed.  The DDMS Coordinator or an authorized representative undertakes a \nprocess of fact finding, beginning with informal fact finding hearing with the ward.  The word \n\"informal\"  is  used  because  there  are  no  other  persons  typically  present  at  the  fact-finding \nhearing, although details of the hearing and the fact finder's decision are put into writing and \nmade a part of the permanent record.  The ward has the opportunity to appeal the findings of the \nDDMS Coordinator by appealing to the Superintendent of the institution and to an independent \nmediator if necessary. \n \nYouth correctional officers and other staff member should be trained and monitored on a regular \nbasis to assure that a particular action or behavior potentially considered as a disciplinary issue \nfor  a  ward  with  a  disability  is  not  mis-categorized as such.  For  example, a ward with a \ncommunication disability may not hear particular instructions, or may not fully understand what \nthey are supposed to do.  This type of action can mistakenly be written up as a disciplinary action \nbecause of the ward's or the officer's inability to communicate effectively.  Likewise, the ward \nmay  he  engaged  in  a  certain  activity  purely  as  a  manifestation  of  the  specific  disability, \nparticularly those wards with emotional disabilities, and some correctional officers may relate \nthe behavior to disciplinary problems.  This is the ongoing concern that was also discussed in the \nmental health experts' report, and those who deal with these wards on a daily basis need to be \ntraining to identify disability-related behaviors from actions requiring disciplinary referral.  It \nmust be acknowledged that sometimes the distinction between the two is a gray area.  However, \nwards with disabilities need to the assured that those behaviors that are casual manifestation of \nthe disability, for example, uncontrollable language, inability to concentrate on instructions \nPage 45 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \ngiven, and similar manifestations, are not evaluated and disciplined purely because the disability. \nDuring my interviews with wards with disabilities, particularly those who were deaf or hard of \nhearing, several wards relayed a number of instances where their inability to communicate \neffectively appeared to be a proximate cause of the event and the resulting disciplinary action.  \nCertainly, the possibility exists that some of these could be biased and self-serving accounts of \nthe events, but it is likely that some of them have validity.  Perhaps the best way to monitor these \ncircumstances is for the newly appointed facility ADA Coordinators and potentially, on random \noccasions, the agency-wide programmatic ADA Coordinator to review selected DDMS cases \ninvolving wards with known disabilities to assure equal treatment. \n \nI sat in on a number of fact-finding hearings during my site visits to the various institutions, and I \nfelt that fact-finders were fair and attempted to go about their duties in an impartial manner.  I \nbelieve that some of the wards had disabilities, and I felt that's that the ward's disability did not \nnegatively impact the fairness and impartiality of the hearing.  Of course, since this is an \nindividual procedure, the possibility does exist that an individual fact-finding coordinator either \nmight not recognize an individual ward's disability and take that into the appropriate account if \nnecessary, or might potentially discriminate against a ward with the disability by misconceptions \nabout that ward's behavior or other issues.  However, since the ward has a right to appeal, I feel \nthe likelihood of such improper activity is remote, and for matters of expediency, agree that the \ncurrent process is acceptable.  My observations and interviews with DDMS Coordinators also \nconfirmed that wards with disabilities were generally accommodated for any communication \nneeds that might be necessary. \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Provide additional training on the ADA and Section 504 to DDMS Coordinators and other \nfact finding staff so that they can better identify those wards with disabilities in the fact-\nfinding hearings, and so that there is no unintentional discrimination against the ward in the \nfact-finding process due to the ward's disability. \n2.  Once a ward's disability is identified during the DDMS fact-finding process, the ward should \nbe advised of the rights afforded to the ward under the ADA and Section 504. \n3.  Include in the list of duties for the facility ADA Coordinators and potentially the agency-wide \nprogrammatic  ADA  Coordinator  to  review  selected  DDMS  cases  involving  wards  with \nknown disabilities to assure equal treatment. \n \nPage 46 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.5  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards' with Disabilities Access to the Wards' Rights Process \n \nWards rights and grievance procedures within the CYA generally involve a formalized system of \ncomputerized grievance forms and the review of those forms by selected staff.  The system is \nstandardized among all institutions; however, variations occur from facility to facility.  Each \nindividual living unit typically has a ward grievance clerk.  This ward's main task is to distribute \nand collect grievance forms from other wards.  The ward grievance clerks are generally selected \nfrom among those at the highest level of acceptable behavior and independence at each living \nunit.  The clerks are provided with a number complaint forms that must be accounted for at all \ntimes; the grievance forms cannot be destroyed or unused, as each has its place within the \ncomputerized tracking system.  Once a ward fills out a grievance form, it is given back to the \nward grievance clerk who forwards it either to the senior correctional officer on the unit or \ndirectly to the institution's Grievance Coordinator.  There are some exceptions to this, such as \nward grievances against that staff; these are usually given back to the senior correctional officer \nat the housing unit, although at some institutions they are sent directly by the wards to the \nSuperintendent. \n \nAs described in the ward grievance policy in Form YA 8.451, the ward grievance clerk may \ndiscuss the grievance with the ward before the form is accepted.  This could be problematic, in \nthat ward grievance clerks may use their own personal judgment or other subjective ideas they \nmay have in an effort to influence or dissuade a ward from submitting the grievance.  While \nthere is no definitive evidence that this is a rampant problem, there was some indication that this \nmight be occurring at some level. \n \nThe Ward Grievance Form YA 8.450 appears to be a reasonably good form, with one possible \nexception.  There is no place on the form to distinguish whether a particular grievance is based \nupon or is the result of a particular ward's disability.  There are some overall basic issues \nregarding grievances as these procedures are required and described under the ADA and Section \n504.  Whether or not the grievance procedures required by ADA and Section 504 are required to \nbe separate from the other grievance procedures is and has been an unresolved issue ever since \nthe advent of the ADA.  While the ADA may not specifically require that disability grievances \nbe separated, there are indications that such is preferable under ADA regulations.  Furthermore, \nanecdotal  and  procedural  evidence  from  a  wide  variety  of  public  entities  indicates  that  a \ndisability grievance procedure is difficult to implement and monitor unless it is indeed a separate \nprocess.    Usually,  for  most  public  agencies,  I  feel  that  a  separate  grievance  procedure  is \nwarranted.  However, in this instance, since such a formalized grievance procedure is already in \nplace  and  wards  are  familiar  with  it,  I  feel  it  could  be  acceptable  to  modify  the  current \nprocedures  by  including  disability-related  information  and  reviewing  such  complaints  in  a \nsomewhat different way. \n \nThere  are  two  additional  issues  regarding  the  current  grievance  process.    First,  the  ward \nPage 47 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \ngrievance clerks have not been given ADA training to understand the types of grievances that are \nallowed by the ADA, and such training is needed since the ward grievance clerks are actively \ninvolved  in  grievance  process.    The  facility  ADA  Coordinator  should  be  responsible  for \nconducting basic ADA training for this purpose, either as any new ward grievance clerk is \nappointed, or for all clerks at least once a year.  Furthermore, it does not appear that facility \nGrievance  Coordinators  have  been  training  specifically  with  the  ADA-required  grievance \nprocess; and this training is absolutely needed.  Second, the facility ADA Coordinator is not \ncurrently involved at all in the grievance process.  The ADA is clear that if a grievance is related \nto a disability, the ADA coordinator should monitor and ideally be involved in the initial \ndetermination of whether or not the grievance is accurate.  Because of these reasons, I would \nrecommend the following procedures being implemented, either as part of the current grievance \nprocedure, or as a separate process, to assure that wards with disabilities have open access to the \ngrievance process, as required by the ADA. \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Those ward grievance clerks and facility grievance coordinators involved in the distribution \nand collection of grievance forms should be trained in basic ADA grievance policy. \n2.  The grievance forms should be amended to include a section of questions that specifically ask \nif the ward feels that the grievance is based upon circumstances related to a disability, and if \nthe ward is filing the grievance under the requirements of the ADA or Section 504. \n3.  All  completed  grievances  for  which  the  ADA  and  disability  are  listed  as  an  issue  or \ncontributing  circumstance  should  go  directly  to  the  facility  ADA  Coordinator  at  each \ninstitution for consultation, or more appropriately, for resolution. \n4.  Completed grievance forms should be randomly monitored by the facility ADA Coordinator \nto determine if indeed disability is an issue, even though it may not have been specifically \ncited side by the ward filing the grievance. \n5.  All grievances involving or against that any staff member should be submitted directly to the \nSuperintendent and reviewed in a confidential manner, and not submitted through any other \nparty, similar to the staff grievance procedure at SYCRCC/Norwalk. \n6.  All grievances should be reviewed by someone who is not a party to the grievance.  For \nexample, if a grievance alleges problems with a medical procedure, that grievance should not \nbe forwarded to and reviewed by the medical services team, or anyone involved in the \nmedical programs, although certainly, the medical services team should be contacted as part \nof the fact finding process. \nPage 48 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.6  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards' with Disabilities Access to Education \n \nOne of the CYA's strongest assets lies in the expertise, effectiveness, and dedication of the \nteachers and administrators involved in the educational programs at all eight institutions visited.  \nI was consistently impressed with the teaching methods, lesson plans, and overall objectives of \nthe vast majority of teachers who were interviewed and whose classrooms were visited.  The \nmajor problem involved with teachers is that there are just not enough of them, and educational \nstaffing levels at all institutions are below what they should be, with some institutions being \ndrastically below acceptable norms.  Substitute teachers are almost non-existent, and retention of \ncredentialed teachers is becoming a greater problem, as many are leaving for higher paying jobs \nin the public school systems. \n \nThe educational experts' report deals with a number of issues relating to the general education \nprograms at all institutions.  Again, it should be noted these programs also greatly affect wards \nwith disabilities since over 80% of special education students are included in at least one regular \neducation class.  In the interest of brevity and conciseness, I will not reiterate many of the issues \nand recommendations included in that report, as I am in agreement with the vast majority of \nthem. \n \nAt the outset, it should be emphasized that there are a number of strong points in educational \nprograms for wards with disabilities that need to be stressed and continued.  The management of \na wide variety of educational plans (including individualized education plans, or IEP's) required \nby students with a range of abilities and needs is a significant task, and the CYA appears to be \ndoing a good job in organizing these educational activities.  Curriculum guides, both those \nprepared on an agency-wide and individual teacher level, are well-prepared and appear to be \ngenerally effective.  Special day class teachers and resource specialists appear to be adept at \nmodifying curricula to meet the variety of needs of special education students.  Generalized \nprocedures appear to be in compliance with local and state regulations and standards and appear \nto be comprehensive and, in most cases, effective.  Case conferences appear to give the proper \nweight on educational goals, in concert with other (and sometimes more crucial) behavioral and \npsychological goals. \n \nOn the problematic side, the occurrence of classes not being held is a major cause of concern.  \nSince I visited specific institutional high schools usually only on one or possibly two isolated \ndays, it would be impossible to translate my own observations into defensible statistics.  It was \nquite common, however, for at least some, or in some cases all, of the scheduled classes to be \nsuspended.  Statistics gleaned from various sources, and backed up by my own observations and \nthe educational experts' report, indicate that about 15% to 25% of scheduled classes do not meet.  \nReasons are complex and varied, but generally include the following: classroom or facility-wide \nviolence  and  security  concerns,  teacher  absences,  lack  of  substitute  teachers,  inflexible \nscheduling, and other causes.  It should be noted that a lack of continuity in classroom activities \nPage 49 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nis a more critical problem for many wards with disabilities and special education students, since \nconsistency  and  focused  activity,  as  well  as  the  psychological  need  of  expectation,  are  an \nimportant  prerequisite  for  students  with  learning  disabilities,  anxiety  disorders,  and  other \nconditions. \n \nThe institution exhibiting the most problems with cancelled classes and teacher absenteeism \nappears to be O. H. Close YCF, although N.A. Chaderjian YCF, Ventura YCF, and El Paso de \nRobles YCF are not far behind.  Problems at Close and Ventura have the greatest negative effect, \nsince these institutions service the younger age populations (13 to 18) during the most formative \nyears of the educational services offered.  Consistency at SYCRCC/Norwalk is also critical \nbecause of the transitory nature of the facility, and lack of consistent educational programs can \nstart incoming wards on a negative path with respect to their educational goals. \n \nWard attendance is also a growing cause of concern.  Up to 30% of wards in regular and special \neducation programs are absent each day.  On the positive side, the overcrowded conditions \ndiscussed in the educational experts' report were not found to be a major factor during our site \nvisits.  However, the reason may be that there has been a shift from a policy of attempting to \nhave all students attend to a policy of keeping more potentially disruptive students away from \nclasses.  A focus on other daytime activities, such as group therapy, Board-mandated activities, \nand special programs like the \"Feast\" program at Preston YCF, is definitely a factor, and these \nactivities should, to the maximum extent possible, be scheduled at times other than during the \nschool day, or an extended school day should be offered.  On the whole, it appears that the main \nreason for attendance problems revolves around real or perceived violence and gang activity by \nwards, an overall topic that is beyond the scope of this evaluation.  One recommendation made \nby the educational experts' report with which I am not in agreement is that wards receive \ndisciplinary consequences for not attending school.  Certainly, wards (particularly those under \n18) must be made aware that school attendance is required.  However, such a policy would have \na greater and disproportionate negative effect on wards with disabilities, particularly those with \nanxiety disorders and learning disabilities.  Until such time as special programs necessary to deal \nwith these disabilities are fully and effectively implemented, and until such time as wards can be \nguaranteed that they will not be the object of violent activity during school activities, such a \npolicy would, in my opinion, be discriminatory in nature and from a practical standpoint, less \neffective that a system of positive reinforcement. \n \nListed below are specific issues related to various sub-programs, as identified in the original \nscope of work, and as subsequently discovered. \n \n(a)  Special Education \n \nApproximately 25% of all wards within the CYA are registered with Special Education and have \nindividualized education plans (IEP's).  This basic statistic also includes wards above the age of \nPage 50 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n22, meaning that for the age group predominately covered by the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA), the percentage would be even higher.  (It should be noted that some adult \nwards over the age of 22 are still included in Special Education programs for various reasons.)  \nThe approximate percentages by institution are as follows: \nO. H. Close YCF: 32%     SYCRCC/Norwalk: 33% (permanent only) \nN. A. Chaderjian YCF: 28%    Heman G. Stark YCF: 15% \nDeWitt Nelson YCF: 30%    El Paso de Robles YCF: 33% \nVentura YCF: 25%      Preston YCF: 28% \nAll institutions: 23% \n \nAs indicated in Section 4.1, Screening and Assessment, the vast majority of wards with IEP's \ncome into the CYA with an active IEP from their previous school district.  The CYA has a rigid \npolicy of not accepting a ward with an IEP unless a copy of the IEP is with them upon entrance.  \nIt appears that the CYA does a good job of enforcing this policy, and I am in agreement that such \nenforcement  should  be  continued,  within  reason,  since  having  a  ward's  IEP  at  the  initial \nassessment is crucial to effective placement.  The potential negative aspect of such a policy is \nthat an incoming ward with a disability might be denied timely admission to the CYA solely \nbecause of errors of others (where those wards without IEP's would not be subject to such a \npolicy) and thus subject to unintentional discrimination.  What happens to a ward that is denied \nacceptance (e.g., whether the ward is sent back to County juvenile hall and thus also denied \nservices others receive) is beyond the scope of this report.  Therefore, I would recommend that \nthe CYA continue the current policy but also investigate alternative ways to resolve issues of \ninadequate IEP records with the Counties. \n \nAs discussed in Section 4.1, initial screening and testing given at the three intake facilities \n(SYCRCC, Preston, and Ventura) include a battery of tests intended to gauge a variety of \npotential problems and issues, both general and educational.  While these do not specifically \npinpoint special education needs, it appears that the identification of such needs is usually a by-\nproduct of the tests and referrals are usually made, if warranted. \n \nIt is also at this point that wards are advised of their rights under IDEA.  Each of the three intake \nfacilities use the standard form YA 7.432 (1/90), \"Special Education Rights Verification\", in \nconjunction with \"My Special Education Rights\".  (It should be noted that it appears that this \nform has not been updated in about 15 years, and not since IDEA 97 came into effect.)  I was not \nable to sit in on any intake sessions where these forms were described to incoming wards.  \nHowever, the forms are somewhat cursory and do not themselves convey all of the necessary \ninformation incoming wards should have about potential positive aspects of special education.  \nWards may have misconceptions about the process and may not be aware of the programs that \nspecial education offers.  Therefore, I would recommend that an additional orientation about \nspecial education be provided, either at the general educational intake level, or at the ADA \norientation level as described in Section 4.1, or both. \nPage 51 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nIn general, the CYA appears to be attuned to the legal and procedural requirements of holding \nIEP meetings and preparing IEP's for wards enrolled in special education.  As discussed in the \neducational experts' report and in the CDE Initial Verification Review Report, some procedural \ninconsistencies and irregularities were documented with respect to the timing of both initial and \nregular IEP meetings, particularly for those wards placed into restrictive programs, and while \nthese were also observed by me, they will not be repeated herein.  However, it appeared that \nimprovements have been made, and in general, I found no additional pattern of neglect or abuse \nin holding IEP meetings on a timely basis, and irregularities were about at the same level, or \npossibly  even  less  frequent,  than  public  school  systems,  based  upon  my  experience  with \nreviewing these.  Where such timing irregularities were noted, there was usually a reason having \nto do with correctional or behavioral issues (again, not to imply that such reasons are fully \nacceptable, particularly with respect to those wards placed in restrictive programs). \n \nMy main concerns with IEP's and IEP meetings do not relate to particular procedural failings, \nbut rather with more subjective issues of providing the most appropriate settings, curricula, and \naccommodations for wards with disabilities.  These include the following: \n \n(1)  IEP meeting times:  It appears that many IEP meetings occur during school hours.  These \nmeetings should be scheduled at times when a ward does not have to miss scheduled classes.  \nThis change in policy should not create a problem with teachers or administrators involved in the \nIEP, since they are expected to work more than the prescribed 240-minute instruction time. \n \n(2)  General tenor of meetings:  Before broaching this subject, a general discussion of meetings \nattended by wards is necessary.  One positive aspect regarding CYA activities lies in the fact that \nthere is a reasonable amount of dialogue with wards about their treatment and progress.  These \ninclude DDMS hearings and fact finding interviews, case conferences, YAAC hearings, Board \nreviews, etc.  Many of these meetings are undertaken because of behavioral and/or program \nplacement issues.  The demeanor at many of these meetings is authoritative, that is, wards are \nexpected  to  \"get  with  the  program\".    In  most  cases,  this  demeanor  is  understandable  and \ndefensible.  Such an approach, when used properly, can be a part of an effective treatment and \nbehavioral management plan needed to make defiant and oppositional wards (of which there are \nmany) understand that expectations while at the CYA, as well as society's expectations when \nthey are released, are that they must conform to certain standards of behavior and expectations of \nprogress. \n \nHowever, of all the meetings held with wards, IEP meetings should be the second most open \n(behind psychological therapy sessions) in terms of ward involvement.  From my observations, \nwards were rarely involved at a personal level at their IEP meetings.  I do not recall that wards \nwere  specifically  asked  if  they  were  getting  all  of  their  accommodations,  or  if  other \naccommodations would be helpful.  However, the main concern is that even if such questions \nPage 52 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nwere asked, it would be extremely difficult for a ward to respond openly and effectively.  Wards \nthat I privately interviewed expressed a reluctance to express opinions at these meetings, and \nthey exhibited a general confusion about what they could discuss and request.  Furthermore, \nwards  tended  to  think  of  the  IEP  meetings  as  another  \"progress  evaluation\"  meeting.  \nSpecifically, they saw such meetings in the same vein as behavioral management meetings, and \nthey  often  characterized  their  lack  of  academic  progress  and  \"grade-level\"  goals  as  \"bad \nbehavior\".  They also felt that their educational options were limited, a feeling with which I \ngenerally concur, as described in a later section. \n \nI realize that much of this is extremely subjective, and certainly approaches toward wards should \nvary, depending upon the wards specific circumstances (thus the \"individualized\" in IEP).  I did \nnot sense that any indirect coercion on the part of any staff member was mean-spirited, and if it \ndid occur, it was predominately unintentional.  The most probable reason for such an approach is \nthat IEP meetings tend to be highly procedural, with an obvious attempt to follow approved \nformat and legal requirements.  Certainly full legal compliance is necessary, but individualized \nattention should not be conceded as a result. \n \nWards need to be better informed as to the purpose, protocol, and regulations regarding IEP \nmeetings.  Additional orientation should be included as part of the ADA orientation described in \nSection 4.1, before IEP meetings, or both.  Also, in order to rectify the concerns described above, \nI  would  recommend  a  stronger  ward  \"advocate\"  position  during  IEP's,  as  discussed  in  a \nfollowing section. \n \n(3)  Parent, Surrogate, or Advocate Involvement:  IDEA requires that all students under 18 must \nbe represented during IEP meetings by at least one parent or legal guardian.  If a parent or legal \nguardian waives this right of appearance or is not available, the educational entity is required to \nprovide a surrogate parent for purposes of the IEP.  If a student is over the age 18, there is no \nrequirement for parent, guardian, or surrogate involvement, although the student may have a \nrepresentative if the student chooses.  It should be noted that within the context of public school \ndistricts, it is not uncommon for students to have either legal representation and/or their private \npsychologists present during IEP meetings. \n \nAs described in the subsection above, it was my observation that wards typically had little input \nat IEP meetings.  The same would be true for parents, who were usually communicating by \nspeakerphone during IEP meetings.  There was only one parent actually present for all of the IEP \nmeetings that I attended.  It was my observation that the use of a speakerphone during IEP \nmeeting was almost totally ineffective.  Parents did not have any records to review and seemed \ngenerally removed from the evaluation process.  (When the word \"evaluation process\" is used, it \nnot only refers to the evaluation of the student's progress under the IEP, but also to an evaluation \nof how well the school is meeting the individual needs of the student.)  Furthermore, while it \nappeared that parents either had already signed or would sign the appropriate forms, most parents \nPage 53 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nappeared to otherwise possess very little knowledge about the IEP process.  This is not meant to \nimply that the CYA or any public school district is required to undertake extensive parent \ntraining on IDEA and IEP's, although certainly more informational materials for parents seem to \nbe warranted in these cases.  The point intended is that most parents, particularly those who are \ngenerally uninformed about the process, tend to pick up most of the salient points by their \nphysical presence at IEP meetings, and without this presence, cannot function effectively. \n \nI have researched a reasonable amount of applicable sources and case law to determine if a \nschool district is liable for providing the means of actual attendance for a parent at IEP meetings \nas part of their obligation to provide a free appropriate public education.  I found several \ncircumstances where such was provided, but the issue does not seem to be a prevalent one since \nmost parents live within the locale where services are provided.  However, I also could find no \nevidence that such an obligation is not required.  If indeed such a legal basis for not providing \nparent access to IEP meetings exists, I would revise my opinion, but in the absence of such, I feel \nthat the use of a speakerphone is not a realistic alternative for parent attendance at IEP meetings, \nand recommend that the CYA provide the means of travel to IEP meetings for any parent or legal \nguardian of a ward if requested.  Also, all relevant records should be made available to the parent \nor guardian a reasonable time before the meeting. \n \nI had the opportunity to meet only one surrogate parent during my site visits.  This particular \nsurrogate was a volunteer who served in other volunteer capacities at the institution.  He was one \nof two surrogates at the institution, had been a surrogate for about 12 years, and supported about \n25 wards.  While he was clearly dedicated, he was mostly \"self-taught\" through the years of \nservice and indicated he had received no actual training on the ADA or IDEA. \n \nMy observations of parent and surrogate participation in IEP meetings, together with the tenor of \nthe meetings, further reinforces the need for a wards to have a more active advocate during IEP \nmeetings.  Such a concept is not unprecedented.  When a ward goes before the Parole Board for \nconsideration, the institutional parole agent basically serves as an advocate for the ward.  I am \nrecommending no more extensive representation beyond this degree of advocacy.  The advocate \ncould be a CYA staff member (correctional officer, treatment team member, staff psychologist, \ninstitutional parole agent), but the advocate should not be involved in the educational program.  \nEach institution should have a number of such advocates, and a ward should be able to select \nfrom  these.    Advocates  should  be  appropriately  compensated  and  not  burdened  with  these \nadditional responsibilities without adjustments to other job duties.  The presence of the advocate \nwould not alleviate the legal requirement for parent, guardian, or surrogate presence for wards \nunder eighteen.  Advocates should meet with each ward in advance (not the same day) of IEP \nmeetings  to  review  the  ward's  concerns  and  any  specific  requests  the  ward  may  have.  \nCompletion of a pre-prepared form or worksheet by the ward and the advocate at this time would \nhelp to facilitate the actual IEP meeting. \n \nPage 54 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n(4) Modifications and accommodations:  On the positive side, special day class teachers and \nresource specialists appeared to be adept at providing accommodations on a day-to-day, as-\nneeded  basis.    These  teachers  seemed  interested  in  meeting  individual  needs,  and  when \nquestioned,  seemed  generally  knowledgeable  about  each  student's  IEP,  and  perhaps  even \nexceeded the accommodations listed in the IEP in special cases.  The extent to which regular \neducation teachers allowed for IEP accommodations is less clear, since it was not possible or \nappropriate to question them on these topics during the school visits, but I had no specific \nconcerns in this area since most teachers had extensive lesson plans geared toward various \nlearning levels. \n \nOn the negative side, IEP's tend to focus more on \"standardized\" accommodations, geared \ntoward the specific disability than the student with the disability.  The general discussion above \non the tenor of IEP meetings is related to this subject.  The standard IEP Form YA 7.486 (01/00) \nhas  only  a  small  area  for  program  modifications,  and  most  of  those  provided  fall  into  a \nprototypical  range  of  accommodations  (extended  time,  small  group  testing,  clarification  of \ninstructions, etc.).  There is little variation in accommodations described, leading one to surmise \nthat other individualized accommodations are rare.  Modifications provided usually fall within \nrelatively narrow limits.  For example, additional time for tests seems to be the most operable \nsolution,  with  alternative  to  tests  themselves  (individual  exercises,  writings,  or  laboratory \nactivities) being rarely considered. \n \nI would recommend that the California Education Authority revise its Educational Manual to \ninclude more extensive types of program modifications that facility IEP teams could utilize in the \nIEP process.  However, at a more philosophical level, IEP teams should be made more aware of \nthe  necessity  to  accommodate  the  individual  students  needs  with  whatever  reasonable \nmodifications that may be appropriate, irrespective of their inclusion in the types of typical \naccommodations recommended. \n \nWithout making transition plans a separate category, most of the same discussions as above \ncould just as easily apply to transition plans (also covered in YA 7.486), which again tend to be \nmore of a generalized, \"fill-in-the-box\" type, rather than individualized.  One suggestion would \nbe to prepare a series of sections on the form, with a first section asking, \"What will make this \nstudent's transition experience unique from others?\" and with a second section asking, \"What \nactivities or strategies could assist in making this transition?\" \n \n(b)  Section 504 Programs \n \nThis particular subject was not included in my original scope of work, but it should be realized \nthat a school district has obligations to students with disabilities under Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, in addition to IDEA and ADA.  Historically, at some public school \ndistricts,  a  student  with  a  disability  may  be  excluded  from  appropriate  services  and \nPage 55 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \naccommodations because the student may not meet what some feel are the more restrictive \nrequirements of IDEA, but still are a \"qualified person with a disability\" under the ADA or \nSection 504.  I did not specifically observe that such was the case at CYA school sites, but an \nactive 504 program can sometimes be more efficient and effective for some students with \nspecific disabilities.  Furthermore, a number of students may sometimes be misplaced into \nspecial education when a 504 program may better suit their individual needs and create a greater \ndegree of inclusion and mainstreaming. \n \nDuring my site visits, I found some active 504 programs, albeit very limited.  These programs \nmay be helpful in providing alternatives to the more restrictive special education programs, \nparticularly for those students who are over the age of 21.  I would recommend that the CYA \ninstitute  a  program  that  will  increase  the  awareness  of  students,  parents,  and  facility \nadministrators  to  504  programs,  and  coordinate  school  site  504  programs  so  that  there  is \nconsistency agency-wide. \n \n(c)  Alternative Education \n \nThis item was included in my original scope of work.  Alternative education, in its most accurate \nform, consists of specific and well-described alternatives to standard curricula.  It may include \nindependent study programs, but is usually more precise in defining basic goals and objectives to \nserve a wider range of student needs.  It is sometimes confused with special day classes held as \npart of special education programs, but its goals are vastly different, and it should be part of the \nregular education program (although certainly special education students could be included in \nalternative education programs).  These programs are particularly applicable and effective for \nstudents with disabilities. \n \nDuring my site visits, I saw little evidence of the presence of an effective alternative education \nprogram.  There is also no significant mention of alternative education program in the Education \nManual or other documents provided to me.  Certain teachers and instructors had classes (mostly \nquasi-vocational in nature) that could be part of an effective alternative education program.  \nHowever, there was no cohesive program integrating overall student goals and objective in these \nclasses. \n \nI would recommend that the CYA establish an active alternative education program, with an \noverall full-time coordinator, and develop goals, objectives, and model curricula in this area. \n \n(d)  Vocational Education \n \nThe educational experts' report cites the vocational offerings at the various facilities as being \nexemplary.  I was also impressed the content and curriculum of vocational courses offered, the \nvocational facilities, and expertise and dedication of vocational teachers.  I have no significant \nPage 56 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nconcerns  with  these  programs,  nor  would  I  offer  any  specific  recommendations  for \nimprovements in these three areas. \n \nUnfortunately, I do have major concerns about the financial and staffing cutbacks to these \nprograms in the recent past.  As good as these vocational classes are, the only problem with them \nis (like several other programs) that there are just not enough of them.  Cutbacks have worsened \neven since the educational experts' reports, which is disheartening since these experts lauded the \nprograms so highly.  I was not able to ascertain the exact dollar value or percentage of recent \ncutbacks, and such a detailed monetary analysis is most likely beyond the scope of this inquiry.  \nBut  it  is  clear  that  recent  cutbacks  have  been  major,  with  severe  quality  of  education \nconsequences.  It is also clear that cutbacks have partially been the result of general downsizing \nand  a  decrease  in  ward  population.    Instead  of  cutting  back  these  vocational  programs  in \nproportion to population, it would be preferable to use this opportunity to increase vocational \ncoverage to a wider range of wards.  This has not happened. \n \nVocational facilities are in generally good physical condition, and despite some architectural \nbarriers that could be readily remedied, they are generally accessible to persons with disabilities.   \nYet during my visits, most of the vocational classrooms were not in use during the school day.  \nExcessive school violence and greater need for security in non-classroom facilities is certainly a \nvalid concern, but hopefully, additional funding or appropriate reallocations can help to alleviate \nthese issues. \n \nFor the purpose of this inquiry, the effect of underutilized vocational programs has its greatest \nnegative impact on wards with disabilities.  Vocational programs can make up an important part \nof alternative ways of learning for many students with specific learning disabilities and other \nmental or speech impairments that make traditional learning methods difficult.  For example, in \none  excellent  carpentry/building  vocational  class  at  Preston  YCF,  the  teacher  effectively \nintegrated math and reading comprehension into the daily vocational activities.  Also, students \nwith  disabilities  can  learn  valuable  life  and  vocational  skills,  similar  to  curricula  in  more \ntraditional occupational therapy programs, and gain justifiable high school credits for doing so. \n \nIt was also unclear if the Trade Advisory Committees at each facility were actively meeting per \nSection 4500 of the Education Manual.  It appears that the cutbacks have also affected this \nmandated activity.  If so, these committees should be re-established to deal with the declining \nenrollment and availability of vocational programs at each facility and to make recommendations \non how these programs can be reinstated and improved. \n \n(e)  Testing \n \nAnother problematic aspects of the overall CYA special education program lies in the inability to \nprovide either (1) effective accommodations during testing for wards with disabilities or (2) \nPage 57 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nalternative assessments where it is clear that common testing accommodations are not effective.  \nIt  should  be  noted  at  the  outset  that  this  is  not  necessarily  intended  to  specifically  be  an \nindictment of the CYA, because sometimes, the CYA may be provided with limited choices of \naccommodations for certain standardized tests, as described below.  However, the CYA does \nhave some choices in the tests it administers, in the way test results are utilized, and in the ways \nwaivers of test results are approved. \n \nI  was  able  to  observe,  on  an  informal  basis,  individual  proficiency  testing  of  two  special \neducation students.  I also asked many of the special education students I interviewed about \naccommodations during testing.  These observations and inquiries indicated problems with the \naccommodations - not necessarily that they were not provided (although that was a problem in \nseveral instances), but that those that were allowed were ineffective as auxiliary aids for the \nindividual student in the testing process. \n \nAs an example, CASAS (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System) proficiency tests \nare routinely given to special education students for various purposes.  After one of the testing \nsessions, the proctor indicated to me that accommodations were provided to all special education \nstudents in accordance with those allowed by CASAS requirements and that in some instances, \nalternate test forms were provided by CASAS.  Such a situation is somewhat consistent with \nCASAS  policy,  as  described  in  the  CASAS  document  \"Guidelines  for  Providing \nAccommodations Using CASAS Assessment Testing for Learners with Disabilities.\"  (My report \ndoes not attempt to evaluate policies of CASAS with respect to recommending accommodations, \nas doing so would be beyond the scope of inquiry.)  Nevertheless, the CASAS document clearly \nstates that accommodation recommendations are just that, and the testing entity must take the \nresponsibility for appropriate accommodations based upon the need of the student.  Based upon \nmy observations and interviews, it appears that the CYA falls short in providing reasonably \neffective testing accommodations for many wards with disabilities, similar to be limits placed on \ngeneral educational accommodations described in the subsection (a) above.  The document does \nstate that CASAS test forms are not to be altered without CASAS approval, and it seems the only \nalternative for students who cannot appropriately use the test forms is to not take the specific \nCASAS test. \n \nAnother area of concern is the state-mandated California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE).  \nBy  law,  special  education  students  must  be  allowed  to  take  the  CASHEE  with  the \naccommodations  or  modifications  specified  in  their  IEP's.    (Again,  the  discussion  of  these \nmodifications in subsection (a) applies to these issues, and in many cases, it is felt that these are \nnot sufficient.)  The law also stipulates that if accommodations are provided, the school principal \nmust ask the school's governing board for a waiver of the requirement for a passing score \nwithout modifications.  I did not find that this waiver procedure was utilized effectively.  I would \nstrongly recommend that the schools request such waivers where appropriate (which should be, \nin effect, for all special education students with testing modifications) and that the school's \nPage 58 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \ngoverning body approve these waivers appropriately so that students with disabilities can receive \nthe equivalent of a passing score in these cases. \n \n(f)  Libraries: \n \nLibraries  appeared  to  be  in  good  conditions  and  reasonably  stocked  with  materials  at  all \nfacilities, although some were more used than others.  Funding cutbacks had reduced staff at \nseveral locations, and while this is certainly not a desirable scenario, libraries could still be \nusable with adequate supervision and security. \n \nMost  libraries  were  generally  accessible  to  students  with  mobility  impairments,  except  for \nrelatively minor barriers that could be readily mitigated (refer to the accessibility barrier surveys \nfor details).  Most libraries were mostly inaccessible to students with visual impairments, with no \nBraille books, no large print books, and few books on tape.  In order to serve these students, \naccommodations would need to be provided on a case-by-case basis, although there was no \nevidence that such had been done for students with vision problems, or could be done effectively \nin the short term.  For example, one ward with a visual impairment had an ophthalmologist's \nreport that recommended the student be provided with documents in at least 20-point type, but \nthe student indicated that this had not been done.  Students who were deaf or hard of hearing \nwould have a significant decrease in materials available, with no effective substitute for audio \ntapes, CD's, audio computer programs, or other audio-visual materials. \n \nWhile  it  appeared  that  most  libraries  had  a  sufficient  amount  of  materials  present  for  the \npopulation served, a number of wards interviewed mentioned a lack of the type of pleasure \nreading they liked.  It seems that certain books or types of books are popular among groups, and \nthere is often only one copy.  Certainly the goal of the library should be to foster reading of any \ntype, and such a service is particularly valuable for wards with specific learning disabilities, \nspeech and language disabilities, and developmental delays.  I would recommend that the library \nstaff (or the most appropriate teaching staff) canvas wards on a regular basis to determine what \nspecific books are needed and budgets prepared to support pleasure reading.  It was also unclear \nhow textbooks were distributed to wards for study at the living units, and it is possible that \ntextbooks were not always readily available, although I could not verify the exact situation in this \nregard. \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Undertake a long-term, comprehensive study on ways to improve the salaries, benefits, and \nworking conditions of credentialed general and special education teachers, and to improve \nteacher attendance. \n2.  Undertake a comprehensive study on ways to obtain qualified (not necessarily credentialed) \nsubstitute teachers on short-term bases. \nPage 59 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n3.  Re-arrange  the  daily  schedules  of  students  who  take  part  in  special  treatment  or  work \nprograms so that they do not miss scheduled classes. \n4.  Prepare  and  implement  a  system  of  positive  and  constructive  reinforcement  for  good \nattendance for students enrolled in special education (whether such a program would be \nadvantageous for all students is beyond the scope of this report). \n5.  Investigate alternative ways to resolve issues of inadequate IEP records with the Counties, so \nthat special education students can be admitted on a timely basis. \n6.  Provide additional ward and parent orientation, either at the time of initial testing or at the \noverall  ADA  orientation,  or  both,  on  special  education  programs  and  individualized \neducation plans (IEP's).  \n7.  Schedule IEP meetings at times when a ward does not have to miss scheduled classes. \n8.  Conduct IEP meetings to allow a significant degree of input from wards and parents, and \nfoster a positive environment for open dialogue. \n8.  Provide the means of travel to IEP meetings for any parent or legal guardian of a ward, if \nrequested, and use a speakerphone only as an emergency alternative. \n9.  Provide training for surrogate parents on the ADA, IDEA, special education programs, and \nIEP's.  \n10. Provide for a CYA staff member to serve in an \"advocate\" role on behalf of the student at \nIEP meetings. \n11. Revise the Educational Manual to include more extensive types of program modifications \nthat facility IEP teams could utilize in the IEP process, but also attempt to accommodate the \nindividual students needs with whatever reasonable modifications that may be appropriate, \nirrespective of their inclusion in the types of typical accommodations recommended. \n12.  Institute  a  program  that  will  increase  the  awareness  of  students,  parents,  and  facility \nadministrators to Section 504 programs, and coordinate school site 504 programs so that \nthere is consistency agency-wide. \n13.  Establish an active alternative education program, with an overall full-time coordinator, and \ndevelop goals, objectives, and model curricula in this area. \n14.  Institute policies to deal with the declining availability of vocational programs at each \nfacility  and  provide  recommendations  on  how  these  programs  can  be  reinstated  and \nimproved. \n15.  Increase effective accommodations during testing for wards with disabilities, and/or provide \nalternative assessments where it is clear that available testing accommodations are not \neffective, including for standardized proficiency tests. \n16.  Where appropriate, request waivers from the CAHSEE requirements (which should be, in \neffect, for all special education students with testing modifications), and assure that the \nschool's  governing  body  approves  these  waivers  appropriately  so  that  students  with \ndisabilities can receive the equivalent of a passing score in these cases. \n17.  Revise library policies so that students with communication-related disabilities have access \nto alternative formats. \nPage 60 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.7  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards with Disabilities Access to Recreation \n \nRecreational programs vary at each facility, but in general, wards are offered free time to use \noutdoor recreational areas (basketball courts, handball courts, exercise areas, etc.) on a consistent \nbasis.  Use of indoor facilities (gymnasiums, pools) was not prevalent during my site visits, and \nusage is reportedly limited due to security concerns. \n \nThe major exception to open recreation noted during the site visits was for wards in temporary \ndetention at each facility, in which case wards would get only one hour out of the individual unit \nper 24-hour period.  This is typically accomplished by placing these wards in outdoor fenced \nareas, usually about 10 feet by 25 feet in size.  It is beyond the scope of this report to evaluate the \neffect of this policy, except as it would affect the recreational needs of wards with disabilities.  \nFor wards with mobility impairments, including those persons who use wheelchairs, crutches, \nprosthetics, or other mobility aids, confinement to small spaces could have long-term negative \nhealth implications.  At a minimum, these individuals should have regular intervals of specific \nand repetitive body movements to counteract the inactivity of injured or unused muscles, joints, \netc.  Persons with mobility impairments have individualized requirements for physical therapy \nand most rely on physical therapists to continuously update the necessary regimen.  The lack of \nrecreation  and  therapy  for  these  wards  can  and  most  likely  will  have  long-term  negative \nconsequences on the physical improvement of disability-related conditions or general health. \n \nFor other wards with physical disabilities, there was little indication that any adaptive education \nprograms were in operation, although there was mention of a past program at O. H. Close YCF.  \nFor example, the pool at Ventura YCF was in use during my site visit, and this would be an \nexcellent opportunity for adaptive programs for those with both physical and developmental \ndisabilities.  This may have been occurring on an informal basis, but I could find no record of \nspecific adaptive physical education programs in any IEP\"s. \n \n \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Provide the opportunity for wards with physical disabilities to engage in individualized \nphysical therapy exercises, including wards with disabilities in temporary detention. \n2.  Evaluate opportunities for the inclusion of adaptive physical education programs in special \neducation students' IEP's, and provide for a recreation / adaptive physical education director \nat each facility to ensure that adequate programs are available and that wards with IEP's \nparticipate in these programs. \nPage 61 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.8  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards' with Disabilities Access to Communication \n \nGeneral Discussion of Effective Communication \n \nBefore an evaluation of wards' access to communications can be begun, it is believed appropriate \nto discuss some of the requirements for effective communication for persons with disabilities.  \nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities are required to ensure that all program recipients, \nincluding students, parents, employees, employment applicants, and members of the general \npublic with disabilities are able to experience communication methods that are as effective as \nthat provided to people without disabilities.  Persons with visual, hearing, and speech disabilities \nmust  all  have  the  opportunity  to  receive  or  present  communications  in  a  manner  that  is \nappropriate and effective.  Communication support must be provided in a manner that enables \npersons with disabilities to participate on an equal basis with all others, unless the result would \ncause a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or cause an \n“undue” financial or administrative burden.  Such exceptions rarely apply.  It is important to note \nthat the fundamental alteration/undue burden exception does not apply to the provision of related \naids and services that are necessary to ensure a free appropriate public education to qualified \nstudents with disabilities. \n \nThere  are  two  major  types  of  communication  barriers  that  prevent  or  detract  from \ncommunication effectiveness: \n(1) Visual: Print materials, visual presentations and displays, and signage often present \nbarriers to people with limited vision. \n(2)  Aural/oral:  “Aural”  refers  to  information  that  is  heard;  “oral”  refers  to  spoken \ncommunication.  A person who is deaf or hard of hearing experiences barriers related to \naural communication.  The same person may be able to communicate orally, however.  \nA person who has a speech impairment or a cognitive impairment that affects speech \nmay  experience  barriers  in  communicating  orally  but  have  no  difficulty  receiving \ninformation that is conveyed aurally.  Each person may require different auxiliary aids \nand services in order to be provided equally effective communication. \n \nCurrently available technologies provide a variety of effective communication options, and this \nsection suggests possible applications.  The field changes rapidly and ADA Coordinators should \nkeep abreast of emerging technologies.  It is important to note that the specific method of \nproviding effective communication may vary from program to program and from individual to \nindividual.  Therefore, the process must take into account the specific needs of the persons \ninvolved and their particular disabilities.  The descriptions of technologies described herein are \nnot exhaustive nor necessarily complete.  The technologies presented here may also be used as \nrelated aids and services that are provided to qualified students with disabilities as part of their \nfree appropriate public education. \n \nPage 62 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nMaterials presented in a visual format can inhibit or prevent communication with persons who \nare blind or partially sighted.  The following are ways that effective communication may be \nprovided for such persons with these types of disabilities: \n(1) Alternative Formats:  It is essential that information be available in a variety of formats in \norder to be accessible to users with a variety of disabilities.  For example, schools should \nensure that persons who are blind or have low vision have access to materials in Braille, \non audio tapes, in large print, or in other appropriate formats. \n(a) Braille:  Braille is a tactile representation of written or printed language.  It consists of \ncharacters made up of arrangements of raised dots.  Not all blind persons read Braille, \nbut many prefer it to tapes because it is easier to scan, easier to refer back to for \ninformation, and easier to reference. \n(b) Large print:  Many people who have limited vision are able to read large print.  Print \nis measured in “point” size.  Standard print is usually 10-12 point.  Large print can be \nproduced at low cost using a photocopier that can enlarge.  Many computer programs \nhave the option of printing enlarged documents or formatting text in various sizes. \n(c) Audio tapes:  Making audio tapes of such program materials as textbooks and course \nlistings is often a good alternative to written information.  Some people who are blind \nor visually impaired cannot read, or prefer not to read, Braille or large print.  Tapes \nare also sometimes helpful to people with learning disabilities such as dyslexia. \n \nPeople with various disabilities may be unable to receive or generate spoken communication.  \nThe following are some of the most widely used techniques and devices that can assist with \ncommunication: \n(1) Interpreters:  The use of interpreters is the most commonly used method for providing \neffective  communication  to  persons  who  are  deaf  or  hard  of  hearing.    When  sign \nlanguage interpretation is necessary, Title II requires that it be provided by a “qualified \ninterpreter.”  Under Title II, the term “qualified interpreter” is defined as an individual \nwho is “able to interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially, both receptively and \nexpressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary”.  To satisfy this requirement, \nthe interpreter must have the proven ability to effectively communicate the type of \ninformation being conveyed.  The interpreter qualifications most appropriate in each \ninstance will vary.  Certified interpreters should be used in nearly all cases; it is generally \nnot appropriate to use a family member or companion as an interpreter.  A person who is \ndeaf or hard of hearing has the right to request an impartial interpreter. \n(2) Writing:  In some situations, there are simple alternatives to spoken communication.  Pen \nand paper may be an easy form of communication in situations where communication is \nsimple.  In a more complicated situations, other methods should be considered. \n(3) Computer-Aided Real-Time Reporting (CART): This service is generally used in meeting \nor conference settings, but the service may also be provided for students in classes.  Real-\ntime reporters type out words as they are being spoken in a meeting or class, and the text \nis simultaneously displayed on a computer monitor, video monitor, or projection screen. \nPage 63 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n(4) Assistive Listening Devices or Systems:  These devices can be used to enhance hearing in \none-on-one  discussions  or  in  meeting  rooms.    They  can  be  fixed  or  portable.    FM \nsystems, for example, use a microphone connected to an FM signal-sending device that \ncan be attached to the speaker.  The listener wears a portable headset that can be used \nanywhere in the room and is able to receive the amplified sound.  Multiple listeners can \nbenefit simultaneously from this type of system. \n(5) TTY's / Telecommunication Devices for the Deaf (also called a TDD or a text telephone, \nalthough the preferred acronym is TTY, standing for “teletypewriter”):  Although Section \n504 regulations does not specifically address TTY’s, Title II of the ADA specifically \nrequires that where public entities communicate with the students, parents, employees, \nemployment applicants, or the general public by telephone, TTY’s or equally effective \nmeans  must  be  used  to  communicate  with  persons  who  have  hearing  or  speech \ndisabilities.  These devices provide a printout or digital display (or both) that enables a \nperson who is deaf or hard of hearing to hold a two-way conversation through the written \nword. \n(6) Telephone relay services:  In California, telephone conversations can be relayed from a \nTTY-user to a non-TTY user by the California Relay Service (800-735-2929 for TTY \nusers; 800-735-2922 for voice use) free of charge. \n(7) Telephone Amplification.  Many hearing aids have a telephone setting that can amplify \nsound if an appropriate handset is used.  The local telephone company can provide a \nhandset with the appropriate magnetic field intensity to be compatible with this type of \nhearing aid setting.  Battery-powered, portable handset amplifiers are also available.  The \namplifier can slip over the handset of most telephones.  Accessible public telephones are \nrequired to have this feature built-in. \n(8) Adaptations for Computers.  Since operating a personal computer is essentially visual \ntalk, users who are deaf generally do not experience significant difficulties with computer \ntechnology.  However,  schools  and  public  entities  should  insure  that  important \ninformation conveyed by beeps or speech during computer-related tasks is also displayed \nvisually for the user unable to benefit from the auditory information.  Computer operating \nsystems often have built-in options for visually displaying auditory alerts.  If necessary, a \nflashing light signal should be installed that echoes the beeps. \n(9) Electronic Speech Aids.  A number of devices are available that support the exchange of \ninformation electronically.  Among them is a small device that accepts and displays typed \ntext.  Such a device could be stored in a library for ready use by persons who are deaf.  \nSpeech synthesizers may also be used to facilitate communications with persons who \nhave speech impairments. \n(10) Captioning Television and Videotape Programming.  Audio portions of television and \nvideotape  programming  produced  or  played  by  public  entities  are  subject  to  the \nrequirement to provide equally effective communication for individuals who are deaf or \nhard  of  hearing.    Closed  captioning  of  such  programs  is  sufficient  to  meet  this \nrequirement  A school should be able to provide audio-visual materials used for class \nPage 64 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nwork, or which are otherwise intended for public education, to carry captions.  Closed \ncaptioning is an ideal format because the captioning is unseen unless it is needed. \n(11) Decoders.  When a “closed captioned” film or video is shown, a decoder is used to \n“open” the captions and make them appear on screen. \n \nWhere communication by telephone is a function of a particular component or program, TTY’s \nshould be made available to those persons who require them.  TTY\"s may be portable, but must \nbe readily available.  Appropriate staff should be trained in the use of TTY’s.  Where TTY-\nequipped pay phones or portable TTY’s exist, clear signage should be posted indicating the \nlocation of the TTY. \n \nIn order to provide equal access to their programs and services, schools are required by Title II of \nthe ADA to make appropriate auxiliary or related aids and services available when they are \nnecessary to ensure effective communication.  Furthermore, auxiliary aids and services are often \nrequired to provide equally effective programmatic accessibility in areas not specifically related \nto communications.   \n \nAuxiliary aids for people with visual disabilities include providing access to printed information \nthrough audio-tape cassettes, computer diskettes, Braille or large print materials, as described \nabove.  However, within a school setting, auxiliary services could be provided through the use of \nqualified readers, providing verbal descriptions of action and visual information to enhance the \naccessibility of performances and presentations, and making a staff member available to enable a \nperson with limited vision to find his or her way along an unfamiliar route. \n \nThere may often be an overlap between the provision of auxiliary aids and services that are \ndesigned to ensure effective communication and related aids and services that are necessary to \nprovide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to qualified students with disabilities.  Public \nschools must provide regular or special education students related aids and services designed to \nmeet the individual educational needs of each qualified student with a disability.  The concept of \n“related  aids  and  services”  applies  to  any  supplementary  aids,  adjustments,  and  services, \nincluding  those  that  are  communication-related,  that  are  necessary  to  ensure  effective \ncommunication and that are necessary to ensure FAPE.  A school system must give each person \nwith a disability an opportunity to request the auxiliary aid or service of his or her choice.  \nFurthermore, schools must honor this request unless they can demonstrate that another aid or \nservice will be effective for the individual requesting the service, the proposed action would \nfundamentally alter the service, program, or activity, or that the action would result in undue \nfinancial and administrative burdens.  Even where a school can demonstrate a fundamental \nalteration or an undue burden, the school must take other measures to ensure that it does not \ndiscriminate against individuals with disabilities.  Deference to the request of the individual with \na disability is crucial because of the range of disabilities, the variety of auxiliary aids and \nservices, and the various circumstances requiring effective communication.  It is important to \nPage 65 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nconsult with the individual to determine the most appropriate auxiliary aid or service because the \nindividual with a disability is most familiar with his or her disability and is in the best position to \ndetermine what type of aid or service will be effective. \n \nEffective Communication within the CYA \n \nSection 3.1 describes the wards with disabilities who might have communication needs within \nthe CYA at the time of my site visits.  These included wards who might be deaf or hard of \nhearing, as well as wards with varying degrees of visual, speech, or cognitive impairments. \n \nDuring my site visits, there were two wards who had total loss of hearing, and I interviewed both \nof these wards.  These wards were currently being provided with American Sign Language \ninterpreters for most of their school day.  Both were involved in school activities and reported no \ncurrent problems with the lack of qualified interpreters during classroom activities.  However, \nthey both indicated that there had been some problems in the past, and it was good to hear that \neducational accommodations were improving and were no longer considered by them to be a \nsignificant problem.  The availability of qualified interpreters during other activities appeared to \nbe less frequent.  It appeared that for treatment programs, case conferences, hearings, and other \nformal activities, interpreters were usually provided.  However for social, recreational, and \nreligious activities, it appeared that interpreters were much less frequent, and it could be difficult \nfor these wards to participate fully in all of these programs.  It should be noted that for wards in \nan  institutional  setting,  there  is  a  fine  line  between  ward  independence  and  the  need  to \ncommunicate through an interpreter.  For example, neither of these wards indicated that they \nwould want to have an interpreter \"shadow\" them for an entire day, as that would be more \npersonally intrusive than having an interpreter available for just the required activities.  With this \nin mind, these wards seemed to be reasonably comfortable with the current degree of interpreter \nsupport. \n \nFor wards who were hard of hearing but still had some degree of hearing acuity, the issue of \ninterpreter support seemed to be more problematic.  For example, one ward who had severe \nhearing loss that was worsening and who was still using hearing aids had difficulty getting an \ninterpreter at all.  Many persons who are hard of hearing still need an interpreter because even \nthough there may be some auditory acuity, background noise and other environmental factors \ncan make hearing, particularly within the educational or institutional context, extremely difficult.  \nThis particular ward mentioned that when she was not in the CYA, she was provided with an \ninterpreter at her school and for other activities in which she participated.  However, at the CYA, \nshe was unable to convince the treatment team that an interpreter was mandatory.  As a result, \nshe found that hearing aids really did not fully solve her communication problems, and her \nreluctance to wear a hearing aid was cited by both the correctional and educational staff as an \nindifference to taking part in educational and treatment programs, which was most likely not the \ncase. \nPage 66 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nThere  also  seem  to  be  some  contractual  and  scheduling  issues  with  interpreters  at  several \ninstitutions.  How the CYA goes about contracting for interpreter services is beyond the scope of \nthis inquiry.  However, it is clear that an evaluation of how the services are contracted needs to \noccur at a number of facilities.  While it is common to contract for these services through \ncommunity  service  organizations,  many  public  entities  have  found  it  advantageous  from  a \nfinancial  standpoint  to  advertise  for  staff  positions  that  include  qualified  American  Sign \nLanguage interpreters.  This may serve as a more economical and practical way to provide the \ninterpreter services that are required. \n \nAnother common concern at a number of facilities involves the procedures for a ward's obtaining \nhearing aids or other auxiliary devices.  Staff voiced several complaints that wards would not \nwear their hearing aids and that they used the lack of hearing as an excuse for not participating or \nfor poor performance in classes and treatment programs.  On the other hand, some wards \ncomplained that many of the hearing aids were bulky and not as effective as those that they had \nused before they entered the CYA.  It is my opinion that the reality is probably somewhere in \nbetween these two different perspectives.  In other words, it appears that the CYA needs to be \nmore proactive in searching out more \"user friendly\" hearing aids or other auxiliary aids, such as \npersonal assistive listening devices, that would be more effective in meeting the individual \nward's needs.  At the same time, it is also possible that some wards may attempt to gain some \ndegree of leverage over their situation by citing the lack of appropriate aids as an excuse for less \nthan ideal behavior or poor work.  The CYA needs to evaluate these situations individually and \nbecome more adept at differentiating between the two perspectives. \n \nAnother issue involves the presence of wards who have been losing their hearing for a period of \ntime such that the prognosis is that they will lose all hearing in the future.  Such a condition can \nbe a traumatic experience, particularly for a teen-ager, and since the CYA is responsible for \nproviding counseling in a variety of areas, it seems appropriate for the CYA to counsel these \nwards on issues around total hearing loss.  There are no current programs within the CYA that \neffectively  address  the  extreme  anxiety  and  practical  issues  involved  with  hearing  loss.  \nTherefore, I would strongly recommend that the CYA closely monitor the progress of these \nwards and take the appropriate steps to bring in outside treatment experts to assist in dealing with \nthis potentially traumatic occurrence.   \n \nTo summarize concerns and issues over communication with wards who are deaf and hard of \nhearing, it appears that the CYA is interested in taking steps to identify and provide some degree \nof  accommodation  and  modification  to  programs  that  is  required  by  the  ADA  in  such \ncircumstances.  However, it appears that often the CYA does not take the most appropriate steps \nor provide accommodations in the most effective manner.  One somewhat upsetting experience \nthat I had during my site visits will perhaps serve as a good example of some of these issues.  I \ninterviewed one ward who was deaf prior to a case management conference that was scheduled \nPage 67 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nlater in that day.  During the interview, the ward was very open in expressing his problems, \nincluding those that might have been his own making, as well as those things that he hoped \nwould come out of the case conference.  I believe that after the interview, I had a relatively good \nsense of what issues were important to the ward and how the ward saw his own progress in his \ntreatment, educational, and work programs.  As I sat in on the case conferences, I was quite \nsurprised that the ward's own interests were not really taken into account at any time throughout \nthe case conference. Even though an interpreter was present, basic communication was the \nprimary drawback, and the case management specialist allowed the lack of communication to \nthwart open dialogue between the parties.  It was also common for the case specialist to refer to \nthe ward in the third person; for example, asking the interpreter: \"Does Joe think that...\".  While \nthis  is  a  common  mistake  for  hearing  people  to  make,  it  is  still  unacceptable.    The  case \nconference actually digressed into a less than cordial tone on the part of everyone involved, and \nfrom my observations, much of the reason was the ward's inability to communicate his concerns \nand needs effectively.  I also believe that much of the reason rested on the interpreter, who \ntended  to  interpret  emotions  in  what  I  felt was  an  inaccurate  manner.    During  my  earlier \ninterview with the ward, I had asked the ward what he wanted to come out of the case conference \nthat was to take place, and he mentioned some very practicable resolutions that did not appear to \nbe unreasonable or excessive.  However, during the case conference, the ward was never really \nallowed to communicate these.  During my site visits, I never interacted with the activities I was \nobserving, but I did make one exception here, and at the end of the conference, I interjected some \nquestions that I thought would help to bring out some of the things the ward had told me.  I \nfound that these were quickly dismissed.  This example is not necessarily intended to cast blame \non any of the participants, but rather to show that while formal and procedural accommodations \nmay appear to be in place, the reality is that it takes a concerted effort to assure that wards with \ndisabilities are not deprived of the communication that other wards are afforded. \n \nWith respect to telephone communications with families, all of the wards interviewed who \nneeded TTY's for these activities stated that they were available, and when I asked to see TTY's \nat several locations, portable units were available. \n \nAs for wards with visual impairments, much of the discussion of visual communication has \nalready been described in Section 4.2.  I will not repeat those issues in this section, except to \nsummarize the fact that while the CYA appears to be providing auxiliary aids for some (but \nnecessarily all) wards with visual impairments, many of the aids appear to be ineffective and do \nnot allow these wards to participate in programs at the same level as other wards. \n \nPage 68 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Alternative formats:  Provide alternative formats (Braille, large print, audio cassettes, sign \nlanguage interpreters, captioning, computer-aided real-time reporting, etc.) or auxiliary aids \nand services required by wards, students, parents, or the public.  All programs that prepare \nand provide written materials should include a notice of availability of alternative formats in \nwritten materials.  Site representatives may provide alternative formats independently, but \nsecuring  and  assuring  that  proper  alternative  formats  are  provided  when  requested  is \nultimately  the  ADA  Coordinator's  responsibility.    A  list  of  qualified  Braillists,  audio \nrecording volunteers, and computer assistants should be developed and maintained by the \nfacility and agency-wide programmatic ADA Coordinators. \n2. Curriculum-related accommodations:  Provide reasonable communication accommodations as \nrequired, including special assistive devices to mobility-impaired, orthopedically-impaired, \nhearing-impaired, or visually-impaired students in conjunction with the administering of \ncurriculum, instruction, or extra-curricular activities. \n3.  Sign language interpreters:  Provide a qualified interpreter when requested by a ward, parent, \nor member of the public who has a hearing or speaking impairment.  The policy of providing \ninterpreters should be incorporated into each school policy manual and specifically described \non each meeting notice.  Site representatives may secure qualified interpreters independently, \nbut securing and assuring interpreters are provided when requested should ultimately be the \nfacility and agency-wide programmatic ADA Coordinators' responsibility.  A list of qualified \ninterpreters should be developed and maintained by the ADA Coordinators. \n4. Testing formats:  All student programs, including comprehensive testing programs, should \ndevelop alternative formats of testing where necessary due to students’ disabilities. \n5.  TTY’s:  Each facility should have at least one, and probably more, readily available TTY’s at \nappropriate locations as may be required for the use of wards.  Appropriate staff should be \ntrained as to their proper usage. \n6.  Monitor  the  progress  of  those  wards  experiencing  significant  hearing  loss  and  take  the \nappropriate steps to bring in outside treatment experts to assist in dealing with this occurrence. \n \nPage 69 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.9  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards' with Disabilities Access to Visitation \n \nVisitation by family members and friends is one of a typical ward's most awaited activities.  The \nvalue of positive reinforcement from family members and friends is a major part of the treatment \nprogram at all of the institutions that I visited. \n \nThe architectural barrier surveys also relate to this particular aspect of program accessibility.  \nThere is an additional element, however, that is also involved that makes it different from other \nprogram access issues that also have architectural barrier implications.  For a ward with a \ndisability to access the program of visitation, family members and friends who might have a \ndisability and are coming to visit the ward would also need to have access to the visiting area in \norder for program access to be provided.  Therefore, for this particular inquiry, program access \nfor persons with disabilities other than words should be considered in the evaluation. \n \nAt each of the facilities I visited, I conducted a general review of the visitation facility in order to \nevaluate what items, either physical or program-related, would either enhance or reduce program \naccess  for  wards  with  disabilities.    Four  of  the  facilities  visited  had  newly  constructed  or \nrenovated visitation areas that were very accessible and that should provide excellent program \naccessibility for both of wards with disabilities and visitors.  This would include accessible \nparking spaces, entranceways, security gates, restrooms and drinking fountains, and seating \nareas.  However, two of these facilities at Ventura YCF and Preston YCF were not in use at the \ntime of my site visits to due funding cutbacks for security and correctional officers during \nvisitation.  This is very unfortunate, because the older facilities for visiting at both institutions \nexhibited a number of accessibility barriers that would make visitation difficult for both of wards \nand  visitors  with  disabilities.    The  other  four  facilities  visited  had  varying  degrees  of \naccessibility. \n \nAll facilities visited had an adequate number of accessible and van-accessible parking spaces \nproperly located in front of the exterior entrance to the visitation areas, and these areas need little \nupgrading.  The security gates at three facilities were too narrow and would not be accessible for \na visitor using a wheelchair or other mobility aid to enter the facility without some type of \nassistance.  The restroom facilities both for wards and visitors at all of the older visitation areas \nwere generally not fully accessible, and these need to be upgraded for accessibility. \n \nThe accessibility barrier surveys depict the specific areas needing improvement at five of the \nfacilities, and these should be prioritized and rectified as soon as possible.  It should be noted \nthat visitors' facilities at Heman G. Stark YCF and El Paso de Robles YCF have not been \nsurveyed, and this should be accomplished to assure future access to these programs. \n \nThe programmatic access issues at visitation areas were deemed to be minor, and there were very \nfew programs that took place during visitation that would require auxiliary aids or other assistive \nPage 70 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \ndevices for those who had communications needs, although if programs occur, accommodations \nshould be provided.   \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures  \n \n1.  Secure the appropriate funding for security and correctional officers so that the new visitation \nfacilities at Ventura YCF and Preston YCF can be properly utilized during visitation hours. \n2.  Review or complete the architectural barrier surveys for all visitation facilities, and upgrade \nentrances  to  the  visitation  areas  and  restrooms  for  both  visitors  and  wards  to  be  fully \naccessible as the highest barrier removal priority. \n \nPage 71 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.10 Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards' with Disabilities Access to Sanitation and Hygiene \n \nAccess to proper sanitation and hygiene for wards with disabilities is another issue that is related \nto  the  architectural  barrier  surveys  conducted  and  reports  prepared  by  a  separate  expert \nconsultant.  Toilet room and shower facilities are typically located at each living unit, and these \nare used on a rotating basis by wards on the unit.  There are other restrooms used by wards \nthroughout  the  various  facilities,  including  schools  and  work  areas.    As  evidenced  by  the \narchitectural surveys, the vast majority of these do not meet federal and state accessibility codes \nand standards.  The extent to which these non-complying facilities might be usable for an \nindividual ward would depend upon the individual disability of the ward.   \n \nAt toilet areas within the living units, the major barrier would be the consistent lack of grab bars \nat the rear and side of any toilet.  This is not intended to minimize the need for a higher than \nnormal toilet or additional maneuvering space around the toilet, but grab bars are essential for \ntransfer to the toilet, and the addition of grab bars for at least one toilet per restroom should be an \nimmediate priority, as such an addition is readily accomplished without much difficulty or \nexpense, and with no foreseeable security concerns.  \n \nWards typically shower and conduct other personal hygiene in shower rooms on the living units.  \nThe showers are similar to stall showers in that there are usually privacy dividers between \nshowers, with the dividers are usually being only about three or four feet high for security \nreasons.  Usage of these by a ward using a wheelchair or for others with mobility impairments \nwould be difficult if not impossible since there are no hand held shower heads or seats. \n \nAt O. H. Close YCF, a new accessible shower had been recently constructed in one of the living \nunits, although it was not yet in operation.  At a number of other institutions, senior staff \nmembers mentioned that accessible showers were planned, but I did not see any other showers \nthat had been in any way modified to be accessible to serve the wards with mobility impairments \nin the living units.  There were a number of accessible showers at specialized areas, such as at \nthe new outpatient clinic at El Paso de Robles YCF.  However, the overall problem is greater \nthan just providing one or two showers at each facility, which might seem to be a reasonable \nsolution.  The reality is that most facilities have different types of living units, and individualized \nprograms are physically associated with these living units (for example, gang relinquishment \nprograms, sex offender programs, new ward entry programs, etc.)  Providing an accessible \nbathroom and shower facilities at a few of these programs, or at a general population program \ndormitory alone, would limit the choices that wards with disabilities would have for correct \nplacement, and would therefore could be discriminatory in nature.  An easy solution for such a \nproblem is difficult to reach, because providing an accessible shower at every living unit within \nevery facility of the CYA would require a significant outlay of capital and resources at a time \nwhen  resources  and  funds  are  needed  for  a  wide  variety  of  programs  that  could  be  more \nbeneficial to a larger population of wards with disabilities, and the reality is that such an \nPage 72 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \naccessible shower might not be used by a ward with the disability.  Perhaps the most reasonable \nshort-term solution would be to construct one accessible shower at one of the general population \nliving units at each facility and to purchase a number of temporary shower conversion kits that \nare commercially available.  While such is not a reasonable long-term solution, it could help to \nprovide an efficient way to insure that wards with mobility impairments are placed at the most \nappropriate program location, not just the most advantageous physical location, and still have a \ndegree of access to proper hygiene at each facility.  However, for the long-term, there does not \nappear to be any alternative to providing accessible showers and other restroom facilities at such \ntime as other construction work or other improvements are also provided at each individual \nprogram location. \n \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Review the previous accessibility barrier surveys and prepare new surveys as required at the \nthree facilities not surveyed.  Prioritize sanitary facility improvements to provide program \naccess to each individual program. \n2.  Provide immediate temporary and easily achievable barrier solutions, such as grab bars at \ntoilet and portable accessible shower units, for at least one bathroom per living unit. \nPage 73 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.11  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards with Disabilities Access to Religious Services \n \nEach of the institutions visited had a building that served as the chapel for the facility.  Most had \ntwo sanctuaries, one for Protestant services and one for Catholic services. The only institution \nwithout such a chapel was the SYCRCC/Norwalk, which used a multi-use auditorium for all \nchurch services.  Native American services were typically held at sweat lodges which were \nlocated in more isolated parts of the facility away from other buildings.  Muslim and other \nreligious services were typically held at the chapels or various other locations throughout the \ninstitutions. \n \nThe architectural barrier surveys for five of the eight facilities that I visited describe the details of \nwhat types of non-complying items may be present at each chapel at each institution.  My own \nobservations indicated that the chapels were generally accessible at the primary entrance and \nwould allow wards with mobility impairments to enter the building.  The only exceptions were at \nPreston YCF, where a stairway provided the only entrance to the chapel, and SYCRCC/Norwalk, \nwhich had high door thresholds at the entrances.  None of the chapels visited had at any specific \nareas  within  the  sanctuary  for  integrated  seating  for  persons  using  wheelchair,  as  most \nsanctuaries had fixed pew seating. \n \nDuring several interviews that I had with wards who were deaf or hard of hearing, I asked if they \nattended religious services, and I received some input that interpreters were not provided to them \nfor these activities. \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Provide an accessible entrance, either by ramp or wheelchair lift, to the chapel at Preston YCF \nthat would allow a ward with a mobility impairment to enter the facility independently, as a \nfirst priority in accessibility upgrades at that facility. \n2.  Provide  a  new  level  door  threshold  at  one  entrance  to  the  multi-use  room  at \nSYCRCC/Norwalk that would allow a ward with a mobility impairment to enter the facility \nindependently, as a first priority in accessibility upgrades at that facility. \n3.  In each chapel, provide a level and open seating area that is integrated within the pews so that \nwards or visitors who use a wheelchair can sit with others who are attending the religious \nservice, as a first priority in accessibility upgrades at that facility. \n4.  At each institution, canvass the wards who are deaf or hard of hearing around mid-week to \nsee if any will be attending one of the religious services, so that an interpreter, assistive \nlistening device, or auxiliary aid can be made available to that ward, with plenty of time to \nplan the accommodation (see also Section 4.8 on wards' access to communications). \n \n \n \nPage 74 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.12 Specific Area of Inquiry- Wards with Disabilities Access to Emergency Services & Plans \n \nDuring 1999, the CYA prepared extensive emergency and evacuation plans in anticipation of \npotential Y2K problems.  These plans are recent and provide a very good general level of \nemergency policies and procedures at all institutions.  The only plan that I reviewed in detail for \nPreston YCF (perhaps the most difficult site from an emergency services standpoint) was an \nexample of the typical plan, but it is my understanding that all other plans for the other seven \ninstitutions are similar.  The plan I reviewed was thoughtfully prepared and appeared to cover \nmost of the issues and topics necessary for a comprehensive plan. \n \nHowever, the plan I reviewed did not have any specific instructions and procedures regarding \nwards with disabilities during emergencies, and in particular, for those wards who might have \nphysical disabilities.  According to the ADA and Section 504, this is an important component of \nemergency and evacuation plans, since wards with disabilities pose additional circumstances and \nissues during an emergency.  I would strongly recommend that the existing plans for each facility \nbe amended to include additional information on emergency policies and procedures for wards \nwith disabilities, including routes and methods of evacuation, security and containment concerns, \nadditional communication methods for assuring that wards with hearing disabilities are properly \nnotified of procedures that must occur, etc. \n \nStaff members who were interviewed indicated that they were thoroughly trained in evacuation \nprocedures.  Most common use and/or guard areas had emergency evacuation maps, but these \nwere often placed in inconspicuous locations.  None of the maps that I observed had information \nregarding evacuation routes or assistance procedures for wards with disabilities. \n \nThe basic procedures for releasing wards from individual living units, as well as lock-down \nunits, during emergencies was demonstrated to me.  The system involves the use of simultaneous \ndoor operating systems.  Reportedly, the systems have been upgraded in recent years and are \ntested on regular basis.  These systems appeared to be adequate for general purposes, but it is \nunclear if they provide the degree of appropriate evacuation necessary for wards with mobility \nimpairments. \n \nThe living units and school areas had audible fire alarm systems.  However, very few areas had \nvisual emergency alarms (also called strobe alarms) at any locations, as also described in the \narchitectural  barrier  surveys.    At  a  minimum,  such  alarms  should  be  provided,  even  on  a \ntemporary basis if necessary, within individual living units and other areas frequented by wards \nwho are deaf or hard of hearing. \nPage 75 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Update and amend the emergency services and evacuation plans and other written emergency \nprocedures  at  each  institution  to  include  specific  instructions  and  procedures  for  the \nemergency services for and evacuation of wards with disabilities. \n2.  Continue testing and certification of emergency door releasing apparatus at each living unit to \nassure proper operation. \n \n3. Install  preferably  permanent  visual  fire  alarms  (or  if  necessary  to  provide  immediate \ncoverage, temporary strobe lights may be necessary) at all individual living units housing \nwards who are deaf or hard of hearing.  Prioritize those other areas frequented by these wards \nto receive visual alarms as soon as possible. \n \n \n \nPage 76 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.13  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards with Disabilities Access to Food Service \n \nFood service to wards is provided in a number of different ways and varies from facility to \nfacility.    Heman  G.  Stark  YCF,  Preston  YCF,  DeWitt  Nelson  YCF,  Ventura  YCF, \nSYCRCC/Norwalk and El Paso de Robles YCF have central dining halls, while N.A. Chaderjian \nYCF and O.H. Close YCF, and have smaller separate dining halls serving each living unit. \n \nMeal service policies also vary from facility to facility and can also vary from time to time, \ndepending on population trends, degree of ward violence, and other factors.  At the present time, \nat Preston YCF, DeWitt Nelson YCF, O.H. Close YCF, Ventura YCF, SYCRCC/Norwalk and \nEl Paso de Robles YCF, breakfast and dinner are served in the dining halls and lunches are \ndelivered to wards in the living units.  At Heman G. Stark YCF and N.A. Chaderjian YCF, all \nmeals are served in the living units to wards in their rooms.  Generally, all meals are served to \nwards in their living units at temporary detention units, intensive treatment program units, and \nspecialized care units.  I found no evidence that wards with disabilities were provided food \nservice differently than other wards, although as discussed in Section 2, I encountered few wards \nwith mobility impairments in the general population units. \n \nThe architectural barrier surveys indicate to what extent the dining facilities at five of the eight \ninstitutions that I visited are in violation with federal and state accessibility codes and guidelines, \nand  therefore,  I  did  not  undertake  any  detailed  architectural  surveys  of  these  buildings.  \nHowever, I did conduct a general level of review at each dining hall and a general observation as \nto whether there were significant accessibility barrier barriers that would preclude usage of the \nhall by persons with mobility impairments, including those who might use a wheelchair.  I \nobserved that in general, most facilities would be usable to a large degree by persons with \nmobility impairments.  However, there were a number of details that would make such usage \ndifficult for those who use wheelchairs or for those who have manual dexterity impairments.  \n \nThe facility that would be the most problematic would be El Paso de Robles YCF.  In this case, \npaths to and from entrance and exit doors to the dining hall have steps that would preclude wards \nwho might need to use a wheelchair or other mobility device from entering the dining hall \nindependently.  There is an entrance at the side near the kitchen that is not fully accessible but \npotentially usable. However, the use of that door would require security personnel to take \nadditional steps every time the wards used the facility, and a ward with a disability would have to \nenter  and  exit  the  dining  hall  separately  from the  other  wards.    This  may  or  may  not  be \nacceptable from a security standpoint, and much of that would depend on the particular ward in \nquestion.  However, in the long term, such as segregated entry and exit would not be acceptable \nfrom a service delivery standpoint, and therefore, the entry and exit to this particularly dining \nhall should be made accessible at the earliest opportunity.  The dining halls also have tray slides \nor tray pickups that would be higher than accessibility codes allow, and these would make it \ndifficult for wards with mobility impairments to use the food pickup areas independently.  These \nPage 77 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nshould be modified as described in the architectural surveys as a second priority. \nMost dining areas had fixed stools at tables, for obvious reasons.  At least one, and preferably \n5%, of all seating locations should have the stools removed so that a ward using a wheelchair \ncould approach and effectively use the table. \n \nWhile my site visits did not focus directly on architectural barriers, this is one situation where the \narchitectural and programmatic access are relating in that if a ward cannot take part in the \nprogram in a manner substantially equal to that of other wards, it would not be an acceptable \npractice to have a ward eat meals at a location other than the dining hall if other wards in the \nsame program have the ability to use the dining hall together.  Such an exclusion to a ward with a \ndisability would indeed be a discriminatory and an unacceptable practice.   \n \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Review the previous accessibility barrier surveys and prepare new surveys as required at the \nthree facilities not surveyed.  Prioritize facility improvements to provide program access to \neach dining hall. \n2.  Provide an accessible entrance path, either by ramp or wheelchair lift, to the dining hall at El \nPaso de Robles YCF to allow a ward with a mobility impairment to enter the dining hall \nindependently, as a first priority in accessibility upgrades at that facility. \n3.  Provide immediate temporary and easily achievable barrier solutions, such as removing fixed \nstools and lowering tray slides, at each dining hall. \n \nPage 78 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.14  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards with Disabilities Access to Transportation \n \nThe CYA typically uses security vans to transport wards both between facilities and inside of \nfacilities.  In most cases, these are modified 9 to 12 passenger vans, and they do not have any \nspecial  equipment  for  the  transportation  of  wards  who  might  have  a  mobility  impairment, \nincluding those who might use a wheelchair.  There was some documentation contained in the \nprevious experts' reports that the CYA intended to work out a sharing agreement with the CDC \nto  utilize  one  or  more  wheelchair  accessible  vans  for  the  transportation  of  wards  between \nfacilities, if indeed such transportation was necessary.  We mentioned this to some of the senior \nstaff members during our site visits but could not receive any definitive confirmation that this \npolicy had yet had been put into place. \n \nFor  wards  who  might  use  a  wheelchair  or  have  other  mobility  impairments,  it  would  be \nimportant that they be able to be transported easily and efficiently with a van that uses a \nwheelchair lift.  It should be noted that it is not an acceptable practice under either Section 504 or \nthe ADA for others to have to physically lift a person in order for that person to gain access to \ntransportation or a facility, except under emergency conditions, and such a prohibition would \ncertainly apply to CYA wards.  Since accessible vans are readily available and do not entail \nsignificant costs over vans specially equipped for security concerns, I would recommend that the \nnext purchase of transportation equipment for wards include at least one van for the southern \narea and one van for the northern area, and possibly more, subject to a needs analysis by the \nCYA. \n \nAs mentioned above, some institutions have buildings laid out over a relatively wide area and \ntypically utilize vans or passenger vehicles for the transportation of wards within the facility.  \nThese facilities include Ventura YCF, Preston YCF, and potentially others.  In these instances, \nthe placement of wards with mobility impairments may be in part based upon the overall \naccessibility of the site.  This practice would tend to apply restrictive placement criteria upon \nwards with disabilities and should not be an acceptable practice.  In the short-term (prior to full \nsite accessibility, a condition that will be particularly difficult to achieve at Preston YCF), it \nwould also be necessary to provide a van equipped a wheelchair lift at the facility.   \n \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  In the next purchase of transportation equipment for wards, include at least one van for the \nsouthern area and one van for the northern area, and possibly more, subject to a needs \nanalysis by the CYA. \n \nPage 79 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n4.15  Specific Area of Inquiry - Wards with Disabilities Access to Other Programs \n \nThe CYA has many special programs that provide a variety of activities, as well as educational \nand vocational opportunities, for wards.  It would be too time-consuming and not necessarily \nproductive to list each individual program at all institutions.  Also, the program details, as well as \ntheir names, change from time to time.  The purpose of this section is to describe the types of \nprograms that exist and to evaluate how wards with disabilities are able to participate in these \nspecial programs. \n \nExamples are the fire pre-camp at Preston YCF; \"Free Venture\" vocational programs at Heman \nG. Stark YCF; specialized culinary arts and food service programs at Preston YCF (\"Feast\"), \nDeWitt Nelson YCF, O.H. Close YCF, and N.A. Chaderjian YCF (\"Delta Room\"), Heman G. \nStark YCF (\"Eatery\"), Ventura YCF (Culinary Arts); pet grooming and \"Soap Vision\" at Ventura \nYCF; and other on-site work programs.  DeWitt Nelson YCF has had a variety of off-site work \nprograms for a number of years, but these had been cut back to only a few during my site visits \nand have since been suspended. \n \nAs a summary, it is my opinion that wards with disabilities have a degree of access to the vast \nmajority of these special programs offered within the CYA.  However, advancement within these \nprograms or the ability to enjoy the full benefits of these programs are commonly reduced \nbecause of either (1) eligibility criteria that in some cases screen out wards with disabilities, or \n(2) because of the lack of the program modifications for wards with disabilities.  Of all the wards \nwith physical disabilities that I interviewed, I believe that only two had been involved in what \nmight best be termed a special program - that is, one which wards deemed to be a popular \nprogram and one that has either monetary or opportunistic value for the ward. \n \nEligibility criteria for special programs vary greatly from program to program.  I was able to \nreview only a sampling of the criteria for selected programs.  But even this degree of review \nraised questions about whether criteria intended to provide safety and reliability for program \nparticipants actually excluded those who would have a legitimate ability to do the job.  For \nexample, the \"Fire Camp Criteria\" document requires no use of psychotropic drugs for at least 4 \nmonths.  There is no definition of psychotropic drugs, and a participant might use a certain drug \nfor a number of unknown reasons that may be related to that person's disability, with no real \ndanger to the person or anyone else. \n \nFor wards with physical disabilities, including mobility impairments, visual impairments, or for \nwards who are deaf or hard of hearing, the majority of wards interviewed or evaluated indicated \nsome  degree  of  inflexibility  or  some  barrier  which  preempted  those  wards  from  fully \nparticipating in special programs.  Sometimes it was basically a lack of accommodation, and \nother  times  it  was  inflexibility  on  the  part  of  the  program  administrator  to  make  other \narrangements that could have been simple and readily achievable. \nPage 80 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n \nIn order to illustrate these points, I will give a few examples below.  It should be noted that the \nactual names, institutions, programs, and other details are omitted because of my promise of \nconfidentiality  to  the  wards  I  interviewed.    I  also  believe  I  used  reasonable  judgment  in \ndiscerning which wards were giving truthful accounts of things that occurred.  I certainly cannot \nguarantee absolute accuracy of all of the circumstances discussed below, but I can say that I have \nnot included those occurrences where I have some questions as to their validity. \n \nOne ward with long-term injury to the lower back and associated mobility impairments was \nindeed admitted to a program that involved dexterity with animals.  While the need for mobility \nwould indeed be an advantage in effectively completing the necessary tasks, that particular \nability was certainly not mandatory for the ward to carry out the tasks essential to the overall \noperation of the program.  The ward requested on several occasions to be allowed to sit and take \npart  in  activities  where  mobility  would  not  be  necessary,  but  was  generally  denied  that \naccommodation because it was deemed necessary that the ward be able to move about.  The \nissue for this ward was not one relating to movement but rather to fatigue, and at some point, the \nward became too fatigued and stress on the legs was too much for the ward to continue.  \n \nAnother ward who was hard of hearing expressed a specific concern to me about taking part in a \nvery popular \"free venture\" program.  I made some inquiries as to why the ward could not have \nbeen admitted into that program.  While the reason was never specifically given that the ward \nwould have difficulty communicating, I surmised that that might have been a possible reason.  \nThat particular program involved an outside contractor whose criteria for selection, while not \nparticularly excluding someone who was hard of hearing, was nevertheless restrictive and in \nsome ways could tend to exclude such a ward.  \n \nAnother ward who was hard of hearing was part of a grounds-keeping crew but was told that he \ncould not use power tools as part of his activities.  It was not fully documented as to why such \nwould be a problem, although the rationale was most likely that the ward might not be able to \nhear or sense others around him during the use of the equipment.  If this was the rationale, it \nrelied more on the actions others rather than those of the particular ward.  If the ward's own \nsafety was the issue, there are accommodations (for example, using a power tool with a light that \ncomes  on  when  the  machinery  is  that  operation)  that  would  allow  the  ward  to  utilize  the \nequipment.  I cannot state definitively that this activity with power tools could or should be \nallowed under the ADA for this particular ward, and it could very well be that there are other \ncontributing factors of which I am not aware.  Also, in some ways, the program should possibly \nbe commended for not totally excluding the ward from the program, an action that is far too \ncommon with other public agencies and even private businesses.  The point to be made is that \nprogram coordinators should objectively evaluate each ward's unique disability and situation, \nand detailed criteria should not be created arbitrarily or capriciously.  \n \nPage 81 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nMany  of  the  issues  with  special  programs  involve  activities  that  are  similar  to  the  work \nenvironment in the everyday workplace.  Therefore, it seems appropriate to apply some of the \nsame standards and conditions of employment to these activities.  These standards are detailed, \nand it would not be within the scope of this inquiry to describe all of the employment-related \nstandards contained in Title I of the ADA.  However, in general, when evaluating a particular job \nand task, one must evaluate the essential functions of the job and determine if a person with a \ndisability can indeed perform those essential tasks, with accommodations if necessary.  The \nexclusion of a person with the disability from a particular job or task simply because they may \nnot be perceived as able to perform secondary functions should not preclude a person with a \ndisability from being allowed to participating in those tasks. \n \nIt should be noted that I cannot accurately evaluate to what extent, if any, wards with mental, \nemotional, and developmental disabilities are excluded from special programs.  It is probable \nthat in a selection process there could be discrimination based upon factors related to disability, \nbut I did not find any specific evidence of such. \n \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  For each special program or activity, evaluate eligibility criteria to assure that wards with \ndisabilities are not excluded when they can perform the essential functions of the activity. \n2.  Provide reasonable accommodations or modifications to wards with disabilities if needed to \nparticipate in special programs and activities. \n \n \n \nPage 82 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n5.1  Specific Area of Inquiry - Appropriate Training for Staff \n \nThe actual wording for this specific area of inquiry is as follows:  On a system-wide level, is \nthere appropriate training to ensure that staff will follow the policies and procedures designed to \nensure that wards with disabilities are: (1) provided with access to the above programs and \nservices, and (2) not subject to harassment or discrimination related to their disabilities? \n \nThe CYA provides training to staff in a number of ways.  The major training component is \ncontained within the programs of the CYA Training Academy, located at the Northern California \nYouth Correctional Center at Stockton.  As listed in Section 2, I visited that facility for only a \nshort period of time during my site visits.  However, my evaluation of CYA training programs \nextends beyond just that site visit and includes both an evaluation of the training policies and \nprocedures  contained  in  the  various  documents  provided  to  me  and  an  evaluation  of  the \ninterviews and observations of a wide variety of staff functions at the eight institutions I visited.  \nTraining in its broadest context also includes numerous in-service seminars and meetings on \nvarious topics within the institutions and is not limited to just activities within the Training \nAcademy. \n \nDuring my visit to the Training Academy, we discussed the fact that changes in training are \nplanned.    These  generally  involve  combining  the  training  resources  within  the  Youth  and \nCorrectional Agency to coordinate and integrate training for both the California Department of \nCorrections (CDC) and the CYA.  I do not know the details of any proposed consolidation, nor if \nsuch is actually planned or is being implemented.  My evaluation includes only those areas \nspecific  to  the  CYA,  and  it  is  possible  that  some  procedures  and  curricula  are  subject  to \nimmediate or future change.  I would not begin to comment on any proposed organizational \nchanges of training components within the Youth and Correctional Agency, as such is beyond \nthe scope of this inquiry.  However, for this purposes of this inquiry, I would express some \ncaution that the ADA, Section 504, and IDEA treat minors and students very differently from \nadults, and I would hope any consolidation of training would keep these disability requirements \nseparate and distinct. \n \nThe Training Academy is an impressive, state-of-the-art facility that includes areas for new cadet \nand in-service training activities, staff development, and curriculum development.  The programs \nare highly organized and efficiently managed by a dedicated and competent staff.  There are over \n90 separate basic academy courses, each with a highly developed curriculum.  Of these courses, \na number appear to contain elements related to the ADA and disability policy and procedures, as \nit is a topic that has applications in many areas.  Of the course list provided to me, no courses are \nspecifically  limited  to  ADA  or  disability  policy.    There  is  a  course  on  IEP's,  and  it  was \ncommunicated to me that the ADA was most recently taught as part of a course entitled \"Illness \nand Prevention Training.\"  There is a part of Supervisor's Training on the ADA, and I was \nprovided with the text entitled \"Americans with Disabilities.\"  There could easily be other \ncourses that have been offered on the ADA and disability policy with which I am unaware. \nPage 83 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n(a)  Working with Wards with Disabilities \n \nMy first opinion about these training courses and curricula is that there needs to be a distinct and \nseparate course for both new cadets and existing staff (not just supervisors) on the ADA and \ngeneral disability policy that specifically relates to the rights and treatment of wards (as opposed \nto employees).  As stated above, this may be planned or may have occurred in the past, but I do \nnot  have  any  specific  details  of  such.    This  opinion  is  primarily  based  upon  my  constant \ninteraction  and  observations  with  staff  for  the  almost  100  hours  I  spent  within  the  eight \ninstitutions.  I observed a marked degree of misconceptions and erroneous beliefs about the \nnature of disability, as well as a general lack of knowledge of what the ADA and other disability \nlaws  and  regulations  require.    While  \"independence\"  within  the  correctional  context  is  a \ncomplicated issue, many staff did not show an awareness of issues related to this concept.  It is \ntrue that these disability-related topics will have application to many other areas of training, and \na fundamental knowledge of the ADA and acceptable disability policy will apply itself to all of \nthose unique conditions that arise in the process of working with wards with disabilities. \n \nThe text for the Supervisors Training entitled \"Americans with Disabilities\" is actually tailored \nalmost exclusively for employees with disabilities, not wards.  While some of the information \ncould have application to wards, it is basically an \"equal opportunity\" manual, and it is primarily \nbased on Title I of the ADA (Employment Provisions) and not on Title II of the ADA (Programs \nand Services of State and Local Governments).  It is not within my scope of work to evaluate \nequal opportunity employee programs, so I did not review the material in detail to determine if it \nis appropriate, although it appears to be potentially acceptable for this use.  However, it does not \nadequately address wards' disability rights nor effective policies and procedures for working with \nwards with disabilities, and it should not be used for this purpose. \n \nThe Instructor Guide for \"Individualized Education Process (should be Plan)\" used as part of the \nPeace Officer Training is generally a comprehensive (76 pages) and well-prepared document that \nis authoritative and very usable (although this is not intended to be a total endorsement of all \ninformation contained in it).  It is interesting to note that this document appears to have been \nprepared, at least in part, in response to CDE's monitoring of special education and the litigation \nNick O. v. Terhune and Tillson during 1989-90.  During the 1990's, the CYA undertook a \nconcerted effort to not only improve special education, but also to educate all staff on IDEA and \nState special education requirements.  This course and guide appear to be one offshoot of that \neffort.  As was discussed in Section 4.6, while I had some reservations about the tenor and \ncontent of IEP meetings, I did feel that CYA staff as a whole was cognizant of IEP's and special \neducation, including those who were not necessarily directly involved in education.  This points \nup the fact that training can be an effective tool in helping to bring about awareness and \ncompliance agency-wide. \n \nPage 84 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nThe Instructor Guide for \"Special Treatment Needs\" used as part of the Peace Officer Training \nhas some content related to wards with disabilities, but it is not unique to this topic, and includes \nsex offender treatment and purely behavioral issues intermixed with disability-related treatment \nneeds.  Apparently, the guide that I was provided does not represent all that is actually offered in \nthe course, as it is only 10 pages long and the overall guide appears to be at least 125 pages.  I \ncan only assume that what was provided to me is the portion that relates specifically to the ADA \nand disability.  This portion of the guide has a number of mis-statements, has no tenor of the \nindependence afforded by the ADA, and is cursory at best.  It makes no attempt to provide \ninsight into the nature of disability or the purposes and philosophies behind the ADA and other \ndisability regulations.  This document should not be utilized in the context of effective training \non the ADA for wards with disabilities.  Again, it is probable that there are additional materials, \neither Power Point presentations or other aids, that are used with this curriculum, but based on \nthe limited amount I was provided, I would be cautious about the content of this material. \n \nBased to a limited degree upon the training documents I reviewed (which were admittedly \nlimited), but primarily upon my interactions with staff during my site visits, I would strongly \nrecommend that the CYA Training Academy undertake an immediate and comprehensive course \ndevelopment effort for basic ADA and disability policy and regulations training for all staff, \nincluding correctional officers, teachers, treatment team members, and even office personnel on \nthe topic of working with wards with disabilities.  This training should be provided to new cadets \nas well as current staff.  Because these requirements are highly specialized, and because attitudes \nare actually more important on a practical level than simple compliance, I would strongly \nrecommend  that  these  curricula  and  course  materials  be  prepared  by  an  outside  consultant \nspecializing in such training.  A less desirable alternative might be that the curricula could be \ndeveloped by CYA staff, but reviewed and edited by an accepted disability rights organization \nprior to implementation. \n \n(b)  Disability Awareness  \n \nAs stated above, it is my opinion that a basic awareness and understanding of the philosophical \nrationale behind modern disability policy and regulations is less than it should be within the \nCYA.  This manifested itself at various levels during my site visits.   \n \nFor example, while the use of proper and generally accepted disability \"terminology\" is not \nwithin itself an accurate representation of attitudes, it can be a reflection of the extent to which \nstaff is trained in disability issues.  The use of inappropriate terms and categorizations by various \nstaff members was not uncommon during my site visits.  While we all slip and occasionally use \nan improper term in casual conversation, I found such lapses to be an indication of the need to \nfocus on attitudes and some of the more subjective aspects of disability awareness. \n \nPage 85 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nAnother more specific example, and one that may be also be highly subjective in nature, relates \nto  a  typical  \"accommodation\"  for  wards  who  are hard of hearing.  Often, such wards are \naccommodated by being placed in a front row of a classroom, or by being read instructions in a \nlouder voice or another individualized manner.  In certain situations, such accommodations may \nbe appropriate and necessary.  However, in general, requiring a ward to always sit next to a \nteacher or receive communication in a separate manner can, and over the long term definitely \nwill, cause such a ward to be isolated and segregated.  Within reason, all wards have a basic right \nto sit with peers and to generally be treated in a similar manner as other wards.  This is where \nawareness and an understanding of the particular ward's needs, as well as the related disability, is \nimportant. \n \nAs  part  of  the  staff  training  for  working  with  wards  with  disabilities  as  recommended  in \nsubsection (a) above, such training should include a major component to teach awareness and \nsensitivity. \n \n(c)  Harassment by Staff \n \nI attempted to evaluate if harassment of wards with disabilities existed in two ways.  First, I \nroutinely asked the wards I interviewed if harassment had been directed toward them by staff.  \nSecond, I consciously observed staff interactions with all wards and occasionally asked staff \nabout their dealings with wards.  It should be noted that my intent in this particular scope of \ninquiry was limited to potential staff harassment based upon the disability of a ward, and it did \nnot  include  potential  harassment  based  on  other  factors,  such  as  ethnicity,  gender,  gang \naffiliation, etc. \n \nWards generally indicated that they felt no pattern of harassment by staff based upon their \ndisabilities.  It should be noted that despite my statement of confidentiality to wards, I suspect \nthat many would have been hesitant to go too far with this subject, since understandably, they did \nnot  have  complete  trust  in  my  objectives.    However,  I  used  what  I  felt  were  reasonable \ntechniques to evoke honest responses and feel that, in general, that is what I received.  I did \nreceive a very few isolated responses that a degree of harassment by staff might occurred on a \noccasion.  While this is not justifiable or acceptable, it is nevertheless foreseeable to a certain \ndegree.  However, my general opinion is that there is not a significant degree of intentional and \nmalicious harassment by staff toward wards with disabilities and that there is no definitive \npattern of such harassment.  My observations and interviews with staff also did not indicate that \nsuch harassment was pattern behavior by staff. \n \nThe degree with which discrimination by individual staff against wards with disabilities has \noccurred is far more subjective.  This entire report has contained a number of examples of \npolices, procedures, and conditions that affect the treatment of wards with disabilities and of \nsituations involving individual staff member's habits and attitudes in working with wards with \nPage 86 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \ndisabilities.  In most of these cases, I do not believe I have the all of the facts or wherewithal to \nlabels these policies and actions as \"discriminatory\", and I will have to let the reader make that \ndetermination based upon the information presented.  I believe that in the vast majority of the \ncases  where  discrimination  by  individual  staff  members  might  have  occurred,  such \ndiscrimination was based on misconceptions, inadequate training, or for lack of a better word, \nignorance.  I do not believe (again, for the vast majority of cases) that potential discrimination \nwas based on a conscious efforts to discriminate by individual staff members. \n \nNevertheless, in response to those isolated cases where harassment or intentional discrimination \nmight have occurred, I would recommend that the staff training described in subsection (a) above \ninclude a component that discusses potential harassment of wards with disabilities, and that it \ninclude examples of potential staff actions that might be termed harassment and provide alternate \nprocedures for staff to follow. \n \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n1.  Institute a distinct and separate training course and curricula at the Training Academy for \nboth new cadets and existing staff (not just supervisors) on the ADA and general disability \npolicy  that  specifically  relates  to  the  rights  and  treatment  of  wards  (as  opposed  to \nemployees). \n2.  As part of the staff training for working with wards with disabilities as recommended above, \ninclude a major component to teach awareness and sensitivity. \n3.  As part of the staff training for working with wards with disabilities as recommended above, \ninclude a component that discusses potential harassment of wards with disabilities, and \ninclude examples of potential staff actions that might be termed harassment and provide \nalternate procedures for staff to follow. \nPage 87 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n5.2  Specific Area of Inquiry - Appropriate Training for Wards \n \nThis specific area of inquiry is worded as follows:  On a system-wide level, is there appropriate \ntraining to ensure that wards will follow the policies and procedures designed to ensure that \nwards with disabilities are (1) provided with access to the above programs and services and (2) \nnot subject to harassment or discrimination related to their disabilities? \n \nAt the outset of the entire project, the topic of wards' own involvement in respecting the rights of \nother wards with disabilities, and not subjecting fellow wards with disabilities to harassment and \ndiscrimination, was one of the most intriguing aspects of my scope of inquiry.  I tried to enter all \nof the various scopes of inquiry with no preconceived ideas about what I might find, but \nknowledge I have gained from other similar projects is something that I cannot preclude.  And \nunfortunately,  it  has  been  my  experience  that  at  many  school  districts  for  which  I  have \nundertaken disability evaluations, students, particularly those in the teen-age years, can indeed \ninflict significant harassment upon other students with disabilities.  Therefore, this was one of the \nareas in which I had serious initial concerns. \n \nWhat I actually observed was the most surprising aspect to me of all of my evaluations.  In \ngeneral, I found an indefinable, and almost innate, universal empathy among all wards, both with \nand without disabilities, toward other wards with disabilities.  The word \"empathy\" should not be \nconfused with \"sympathy\", because wards appeared to possess a realistic awareness of how \ndisabilities affect daily life, and these realizations were more \"matter-of-fact\" than internalized. \n \nI undertook some degree of analysis as to why this condition existed, but came to realize that a \ncomplete analysis of this phenomenon would be too esoteric and complicated.  Probably the \nmain reason lies in the simple saying that wards \"are all in the same boat\".  Despite the best \nefforts of any correctional staff, wards still basically see their condition as an \"us versus them\" \nsituation.  Another reason probably lies in the fact that so many wards come from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds and understand the pressures of overcoming barriers.  Another probable reason is \nthat wards experience the \"daily grind\" of incarceration, since most have been in County lock-\nups for extended periods of time before entering the CYA, and many see their daily life from a \none-day-at-a-time perspective.  Therefore, they know first-hand what effects their own personal, \nindividual conditions, including possible disabilities, have on their progress through the system.  \nThere were a number of instances where a ward, when finding out the purpose of my visit, would \ntell me, \"Oh, Joe (referring to another ward) needs a new hearing aid…\" or \"Joe doesn't like his \nmeds…\", and so on. \n \nOne might expect that gang activity would negatively affect this aspect regarding the rights of \nwards with disabilities.  Certainly ward harassment based on gang affiliations, together with its \nfrequent manifestations of violence and hatred, is prevalent.  And wards with disabilities are \ncertainly as susceptible to gang-related harassment and violence as any ward.  However, upon \nPage 88 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nexamination, harassment appeared to almost always be the result of gang or ethnic differences \nand not disability.  I asked one ward who had been involved gang-related violence on numerous \noccasions if others used his obvious disability as an object of violence, and he said, \"Nah, they \nwouldn't do that\", implying that victimizing one's disability was \"out of bounds\" (where few \nother  things  were).    Another  interesting  phenomenon  that  was  described  to  me  by  a  staff \nmember, and that I also observed, is that two wards whose gangs were the most hated rivals, \nwhen removed from those gangs and the related peer pressure, would often individually establish \nan strange sense of camaraderie. \n \nI was also expecting peer pressure to have a major negative impact on outward manifestations of \na ward's disability, for example, the wearing of a hearing aid or glasses, picking up medications, \netc.  However, while certainly some wards might be self-conscious or embarrassed over these \nthings, I did not find that it was a significant issue with wards.  For several wards about whom \nstaff reported that they would not wear their hearing aids or glasses as they should, I found the \nmore likely reason to be that they were not the most appropriate accommodation, as discussed in \nSections 4.2 and 4.8. \n \nTo summarize, I feel that all wards are in need of orientation (as opposed to training) on the \nADA, IDEA, and disability policies and procedures within the CYA, as discussed in Section 4.1.  \nAnd  adding  a  component  that  addresses  awareness  and  discourages  harassment  and \ndiscrimination is also advisable.  However, the main objective to this orientation should be \ninformational and to assure that wards with disabilities understand their rights under federal and \nstate laws and regulations.  For several public school districts in my other projects, I have \nrecommended that an annual \"Disability Awareness Day\" be instituted.  I would stop short of \nrecommending such an activity for the CYA, although I would certainly have no objections to \nthat degree of awareness training as long as the activities and curricula were carefully planned.  \nSince conditions at the various institutions can change rapidly, I would recommend that both the \nfacility and agency-wide programmatic ADA Coordinators monitor conditions that could lead to \npotential harassment and discrimination of wards with disabilities. \n \n \nRecommended Policies and Procedures \n \n \n1.  Expand the wards' orientation at the intake centers to include specific information about the \nADA,  IDEA,  and  wards'  with  disabilities  rights,  as  well  as  programs  for  wards  with \ndisabilities within the CYA (see also Section 4.1).  Include information about disability \nawareness and the need to eliminate any harassment. \n \nPage 89 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \n6.  Specific Area of Inquiry - Do disabled wards have a reduced ability to reach a higher \nprogram phase or parole? \n \nBefore this question can be answered, it is important to fully understand the terms \"higher \nprogram phase\" and \"parole\".  Since these two terms actually represent two distinct processes \nwithin the CYA, they would best be discussed separately. \n \n(a) Higher Program Phase: \n \nThis term can actually have two different connotations within the context of programs within the \nCYA. \n \nA less rigid definition would refer to the general level of programs provided to all wards.  There \nare many programs within the CYA, and most individual programs are actually available to a \nsmall minority of wards.  Examples are sex offender programs, free venture programs, fire \nprevention training program, etc.  While it would be ideal for all wards to have full access to and \nparticipate in all available programs, practical allocations of resources make such a situation \nimpossible.  Furthermore, a ward's general behavior, tendency toward aggression or violent \nbehavior, success in past programs, and sometimes even the committing offense all play a role in \ndetermining what programs are made available to a specific ward. \n \nSome programs are by nature more advanced than others.  By \"more advanced\", it is not implied \nthat these programs are for wards who have greater intellectual potential or excel in academics.  \nIt is meant to refer to a general practice that those wards who have demonstrated success in a \nwide range of activities generally are more able to move on to more popular and more intensive \nprograms.  Reaching this ability to participate in the more advanced programs represents what \ncould be termed a \"higher program phase\". \n \nThere are a number of criteria that determine whether or not a ward can reach this level of \nparticipation.  The most critical factor is behavior, or in reality, the lack of Level 2, and 3 DDMS \nviolations, as described in Section 4.4.  Some programs have specific criteria for the number of \nDDMS  violations  a  ward  may  have  received;  others  are  more  subjective.    For  the  more \nsubjective programs, a decrease in DDMS violations, or an improvement in staff's perception of \ngeneral behavior, helps a ward meet the criteria.  There are various other criteria that can affect a \nward's ability to reach a higher program phase, including completion of a high school diploma or \nG.E.D., number of units completed, past program success, etc.  Likewise, these vary from \nprogram to program, and some have definitive educational or past work experience requirements. \n \nPage 90 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nA more literal definition would relate to the \"phase\" system utilized at the majority of living \nunits,  including  specialized  and  separated  (having  limited  or  no  contact  with  other  wards) \ntreatment programs.  The phase system usually places wards in phases 1, 2, or 3, although some \ninstitutions use a letter system.  The highest phase wards have access to special privileges and \n\"perks\".  For example, general population wards at O. H. Close YCF have access to private \nrooms, where other wards live in a dormitory setting (although there are usually more highest \nphase wards than available private rooms). \n \nFor these two somewhat related ways to define and understand program \"phases\", the question of \nwhether or not wards with disabilities have a reduced ability to reach higher phases comes down \nto whether or not wards with disabilities are treated equally to other wards under the daily \noperations of the CYA.  Generally, there are no specific guidelines or any written documentation \nthat wards with specific disabilities are not allowed to participate in higher phase programs or \nreach the highest phase designations at their living units.  (There may be a few exceptions to this \nstatement that involve eligibility requirements for special programs, as discussed in Section \n4.15.)   \n \nAn evaluation of a ward's with a disability access to higher phases is often individual.  For \nexample, one ward with a mobility impairment whom I interviewed and whose activities I \nreviewed in detail, had been able to participate in two unique special programs, had reached and \nstayed at the highest phase at the living unit, and had no serious DDMS violations; unless \nconditions  changed  drastically,  this  ward  would  almost  certainly  parole  on  the  parole \nconsideration date.  Another ward with a mobility impairment had been in intensive treatment \nprograms, had been extremely disruptive and violent with numerous level 3 DDMS violations \n(whether or not these behaviors were related to the disability was something that I could not \nascertain), to the best of my knowledge had never been in an advanced program, and would \nlikely have a hard time at the parole hearing.  These are probably the two extremes. \n \nAs opposed to the two examples above, I believe that the \"average\" (non-existent) ward with a \ndisability, throughout the term of the confinement, would most likely be to subject to one or \nmore  of  the  situations  described  in  detail  in  Sections  4.1  through  4.15.    It  may  be  an \naccommodation that really does not appropriately solve a disability-related communication issue.  \nIt  may  be  a  youth  correctional  officer  at  a  special  management  program  who  verbally \ncommunicates instructions to the group and does not realize that a hard of hearing ward is not \nfollowing those instructions - and a Level 2 write-up may follow.  The reality is that some wards \nwith disabilities will individually find these situations no different than their other daily events, \nand for these wards, the ability to reach higher phases will not be reduced.  But for more \nvulnerable wards, particularly those with less ability to communicate effectively what issues they \nhave difficulty in overcoming, the types of conditions described previously can indeed greatly \nreduce their ability to reach higher program phases. \n \nPage 91 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nThe only recommendations I would offer to solve any potential problems of reaching higher \nprogram phases would be to implement the recommendations contained in Sections 4.1 through \n4.15 and 5.1.  All of these issues can have a critical cumulative impact on a ward's with a \ndisability ability to advance through the system to thee higher program phases. \n \n(b)  Parole \n \nIn discussing wards with disabilities ability to reach parole, one must differentiate between two \nseparate but related processes.  The first process basically involves getting before the parole \nboard.  The second process involves the Parole Board's granting of parole. \n \nFor the first process, a ward's ability to reach parole is similar to the discussion in subsection (a).  \nIn fact, getting to parole is really the ultimate \"program phase\".  Certainly, there are conditions \nall along the way where a ward's progress toward parole can be derailed, in large part to actions \nthat would have nothing to do with a ward's disability, but in some cases, these could be related \nto a ward's disability.  Since an institutional parole agent acts, in some ways, as the ward's \nadvocate in obtaining parole, a ward should have a greater chance of the parole agent reviewing \nthe conditions surrounding any problems a ward with a disability has had in reaching parole.  \nThis is another reason why proper training on disability-related topics is critical for institutional \nparole agents. \n \nA ward can have time added to the board consideration date for various violations.  These are \ndetermined by the Youth Authority Advisory Committee (YAAC) at each institution, and upheld \nby the Parole Board if appealed.  I attended a number of YAAC hearings and did not perceive \nany biases or procedures that would specifically reduce the ability of wards with disabilities to \nreceive a full and fair hearing.  On the other hand, I also do not recall any specific inquiries into a \nward's disability at the hearing, or if that disability had any effect on the alleged violations that \ncaused the ward to appear at the hearing to add time before a parole consideration date.  The \npoint to be made here is that if indeed a ward with a disability has a reduced ability to reach a \nparole  consideration  date,  that  reduced  ability  would  have  most  likely  been  the  result  of \nconditions or events that occurred far in advance of the actual hearing, possibly even years \nbefore. \n \nFor the second process, I have discussed Parole Board hearings previously in Section 4.1(d), and \nI do not believe that Parole Board hearings, within themselves, constitute any reduced ability for \nwards with disabilities to receive parole. \nPage 92 \n\nAccess to Programs and Services for Wards with Disabilities  \nin the California Youth Authority \nConclusion \n \n \nIn closing, I would again like to thank everyone who was so cordial and helpful during my site \nvisits. \n \nI would also like to acknowledge the cooperative spirit that the CYA has demonstrated in \naddressing issues and making recent improvements in a number of program areas, including a \nnumber of areas discussed during my site visits.  I sincerely hope that the CYA will take all of \nthe opinions and recommendations included in this report in the positive manner in which they \nare offered, with the objective being to reach that goal to which it is believed all parties aspire - \nfull access to the programs and services within the CYA for wards with disabilities. \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n           \n \nLogan Hopper \nPage 93 ",

      "title": "Press Release on Reform of California Youth Authority",
      "text": "PRISON LAW OFFICE (cid:150)January 31, 2005 \nPRESS RELEASE ON REFORM OF CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY \n \nThe California Youth Authority (CYA) and the Prison Law Office today reached a \nhistoric agreement on a schedule to put the juvenile justice system in this state on the \nroad to reform by the end of this year and create a system that is rehabilitative and \nprovides a therapeutic environment for the juvenile offenders committed by the courts. \n \nBoth parties agreed that because the CYA (cid:147)has committed to transforming California(cid:146)s \njuvenile system(cid:148) and the Remedial Plans are dependent on that new system they cannot \nbe submitted by the deadline set forth in the Consent Degree. \n \nUnder the conditions of the agreement, (see the attached document) the CYA agrees to \nmeet  several  specific  deadlines  for  delivering  various  remedial  plans  to  the  court \nbeginning on February 4 and concluding November 30 of this year.  The plans will \naddress several areas including medical care, educational services, mental health care, \ndisability services, sex offender treatment, and ward safety and welfare (formerly General \nCorrections). \n \n(cid:147)With this historic agreement we are moving California(cid:146)s juvenile justice system forward \nto better serve the people of this state by making our institutions better and safer and \nultimately our communities and neighborhoods safer,(cid:148) said Walt Allen, Director of the \nCYA. \n \n(cid:147)We(cid:146)re thrilled to be part of this exciting move forward as we work to develop a system \nthat provide the treatment and rehabilitation the juvenile offenders need and which makes \nall of us safer,(cid:148) said Sara Norman, staff attorney for the Prison Law Office. \n \nIn  addition  to  providing  the  remedial  plans  to  the  court,  the  CYA  also  agrees  to \nimplement several immediate changes in its operations including implementing an (cid:147)open \nprogramming model(cid:148) at N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility and at Heman G. \nStark Youth Correctional Facility by March 1 with full implementation of the plan by \nJune 1.  This plan will (cid:147)restore safe general population programming to ensure that wards \nare out of their rooms/cells daily for educational, vocational, and treatment programming \nas well as meals and recreation.(cid:148) This open programming model will be extended to all \nother institutions by May 2. \n \nSeveral other changes are also outlined in the court agreement including modifying the \ndepartment(cid:146)s lockdown protocols, provision of services to wards in Special Management \nPrograms, elimination of temporary detention as punishment for behavior.  \n \nWith the approval of the plaintiff(cid:146)s attorneys, the Department will also hire an expert \nconsultant in the area of custodial treatment of juvenile offenders.  This expert along with \nthe Special Master, the plaintiff(cid:146)s attorneys and the department will lead process for \nchanging the California Youth Authority into the rehabilitative model all parties are \nworking to create. \n\n ",

      "title": "Evaluation of Sex Offender Programs - The California Youth Authority",
      "text": "JERRY  THOMAS  CONSULTING  AND  TRAINING \n1799  LINDEN  AVENUE \nMEMPIS,  TENNESSEE  38104 \n901-276-5741 \nEVALUATION OF SEX OFFENDER PROGRAMS \nTHE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY \nSEPTEMBER 29, 2003 \n\nJERRY THOMAS CONSULTING AND TRAINING \n1799 LINDEN AVENUE \nMEMPHIS, TENNESSEE 38104 \n901-276-5741 \nFINAL REPORT \nEVALUATION OF SEX OFFENDER PROGRAMS \nTHE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY \nSEPTEMBER 29, 2003 \nThis report is the result of an intensive evaluation of the California Youth Authority's sex \noffender treatment programs and is written to provide answers to the fonowing six areas \nof inquiry: \n1.  Does the CYA   offer adequate sex offender treatment to all the wards committed \nto the CYA   by a juvenile court for sexual offenses? \n2.  Have the CYA staff that work with or have contact with sexually offending wards \nreceived appropriate training? \n3.  Does the CYAhave an adequate level of staff to implement its sex offender \ntreatment progr~? \n4.  Does the CYA   have appropriate policies concerning the provision of sex offender \ntreatment? \n5.  Thoughts and recommendations on the CYA  's transition from a program model to \na case management model - Vision and Implementation. \n6.  Thoughts and recommendations on the CYA's Sex Offender Treatment Work \nGroup \nIn addition to answering these six questions, I was asked that any recommendations be \nrealistic and practical.  My years of experience with social service, correctional, and non \nprofit organizations has served to make me very familiar with these kinds of guidelines. \n\nToo often this mandate actually means to fix the problems without additional funds.  In \nthis case I  am operating under the assumption that in this case I am being asked to \nrecommend the minimum changes necessary to deliver a safe and adequate program. \nAdequate simply meaning  a program that is supported by standards of practice and \nguidelines such as those developed by the National Standards on Sex Offense Specific \nPrograms for Adolescents, The National Task Force Report, the Standards developed by \nthe Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, studies and reports from the Center \nfor Sex Offender Management,  the vast amount of literature on how to provide \nsuccessful programs for these youth, and the research to date on assessment, treatment, \nand risk management. I have attempted to do just that, and if the amount of change \nrequired seems large, ~t is due to the size of the problems. \nI have attempted to show in the cost analysis section  it why it is realistic and practical to \ndevelop and implement a program for all of the juvenile sexual offenders in the \nCalifornia Youth Authority that will have the optimal chance of being successful  in \ndecreasing sexually abusive behavior. Doing anything less than this is a mistake both \nfinancially and in terms of human suffering.  There is no doubt that programs need to be \ndeveloped and implemented in as cost effective and efficient a way as possible. \nRealistically, though, creating a program for approximately 1200 sexually abusive wards \nthat will meet nationally recognized standards of care is going to require funding.  These \nfunds, however, are a good investment, and one with almost immediate returns \nIt would be a mistake to apply band-aids to what are systemic problems.  Temporary \nsolutions can cloak the symptoms but as a consequence will only allow the underlying \nproblems to spread and grow worse. This steadily raises the costs that will inevitably \nhave to be spent to correct the problems, and steadily raises the immediate costs \nassociated with bandaids - rapid staff turnover, inconsistent treatment delivery, increased \ntraining and supervision costs; increased incident and behavior management problems, \nincreased numbers of justifiable lawsuits, and, finally, the increased financial and \nemotional costs of the aftermath of sexual abuse. These are all the very direct \nconsequences of treatment failure and the failure to treat sexually abusive youth. \nI have put months of thought and effort into evaluating both present and planned \nprograms in a way that would be helpful to the California Youth Authority in developing \nand implementing successful programs for' sexually abusive youth.  This report contains \nan excess of  educational material because it is assumed that some readers will have no \nbackground in responding to and treating sexually abusive youth.  That information, of \ncourse, will be redundant to those who are very familiar with the problems of treating \nsexually abusive youth. \nThe Reviewers Qualifications: \nThe opinions expressed by this reviewer are based upon the following experience: (1) \nMembership in the National Task Force on Juvenile Sexual Offending, (2) Collaboration \nin writing both the National Task Force Report and the Revision, which were solicited \n2 \n\n-- --_._-_. \nand published by the National Council of Youth and Family Court Judges; (3) \nMembership on the National Task Force on Sex Offense Specific Residential Standards \nfor Youth, and collaboration in producing the document developed by this task force, the \nNational Sex Offense Standards for Residential Programs; (4) Thirty-three·years \nexperience in residential treatment settings with conduct disordered, delinquent, abused \nand neglected and/or emotionally disturbed youth;  (4) Nineteen years experience \nspecializing exclusively in the treatment of child sexual abuse victims, sexually abusive \nyouth, and their respective families; (5) Thirteen years experience as an independent \nconsultant and trainer specializing in the development, implementation, and evaluation of \noffense specific residential programs for youth; (6) Membership and active participation \nin the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers since 1990 as well as current \nmembership on the Standards Revision Committee; (8) Membership and active \nparticipation in the National Adolescent Perpetration Prevention Network since 1984. \nThe Investigation Procedure: \nIn order to answer the six areas of inquiry it was necessary to examine extensive data and \ndocumentation, conduct individual interviews with central office staff, facility sta£( and \nCYA   wards, observe a variety of program components, and make on site visits to the \nCalifornia Youth Authority Central Office in Sacramento; O.H. Close Correctional \nFacility in Stockton (the Humboldt Sex Offender Program), Fred C. Nelles Correctional \nFacility in Whittier (the Carter Sex Offender Program), Ventura Correctional Facility in \nVentura, the Northern Reception Center in Sacramento, Preston Youth Center in lone( \nthe Oaks Program, N. A  Chaderjian Correctional Facility (the Feather Program), and the \nSacramento parole office \nIn addition,  professional literature pertaining to sexually abusive juveniles was \nextensively reviewed which included: all available national and state standards, \nguidelines or protocols pertaining to the delivery of services and treatment to sexually \nabusive youth in residential settings;  several different sets of professional standards \npertaining to the delivery of services in correctional settings; and the Standards of \nPractice developed by the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers. \nThe persons interviewed, the documentation reviewed, and the observations made eire \ncontained in Addendum A, Band C. \nThe Difficulties of the Evaluation Process: \nAlthough I think the report is as thorough as possible, the evaluation process was difficult \ndue to a number of circumstances.  First, there was a very real difficulty in evaluating a \nsystem that has no uniform policies and procedures for the delivery of sex offender \ntreatment programs.  The current programs, the operationalization of the programs, and \nthe program materials are all different in each individual program. The resource materials \nare either developed by the individual program, or copied from a wide variety of sources. \n3 \n\nAs a result, some of the materials are excellent, some are not, some are outdated, and \nsome are not pertinent to the cultures of the individual wards.  While the program \nstaffing patterns were the same for the different programs on paper, it was difficult to \ndetennine what this mean in real terms. It was not unusual for staff positions to remain \nunfilled as a result of either budget problems or the inability to fill the positions.  The \nsame can be said of the program modules and schedules. \nSecondly, The California Youth Authority serves a population whose age ranges from 13 \nto 25.  As a result of the common practice of increasing time incarcerated, a large cluster \nof the wards are in the 18, 19, and 20 and over age group. Professional research as well as \ncurrent literature nearly always refers to one particular age group - children,. adolescents \nor adults, as well as differentiating males and females. Since nearly all of the wards are \ncommitted as juveniles, it can  be assumed that as a result of living in an isolated \ncorrectional setting many of the normal developmental tasks of adolescence do not take \nplace as usual.  Even the wards in their twenties may continue to be in an adolescent \nstage of development.  Therefore, although most of the citations used in this report will \nrefer to male adolescents it will probably be pertinent to most of the population.  Any \ninformation pertaining solely to female offenders or adults will be identified as such. \nAnother difficulty in conducting the review was in the necessity of assessing the program \nas it is today, as it was several years ago and as it is planned to be.  Question one will \naddress the program as it is today and question six will address the program as planned \nby the sex offender work group. Even as I was in the process of conducting the \nassessment, plans for increasing program standards of practice were being made.  The \nCYA Task Force Report is written to correct many of the problems that wiH be identified \nin this review. This plan requires budgetary changes and a budget has been submitted but \nnot passed. \nOn a positive note, the evaluation process was facilitated in a very efficient and helpful \nmanner by the Deborah Johnson and Jack Wallace of the California Youth Authority and \nSandra Lusich of the Attorney General's Office.  Everything  needed to conduct the \nevaluation was furnished in a timely manner, individuals were cordial and cooperative, \nand quick access was provided  to all materials requested.  There was never any obvious \nattempt at censorship. This reviewer was much appreciative of this. \nExecutive Summary: \nThis reviewer's opinion is that the California Youth Authority rehabilitative programs for \njuvenile sexual  offenders does not meet currently recognized standards of practice in the \nfield.  That is not to say that there aren't very competent professionals working in the sex \noffender programs, or that some of the offense specific programming components are not \nwell conceived and delivered.  Unfortunately, the programs are missing some critical \ncomponents, for example a comprehensive assessment, evaluation, and treatment \nplanning policy and procedure. Programs and staff are constantly cut because of budget \nproblems and staff are not regularly trained either in intervening or behavior management \n4 \n\nwith sexually abusive youth.  The staff is not always selected to meet the needs of the \nwards, but to meet the needs of the staff.  Finally, the overall culture of the programs is \ninstitutional and punitive rather than rehabilitative. \nThe failure to treat sexually abusive youth using standards that are commonly utilized by \nother states can be remedied. The CYA   is clearly capable of developing and \nimplementing a program that will meet current standards of practice in the field. \nHowever, the CYA   does not operate in a vacuum, but is part of a much larger system. \nWhat the CYA actually accomplishes depends not only on their own initiative but on \nwhether or not the necessary funding and support is available.  In previous years budget \nrequests that would have alleviated some of the problems currently being experienced \nhave always been turned down.  This is a matter of record.  There is a new budget \nproposal that would support the Task Force recommendations discussed in question six. \nHowever, this reviewer believes that the Task Force Report and Recommendations need \nto be modified and made broader which would mean analyzing the present budget \nproposal to see if these changes would require additional funding. \nThe financial investment is a sound one, however, as research has demonstrated that \njuvenile sexual offenders are quite capable of change as well as what interventions are the \nmost successful in producing that change.  Those interventions that are successful with \nthis population require an integrated program model, treatment interventions that impact \ndirectly on the problems that support sexually offending behavior, teaching non offending \nmanagement strategies, adequate time to affect the internalization and practice of these \nstrategies, and enough competently trained staff selected for the ability to work well with \nthis population. The following data informs us of the soundness of an investment in the \nsuccessful management of programs for sexually abusive youth. \no  30% of child molestations and 20 % of rapes are committed by juveniles (Federal \nBureau oflnvestigation (1993); Murphy and Page (2000». \no  33-50% of adult sex offenders began offending in adolescence (Prentky et al. \n(2000».33% of the adult offenders who have no juvenile charges are thought to \nhave committed undetected sex offenses (prentky and Knight (1993». \no  46% ofj uvenile offenders were under 12 at age of onset (Burton (2000». \no  18% ofa sample of3,000 previously sexually abused men and women were \nvictimized by females (Finklehor (1990». \no  The statistics on recidivism range from just 7% -14% for adolescents who have \ncompleted offense specific treatment programs.  Rates of non-sexual recidivism \nare generally higher (25% to 50%) (Becker, (1990». \nPlease see Addendum D for information about sexual abuse as a public health problem \nand about the efficacy of treatment for sexual abusers.  See Addendum E for further \nresearch based information about sexually abusive youth. \n5 \n\nThe Costs of Treatment Failure and the Failure to Treat: \nThere are two very logical and compelling reasons to provide sex offender treatment: \ndoing so protects the public, and provides the most cost-effective services.  A 73-100% \nreduction in recidivism not only protects the public, but, in doing so, will actively save \nCalifornians millions of dollars which could be applied to other much needed services. \nFew other budget requests can promise this. \nRobert Prentky, Ph.D. of the Bridgewater Massachusetts Correctional Facility developed \na model for program success based upon its overall cost-effectiveness.  Included in his \ncalculations were the cost of prosecuting a single instance of recidivism, incarcerating the \nrecidivist, and treating a single victim, compared to the cost of providing appropriate \ntreatment to an offender during their original incarceration.  Prentky found that the \nprogram at Bridgewater would be cost effective if it merely reduced recidivism by 11 %. \nApplying this model to California, Janice Marques determined that such programs would \nbe cost-effective if they produced only a 14% decrease in recidivism. \nIt is noteworthy that these estimates are very conservative.  Some estimates of the overall \ncosts to society of sexual offending run into the millions per offender, and these estimates \naren't unreasonable.  A great many of the factors simply aren't quantifiable in advance, \nthus Dr. Prentky's conservative formula.  Yet, the impact upon victims, their families, the \nhuman resources, legal, law enforcement, and correctional systems, legal costs to victims \nand offenders, psychiatric costs to victims and their families, the likely reduction in social \nand economic contributions of inadequately treated juvenile offenders and their victims \nalike, and the simple exacerbation of public fears all create a very real and heavy burden \nupon society in general. \nIn \"The Economics of Implementing Intensive In-prison Sex-offender Treatment \nPrograms\" (1999), an Australian Institute of Criminology report, Ron Donato and Martin \nShanahan estimated that intangible costs of child sex abuse were ten times the dollar \nvalue of tangible costs. The AlC Director, Adam Graycar, verified that the tangible cost \nsavings for Australia per every 100 juvenile sex offenders treated would be $3.98 million \nper year.  The tangible costs of an adjudicated sex offense in California, where it now \ncosts $48,000 per year simply to incarcerate the offender, are higher.  Therefore so too, \nexponentially, would be the amount of money saved by the State and the public at large \nby the provision of effective juvenile sex offender treatment program to all of the wards \nwho need it. None of the above estimates factored in the tangible and intangible costs to \nthe government and public of lawsuits that are often the result of not providing treatment \nthat meets standards of practice commonly accepted. \nSimply put, the provision of appropriate juvenile sex offender treatment within the CYA   \nwould significantly reduce the financial and psychological costs of sex offender \nrecidivism to Californians.  Sexual victimization is one of the most costly types of \nrecidivism, in all senses.  . \n6 \n\nCalifornia has not always failed to provide appropriately for its incarcerated youth. \nOriginally California was a pioneering State both in the difficult field ofj uvenile sex: \noffender treatment and in juvenile corrections in general.  The nation owes California a \ndebt for the great number of professional, programming, and operational standards \ncurrently in general practice around the U.S., Canada, Australia, and elsewhere. \nA comment often heard from people working in the system was that the CYA's ability to \nprovide appropriate treatment, education and training to juveniles has decreased \nsignificantly over the last decade and this is usually attnDuted to the change to a \ncorrectional model. Unfortunately for the state of Cali fomi a it has 12% of the nation's \nyouth and 251'10 of its incarcerated juveniles. While juvenile crime is increasing in \nCalifornia, it is declining on a national level. \nSome might think: that California simply can't afford to make the changes and provide the \nresources needed for even an adequate juvenile sex offender treatment program right \nnow, due to the budget crisis.  In truth, for that very reason California can't afford not to. \nJuvenile sex offenders have been proven capable of leading productive, non-offending \nlives if they receive appropriate treatment.  Given that treatment methods capable of both \nsignificantly reducing recidivism and of facilitating the overall rehabilitation of sexually \nabusive youth currently exist, and that these methods have proven to provide significant \nreturns in government dollars invested then it is both reasonable and prudent to fund sex \noffender programs that will meet the current standards of practice. \nThe resources available to change the situation, for juveniles to be rehabilitated, deterred \nfrom crime and lead a productive life depends on the ability of policy makers to find \ncreative reforms that can change priorities and commitment patterns. \nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY: \n•  Fund a permanent position in the Central Office to oversee and monitor the \ndevelopment and implementation of standards of practice for all programs that \nserve sexually·abusive youth.  The job responsibilities of this position are outlined \nin question six. \n•  Adopt The Sex Offender Task Force Plan with modification. The Task Force plan \nprovides a standardized curriculum, enhanced family involvement, nationally \nrecognized performance standards, enhanced staffing patterns, new psychological \ntesting protocols, new assessment and monitoring tools and new staff training \nmandates. The details of this plan are outlined in the answers to number six. \nThere are additions to the report that must be made and some considerations that \nmust be pondered.  These are discussed in question six. \n7 \n\n•  Develop a plan of implementation so that there is an action plan for making the \nchanges necessary to bring the programs for all sexually abusive wards in line \nwith nationally recognized standards of practice. The sources for these standards \nof practice are part of Addendum A under Review of General Information. \n•  Make the changes necessary to move from a correctional model to a rehabilitative \nmodel. \n•  Additional recommendations include but are not limited to the following: \no  Monies should be allocated by whatever system is legally responsible for \ndoing so, to fund juvenile sex offender programs ~t meet minimal \nstandards of care, that are comparable to those already developed by other \nstates and by national initiatives. \no  Treat the majority of sexually abusive youth in a therapeutic milieu, using \nthe outpatient model only for those who are able to live within a general \npopulation and maintain a non offending lifestyle. \no  Any ward with a history of being sexually abusive in their case records, \nwho has disclosed sexual abusive behavior for the first time while a ward \nofCYA  , or who has committed sexually abusive acts while in the CYA  , \nshould have treatment as a sex offender, whether they were initially \nadjudicated for a sexual crime or not. \no  Develop a method for licensing and accrediting programs and providers \nalong with the appropriate accountability measures for doing so.  The ones \ncurrently suggested by the Task Force Plan are good. \no  Develop and implement a comprehensive offense specific training \nprogram to provide staff that has any responsibility for or interaction with \nsexually abusive wards the knowledge and skills necessary for the \nunderstanding, management and treatment of those wards. Training must \nbe competency based with a way to ensure that the transfer of knowledge \nhas taken place. \no  Include a comprehensive policy and procedure on the assessment and \nevaluation of all wards who are sexual offenders either within the current \nreception centers or by the establishment of a special sex offender \ndiagnostic center or centers within the CY A. Use this assessment as the \nbasis for a comprehensive treatment plan for each individual ward. \no  Use thorough risk assessments to ensure that all youth committed to the \nCYA for sexually abusive acts are being placed in the least restrictive \nprogram available to meet their treatment needs and to provide community \nsafety. \n8 \n\no  Involve families in all aspects of the treatment program from assessment \nto discharge. \no  Staff the sex offender programs exclusively with individuals who, as \nverified through accepted and approved industry-testing methods, \npersonally and professionally qualify as those most effective for working \nwith juvenile sex offender populations. \no  Develop a behavioral management system that is based on teaching \npro social behaviors while providing logical and consistent consequences \nfor antisocial behavior .. ' \no  Develop an integrated program design so that all program components -\neducation, mental health, physical health, vocational and leisure needs, \nfamily involvement, etc - will work together to teach non-offending \nbehavior patterns. \no  Ensure separate living accommodations and programs for the young adult \nand adolescent populations \no  Develop behaviorally based discharge criteria, which depend upon \nobservable, objective attainment of treatment goals. \no  Ensure that every ward discharged has a support group, containment group \nor relapse prevention group that understands their individual relapse \nprevention or safety plan. \no  Develop and implement a program for sexually abusive females that is \ngender specific. \no  Continue to develop the strategies to provide competent, effective \ntreatment so that the existing waste of resources, program failures, threats \nto public safety, and drain to the economy are decreased. \no  Develop a policy and procedure that requires a pre sentencing assessment \nprior to placement in the CYA   \no  Coordinate with parole from commitment to discharge. \no  Develop parole as an extension of treatment and informed supervision, \no  Assess wards for  substance abuse problems which occur in the context \nof sexual offending for aU sexually abusive youth \no  Enlist someone who is an expert ( national organizations such as the \nAssociation for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers and the Center for Sex \n9 \n\nOffender Management are good referral sources)  at designing treatment \nenvironments for delinquent adolescents in general and juvenile sex \noffenders in particular to do an analysis of present structures to see what \ncan be modified in the present structure or if a new structure specially \ndesigned for sex offenders would be more cost effective. \no  Ensure that materials are culturally sensitive and that staff are all \nculturally competent. \no  Ensure that all program materials and resources are appropriate for \ndevelopmentally delayed wards, wards that cannot read and wards with \nhearing problems. \no  Provide comprehensive case management reviews for the youth who \naren't making acceptable progress in treatment in order to make \nalternative plans. \no  Establish vocational and work experience training as part of every sex \noffender program. \no  Consult with some of the medical experts, mental health experts, \neducational experts and behavior management experts who work with \nsexually abusive youth in order to develop specific protocols for those \nareas that take the specific needs of sexually abusive youth into \nconsideration. . \no  Consider the development of other levels of care under the California \nYouth Authority, which could be less intensive than institutionalization. \no  A quality assurance system operated both from the central office and at the \nlocal program level, should be developed to address risk management \nrequirements and performance at a comprehensive systems level for this \nparticular population. \nRECOMENDTIONS FOR STATE POLICY CHANGES: \no  The CYA   should take leadership in the development of an initiative to establish a \nmultidisciplinary multi agency task force whose purpose is to develop a \ncomprehensive statewide plan setting enforceable standards regarding the \ncommunity's response to sexually abusive youth. \no  Develop legislation to establish appropriate minimum standards for sex offender \nprogramming and operations, and create a licensing and inspection system. There \n10 \n\nhas been extremely good work done by other state systems that could serve as \nguidelines \nThe Obligation to Provide Juvenile Sex Offender Treatment: \nThe stated purpose of the California Youth Authority under the revolutionary Youth \nCorrection Authority Act of 1941 was \"to protect society by substituting training and \ntreatment for retributive punishment of young persons found guilty of public offenses.\" \nBy the mid-60s, the success of California's approach had made it not only the norm, but \nalso the formal legal policy of the United States, certified in Kent v. United States (1966) \nby the U.S. Supreme Court.  Though adjustments have taken place to account for the \nadjudication ofj uveniles as adults when they commit murders, the Court has maintained \nthe special importance of individually assessing the circumstances of the juveniles before \nsentencing (Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 (1988); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 \nU.S. 104 (1982); Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361 (1989»  the general rehabilitative \npolicy has remained in place.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has continued to emphasize the \nspecial developmental status of all those under 18 and the obligation to provide them \nspecial protection. (Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997». \nCiting the U.S. Supreme Court, in P.W.G. v. State (1997), the Florida Supreme Court \nclarified the purpose of American juvenile justice systems, the role of the juveniles within \nthem, and the legal responsibilities of American judges, lawmakers and authorities: \n\"A child offender, even after being adjudged delinquent, is never held to be a \ncriminal, even if the act would be considered a crime if committed by an adult. \nThe key to this difference in approach lies in the juvenile justice systems ultimate \naims. Juveniles are considered to be rehabilitatable. They do not need punishment. \nTheir need lies in the area of treatment.\" \nIronically, the Florida court made this statement in the course ofaffmning a lower court's \ndecision to order the plaintiff juvenile, who was being tried on unrelated, non-sexual \ncharges, into the offense-specific residential sex offender treatment which the State had \nfailed to provide him despite previous sexual offenses and a professionally identified \nneed. \n11 \n\nTHE PROGRAM EVALUATION: \nADDRESSING THE SIX AREAS OF INQUIRY: \nI was asked to specifically target the program evaluation in such a way that the six \nquestions identified at the beginning of the report would be answered as thoroughly as \npossible.  The rest of this report will be dedicated to doing just that. \n1.  Question:  Does the CYA Offer Adequate Sex Offender Treatment to All of the \nWards Committed to the CYA by a Juvenile Court for a Sexual Offense? \nProblem: The California Youth Authority does not offer adequate sex offender treatment \nto all of the Wards committed to the CYA by a Juvenile Court for a Sexual Offense.  The \nsecond part of the question - is the treatment provided adequate is answered in the next \nsection. At the time I conducted this review, the Department of the Youth Authority was \nproviding treatment for approximately 160 sexually abusive youth - leaving a large \nnumber -approximately 900+ offenders untreated. Around 340 wards were on parole and \nit was not known who had received treatment and who had not without a great deal of \nresearch. At that time, The Humboldt Sex Offender Program at 0  H Close Correctional \nFacility housed 60 wards and The Carter Sex Offender Program at Fred C. Nelles Youth \nCorrectional Facility housed 50 wards in secure residential settings. Another 45 or so \nwere being treated in intensive treatment or specialized counseling programs. As of July \n1,2003 two other programs were opened:  The Feather Program at N. A. Chadetjian \n'Correctional Facility which serves 50 wards and J Company at Hennan G Stark Youth \nCorrectional Facility that serves 48 wards bringing the total to 208 beds. This means that \napproximately 900 sexually abusive youth are paroled without any treatment at all. \nThe female population identified as sexually abusive were not being counted at all and \nwere not being offered sex offender treatment.  The rationale given was that that the \nnumbers were too small to warrant a program.  When asked to identify the number of \nfemale sex offenders in the California Youth Authority, the answers given varied from \none or two to eight or nine.  One staff member at Ventura reported that although females \ndidn't come in identified as sexual abusers very often, you could find histories of \nsexually abusive behavior as you reviewed their charts.  It is doubtful that any estimate of \nthe number of female sexual offenders in the California Youth Authority would be valid \nwithout a complete review of the charts. \nRecommendation:  Any ward with a history of being sexually abusive in their case \nrecords or who has disclosed sexual abusive behavior for the first time while a ward of \nCYA  , or who has committed sexually abusive treatment while in the CYA  , should have \ntreatment as a sexual  offender, whether they were initially adjudicated for a sexual crime \nor not.  This is also the recommendation of the Task Force Report. \nThe CYA   should review the charts of all female wards in order to determine if there is \nany history or suspicion of these wards having committed sexual offenses. Any female \n12 \n\nwards identified by this review as sexually abusive should then complete a sex offender \nspecific assessment in order to determine their treatment needs. Treatment plans should \nreflect offense specific problems and goals. The female wards identified should be part of \nan offense specific program that is gender based. \nProblem:  The sex offender treatment programs are not adequate for several reasons. \nEven though they are inadequate, a number wards  benefit from the programs due to the \npossible occurrence of a  number of variables: the dedication of a number of overworked \nbut competent staff and the characteristics of the youth themselves. \nWhat is at the basis of this failure to delivery offense specific programming to all the \nwards that need this intervention? There are extremely competent people within the \nCYA  . There are also programs and pieces of programs that are really excellent.  Some of \nthe vocational programs, for example, are excellent.  I had the pleasure of benefiting from \nthe culinary program while at Preston and was very impressed by the quality of the food \nand the professionalism of the young waiters.  The need for community reintegration is \nbasic to sex offender programs.  However, most of the vocational programs are not open \nto the sexually abusive youth. At Fred C. Nelles I' was pleased to hear about the effort to \nprovide for the spiritual needs of wards who represented a large variety of religions. The \nuse of spirituality as part of value building is a common part of many sex offender \nprograms and I am referring to the need for a belief in a system of values.  At O. H. \nClose I learned about the use of sweat lodges as a therapeutic intervention - honoring the \nNative Americans within the program and are a common and acceptable part of sex \noffender programming in programs for Native Americans. At Ventura I observed a group \nof boys attending a sex offender specific group on a voluntary basis.  They were eager for \nhelp and quite astute as to their needs for maintaining a non offending lifestyle.  I \nattended therapy groups at Humboldt, Carter, Ventura and Preston, without prior notice. \nThe therapists were good and the groups were excellent.  At the Northern Clinic I \nobserved a meeting to discuss collaboration between the youth authority and the San \nFrancisco parole office.  At the Central Office, I spent time with three people who knew \nas much about sex offender treatment as anyone - Kip Lowe, Jack Wallace and Deborah \nJohnson. \nDespite the talent and ability within the California Youth Authority and the presence of a \nnumber of really excellent rehabilitative program components, the sex offender programs \nare just not what they should be.  At this time the CYA   is offering treatment interventions \nto sexually abusive wards in short episodes, and often in facilities distant from their \nhomes and therefore from many of the support, monitoring and oversight resources they \nwill need both during treatment and upon release.  The programs, which do exist, are as \ngood as the staff on shift at anyone moment in time, and change as the staff change. \nUnfortunately, bits and pieces do not constitute a total program.  The programs are a \nhodgepodge and just do not meet current standards of practice, even minimal ones.  The \nprograms are understaffed, there is a lot ofstafftumover, some of the staff is not \nappropriate to work with this population and some are not trained to do so. Even some of \n13 \n\nthe program currently planned is not being delivered - and the reasons cited are \nconsistent - it's not in the budget, they haven't replaced that staff yet, they \naren't trained, they don't hire stafffor their abilities but for their seniority, there is no \noversight, there is no consistency, there is just not enough time! \nAs a group, the psychologists in the program are well trained and very competent. \nHowever, there are either not enough of them and or job descriptions are unreasonable as \nfar as a forty or fifty hour week are concerned.  In addition some of the job requirements \nare not related directly to the clinical work for which they are qualified.  IfC  alifornia \nonly had a small population ofj uvenile sex offender wards, with the current resources \nand qualified staff available you could operate one of the best small treatment programs \nin the nation.  The actual population and resource numbers, however, have created a \nsituation which has limited California's ability to provide the necessary standard of \nprogramming. \nA number of staff repeatedly told me that there were not enough qualified staff, training, \ntreatment modalities, and resources to provide an adequate program.  They did not even \nmention the conditions of the physical plants, which are dreadful.  Comm~nts from both \nwards and staffwere to the point: \nWards: \no  \"There's not enough treatment time\". \no  \"The majority of the time there is nothing to do and we just sit on our bunks\" . \no  \"There's lots of stuff that shouldn't happen and it gets covered up\" \nStaff: \no  \"A great deal of criminal activity goes on - gambling, lying, stealing, \nmanipulation through threat, and illicit trade\" \no  \"I would like to stay with the department but there is not enough training, not \nenough programs- it's a shame because the program really works when they have \nthe time to put it in place\" \nRecommendation:  The sex offender work group completed its work in May with \nthe development of a comprehensive program design for all sexually abusive youth \nwithin the CYA  . Following this the work group offered training to at least 45 staff in the \ndelivery of this program.  This is a good start towards developing a program that meets \nminimal standards of practice.  I met with this group several times.  It was my impression \nthat the work group  developed a plan that not only met as many minimal standards of \npractice as possible while keeping in mind what they thought would be realistic as far as \na budget request was concerned. There are a number of areas that need to be strengthened \nand I have made recommendations to cover those areas. \n14 \n\n---_. __ .. _---\nOne of those recommendations has to do with monitoring the programs and staff on a \nregular basis as a risk management and accountability measure. Some states certify both \npractioners and programs as pare of this monitoring process. Alan Listiak, Ph.D. \nCoordinator of Sex Offender Program Certification, Minnesota Department of \nCorrections in an informal correspondence says: \n\"In Minnesota there is no individual certificationllicensure for \nproviders of sex offender treatment.  The tack taken here is to certify \nat the program level using standards that define: staff requirements; \nstaff qualifications; admissions and intake assessments; treatment \nplans; client progress; discharge; standards of service delivery; \nprogram standards; quality assurance/program improvement.  The process is \nregulated by the Department of Corrections and programs apply to the \nDepartment and are then reviewed on site for compliance. \nThe movement was started at the legislative level by an effort to \ndevelop a sex offender treatment system in the state that was tied to a \n\"treatment fund.\"  There was a need to have programs and providers be \naccountable for payments from the fund.  At the time, only a couple of \ntreatment providers and/or persons savvy about sex offender treatment \nwere involved.  The system was intended to model itself after the way \nchemical dependency treatment was provided in the state.  It turned out \nthat the sex offender system could not parallel the chemical  dependent model for \na variety of reasons and, ultimately, the sex offender treatment fund went \naway.  A system of grants and contracts already in place became the sole \nfunding source at the state level..  The certification was to apply to \nboth outpatient and inpatient sex offender treatment programs, both \njuvenile and adult.  After more several years of discussion and \nargument, the legislature rescinded the requirement to certify \noutpatient programs, leaving inpatient/residential programs, both \njuvenile and adult, under the authorizing legislation. \nThe standards for juvenile and adult programs each had their own public \nadvisory committee (with most stakeholders involved, including \nproviders) and followed the procedures for promulgating administrative \nlaw in Minnesota.  This included public notice and the development of a \ndocument entitled a Statement of Need and Reasonableness that presented \nthe need for and reasonableness of every item in the standards, along \nwith a financial impact analysis, that was submitted to the \nadministrative law judge.\" \n15 \n\nWhat Kind of Treatment is Adequate Treatment? \nTreatment must be offense specific. \"Offense specific treatment is distinguished from \nother kinds of interventions because it crosses the line between the treatment of criminal \nbehavior and the treatment of mental health and behavioral disorders\" (Rich (2003».  The \nresult is an approach that is a melding of these disciplines into a multidisciplinary \nmethodology which is specifically designed to effectively change sexually abusive \npatterns of behavior and stop future victimization.  This is a specialized discipline called \nsex offender specific treatment or offense specific treatment.  The National Task Force on \nJuvenile Sexual Offending (1993) states that the interface between the mental health and \ncriminal justice system is necessary for a sound public policy in regard to sexually \nabusive youth. \nIn addition, offense specific treatment should take place in the least restrictive \nenvironment needed to ensure community protection and provide the offender the level of \ntreatment required.  Only individuals who require severe restrictions in order to manage \ntheir level of risk to the community should be housed in secure correctional or mental \nhealth facilities. \nRecommendation: Standards of practice, protocols or guidelines for sex offense \nspecific treatment programs have been developed and implemented by the states of \nColorado, Oregon, lllinois, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Utah, Virginal, Texas \nand South Carolina. There may be others as well. This is an excellent opportunity for \nCalifornia and the California Youth Authority to take leadership in an initiative to bring \ntogether a multi agency multidisciplinary task force to develop uniform interventions so \nthat these agencies can work together more efficiently in establishing a coordinated \ndelivery of services to juvenile sex offenders. \nIt is also an opportunity for CYA   to explore the possibility of providing different levels \nof programming.  A continuum of services for sexually abusive or aggressive individuals, \ncovering a range of treatment intensities and community access would be more cost \neffective than what is presently offered. \nWhat are Levels of Intervention? \nPresently, the California Youth authority's level of interventions are composed of a track \nfor sexually abusive youth in the intensive treatment programs, in the specialized \ncounseling programs, and the most restrictive possible - two secure residential programs. \nDifferent levels of intervention are needed because sexually abusive youth are a very \nheterogeneous group. They range along a continuum from the naIve experimenter to the \ncriminally sadistic, and from the developmentally delayed to the gifted.  Different types \nof sexually abusive youth need different levels and intensity of intervention.  This not \nonly more effectively addresses each youth's particular level of risk and treatment needs, \n16 \n\nbut is more cost effective as well. Some states will not contract for services with any \nagency that does not have a continuum of care. \nHowever, in order to detennine the specific level of intervention required by each youth \nit is necessary to conduct offense specific assessments which are periodically updated. \nWithout such assessments it is almost impossible to make solid recommendations \nregarding the environmental restrictions necessary to safely treat an individual.  The \nyouth's sexually abusive behavior pattern is only one of the variables to consider in \nmaking placement decisions. \nTo explain:  A continuum of care includes a range of sequenced services from least to \nmost intensive, and from least to most restrictive.  This allows a youth to move up or \ndown from one level to another based on treatment progress or regression, and allows \nproviders to closely match treatment to the specific needs of each youth.  An effective \ncontinuum of care can be provided by one entity/agency/organization or by several \nagencies working collaboratively. \nDr. Steve Bengis was the first professional in the field of sexual aggression to suggest the \nefficacy ofa continuum of care for this population, and he identified a number of levels \nwhich included locked secure programs, community based treatment, residential \ntreatment settings, specialized foster care, supervised apartments, special education day \nschools, and specialized vocational programs.  This list is often modified by individual \nstates to meet their own particular needs. \nTwo of the first states to develop statewide continuums of care were the states of Utah \nand Oregon.  Their designs identified a comprehensive continuum of care, the admission \ncriteria for each level, the amount and intensity of programming and staffing necessary, \nand the security of the perimeter required. \nAfter reviewing several ward charts which were picked randomly, it was my opinion that \nsome of those wards would be better served in less restrictive and more appropriate \nenvironments.  Perhaps not all of the juvenile sexual offenders who become wards of the \nCalifornia Youth Authority require the extremely intensive, restrictive, and expensive \ntreatment environment of a parameter secure correctional facility.  If this is concerning \nafter the review of only a few charts, one wonders what a more thorough review would \nfind.  However, this will require an extensive review or change in assessment procedure \nin order to determine this. \nA pilot program in Jefferson County, Colorado directs youth arrested for sex offenses \ndirectly to an assessment center.  There a risk screening instrument is administered in \norder to determine whether the youth should be detained in a secure setting, returned to \nthe home, or transferred to alternative placement (foster, group home, etc) while they \nreceive sex offender specific treatment.  The assessment center works with the family and \nyouth, and can refer family members to community counseling, ifnecessary.  Under \nthis system, treatment can start before sentencing occurs.  Jefferson County has also \n17 \n\nmade a concerted effort to bring all delinquent residents of that county home for services. \nThis was decided after research determined that those youth with family involvement \nwere more successful than those who did not have any support system. \nRecommendation: The CYA   should conduct an extensive review of charts to \ndetermine ifwards currently incarcerated could be placed in a less intensive level of care. \nIft he recommendations concerning assessments are put into practice, this could avoid \nerrors in placement in the future. \nDoes the Physical Environment Matter? \nWhen the physical environment of a program determines the program interventions, then \nthe program begins in a one down position.  The program's effectiveness and efficiency \nin terms of treatment success and cost - can be seriously undermined when the program \nmust adapt to the physical environment, when behavior management is dependent on the \nprogram environment and its configuration, and when the environment is conducive to \nserious incidents such as suicide, sexual acting out; gambling, drugs, and violence etc. \nEven by prison standards the physical environment of the CYA   institutions is not good. \nProgram evaluations always include time evaluating the physical environment for risk \nmanagement issues that are specific to sexually abusive youth.  Time did not allow for \nanything other than a standard walk through which in itself was enough to see that the \nenvironment wasn't conducive to ease of supervision, the socializing of uns ocialized \nyouth, or teaching groups and organizing activities. \nThis is not to suggest that the environment should be fancy or anything but utilitarian, \ndesigned to meet basic human needs, and promote the ease of program delivery and \nsafety.  Just a few of the following are examples: \n•  In one program showers and toilets in one facility are closed from the ward's \ncommon living spaces by tom curtains.  This lack of privacy encourages \nvoyeurism, sexual fantasizing and sexual acting out.  This is not acceptable in a \nsex offender program for obvious reasons. \n•  In one program 50 youth are house in one large room with beds back to back \nagainst the wall.  The supervision is primarily by one person in a tower \noverlooking the room. Youths reported not feeling safe, being kept awake by \nwards masturbating, or such things as wetting the bed but being afraid to get up, \netc. \n•  In one program wards complained of being locked in cells for long periods of \ntime when there is no program or staff to attend to them outside the cells. \n•  Many wards interviewed complained of cold water, bad smells, mildew and mold, \nno heat, feeling unsafe, having no privacy. Etc. \nRecommendation:  The CYA   should have someone who is an expert at \ndesigning treatment environments for delinquent adolescents in general and juvenile sex \n18 \n\noffenders in particular do an analysis of present structures to see if modifications in the \npresent structures will suffice or if a new structure specially designed for sex offenders \nwould be more cost effective.  There are several research based studies on the effect of \nthe physical environment on the change process.  Correctional institutions are moving \naway from the huge concrete block like facilities and building smaller facilities that are \neasier to supervise and keep safe. \nWhat about Mixing Populations of Adolescent and Adult Wards? \nThe CYA   serves a population from 13 to 25.  This is a wide difference, and includes age \ngroups with significant developmental and experiential differences.  Naturally, this \ncauses problems in housing, in resource allocation, in appropriate staff and ward training, \netc.  Population management does make a concerted effort to keep the age range in any \none program to no more than four years, but this is very difficult with all of the other \nconsiderations which must be accommodated.  When there is a wide age range in one \nsetting there is always danger that the older and more powerful wards will abuse the \nyounger wards, and it is widely accepted that such abuse is not uncommon in institutional \nsettings.  One older ward interviewed at Ventura had been moved from one unit to \nanother because she had been predatory towards younger wards in the first unit.  When \nquestioned she acknowledged that she did have a problem and was a danger to younger \ngirls.  While this was certainly a good decision it is one that could have been made prior \nto placement with a thorough assessment protocol on the current risk of dangerousness \nfor appropriate placement.  It could also have been used as a therapeutic and safety issue \nif this ward had been in an offense specific program.  Moving the client will protect the \nyounger wards but will do nothing to eliminate the behavior. \nThere are some similarities between adult and adolescents who sexually abuse but there \nare also striking differences, which make it critical that they be treated in programs that \nare developed specifically for their age groups.  The similarities are in the patterns of \nemotional, cognitive and behavioral interactions preceding and following the abusive \nbehaviors as well as similar etiological factors.  Both adults and juveniles have had \nexperiences of maltreatment or neglect, trauma and witnessing violence, disrupted \nattachments, loss, dysfunctional role models and co-occurring disorders. (Ryan and Lane, \n(1997». \nOne thing remains unclear though - how many of the wards over 18 are actually still \nadolescents developmentally?  If they have been institutionalized all of their adolescence \nthen it is quite possible that wards may be chronologically adults but developmentally 15 \nor 16.  This is unknown, however, but a very important point in decision taking. \nThe differences between adolescents and adults are primarily related to human growth \nand development, the greater flexibility of youth, and the briefer history of the offending \nmentality and behavior in younger offenders.  This greater amenability to treatment of \nyounger offenders is what makes a commitment to early intervention so practical.  Adults \nmore often have deviant sexual fantasies and or arousal, and elaborate defenses that deny, \nrationalize, minimize or distort their beliefs about the nature of their behaviors and they \n19 \n\nare more deeply ingrained.  The sexually abusive adolescent is much less likely to be \nassociated with deviant arousal (Hunter (1996»  and is still amenable to a change of \nbehavior. \nThe goals in current treatment approaches for adult sexual abusers are predicated on \nconcepts oflifelong management strategies.  For adolescents the treatment interventions \nare delivered with the expectations that the youth can develop the life coping skills \nnecessary to lead a prosociallife, to develop an internal sense of personal competence, \ncontrol and responsibility, develop a positive sexual identity, and develop the ability to \ncreate non-abusive relationships. \nRecommendation: Although it is unclear whether the age group 19 to 25 is \ndevelopmentally mature as well as physically mature, it is a serious consideration \nnonetheless.  The continuing efforts to keep these populations separated should be \nmonitored closely and receive greater priority and support.  When it is necessary for \nreasons beyond the CYA's control to house a few older wards with the younger wards \nthere should be safety programs designed specifically for that situation.  It is not \nacceptable to house a few younger wards with primarily older wards because the risk \nfactors are so high.  In addition, assessments and resources are different for the \nadolescents and young adults.  This should be a matter of concern and attention while \nplanning programs.  One example is the vocational training program - there is a need of \nthe young adults who will be joining the work force for vocational training that prepares \nthem to do this.  For the younger wards a vocational training program based on \nunderstanding all of the issues involved in entering the work world - such as hygiene, \ncommunication skill, etc. may be a sufficient start. \nWhat are the Program Components of Offense Specific Treatment? \nAn offense specific program is generally composed of three major parts - Assessment \nand Evaluation, Multimodal Multi-Disciplinary Treatment, and Aftercare Monitoring. \n1. Assessments and Evaluation: \nPresently, the eYA conducts initial assessments at the reception centers. The Intensive \nTreatment Programs and the Specialized Counseling Programs conduct much more \nextensive assessments once the ward is in their respective programs.  None of these, \nhowever, are offense specific.  CYA   uses one sex offense specific assessment tool, a \ndocument that they have developed themselves, the Sex Offender Referral Document. \nAlthough SORD is not research based or validated it has been carefully developed and \nhas served the purpose of identifying the wards that need to be placed in the limited \nnumber of treatment spaces available in the Youth Authority. Used alone, however, \nSORD is not always a reliable indicator, although it could be useful as part of an \nassessment package.  If during a ward's placement in a sex offender program the \npsychologist has the time and resources they can conduct other assessments as needed. \nThese are currently done in only the most serious cases. \n20 \n\nIn the words of a staff member:  \"Decisions are currently made based on monetary rather \nthan treatment concerns. Professionals working with sex offenders have to work within \nthose guidelines, doing the best that they can with what they have, but knowing either \nthat its not good enough or a poor compromise\" \nIn order to make informed placement and treatment decisions for sexually abusive or \naggressive individuals, juvenile or adult, one must be able to assess numerous sources of \ninformation in order to evaluate an individual's risk of re-offending, his/ her danger to the \ncommunity, and the appropriate level of clinical intervention and supervision required. \nu.s. \nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the  Department of \nJustice (Righthand and Welch (2001»  states that comprehensive clinical assessments are \nrequired in order to determine risk and facilitate treatment, and emphasizes that any \nattempt to explain or treat juvenile sex offenders must be based on the specific factors \npertinent to the juveniles' offenses and individual psychology.  To meet minimum \nstandards, the CYA   assessment and evaluation procedure must involve a battery of tests \n(validated by research) in addition to the SORD in order to determine the most \nappropriate placement and treatment protocol.  Assessments must be administered by \ntrained and supervised staff.  Even though CYA   staff has been trained to conduct the \nSORD, in one facility a staff member after completing a SORD placed a ward in a sex \noffender group. This staffhad been trained in the use of the SORD. In reviewing the \nward's chart with the psychologist at the facility, we found numerous incidents of \npersonal victimization but none of victimizing others. \nThere are six areas of assessment that should be conducted with sexually abusive youth: \npretriallinvestigative; pre-sentencing risk prognosis; post-adjudication! disposition! \nneeds-based treatment planning and treatment evaluation; pre- discharge; and, \nmonitoring! follow up (The National Task Force Report (1993».  A CYA   policy and \nprocedure on assessments could require these as well as the identified instruments to use. \nThe areas needing assessment identified by the State of Colorado Sex Offender \nManagement Board are typical of those identified both in the literature, professional \nstandards, and by other states? The Colorado Sex Offender Management Board \ndeveloped State standards fot interventions with sexually abusive youth and adults in \n2001 and 2002.  These were developed by local experts and national consultants \nrepresenting a variety of relevant disciplines and agencies with funding from the Center \nfor Sex Offender Management in Washington, DC.  The resulting standard of practice for \nassessment identified the following areas of focus: \n\"Current mental status; stress/coping strategies; sexual deviance; denial; stability \nin current living situation; academic and vocational issues; communication and \nproblem solving skills; social support; acting out behaviors; cognitive distortions; \ncurrent family composition; history of divorce/separation in family; current \nmental illness; drug and alcohol use; cultural issues; the complete sexual history \nincluding sexual knowledge (where learned); sex education history; non-\n21 \n\noffending sexual history~ masturbation (age of onset, frequency, fantasies)~ sexual \ncompulsivityl impulsivity, sexual victimization; range of sexual behaviors; sexual \narousal/interest; sexual preferencel orientation; sexual dysfunctions; sexual \nattitudes/distortions (i.e. hyper~masculinity); types of sexually abusive behavior \nthe youth has committed~ indications of progression over time~ level of \naggression~ frequency ofbehavior~ style and type of victim access; preferred \nvictim type; associated arousal pattems~ changes in sexual abuse behaviors or \nrelated thinking; the individual's intent and motivation for offending; the extent of \nthe youth's openness and honesty; internal and external risk factors; victim \nempathy; victim selection characteristics; other adjudications and offenses; non \ncharged offenses; property offenses; typology, risk to self; denial of offense; risk \nto others; criminal behavior and conduct; risk for sexual recidivism and protective \nfactors; native environment; living situation; friends and associates; extra \ncurricular activities; awareness and internalization of the impact of behavior on \nvictims and others; any other adjudications; attribution of responsibility; external \nsupport; long range planning; readiness for services; and, attribution of \nresponsibility. \" \nIn addition, Colorado has also identified many of the options available for gathering this \ninformation, including clinical interviews, evaluation tests and instruments, surveys, self \nreport instruments, and sources of collaborative information. \nRecommendation:  The California Youth Authority should review both the research \nand the literature, as well national and state policies already developed as possible \nguidelines for a state wide policy regarding assessment. The recommendations that the \nTask Force made regarding a proposed assessment protocol are good but could be more \ncomprehensive. Suggestions for additions will be made in a later part of the review. \nIn 1986, in a document entitled \"Sex Offender Task Force Report\" Recommendation No. \n1 stated the following: \"An assessment procedure should be established at the reception \ncenters to identify the various levels of need for control and treatment of each sex \noffender.\"  This document makes another 39 recommendations - most of which have \nnot been followed. \nWhat Is The Purpose of Assessment? \nAssessment is necessary to inform the treatment planning guidelines.  Moving forward \nwithout a treatment plan is like trying to guide a car with no headlights down a dark \ncountry road. \nThe only individualized treatment planning taking place in the California Youth \nAuthority presently is in the special programs.  These are not always sex offender \nspecific and may vary from institution to institution. As of 111104 there is a plan to \nimplement an individualized treatment plan for each ward.  This does not include sex \noffender specific treatment planning. \n22 \n\nJAN-22-2004  01:43  P.02/03 \nAssessment and evaluation fonn the basis for an individualized treatment plan, \nconsidered a fundamental and routine component of any sex offender treatment program_ \nTreatment planning requires analytical and critical thought about problem definition and \nthe choice oftherapeutic interventions objectively best suited for overcoming an \nindividual's specific problems. Treatment plans serve as a structured road map for the \nward, the treatment team, the family, the parole officer, the court and any others involved \nor with an interest in the treatment process.  It indicates the intennediary problems \nbetween the present state of the ward and the ultimate goals, what is going to be done to \novercome the problems, what progress is made toward achieving  treatment goals, and \nwho is responsible for planning and executing these interventions.  The treatment plan is \nstated in behavioral terms, with measurable objectives.  There is nothing vague about a \ntreatment plan, and as a result both the ward. therapists, program staff, and others \nconcerned are concentrating on the same specifically stated objectives and specified \ninterventions.  When the ward, treatment team, and anyone else involved in the case \nreviews this ('ian at regular intervals, it creates a benchmark of progress that ev~ryone \ncan understand.  . \nTreatment plans for sexually abusive/aggressive youth reflect not only the treatment \nissues that are typical for sexual abusers, but also foGUs on whatever unique collateral \ncharacteristics the individual may have.  Sometimes those collateral treatment issues may \nbe as important to preventing re-offending as the more generic oifens&-specific issues. \nHaving a treatment plan means that treatment is goal-oriented at all times, and the focus \nis kept on achieving that goal.  Discharge from treatment will be based on objectively \nmeasurable, behavioral progress toward objectives and goals. \nRecommendation; It is my understanding that the CYA   has recognized a need for \ntreatment plans that are individualized and began developing a model for this in January \n2003.  The CY A should also develop a treatment plan design that is offense specific but \ncan be individualized to meet the needs of the different wards.  The treatment plan should \nstate the goals and objectives and the interventions made to meet them as well as the \nindividual that is responsible for those interventionS: . It must be stared in behavioral \nterms and measurable objectives mid updated at regular intervals.  The ward, the \ntreatment team, the ward's tiunily if available should all be involved in creating the plan \nand in the periodic review of the plan. The plan is not static but a growing changing \ndocument. \n2.  Multimod21 Mnitidisc:iplinary Treatment Program: \nThe California Youth Authority has several separate and distinct sex: offender programs \nhoused in several different institutions.  These programs serve approximately twenty \npercent of the sexually abusive youth housed in the California Youth authority.  The \nprograms have operated autonomously and there has been no uniform plan fOT \nprogramming. \n23 \n\nA.  Treatment Modalities: It is a basic standard of practice for offense specific \ntreatment programs to offer a combination of treatment modalities in the context of a \ntherapeutic milieu.  The common modalities are: individual therapy~ family therapy; \ngroup therapy; deviant arousal reduction; sex education/sexual values; psycho \neducational groups; life coping- skills training; anger management training; conflict \nresolution and problem solving training; interpersonal skills training; communication \ntraining and! or therapy, assertiveness training; instruction in empathy building; \ninstruction in identifying and expressing feelings; social skills training; parenting \ntraining; and, therapies which focus on relapse prevention. \nIn order to understand how CYA   compares with the national averages regarding program \ncomponents and philosophies, we need to look at the data collected by the Safer Society \nFoundation, Inc in 2000 from 91 offense specific residential programs for male juveniles \n(Juvenile corrections 26.1%, acute care 7.6%, court sponsored 8.7%, group home 28.3%, \nhalfway house 2.2%).  The survey revealed that the most common treatment modalities \nand the average time spent on them per week were as follows: Individual Sessions: 1.27 \nhours; Group Sessions: 3.7 hours; and, Family Sessions .81 hours).  In contrast eYA \nprograms offer no individual sessions, 1-2 hours of group sessions per week, and no \nfamily sessions except on very rare occasions. \nThe Safer Society survey also revealed that many treatment programs involved offenders \nin community service (Sgolo), in contributing monetarily to victim treatment (29.3%), and \nin structured written apologies to victims (82%).  The eYA programs include community \nservice and contributions to victims, but do not have victim apology sessions. Victims \nand their families are invited to parole hearings, and are asked to share whatever they \nwant to.  The parole hearing that I attended was extremely well handled. According to the \nstaff at this facility, not all parole hearings are this professionally conducted. This \nparticular one was conducted by two astute and knowledgeable individuals. \nThe Safer Survey further found that relapse prevention was used by 94% of the treatment \nprograms, educational classes 89%, cognitive restructuring 89%, arousal reconditioning \n81%, adjunctive treatment 83%, and medications as specifically required 60%. Although \nall of these are offered, the deficits have to do with the amount of time devoted to each \nactivity, the amount of training of individuals delivering the activities, the competency of \nthose individuals, the validity of the resources and the number of sessions possible \nbecause of staffing problems.  This is riot to indicate that there are not some competent \nwell trained individuals providing very good treatment services but that it is not a \nstandard. \nA combination of the following educational or therapeutic activities were also typically \noffered: anger/aggression management, art therapies, drama therapies, experiential \ntherapies, (wilderness outings, ropes course, role plays, etc), relationship skills and \nphysiological monitoring, assault cycle, victim empathy (teaching to care about your own \nfeelings and those of others), sex education, victim restitution, and personal \nvictimization/trauma, assault cycle, victim clarification.  Anger/aggression management, \n24 \n\nrelationship skills, assault cycle, victim empathy and restitution, sex education, pers()nal \nvictimization/trauma, assault cycle, are all components that are offered.  The consistency, \nthe competency, the lack of updated materials is the deficits.  Art therapies, drama \ntherapies, and experiential therapies are not offered.  These therapies are not essential to a \nprogram but are thought to work particularly well with a population that has difficulty in \nexpression verbally and on a feeling level. \nAccreditation or licensure was achieved by 78% of the programs surveyed. This is not the \ncase with the CYA   programs for sexually abusive youth. \nB.  Family Involvement: At the present time the CYA  's involvement of the family in \nsex offender programs is. almost non existent with a few exceptions.  There is family \nvisitation on the weekend at all of the institutions, family night at Carter when there is \nstaff available, and on rare occasions family therapy.  At OH Close, three families \ninterviewed during one weekend visitation stated that they had never had any contact at \nall from the staff at the Humboldt sex offender program. All indicated that they would \nlike to have basic treatment information, and that they would be willing to be involved in \ntreatment if asked.  One family spoke no English and their son informed me that he was \nnot aware of any staff on the Humboldt program that spoke Spanish.  To be fair, the \npresent job responsibilities of the therapists at Humboldt do not allow opportunity for any \nfamily involvement, much less treatment, to be developed.  Besides an already \noverwhelming schedule, there are also systemic problems - such as the fact that at the \nHumboldt program three therapists share one phone line. \nThe development of a formal program for family involvement is extremely important. \nOften there are family dynamics which allowed, contributed, or supported the \ndevelopment of offending behavior and mentality. Identifying, interrupting and replacing \nthose patterns of behavior with patterns of behavior that support non-offending is a major \ngoal of family treatment.  It is not realistic for us to expect a youth to change or maintain \nchanges with a sabotaging or non-supportive family, particularly if the individual is to \nreturn to that family setting.  It is also no more realistic to expect the families of \ndischarged offenders to understand how to provide effective support and oversight, than \nit is to expect under-funded, unqualified and! or inadequately trained staff to do so prior \nto discharge. \"Treatment programs for juvenile sexual offenders must develop methods to \nhelp families look at and understand how their beliefs and values have influenced the \nbeliefs, behavior and relationship of their tum contributed to the sexually abusive \nbehavior of their child. (Barnes and Hughes, (2002)) \nIf there has been sibling incest, by and! or against the ward, then a specialized family \nreunification procedure must be followed, and social services involved, prior to any \ndecision to return the ward to the home upon discharge if the victim resides in the home. \nOffense specific family treatment services encompass a variety of options which can be \ntailored to a particular family and ward's needs.  Involvement in treatment may include \n25 \n\nfamily contracting, individual family therapy, multifamily therapy, psycho-educational or \nsupport groups, family working visits in the facility, visits monitored by the family \ntherapist, facility visitation, therapeutic home visitation during the pre-discharge stage, \nand the provision of a family information packet or manual. All of these components are \nnot necessary in order to have a successful family program but will offer program options \nwhich they can then utilize as they see fit. \nThe following research will help in understanding the issues that need to be addressed in \nfamily treatment: \no  Familial characteristics that are common include instability, disorganization and \nviolence (Bagley and Shewchuk-Dann (1991); Miner, Sieker, and Ackland \n(1997); Morenz and Becker (1995»). \no  Family characteristics discovered form a retrospective of 51 cases:  lack of sexual \nboundaries - 25%, presence of sexually explicit materials - 33%. \no  Miner, Siekert, and Ackland's (1997) study of incarcerated offenders revealed that \nonly 16 percent of incarcerated juveniles came from intact families. Rates do \nvary, however, in other stories. They also described the juvenile sex offenders in \ntheir sample as coming from \"chaotic\" family environments. \no  Communication styles in the families of sexually abusive youth tend to be \nnegative and non supportive. «Blaske, Borduin, Henggeler, and Mann, as cited in \nMorenz and Becker, (1995». \no  Smith and Israel (1987) found that some parents of juveniles who sexually abused \ntheir siblings were physically and/or emotionally inaccessible and distant. \no  Kobayashi et al. (1995) found that more positive relationships between juveniles \nand their mothers may be related to decreased levels of sexual aggression in \njuveniles. \no  Weinrott (1996) reported there is strong evidence that family instability and \nproblems in parent-child attachment in childhood are associated with more \nintrusive forms of juvenile sex offending. \no  \"The families of children who engaged in sexually aggressive behavior tended to \nbe characterized as dysfunctional, evidencing high rates of parental separation, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse, highly sexualized environments (e.g., \nexposing children to sexual activity, pornography, and both covert and overt \nsexual abuse), unsatisfactory role models, poor parent-child relationships, parental \nhistories of childhood abuse, and so on (Araj~ (1997». \no  'After review liThe evidence ... points to family interactions as a primary source \nof the problem\" (Araji, (1997». \nIt is not realistic to expect any individual to change or maintain changes with a \nsabotaging or non-supportive family, if the individual is to return to that family setting or \neven remain in close contact with their families. Even if the individual is not to return to \nthe family setting the unresolved issues of past family dynamics must have closure of \nsome kind.  \"Family therapy facilitates the learning of new ways of communicating and \nbuilding a support system, which will help interrupt the abuse cycle and ultimately be \n26 \n\nsupportive to the offenders' capacity for resulting and modulating aggressive sexual \nbehavior.\"  (Bernet and Duncan, (1999». \nStill, some people have a problem understanding the correlation between family \ninvolvement and success in treatment.  In a conversation that will never be forgotten, a \nprogram administrator in Tennessee complained to me, \"I don't understand why juveniles \nleave here doing really well, go home to their families, and then everything that we have \ndone falls apart\".  This program, of course, provided no family treatment. \nRecommendation: \"Families should be involved in all aspects of intervention \nbeginning with the assessment process\" (Moreno and Becker, 1995).  The CYA   should \nconduct a needs assessment to ascertain how many wards will be going home, how many \nwill be returning to a home that contains the siblings that they abused, how many families \nwould be willing to be involved in treatment, as well as  other important information that \nmight be important to know if planning a family treatment program.  After this \ninformation is obtained, then a family treatment program can be developed that meets the \nneeds of the wards as well as the limitations of any particular institution.  It is obvious \nfrom what we know about the families of these youth, and the important role that families \nplay in their lives, that we must attempt to involve the families in treatment.  It may mean \nthat the therapist has to spend some time engaging the family members, as many families \nare reluctant to participate because of their shame and humiliation about the crime.  As \nStevenson and Wimberley (1990) said, \"The importance of family influences in the life \nof the adolescent sex offender cannot be underestimated as it is often the barometer of \nwhat can or cannot happen in treatment\" \nC.  Substance Abuse Interventions:  The CYA   has a limited amount of substance \nabuse programs and it is not unusual for there to be a waiting period for space. \nSubstance abuse assessments are regularly conducted but it has not been the practice to \nevaluate substance abuse in the context of sexual offending or for its impact on sexual \noffending. Yet, as Lightfoot and Barbaree (1993) have suggested, assessments of \njuveniles who have committed sex offenses would do better to determine not simply \nwhether substance abuse is present in a juvenile'S life but whether it is a risk factor for \noffending. If it is found to be a risk factor, the next step is to evaluate what interventions \nare required to reduce this risk. \nWithout an adequate assessment of substance abuse problems there is no way to \ndifferentiate between substance abuse problems that are \"normative\" experimentation, \nsubstance abuse that is a real addictive problem and substance abuse that is a risk factor \nfor sexual offending. . Even among adolescents who are infrequent substance abusers, \nissues such as poor impulse controL problem-solving difficulties, and poor social skills \ncan be exacerbated by even small amounts of substance and, consequently, may increase \nthe risk of sexually abusing (Lightfoot and Barbaree, (1993».  They also suggested that \nless frequent users may benefit from substance abuse treatment efforts that are part of a \n27 \n\n,.. \n.,. \nP.03/03 \nJAN-22-2004  01:43 \n:: \n... \n..  comprehensive treatment program., but more chronic users may require intensive \nsubstance abuse treatment efforts, possibly prior to treatment related to sex. offending_ \n.. \nBecker and Stein (as cited in Hunter and Becker, 1994) found that although 62 percent of \n... \nthe juvenile sex offenders in their study admitted to alcohol use, only 11 percent reponed \n...  that alcohol use increased their sexual arousal. Statistical analyses indicated that the \njuveniles who reported increased arousal had more victims than those who said alcohol \n... \nhad no effect on their arousal or who said they did not drink. Illicit drug use was less \n... \ncommonly reponed than alcohol use among these juveniles: 39 percent reponed illicit \n...  drug use. Of these, approximately 23 percent reported that it increased their sexual \n...  arousal \n... \n..  Recommendation: The CYA   should assess substance abuse problems in the \ncontext of sexual offending for ·all sexually abusive youth.  Assessments have been \n...  developed that can differentiate between infrequent. experimenta~ recreational. and \nchronic: u~rs and between different types of life problems assoqiated with substance \n..  abuse among juvenile offenders. (Lightfoot. Lightfoot, and Hodgins, as cited in.Lightfoot \n- \nand Barbaree, (1993». Part ofindividuaJ treatment planning should be determining the \ninterventions that are appropriate for each type of substance abWie problem as well as it's \ncorrelation to the sexually abusive behavior.  . \n... \nlilt \n...  Even the wards know that substance abuse intervention is important.  Listen to the words \n.....   of two different wards, \"I needs a drug program but no beds are available\", and\" I can't \ndo no good on the drug program because I can't read\" . \n-~-  D.  Deviant Sexual Interests: In their sample of 197 juvenile sex offenders, Schram, \nMilloy, and Rowe (1991) found that sexual recidivists, defined as juveniles arrested for a \n..-..-.   new offense, were Significantly more likely than other offenders to have deviant patterns \nof sexual arousal. This is an issue that is most important fOT the CY A to address . \nAt this time The California Youth Anthority h~··no way to assess a ward's degree of \ndeviant arousal except for self-repon:.  There is also no policy and procedure and no \n~ \n.-. .  protocol for the reduction of deviant arousal if it is present.  Individual therapists \nsometimes use acceptable arousal-reconditioning methods with a select few clients but \n... \nthis tends to be a result of the available time as well which psychologists have training in \nthis area . \n- \n'\"  Recommendation:  The CY A should identify a protocol for assessing sexual interest \n--\nand for intervening in interrupting that arousal pattern.  When sexual arousaJ is present, \nits control or management is a priority.  The Sex Offender Work Plan makes some \n-\" \nsuggestions about how to do this and these will receive comments in Question Six. \n... \nl!I\\ \n'\" \n.. \n... \n~ \n28 \n\nG.  Therapeutic Community or Culture:  Placement in a sex offense specific \nresidential setting means two things: an individual poses an unacceptable risk to others \nand to themselves in the community, and successful rehabilitation will require the \ntemporary restructuring ofhis/her world experience from the ground up.  In other words, \nin order to be effective, residential treatment must be more than outpatient treatment in a \nsocially controlled and isolated facility.  The total treatment environment must be an \nintegration of all of the components so that for twenty-four hours a day there is constant \nopportunities to apply therapeutic interventions and newly learned skills. \nFor this reason, the standard of practice for residential programs is the development of a \ntherapeutic community, sometimes called a therapeutic milieu or an abuse specific \nmilieu.  This kind of community is carefully designed to support positive, prosocial \nbehavior, and to decrease negative, antisocial behavior.  In the case of sexual offending, \nthis also means to support non-offending behavior and to confront offending behavior. \nIn offense specific treatment everything in the environment must be designed to alter and \nchange those characteristics that support offending behavior and encourage those \ncharacteristics that are necessary for non-offending behavior.  This offense specific \napproach means that treatment takes place continuously on a 2417 basis - thus the impact \nof the therapeutic community. \n\" ... It is essential that staff, administrators, and members of the governing authority \nunderstand that the special needs of sexually abusive/ aggressive youth must be \naddressed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  This means that the total environment of \nany residential program is offense-specific.  The ways in which the residents interact \ndaily with others, relate to authority figures, and deal with their feelings present \nopportunities for staff to address abusive dynamics in the context of daily living.\" \nStandard 22,  \"Standards of Care for Youth in Sex Offense Specific Residential \nPrograms\" (J 998) \nThe CY A, instead of developing a therapeutic culture, has allowed a counter-productive \nprison culture to develop. This culture is reactive rather than proactive, and punitive \nrather than educational.  In some cases it has become an us against them culture.  It is a \nculture that doesn't allow adolescents to act like adolescents but treats what for most \nparents is simply annoying, irritating, obnoxious teenage developmental behavior as \ncriminal behavior. \nRecommendation:  The CYA   should continue to move as rapidly as possible toward \na treatment or rehabilitation model and plan opportunities for rehabilitation 2417.  This \nhas many advantages, just one of them a decrease in treatment time and increase in \ntreatment effectiveness.  Minnesota has mandated this: \nChapter 2955 of the Minnesota rules, Minnesota Department of Corrections is as follows: \n2955.0020 subpart 31 Therapeutic Milieu.  \"Therapeutic milieu means the planned and \ncontrolled use of the program environment and components as part of the treatment \nregiment to foster and support desired behavioral and' cognitive changes in clients.  A \n29 \n\ntherapeutic milieu functions to coordinate and integrate supervised group living and the \ndelivery of treatment services with other program components such as security, medical \nand psychiatric care, social services, nutrition, education, recreation, and spirituality.  The \nnature and degree of development of a therapeutic milieu in the program may vary, \ndepending upon the certificate holder's basic treatment protocol and the environmental \nand other conciliations in which the program operates.\" \nH.  Psycho educational Groups:  Psycho educational groups about the issues typical for \nsexually abusive youth - anger management, impulse control, life coping skills, healthy \nsexuality, etc - are being offered but usually it depends on staffbeing available or staff \nbeing trained.  The materials are copied from a wide variety of materials copied by \nprogram staff that are all appropriate but that are not offered in any consistent materials. \nL  Behavior Management within a Therapeutic Milieu:  Residential treatment must \nbegin by providing a safe environment.  This is necessary before any treatment takes \nplace and is an essential pan of treatment as well. It is well known that the relationship \nwithin which behavior management takes place is critical to its effectiveness with \nadolescents. When youth use aggression, manipulation, power, or control it is usually a \ndefense mechanism in order to establish their invulnerability and maintain safety or \nperhaps in some cases - typical adolescent developmental behavior.  Through \nrelationships adolescents learn to modify their view of the world as unsafe and unfair, \nlearn to tolerate closeness, experience compassion and empathy (which must happen \nbefore they can demonstrate it to others), learn self discipline, values, and responsibility, \nlearn to give and take, and to practice pro-social values. \nThere are individuals who see this kind of approach as a soft one.  Anyone who chooses \nto act out of an internalized value system rath~r than react to the circumstances around \nthem knows that this is not true. Self discipline is the toughest kind of discipline. Rules, \nstructure and consequences are certainly important, however, unsocialized youth become \nsocialized through relationships.  The end result is self-discipline, which is really the only \neffective kind. \nEffective behavior management is based on discipline.  Punishment is typically what a \nfrustrated adult does to an adolescent to decrease the adult's feeling of frustration.  It is \nrarely effective as a means of instilling values or lasting change.  Discipline, on the other \nhand, is often direct feedback from the environment that signals to the youth that his \nchoice was a bad one and that this approach will keep him or her in prison environments. \nAnyone who has ever received a speeding ticket understands what consequences and \ndiscipline are all about, as well as the fact that the close supervision of the officer was \nnecessary for speeding to be detected. The attitude of the officer as well as the logical \nconsequences imposed effects our acceptance of this corrective action ... \nBehavioral interventions are opportunities for teaching to take place.  Many young people \neven prefer punishment to discipline because it is over and done with quickly and is less \n30 \n\n._-_._-----\npainful than what it takes to learn to do differently.  As one guard reported, ''the wards \nprefer to be maced, it's painful for a little while and then it's over and done with.\" Or as \nanother said, \"I like to be maced, it feels good to hurt\", and another, \"I like to see if I can \npush them so hard that they will lose it.\" \nSome of the behavior management strategies being used at this time are not conducive to \nchanging behavior but are even counter productive for a sex offender program.  For \nexample, it makes little sense to utilize room restriction or isolation as a consequence for \nindividuals who prefer to withdraw and avoid personal interactions.  In fact, room \nrestriction or any other kind of isolation allows sex offenders opportunities to fantasize \nabout deviant sexual behavior and make plans for that behavior.  The fact is that sex \noffenders need to be kept very busy, not stagnant. \nCurrently there is a sharp division between security and treatment services. This is often \nthe case when juvenile facilities are organized after an adult correctional model. \nIn juvenile facilities organized this way, a significant number of the adults are designated \nas \"security\" or \"correctional\" officers whose responsibilities are often limited to giving \norders and enforcing them through disciplinary sanctions, threats and physical force. \nAlthough these are the adults with whom the juveniles spend the most time, they often do \nnot, and are not expected, to be involved in the rehabilitative treatment of the juvenile. \nInstead, other professionals provide rehabilitative treatment in discrete doses in much the \nsame way medical treatment is dispensed. \nSuch tactics are especially prone to abuse when staff is not adequately trained in the \ndifferences between adult and adolescent behavior. We know that juveniles, more than \nadults, are prone to defiance and disobedience that can be addressed through verbal \ninterventions. But officers trained in adult prison practices, or who come from a \nbackground of adult corrections, use rational correctional responses and don't get the \ndesired results.  When this happens then they just use the traditional methods more so. \nWhen staff are not trained to work with adolescents or not supervised closely enough, \nthey can respond to non compliant adolescent behavior as if it were criminal behavior. \nWhen obnoxious, irritating and rebellious adolescent behavior is responded to with \nthreats and force, and minor incidents get escalated. \nThe security staff, not trained in the processes for dealing with adolescents, \nAlso know little or nothing about the treatment needs or plans for the juveniles under \ntheir watch, and they are unable to take advantage of the numerous daily opportunities \npresented for confronting maladaptive adolescent behaviors in a way that transforms \ninstances of conflict into opportunities for self-reflection and learning. The use of \nextended isolation as a method of behavior control, for example, is an import from the \nadult system that has proven both harmful and counterproductive when applied to \njuveniles. It too often leads to increased incidents of depression and self-mutilation \namong isolated juveniles, while also exacerbates their behavior problems. Research has \nshown that the use of prolonged isolation leads to increase not decreased, acting out, \nparticularly among juveniles with mental illness.  For sex offenders it is one of the high-\n31 \n\nrisk behaviors that they must avoid.  It is boredom that is sometimes a precursor of the \ndeviant fantasies that lead to sexual behavior. \nMace is one of the current methods of behavior control.  Although the intent is to use \nmace when a ward is a threat to self or others (and I question its use even here), mace is \nresorted to quickly in many other situations. The following information comes from \ndocumentation, interviews with staff and wards: \nMace was used for these reasons: refusing to follow instructions, distracting staff \nin the performance of their duties, masturbating so that female staff would see, \nkicking their door, refusing to follow directions, etc.  Many of the staff likes the \nuse of mace - it's quick and easy.  One ward even reported the following: \"I like \nto be maced cause I like to feel pain.  Once my mouth and eye burned for a long \ntime afterward.\" \nThreatened with mace:  ward with acne cream was told to drop cream to the floor \nor be maced. \nBehavior management reports for made for the following: holding hands with another \nward refusing to go to school, profanity, racial slurs, being disruptive, passing items, \nrefusal to go to school, not bringing laundry out at the assigned time, not keeping silence, \nlooking in a room after being told not to, to name a few. On one occasion a ward was \nwritten up for failing to attend a class that she told the staff that she did not have. She \nappealed this ruling and appeal was granted. \nThe above situations are either treatment issues or typical adolescent behavior. These \nsituations are opportunities to teach wards new and more functiomil ways of behavior. \nOf course, teaching doesn't mean that discipline or consequences do not take place as \nthese two go hand in hand.  As one staff member said, \"Lots of misunderstandings \nbetween wards and staff lead to arguments.  If staff were properly trained they would \nknow how to avoid those.\"  There is no reason to argue if your purpose is to teach. \nIt is counter therapeutic to use authoritarian or abusive language or behavior with \nsexually abusive youth.  We are trying to teach wards to be non abusive - how to change \ntheir abusive behaviors.  They are familiar with abuse.  As one ward at Preston reported -\n\"the staff doesn't respect you unless they are scared of you so I just make sure that they \nare scared of me.\"  And another at Carter, \"they are first prison guards and then treatment \nstaff\". \nRecommendation:  The CYA   should take positive and proactive steps to change \nfrom an institutional and punitive model to a teaching and rehabilitative model.  In a \nteaching model, all staff are teachers and role models. Institutions lock children in at \nnight and they don't supervise them.  Institutions have a minimum of staff and a \nmaximum of children. Institutions warehouse young people in a sterile environment, \nwhich depersonalizes and dehumanizes them, and at best will teach them to behave \nwhile in the program. At the worst it encourages rebellion and teaches anti social \n32 \n\nbehavior.  What institutions don't do is provide remotely effective treatment or adequate \nsupervision for a population as complex and unique as sexually abusive and/or offending \nyouth.  There is no opportunity to change, or to learn how to develop healthy and normal \nrelationships when incarcerated in an institution with an institutional mentality. \nThe CYA is not unaware of the need to be rehabilitative rather than punitive.  In fact they \nare making active efforts to change that culture.  However, on many occasions staff told \nof the difficulties in trying to carry this out.  One cautionary and very strong memo bears \nthis out: \n\"Because it can utterly destroy the program, even slight abuse of an inmate, verbal \nor physical will not be tolerated.  Our pwpose is to foster respect, not fear.  We \nwill structure everything we say so as to generate a perception of fairness, purpose \nand respect.  We can permit no profanity directed towards inmates.  We will not \nbe able to teach self-control, respect, courtesy, and good manners if we fail to \ndemonstrate these qualities ourselves.\"(See also the CYA  's Standard Operating \nProcedure Manual for the LEAD program's stan: who is called TAC officers \n(For Teach, Advise, and Counsel)). \nL  Systems Integration:  The Importance of All of the Expert Reports in Reference \nto Sexually Offending Programs:  Normally the areas of behavior management, \neducation, mental health, and vocational training, would be thoroughly covered in a sex \noffender specific evaluation. These areas are always integrated into the program design in \nsuch a way that they support the offense specific treatment issues.  However, as other \nexperts were assessing these areas, then their fmdings can be factored into the assessment \nof the sex offender program.  With that in mind, those areas will be covered in \nrelationship to their impact on sex offender specific treatment and the other reports will \nanswer the questions of overall adequacy.  Are these areas supportive or non-supportive \nof sex offender treatment or not, is the question to be answered. \nCurrently the interventions utilized for behavioral management, educational, mental \nhealth, medical, vocational, and substance abuse issues are considered as separate and \ndistinct from sex offender specific treatment, and are not treated as an integral part of \nthose treatment programs. Failing to understand the importance ofa cohesive, \ncollaborative therapeutic milieu, education, mental health; medical and vocational \nprograms are not considered components of a sex offender treatment program, but \nparallel, separate services.  The integration of all of these components into sex offender \ntreatment is essential, and the reasons are logical.  Sexually abusive behavior does not \nhappen in isolation, it happens within a personal and social context.  So, too is teaching \nan offender how to change, though this job is harder. Therefore the importance of taking \nadvantage of all the interwoven aspects ofajuvenile's life and learning. \nDespite its complexity, an effective juvenile sexual offender treatment program in which \nall parts are integrated costs no more to implement and run compared to what it saves, \nwithin as well as without the prison walls.  Taken overall, poorly designed treatment \nprograms are a constant and ongoing drain on financial resources.  Also, some ill \n33 \n\nconceived treatment programs even have the possibility of strengthening deviant \nbehavioral habits and mental patterns (and thereby increase the costs associated with \nmore problematic offenders). \nRecommendation:  The CYA   should design programs to be comprehensive by \nintegrate all components of a program into a cohesive model. \n•  Educational System:  The impact of the educational system on the sex offender \nprogram been is not being considered.  The teachers are not trained in working with \nsexually abusive youth, and so do not know how to confront abusive behavior, redirect \nsexualized behavior, or to keep their classrooms safe.  They do not have any part in their \ntreatment planning and are not kept informed about the progress or lack of progress of the \nyouth in treatment. As a result treatment staff misses valuable input and educational staff \nmisses being informed about interventions that would be helpful in the classroom. In \nsome programs a personal relationship has developed between the members of the sex \noffender treatment team and the educational staff  In other cases sexual harassment nas \nbeen a frequent occurrence. Although I did not see this myself, I was told by facility staff \nthat some wards are so dangerous that they are put in cages in the classroom.  The \nturnover in the educational staff is high.  The integration of the educational programs and \nspecially trained educators are not just options; they are basic components of successful \njuvenile sex offender treatment programs.  Although there are extra short term costs ere, \nthey are investments which soon pay for themselves in literal, observable, even \nsometimes quantifiable ways. Short term knee jerk reactions do not. \nThere are several reasons why the role of education is so important.  First, we have \nextensive information about the special educational deficits of sexually abusive youth. \nResearch on juvenile delinquents by Ferrara and McDonald (1996) has noted two areas of \nimpairment with sexual offenders: difficulties with executive functions, such as planning, \nabstraction, inhibition of inappropriate impulses, and cognitive flexibility; and difficulties \nwith receptive and expressive language.  A review of the literature leads them also to \nconclude that between one-quarter and one-third ofj uvenile sex offenders might have \nsome form of neurological impairment.  To quote: \"Furthermore, it is likely that the \nneurologically impaired juvenile sex offender who goes undetected will not attain the \n[optimal] benefit from treatment due to problems in concentration, comprehension, and \nmemory\" \nIn addition we know the following about juvenile sex offenders and their educational \nneeds: \n•  Kahn and Chambers found that more than half of the juveniles in their study of \nsexually abusive youth had evidenced at least one of three kinds of difficulty at \nschool: disruptive behavior (53 percent), truancy (nearly 30 percent), or a learning \ndisability (39 percent). \n•  As part of an investigation of learning difficulties as a potential factor in sex \noffender treatment, Langevin, Marentette, and Rosati (1996) found that 53 percent \nof the subjects apparently experienced learning difficulties during childhood. 38 \n34 \n\npercent had been placed in special classes, and 14 percent were diagnosed as \nmentally retarded. \n•  Intellectual and cognitive impairments are very important factors that should be \naddressed in sex offender treatment. (Aw  ad, Saunders, and Levene, as cited in \nKnight and Prentky, 1993; McCurry et al., (1998». \n•  Violent juvenile sex offenders tended to have lower IQ scores than nonviolent sex \noffenders, which raise the question if this could be attributed to higher rates of \nneurological impairments among violent offenders.  Saunders et al. (as cited in \nFerrara and McDonald, (1996». \n•  Verbal deficits were associated with higher rates of aggression and antisocial \nbehavior for juveniles who fell within the normal range of intelligence.  Deficits \nin verbal cognitive functioning, reflected by impulsivity and poor judgment, \nmight contribute to the increased rates of serious inappropriate sexual behaviors \namong these juveniles. (McCurry et al.(1998». \n•  A closer examination, based on normative data, revealed that more than expected \nfell within the borderline range of intellectual functioning (i.e., IQ of 70-79), \nfewer than expected were within the \"bright normal\" range (IQ of 110-119), and \nmore than expected fell within the very superior range (i.e., IQ of 130-140). \nSecond, the most sexually abusive behavior is part of a cycle of behavior that may take \na \nplace within a couple of hours or  couple of months or longer.  This cycle does not \nhappen in a vacuum.  The cycle is part of the wards daily existence.  The opportunity to \nintervene, and redirect that cycle happens throughout the day - not just when the wards \nare out of school.  Sexually abusive behavior issues must be addressed on a 2417 basis. \nExperience has taught us that sexually abusive youth will act out in places where they are \nmost likely not to be detected - and school can be one of these places if it is not part of \nthe intervention program and if the staff is not well trained to handle this.  This can put \nother youth as well as teachers at risk \nThird, it is important for the safety of both the teaching staff and the wards that the \neducational staff' and the educational system know how to handle sexual behaviors and \nissues. Instances of sexual harassIDent often occur in the classroom where teachers are \nnot trained to intervene.  In addition, the possibility of real boundary issues occurs when \nadults do not understand interpersonal relationships with sexual offenders as well as the \ndynamics of sexual offender's behavior. \nIn addition, wards are in the classroom for a significant part of the day and teachers are \nvery influential.  For this reason it is necessary that the school personnel be trained in \nworking with sexually abusive youth and be an active part of the multidisciplinary \ntreatment team in treatment planning. This means that teachers are trained in working \nwith this population, know how to respond to them, know what their special needs are \nand participate fully in tre3tment planning. This is difficult to do when the teaching staff \n35 \n\nhas to try to focus on a number of youth with a variety of problems and do not have the \ntraining and skills to intervene with one very special population. \nAnd finally, an important aspect of the teachers work with sexually abusive youth is to \nprepare them to return to public schools.  All the reasons why it is unsafe and destructive \nto treatment to sendjuvenile sexual offenders into general public school populations \nbefore they are ready are enormously magnified when the general school population is \nalso a general prison population.  Particularly a general prison population likes that of \nmost CYA   facilities, which are increasingly dominated by juveniles with violent and! or \ngang related behavior.  Until the resident has progressed to a certain point in his treatment \nand is mentally and behaviorally prepared for a mainstream educational environment, \nhowever, the youth should be educated within the facility by teachers with sex-offender \nspecific training who work closely with the treatment team.  . \nRecommendation:  The CYA should involve the educational staffin sex offender \nspecific treatment and provide them with offense specific training. Juvenile sex offenders \nwith learning disabilities must be provided special education services to enable them to \nbenefit from educational services, juveniles with cognitive disabilities may require \nspecial assistance to benefit from substance abuse programming, youths with severe \nattention deficit disorder may require accommodations in facility rules to prevent their \ndisability from resulting in disciplinary sanctions.  Without this it is likely that active \nparticipation is a program for sexually abusive wards will be difficult. \n•  Vocational Training:  The Youth Authority has some excellent vocational \nprograms.  I particularly enjoyed the benefits ofthe culinary program at Preston, the \ngrounds program at other institutions and was very impressed when learning about the \nfire brigade program.  Unfortunately these programs are not open to sex offenders except \nfor rare exceptions.  This is unfortunate, as part of long-term success with these wards \nwill depend on whether or not they have the skills to support themselves in the real \nworld.  Besides being able to support themselves, a secondary gain of having vocational \nskills is the self-esteem that is developed as a result.  This was obvious in the faces of the \nyouth I saw involved in work programs and in the enthusiasm about them. \nRecommendation:  The CYA should make sure that all wards in the sex offender \nprograms have some kind of vocational training that increases in complexity, as the \nwards grow older. \n•  Medical Issues: There are two reasons why attention to the medical program is \nimportant for sexually abusive youth. First, there is data that suggests that juvenile sex \noffenders have many physical complaints, some of them somatic in nature and some of \nthem real.  Part of treatment is learning to differentiate between what is a real medical \ncomplaint and what is somatic in origin so that they can be dealt with in different ways. \nSomatic complaints, for example, are very common in victims of abuse and are a way of \nexternalizing pain.  There is also no doubt that one cannot participate in any program \n36 \n\nwhen one is in real or imagined physical pain or when one has a physical deficits that \nkeeps one from doing so. \nSecondly, co occurring disorders are not uncommon with sex offenders.  Ift hese are \naccurately diagnosed and assessed it is possible that the prescription of medication will \ngive wards the opportunity to respond to the sex offender program.  For wards with \nsevere ADHD, impulsivity and depression - to name a few disorders - it is not often not \npossible to do this without medication. \nRecommendation:  The CYA should consult with some of the medical experts who \nwork with sexually abusive youth to develop a medical protocol that takes the specific \nneeds of sexually abusive youth into consideration. \n•  Mental Health: \"When viewed in the context of the whole life experience and \nfunctioning,  sexually  abusive  behavior  is  often  present  in  combination  with  other \nemotional, psychiatric, and or behavior dysfunctions and have important implications in \nthe treatment of juveniles who are sexually abusive.  Some of these co existing disorders \nmay even impede the juvenile'S ability to successfully participate and progress in offense \nspecific treatment and  may require stabilization before entry into an offense specific \nprogram.\" (The National Task Force Report, (1993» \nHere's what we know about sexually abusive youth and mental health problems: \n•  Sexually aggressive youth who were placed in residential treatment centers had \nhigher rates of \"emotional disturbance\" than youth in general who were placed in \nresidential treatment centers (Becker, (1996». \n•  When compared with age matched control group of youth in residential treatment \nfor other problems sexually abusive youth had higher rates of hyperactivity or \nrestlessness, depression and anxiety, fire setting, encopresis, running away, early \nonset of neurological conditions or illness, learning disorders and health problems \n(Bagley and Schewchuk-Dann, (1991». \n•  Adolescents who sexually offend against younger children evidenced higher \nscored on the? Schizoid, Avoidant, and Depaent scales of the MCMI than those \nwho offended against peers.  Narcissism was significant in those that offended \nagainst peers (Carpenter, Peed, and Eastman (1996». \n•  Mental health co occurring disorders over represented are substance abuse, \nADHD, PTSD, OCD, affective disorders and learning disabilities (Ryan and \nLane, (1997), Miner, Siekert, and Ackland, (1997». \nWhatever the particular numbers, there is no reason to believe that there are fewer \nsexually abusive youth with mental health problems in the Califonia Youth Authority \nthan in the other correctional or residential systems.  It is clear from research data that a \nsizeable portion of youths with sexually abusive behaviors have significant mental health \nneeds. These youth may not be able to access offense specific treatment for just this \nreason. \n37 \n\nFar too often, inadequately trained staff does not see that disobedience, defiance or even \nthreats can be an offshoot of mental illness. Staff responds with anger, discipline or even \nforce - even though other interventions could have defused the situation. In these kinds \nof circumstances, it is not helpful to punish a juvenile for behavior caused by mental \nillness. And it is not helpful to expect correctional officers to supervise juveniles who are \nmentally ill in appropriate ways if they have not been trained how to do so. \nMoreover, once a mental health need has been identified, it is not enough simply to have \na psychiatrist who rarely visits the facility prescribe psychotropic medications. \nProfessionals must be involved in providing individualized treatment and in considering \nwhat reasonable accommodations are necessary to pennit the juvenile to benefit from the \nservices offered at the facility. And, when adequate mental health care cannot be \nprovided at the facility, the system should provide alternative placements where it can be \nprovided. \nQuote from a staff member: \"Probably 90% of the sex offenders in the CYA   have a \ndiagnosable disorder.  It would be better and less risk to deal with kids with co morbid \nissues in one program\"  While this may be an exaggeration, the concept is certainly \nvalid. \nRecommendation:  The absence of adequate mental health services to the wards of \nthe California youth Authority has been the subject of several other audits.  The results of \nthose audits were recommendations that would change that situation. The CYA   should \ntake into consideration the particular meaning that this has for the sexually abusive wards \nand enter into consultation with those who are specialist at co occurring disorders with \njuvenile sex offenders. \n3. Discbarge/Aftercare Planning \nA.  Discharge planning:  Offense specific programs must have discharge criteria that are \nbased on the accomplishment of specific, measurable, objective, observable changes, and \non the client's demonstrated ability to apply these changes to real life situations. \nResearch studies indicate that the clinical judgment of professionals is not the best \nmethod for identifying discharge readiness or treatment success and for these reason \nobjective measures of change are necessary.  Completing program modules or workbooks \nis simply not adequate.  . \nThe California Youth Authority does not have a protocol for discharge planning. \nDischarge is currently based on wards responsiveness to the program, completion of \npaperwor~ reports of their behavior on the unit, and clinical judgment.  These are a part \nbut not the entirety of appropriately determining discharge readiness.  According to staff \nreports the extension oftime can be based on a ward's personality or adolescent behavior \npatterns rather than his criminal risk factors \n38 \n\nRecommendation:  The CYA   should develop a discharge protocol that is based on \nthe accomplishment of specific and measurable, objective, observable changes and on the \nward's demonstrated ability to apply these changes to real life situations. \nB.  Aftercare: \"It is important that adequate resources be available to promote a \nsuccessful transition.  In order to be effective, aftercare should be as integral a part of the \nrehabilitative process as the initial assessment and treatment.  It is the part of treatment \nthat most directly connects with the juvenile's future\" (National Adolescent Perpetrator \nTask Force Report, 1993». \nResearch indicates that the post- discharge environment is a powerful factor in \ndetermining the successful long-term adjustment of individuals who have completed \nsecure residential treatment programs. \nThere are four primary reasons that aftercare is a significant part of the treatment process: \nFirst, it encourages the individual to continue to use the tools he or she has learned to \nprevent sexually abusive behavior and focuses on strengthening continued behavior \nmanagement.  Second, it provides a clear-cut method for monitoring the individual's \nbehavior after discharge.  Third, it helps the individual transfer therapeutic gains to the \ncommunity setting while providing continued support and monitoring through a multi \nsystems model of agency cooperation and collaboration.  Finally, and most importantly, it \nprovides the support of an individualized and personal support system, generally referred \nto in the fields involved as a circle of support, a containment team, or a relapse \nprevention team. \nThe standards adopted by the State of Virginia, for example, include the following \nstatement on aftercare: \n\"The majority of juveniles who complete sex offender treatment at a juvenile \ncorrections center will require additional community based treatment. \nCommunity based treatment will allow the juvenile the opportunity to continue \naddressing issues identified at the JCC, as well as provides a supportive transition \ninto the community.\" \nThe CYA   does coordinate offense specific aftercare services with some county parole \noffices.  Some ofthese county parole offices even have officers trained in working with \nsexually abusive juvenile males, and will arrange for treatment services to continue while \na youth is on parole, making it a parole condition.  If this were mandated for every \nidentified sex offender ward upon discharge, it would serve as a very good aftercare \nmodel. \nRecommendation:  The CYA   should develop an even closer affiliation with \nprobation/parole departments, so that the transition to the community can be easier and \nsafer.  This would involve both collaboration and sharing of resources with every parole \noffice in California. \n39 \n\n-----_  _----\n.. - .... \n2.  Question Two: Does the California Youth Authority Have an Adequate Level of \nTraining to Implement its Sex Offender Treatment Programs? \nThese questions must be divided into three sections in order to be answered.  First, are \nappropriate staffhired, second, are the staffhired amendable to training and finally are \nthey currently receiving the optimal training for the job. \nA.  Are the appropriate staff hired, and are staff hired amenable to training? \nBefore discussing staiftraining itself: one must first address whether staff currently and \nin the past have been hired who possess, both personally and professionally, the qualities \nand characteristics recommended for those working in this complex and specialized field. \nEven intensive training will not produce all of those personal characteristics that can have \na positive effect on treatment, or decrease those which will have a negative impact. \nThere is ample research and professional literature that informs us of the importance of \nthe therapeutic relationship and its influence on both safety and the success of treatment \n(Lambert (1991); The NCYFCJ National Task Force Report (1993); National Sex Offense \nSpecific Standards for Residential Settings (1998); Blanchard, (1998); Marshall, et al \n(2001); etc.) .. \nThe importance of these kinds of staff considerations is not news to the CYA  , either at \nthe management or the program level.  During this review there were many comments \nmade about the fact that some staff were not interested in working with sexually abusive \nwards but were working in the program because they wanted a particular shift.  In the \ncurrent system, in a plan negotiated by their union, a certain percentage of staff has to be \nhired because they have seniority and get to bid for positions. This method of hiring gives \nfirst choice to people regardless of their qualifications,- or lack of qualifications- to . \nperform in a highly specialized program. This is not to say that all of the staff hired under \nthe post and bid system are not qualified to do the work, or that all of the staff hired \noutside this system are qualified.  However, staffing is a critical element of juvenile sex \noffender treatment, and the CYA   needs to create and instal1 hiring policies which are \ndirected exclusively by industry certified staffing methods and the qualifications of \napplicants.  The union certainly has the right to promote job benefits for its members but \nnot at the expense of ward or public safety. When the post and bid decision was made, it \nis possible that the union simply did not know the importance of the kind of staff required \nfor work with sexually abusive youth. \nLack ofthe personal characteristics and qualifications to work with a sexually abusive \npopulation reflects in no way upon a person's overall quality or accomplishment with \nother populations.  Working with juvenile sexual offenders requires very specific \n40 \n\ncharacteristics, strengths, and types of experience.  Some mental health professionals who \nwork well with other juvenile populations are nevertheless unsuited to this field. \nIn a residential program everyone has a therapeutic influence on the individual's change \nprocess - direct care sta£I: guards and clinicians.  Although the therapist may be the \nmajor guide, all of the staff working as a team is integral to effective treatment.  At one of \nthe CYA   institutions a ward said, \"I've been here a year and only started to change in the \nlast two months.\" When asked what happened to bring about this change, he pointed to a \nyouth counselor and said, \"He's never given up on me\". This particular youth counselor \nhad been with CYA   for 14 years, and he possessed the very attributes we are discussing \nhere. Some of those attributes are: the ability to control without being controlling; a non \nsexist attitude and healthy sexual values; an ability to set limits and follow through on \nconsequences; an ability to use authority without abusing it; an ability to be comfortable \nwith one's own sexuality; to be comfortable talking to youth about sexual issues; and to \nbe able to work on changing sexually deviant behavior;  the ability to be trustworthy; to \nteach; to have a good sense of humor; to set good boundaries; to role model;  an ability to \nreject the behavior while caring for the person, an ability to withstand manipulation; an \nability to be fair; etc.  This is certainly not the whole list but will give you an idea of what \nwe are talking about. \nIt is not surprising that personal characteristics are so important, since staff dominate a \nward's psychological, social and physical environment.  As a result, anything a ward \nobserves or experiences of them consequently becomes a part of the treatment \nenvironment and process.  People in general and young people in particular are more \ninterested in what you do than what you say.  What's more, they will automatically tend \nto judge the worth of what you say by what you do.  Just as in life outside the prison, only \nmore so, wards will consider all staff's behavior, not just their formal interactions with \nthem.  As a group sexually abusive youth are master social observers.  If staff is not \nmodels of treatment's formal words and procedures the entire time they are on-site, the \nprogram's authority and the residents' motivation to internalize treatment concepts are \nsignificantly weakened. \nAs group juvenile sex offenders are also master's at spotting weaknesses, analyzing \nvulnerabilities, and manipUlating others to satisfy themselves.  As the most important \npeople in a resident's social environment, the one's controlling all his needs, desires, and \nsatisfactions, staffwill be the people a juvenile sex offender is most interested in \nobserving, understanding, and manipulating.  In many institutions in the past I have \nobserved staffbeing manipulated by juveniles who were unaware of the fact, and also \nwould have been deeply offended by the suggestion that they could be manipulated in \nany fashion by such youth. \nBeing a member of a sex offender specific treatment program's staff means accepting \nthat anything you do which is observable by anyone else on-site must model the \nobjectives of the treatment program.  Whether interacting with residents or other staff, or \nsimply going about daily duties, staff must be aware of what kind of coping skills, \nattitudes, anger management, etcetera, they are displaying.  It requires specific personal \n41 \n\ncharacteristics to accomplish this in a juvenile sex offender treatment environment. \nDuring an interview with a ward in the Oaks program I asked a ward if he thought the \nstaff on the Oaks was qualified to work with a sex offender population.  He replied, \n\"Right now, there is only one that isn't.  However, I haven't given up on her yet.\"  When \nI shared this comment with staff at the facility they immediately knew exactly who the \nward was referring to, and said that a lot of effort had been put into attempting to counsel \nthem.  Unfortunately, they also said that the unsuitable staff member was not amenable \nto change and that parties and policies outside the program were making it difficult to \nremove this person from the program.  This is' an unacceptable situation. \n\"In view of the individual needs and developmental histories ofj uvenile the \n\"quasi-rorrections model\" taken from the adult approach is not enough.  In some \nprograms staff seem to replicate the juvenile's power and control behaviors and \nsecretive behavior in the staff's own interactions among themselves and in their \ninteractions with the institutions managers, with other units and with the \njuveniles. The recommendation is that the staff in such programs for juveniles \nshould either be chosen or trained to enable them to serve as appropriate role \nmodels.\" (Goocher, (1998» \nRecommendation: The CYA should develop a protocol for hiring staff that takes into \nconsideration both the personal and professional qualities necessary to work with a \nsexually abusive population.  Any personnel responsible for staffing must themselves \nreceive specific training both in identifying potential staff with the optimal personal \ncharacteristics, and in identifying those individuals who have the potential to be sexually, \nphysically or emotionally abusive.  This training is readily available, and interviewing \ntechniques and the positive and negative characteristics to look for can be found in the \nprofessional literature and published research. After hiring has been accomplished, then \ntraining and close supervision will maintain the level of emotional and professional \ncompetency needed by all who interact with juvenile sex offender wards. \nB.  Staff Training:  After conducting numerous staff interviews and searching for \ntraining manuals, plans, schedules or any other kind of documentation, I couldn't find \nany evidence that there was regular and mandated offense specific training for staff I did \nnot review the records of any other kind of training considered necessary for each job \ndescription. \nThe almost total lack of offense specific training was one of the most common \ncomplaints heard, and they came from newcomers and staff who had worked in the CYA \nfor many years, alike.  One individual, who had worked on the CYA   sex offender \nprogram for four and a half years, said that he had received no pre-placement training and \na total of only six days of offense specific training since he was hired.  Another \ncommented, \"1 would like to stay with the department but there is not enough training \n42 \n\nand not enough programs ... the program really works when they have the time to put it in \nplace\" \nIn fact, the lack of offense specific training was so obvious that even some of the wards \ncommented on it. A ward at Humboldt said, \"Most staff doesn't have any formal training. \nI hear them complaining about it all the time.\"  A second said, \"Youth counselors just \naren't treatment-sharp\".  A group of eight youth interviewed at the Carter program all \nspoke of the fact that they were in group one hour a week - when it wasn't cancelled due \nto various crises.  They did have treatment-related homework to do, but only a few ofthe \nstaff had any understanding of the assignments so more often than not there was no one \nto ask for any help. \nReviewing documentation in the wards' charts in all programs, I found instances where \nthe staff missed cues or made judgment calls that could be contributed to lack of training \nand lack of supervision.  For example, someone had filled out a SORD that indicated the \nward was a high-risk sex offender.  Reviewing the chart I could find no evidence that this \nwas accurate.  The psychologist asked to also review the chart agreed.  The conclusion \nwas that although this staff (the one who filled out the SORD) was very competent in \ngeneral that they did not know how to accurately fill out the SORD.  This kind of mistake \ncould result in years of a ward being designated a high-risk sex offender who actually had \nno history of being a sex offender at all. \nThe difficulty and complexity of working with this population, the relative newness of \nthe discipline (20 years), and the number of dual diagnosis wards requires that staff \nreceive regular training provided according to a formal and continually updated and \ndocumented training plan.  Such training plans also provide the program as a whole with \nimportant accountability measures for any licensing or accreditation that may be sought, \nand for any litigation that might be faced.  Everyone \"\"ho has responsibility for the \nprogram or who will interact with the wards needs offense specific training in direct \nproportion to that person's interaction with the wards. \nThe time and resources spent on training are extremely cost-effective.  They payoff in \nmuch safer, more efficient and effective programs.  One of the issues that impacts \nstrongly on staff morale and turnover, as well as upon the efficiency and efficacy of a \nprogram, is inadequate training for working with the treatment population a staff is \nexpected to serve.  By enhancing job satisfaction for staff, rates of burnout and turnover \nare lowered, stabilizing and improving the operation of the program, and reducing \noperational costs to the State.  The most efficient programs are also the most successful \nprograms, reducing recidivism and therefore the financial and emotional costs to the \npublic of reoffending. \nMany States, including Indiana, Utah, Ohio, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington, have \nmandated sex offender treatment standards or established guidelines for sex offender \ntherapist qualifications which include on-going training requirements.  In some instances \ntherapists are required to be credentialed or certified in order to offer clinical services. In \nother instances a certain number of training hours are required for all staff working in a \n43 \n\nprogram.  The state of Arkansas, for example, requires that all staff that work directly \nwith this population have proof of completion of a professional certification program. \nOther states such as Kentucky and Ohio have developed two-week academic courses. \nRecommendation:  The CYA   should develop a mandated and comprehensive \noffense specific training program for all staff that includes detailed curricula for pre \nemployment and in-service training.  The program should include a monitoring system \nand a system for measuring the transfer of knowledge, as well as plans of correction for \nthose people who do not complete the training or who do not pass the transfer of \nknowledge examination.  There is even a number of pre-existing training programs \navailable that could be used as guidelines.  The CYA   should also develop a professional \nlending library at the central offices with current and updated professional resources that \ninstitutions could share as needed. \n3. Question Three:  Does the CYA Have the Level of Staffing Needed? \nStaffing levels at the CYA are not adequate for a population that requires high levels of \ninteraction and close supervision as part of the treatment program.  The CYA   and staff \nare more than aware of the shortages and the reasons for the need for more (appropriate) \nstaff: \n\"Some wards just can't get it, and some are so disruptive that they interfere with \nthe program.  There are kids here from 14 to 25 and many different J.cinds of kids \n- some need individual treatment, some need group, some need structure, some \ncan self structure.\" \nHere is an example of the staffing protocol for other state correctional facilities: \no  Minnesota has mandatory rules for the amount of staffing necessary in different \nlevels of programs.  For example a category one program is required to provide at \nleast one full time sex offender therapist counselor per eight clients but no less \nthan one therapist per 16 clients. The ratio of direct service staff to clients during \nwaking hours is 1 to 12; during non-waking hours there must be one present \nawake alert for every 24 individuals and a combination of staff resources to \nsupport that person. \nRecommendation:  The CY A should compare its ratio of staffing levels to other \ncorrectional systems who serve this population.  The standard of care is that the staffing \nlevel is dependent on the acuity level of the individuals served, the competency of the \nstaff, the number of years of employment, the environmental configuration of the unit, \nthe job responsibilities of the staff, the program design and delivery requirements and \nanything else that should be pertinent at any given moment. \n44 \n\n4.  Question Four: Does CYA   have Appropriate Policies and Procedures \nConcerning the Provision of Sex Offender Treatment? \nAt this time there is no policy and procedure manual for sex offender treatment. There are \nonly two policies that do apply to sex offenders - one is about the Sex Offender Referral \nDocument and the other is about the legislative mandate to treat certain sex offenders. \nThe sex offender work group has developed a sex offender program design and the next \nstep would be to develop policies and procedures for the implantation and delivery of that \nmodel. \nRecommendation:  The Sex Offender Work group along with the Central Office \nCoordinator should continue to work together to develop a complete policy and \nprocedure manual along with an implantation process. In some states law, along with \nlicensure by the state and an oversight committee, mandates the policies and procedures \nfor sex offender programs and I would recommend this for all states. \nThe Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice has a Sex Offender Services Procedure \nManual which was developed by the Treatment of Adolescent Sexual Offenders \nCommittee, a committee whose mission is to provide recommendations for sex offender \ntreatment programs, review and evaluate existing sex offender treatment, and recommend \ntraining needs for staffwho provide sex offender treatment in Virginia. \n5.  Question Five: Thoughts and Recommendations on the CYA's Transition from a \nProgram Model to a Case Management Model- Vision and Implementation. \nA program model is much more suited to juvenile sex offenders than a case management \nmodel.  Juvenile sex offender treatment depends on a strong peer group culture, a strong \ntreatment team approach, a therapeutic environment, and very focused treatment.  While \ncase management may work for other populations - and I am not convinced of that - it \nwill not work for this population or this kind of program. \n6.  Question Six:  Thoughts and Recommendations on eVA's Sex Offender \nTreatment Work Group Proposals. \nIn October 2002, the CYA   appointed a sex offender treatment work group and charged \nthem with designing a sex offender program that would meet minimum standards of \npractice in the field.  The temporary position of program coordinator was added to the \ncentral office staff to oversee and coordinate the project.  The expectations were that the \nwork group would accomplish the following goals: \n•  Standardize all sex offender treatment programs and curriculum in institutions and \nparole \n45 \n\n-----\n-------------\n•  Standardize sex offender treatment modalities and determine the most appropriate \ntreatment plans for various classifications of sex offenders \n•  Maximize sex offender treatment resources in institutions and parole \n•  Develop an outpatient sex offender program cubiculum \n•  Develop performance standards for sex offender treatment \n•  Review best practices nationwide in sex offender intake, classification and \ntreatment modalities \nIn May of2003 the plan was completed and approximately 300 individuals from the \nresidential sex offender programs, the Intensive Counseling Programs, and the \nSpecialized counseling programs were trained in an overview of the program and in the \nuse of the Sex Offender Referral Document.  Approximately 150 individuals received the \ntraining on the implementation of the work plan.  These included superintendents, \nassistant superintendents, program administrators, parole agent one and three, supervising \ncasework specialists, casework specialists, youth correctional counselors and \npsychologists. \nIn July a budget request proposal was submitted that would provide the funds to \nimplement the plan in its entirety. \nReviewer Comments: The result of these efforts was the creation of a plan for sex \noffender programs that is a commendable work by a group of talented professionals. \nThere are some weaknesses in the plan which will be reviewed along with the steps \nnecessary to correct those deficits. \nOne of the problems that continue to face the CYA   is the expectation that successful \nprograms can be developed and implemented without the necessary funding to do so. \nWhen an organizational system lives in this kind of a culture, it will eventually affect \neveryone, albeit in different ways. These are some of the typical comments of the staff: \n\"They ask us to be realistic about what is possible, are they saying hot water is \nunrealistic?\" \"There's no use asking for that, it just won't happen\", \"We have to make do \nwith what we have\", \"we are just so beaten down and don't' expect anything to change\"; \n\"that used to be in the budget, but it's been cut\"; we don't have the budget to fix the \nheating system\".  The pessimism is ingrained and seems entirely reasonable considering \nthese experiences.  Yet there are also those individuals that remain extremely \ndetermined, \"We have to keep fighting for what is right because we are responsible for \nthe rehabilitation of these kids and that's too important to give up on.\" \nRecommendation: The CYA should keep the Coordinator of the Sex Offender Work \nGroup and the Work Group functioning to develop policies and procedures,  program \ncomponents and evaluate the ongoing standard of the program against national standards. \nFunding to do this will be a necessity. \n46 \n\nComponents of the CYA   Sex Offender Program Plan May 2003: \nSex Offender Treatment Program Coordinator:  The Work Group Plan calls for a Sex \nOffender Treatment Program Coordinator, housed in the Central Office in the Institutions \nand Camps Mental Health unit.  These are the responsibilities suggested for that position: \n1.  Oversee all movement to and from the Residential and Outpatient Sex Offender \nPrograms. \n2.  Ensure that  each Residential  Sex  Offender Treatment Program has  an  equal \nnumber of lower functioning wards,  and will ensure that the ages and mental \nsophistication  of the  wards  are  appropriate  to the  particular  services  of the \ninstitutions to which they are directed. \n3.  Monitor the number of wards in the outpatient programs and attempt to equalize \nthese numbers according to the institutions' available resources. \n4.  Monitor the consistency and quality of the Sex Offender Treatment Programs. \n5.  Assist the program staff in their efforts to continually improve th~ quality of sex \noffender treatment. \n6.  Plan  and  oversee  the  sex  offender  trammg  (both  departmental  and \noutside/professional) for all staff in the sex offender programs. \n7.  :Manage the portion of the training budget specific to sex offender treatment. \n8.  Monitor ongoing research with the Research Department for best practices. \nReviewers Comments: A person at the central office level is critical in order to develop, \ncoordinate, and see to the implementation of this plan.  Without this I doubt any plan can \nbe accomplished. \nRecommendation:  The CY A should fund a permanent position at the Central Office to \ncarry out the above job responsibilities as well as the other job responsibilities suggested \nby this reviewer. These additional responsibilities are: \n1.  Develop a comprehensive implementation plan that will guide the process of \nactualizing programs so that meet standards of care \n47 \n\n---\" ---------\n2.  Develop the additional program components recommended by this reviewer \nand oversee their implementation; \n3.  Develop a comprehensive training plan that identifies curricula for all sex \noffender specific training programs as well as a way to monitor its delivery. \nThis would include identifying pre employment training, in service training, \nand a method for testing transfer of information; \n4.  Develop policies and procedures for offense specific staff supervision for all \nof the staffing levels \n5.  Develop and maintain a resource lending library at the central office that can \nbe used by all of the sex offender programs \n6.  Identify culturally appropriate materials to use with specific cultures \n7.  Identify and utilize materials that are written specifically for the \ndevelopmentally delayed \n8.  Develop a comprehensive family involvement program that meets current \nstandards of practice \n9.  Develop plans for a therapeutic milieu, train staff in its implementation, and \nsupervision \n10. Identify and plan a gender specific sex offender program for the female wards \nof the CYA \n11. Identify a hiring and screening method that will elicit those qualities both \nprofessional and personal that are optimal for working with a sexually abusive \npopulation. \n•  Goal Statement:  The Sex Offender Work Group has identified the goals of the \nsex offender treatment programs as the following. \"To provide treatment for all wards \nthat are committed for a sex offense, have a prior adjudication/conviction of a sex \noffense, have a documented history of sex offenses have a reported or documented \npattern of deviant or sexually inappropriate behavior (including some DDMS behaviors \nwith a pattern)\"  (program Overview, May 2003) \nReviewer Comments:  This goal statement rectifies the unfortunate decision to treat only \nthose sex offenders mandated treatment under WIC 727.6.  This decision left \napproximately 600-800 wards in the California Youth Authority who would be released \ninto the community having had no treatment at all.  What's more, the definitions of who \nwas considered to be a treatment priority did not effectively identify all of the highest risk \nsex offenders. \n48 \n\nRecommendation: This is a very good decision and there are no recommendations. \nContinuum of Care model:  The proposed model contains provision for two levels of \ncare - residential and outpatient.  Aftercare, which is an important component of both \nlevels, would take place through the parole system, but would be planned to be consistent \nwith the institutional programs. \nReviewer Comments:  This is a creative idea - that of providing both residential and \noutpatient treatment within the CYA   system- and might be workable under some \nconditions.  The outpatient program design was conceived to be as realistic as possib Ie \nunder the present conditions.  Unfortunately while this idea may be cost effective for the \nYouth Authority, it is improbable that it will facilitate successful sex offender program \ncompletion.  Although the intent to provide different levels of intervention is a good one, \nplacement decisions cannot be made simply by dividing numbers the numbers evenly. \nPlacement decisions cannot be made solely on the basis of the budget when those \ndecisions will not facilitate rehabilitation. \nIt is true that The Youth Authority would be amenable to other levels of care, however. \nThere are many different levels within a continuum of care and several different ways to \ndevelop them.  For example, it is possible to develop all levels of a continuum of care \nwithin one State system, or to link services in a number of State systems.  Correctional \nsystems are not meant to include all levels along the continuum, but could provide some \nof them such as small community based residential centers, group homes, etc, and \noutpatient programs in addition to the standard secure institutional facilities. \nI have grave concerns about providing outpatient programs in all of the institutions. Even \nif outpatient programs were developed, it probably would not be the treatment of choice \nfor a majority of wards.  If this plan were to be carried out, the decision of placement \nshould be made only after a comprehensive assessment to determine if this is appropriate. \nA screening device simply does not provide adequate information to make that decision. \nThere are many logical reasons why this plan is concerning.  The first is the well-known \nfact that child molesters and rapists have a difficult time in the general population. As one \nyouth said to me, \"in the general pop you gotta think about survival, not treatment\". \nAnother youth said, \"Outpatient groups might work in a place like Ventura.  I've been in \nseveral other institutions in the eYA and it wouldn't work in any of those places.\" \nThe second problem is one of logistics - of bringing youth to the group.  Observation \nduring site visits revealed that that there already appeared to be difficulty in getting the \nwards to planned activities on time.  In Ventura, where the boys were brought to sex \noffender group in the main building the comment was made that the group was never \nconsistent - sometimes there was no one to bring them over, sometimes the group got \nthere so late that most of the allotted time was over. \n49 \n\nThe third concern involves the lack of a functioning therapeutic milieu, which is \nconsidered an important component of residential treatment with this particular \npopulation, and which would be totally absent in an outpatient program. \nThe final difficulty has to do with the intensity of the program. The outpatient program is \ndesigned to be 50% less intensive than the residential program yet there is no data that \nindicates that the youth expected to be assigned to the outpatient programs need 50% less \nintensive treatment. \nRecommendation: Take another look at the decision to have the majority of the wards \nplaced in outpatient treatment.  Develop a profile of the wards that would be suitable for \nan outpatient program in a general prison population, and then make sure that only those \nwards which met this standard are admitted to those programs. \nIt is very likely that there is a need for more residential programs and fewer outpatient \nprograms.  As the plan indicates the wards in the outpatient programs would need to be \nhighly motivated, and with good ego strength.  I doubt that you can find approximately \n500 or more highly motivated wards in the CYA  .  Sex offenders don't often come into \ntreatment already highly motivated.  This is typically one of the first challenges of \ntreatment. \nIf the plan for outpatient programs were to be carried out, then a comprehensive, focused \nassessment must be the deciding factor of appropriateness for admission to that program. \nSince there is an adequate amount of space and a large amount of numbers that need \noffense specific treatment, very serious consideration needs to be given to more \nresidential programs. \n•  Placement Decisions:  The SORD, which has been recently updated and \nimproved, is the sole screening device for decision making regarding placement in \nresidential or outpatient programs. \nReviewer Comments: It is the usual practice for a risk assessment (needs assessment, \npre disposition assessment) to be conducted pre-sentencing, so that informed decisions \ncan be made regarding placement.  Risk assessments generally are composed of a humber \nof tests, not just a single screening survey.  Since it isn't the standard practice in \nCalifornia for there to be a pre-sentencing assessment, this results in wards being placed \nin the California Youth Authority that might be more appropriately, safely, and \ninexpensively served in the community in a less restrictive environment. \nRecommendation:  The lack ofa pre-sentencing assessment creates a serious dilemma, \nthough one with several possible solutions.  The CY A could require such assessments \nprior to accepting a ward for admission, or the court could require them prior to \nsentencing.  Other states have opted for the establishment of uniform policies and \nprocedures by appointing a multidisciplinary, multi-agency task force to plan procedures \nfor the identification; prosecution, placement and treatment of sexually abusive juveniles. \n50 \n\nSome states have made these standards, others have produced them as guidelines, and \nstill others label them protocols.  All, however, serve the immediate purpose ofproviding \na uniform structure for all of the agencies involved and concerned. \nAnother solution would be a CYA   sex offender diagnostic center, staffed with \nprofessionals who have the special training necessary to conduct offense specific \nassessments. All assessments could take place in the diagnostic center prior to the ward \nbeing assigned to an institution.  This would not only aid in the appropriate placement of \nthe wards, but would provide the intensive assessments needed for their individualized \ntreatment plan. A diagnostic center could support itself by contracting with private \nagencies to conduct offense specific assessments.  It would not be difficult to develop a \nprotocol for assessments, because there are already protocols available which meet \nstandards of practice .. This is one of the areas where California has the ability to \nbecome a leader in the field \n•  Treatment Approach:  \"Residential treatment will use a core cognitive \nbehavioral approach\" (Program Overview, May 2003) \nReviewer Comments:  The cognitive behavioral approach is used by 79% of the \nprograms for juvenile sex offenders. (Safer Society Foundation Survey, 2001) In a \nposition paper dated Nov. 6, 1996, The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers \nstates:\"The core approach used in many programs is cognitive-behavioral, which utilizes \na relapse prevention model.  The goal of this approach is to enable the offender to \nunderstand their own behavior, take responsibility for and increase motivation to change \nthat behavior as well  learn the skills necessary to control their deviancy. With training in \nrelapse prevention techniques, offenders learn to identify the chain of thoughts and \nbehaviors that, if uninterrupted, could culminate in the commission of a sex offense. As \npart oflearning their individual sexual assault cycle or chain, the offender also learns \nalternative non-harmful techniques to intervene and stop the progression of behaviors.\" \nRecommendation: Even with the cognitive behavioral approach as core, there is always \na need to individualize treatment to meet specific needs.  Other approaches should be \nused as well, where called for by the treatment needs assessment. This is clearly within \nthe expertise of the psychologists currently working in the CY A, and needs to be formal \npart of treatment planning. \n•  Length of program: Although the length of the program has been estimated for \nevery phase and stage, the point is made that the program is competency based and not all \nwill pass through at the same rate. \nReviewer Comments:  The length estimated is typical for secure residential programs. \nHowever, being competency based means that the wards will move through the phases at \ndifferent rates.  This means that the program adapts treatment to meet the characteristics \n51 \n\nof the ward, rather than forcing them into a theoretical time frame which doesn't \neffectively meet their actual treatment needs. \nRecommendation: This is a good plan. In order for there to be no misunderstanding of \nthe program's treatment objectives, the meaning of \"competency based\" needs to be \nformally defined in concrete terms. \n•  Discharge Planning:  The plan calls for discharge to be competency based. \nReviewers Comments: Being competency based means that there are measurable \nconcrete behavioral objectives that determine a ward's readiness for discharge.  These \nwill be clear to both the wards and the staff and hopefully will eliminate two problems \nabout discharge.  The first is the mistaken belief that finishing paperwork or time spent is \nthe completion of a treatment program.  The second is that discharge readiness cannot be \ndetermined by a staff belief or feelings about award's progression or lack of in treatment. \nAlthough clinical input is part of decision making and is important, it should not be all of \nit. \nRecommendation: There are actually three different kinds of discharges possible in a \nsex offender program, and responses to each must be prepared and planned for by staff \nThe CYA   should develop comprehensive policies and procedures for the following kinds \nof discharge: \no  Successful program completion: This requires accomplishment of specific and \nmeasurable, objective, observable changes in behavioral, emotional, attitudinal, \nsocial, cognitive and psychological functioning, as well as the demonstrated \nability to apply these changes to real life situations.  The treatment plan is one of \nthe vehicles that document these changes. \no  Unplanned unsuccessful discharge: This happens when the ward leaves or is \nremoved from treatment suddenly, so that no planning for discharge is possible, \nand before all or any treatment goals are met.  In these situations (if the ward is \nstill in the facility) regular follow-up with the individual will determine if and \nwhen they are ready to engage in treatment again. \no  Planned administrative discharge:  This kind of discharge from the treatment \nprogram is necessary when a ward's behavior becomes a serious threat to either \nthemselves or others and regular behavioral management interventions have been \nunsuccessful, or when the ward has been unresponsive to treatment over a \nsignificant period of time.  Again, in this situation regular follow-ups with the \nward will determine if and when they are ready to re-engage in treatment. \n52 \n\n----------\nRESDIENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM: \nThe plan calls for four residential programs, which would serve a total of about 200 \nwards.  These are Humboldt at OH Close, Feather at NA Chadejerian;Carter at FC \nNelles, and J Company at HG Stark.  Humboldt and Carter have been in operation for \nsome time, and Feather and J Company opened the summer of 2003.  The following are \nthe stated program goals: \n•  Program components \no  Sex offender group - 6 or 7 wards - 3 hours weekly \no  Large group - 2 groups per week - 4 hours weekly \no  Resources group - 2 groups per week - 3 hours weekly \no  Individual treatment work - 4 hours weekly \no  Sex Offender Treatment Homework - 6 hours \no  Sex offender specific program - 20 hours \n•  Proposed Staffing for 50 - 60 wards \no  One fulltime program administrator \no  One supervising casework specialist \no  One senior youth correctional counselor \no  One case work specialist \no  8-9 youth correction counselors on 50 bed programs with closed dorms \no  10 youth correctional counselors on a 60 bed program with open donus \no  One office technician \no  3 psychologists, one specializing in developmentally delayed wards, and \none in psychopathic wards_ \no  9 youth correctional counselors, 3 assigned to each psychologist \nReviewer Comments:  This is an excellent plan and well conceived. With the addition of \nsome details it will meet standards of practice. \n•  Resources Groups (2 groups per week) that includes Core: 1) Victim's \nAwareness, 2) Criminal Thinking Errors, Addictive Behavior, 4) Human \nSexuality, (5) Human Interaction/Social Skills as well as additional resource \ngroups as prescribed by treatment team 6) Recovery, 7) Stress Management and \n8) Anger management - 3 hours. \nReviewer Comments:  The suggestions for the resource groups are excellent. The \ncurricula for the groups were designed with the CY A population in mind and so \nthe exercises and homework are applicable to that particular population. It has \nalso been developed so that it can be modified to meet individual needs - such as \nthose of the developmentally delayed. These particular resource groups are \n. important because they all cover areas that are known to be problem areas for \n53 \n\nsexually abusive youth. The resource groups are designed to teach skills that will \novercome those problems. \nFor example: \no  Human Sexuality: One study of 1600 juveniles found that only about one third \nof the subjects perceived sex as a way to demonstrate love or caring for \nanother person.  The others perceived sex as a way to feel power and control \nto dissipate anger, or to hurt, degrade or punish (Ryan et a1 1996).  In addition, \nthe majority of sexual abusers admitted the use of hard-core porn, which \nobjectifies the sex partner (Ford and Linney, (1997); Becker and Stein \n(1994».  : \no  Social skills:  Research repeatedly documents that juveniles with sexual \nbehavior problems have significant deficits in social competence, (Becker \n(1990); Knight and Prentky, (1993». Numerous other studies point out the \nfact that sexually abusive juveniles have inadequate social skills, poor peer \nrelationships, and experience a great deal of social isolation ( Kat, (1990); \nMiner and Crimmins (1995».  For these reasons it is routine for programs to \naddress interpersonal skills in a variety of different ways, and to avoid the use \nof social isolation as punishment for behavior problems.  This is another \nreason why the therapeutic milieu is so important, through providing wards \nopportunities to really use these skills, not just participate in academic \nlearning. \no  Criminal Thinking Errors or Cognitive Distortions: Literature as well as \nresearch suggests that cognitive distortions, such as blaming victims, are \nassociated with sexual reoffending in juveniles (Kahn and Chambers (1991». \no  Victim Awareness:  It is commonly believed, though not proven by research, \nthat developing an awareness of the suffering of victims and being able to be \nempathic will be a deterrent to future offending. \no  Recovery:  The following are commonly found in the backgrounds of \njuveniles with sexually abusive behavior problems: being sexually abused; \nbeing physically abused; witnessing family violence; being neglected (Kahn \nand Chambers (1991); Kobashi, et al (1995); Ryan et aI, (1996».  Many of the \nabove factors also exist in the backgrounds of all delinquents, and the role of \nthese experiences as they relate to the development of sexual offending is \nquite complex (Prentky, et al (2000». \no  Addictive Behavior: This is behavior which has compulsive and physiological \ncomponent and is believed by some to be part of sexual offending or to \nsupport sexual offending behavior.  It is the model for substance abuse \ntreatment. \n54 \n\no  Stress Management: Cortoni and Marshall (2001) studied sexual activity \nfunctions as a coping strategy for sexual offenders among 89 incarcerated \noffenders. Sexual offenders reported using sexual activities, both consenting \nand non-consenting as a coping strategy for stressful and problematic \nsituations at a higher rate than non-sexual offenders.  When compared to non \nsex offenders, sex offenders evidenced a sexual preoccupation during \nadolescence, which was related to the use of sex as a coping strategy. \no  Anger Management:  There is research that indicates that sexual behavior may \nbe the extemalization of emotions that cannot be resolved and that anger and \nhurt may be at the root of those emotions.  Therefore, teaching how to manage \nanger is an important part of the treatment program.  : \nRecommendations: The following are suggestions that will enhance the program but \nare not critical to meeting basic standards of care. \no  Consider a few other resource groups as well, such as problem solving, \nconflict resolution, parenting, job skills, and dating/ healthy sexuality skills \nfor example or make sure that these subjects are part of the learning \nexperience somewhere in the program. \no  Professionals who specialize in working with special populations such as the \ndevelopmentally delayed, those with attention deficit disorder, psychopaths \nand female sex offenders have developed materials to use with these \npopulations. Although we have been modifying materials for populations for \nyears it makes sense to use the materials previously developed by the \nprofessionals who know them best. \no  The Human Sexuality Curriculum is good, but it needs to be expanded and \nlengthened to include much more on the development of sexual values.  The \nissue of unhealthy sexuality is at the core of these youth's problems.  They \nknow a lot about sex but nothing about healthy sexuality.  They know a lot \nabout the use of sex to get all sorts of needs met, but nothing about sex as part \nof a loving relationship.  They have no dating skills, and are totally ignorant \nabout the establishment of positive male-female relationships. \nInterviews with both wards and staff indicate that sexual attitudes are a \nproblem not only in the sex offender population, but in the general population \nas wel1.  Quote from wards: \"there's a lot of sexual behavior going on that \nstaff don't see\".  Quotes from staff, \"Boundary issues are sometimes a \nproblem, and there have been allegations of staff being inappropriate,\" and, \n\"There is a real problem with the sexual harassment of staff.\" \nIn some cases sexual harassment refers to the fact that a ward masturbates so a female \nstaff will see him, looks or leers at female staff in ways that are clearly sexual in \nnature, use sexual language, and watch female staff so intently that some perceive it \n55 \n\nas a variation of stalking.  None of these behaviors are unusual for sex offenders, and \nare to be expected. It is even important that the behaviors are seen so that staffwill \nhave an opportunity to confront and teach the wards involved.  These behaviors are \ncommon and basic treatment issues for this population, and they need to be dealt with \nin ways, which are therapeutic rather than punitive.  Punishment as such does not \nwork, and some wards even find it enjoyable in direct proportion to punishment's \nseverity and discomfort.  Getting staff to punish them is one of the ways some wards \nmanipulate unqualified and! or inadequately trained staff. \nSexual Offender Residential Treatment Program Rules and rarticipation \n•  Agreement: The plan is for the ward to sign a statement that states the following: \n\"I have participated in identifying the treatment objectives indicted on my individual \nneeds assessment for the purpose of assisting me though the rehabilitative process.\" A \nsimilar statement identifies the staff s commitment to the wards and to the rehabilitative \nprocess. \nReviewer Comments: This treatment contract has been well written and serves \nthe purpose ofunderIining the seriousness of the treatment contract both for the ward \nand for the staff  Everyone has responsibilities here that are important. \nRecommendation: This is a good plan and there are no recommendations. \n•  Definitions under Residential Program Curriculum: \nFantasy log/tracking in the definitions. section was left blank and needs more explanation. \nUnder Incest, sibling incest was excluded and needs to be noted. \nSexual abuser and sexual assault, the definition here is inadequate. \nSexual deviancy: this needs further definition. \nSex offender:  This needs further definition. \nReviewers Comments: It is an excellent idea to define tenninology for those who will \nread this document and are not familiar with this field. \nRecommendation:  The Center for Sex Offender Management has a glossary of sex \noffender terminology that could be helpful in definitions as does The National Task Force \nReport (1993) \n56 \n\n•  Phases and Stages:  \"The residential program is divided into 12 stages. 1-10 is \nprovided in the residential program, stage 11 is provided on Maintenance in the general \npopulation, and stage 12 is provided on parole.  The 10 residential stages are grouped into \nthree phases, Orientation Core Program, and Relapse Prevention.\"(program Overview, \nMay 2003) \nReviewers Comments: Good plan that with a few additions will meet national standards \nof practice.  Those additions will be noted under recommendations. \n•  Orientation/Assessment Phase \nAssessment: The plan calls for assessments to be completed by stage three of Phase One, \nand refers to these as pre-treatment tests and assessments which are to be done again at \nthe end of stage nine for post placement data. \nReviewer Comments: Keeping in mind that there is more than one assessment process \nnecessary at more than one treatment stage this would be thought of as the needs \nbased/treatment planning and the discharge evaluation assessment.  Considering that the \npre sentencing· assessment had taken place as normal in most cases, then the assessment \nstages that should take place in the CYA   by the end of stage three would be the needs \nbased/treatment planning and at the end of stage nine - the treatment evaluation/pre \ndischarge.  The monitoring/follow-up assessments would be the responsibility of \naftercare. \n•  Core Program Phase \nRecommendation:  The plans for this phase are good and there are no recommendations. \n•  Relapse Prevention/stabilization phase: \nReviewers Comments: This is one of the most important components of any sex \noffender treatment program. Relapse prevention helps an offender recognize situations \nthat create a potential for relapse and identify ways of controlling deviant behavior or \navoiding high risk situations. \nRecommendation: Develop a policy and procedure for sharing this plan with all \nmembers of the support group. \n•  Transition \nRecommendation: This is a good plan and there are no recommendations. \n57 \n\n•  Therapeutic Relationship:  This identifies the importance of the therapist \nforming a therapeutic relationship with the ward in order for changes to take \nplace. \nReviewers Comments:  The importance of this has been covered in Question One along \nwith recommendations made. \nAdditional program components needed as part ;of this plan: \n•  The Assessment and Control of Deviant Sexual Arousal: There is no planned \npolicy or procedure to address this problem.  In the past it has been left up to \nindividual psychologists. \nReviewers Comments: Two different studies illustrate the need to pay special attention to the \nissue of deviant sexual arousal: The first: \"Deviant sexual arousal is strongly associated \nwith sexually coercive behavior (Barbaree and Marshall (l994)~ Earls and Quinsy (l994)~ \nPrentky and Knight (1993». Sexual recidivism is associated with deviant sexual arousal \n(Schram, Milloy and Rowe (1991». \nThe Center for Sex Offender Management in Washington published a paper in 1999 \nentitled \"Understanding Juvenile Sexual Offending Behavior: Emerging Research, \nTreatment Approaches and Management\" This is what it says about deviant sexual \narousal and young people:  \"A minority of sexually abusive youth manifest established \ndeviant sexual arousal and interest patterns. These arousal and interest patterns are \nrecurrent and intense, and relate directly to the nature of the sexual behavior problem \n(e.g., sexual arousal to young children). Deviant sexual arousal is more clearly \nestablished as a motivator of adult sexual offending, particularly as it relates to \npedophilia. In general, the sexual arousal patterns of sexually abusive youth appear more \nchangeable than those of adult sex offenders, and relate less directly to their patterns of \noffending behavior\" (Hunter and Becker, 1994, Hunter et al, 1994) \nRecommendation: It is important that CYA have a policy and procedure for the \nassessment and treatment of deviant sexual arousal.  At this time it is being left up to the \nindividual psychologists to address, which means there is no uniform method suggested \nor recommended for this important treatment intervention. \nAssessment of sexual arousal can be made several different ways - through self-report or \nthrough the use of a device called the penile plethysmograph.  The Abel Screen which \nscreens for sexual interest is proposed by the CYA  .  Not all sex offenders have a problem \nwith deviant sexual arousal but since it is an indicator o\\f high risk it is important that it \nbe assessed and treated when it does occur. There are a variety of accepted ways to \naddress the reduction of deviant sexual arousal such as covert sensitization, assisted \ncovert sensitization, olfactory conditioning and satiation therapy, and aversive behavioral \n58 \n\nrehearsaL  These are generally coupled with techniques for increasing appropriate seKUal \narousal. \nThe Abel Assessment for Interest in paraphilias which is suggested by the Sex Offender \nWork Group is a computer driven assessment approach that provides an evaluation of a \njuveniles sexual interest patterns based on his or her reaction times when viewing slides \nof potential sexually evocative stimuli. (Abel Screening, 1996 The Abel screen is \nrelatively new but many programs are using this methodology. \nSince deviant arousal is correlated with reoffending it is very important that a \ndetermination is made about whether or. not it is a part of the offender's behavior patterns \nand for that reason the industry endorse.s the use of physiological measures as a way to \ndetermine whether or not this is present and to what extent.  Self report is useful but not \nalways fully truthful. \n•  Family Counseling Component:  \"In Stages three, six and nine, if willing and \nable the plan recommends a minimum of three family counseling sessions as well as \nthe provision of a family handbook which includes information on how they can \nassist wards in their treatment and how to prepare for their treatment needs on parole. \nIn stage three wards wili disclose sexual offenses, disclose sexual assault cycle during \nstage six and review their relapse prevention plan during stage nine.  The \npsychologist and yee will facilitate the family counseling sessions\" (Program \nOverview, May, 2003) \n. Reviewer Comments:  While this is a good beginning it in no way meets standards of \npractice, which recommends family involvement in all programming for juvenile sex \noffenders. The national survey on sex offender programs showed that the average sex \noffender program had .81 family sessions per week.  Three sessions in eighteen months \nwill not suffice for residents who will be residing at home again, or who need major work \nwith family to deal with family issues.  However, the plan is a big improvement on the \ncurrent one which has no planned family involvement. \nRecommendation: The eYA needs to identify someone who is responsible for family \nassessment, treatment planning, reunification, and visitation and progress reports.  My \n. expectation is that this will require one more psychologist per residential program and \none more per outpatient program. \n•  Program Failures:  When wards are failing the program, the treatment team will \nhold a case conference to decide the proper course of action. \nReviewers Comments:  This is an excellent policy for sex offender programs and \nfacilitates planning for program failures.  It is not always necessary to transfer wards and \nthis is a proactive move to make decision making more informed. \nRecommendation: The definition of failure must be very clear and the process for \nevaluating whether or not a ward is a program failure identified in policy and procedure. \n59 \n\n•  Maintenance Phase:  The maintenance phase is in the outpatient program and is \nactually stage 11.  It begins after the formal program has been completed in the \nresidential program. It is the same for the outpatient program. \nReviewer Comments:  A community reintegration policy and procedure is the norm for \nmost residential programs.  The reason for this is that it is much easier for youth to \nbehave in prosaically ways in a restricted environment and the goal is to see if they can \npractice those behaviors in a real community environment. These experiences can range \nfrom mainstreaming back into the public schools, outings with family members; to \nvolunteer and paid job eXperience.  Since this would be a huge logistic and resource \nproblem for CYA  , the plan to move the youth back into the general population for a \nmaintenance phase is a good one.  This will give the wards the opportunity to experience \na new environment, one that will be new and probably uncomfortable, in order to see if \nnon offending skills and behaviors have been internalized and will be transferred to \nanother situation. \nRecommendation:  None \n•  Parole:  Parole is planned as the aftercare part of the program. \nReviewers Comments: \"It is important that adequate resources be available to promote a \nsuccessful transition.  In order to be effective, aftercare should be as integral a part of the \nrehabilitative process as the initial assessment and treatment.  It is the part of treatment \nthat most directly connects with the juvenile's future\" \n(National Adolescent Perpetrator Task Force Report, 1993) \nResearch indicates that the post-discharge environment is a powerful factor in \ndetermining the successful long-term adjustment of individuals who have completed \nresidential programs. This is a necessary part of any sex offender program and without \nplans for it the program is incomplete. \nRecommendations:  The piece ofthis 'plan that is missing is the development of what is \nsometimes called a relapse prevention support group, a support group, and a circle of \nsupport or a containment team.  These are the people in one's life that will monitor and \nprovide support for the ward in the community.  There are protocols for support groups \nthat can serve as the model for CYA   to develop the policy. \nOUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM: \n\"Each institution (about 400 - 500 wards) will have an outpatient program and this \nincludes the Intensive Treatment Programs, the Specialized Counseling Programs and the \n60 \n\nSpecialized Behavior Treatment Programs (about75 wards) The offenders slotted to be \ntreated in the residential programs for whom there is not a space will remain in the \ngeneral population and begin treatment in outpatient groups until there is an opening in \nthe appropriate residential treatment program.\"  For this reason the outpatient and \nresidential programs are very similar. \nReviewers Comments:  Comments about the outpatient program model have been made \nin other sections of this document so need not be made again. \nRecommendation: Instead of placing the wards with special problems in the Intensive \nTreatment Program, the Specialized Counseling Programs and the Specialized Behavior \nTreatment Programs, it would be much more effective and appropriate to develop Dual \nDiagnosis programs for sexually abusive wards. \n•  Treatment Program for the Outpatient Group: The plan is for 10 hours of sex \noffender specific treatment a week.  This consists of: one sex offender group -\n2hrs. Per week, 1 core resource group - 1.5 hrs per week; individual work of .5 \nhrs per week and homework -6 hours. \nAgain there are four phases and ten stages with 11 being maintenance and 12 \ntransitions, which is parole.  The phases are the same - the orientation phase, the \ncore program phase, the relapse prevention phase and the transition phase.  The \nprogram has been made similar to the residential program to make movement \nbetween the two easier. \nReviewer Comments:  If there is a population within the California Youth Authority that \nis appropriate for an outpatient program, and if this could be worked out logistically, then \nthis might be workable plan. This model would have a good chance of working in the \nintensive treatment program, the specialized treatment program and the behavior \nmanagement treatment program if these programs would develop a therapeutic milieu. A \ntherapeutic milieu is very appropriate for any mental health program.  In the general \npopulation outpatient programs I have serious doubts if this could be manageable, \nespecially for the large numbers indicated. \nRecommendation:  Prior to putting any outpatient plan in place, conduct a needs \nassessment of the sex offenders currently in the general population to see if this kind of \ntreatment could be workable.  For example, one of the criteria mentioned is trui.t the \noutpatient population would be motivated for treatment.  How many of the current \npopulation is motivated for treatment?  In addition work with the current staff of \ninstitutions to see what tithe problems will be logistically to managing this program and \nhow these problems would have to be worked out. Two concerns which will make this \ndifficult to accomplish:  there is not enough staff allocated to these programs and the \nabsence of a therapeutic milieu will cause numerous behavioral as well as treatment \nproblems. \n61 \n\n•  Staffing for the Outpatient program: The plan is for there to be one \npsychologist per institution who along with one designated staff from the program \nto coordinate the program for the general populatio~ co lead the groups, and \ncoordinate movement to the groups and provide security during the groups.  There \nwill be a parole agent assigned to write progress reports and to lead resource \ngroups. \nThe five core groups are victim awareness, criminal thinking errors, addictive \nbehavior, human sexuality and human interaction social skills.\" \n. Recommendation: Develop a time and task system to see if what is required of these \nstaff members is even possible.  Without doing an extensive assessment it is difficult to \nsee if this will be enough staff \n•  Maintenance Stage: Maintenance stage for outpatient occurs in the general \npopulation as it does for the residential program.  The goal is to continue to \nreinforce the concepts, therapeutic issues and relapse prevention techniques \ncovered during the first 10  states.  The maintenance group will come from both \nthe outpatient and residential programs. \nReviewers Comments:  The concept ofa maintenance stage is a good idea in view of the \nfact that normal community reintegration activates cannot take place. \nRecommendation:  The maintenance stage needs to include some experiences that one \nwould expect in the world outside the institution.  These can be facilitated with role \nplays, drama therapy and the facilitation of some normalization of experiences. \n•  Parole Stage 12: Parole preparation is part of the maintenance stage. The planned \nparole program is the component of the program considered after care.  This \nprogram may include weekly group counseling and the individual counseling \ncurriculum will be similar to those in curricula groups. \nReviewers Comments: Good plan and usually the standard for most programs. \nRecommendation:  Work with parole as closely as possible at facilitating this and \nplanning staff collaboration at all stages. \n62 \n\nWards with Special Needs: \n1.  Developmentally DisabledlLow Cognitive Functioning sex offenders \nAt least one group will be designated for developmentally delayed at each institution in \nthe outpatient programs.  Each residential program will have one psychologist and \napproximately 3 youth correctional counselors specially trained to treat lower functioning \nwards.  Additional hours of annual training are planned for this staff. \nThe coordinator monitors the numbers to make sure they are even in the programs and \nwill oversee additional training. \nRecommendations: Plan for additional training of the outpatient staff as well as the \nresidential staff  There are many good resource materials being developed particularly \nfor this population and so instead of modifying for the developmentally delayed I would \nstart with new materials designed with them in mind. \n2.  Psychopathic Sex Offenders: \nThe plan is for the psychologist to administer the Hare Psychopath Check list to any \nwards on their caseloads that they consider psychopathic.  Psychopathic wards will be \nplaced on one caseload and psychologist that covers this caseload will receive an \nadditional 16 hours of training: \nReviewer Comments:  This plan is what experts in working usually recommend for this \npopulation with psychopaths. \nRecommendations:  None \n3.  Cases on Appeal: The program coordinator will track and monitor the appeal if \nrelated to sexually offending so that can be placed in-group at appropriate time \nwill \nReviewer Comments:  This is a good plan and  prevent wards from falling between \nthe cracks as they do at this time. \nRecommendations:  None \n4.  Wards in Special Management Programs/Recalcitrant Wards: Providing on \nan individual basis - doesn't have how often they will meet with them. \nReviewers Comments: The special management programs as designed for the CYA   are \ndesigned for punishment not correction.  Without a teaching correction model wards just \nlearn to outlast the punishment so that they can do what they did again. \n63 \n\nRecommendations: The sex offender programs need their own design for special \nmanagement procedures for wards. The response of sexual offenders is often \ncounterproductive to the typical measures used.  For example: Sex offenders generally \nlike to be isolated so isolation is not a good management program for them.  The more \nisolation the more time for deviant fantasies and get back schemes for them. \nAny plan needs to include the number of contacts required, the amount of time required, \nwho is responsible and who monitors for quality control. \n•  Case Conference: This is planned for every sixty days with all members of the \ntreatment team. \nRecommendation: Good plan, no recommendations. \n•  Large Group: This is planned to handle living issues in the community.  For sex \noffenders this is often a case of the program being actualized in the living \nenvironment. \nRecommendation:  Good plan, no recommendations. \n•  Staff Training: The comment at the beginning of this section mentions that \nthe high degree of turnover as result of post and bid (staffing in relationship to \nseniority bidding makes more training critical. \nReviewers Comments: Basically, this is an excellent plan and is comparable with \ndozens of other training plans that have been reviewed.  The numbers of hours in sex \noffender training are comparable with what is considered good practice.  This \nplan needs to be expanded to include a policy and procedure for developing and \nimplementing training curricula. \nStaff needs a mandate for certain hours of training prior to being in direct contact with \nsexually abusive youth - the psychologists need more intensive training than the rest of. \nthe staff.  The rest of the staff needs to have a great deal of practical training in how to \nwith these particular wards.  Also training should be competency based and a plan \ndeveloped to indicate how competencies will be measured. \nThis plan also needs to indicate how training competencies will be measured. \nRecommendation:  Recommendations are made in Question One. \n•  Polygraph:  The plan calls for the use of the polygraph.  The purpose of a \n64 \n\npolygraph examination is to verify a perpetrators completeness regarding offense \nhistory and compliance with therapeutic directives and terms of supervision (Emerick \nand Dutton, (1993)).  There is more research data on the use of the polygraphy with \nadult sexual offenders than there is with juveniles and it is not recommended for lise \nfor youth under 14. \nIn Texas, law requires use of the polygraph on certain sexually abusive youth. In \n1997 legislation was enacted that prescribed release conditions including counseling \nand treatment for adolescents convicted of certain sex offenses.  Under this law, \nyouth can be required as a condition of release from the \"Texas Youth 'Commissi()n \nto attend psychological counseling sessions and to submit to polygraph examinations \nin order to evaluate treatment progress (Texas Human Resources Code, Title 3, Ch \n21, Sub.A, Sec. 6l.0813). \nReviewers Comments:  The following data makes a strong case for the use of the \npolygraph: \n•  Research on use of polygraph with juveniles: (Emerick and Dutton, (1993, \n1997») \nVictims at intake - 1.87, after polygraph - 2.85 \nOffenses at intake - 20.65, after polygraph - 76.59 \nPornography use at intake - 27%, after polygraph - 78% \nVoyeurism at intake - 29, and after polygraph - 49 \nRape at intake - 15, and after polygraph - 29 \nFetish at intake - 12, and after polygraph - 24 \nRecommendation:  The CYA should utilize the use of the polygraph, along with the \nstandards for its use developed by the Center for Sex Offender Management. \n•  Megans Law:  The plan gives a very comprehensive overview of Megans' \nLaw and the registration of sex offenders. \nRecommendation: Very well done, no recommendations. \n•  Research Component: Recommended for every sex offense specific \nprogramming - with out this component there is no way to track if programs \nare being effective, if wards are recidivating, if the programs are delivering \nthe treatment components: \nRecommendation: Excellent plan and no recommendations. \n65 \n\n•  Performance Standards: These performance standards meet best practice \nguidelines.  They must be adopted as policy along with a design for using \nthem to evaluate programs. \nThere are several issues not covered as part of the plan that should be as part of any \ncomprehensive plan.  They include the following: \n•  Suitable Staff: This issue was covered in question one and is an important \npart of any program proposal.  As a paper written for the National Institute of \nCorrections (1988) states, \"The most effective therapists, either professional \nor paraprofessional, have personalities suitable to working with this group'\" \n•  Program Integration:  This issue was also covered in question one along \nwith the reasons for the importance of program integration. \nSummary:  This program evaluation has been as comprehensive as the allotment of \ntime and resources made possible.  The California Youth Authority has been very \ngracious in allowing me the opportunity to conduct this evaluation.  Although the final \nconclusion may look very negative, these are not my feelings about the Youth Authority, \nits staff or its potential for improvement. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJerry Thomas \nIthomas Consulting and Training Services \n66 \n\nAddendum A \nPERSONAL AND GROUP INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED AS PART OF \nTHE EVALUATION OF THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY SEX \nOFFENDER PROGRAMS: \nThe following does not include every name of every person spoken to as some of the \nconversations were quite informal, not scheduled, or only in passing. \nOrientation Meeting: \n•  Expert Witnesses \n•  California Youth Authority Representatives \n•  Prison Law Office Representatives \nCalifornia Youth Authority Central Office, Sacramento: \n•  Jerry Harper, Director, Department of the Youth Authority \n•  Kip Lowe, Assistant Deputy Director \n•  Jack Wallace, Youth Authority Administrator, Mental Health \n•  Deborah Johnson,  Sex Offender Task Force Coordinator, Sex Offender Program \nManager \n•  William Berndt, Office of Population Management, Parole Agent ill \n•  Steve Stenoski, Youth Authority Administrator, Program Compliance Unit \n•  Jill Weston, Office of Victim Service, Parole Agent IT \n•  Teresa Isorena, Office of Research, Research Analyst \n•  Carrie Ross Price, Office of Ombudsman \n•  Sherrie Ellis, Office of the Ombudsman \n•  J.

These \norganizations  include  The  Center  for  Disease  Control,  The  American  Medical \nAssociation  and  The  World  Health  Assembly.  The  American Medical  Association \n(AMA) labels sexual assault as a \"silent violent epidemic in the United States today.\" \nThe statistics of the mental  health,  social services and correctional populations alone. \nreveal  that considerable  percentages of those populations were the victims of sexual \nassault as children. The time and resources of numerous government and private agencies \nare spent in the prevention of sexual abuse, as well as in addressing the aftermath.  There \nis no doubt that the failure to prevent sexual abuse will ultimately affect all of us in some \nway, personally, emotionally or financially \nThe serious harm caused by sex offenders underscores the significant need to develop \nmethods of reducing the risks these offenders pose to society.  Appropriate treatment of \nsexually abusive populations is only one of the ways to stop sexual abuse,  but it is a \nvitally important one.  Although the eradication of sexual abuse is unlikely, intervening \nappropriately and aggressively at every level can significantly decrease it. \nTreatment Efficacy and Sex Offender Recidivism: \nSome people may believe that certain acts or types of delinquent juveniles mitigate the \nState's responsibilities to these wards.  In the case ofj uvenile sexual offenders this is \ngenerally because of the survival of several myths about sexually abusive youth.  In \nparticular, the beliefs that these juveniles are untreatable and have an uncontrollable \ncompulsion to reoffend. \nThere has been an increase of general recidivism in the CYA  .  Many believe that this is \ndue to the changes made by the CY A within the last decade from a rehabilitation model \nto a correctional model.  At present, the total recidivism of all CYA   parolee's ranges \nfrom 62-91%, depending largely upon the length of time after parole used in the \nmeasurement and the goals of the source.  In only a single study by State correctional \nauthorities, the \"National Comparisons from State Recidivism Studies\", by the Florida \nDepartment of Juvenile Justice (1999) did California not lead the nation in recidivism \n(Maryland 77%, CA 76%, NY 69%, and FL 63%). \nYet despite the conditions, which created this rise in juvenile recidivism in California, the \nrecidivism of juvenile sex offender parolees in the Carter Program has remained much \n16 \n\n__ \n---_._ _  _. \n.........  .. \nlower compared to almost all other categories of parolee.  A study of recidivism of the \nCarter Sexual Offender Program at the Fred C. Nelles facility indicated that only 23.5% \nof the study subjects committed a revocable offense of any type within 12 months, much \nlower than the recidivism rates of other populations. The August 2000 Implementation \nand Process Report by the California Continuum of Care Sex Offender Program \n(CCSOP) produced similar results.  Numerous studies in the U. S. and Canada verify \nthese trends iIi juvenile sex offender recidivism who have completed treatment. \nRecidivism being defined as rearrest. Some studies even report figures as low as 3-7% \nrecidivism of all appropriately treated juvenile sexual offenders commit another sexual \noffense within 6 years (Becker, J.V. (1990); Borduin, C.M., Henggeler, S.W., Blaske,. \nD.M., & Stein, RI. (1990); Hall, G. C. (1995); Alexander, M.A. (1999); etc.). \nThe myths about the untreatability of these youth owe their origins to early efforts to \napply generic, traditional mental health counseling methods to this population.  These \nmethods, which attempt to fit the client to the treatment rather than the treatment to the \nclient, simply do not work, and would be a waste of taxpayer money if applied within the \nCalifornia Youth Authority (L. Furby, M.R Weinrott and L. Blackshaw (1989); Borduin, \nC.M., Henggeler, S.W., Blaske, D.M., & Stein, RJ. (1990); etc.) \nWhen the appropriate, specialized methods are used with this population, however, \ntreatment can have a tremendous impact on the prevention of future offending behavior. \nIn its 1998 \"Review of Agency Program Effectiveness\", a five year evaluation, the Texas \nYouth Commission reported that rearrest rates for any offense were reduced by 86% \npercent for those completing at least 12 months of specialized treatment.  In 1991 Barry \nMaletzky, MD and Kevin McGovern, Ph.D. of the Sexual Abuse Clinic of Portland, \nOregon conducted a follow up study of roughly 5000 adult male offenders treated \nbetween 1973 and 1990 using specialized, behavior- oriented methods.  Their criteria for \n\"treatment success\" included: no re-arrest; self-report of no maladaptive sexual \nbehaviors; plethysmograph-verified reduced deviant arousal maintained post-treatment; \nand, specialists' evaluations of client responses and behavior.  Applying these stringent \nmeasures to the subject offenders, some of who had concluded treatment as long as 17 \nyears previously, success was achieved with 94.7% of pedophiles who targeted opposite \nsex juveniles, and 86.4% of those who targeted same-sex children.  Rapists showed \n73.5% success, exhibitionists and public masturbators about 92%, and subjects referred \nfor various other paraphilias demonstrated success ranging from 80% (frotteurs) to 1000/0 \n(zoophiliacs).  . \n17 \n\n-------------\nAddendum E: \nInformation about Sexually Abusive Juveniles: \nWho are sexually abusive juveniles?  Sexually abusive youth come from all \nsocioeconomic backgrounds, all ethnic groups, ail types of families, and from every kind \nof community. They are a heterogeneous mix of different types and characteristics \n(Bourke and Donohue (1996); Knight and Prentky (1999». They differ. according to \nvictim and offense characteristics, types of offending behavior, histories of child \nmaltreatment, sexual knowledge and experiences, academic and cognitive functioning, \nand mental health problems (Knight and Prentky (1993); Weinrott (1996». They range \non a continuum from the naive experimenter to the disturbed impulsive, from the \ndevelopmentally delayed to the gifted, and from the charming sociopath to the criminally \nsadistic. This means that their treatment needs which can be very different and each will \nneed the benefit of individualized planning. \nThe terminology used for sexual offenders varies greatly and from state to state.  Some of \nthe definitions are legal in origin and some are clinical.  A universally accepted but \nsimple definition is an individual who behaves sexually with another person without that \nperson's consent.  For treatment providers this is the most important definition.  One can \nbe sexually abusive without it falling under any legal qualification.  The act is harmful \nwhatever the legal definition may be. \nWe do know a great deal about juvenile offenders at his point that is very helpful. \nHaving this information we can develop programs to target the specific problems and \nimpact on those issues which have shown to be high risk factors for sexual offending and \nfor reoffending. \no  86% of adolescent sex offenders committed a non-sexual offense as well as a \nsexual offense (Jacobs et al (1998». \no  40% to 800/0 of juvenile sex offenders have been found to be sexually abused, and \n20 to 50% have been physically abused. (Hunter and Becker, (1998), Kahn and \nChambers, (1991)-\no  Exposure to family violence is linked to the likelihood of sexually offending as an \nadolescent, as well as the severity of psychosexual disturbance (Fagen and \nWexler, (1998». \no  Exposure to aggressive male role models, exposure to severe community violence \nmay also increase the likelihood of engaging in violent and antisocial behavior \n(Johnson-Reid, (1998». \n18 \n\no  Sexually abusive juveniles have high rates of learning disabilities, the presence of \nbehavioral problems, difficulties with impulse control and judgment. (Karvosi et \nai, (1991), Epps, (1991». \no  Four developmental antecedents of sexual aggression were found in a study of 81 \nsexual offenders: caretaker inconsistency, institutionalization, family instability \nand physical and sexual abuse and neglect (prentky and Knight, (1998». \no  Domestic violence was reported in 47% of the families of sexually abusive youth, \nRichardson, et aI (1997». \no  In a retrospective study of 51 families of sexually abusive youth, 25% lacked \nsexual boundaries, 33% reported the presence ofpomographic materials. \n(Manucha and Mezey, (1998». \no  Barbaree et aI, (1998) concluded that sexual offending is a result of childhood \nabuse, inadequate attachment, dysfunctional family and temperamental variables. \no  Most common DSMIII diagnoses in sample of male juvenile sex offenders were \nconduct disorder (48%) and for juveniles who raped (75%)  (Kavousrsi, Kaplan \nand Becker, (1997» \no  Sexually abusive youth in residential programs had higher rates of hyperactivity \nor restlessness, depression and anxiety, fire setting, encopresis, early onset of \nneurological illnesses or conditions;learning disorders, and health problems than \nthe non sex offending population. (Bagley and Schewchuck-Dann,(l991). \no  Substance abuse is identified as a problem for many juveniles who have sexually \noffended but the role of substance abuse is very unclear. (Miner et aI, (1997». \no  The majority of sexually abusive youth are male, but there are significant \nnumbers of sexually abusive females. A survey of 2,600 men and women revealed \nthat women abused 18% ofthe abused subjects (Finklehor, (1990». \no  In a study of rapists abused in childhood (Burgess, et ai, (1987»,40 % were \nfound to have been abused by females. In a Maine study (Righthand, Hennings, \nand Wigley, 1989); females represeilted 11 percent (40) of the 348 juveniles \nidentified as sex offenders by the Maine Departments of Human Services and \nCorrections during a 12-month period between 1988 and 1989 \no  There are meaningful similarities and differences between female and male sexual \noffenders. The girls' offending behaviors were similar to the boys both in terms of \ntypes of offenses committed, and the tendency  to victimize young children of the \nopposite gender.  Girls, however, typically had more severe victimization \nexperiences themselves and more severe mental health problems. Matthews, et aI, \n(1997». \n19 ",
