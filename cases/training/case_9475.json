They involve nonetheless a common problem 00 the\n97\nintegration of the public schools in the major metropolitan centers of this Commonwealth; they have a common\npoint of origin 00 the August 17, 1972 decision of the Commonwealth Court in the case entitled Philadelphia\n97\nSchool District v. Human Relations Commission, 6 Pa.Cmwlth. 281, 294 A.2d 410 (1972); and they present\ncertain legal questions in common. For those reasons, they are treated here in a single opinion.\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\na. The Commission's Amended Final Orders dated September 25,\n1972\nIn 1972, the Commonwealth Court considered the appeals of five school districts 00 including the Philadelphia and\n97\nPittsburgh School Districts 00 from orders of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (the \"Commission\"\n97\nor the \"PHRC\") directing each district to submit a plan to achieve racial balance in its public schools. After\nconsideration of such appeals, the Commonwealth Court remanded the cases to the PHRC for modification of its\norders in accordance with the Court's opinion after such further conferences, hearings, conciliation and\n[1]\npersuasion as the PHRC deemed appropriate.  Neither the School District of Philadelphia (\"Philadelphia\" or\n403 \"School District\") nor the School District *403 of Pittsburgh (\"Pittsburgh\" or \"School District\") took an appeal from\n[2]\nthat order.\nUpon remand and without any further proceedings, the PHRC rendered and served upon both Philadelphia and\nPittsburgh Amended Final Orders dated September 25, 1972 which, inter alia, required each school district to\nsubmit to the Commission by January 2, 1973 a plan that would eliminate racial imbalance in its schools in\nconformity with the Commission's \"Recommended Elements of a School Desegregation Plan\" (the\n\n\"Recommended Elements\") dated May 15, 1968 and in accordance with a timetable contained in its Amended\n[3]\nFinal Orders.\nb. Subsequent Proceedings in the Pittsburgh Case\nPursuant to the Commission's Amended Final Order and in accordance with an extension of time which the\nPHRC had granted to it, the Pittsburgh Board of Public Education submitted a school reorganization plan to the\nCommission on February 26, 1973. Thereafter, the PHRC advised the School District that, in the Commission's\nview, the proposed plan did not fully comply with the Amended Final Order, and the Commission sought\n[4]\nclarification from Pittsburgh as to why the District could not comply.\nDuring the period from 1973 through 1976, members and representatives of the Pittsburgh Board of Public\nEducation and of the Commission had various conferences and communications about the February 1973\n404 reorganization plan, the *404 actions taken by the School District to implement that plan and certain other\nreorganization plans which the District had under consideration. Although the School District apparently\nconsidered various amendments or alternatives to the February 1973 plan during the three year period following\nits submission, no such revised plan was ever formally adopted by the Board of Education or submitted to the\nCommission; the February 1973 plan is the only submission from Pittsburgh to the Commission. The various\nconferences between Pittsburgh and the Commission did not achieve any final resolution of their disagreements,\nand on August 18, 1976 the Commission, acting pursuant to Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act\n(the \"Act\"), Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. § 960, filed with the Commonwealth Court a\npetition for enforcement of its Amended Final Order of September 25, 1972.\nThe Commission's petition for enforcement was answered by the School District, and the matter was argued\n[5]\nbefore the Commonwealth Court.  The School District did not request an evidentiary hearing nor, insofar as the\nrecord before us indicates, did the District ever suggest that any evidentiary matters were pertinent to the issue\n405 before the court.[6] By *405 order dated January 13, 1977, the Commonwealth Court directed Pittsburgh to\nprepare and submit a definitive plan to the Commission \"to correct racial imbalance in its schools, in accordance\nwith the law and the Commission's guidelines.\" That order further directed that the School District's plan \"shall\nconform to the requirements of the Amended Final Order\" in all respects save that of the timetable contained\ntherein; in recognition of the passage of time during the course of the negotiations between Pittsburgh and the\nCommission, the court, in its order, established a new timetable for desegregation which the School District's new\nplan was to follow. In entering its order, the court noted that counsel for both parties had indicated that \"they\nwould be amenable to a resolution of this case by an order requiring [Pittsburgh] to submit a new plan for the\ncorrection of racial imbalance in the School District.\"\nFrom the Commonwealth Court's order of January 13, 1977 the Pittsburgh School District took a timely appeal to\nthis Court. On April 11, 1977, the PHRC filed a motion to quash the appeal and a brief in support of the motion. In\nthe interim, acting by counsel specially retained by it, the School District filed a petition for allowance of appeal,\n[7]\nand the Commission filed a brief in opposition to that petition.  By order dated August 5, 1977, we reserved\ndecision on the Commission's motion to quash and specifically directed the parties to brief and argue the\nfollowing questions:\n(1) Whether the School District is entitled to an appeal as a matter of right; and\n(2) Whether any of the issues raised by the School District had been waived or were res judicata as a result of\n406 the prior *406 proceedings before the Commission and Commonwealth Court.\nc. Subsequent Proceedings in the Philadelphia Case\nFollowing the entry of its Amended Final Order on September 25, 1972, the Commission granted several\nrequests by Philadelphia for extensions of time within which that District might submit a desegregation plan.\nWhen Philadelphia failed and refused to submit any plan to the Commission after the expiration of the deadline,\n\nas extended, the PHRC filed a Petition for Enforcement of its Amended Final Order with the Commonwealth\nCourt. After hearing, that court, by order dated November 14, 1973, granted the Commission's petition and\ndirected Philadelphia to submit to the Commission by February 15, 1974, a plan and timetable to eliminate the\n[8]\nracial imbalance of its schools in accordance with the Commission's Amended Final Order.\nFollowing the timely submission of a plan by Philadelphia in February, 1974, the Commission reviewed that plan\nand disapproved it as not being in compliance with its Amended Final Order and not containing any justification\n[9]\nfor such non-compliance as allowed in the order.  In consequence, on April 2, 1974, the Commission filed a\n407 second petition for *407 enforcement with the Commonwealth Court, requesting that the Philadelphia School\nDistrict be found in contempt of the court's order of November 14, 1973, and further requesting that the court act\nto effectuate compliance with that order. Following a further hearing, the court issued a Memorandum Order of\nJune 4, 1974, appointing Dr. David H. Kurtzman as an expert to examine the School District's February, 1974\nplan and to provide the court with recommendations or modifications of that plan which would put it in compliance\nwith the Commission's Amended Final Order or with reasons that would justify non-compliance. Dr. Kurtzman's\n[10]\nreport and recommendations were submitted to the court on August 29, 1974.  An evidentiary hearing was\nheld by the court of that report, and both the Commission and the Philadelphia School District presented\nevidence in opposition to the Kurtzman recommendation. Faced with that situation, the Commonwealth Court, by\norder dated October 1, 1974, directed both the Commission and the School District to prepare definitive plans for\nthe desegregation of the public schools of Philadelphia for submission to the court by January 31, 1975.\nFollowing a number of extensions of time which the court granted to the parties, both Philadelphia and the\n408 Commission filed plans with the court in July, 1975. Plans were also *408 filed by the intervenors Gwynne and\n[11]\ncertain other interested persons.  Hearings on those plans were held by the court in Philadelphia in August,\n1975, at which evidence was received from the parties, from the intervenors and from members of the general\npublic. The PHRC and the School District presented support for their own plans and produced objections to the\nother's proposals. After argument to the full court by all concerned parties, the Commonwealth Court found that\n[12] [13] [14]\nthe plans submitted by the Commission  and by the School District  were unsatisfactory.  Accordingly, by\n409 *409 opinion and order entered February 13, 1976, the Court \"reluctantly\" referred the matter back to the School\nDistrict with the direction that Philadelphia \". . . make a realistic and effective proposal to integrate its schools\n. . .\" Philadelphia was ordered to prepare and submit to the Commission for its review and approval a definitive\nplan and timetable for the desegregation of the Philadelphia public schools, together with a written justification for\neach instance in which it was proposed that a school should remain racially imbalanced. The order further\nrequired that the plan be submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education for its recommendations as to\neducational content, and that the submission to both the Commission and the Department be made by July 1,\n1976. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia, 23 Pa.Cmwlth. 312, 352\nA.2d 200 (1976).\nFollowing a one month extension granted by the court, Philadelphia submitted its July 1976 Desegregation Plan\n(the \"1976 Plan\") to the Commission. Thereafter, the Commission reviewed the 1976 Plan with the Department of\nEducation and with representatives of the School District. The Commission notified the District of certain\nconcerns which it had about the 1976 Plan, and the District responded to some of them. On September 27, 1976,\nthe Commission officially voted to disapprove the 1976 Plan and again initiate enforcement proceedings in the\n410 Commonwealth Court.[15]*410 Accordingly, on November 18, 1976, the Commission filed a third petition for\nenforcement seeking implementation of its Amended Final Order of September 25, 1972 and of the prior orders\nof the Commonwealth Court.\nIn response to that petition, the court convened a hearing on January 13, 1977, at which both parties presented\ntestimony and evidence. Following argument upon the enforcement petition and the legal sufficiency of the 1976\nPlan, the Commonwealth Court denied the Commission's petition for enforcement and directed the School\nDistrict to implement the 1976 Plan, as submitted. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District\nof Philadelphia, 30 Pa. Cmwlth. 644, 374 A.2d 1014 (1977). The Commission's appeal to this Court followed.\n\nTHE STATUS OF THESE APPEALS\nAt the outset, we are confronted with the anomaly of a motion to quash filed by the Commission in response to\nPittsburgh's appeal from the Commonwealth Court order granting the Commission's petition for enforcement and\na roughly contemporaneous direct appeal by the Commission from the Commonwealth Court order denying the\n[16]\npetition for enforcement which the Commission filed in the Philadelphia case.  We conclude that the instant\norders are appealable to this Court pursuant to the terms of Section 203 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of\n1970, Act No. 223, July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, 17 P.S. § 211.203.\nSection 203 provides that this Court \"shall have exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from all final orders of the\n411 Commonwealth *411 Court entered in any matter which was originally commenced in said court and which does\nnot constitute an appeal from . . . an administrative agency . . .\"\nEach of these cases involves \"final order[s] of the Commonwealth Court.\" In the Philadelphia action, the\nCommonwealth Court has denied the relief sought by the Commission; in the Pittsburgh action, the court has\ndenied the School District's request for relief and has required it to take certain further affirmative steps. In each\ncase, the court's order disposes of the entire matter before the court, and no piecemeal review is at issue. See \nPiltzer v. Independence F.S. & L. Assn., 456 Pa. 402, 319 A.2d 677 (1974).\nMoreover, we conclude that an enforcement proceeding which the PHRC initiates before the Commonwealth\nCourt constitutes a matter which is \"originally commenced\" in that court and that an appeal from the order of the\nCommonwealth Court which disposes of such an enforcement proceeding is not \"an appeal from . . . an\nadministrative agency.\" See Section 203, supra, of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act. The proceedings in these\nmatters have, of course, been pursued by and before the Commission itself, have involved extended conciliation\nefforts, the filing of a complaint, evidentiary hearings, extensive submissions, the review of submitted plans and\nnegotiations concerning such plans, and of course the entry of various orders by the Commission. In both of\nthese cases, however, the issues presented by the petitions for enforcement were originally addressed in the\n[17]\nCommonwealth Court.  The issues presented by these appeals do not directly involve determinations by the\nCommission itself; rather, they involve determinations by the Commonwealth Court 00 that Philadelphia has\n97\nsubstantially complied with the court's prior orders and that Pittsburgh is required to submit a desegregation plan\n412 pursuant to the Commission's Amended Final Order. The *412 issues presented by these appeals have not\npreviously been presented to an appellate court. Accordingly, we believe that these appeals are embraced by\nSection 203 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act and are appealable to this Court as of right. See \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Resources v. Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel\nCompany, 473 Pa. 432, 375 A.2d 320 (1977).\nTHE MERITS OF THESE APPEALS\na. The Pittsburgh Case\nThe January 13, 1977 order of the Commonwealth Court directs Pittsburgh to submit to the Commission \"a\ndefinitive plan to correct racial imbalance in its schools, in accordance with the law and the Commission's\nguidelines.\" That order sets forth with some specificity the nature of the plan which the School District shall follow\nand the procedures which shall apply to its review: it establishes a date for the submission of that plan; it directs\nthat the plan shall \"conform to the requirements of the Amended Final Order\"; it establishes a timetable for the\nelimination of racial imbalance which the plan shall meet; it requires the submission of the plan to the Department\nof Education for comment; it requires the Commission to approve or disapprove of the plan in whole or in part\nwith any objections to be set forth in writing with specificity; and it provides for the court's retention of jurisdiction\nover the matter.\nIn its opposition to the Commonwealth Court order, Pittsburgh advances a variety of arguments: that the filing of\na desegregation plan is not mandated by statute or regulation; that the Commonwealth Court exceeded its\n\njurisdiction under Section 10 of the Act by entering a new order which did not modify an order of the Commission\nand by failing to take testimony in connection with its entry of that order; that the order appealed from is contrary\nto law. In addition, the District contends that the order as drawn fails to take into consideration certain particular\n413 problems which the School District may have in achieving the prescribed *413 degree of desegregation on the\ntime schedule in question, requires more of the District than is practical or feasible, and departs from the case-by-\n[18]\ncase consideration of such matters mandated by statute and by this Court's prior decisions.\nTo a significant degree, much of the argument presented on behalf of the School District is either belated or\npremature.\nCertain of the positions advanced by the District have either been settled adversely to the District as a matter of\ngeneral law or, as explained more fully below, text at n. 19, were resolved by the District's prior appeal from the\nCommission's final order. School District of Philadelphia v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 6\nPa.Cmwlth. 281, 294 A.2d 410 (1972). Other positions advanced by the District cannot be resolved in the context\nof the present order requiring the submission of a plan but only in connection with a determination as to whether\na particular plan which the District may submit is satisfactory.\nAs an initial matter, Pittsburgh contends that it may not be required to file a plan with the Commission and that\nthe Commonwealth Court was without power to order that it do so. As a general proposition, however, the power\n414 of *414 the Commission to require a school district to prepare and submit a plan which addresses the problems\nof school segregation in a realistic and meaningful fashion is a settled issue. The power of the Commonwealth\nCourt to enforce such orders of the Commission is equally settled. Indeed, Pittsburgh concedes that, under\nexisting case law, the Commission may take action against racial segregation which is found to exist within the\nstudent population of a school district within the Commonwealth. See Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, §§ 5(i)\n(1) and 9, Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. §§ 955(i)(1) and 959; Uniontown Area School\nDistrict v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 455 Pa. 52, 313 A.2d 156 (1973); Pennsylvania Human\nRelations Commission v. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A.2d 290 (1967); see also, Balsbaugh v.\nRowland, 447 Pa. 423, 290 A.2d 85 (1972).\nMoreover, the Pittsburgh School District has heretofore unsuccessfully challenged the Commission's power to\norder it to submit a plan to achieve racial balance in its public schools. The Commission's final order of June 18,\n1971 (the subject of the appeal by Pittsburgh which was decided adversely to it in School District of Philadelphia\nv. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 6 Pa.Cmwlth. 281, 294 A.2d 410 (1972)) paralleled almost\nprecisely the order of the Commonwealth Court here under review and was subject to a substantially similar\nattack by the School District. As indicated above, the District's appeal from the Commission's original final order\n[19]\nwas denied, and no appeal was thereafter taken by the District from that adjudication.  Thus, the basic power\nof the Commonwealth, through its instrumentalities, to act in this area is established, and the School District's\npresent challenge to that power is doubly belated by reason of the prior proceedings in this matter.\nMoving from its general attack upon the powers of the Commission and the Commonwealth Court to a more\n415 particular *415 attack upon the nature of the order at issue, the Pittsburgh District contends that the court's order\nof January 17, 1977 is erroneous in two respects: (i) the court ordered a new timetable which the District's\nprojected plan would be required to reflect without there having been an evidentiary hearing on the timetable; and\n(ii) the court failed to take into consideration particular problems which the District would face in complying with\nany such order.\nWith respect to the first point, we believe the court was clearly within its rights in entering a new timetable without\nan evidentiary hearing. The timetable in question parallels the timetable contained in the Commission's original\nfinal order which was, in the main, upheld by the Commonwealth Court in 1972, supra,6 Pa.Cmwlth. 281, 294\nA.2d 410, and in the Amended Final Order which the Commission entered upon remand of the matter from the\nCommonwealth Court. The order in question merely takes into account the time which had elapsed while the\nDistrict's prior plan was in preparation by the School Board and under review by the Commission and while the\nBoard and the Commission were engaged in negotiations over the most effective way to move against\nsegregation within the Pittsburgh school district. In view of the averments contained in the petition for\nenforcement and the School District's response thereto, it is not clear what basis there might have been for an\n\nevidentiary hearing, and as noted above, the record before us contains no suggestion that the School District\never requested such a hearing or sought to present additional evidence to the Commonwealth Court. We find no\nerror in the Court's disposition of the petition for enforcement and its entry of an order without holding a further\nevidentiary hearing.\nThe School District's second contention, on the other hand 00 that the court's order fails to take into consideration\n97\nvarious factors which make it impossible for Pittsburgh to desegregate its schools in such a fashion as to comply\nfully with the Commission's Guidelines 00 is, in the main, premature. The District is being directed to devise and\n97\n416 submit for *416 review a plan; it has not been required to take particular actions to implement such a plan, and\nthe plan which it submits, together with any action by the Commission thereon, will be subject to further judicial\nscrutiny. In the initial proceeding before the Commonwealth Court, the court took cognizance of the contention,\npursued principally by the Philadelphia School District, that full scale desegregation was beyond the District's\nfiscal resources; the court noted that such matters could not be reasonably assessed until a minimum acceptable\nplan had been prepared and analyzed. A similar response is appropriate in this case. While there may be\ncircumstances which provide persuasive justification for the acceptance and implementation of a plan which fails\nto achieve complete desegregation of Pittsburgh's schools, such factors should be offered in justification of a\nparticular plan and not in defense of an order which merely requires the initial submission of a plan.\n[20]\nIn one respect, however, we believe the position advanced by the School District  is meritorious, i.e., the\ndegree to which the Commonwealth Court's order appears to incorporate the Commission's \"Recommended\nElements\" and to mandate an adherence to those Elements which is more stringent than the Commission itself\nwould require.\nInitially, it should be noted that the status of the Recommended Elements has recently been considered by this\nCourt, and the Court's rulings on that issue were not available to the Commonwealth Court at the time it entered\nits order of January 17, 1977 from which this appeal is taken. See Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v.\nNorristown Area School District, 473 Pa. 334, 374 A.2d 671 (1977). In that case, the defendant school district\nchallenged the Commission's Recommended Elements as an invalid regulation which had been promulgated by\nthe Commission without regard to the publication requirements of the Administrative Agency Law, as superseded\nby the Commonwealth Documents Law, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 769, No. 240, as amended, 45 P.S. § 1101 et\n417 seq. This Court noted that the *417 Commission had taken the position that the guidelines were not in fact\nbinding administrative regulations having the force of law but were rather \"general policy statements. . . made\n. . . to aid school districts in developing plans which the Commission will find acceptable.\" Id.473 Pa. at 347, 374\nA.2d at 678. This Court then quoted with approval the following observation of Commonwealth Court:\n\"The Commission's document, `Recommended Elements of a School Desegregation Plan,' as its\ntitle suggests, does not lay down hard and fast standards with which districts must comply in order\nto conform to the law. It merely poses questions concerning the plan for integration as means of\ntesting the plan's chances of proving acceptable to the Commission. The questions are most\ngeneral in nature and there is nothing in the document which states or implies that nonconformity\nof the plan in any respect will bring automatic rejection.\" Id.473 Pa. at 348, 374 A.2d at 678,\nquoting Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Norristown Area School District, 20\nPa.Cmwlth. 555, 560, 342 A.2d 464, 467 (1975).\nMoreover, the Commonwealth Court in the Norristown case had noted that the Commission's order was\n\"inconsistent with the Commission's position that the guidelines were statements of policies and not binding\nregulations.\" In response to that decision, the Commission modified its order to \"permit Norristown to develop and\nsubmit a desegregation plan which did not conform to the `Recommended Elements of a School Desegregation\nPlan' if persuasive justification was presented.\" Id.473 Pa. at 348, n. 29, 374 A.2d at 679, n. 29. This Court\ngranted the Commission leave to supplement the record and to file its order, as amended, with the Court; it is that\nmodified order which this Court upheld.\nThe same inconsistency between the order at issue on the one hand and the position of the Commission (and the\nstatus of the Recommended Elements) on the other is apparent in the case at bar. The January 13, 1977 order of\n418 the Commonwealth *418 Court requires the District to submit a plan which is in accordance with \"the\n\nCommission's guidelines\" and with the Commission's Amended Final Order; the Amended Final Order in turn\nincorporates by reference and requires compliance with the Commission's Recommended Elements. As noted\nabove, Pittsburgh contends that such requirements effectively determine the nature of the plan, without taking\ninto account the recent developments in Pittsburgh or the particular problems which the School District may have\nin complying with such an order. In response, the Commission stresses that it \"has never maintained that the\nRecommended Elements are hard and fast standards to which Districts must adhere or that noncompliance will\nbring automatic rejection of a plan.\" (Brief, p. 19). It expressly endorses the view stated by this Court in the \nNorristown case, i.e., that \"the Elements are statements of policy indicative of a plan's chances of proving\nacceptable to the Commission\" and it represents that the Commission itself will proceed in this case as in other\ncases in accordance with its statutory mandate calling for a case-by-case examination of particular local\nproblems and projected remedies.\nIn view of the decision in Norristown, supra, and in view of the clear inconsistency between the Commission's\nrepresentation that the Recommended Elements are flexible guidelines and the provisions of the order of the\nCommonwealth Court mandating strict adherence to the Recommended Elements, we believe it appropriate to\n[21]\nremand this matter to the Commonwealth Court for the entry of an order consistent with this opinion.\nThat order should make clear the District's obligation to prepare and submit a plan which addresses the problem\nof school desegregation in good faith and in realistic fashion. The District's Plan should take into account the\nRecommended Elements and the significance they will have for the deliberations of the Commission in its review\n419 of the plan. *419 The order should, however, provide some degree of flexibility in recognition of the fact that a\nplan which fails to satisfy some aspect of the Recommended Elements may prove acceptable if the District\ndemonstrates that substantial and persuasive justification exists for any such departure.\nb. The Philadelphia Case\nThe 1976 Plan submitted to the PHRC by Philadelphia is an attempt to achieve desegregation in the Philadelphia\nschools on a wholly voluntary basis. The 1976 Plan calls for an intensive planning and refinement of the Plan's\ncomponents during the school year 1977-78, followed by implementation of the following programs beginning\nwith the school year 1978-79: magnet schools; an open enrollment/voluntary transfer program; inter-system\ncooperation between the public and parochial schools; and the creation of skill centers and other new or\nexpanded programs. Certain of these programs would involve participating students in integrated settings for\nsome but not all of their school days. Participation in all of these programs would be left to the individual choice of\nthe students and their parents. The 1976 Plan contained projections of the numbers of students that the School\nDistrict anticipated might participate in the different Plan elements. Given the voluntary character of the Plan and\nits elements, the 1976 Plan could not identify with certainty the degree of desegregation that would result from its\nimplementation; the District's projections, however, reflect a potential desegregating impact on anywhere from\n[22]\n70,000 to 160,000 of the District's 265,000 students over the course of the 1976 Plan's implementation.  The\nPlan did not indicate what response the School District would have if the various program elements failed to\nsecure a degree of desegregation which it deemed satisfactory.\nIn addition to these program elements, the 1976 Plan anticipated that four categories of schools within the District\n420 were to be excluded from its operation and were to be *420 allowed to continue to exist as they had previously.\nThese four categories were as follows: 1) Special Education Centers, those drawing city-wide and serving a\nspecific pupil population requiring special services; 2) schools with concentrations of Spanish surnamed pupils\n(20% or more) and with special language problems; 3) schools not quite meeting the Human Relations\nCommission's guidelines as desegregated schools but which have a degree of racial balance and which have\nhigh achievement levels based on standardized Test Scores; and 4) schools meeting the Pennsylvania Human\nRelations Commission's guidelines as desegregated schools. Approximately 60,000 students are currently\nenrolled in the schools in these four categories.\nIn response to the 1976 Plan, the PHRC advised the School District in writing that there were twelve matters\nwhich constituted \"some of the factors which must be considered by the district in preparing a plan which will be\nacceptable to the Commission.\" By letter dated September 23, 1976, the District advised the Commission that\n\n[23]\nthe Board of Education had agreed to commit itself in principle to nine of those factors.  With respect to the\nremaining three factors the District advised the Commission that the Board of Education would consider certain\n421 involuntary reassignments *421 at the meeting of the Board to be held in October, 1976,[24] but that the Board\nhad not endorsed the Commission's recommendation that it develop an involuntary reassignment contingency\nplan and that the Board was not fully in accord with the Commission with respect to racial admissions controls.\n[25]\n Finally, the School District advised the PHRC that the Board of Education was willing to continue to work with\nthe Commission in the further development of the 1976 Plan.\nAs recited above, the Commission disapproved Philadelphia's 1976 Plan, and explained its reasons for so doing\n422 by letter to the School District dated November 10, 1976.[26]*422 Thereafter, the PHRC filed the petition for\nenforcement, and, as noted above, the Commonwealth Court denied that petition, approved the District's 1976\nPlan and ordered its implementation, while retaining jurisdiction over the action. The court specifically stipulated\nthat in the event the Commission determined by February of 1980 that the Plan was not accomplishing\ndesegregation as required by Pennsylvania law, the Commission might petition the court for such further action\nas it deemed appropriate.\nThe issue before us is whether the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that the School District's submission of\nthe 1976 Plan constituted adequate compliance with that court's order of February 13, 1976 directing that the\nSchool District \"make a realistic and effective proposal to integrate its schools.\"\nThe Commission vigorously contends that the Commonwealth Court abused its discretion and committed an\nerror of law in approving the 1976 Plan. Our reading of the record before this Court belies the Commission's\ncontention that the Commonwealth Court's conclusion was without support in the record. We conclude that the\ncourt had a sufficient basis for its approval of the 1976 Plan and that no abuse of discretion or error of law was\ncommitted. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.\n423 *423 As noted above, the extended discussions and negotiations between the Commission and the School\nDistrict have left essentially three points in dispute: (i) the District's unwillingness to develop an involuntary\nreassignment plan for implementation in the event the voluntary aspects of the 1976 Plan prove ineffective; (ii)\nthe District's unwillingness to achieve some immediate desegregation by means of pairing schools or redrawing\nthe lines of contiguous school attendance districts; and (iii) the District's identification of four categories of\nschools which were outside the operation of the Plan.\nThe first of these issues 00 the absence of any involuntary reassignment component 00 is part and parcel of the\n97 97\nCommission's conviction that the proposed voluntary plan elements will prove ineffective. In that connection, the\nPHRC contends that the Commonwealth Court's \"refusal to be guided by the uncontradicted testimony of the\nCommission's expert witness concerning the failure of voluntary desegregation plans in other school districts\"\ncompels the conclusion that the court had erred. At the hearing before the Commonwealth Court, the PHRC\n[27]\nplaced principal reliance upon the testimony of its expert, Dr. Gordon Foster.\nDr. Foster stated his objections to, and his reservations concerning the likely efficacy of, the 1976 Plan and its\nreliance upon voluntary techniques. He prefaced his testimony, however, with the following observation:\n\"First of all, I'd certainly like to state that volunteerism in the North and West is certainly not a\nclosed chapter. It's something that is experimental and several districts are trying it with different\nfailures and successes. A lot of people feel that it may make a certain amount of sense in different\nways and it is an experimental program and certainly nobody can definitively say it doesn't work or\nit works or whatever at this juncture.\"\n424 *424 In the face of that general disclaimer, Dr. Foster stated his opinion as to the desegregation potential in the\nvarious proposed program elements of the 1976 Plan. With respect to magnet schools, Dr. Foster testified that\n\"the possibilities of considerable desegregation over a period of time certainly would be fair in this program.\" He\nfurther testified that he believed the School District's estimate of 40,000 potentially affected students was \"pretty\noptimistic\" because of the locations of the schools which had been tentatively suggested as magnet schools.\nWith respect to open enrollment and voluntary transfers, Foster testified that programs of that type had\n\ntraditionally drawn no more than 3% to 5% of a district's pupils; that range, if accomplished, would coincide with\nthe lower range of the School District's own estimate of the potential for this phase of the program. Dr. Foster\ntestified that the District's proposed inter-system and shared-time programs would affect a small number of\nstudents and in his opinion did not involve genuine school desegregation but simply part-time desegregation.\nFinally, Dr. Foster testified that of the balance of the proposed educational components, the \"academics plus\"\nprogram offered some effective solution to desegregation but that the remaining programs had not been\nsufficiently worked out to allow a reasonable projection of their desegregation effect.\nIn conclusion, Dr. Foster gave it as his opinion that, based on the experience of other school systems around the\ncountry, \"the chances are that a completely voluntary plan by itself would achieve some measure of\ndesegregation. I don't think any of us know how much.\" Dr. Foster then stated his \"guess\" that the 1976 Plan\nwould result in desegregation of between 10% and 15% of the school population; he thought that volunteerism\ncombined with some measure of actual mandated desegregation would \"make all the sense in the world.\"\nWith respect to the second major issue 00 the absence of any immediate desegregation obtained through\n97\ninvoluntary pupil assignments 00 the PHRC placed principal reliance upon the testimony of Richard B. Anliot, the\n97\n425 Commission's Director *425 of Education. Anliot testified that as an initial matter the School District might achieve\nsubstantial immediate desegregation by means of pairing thirty-three schools having 23,000 students. Anliot\nconceded on cross-examination, however, that several of the pairings proposed by the Commission itself would\nnot yield schools which were desegregated in accordance with the Commission's guidelines. Indeed, the\nevidence presented by witnesses called by the School District indicated that six of the PHRC's sixteen proposed\npairings (involving fourteen of the schools in question) would not bring the schools within the Commission's\n[28]\nguidelines  and that seven other proposed pairings (involving fifteen schools) would entail significant traveling\ndistances between the attendance districts, the potential disruption of special programs at certain of the schools\nor disparities between the grade level organization of the schools in question. Thus, the evidence before the\nCommonwealth Court identified only five potential pairings involving less than 7,000 students which were not\nsubject to substantial dispute.\nOver against the testimony offered by the Commission with respect to the prospects of voluntary desegregation\nand possible mandatory assignments, the School District offered evidence from the president of the Philadelphia\nHome and School Council, an organization representing the parents of Philadelphia school district children, to the\neffect that the Council endorsed the District's proposed voluntary plan and was prepared to work towards its\nsuccess; the District's Coordinator of External Operations, who had had responsibility for preparing the 1976\nPlan, also testified as to the District's belief that the voluntary program elements were more likely to obtain\n426 support and prove successful if they *426 were not combined with involuntary elements or contingency plans\nwhich were likely to attract substantial opposition.\nWith respect to the third issue of dispute 00 the District's exclusion of four categories of schools from the Plan's\n97\n[29]\noperation  00 reference should again be made to the testimony of Dr. Foster. Dr. Foster testified that he found\n97\nnothing objectionable in the District's proposed exclusion of schools drawing from the city as a whole and having\na student population requiring special services or in its exclusion of schools which met the PHRC's guidelines as\n[30]\ndesegregated schools.  With respect to the category of schools having more than twenty percent Spanish\nsurnamed students, Dr. Foster testified that in his opinion such schools should be desegregated (i.e., the Spanish\nsurnamed students should be dispersed) in a way that would guarantee a continuing quality of bilingual\neducation, but he also testified that certain of the schools in question already met the Commission's\ndesegregation guidelines. Moreover, Dr. Foster stated that in his opinion some deviation from the Commission's\nRecommended Elements was warranted in situations involving ethnic isolation, i.e., significant concentrations of\n[31]\nSpanish surnamed students.\n427 *427 In sum, ninety-one schools were embraced by the four categories which the School District intends to leave\noutside the operation of the 1976 Plan; the testimony offered by the PHRC with respect to these categorical\nexclusions indicates that more than two-thirds of the exclusions were unobjectionable to and deemed warranted\nby the Commission's own expert. Thus, even with respect to this point of dispute, the actual difference between\nthe District and the Commission is substantially narrower than at first appears.\n\nIn approving the District's 1976 Plan, the Commonwealth Court noted its understanding of the PHRC's concern\nthat the Plan might not effect a sufficient level of integration. It stated its reluctance to mandate specific school\npairings or specific student transfers until \"those charged with the responsibility of administering the schools have\nhad a reasonable opportunity to implement a plan which they feel will accomplish desegregation with a minimum\n[32]\nof disruption and a maximum of educational value.\"  While we share the concern of that court as to the degree\nto which the Plan may accomplish desegregation, we cannot find on the present record that the court erred or\nabused its discretion in concluding that the Plan sufficiently complied with the court's own order of February 16,\n1976 and was worthy of implementation.\n428 On the record before it, the Commonwealth Court had (1) evidence from the Commission that a plan of voluntary \n*428 desegregation would achieve some measure of desegregation, the degree of which was beyond anyone's\nknowledge; (2) evidence from the School District that such a plan would be most likely to elicit support from the\nconstituencies of the schools; (3) evidence from the Commission and from the School District that the\nCommission's own proposed school pairings in many cases failed to achieve the intended level of desegregation\nor were subject to other substantial criticism; and (4) evidence that the District's proposed exclusion of certain\nschools from the operation of the Plan was, in the main, acceptable to the Commission's own witness. That\nevidence must be viewed in the light of the Commonwealth Court's prior experience with the problem before it: in\nthe preceding eight years, the parties had been unable to resolve their differences and produce a mutually\nsatisfactory plan of desegregation; during that same period, neither the School District nor a distinguished outside\nexpert nor the Commission itself had been able to formulate an acceptable plan. Finally, that evidence must be\nviewed in the light of this Court's long-held position that \"the School District bears primary responsibility for the\nchoice and implementation of an effective desegregation program.\" Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission\nv. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 181, 233 A.2d 290, 302 (1967).\nIn view of the evidence before the Commonwealth Court, its extensive experience with the disputes in question\nand the applicable legal standards, we cannot conclude that the Commonwealth Court erred or abused its\ndiscretion in approving Philadelphia's 1976 Plan, directing its implementation, and retaining jurisdiction over the\nmatter for the purpose of considering the actual success of the 1976 Plan in operation. If, in practice, the Plan\nfails to achieve an acceptable level of desegregation or if the Plan is not in fact implemented in good faith, the\nCommonwealth Court may take such further action as is required. What is required at this point is a plan which\ncan be put into operation and which can move the present situation off dead center. The Commonwealth Court's\n429 order achieves at least that much. *429 We echo its hope that this plan, in Judge Wilkinson's words, \"may well be\n`the light at the end of the tunnel.'\" If by February 1980 this hope is disappointed, it will then be necessary for the\nCommonwealth Court to take \"such further action as it then deems appropriate.\"\nCONCLUSION\nAppeal at No. 103 March Term, 1977\n(The Pittsburgh case)\nIn this appeal the order of the Commonwealth Court entered January 13, 1977 is affirmed insofar as it directs the\nSchool District of Pittsburgh to submit to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission a definitive plan to\ncorrect racial imbalance in its schools. With respect to the remainder of said order the six justices participating in\nthe decision of that appeal are evenly divided:\nEAGEN, C.J., and O'BRIEN and POMEROY, JJ., would vacate the same and remand to the Commonwealth\nCourt for modification thereof in accordance with Mr. Justice POMEROY's opinion (see supra at 1248), and for\nsuch further adjustment of the time schedule for compliance as may be appropriate in light of the time consumed\nby this appeal.\n\nROBERTS, NIX and MANDERINO, JJ., would also vacate the remainder of the order in the Pittsburgh case, but,\ninstead of remanding, would have this Court enter a final order which incorporates the modifications it deems\nproper, as set forth in Part III of the dissenting opinion of NIX, J., infra.\nLARSEN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision in the case at No. 103 March Term, 1977.\nPACKEL, former J., did not participate in the decision in the case at No. 103 March Term, 1977.\n430 Appeal at No. 572 January Term, 1977\n*430\n(The Philadelphia case)\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court entered July 1, 1977 is affirmed.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion with respect to both appeals in which ROBERTS and MANDERINO, JJ., join.\nAPPENDIX \"A\"\nMAY 15, 1968\nRecommended Elements of a School Desegregation Plan\nby\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission\nand\nDepartment of Public Instruction\n1. Does the desegregation plan indicate the projected racial composition of each elementary and secondary\nschool attendance area and the racial composition of the total staff of each building as of the completion dates of\neach step?\n2. Does the desegregation plan identify the location of proposed school building construction sites?\n3. How nearly does the desegregation plan bring the per cent Negro pupils in each building to within 30% of the\nper cent Negro pupils among the buildings of the same grade span?\n4. Does the desegregation plan include procedures to affirmatively and effectively recruit and assign an\nintegrated staff at all levels for all schools?\n5. Does the desegregation plan correct any untoward concentrations of professional or non-professional Negro\nstaff in any buildings?\n6. Does the desegregation plan equally match the services of its professional staff and program with the\neducational needs of each school building?\n431 *431 7. Does the desegregation plan include plans for in-service training of staff to meet the needs and problems\nincident to the implementation of desegregation plans?\n\n8. Does the desegregation plan include steps to include intergroup education programming and the inclusion of\nthe contributions of Negroes and other racial and ethnic groups in the history courses about Pennsylvania and\nthe United States?\n9. Does the desegregation plan include a timetable indicating deadline dates by which each step will be\ncompleted? Are these dates as early as possible?\n10. Does the desegregation plan indicate involvement of the community in its development and implementation?\n11. Is the desegregation plan consistent with the Long Range Development Plan submitted to the Department of\nPublic Instruction?\nNIX, Justice, dissenting.\nIn view of the ten year history in which these two School Districts have resisted their obligation to devise and\nimplement a realistic and effective desegregation plan for their respective districts, I am at a loss to understand\nthe Commonwealth Court's and this Court's willingness to accept a belated voluntary plan as being in compliance\nwith the previous directives of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (Commission) and the prior\norders of the Commonwealth Court. I fail to perceive any transformation that could cause a reasonable person to\nbelieve that a District which has demonstrated such reluctance in the past to come to grips with the serious\nproblems of racial imbalance within its school population will now, without any coercive stimulant, aggressively\nseek the eradication of this evil. The majority opinion fails to reach the critical issue presented in these appeals,\ni.e. the scope of review of the Commonwealth Court in an enforcement proceeding of this nature. Finally, I\nbelieve the majority has reached issues which were unnecessary to the resolution of the lawsuits before us and\n432 that its decision to dispose of these questions *432 on the record before us was jurisprudentially unsound. I\ntherefore dissent.\nI. SCOPE OF REVIEW\nWhile the issue of the appropriate scope of review of the Commonwealth Court in an action for enforcement\nbrought by the Commission under section 10 of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (Act) of October 27,\n1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. § 960 (Supp. 1978-79), is applicable to both cases, I will in this opinion\ndiscuss the question within the framework of the Philadelphia case since in that instance it provides the basis for\nmy reaching a result different from that reached by the majority. It is, however, to be understood that in each\ninstance the appropriate scope of review is the same in my judgment. The Commission contends, and I agree,\nthat the \"substantial evidence test\" is the standard by which the Commonwealth Court was required to review the\nrecommendations and findings of the Commission in this matter.\nNo area is more amenable to the administrative agency concept than that of human relations. Because of the\npervasive and insidious nature of discrimination it can only be effectively attacked on a case-by-case basis by an\nagency that has developed an expertise in ascertaining its presence and in the designing of remedies to combat\n433 it.[1] This Court *433 has recognized that courts, with their numerous areas of concern and their ever increasing\ncase loads, are particularly unsuited to assume such a task:\n\"Moreover, having expressed its findings and goals in an early section, the Legislature\nundoubtedly envisioned a case-by-case approach to the elimination of racial imbalance in public\nschools. Most observers agree that when courts are forced to devise and supervise programs\nwhose goal is the elimination of racial imbalance they are acting in an area alien to their expertise.\nThese observers would prefer to see de facto segregation attacked by the community itself\nutilizing other organs of the government. The Human Relations Commission, whose function is to\nwork with the parties to the dispute in an attempt to alleviate the source of the friction through\n`conference, conciliation and persuasion,' and whose procedure is considerably more flexible than\nthe courts, is, as the Legislature recognized, better equipped to deal with this problem than the\ncourts. `In each case, the interests protected by adherence to neighborhood attendance zones\n\nmust be weighed against the substantiality of the racial imbalance in the community's schools. An\nagency such as the Human Relations Commission is best equipped to make these difficult\njudgments, and flexible enough to enter appropriate remedial orders.'\"\nPa. Human Rel. Com. v. Chester School Dist., 427 Pa. 157, 179, 233 A.2d 290, 301-302 (1967)\n(footnote omitted).\nThe General Assembly established the Commission and charged it with the responsibility \"[t]o formulate policies\nto effectuate the purposes of [that] act\" and to \"initiate, receive, investigate and pass upon complaints\" charging\n434 unlawful discriminatory practices. 43 P.S. § 957 (1964 & *434 Supp. 1978-79). The Commission must first seek\ncompliance through \"conference, conciliation and persuasion.\" Id. § 956 (Supp. 1978-79). If this approach proves\ninadequate, the Commission is then empowered to hold hearings, make findings of fact, and issue final orders. \nId. Such final orders are reviewable under section 10 of the Act in accordance with the terms of the Administrative\nAgency Law, 71 P.S. § 1710.41 (1962 & Supp. 1978-79). 43 P.S. § 960 (Supp. 1978-79). Where an appeal of the\norder is taken pursuant to section 10 by an aggrieved party, it is clear that the Commonwealth Court has\n[2]\naccepted that its scope of review is limited to the substantial evidence test.  In Midland Hts. Homes v. Pa.\nHuman Rel. Com., 17 Pa.Cmwlth. 563, 565-566, 333 A.2d 516, 517 (1975), that court stated:\n435 *435 \"As stated in Section 10 of the Act, 43 P.S. § 960 (Supp. 1974-1975), our scope of review is\ngoverned by the Administrative Agency Law, Act of June 4, 1945, P.L. 1388, as amended, 71 P.S.\n§ 1710.1 et seq., whereby we are to determine whether the Commission's adjudication `is not in\naccordance with law' or whether `any finding of fact made by the agency and necessary to support\nits adjudication is not supported by substantial evidence.' See Wilkinsburg School District v.\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 6 Pa.Cmwlth. 378, 295 A.2d 609 (1972).\nAlthough on this record, we, if we had been the factfinders, might have reached a contrary\ndetermination, nevertheless, we must conclude that there is sufficient substantial evidence to\nsupport the Commission's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\"\nI can find no justification for interpreting section 10 as allowing a broader scope of review where the\nCommonwealth Court is called upon to enforce the Commission's order than the court has in reviewing the\npropriety of the order in the first instance. Particularly where the requested enforcement only entails the court's\nreview of the Commission's judgment that a submitted plan by the District is not in compliance with an order the\ncourt has already considered and found appropriate, I find no reason why that court should be allowed to\n436 substitute its judgment.[3] It is clear *436 that the judgment in such a case is the type that is expected to be within\nthe agency's expertise. Where the agency is forced to depend upon the courts for the enforcement function, the\nagency's role becomes merely advisory in nature if the court is allowed to substitute its judgment for that of the\nagency. Instructive on this issue is the language of this Court in Com. Dept. of Environmental Resources v. Pa.\nPower Co., 461 Pa. 675, 693-95 & n.17, 337 A.2d 823, 832-833 & n.17 (1975):\n\"The confusion over that which transpired below lies in the fact that neither the Clean Air Act nor\nthe Air Pollution Control Act anticipate that a court would prepare its own order to abate air\npollution without `agency assistance.' The Acts provide for an Administrative Process, i.e., the\napplication of state standards to specific sources through agency orders and a court's `enforcing\nfunction' to compel compliance with such agency orders. See 35 P.S. § 4001 et seq. and 42\nU.S.C.A. § 1857 et seq. Under these Acts, if an agency order or decision is challenged, review is\nlimited to administrative review.\nHere, unlike other cases in this area, the `enforcing court,' in what appears to be a good faith\n437 attempt to *437 ameliorate an already drawn out conflict between PPC and the DER, formulated\nits own order, including its own commitment date. `Agency input' as anticipated by the statutes\nwas never added and consequently had not been reviewed.\"\n.....\n\n\"It is important to note that the DER was given the opportunity to make a `reviewable' decision but\nchose instead to file for contempt. Had the DER decided to pass on the acceptability of the PPC\napplication, state administrative remedies would have become available and likewise court review\nof agency findings. See North American Coal Corp. v. Air Pollution Commission, 2 Pa. Cmwlth.\n469, 279 A.2d 356 (1971); Standard Lime and Refractories Company v. Department of\nEnvironmental Resources, 2 Pa.Cmwlth. 434, 279 A.2d 383 (1971). Only in this context (pursuant\nto Pennsylvania Administrative Agency Law, 71 P.S. § 1710.4) would judicial review have been as\nlimited as DER now suggests.17\n17 Review of an agency decision permits the court to ask only whether `based on the full record before the\nagency, the agency's action was arbitrary capricious or an abuse of discretion.' See Commonwealth v. Harmar\nCoal Company, 452 Pa. 77, 306 A.2d 308 (1973); Blumenschein v. Pittsburgh Housing Authority, 379 Pa. 566,\n109 A.2d 331 (1954); and Bortz Coal Company v. Commonwealth, 2 Pa.Cmwlth. 441, 279 A.2d 388 (1971). Here,\nhowever, there was no decision on record by the agency.\nThe pertinent language of section 10 provides:\n\"When the Commission has heard and decided any complaint brought before it, enforcement of its\norder shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in such court, together with a transcript of the\nrecord of the hearing before the Commission, and issuance and service of a copy of said petition\nas in proceedings in equity. When enforcement of a Commission order is sought, the court may\nmake and enter, upon the pleadings, testimony and proceedings set forth in such transcript, an\norder or decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside, in whole or in\npart, the order of the Commission, . .\"\n438 *438 43 P.S. § 960 (Supp. 1978-79).\nThis Court has stated:\n\"The canons of statutory construction require that a statute be read in a manner which will\neffectuate its purpose, a task which compels consideration of more than the statute's literal words.\nE.g., Chartiers Valley Joint Schools v. Allegheny County Bd. of School Directors, 418 Pa. 520, 211\nA.2d 487 (1965); Rossiter v. Whitpain Twp., 404 Pa. 201, 170 A.2d 586 (1961); New York Life Ins.\nCo. v. Guaranty Corp., 321 Pa. 359, 184 A. 31 (1936); Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1019, 46 P.S. §\n551. In ascertaining this legislative purpose, especially when the act in question is a manifestation\nof a fundamental policy of the Commonwealth, courts may properly consider the historical setting\nwhich gave impetus to its enactment. See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Guaranty Corp., supra; \nOrlosky v. Haskell, 304 Pa. 57, 155 A. 112 (1931); 50 Am.Jur. § 295 (1944). Thus even if we\nassume arguendo that the interpretation we have adopted is not apparent solely from the wording\nof the statute, any latent ambiguity disappears once we examine the circumstances of its\npassage.\"\nPa. H.R.C. v. Chester School Dist., supra, 427 Pa. at 166-67, 233 A.2d at 295. First, the language of the statute\ngives rise to an inference that the court should confine its consideration to the record as developed during the\nproceedings before the agency. I do not accept the majority's liberal interpretation which would permit the\nCommonwealth Court to take additional testimony. Second, there is nothing in the Act that suggests that the\nCommonwealth Court is at liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the Commission. As has been stated, the\nlegislature clearly intended that the Commission serve as an organ to ferret out and eradicate discriminatory\npractices. If we interpret section 10 as allowing the Commonwealth Court to have a scope of review beyond the\n439 substantial evidence test, we are therefore again relegating the Commission to an advisory capacity only and \n*439 vesting in the court the ultimate judgment in these matters. To do so would clearly frustrate the legislative\nintention of creating an agency with the expertise in the area and vesting within that agency the power to carry\nout the purposes of the Act.\nThe United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873\n(1954), crystallized the responsibility of government to eliminate segregation within the schools of this nation.\n\nThat concept, as it has evolved, has required that all reasonable methods be available to formulate an effective\nremedy. North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 46, 91 S.Ct. 1284, 28 L.Ed.2d 586 (1971); Pa.\nH.R.C. v. Chester Sch. Dist., supra. Any decision to require less would contravene the mandate that every effort\nmust be made to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the\npracticalities of the situation. Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile Co., 402 U.S. 33, 37, 91 S.Ct.\n1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971). See also Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d\n548 (1973); Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968). Moreover the\nfact that the realization of this responsibility first occurred in situations involving de jure segregation does not\nlessen the responsibility where offensive racial imbalance is present as a result of de facto segregation. Pa.\nH.R.C. v. Chester Sch. Dist., supra:\n\"In 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States ushered in a new era of constitutional\ndevelopment when it held segregated educational facilities deprived children of minority groups\nthe opportunity to obtain an education equal to that received by their Caucasian counterparts. \nBrown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). The consolidated\ncases decided in Brown involved areas where the state gave active support to a dual system of\nschools, and for several years the greatest emphasis was placed upon achieving compliance with\n440 the Supreme Court's mandate in the southern states. See, e. *440 g., Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S.\n1, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5, 19 (1958). However, Negro leaders recognized that their children\nwere not receiving equal educational opportunities in northern communities, where the schools\nwere frequently segregated on a de facto basis, and in the late fifties they began to focus their\nattention on this problem. See, e.g., Taylor v. Board of Educ. of New Rochelle, 191 F.Supp. 181\n(S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 294 F.2d 36 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 940, 82 S.Ct. 382, 7 L.Ed.2d 339\n(1961).\" Id.427 Pa. at 167, 233 A.2d at 295.\nWhen the substantial evidence test is employed to the recommendation and request of the Commission in the\nPhiladelphia case it is, in my judgment, evident that there was a rational basis for the position urged by the\nCommission, and that the Commonwealth Court abused its discretion in denying the Commission's request for\nenforcement.\nThe factual history in the Philadelphia case has been outlined in the majority opinion and I will not repeat it here. I\ndo believe, however, that certain aspects should be emphasized and clarified. The majority opinion focuses upon\nthe Commission's amended Final Order of September 25, 1972. This tends to obscure the fact that the order\nsought to be enforced by the Commission is for purposes of this case the same as the order it issued on June 7,\n1971. This order came under judicial scrutiny when the School District of Philadelphia (District) took an appeal to\nthe Commonwealth Court. That action resulted in an affirmance of the Commission's order as it relates to the\n[4]\nmatters presently before this Court.  In that decision the Commonwealth Court accepted the Commission's\nfindings that there was de facto segregation in the District's pupil population.\n441 *441 It is also significant that the Order of June 7, 1971 anticipated the completion of a desegregation plan by the\nbeginning of the 1974-75 school year. We have now completed the 1977-78 school year and a satisfactory plan\nhas yet to be designed or implemented. When we consider that the discussions relating to the racial imbalance\namong the students within the District began in 1968, it becomes apparent that a decade has passed without a\nresolution of this urgent problem. In this setting of procrastination and delay the majority contends that it is\nreasonable to accept an entirely voluntary plan for desegregation of the system. Further, it condones withholding\n[5]\nany mandatory measures until February 1, 1980.\nThe essence of the Commission's objection is its unwillingness in face of the history of this litigation to accept the\nplan without mandatory features. Specifically, the assurances sought are that the District's plan should have\nincluded guarantees that a control would be maintained over admissions to program elements to stimulate\ndesegregation; to guarantee an immediate realignment of school boundaries in contiguous attendance areas\nwhere racial imbalance exists; and a commitment by the District to a plan of involuntary desegregation should the\nproposed voluntary plan fail to accomplish the desired result. In view of the history of the case, the Commission's\nreluctance to consent to the plan offered was, in my judgment, a reasonable position.\n\nThe Commonwealth Court reasoned:\n\"In a `manner of speaking, it might be said that the School District of Philadelphia became\nsegregated by action of the people on a voluntary basis by their selection of their neighborhood of\nresidence. It does not seem inappropriate, therefore, to attempt to achieve desegregation by the\nequally voluntary action of the people in the selection of the schools their children will attend.'\"\n442 *442Pa. H.R.C. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 30 Pa.Cmwlth. 644, 647, 374 A.2d 1014, 1016 (1977).\nThis is the most blatant example of a court substituting its judgment for that of the agency charged with the\nresponsibility of dealing with the problems in areas of its expertise. It also illustrates the danger of allowing courts\nto dabble in areas beyond their competence. The fallacy of this reasoning is so obvious that it should not require\na response, however, since my brethren seem to be impressed, I am compelled to do so.\nUnquestionably the segregated pattern in the school population is in large measure reflective of a segregated\nresidential pattern. It is, however, erroneous to assume that the selection of residence in America today is the\n\"voluntary\" choice of all of the citizens of this society. One of the recognized evils of racial prejudice is that it\nforces those subjected to its insidious poison to accept housing which is substandard and located in the least\ndesirable sections. Discrimination deprives minorities of the freedom of choice in the selection of their residence\nthat most members of majority classes possess.\n\"There are many social and economic causes for the rigidified residential patterns which dominate\nour communities, and despite anti-discrimination laws the barriers to integrated housing are often\ndifficult to breach. Indeed the way to attack discrimination in housing and employment may be to\nbegin with a program of quality integrated education. The best way to demonstrate the `inherent\nworth of [one's] neighbor' is to place individuals in a situation where they are exposed to their\nneighbor. This is especially true if a child can become aware of his neighbors' capabilities before\nhis prejudices have had a chance to develop, but inter-racial cooperation may also have a\nbeneficial effect on the thinking of adults. Thus, participation in such school activities as the P.T.A.\nmay promote a better understanding which is the crucial first step toward the achievement of a\ntruly integrated society. To paraphrase Mr. Justice HOLMES, one such experience may be worth\n443 several volumes of sociology.\" (footnote *443 omitted) Pa. H.R.C. v. Chester Sch. Dist., supra, 427\nPa. at 170-71, 233 A.2d at 297.\nTo me it is more reasonable to adopt the Commission's view that since the racial imbalance in our school\npopulation is, in large measure, created by involuntary residential patterns forced upon the minority members of\nthe community, it is not inappropriate to impose involuntary measures upon the school district majority to alleviate\nthese conditions. In making this statement, I am particularly aware that one of the dominant concerns of those\nseeking restrictive and exclusive residential patterns is the racial complexion of the school their children will be\nattending. To remove the exclusivity of the school population would, in my judgment, assist in large measure in\n[6]\novercoming the present resistance to change in the residential patterns.\n444 *444 Therefore, I am of the view that it cannot be said that there was not a reasonable basis for the\nCommission's disapproval of the plan submitted by the Philadelphia School District. Under the substantial\nevidence test the Commission's position should have been sustained and the plan presently before the Court\nrejected.\nII. JURISDICTION\nI also take exception to the majority's disposition of the jurisdictional question in this case (majority op. at\n1244-1245). The parties did not press the jurisdictional issue before this Court, and there is no dispute that this\nCourt has general subject matter jurisdiction over the instant case. The underlying question involves the root of\nthat jurisdiction, i.e., whether this Court's review should be jurisdictionally based upon section 203 of the\nAppellate Court Jurisdiction Act, 17 P.S. § 211.203 (Supp. 1978-79), or upon the discretionary jurisdiction\n\nauthorized by section 204(a), id. § 211.204(a). In my view, it is unwise for the majority to resolve such an\n[7]\nimportant question without the benefit of thorough briefs and arguments by the litigants.\nIII. THE MANDATE IN THE PITTSBURGH CASE\n445 My final point of contention concerns the majority's mandate in the Pittsburgh case. Preliminarily I note that I still \n*445 adhere to this Court's holding in Pa. H.R.C. v. Norristown Area School Dist., 473 Pa. 334, 374 A.2d 671\n(1977), that the Commission's Recommended Elements are not inflexible administrative regulations but rather\nare advisory guidelines. In keeping with this holding, the majority today remands the Pittsburgh case to the\nCommonwealth Court with instructions to modify its order in a manner consistent with the majority opinion. The\n[8]\nmajority then goes into considerable detail as to the nature and extent of the mandated modification.  I am of\nthe opinion that such a mandate is totally unnecessary, is wasteful of judicial resources, and creates the\npossibility of further appellate review and the delay attendant thereto.\nThis Court has thoroughly considered the allegations and arguments of all parties to this appeal and is therefore\nin an excellent position to modify the order itself in precisely the manner in which it directs the Commonwealth\nCourt to act. See note 8, supra. There can be no doubt that this Court is empowered to modify lower court orders,\nand considering the interests of judicial economy and avoidance of delay in a matter of grave significance to the\ncitizens of Pittsburgh, I can find no justification for placing another judicial hurdle in the path of final resolution of\nthis case. It is at least conceivable that the Pittsburgh Board of Education may be dissatisfied with the\nCommonwealth Court's modified order. In such an event, the Board may again elect to appeal to this Court on\nthe grounds that the court's modified order is inconsistent with today's majority opinion. If I understand the\n446 majority's jurisdictional discussion, this Court would *446 then be compelled to entertain such an appeal, because\nunder the majority view section 203 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, 17 P.S. § 211.203 (Supp. 1978-79),\ngoverns the instant case. This possibility of further appellate review could be avoided if this Court itself would\nsimply modify the Commonwealth Court's order.\nThe parties have had their day or days in court, and it is now time for them to move forward in the process of\nproviding a racially integrated school system for the children of Pittsburgh. The majority's mandate merely sows\nthe seeds for the future frustration of that process.\nROBERTS and MANDERINO, JJ., join in this dissent.\n[1] The Court's remand of these decisions was occasioned by the PHRC's original direction that the School\nDistricts recruit and assign an integrated staff at all levels for all schools, a requirement which the Court deemed\nto be without legal or evidentiary support. The Commission's Amended Final Orders deleted all provisions relating\nto staff integration and that issue is not presented in any way by these appeals.\n[2] Such an appeal was taken by the other three school district defendants. See Pennsylvania Human Relations\nCommission v. Uniontown Area School District, 455 Pa. 52, 313 A.2d 156 (1973).\n[3] Prof. Louis Jaffe, in his work, Judicial Control of Administrative Action (1965), made a searching inquiry into\nthe judicial role in the enforcement of agency orders. The following passages are particularly enlightening: \n\"Occasionally the Supreme Court has characterized the district courts and courts of appeal exercising powers of\njudicial review and enforcement as `courts of equity.' This has encouraged litigants to invoke the traditional broad\npowers of the chancellor to temper with mercy the harsh application of rules. The court will be asked to mitigate,\nremit, or suspend the sanction imposed by the administrative order or regulation. This appeal to the alleged\nequitable powers of the court ordinarily will fail; the court, if relief is granted, will seek to justify its action on the\nground that the agency's action is in excess of statutory warrant. It must be admitted that to characterize the\ncourt as a `court of equity' is not apt. The chancellor's jurisdiction is broad and original. But in our situation it is\nthe agency which has original jurisdiction in the sense of the power to choose from among valid competing\nsolutions. The reviewing court's basic role is to decide whether the chosen solution is valid.\"\n.....\n\n\"There is a considerable body of law concerning judicial control of administrative remedies, most of it 00 in the\n97\nfederal sphere 00 dealing with the Labor Board and the Trade Commission. Though characteristically the agencies\n97\nare allowed broad discretion in formulating remedies, the Supreme Court has developed principles of control.\nThus the question may be raised whether the order bears an `appropriate relation to the policies of the Act';\nwhether `the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the\npolicies of the Act', whether the Board has `patently traveled outside the orbit of its authority so that there is,\nlegally speaking, no order to enforce.' The concept most usually applied in testing the sanction imposed by the\norder is the distinction between what can be justified as appropriate to right the wrong and what cannot be so\njustified.\" Id. at 263, 267.\n[4] The record before this Court does not include the February 26, 1973 plan nor indicate what actions were\ncontemplated by that plan, nor does it provide any basis for determining what specific objections the Commission\nhad to it. The Commission never took formal action disapproving Pittsburgh's plan of February 1973 and the\nCommission's position with respect to that plan was of course not presented to any court for its review.\n[5] By way of New Matter in its Answer, the School District averred that pursuant to Act 150 of 1975, Act of\nDecember 19, 1975, P.L. ___, No. 150, a referendum had been held in the School District of Pittsburgh, the effect\nof which was to replace the fifteen member Board of Public Education, formerly appointed by the Court of\nCommon Pleas of Allegheny County, with a nine member Board of Public Education elected by the voters of the\nSchool District. The members of the Board thus elected assumed office on December 6, 1976.\n[6] Similarly, the School District did not contend that its original reorganization plan of February, 1973 was an\nappropriate response to the Commission's Amended Final Order or that there was adequate justification for any\naspects of that plan which were not in compliance with that Order. On this appeal, the School District has made\nreference to steps which it has taken to achieve increased integration in certain areas of the District, while the\nPHRC contends that other actions taken by the School District have actually increased the degree of\nsegregation. No evidence was presented to the Commonwealth Court by either party with respect to the actions\nof the School District during the period 1973 through 1976, and the record in this proceeding is absolutely barren\nwith respect to the current status of Pittsburgh's school population or the degree to which its school population is\neducated in racially identifiable facilities.\n[7] The District's petition for allowance of appeal was superfluous in this case. Section 204(b) of the Appellate\nCourt Jurisdiction Act, 17 P.S. § 211.204(b), provides that if an appeal is improvidently taken to this Court\npursuant to section 203 of that act, the appeal shall not be dismissed but shall be acted upon as a petition for\nallowance of appeal under section 204(a).\n[8] The order of the Commonwealth Court stated that the School District had represented to the court that it had a\ndesegregation committee which together with certain staff had been working to devise a desegregation plan; that\nthat plan would meet the requirements set forth in the Amended Final Order except as to timetable; and that such\nplan could be ready for submission to the Board of Education of the School District by 1973 year-end and to the\nPHRC by mid-February, 1974.\n[9] The record before this Court does not identify the components of the February 1974 plan submitted by\nPhiladelphia nor does it provide any basis for determining what specific objections the Commission had to the\nplan. The Commonwealth Court summarized the plan as \"proposing in immediate future the busing of students\nfrom seven predominantly black schools and one predominantly white school to six other schools, the possibility\nof other such operations in the future, and other measures, including the pairing of a `significant number of\nadjacent schools which have a potential for pairing.'\" See Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School\nDistrict of Philadelphia, 23 Pa.Cmwlth. 312, 319, 352 A.2d 200, 204 (1976).\n[10] The Kurtzman Report, while noting various factors which constituted obstacles to the preparation of an\nacceptable desegregation plan in the Philadelphia School District, criticized both the PHRC and the School\nDistrict for the lack of any movement toward some measure of desegregation. The Kurtzman Report envisioned a\nyear devoted to the development of quality educational programs, physical changes which would accommodate\ndesegregation, in-service training and staff planning, and community involvement; in subsequent years, the\n\nReport called for the creation of Educational Services Areas which would in the main embrace student\npopulations of an acceptable racial balance and for the reorganization of the District's schools on a basis of\ngrades (i.e., kindergarten to 4th grade, fifth to eighth grade, and ninth to twelfth grade). The Report\nrecommended no significant desegregation for schools in Educational Service Areas which embraced roughly\n25% of the school population. While recommending an outline for the desegregation efforts, the Report did not\nprovide a detailed description of the particular school assignments which would be required by the overall\ndesegregation concept advanced.\n[11] A petition to intervene in these proceedings was filed by Harry and Annemarie Gwynne and others; the\npetition avers that the intervenors were parents of children who were enrolled in the Philadelphia public schools\nand who would be affected by implementation of the Kurtzman Report. The Commonwealth Court granted that\npetition. The intervenors have participated in the public proceedings before the Commonwealth Court.\n[12] The Commission's plan was an attempt to maximize desegregation consistent with the constraint of limiting\ntransportation of any student to a bus trip which would not exceed 45 minutes a day, each way to and from\nschool. The Commission's plan utilized the District's existing School Planning Areas as the basic component of its\nreorganization and called for the mandatory assignment of students on a random basis to schools within such\nAreas to achieve desegregated schools. In view of the transportation constraint which the Commission accepted,\ncertain areas of the School District which accounted for roughly 15% of the school population would not be\naffected by the Commission's plan. The Commission estimated that implementation of the proposed plan would\nentail the reassignment of approximately 40,000 elementary school students and the transportation of roughly\n53,000 elementary and middle school students for distances in excess of 1½ miles. As noted by the\nCommonwealth Court, the Commission's plan would actually have increased the number of schools that had a\nblack student population in excess of 60%.\n[13] The District's \"plan\" is a five page document which states the District's view that compliance with the\nAmended Final Order is impossible as a practical matter; it proposes the creation of a Metropolitan School\nDistrict embracing Philadelphia and school districts in adjacent counties, provided that the Commonwealth\nprovides complete financing for the operations of that metropolitan district.\n[14] In summarizing the past history of the dealings between the Commission and the Philadelphia School District\nand the failure to obtain some progress toward desegregation, the court placed blame upon each party for its\nrigidity. In assessing the plans before it, the court concluded that the Commission's plan was \"without educational\ncontent or community contribution and, in our judgment, requires more to be done than its practical effect on the\n115 schools having 90 percent or more black students justifies.\" Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v.\nSchool District of Philadelphia, 23 Pa. Cmwlth. 312, 331, 352 A.2d 200, 211 (1976). It concluded that the School\nDistrict's plan was \"certainly beyond our power to compel and must be rejected.\"\n[15] On or about October 7, 1976 and after the Commission's disapproval of the submitted plan, the\nPennsylvania Department of Education submitted its review of the 1976 Plan to the District. The Department did\nnot question the educational content of the Plan when viewed apart from its desegregation intent, but it\nexpressed reservations that the 1976 Plan would achieve significant desegregation of the Philadelphia school\nsystem. \nOn November 10, 1976, the PHRC formally notified the School District of its objections to the 1976 Plan. Certain\nof those objections related to matters as to which the School District had previously indicated its agreement with\nthe Commission's position.\n[16] Although the Commission has not withdrawn its motion to quash in the Pittsburgh proceeding, it has advised\nthe Court that it does not wish to press or brief the issue of the appealability of the order. The question of this\nCourt's jurisdiction is nonetheless properly before the Court as a threshold issue in both cases. E.g., Marshall v.\nPowers, 477 Pa. 306, 383 A.2d 946 (1978); McGee v. Singley, 382 Pa. 18, 22, 114 A.2d 141 (1955).\n[17] The pleadings in that court have framed the issue before us, and to the extent that the parties deemed it\nappropriate they have submitted to us testimony and evidence presented to the Commonwealth Court in support\nof their respective positions.\n\n[18] Appellant Pittsburgh also appears to contend that the change in the manner of selection of individual Board\nmembers from an appointive system to an elective system justifies the return of this matter to the initial point of\ndeparture and in some respect vitiates all prior proceedings. That argument is without merit. The prior Board, no\nless than the present Board, was the duly constituted authority for conducting the affairs of the School District;\nthe present Board, no less than its appointed predecessors, is subject to the applicable laws of the\nCommonwealth. \nAppellant also contends that the court erroneously assumed that the School District was amenable to disposition\nof this matter by an order requiring the submission of a plan. Nothing of record contradicts the court's statement\nthat counsel who represented the School District before the Commonwealth Court made such a representation to\nthe court. Moreover, in view of the court's power to enter the order in question on the basis of the present record\nand the absence of any material controverted facts, we do not deem it appropriate to remand the matter to the\nCommonwealth Court for reconsideration of the School District's position as requested by its present counsel.\n[19] Similar challenges were pressed further by the other school districts involved in that case and were rejected\nby this Court on appeal. See Uniontown Area School District v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 455\nPa. 52, 313 A.2d 156 (1973).\n[20]See appellant Pittsburgh's brief at 13-15 and 17-18.\n[21] As indicated in the mandate, infra at 1254, Mr. Justice NIX, Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice\nMANDERINO would not remand, but would have this Court enter such modified order as it deems appropriate.\n[22] The record indicates that approximately 35,000 students are now enrolled in schools which meet the PHRC\nRecommended Elements.\n[23] The identified factors which the School District accepted in principle were the following: development of a\ndefinition of desegregated schools; development of a timetable for implementation, including the number of\nstudents and/or schools which would be desegregated in particular years and the program elements which would\nbe implemented in particular years; the use of site selection for program elements to foster desegregation; the\nuse of school closings and construction to foster desegregation; the development of a system for monitoring, and\nfor reporting to the PHRC and the Philadelphia Department of Education, the desegregation and educational\neffects of the program elements included in the Plan; and the designation of administrative responsibility for the\nimplementation and supervision of the Plan. \nThe District's response also noted that, although community involvement was not one of the factors identified by\nthe PHRC in its written response, such involvement had been raised as a necessary factor in meetings between\nDistrict and Commission representatives; the District advised the Commission that it believed such involvement\nwas essential to the implementation of the Plan.\n[24] One of the factors identified by the Commission was the involuntary reassignment, by the beginning of the\nschool year 1977-78, of students \"attending segregated schools in contiguous school attendance areas by\nredrawing attendance boundary lines, pairing, or any other method selected by the district.\" The District advised\nthe PHRC that it intended to vote on the involuntary desegregation of contiguous schools at its October 1976\nmeeting and that it was considering in this connection the pairing of four sets of two schools apiece.\n[25] By an evenly divided vote the Board of Education had declined to endorse the Commission's\nrecommendation that the District commit itself to the involuntary reassignment of pupils to accomplish\ndesegregation in the event that the District's desegregation goals were not met by voluntary means. \nThe Board accepted the PHRC's recommendation that it adopt racial admission controls that would give\npreference in admissions to program elements to students attending an already segregated school in which their\nrace is in the majority, but it declined to accept the PHRC's recommendation of racial admissions controls\nwhereby students would be selected for each program element and site to ensure a non-segregated racial mix of\nparticipants.\n[26] The Commission's letter states the basis for its disapproval as follows: \n\n\"The Board's failure . . . to commit itself to desegregate the District by involuntary means should the voluntary\nprograms fail, to provide assurances that a control would be maintained over admission to program elements to\nguarantee their desegregation, and to guarantee that students who attend schools in contiguous attendance\nareas would be reassigned to accomplish desegregation, made the Plan unacceptable. Moreover, your refusal to\naccept these principles renders any further discussion on specifics meaningless.\"\nWith respect to racial controls, the Commission's specification of objections stated that such controls might be\nestablished \"by giving students attending an already segregated school in which their race is in the majority a\npreference in admission to program elements, and by other means.\" As noted above, the District had committed\nitself in principle to the concept of preferential admissions standards and at the hearing before the\nCommonwealth Court counsel for the School District stated that the District agreed that racial admissions\ncontrols and the monitoring of admissions to program elements would be necessary.\nIn view of that commitment and the Commission's failure to identify any other technique of racial admission\ncontrols, the extent of the actual disagreement between the School District and the Commission on this point is\nnot clear. Thus, the issues of an involuntary assignment contingency plan and the involuntary reassignment of\nstudents in contiguous districts appear to be the central issues in the dispute between the PHRC and the\nPhiladelphia School District.\n[27] Dr. Foster was employed at the Florida School Desegregation Center at the University of Miami (Fla.). He\nwas the principal author of the July 7, 1975 desegregation plan which was submitted by the PHRC to the\nCommonwealth Court. As noted supra, pp. 1242-1243, the Commonwealth Court in its order of February 13,\n1976 declined to direct the implementation of that plan.\n[28] Several of these proposed pairings involved the merger of identifiably black schools with schools having a\npopulation of predominantly Spanish surnamed students. The pairings of such schools would have resulted in\nsmall white student populations and would have failed to satisfy the Commission's Recommended Elements or\nthe Commission's alternative endorsement of schools having at least 20% white, 20% black and 20% Spanish\nsurnamed students. See infra, note 31.\n[29] The four categories are described above at p. 1249.\n[30] On this latter point, Dr. Foster's position is somewhat inconsistent with that of the PHRC. Dr. Foster testified\nthat absent unusual circumstances, \"you would leave a desegregated school alone and not change the student\nbody.\" The Commission's letter of November 10, 1976 stating the basis for its disapproval of the 1976 Plan states\nthat the exemption from the Plan of schools which already met its guidelines could not be accepted without an\nagreement by the District to adopt the PHRC's guidelines for the entire Plan.\n[31] The Commission's Recommended Elements do not speak to the issue of ethnic isolation and its\ncomplexities; by their own terms, they deal only with the problem of undue racial concentrations and the\npercentage of black students in a particular school population. It is not clear what standards, if any, the\nCommission believes appropriate to situations of \"ethnic\" as distinguished from \"racial\" isolation. \nDr. Foster noted that the Commission's 1976 Plan, which he had prepared, would have deemed a school\nacceptable if its student body was at least 20% black, 20% Spanish surnamed, and 20% \"other\", and he stated\nhis belief that the Commission would accept such a position. Use of that standard would mean that a school with\na population that was 60% white and 40% black would be considered \"racially\" imbalanced, while a school\npopulation that was 20% white, 60% black, and 20% Spanish surnamed would be considered \"racially\" balanced.\nApplication of Dr. Foster's standard to the twenty-three schools which had a Spanish surnamed population in\nexcess of 20% would mean that none of the eight schools which meet the Commission's Recommended\nElements had student bodies which Dr. Foster deemed acceptable, while five other schools which did not satisfy\nthe Recommended Elements had a student mix which satisfied Dr. Foster's standard.\n[32] Both Dr. Foster in his testimony before the Commonwealth Court and the Commonwealth's Department of\nEducation endorse the Plan's elements from an educational point of view.\n\n[1] This Court stated recently: \n\"From the outset, we note that the Legislature, in an attempt to deal comprehensively with the basic and\nfundamental problem of discrimination, clothed the Human Relations Commission with authority to `. . . take such\naffirmative action including but not limited to . . . [several specific courses of action] as, in the judgment of the\nCommission, will effectuate the purposes of this act, and including a requirement for report of the manner of\ncompliance.' Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, supra at § 9, 43 P.S. § 959 (Supp. 1973) (emphasis added).\nThe words `as in the judgment of the Commission' indicate to us that the Legislature recognized that only an\nadministrative agency with broad remedial powers, exercising particular expertise, could cope effectively with the\npervasive problem of unlawful discrimination. Accordingly, the Legislature vested in the Commission, quite\nproperly, maximum flexibility to remedy and hopefully eradicate the `evils' of discrimination. Pennsylvania Human\nRelations Act, supra at § 2(a), 43 P.S. § 952(a) (Supp. 1973). The legislative mandate that the provisions of the\nAct be `construed liberally', noted supra, serves to reinforce this view.\nWe thus recognize that the expertise of the Commission in fashioning remedies is not to be lightly regarded.\"\nPa.

Alto-Reste Park Cemetery Ass'n,\n453 Pa. 124, 133-34, 306 A.2d 881, 887 (1973).\n[3] Prof. Louis Jaffe, in his work, Judicial Control of Administrative Action (1965), made a searching inquiry into\nthe judicial role in the enforcement of agency orders. The following passages are particularly enlightening: \n\"Occasionally the Supreme Court has characterized the district courts and courts of appeal exercising powers of\njudicial review and enforcement as `courts of equity.' This has encouraged litigants to invoke the traditional broad\npowers of the chancellor to temper with mercy the harsh application of rules. The court will be asked to mitigate,\nremit, or suspend the sanction imposed by the administrative order or regulation. This appeal to the alleged\nequitable powers of the court ordinarily will fail; the court, if relief is granted, will seek to justify its action on the\nground that the agency's action is in excess of statutory warrant. It must be admitted that to characterize the\ncourt as a `court of equity' is not apt. The chancellor's jurisdiction is broad and original. But in our situation it is\n\nthe agency which has original jurisdiction in the sense of the power to choose from among valid competing\nsolutions. The reviewing court's basic role is to decide whether the chosen solution is valid.\"\n.....\n\"There is a considerable body of law concerning judicial control of administrative remedies, most of it 00 in the\n97\nfederal sphere 00 dealing with the Labor Board and the Trade Commission. Though characteristically the agencies\n97\nare allowed broad discretion in formulating remedies, the Supreme Court has developed principles of control.\nThus the question may be raised whether the order bears an `appropriate relation to the policies of the Act';\nwhether `the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the\npolicies of the Act', whether the Board has `patently traveled outside the orbit of its authority so that there is,\nlegally speaking, no order to enforce.' The concept most usually applied in testing the sanction imposed by the\norder is the distinction between what can be justified as appropriate to right the wrong and what cannot be so\njustified.\" Id. at 263, 267.\n[4] The Commonwealth Court did remand the cause to the Commission. This action was necessitated by\nprovisions in that order relating to requirements that the District adopt affirmative recruitment programs to correct\nde facto racial imbalance in the professional and non-professional staffs. The Amendment of the June 7, 1971\norder to bring it into compliance with the Commonwealth Court's directive was accomplished by deleting all\nprovisions relating to staff integration. Sch. Dist. of Phila. v. Pa. Human Relations Com., 6 Pa. Cmwlth.Ct. 281,\n294 A.2d 410 (1972).\n[5] The sincerity of the District is best gleaned from the plan offered by it in response to the Commonwealth\nCourt's order of October 1, 1974. This plan called for the creation of a Metropolitan School District embracing\nPhiladelphia and school districts in adjacent counties. The political obstacles in such a proposal should have\nbeen apparent to even the most naive.\n[6] I am not unmindful of those who place the neighborhood school system on a preferred pedestal. My response\nto them is the statement of Mr. Justice ROBERTS in Pa. H.R.C. v. Chester Sch. Dist., supra: \n\"The argument that the Commission's order will destroy the neighborhood school system completely distorts the\nhistorical rationale of neighborhood schools. Traditionally, the neighborhood school has been an exercise in\ndemocracy, `a single structure serving a heterogeneous community in which children of varied racial, cultural,\nreligious, and socio-economic backgrounds were taught together 00 the proverbial melting pot.' One educator has\n97\nrecalled: `Most men and women over 40 recall a childhood schooling in which the sons and daughters of\nmillowners, shop proprietors, professional men, and day laborers attended side by side. School boundaries,\nreaching out into fields and hills to embrace the pupil population, transcended such socio-economic clusterings\nas existed.'\nHowever, increasing population density in our nation's urban areas have caused neighborhoods to shrink\ndrastically until today convenience is the most common justification for school attendance zones. Thus, `because\nof rigid racial and socio-economic stratification, ethnic and class similarity has become the most salient present-\nday neighborhood characteristic, particularly in urban areas. The neighborhood school, which encompasses a\nhomogeneous racial and socio-economic grouping, as is true today, is the very antithesis of the common school\nheritage.' Rather than neighborhood schools, we have all too frequently developed a system of ghetto schools.\nIntegration need not see the demise of neighborhood schooling, although unquestionably new patterns of\ndistricting will have to occur.\"\nId. 427 Pa. at 174-75, 233 A.2d at 299, quoting Carter, De Facto School Segregation: An Examination of the\nLegal and Constitutional Questions Presented, 16 West-Res.L.Rev. 502, 507 (1964); Racial Isolation in the\nPublic Schools, 40 (U.S. Comm. on Civil Rights, 1967). (footnote omitted).\nToday, heterogeneity is not the economic and social difference, but rather the ethnic, religious and racial\ndifferences that exist in our present community. The true neighborhood concept is one reflective of our present\npopulation where each student has the benefit of the association of those with whom he must compete in the life\nwhich he is preparing to enter.\n\n[7] The majority reaches its result on the jurisdiction question relying on the implicit premise that the enforcement\nproceeding under section 10 is an independent, separate and distinct proceeding. If, however, you view the entire\nproceeding as commencing with the administrative action below (conciliation, conference, complaint, hearing and\norder) the appeal of that order and the subsequent enforcement, the majority reasoning appears erroneous.\n[8] The majority states: \nThat order should make clear the District's obligation to prepare and submit a plan which addresses the problem\nof school desegregation in good faith and in realistic fashion. The District's Plan should take into account the\nRecommended Elements and the significance they will have for the deliberations of the Commission in its review\nof the plan. The order should, however, provide some degree of flexibility in recognition of the fact that a plan\nwhich fails to satisfy some aspect of the Recommended Elements may prove acceptable if the District\ndemonstrates that substantial and persuasive justification exists for any such departure.\nMajority op. at 00.\n97\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Commonwealth Ct. 542 (1994)\n651 A.2d 186\nPENNSYLVANIA HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION, Petitioner,\nv.\nSCHOOL DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA, Respondent, and Harry and Annemarie Gwynne,\nASPIRA of Pennsylvania, et al., Intervenors.\nCommonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.\nDecided November 28, 1994.\nMichael Hardiman, Asst. Chief Counsel, for petitioner.\nWilliam H. Brown, III, for respondent.\nMichael Churchill and Patricia A. Lowe, for intervenors.\n543 *543 SMITH, Judge.\nHearings were held on the educational plan filed on September 15, 1994 by the Court-appointed Educational\nTeam which recommended ways to remedy the racial disparities in educational opportunity and academic\nachievement and to enhance voluntary desegregation in the Philadelphia public schools. The educational plan\nwas developed by a seven-member group of educational experts pursuant to the Court's opinion and order filed\nin Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 161 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 658,\n638 A.2d 304 (1994). The Educational Team conducted research, compiled and analyzed School District data,\nengaged in public factfinding, and after several months of activity, designed a plan for review and consideration\nby the Court.\nA.\nThe Court heard testimony from the Educational Team Chairperson who served as facilitator in the preparation of\nthe educational plan and presented an overview of the Educational Team's work, and testimony from various\nwitnesses for the parties to support their respective responses to the educational plan. The Court was persuaded\nby the testimony of Dr. Susan Virginia Bredekamp, an expert in early childhood development called by ASPIRA.\nDr. Bredekamp reiterated testimony offered throughout these proceedings that all children are capable of learning\nat high levels, given the opportunity to do so, and research has shown that smaller class size produces significant\nachievement gains for minority students.\nSuperintendent of Schools, Mr. David Hornbeck, presented persuasive and cogent arguments to support his\nproposal to reform the educational process within the School District of Philadelphia and explained how he\nintends to go about this process through a 10-point \"Children Achieving\" agenda. He stated that high academic\nstandards must be the benchmark for reform and, as the Court agrees, Philadelphia may very well become a\n544 national model in improving the academic *544 achievement of students in a large urban area. The\nSuperintendent believes that his 10-point agenda must be implemented in its entirety if Philadelphia public school\nstudents are to achieve at high levels. The agenda, however, has not been implemented in any other school\ndistrict.\nDr. Margaret Doss Willis, Director of the Southwest Center for Educational Equity funded by the U.S. Department\nof Education, testified as the School District's expert in the area of urban education and education equity as it\nrelates to the achievement of minority and poor children. She testified that urban school districts tend to work in a\nvacuum rather than calling upon available outside assistance and that to reduce racial disparities in academic\nachievement, any reform effort should include challenging instruction for minority students, parental involvement\n\nin the schools, and smaller class size. Dr. Willis stated that she has collected no data which demonstrates that\nacademic achievement of students improved as a result of school-based governance.\n[1]\nVarious educational reports and studies  suggest that decentralization and the corresponding transfer of school\ngovernance to school-based management produce little or no discernible positive effects on student\nachievement. School-based management traditionally has organizational structure and school empowerment as\nits center; however, despite the absence of data conclusively showing improvement in academic achievement,\nstudies document the increased autonomy of parents, teachers and principals which enhance school\nenvironment.\nThe Court has examined in part recent education legislation signed into law by the President signaling a strong\nmessage for reinvesting in public school education where the focus is on high academic achievement of all\n545 students. The Improving America's Schools Act of October 20, 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-382, *545 promotes high\nquality educational opportunity for all children and authorizes, inter alia, additional federal funds to approved\nschool districts which develop creative new magnet programs or substantially revised magnet programs for\nstudents at all academic levels. The magnet assistance program dispels the notion that magnet programs \"skim\noff\" only the highest achieving students and supports the selection of students by processes other than academic\ntesting. The Act specifically recognizes the dual purpose of magnet programs as an effective means for improving\n[2]\nacademic achievement and for the desegregation of students of all racial backgrounds.\nB.\nThe Court has thoroughly reviewed testimony offered by the parties as well as the educational plan and written\npublic responses to the plan. Those responses represented, among others, the views of parents, teachers,\nbusiness leaders, community and civic workers, one member of City Council, the Philadelphia Federation of\nTeachers (PFT), and various other unions which support the PFT's position. Further, the Court has also studied\nreports of decentralization and restructuring efforts in Chicago, New York, and Kentucky which have instituted\neducational measures containing features incorporated throughout the educational plan. Finally, the Court\nconducted site visits to elementary, middle and high schools within the regions in an effort to glean greater insight\ninto the gravity of the issues before the Court.\n546 *546 While educational experts have provided invaluable assistance throughout these proceedings, the views\nexpressed by students, parents, teachers and principals and written public comment are just as valuable and\ncompelling in fashioning an appropriate order in this case. Without a willingness on their part to assume\nresponsibility and obligations to make educational reform a success, all else pales in significance. Likewise, no\namount of reform strategies or additional financial resources can effectively alter the status quo unless those\npersons central to the reform effort are committed to making it work.\nMoreover, the results of a thirty-year study by the U.S. Department of Education and other reports reinforce the\nresponse of many that the initial and immediate focus in school reform should be on school safety and student\n[3]\ndiscipline, parental involvement, and teaching students strong basic educational skills if they are to succeed.\nThus incorporated into the following order is the Court's decision to remain committed to educational reform\nstrategies that have been proven successful in the past and shown to produce permanent and lasting effects on\nstudent achievement and progress. Proven educational strategies have been too long denied Black and Hispanic\n[4]\nstudents in racially isolated schools.\n547 *547 After weighing the evidence and information presented throughout these proceedings, the Court enters the\nfollowing order pursuant to its February 4, 1994 opinion and order compelling the School District to provide equal\neducational opportunity and educational quality to all students and to expand the voluntary desegregation of the\nschools. The Court's order shall incorporate the student, parent, teacher and principal as central participants in\nthe educational reform effort, high academic standards and elimination of racial disparities in academic\nachievement as the primary missions, and rigorous curriculum framework as its core.\n\nThe order shall set forth specific requirements to be met by the School District while simultaneously affording\nlatitude and flexibility to the District to devise an effective plan for submission to the Court. To the extent modified\nor otherwise indicated, the Court adopts the educational plan recommendations for Teaching and Learning/\nProfessional Development; Desegregation and Educational Improvement; Resources, in part; School Climate,\nSafety and Discipline; Organizational Restructuring, Accountability and Facilities, in part; and Monitoring. The\nspecifics contained in the recommendations accepted by the Court may serve as a blueprint for the School\nDistrict's plan to be submitted to the Court.\nIT IS NOW THEREFORE ORDERED that the School District shall develop and submit to the Court no later than\nFebruary 15, 1995 a plan that addresses the following components and provides timetables for implementation:\nParental Involvement\n1. The School District shall immediately develop creative outreach strategies for each school to implement, where\n548 necessary, *548 to convince parents of school students of the critical need for their direct participation in the\neducation of their children. The School District shall direct these strategies initially toward racially isolated schools\nwhere students' parents shall be encouraged to become regular partners with their childrens' teachers, to serve\nas parent classroom representatives, to develop ways to help their children to meet high academic standards,\nand to serve as classroom and school volunteers. These parents may serve as a core for the local school\ncouncils referred to below under organizational restructuring.\nTeaching and Learning/Professional Development\n2. The School District shall develop:\na. Clear educational standards for curricula based on national exemplary standards defining what\nstudents should learn and what teachers should teach to improve academic achievement of\nstudents. Curricula standards shall be developed with priority emphasis on teaching strong\nfoundations in English, writing and math skills in addition to other core academic subjects;\nb. Content and performance standards for student achievement which shall characterize the\nknowledge and competency required for successful transition to higher education or job training\nand employment; intermediate achievement expectations at specific points in elementary and\nsecondary schools; specific academic achievement goals for students in racially isolated schools;\nand\nc. Development of a process for assessing whether students have met culminating and\nintermediate achievement standards and the disparities between current and best practices and\nbetween existing and desired student learning outcomes.\n3. The School District shall provide an effective program of professional development which responds to the new\nperformance standards and curricula framework and the Districtwide assessment of professional development\nneeds, and the School District shall include plans for the deployment of staff for training purposes and for utilizing\n549 the expertise of teachers *549 and principals employed within the School District. The program shall be designed,\ninter alia, to change teacher attitudes toward and expectations of students in racially isolated schools,\ndemonstrate that these students can learn at high levels if given the rigorous training and opportunity to do so,\nand to develop skills in encouraging parental involvement in the schools.\n4. The School District and PFT shall join together in urging institutions of higher education within the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania to provide mandatory courses for education majors in teaching multi-racial\nclassrooms in urban school districts and methods to promote parental involvement in the schools.\n5. The School District shall develop the necessary plans to provide full-day kindergarten by September 1995 to\nall at risk children eligible to attend the racially isolated schools and shall provide by September 1996 an\n\nopportunity for all eligible children throughout the District to attend a developmentally appropriate full-day\nkindergarten class.\n6. The School District shall develop a plan to reduce the average class size for kindergarten through third grade\nto one teacher and one aide for twenty students beginning with the racially isolated schools, and shall reduce\naverage class size from the current class size ratios for the remaining grades four through twelve. The School\nDistrict shall not prevent individual schools from altering the class size goals based upon appropriate and\nnecessary deployment of instructional resources and needs of the students for individual attention and training.\nThe School District shall provide, to the extent feasible, classroom aides through a collaborative effort with\ncolleges and universities and classroom assistants funded by federal and/or state agencies.\n7. The School District shall develop plans to enlist public agencies, colleges and universities, private institutions\nand community organizations in a collaborative effort with the School District to create developmentally\n550 appropriate preschool programs including Head Start and parent cooperative *550 programs to accommodate all\neligible children, focusing initially on racially isolated schools.\n8. The School District shall also request city, state and federal agencies to assist in the development of\ncommunity schools giving priority to racially isolated schools for afterschool and weekend tutorial programs;\nsummer school remedial, course credit or enrichment programs; health care services; drug and alcohol and other\nprevention programs; literacy classes; adult education classes; recreation and other programs aimed at\npromoting the development and academic achievement of students.\n9. The School District shall evaluate its bilingual education program for Hispanic students and develop a plan for\nreducing academic disparities and improving achievement.\n10. The School District shall determine whether its special education programs are in compliance with all\napplicable laws and whether the criteria for placement and the racial enrollment in these programs discriminate\nagainst Black and Hispanic students. The School District shall formulate plans which will ensure that special\neducation students receive proper educational training, regular evaluation to determine their eligibility for\nmainstreaming, professional training for special education teachers and staff.\nEducational Improvement\n11. The School District shall develop effective strategies for coordinating work and higher education readiness\nstandards which reflect how the School District proposes to collaborate with area colleges and universities,\nbusinesses, trade and municipal unions, and community-based organizations to implement school-to-work and\nschool-to-higher-education programs. The plan shall detail how the School District will expand its career\nacademies and magnet programs and themes to promote the programs, and how the School District will afford\nschool-to-work and school-to-higher-education opportunities to Black and Hispanic students.\n551 *551 12. After establishing clear academic standards and curriculum framework, the School District shall require\neach school to conduct a self-study which, in accordance with the new standards and curriculum framework, shall\naddress each school's instructional programs; student achievement levels; need for remedial reading and math\ninstruction; professional training needs; student promotion and assignment policies; parent and community\ninvolvement; school climate and safety; facilities needs; and any other appropriate components.\n13. To eliminate educationally disruptive weeks and/or months at the beginning of each school year, the School\nDistrict must provide proper school allotments which reduce the requirement for class leveling at the beginning of\neach school year. Student scheduling and teacher assignments shall be processed and completed in each school\nyear no later than the first full week of school beginning September 1995, and every school shall have at the\nbeginning of each school year text books and materials, computers and other equipment necessary for teachers\nto effectively teach their classes and for students to properly learn and to perform at grade level.\n14. The School District shall eliminate the practice of assigning non-certified substitute teachers to classes in\nracially isolated schools; offer incentives and take whatever steps are available to develop a core of experienced\nretired teachers willing to serve as substitutes in racially isolated schools; avoid the practice of assigning multiple\n\nsubstitutes to classrooms in racially isolated schools; and design ways to attract and to assign a greater\npercentage of experienced and qualified teachers to serve in racially isolated schools.\nDesegregation Strategies\n15. The School District shall expand its desegregation efforts by evaluating existing magnet and other academic\nenrichment programs and current voluntary desegregation levels and revising where appropriate to cause on an\nequitable basis a greater percentage of Black and Hispanic students afforded magnet and academic enrichment\nopportunities; by maintaining the existing magnet programs and schools and other voluntary desegregation\n552 efforts and designing new and *552 creative magnet programs and schools to attract students of all racial\nbackgrounds; and implementing new magnet, exemplary and academic enrichment learning programs and\npractices in racially isolated schools to provide students with more rigorous and academically challenging course\nwork necessary to excel.\n16. The School District shall abolish its desegregation office and establish an Equity Assurance Office, referred to\nbelow under organizational restructuring, which shall provide information to parents and students about\ndesegregation opportunities within the School District, develop steps which simplify procedures and expand\nvoluntary transfers for desegregation purposes, and ensure equity in the provision of educational opportunities to\nall students.\n17. The School District shall develop all other feasible methods for further voluntary desegregation of students\nthrough changes in school feeder patterns; design of school clusters, if any, which incorporate desegregation\nstrategies and prevent further segregation of students in poor and racially isolated areas; construction of new\nschool facilities and renovation of existing property centrally located and accessible to students of all racial\nbackgrounds; and development of a plan to address how children in racially isolated schools will be involved in\nculturally diverse educational and social experiences and how the District shall continue to address the promises\ncontained in the 1983 Memorandum of Understanding pertaining to the voluntary desegregation of schools.\nResources\n18. The School District shall apply for all local, state, federal and private grants for which the School District may\nbe eligible and shall develop a plan to assist individual schools in identifying and applying for available grants to\ntheir schools. The School District shall submit in its plan a list of all grants applied for or to be applied for in\n1994-1995 and in 1995-1996 and shall maintain a grants office to continuously pursue all available federal and\n553 state program funds. The School District shall also seek technical assistance from the *553 U.S. Department of\nEducation, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and other federal and state agencies in matters\nrelated to the reform effort, including parental and family involvement, eradicating student violence and\nvandalism, and professional development.\n19. The School District shall secure an independent performance and financial audit of its operations and\nexpenditures and shall cause School District personnel to cooperate with that study. The audit is to determine\neconomies and the amount of funds available to finance the instructional and other improvements necessary to\nend racial achievement disparities within the School District and to improve the quality of education available to\nall students.\n20. The School District shall submit a letter report to the Court by December 9, 1994 indicating the audit\ncompletion date, the identity and expertise of those conducting the audit, focus and scope of the audit, whether\nthe audit will include a full review of the allocation of resources, whether it will determine reductions in central and\nregional administrative staff positions, follow-up on prior audit findings and recommendations, review of school\nboard member expenditures and all other major functions and expense categories including facilities under-\nutilization, energy costs and vehicular use, and a review of other cost savings and increased revenue. The Court\nretains the option to order an independent audit by an outside accounting firm experienced in urban school audits\nwith all audit fees to be payable by the District.\n\n21. The educational plan recommendations 12 and 15 under the heading \"Resources\" are conditioned upon the\nresults of a performance and financial audit of the School District and the preparation of realistic and reasonable\ncost projections for implementation of the plan. The Court rejects the recommendation or any plan to shift school\nbudget funds to local councils to bank and to pay vendors and contractors directly. The release of potentially\nmillions of school budget dollars to local school councils raises indeterminable financial and auditing control\nquestions and more specifically, has not been shown to positively impact upon student academic achievement.\n554 School Climate, Safety and Discipline\n*554\n22. The School District must provide a school climate in which teachers can effectively teach and students can\nproperly learn. The School District shall identify the range of programs and resources which individual schools\nmay utilize to eliminate violence, vandalism and graffiti, and classroom disruption and shall set forth a course of\naction to remove persistently or habitually disruptive and violent students from the schools.\n23. The School District shall collaborate with social service agencies, parent volunteers, juvenile justice\nauthorities, and law enforcement agencies to eliminate school violence and disruption and shall request Juvenile\nCourt to assign probation officers to individual schools where needed to monitor students under the court's\njurisdiction. The School District must involve students' parents in eliminating school violence and disruption,\ninitiate exemplary programs such as Project Parent Involvement, and enlist parents and people in the community\nto also provide safe corridors in and around the schools.\n24. The School District shall develop and maintain a system-wide code of student conduct to be enforced by the\nschools promptly and in a nondiscriminatory manner. The conduct code shall include provisions for in-house\nsuspension or accommodation rooms for students requiring temporary removal from the classroom for\ndisciplinary purposes; clearly define for immediate implementation student conflict resolution and peer mediation\nprograms, with special emphasis on middle and high schools; and a plan to enlist civic, community, and other\ngroups to develop a voluntary student mentor program.\n25. The School District shall create alternative schools in each region for students who require extensive\ncounselling and/or supportive services not available at the schools. Alternative schools shall not be viewed as\nsubstitute placement for students whose disruptive behavior can be resolved through in-house suspension or\n555 accommodation, and placements to *555 alternative schools will not be utilized to discriminate against any\nparticular class or race of students.\n26. The School District shall determine the schools which experience the highest rates of absenteeism, truancy\nand dropout during the current, and past, school year and shall assign sufficient home and school visitors to\ncombat the alarming rates of absenteeism, truancy and dropout within the School District.\n27. The School District shall institute a system-wide voluntary dress code for adoption by elementary, middle and\nhigh schools to promote an orderly and disciplined school environment. The policy shall be consistent with\nlimitations imposed by the State Board of Education and may become mandatory where student attire causes\ndisruption of the educational process or health or safety concerns.\nOrganizational Restructuring\n28. The School District shall restructure its organizational operations in order to improve the academic\nachievement of students and to meet the new curricula standards; to foster decision making at the school level by\nteachers, principals and parents; and to streamline and reorganize the administrative and operational functions to\nprovide efficient and effective support to the individual schools. This shall be facilitated in part by the\nestablishment of one Local School Council, or other appropriate designation, for each school comprised of the\nprincipal, teachers, school staff, parents and community members who will participate in standard-setting and\ncurriculum development processes consonant with the School District's curriculum framework. A City-Wide\nCouncil Assembly may be established and made up of representatives from each local council, and the council\n\nassembly may elect an Executive Committee to consult with the Superintendent and Board of Education on\nmatters affecting student achievement and school governance.\n29. The School District shall abolish its desegregation office and institute an Equity Assurance Office whose\n556 primary responsibility shall be to monitor District efforts to *556 secure equity for all students and staff, monitor\nand expand voluntary desegregation efforts, and make recommendations to the school board and\nsuperintendent. As well, the District shall develop a Professional Development Center responsible for\nprofessional development of staff, development of a principal's training academy, and for training of parents and\nlocal school council members in school governance matters; and shall establish a Student Recruitment and\nEducational Counselling Office as a function of the Equity Assurance Office to ensure that students and their\nfamilies receive information about all available educational options. The School District shall engage the services\nof an independent organizational design consultant to assist in the restructuring process.\n30. A blueprint for the School District's design for school governance is contained in the June 1990 school-based\nmanagement memorandum between the School District and the PFT. The design shall not include the authority\nto hire or fire staff because this function is delegated to the School Board by virtue of the Public School Code of\n1949, Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as amended, 24 P.S. §§ 11-1127-1132, 21-2103, 2108 et seq. The design\nshall, however, provide a mechanism for local school councils to make personnel recommendations to the School\nDistrict, and to develop and adopt school budgets based upon school needs and allocations and to determine the\ndistribution of financial aid and personnel resources consistent with statutory school budgeting functions reposed\nin the Board of Education. The design for local school governance shall not include the transfer of school budget\nfunds to the local school councils on a pilot basis or otherwise, as indicated in paragraph 21. All approved budget\nitems shall be processed for payment through the School District's central finance office.\n31. The School District's plan shall contain a timetable for implementation of restructuring, including but not\nlimited to selection, training and development of staff, parents and others who will participate in local school\ngovernance, necessary alterations in grade configurations to develop consistency in instructional practices,\n557 guidelines for lengthening the school *557 day and school year, and appropriate changes in budget format for\npublic reporting purposes. The plan shall also include the proposed formula for school resource allocations which\nis needs based and ensures equity in the allocation of resources to racially isolated schools.\n32. The educational plan lacks a substantial or competent basis for recommendation no. 21 to eliminate regional\nsuperintendents and also fails to provide, as did the School District, an effective or reasonable alternative to a\nstructure which has not been shown to be dysfunctional. Recommendation 21 is therefore rejected. Due to the\nvast number of schools and students within the School District, an organizational structure must exist to\nsupervise school-based management efforts, to carry out system-wide policies within each region, to provide\ncommunity support to schools and parents, to perform all functions necessary to ensure that central office\nservices are effectively utilized by the schools and school-based management effectively implemented, and to\navoid the potential for 257 separate and independent school operations.\nAccountability\n33. The School District shall develop a proposal, including timetable, for monitoring of the School District's\nprogress in improving the quality and equity of the education it provides. The proposal shall provide for external\nas well as internal evaluation of the teaching and learning in each school; demonstrated effectiveness of the\nprofessional development effort; and effectiveness of the school governance structure relative to improvement of\ninstruction and academic achievement of students.\n34. The School District shall establish a system of accountability based on measures of student performance and\nachievement by developing appropriate assessment standards, and by developing and implementing an\nincentive system of graduated rewards and sanctions for teachers and administrators and students.\n35. The School District shall further develop as part of the school improvement and assessment process a\n558 program for *558 periodic reviews of each school covering instructional and other practices to be conducted by\n\ninternal and external evaluation, and shall develop a process for annual public reporting of student achievement\ndata by school and other indicators of school performance.\n36. The Court will not require the School District to develop the multiple layers of evaluation committees, teams,\nconsultants and accountability council recommended in the educational plan. It is enough if the School District\nhas an effective internal and external accountability system which accurately evaluates the School District's\nperformance.\nFacilities\n37. The School District shall develop a plan to identify, prioritize and complete repairs required in each school.\nThe plan shall evaluate the adequacy of maintenance staffing and accountability systems, and address how\nindividual schools will participate in setting priorities for repairs and facilitate the repair and maintenance process\nat the school level.\n38. The School District shall also evaluate the current method for deciding repair priorities and develop in\nconjunction with maintenance staff representatives a plan for the timely processing of repair orders and a\nprogram for resolving the unacceptable maintenance calls due to student graffiti and other vandalism. The plan\nshall also provide a method for reporting on the status of the School District's facilities in its public reports.\n39. The School District shall properly maintain, clean and repair school buildings and facilities and shall conduct\nan immediate facilities assessment of the racially isolated schools to determine repairs and maintenance needed\nand a timetable for completion giving priority to these schools. A plan shall be designed to institute a program of\nmaintenance and repair of racially isolated schools and shall include prompt and proper repair of leaking roofs,\nrestroom facilities, broken windows, and heating systems. The School District shall secure the assistance and\n559 services of parents and the community *559 to embark upon a program of cooperation in facilities repair and\nmaintenance.\nOvercrowding\n40. The School District shall address school overcrowding and shall develop a plan which includes timetables for\nnew building construction, additions, and renovation of existing school facilities. The School District shall detail\nhow it will evaluate existing building capacity to determine the need for new facilities, their location, and impact on\nthe expansion of voluntary desegregation opportunities.\nReporting and Monitoring\n41. The School District shall develop a proposal for reporting to the Court and to the parties on the School\nDistrict's adherence to and progress under its reform agenda. The reporting proposal shall identify the data and\ninformation which will allow the School District, the Court and the parties to assess the quality and effectiveness\nof reform efforts and to identify racial disparities which require correction.\n42. The reporting proposal shall include a bi-annual reporting timetable for 1994-1995, 1995-1996, and\n1996-1997, and thereafter annual reporting, and shall identify the staff and/or office responsible for satisfying\neach aspect of the reporting plan. The first bi-annual report is due July 3, 1995, and the School District shall\ndemonstrate, beginning with the 1996-1997 school year if not sooner, reductions in the racial disparities in\nacademic achievement of its students\n43. The Court shall conduct its independent monitoring of the School District's implementation of its plan and\nshall appoint a three-member body to serve as the Court monitoring committee to review and evaluate the School\nDistrict's plan to be submitted by February 15, 1995. The committee shall review the periodic reports submitted to\nthe Court by the School District, and regularly consult with the Superintendent and other appropriate School\nDistrict personnel to evaluate the implementation process. The Court monitoring committee shall make periodic\n\n560 reports to the Court containing an evaluation of the implementation progress and appropriate *560\nrecommendations for changes required to ensure compliance with the order.\n44. The Court shall appoint a seven-member advisory committee to the Court monitors. The advisory committee\nwill include a representative selected by the Human Relations Commission and each of the Intervenors, and\neducational, business and community representatives. The U.S. Department of Education, Office of the Regional\nRepresentative, has consented to participate in the monitoring process and shall serve in an advisory capacity as\nneeded.\n45. Pursuant to prior decisions of this Court, the Human Relations Commission has the ultimate responsibility for\nmonitoring the School District's implementation of an approved plan and shall continue in its monitoring role to\nensure the School District's compliance with the law.\n46. The Court shall retain jurisdiction in this matter until evidence is presented to demonstrate compliance with\nthe Court's order.\n[1] U.S. Department of Education, Report on School-Based Management 00 The Changing Focus of Control in\n97\nAmerican Public Education, February 1994; Summers & Johnson, Review of Evidence on the Effects of School-\nBased Management Plans, University of Pennsylvania, August 1994 (study discusses decentralization process\nsweeping the nation in school reform).\n[2] The School District should be guided by other significant federal legislation or directive in developing and\nimplementing its educational reform efforts. The Goals 2000: Educate America Act of March 31, 1994, Pub.L. No.\n103-227, and the School-To-Work Opportunities Act of May 4, 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-239, promote the goal of\nstudents achieving at high levels and offer educational and student job training goals for school districts to reach.\nSee also Human Services Amendments of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-252. On October 22, 1994, the President issued\na directive to the U.S. Department of Education requiring school districts to expel students for up to one year if\ncaught in school in possession of a weapon, and the failure of a school district to act may result in the loss of\nfederal funds.\n[3] Strong Families, Strong Schools, Report of U.S. Department of Education, September 1994; First Things First,\nWhat Americans Expect From Public Schools, Report from the Public Agenda Foundation, New York, N.Y.,\nOctober 1994; Putting Learning First, Committee for Economic Development, New York, N.Y., 1994.\n[4] The School District has filed a motion to join the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Governor Robert E.\nCasey, and ASPIRA has filed a motion to join the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia in\nthis action pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 2232(c). The School District's liability for compliance with the Court's order is\nnot, however, conditioned upon a joinder of the Commonwealth or the City which can be sued in a separate\nfunding action. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School Dist. of Philadelphia (HRC V), 167\nPa.Commonwealth Ct. 1, 651 A.2d 177 (1993),aff'd,161 Pa.Cmwlth. 658, 638 A.2d 304 (1994)). Nevertheless,\nbecause extensive evidence of racial disparity has been fully documented and the issue of financial ability to\nremedy the disparity has been again raised, for the sake of judicial economy the Court will permit the parties to\nrenew their motions for joinder after the School District has submitted an approved educational plan and\nundergone an independent performance and financial audit to identify economies and all funds available to pay\nrealistic cost projections for implementation of the Court's order. The School District's Exhibit PPP will require\nextensive revision to develop a rational and thorough cost analysis, particularly as to professional development\ncosts, pre-school, kindergarten and reduced class size projections, debt service for new construction which fails\nto reflect an analysis of existing facilities under-utilization, and lack of foundation for a $91.6 million voluntary\nmentor/monitoring program.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Commonwealth Ct. 1 (1993)\n651 A.2d 177\nPENNSYLVANIA HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION, Petitioner,\nv.\nSCHOOL DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA, Respondent and Harry and Annemarie Gwynne,\nASPIRA of Pennsylvania, et al., Intervenors.\nCommonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.\nDecided June 4, 1993.\nPublication Ordered November 28, 1994.\n3 *3 Elizabeth S. Shuster, Chief Counsel, and Michael Hardiman, Asst. Chief Counsel, for petitioner.\nWilliam H. Brown, III, and Christina Rainville, for respondent.\nMichael Churchill, Richard Z. Freemann, Jr., and Daniel W. Cantu-Hertzler, for intervenors.\nSMITH, Judge.\nWithout exhaustively reciting the decades-long procedural history of the Philadelphia public school desegregation\n[1]\ncase culminating in the current appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,  this Opinion will address this\nCourt's April 14, 1993 order which granted motions for directed verdict on the issue of mandatory busing for\n4 school desegregation purposes and denied motions to join, in these proceedings, as indispensable *4 and\nnecessary parties the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Governor of Pennsylvania, the Department of\nEducation, and certain contiguous suburban school districts (Upper Darby, Interboro, Haverford, Lower Merion,\nAbington, Cheltenham, Colonial, Springfield, Lower Moreland, Bensalem and Neshaminy.)\nI.\nOn March 17, 1993, this Court commenced hearings on the issue of the compliance of Respondent, the School\nDistrict of Philadelphia, with an April 15, 1982 order of this Court directing the District to:\nmodify its 1976 Voluntary Desegregation Plan to correct racial imbalance, as measured by the\n[Petitioner's] Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission's new (1979) definition of a segregated\nschool, suggesting that in so doing serious consideration be given to the following:\n(1) the pairing of elementary schools . . .; and\n(2) the reassignment of pupils affected by school closings in a fashion which will promote\ndesegregation rather than perpetuate segregation.\nSuch modifications shall be submitted to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission on or\nbefore July 1, 1982.\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia, 66 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 154,\n180-81, 443 A.2d 1343, 1355 (1982). The hearings themselves evolved as follows.\nOn June 30, 1982, the District submitted a plan entitled \"Proposal for Modification.\" The plan contained no\nmandatory desegregation measures. Rejecting the proposed modification, the Commission, the entity statutorily\n[2]\ncharged with alleviating school segregation,  returned to this Court for enforcement. Prior to any additional\njudicial intervention, however, the District submitted yet another plan referred to as the 1983 Modified\n5 Desegregation Plan which encompassed *5 three components: educational improvement plan, desegregation\nexpansion strategy, and reduction of racially isolated schools.\n\nDespite Commission reservations as to the purely voluntary nature of the \"modified plan,\" as it became known,\nand in an effort to avoid continued litigation, the Commission and the District executed a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding on October 24, 1983 pursuant to which the modified plan would be implemented for a three-year\nperiod. If, after three years, either party was not satisfied that the plan had achieved, in the words of the\nMemorandum, \"maximum feasible desegregation,\" the matter would be referred to a Settlement Team appointed\nby the parties to independently evaluate progress toward achieving maximum feasible desegregation and report\nits findings to the Court and the parties.\nFor three years the District implemented the modified plan and submitted annual reports to the Commission. In\nJune 1988, the Commission concluded that maximum feasible desegregation had not been achieved under the\nmodified plan. On June 27, 1988, the Commission and the District entered into a joint stipulation acknowledging\ntheir inability to agree on the issue of accomplishing maximum feasible desegregation and invoking the creation\nof a Settlement Team.\nIn November, 1992, the Settlement Team completed its formal findings included among which was a\nrecommendation for the pairing of several schools which would require mandatory reassignment per busing.\nFollowing completion of the Settlement Team Report, this Court entertained oral argument during which the\nDistrict indicated its disagreement with the Report. The District responded that it had complied with this Court's\n[3]\nApril 15, 1982 order to the extent feasible.  This Court scheduled hearings and permitted interested parties to\nrequest intervention. Prior to commencement of the first evidentiary hearing on March 18, 1993, this Court\nentertained and granted intervention to the parties indicated below.\n6 *6 Intervention was granted to three sets of intervenors. They are: first, Olney-Oak Lane-Feltonville Parents for\nBetter Schools, the Lowell Home and School Association and the Finletter Home and School Association which\ncollectively represent families in the District who challenge the mandatory busing of students particularly as it\nregards school overcrowding implications; second, the Coalition of Concerned Citizens for Quality Education\nwhich represents parents and students opposed to mandatory busing measures as a method of desegregation;\nand third, ASPIRA of Pennsylvania, Citizens Committee on Public Education in Philadelphia, Fellowship\nCommission, Parents Union for Public Schools, Philadelphia Association of School Administrators, and the\nPhiladelphia Home and School Council which in tandem represent parents, students and school administrators\nseeking to insure equal opportunities for quality education.\nAt the close of the fourth hearing held on April 8, 1993, the Commission rested its case whereupon both the\nDistrict and Intervenor Coalition of Concerned Citizens for Quality Education moved for a directed verdict on the\nbasis of, inter alia, the Commission's having failed to demonstrate that mandatory desegregation measures were\nfeasible. This Court treated the motions as though for compulsory nonsuit in partially granting them by order\n[4]\ndated April 14, 1993.  It is from this decision that the Commission has appealed. (In the interest of judicial\neconomy, this Court certified its interlocutory order for immediate appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. \nSee 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b).)\nII.\nA motion for directed verdict is properly posed at the close of all the evidence. See Pa.R.C.P. No. 226. This\nCourt, however, will treat the motions as if they were for compulsory nonsuit. See Pa.R.C.P. No. 126. The legal\n7 standard for *7 determining either is essentially the same and is one which is so familiar as to be formularistic.\nA motion for a compulsory nonsuit allows a defendant to test the sufficiency of a plaintiff's\nevidence. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Razumic, 480 Pa. 366, 390 A.2d 736 (1978). A judgment of\nnonsuit can be entered only in clear cases, and a plaintiff must be given the benefit of all evidence\nfavorable to him, together with all reasonable inferences of fact arising therefrom, and any conflict\nin the evidence must be resolved in the plaintiff's favor.\n. . . . .\n\nRule 230.1 establishes several distinct elements to be met before a nonsuit may be granted. One\nis that the plaintiff's case on liability must be closed. Another is that nonsuit must be requested\nbefore any evidence on behalf of the defendant has been introduced. A third is that the plaintiff\nmust have failed to establish a right to relief.\nRobinson v. City of Philadelphia, 149 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 163, 167-68, 612 A.2d 630, 632-33 (1992). See also\nRizzo v. Michener, 401 Pa.Superior Ct. 47, 584 A.2d 973 (1990),appeal denied,528 Pa. 613, 596 A.2d 159\n(1991). Compare Thompson v. Maryland & Pennsylvania R. R. Preservation Society, 417 Pa.Superior Ct. 216,\n222, 612 A.2d 450, 453 (1992),appeal denied, 533 Pa. 635, 621 A.2d 581 (1993) (\"In deciding a motion for a\ndirected verdict, the trial court must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the party against whom the\nmotion is made and must accept as true all evidence which supports that party's contention and must reject all\nadverse testimony.\")\nThis Court has stated that it is the burden of the Commission to introduce \"substantial evidence\" in support of its\nposition that the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 P. S. §§ 951-963, has been violated. See J. Howard\nBrandt, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 15 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 123, 324 A.2d 840 (1974).\n8 \"`Substantial evidence' means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind *8 might accept as adequate to\nsupport a conclusion.\" Id. at 130, 324 A.2d at 843.\nHow heavy a burden, and by whom it is borne, is one never specifically articulated in the context of enforcement\nproceedings in school desegregation cases in this Commonwealth. The history of this litigation is not, however,\nwithout its instruction. In the first Opinion emanating from this Court, Judge Wilkinson wrote of a \"record\ncompletely barren of testimony concerning . . . whether there is any need for a change in the employment\npractices of the district.\" 6 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. at 290, 294 A.2d at 414. In like vein, this Court alluded to the\nburden of proof when it later wrote: \"[T]he narrow issue presently before us is that of whether the Commission's\ndetermination that there has been insufficient progress toward the desegregation of Philadelphia's public schools\nas the result of efforts pursuant to the 1976 Voluntary Plan is adequately supported by the evidence of record.\"\n66 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. at 174-75, 443 A.2d at 1352 (emphasis added). Thus it is the Commission which\nlogically and legally bears the burden of adducing evidence in support of its determinations as to the efficacy of a\nplan devised by the District and as to the curative measures needed.\nIII.\nInstantly the Commission bore the burden of demonstrating that the District had failed to achieve maximum\n[5]\nfeasible desegregation  and that this failure could be cured by means of, inter alia, mandatory busing. With\n9 respect to the *9 use of mandatory desegregation measures, particularly busing, the Commission failed to carry\nits burden as manifested by the following evidentiary recapitulation.\nMr. Homer Floyd has been the Executive Director of the Commission since February 2, 1970. On direct\nexamination he testified as to the modified plan and its tripartite components. In 1987 the Commission began its\nreview of the plan in light of the common goal of reaching maximum feasible desegregation. The Commission\n[6]\nultimately concluded that the modified plan, which did not require reassignment or pairing,  had not met the\ngoal; hence, the matter proceeded to the Settlement Team which in November, 1992 concurred in the\nCommission's conclusion. On cross-examination Mr. Floyd stated that although the Commission could have\nmade suggestions as the District submitted its requisite annual progress reports, the Commission instead chose\nto inform the District of its noncompliance after the three-year implementation period.\nThe Commission took the position that neither kindergartners nor special education students should be\n[7]\nreassigned,  and it also drew the mandatory busing line at 45 minutes from point of origin to point of\ndestination. The Commission long ago accepted the fact that limits must be placed on the amount of time school\nchildren are required to travel to and from school. See66 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. at 178, 443 A.2d at 1354. Mr.\nFloyd stated, however, that the Commission never discussed desegregation in the context of mandatory busing\nand, indeed, does not have a position with respect thereto.\n\nSee, we don't have a position on busing. We've never taken 00 we have absolutely no position on\n97\nbusing one way or the other. Our position is on desegregation. And as a part of desegregation\nthere is an arsenal of tools that you can use, whether it's pairing of schools, whether it's closure of\n10 schools or reassignment of changes, attendance boundary *10 lines. There's magnet schools,\nthere's satelliting. There's [sic] all those kinds of desegregation methods.\nN. T. 3/18/93 at 210-11.\nWhen asked whether the Commission had recommended pairings which would require busing students from the\nfar northeastern part of the City, the area of greatest white student concentration and isolation, to its center or\nwestern regions, Mr. Floyd replied:\nI think there's a better person to answer that question than I. It is my understanding as part of the\ndiscussions that took place between the School District, our staff, and the Settlement Team was\n[sic] a number of discussions about pairings. And there were some charts used and so forth.\nThose were not necessarily Commission-recommended pairings. They were proposals or ideas\nthat were thrown out for discussion, most of which the School District rejected.\nId. at 219. Nonetheless he acknowledged that the Commission does not oppose the pairings which the\nSettlement Team proposed in its Report. Proceeding on the assumption that desegregation could be\naccomplished within existing budgetary constraints, the Commission concluded that maximum feasible\ndesegregation had not been achieved on account of achievement test and desegregation data it did review.\nMr. Anliot, the only other witness for the Commission, stated that he had worked for the Commission for thirty-\nseven years. For thirty-five of those years he directed its Department of Education and Community Services.\nThrough him the Commission introduced a number of Exhibits relating to desegregation and achievement test\nstatistics. When questioned on cross-examination as to the proposed pairings, Mr. Anliot testified as follows:\nQ: Did you ever measure, you yourself, the distances between the schools that the\nrecommendation has been to pair?\nA: Yes.\n11 *11 Q: You did that yourself?\nA: Yes.\nQ: And which schools did you measure the distance between and when?\nA: It was the distance and the travel time between an elementary school in the Far Northeast and\nschools that were west of Broad Street?\nQ: Which school in the Northeast did you visit to measure the distance?\nA: I don't recall specifically now without 00\n97\n. . . .\nQ: But I would take it that other than that one time, that's the only time you actually measured\nsome distances?\nA: Time of travel; yes.\nQ: That's right. And at no time in those 20 years of the history of this case did you ever measure\nthe distance between a specific school and another school?\nA: Yes, I did; by the scale on the map of the School District.\nQ: But not by driving it?\n\nA: That's correct.\nN. T. 4/8/93 at pp. 659, 664. Moreover, Mr. Anliot professed his belief in the \"probability\" that he could measure\ndriving time by looking at a map which did not indicate stoplights, stop signs, detours or traffic volume. Id. at\n743-44.\nThe Commission introduced 14 Exhibits, all of which were admitted into the record except Exhibits 5 and 8.\nExhibits one through seven can be characterized as relevant to the history of this litigation and include, inter alia,\nthe District's modified plan, Memorandum of Understanding, Joint Stipulation, and Report of the Settlement\nTeam. Exhibits nine through fourteen reflect data compiled and analyzed by Mr. Anliot in his efforts to measure\n12 desegregation progress under the modified plan. None of the Exhibits purports to analyze *12 the feasibility of\n[8]\nscholastic pairings or their relationship to increased desegregation.\nAs the Petitioner, the Commission was charged with demonstrating that the District's plan had not achieved\nmaximum, or even feasible, desegregation. Feasible has been variously defined as: \"Capable of being done,\nexecuted, affected or accomplished. Reasonable assurance of success. See Possible,\" Black's Law Dictionary\n549 (5th ed. 1979); \"[t]hat [which] may be done, performed, executed or effected; practicable; possible.\"\nWebster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary 669 (2d ed. 1978). Instantly the Commission proffered no evidence\nin support of the proposition that mandatory busing would effectuate further desegregation than has been\naccomplished under the modified plan, and it neither proved the feasibility of mandatory reassignment per busing\nnor any cause and effect relationship between busing, if indeed it were feasible, and increased desegregation.\nUnder these circumstances, this Court was required to grant the respective motions as to this issue.\nIV.\nIn addition to the appeal of the Commission there is one filed by the District which complains that this Court\nshould have granted its motion to join the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Governor of Pennsylvania, the\nDepartment of Education and contiguous suburban school districts as indispensable and necessary parties. The\nDistrict also contends it was error not to have granted the District's motion for a directed verdict in its entirety.\na.\n13 The District asserts that only a metropolitan school district, spanning the contiguous suburban school districts, \n*13 would put an end to segregation within its boundaries which in actuality devolves from artificial, state-created\ndistricting. Moreover, the District argues, without the joinder of the Governor and the Department of Education,\nany resolution devised by these proceedings will be futile because the financial wherewithal will be lacking. This\nCourt has been presented with both issues in prior phases of this litigation.\nWriting for a unanimous Court in 1976, Judge Rogers rejected the District's earlier bid to compel the creation of a\nmetropolitan school district for purposes of increasing the pool of white students available to desegregate its\nschools.\nThe District, of course, concedes that its proposal, which to our knowledge has been a subject of\npublic discussion but without action for at least ten years, is beyond the District's power to\nimplement and the Commission's power to order. It is just as certainly beyond our power to\ncompel and must be rejected. State policy seems thus far to be that Philadelphia should single-\nhandedly struggle with the State's statute mandating the integration of the public schools,\nwhatever the difficulties.\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia, 23 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 312,\n327, 352 A.2d 200, 209 (1976),aff'd,480 Pa. 398, 390 A.2d 1238 (1978) (emphasis added).\nLikewise writing for a majority Court, Judge Wilkinson addressed the issue of financing a desegregation plan in\n1972.\n\nThe Court is very sympathetic with the position of the School [District] that it is futile to require the\ndistricts to submit plans that would meet the minimum requirements of the Commission when the\nincreased costs incident to such plans, i. e. busing, installation of cafeterias, lunch programs, etc.,\nare beyond the financial capabilities of the Districts. However, the costs cannot be determined with\nany accuracy until a minimum acceptable plan is submitted. Whether it can be implemented within\n14 the financial capabilities of the [District], together with such support from other sources as*14can\nbe generated and with any realignment of priorities, will have to be determined at that time.\nPhiladelphia School District v. Human Relations Commission, 6 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 281, 287, 294 A.2d 410,\n413 (1972),aff'd, 455 Pa. 52, 313 A.2d 156 (1973) (emphasis added). Together these prior pronouncements\nrequired a denial of the District's joinder requests under the doctrine of the law of the case meaning that\n\"whatever is once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule of decision between the same parties in the\nsame case continues to be the law of the case.\" Tyro Industries, Inc. v. James A. Wood Inc., 418 Pa.Superior Ct.\n296, 305, 614 A.2d 279, 284 (1992), quoting Banker v. Valley Forge Insurance Co., 401 Pa.Superior Ct. 367,\n374, 585 A.2d 504, 508,appeal denied, 529 Pa. 615, 600 A.2d 532 (1991). It should be noted that neither the\nDistrict nor the Commission appealed this Court's refusal to order creation of a metropolitan school district. Also,\nthe District has legal recourse to resolve any separate issues pertaining to Commonwealth funding for\ndesegregation expenditures. See In re Emery, 138 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 668, 589 A.2d 283 (1991).\nEven if this Court were to reach the merits of the District's joinder arguments, the result would be no different.\nThe District asserts the additional parties are indispensable and necessary to this litigation. They are neither. An\nindispensable party is one whose rights are so connected with the litigated claims as to be infringed upon if any\nrelief is granted. Reichley v. North Penn School District, 113 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 528, 537 A.2d 391 (1988).\nOnly if the merits of a case can be determined without prejudice to the rights of the absent party may the court\nproceed. Mechanicsburg Area School District v. Kline, 494 Pa. 476, 431 A.2d 953 (1988). On the other hand a\nnecessary party is one whose presence, while not indispensable, is essential if the court is to resolve completely\na controversy and to render complete relief. York-Adams County Constables Assoc. v. Court of Common Pleas of\nYork County, 81 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 566, 474 A.2d 79 (1984). The District has failed to argue or to\ndemonstrate facts sufficient to join the additional parties on either basis.\n15  b.\n*15\nThe District also contends it was error for this Court not to have granted its motion for a directed verdict in its\nentirety, that is, to have found the Commission's evidence sufficient to proceed on the issues of voluntary\ndesegregation methods and the educational improvement component of the modified plan. In its modified plan,\nthe District established the following educational improvement goals:\n00 To assure equal educational opportunities and equality of access to excellence to all students\n95\nregardless of the schools they attend.\n00 To provide educational offerings and specialized programs designed to attract a diverse\n95\napplicant pool.\n00 To reorganize educational offerings and to effect a measurable improvement in student\n95\nperformance at designated Priority I Educational Improvement schools.\n00 To respond to the unique educational concerns of students who will be attending racially\n95\nisolated schools.\nThrough Mr. Anliot the Commission introduced Exhibits 10, 11, 12, 13, 13A and 14, each prepared by Mr. Anliot.\nAggregately the Exhibits, when accorded the proper evidentiary weight, demonstrate that little progress, if any,\n16 has been made in desegregating Philadelphia's public school classrooms[9]*16 through implementation of\nadditional voluntary measures or in improving the quality of education by eliminating racial inequalities. For\nexample, between 1983 and 1987 the modified plan resulted in a new increase of two non-segregated schools\n\nrepresenting a total percentage increase of 2%. See Exhibit 10 at p. 3. During the same time frame more than\none-half of the schools in Philadelphia remained black-segregated although there was a one percent net\ndecrease from 52% to 51%. Id. The number of high schools deemed black-segregated increased from 50% to\n53%. Id. No improvement was seen between 1987 and 1990, the last year for which the Commission provided\nstatistical data on desegregation. The total number of non-segregated senior high schools and vocational/\ntechnical high schools stayed the same; and the total number of non-segregated middle/junior high schools\n[10]\ndropped from 15 to 8 and of non-segregated elementary schools from 42 to 40. Exhibit 13A at p. 1.\nAt the same time that voluntary desegregation measures were falling demonstrably short, the District's attempts\nat educational improvement also deteriorated. Standardized test results reflected consistently lower scores for\nBlacks and Hispanics thereby belying any improvement in the quality of education the District purportedly\nafforded these youngsters. See Exhibits 12, 14. For example, the Commission's analysis of data for the 1986-87\nschool year shows that 68% of Black students and 77% of Hispanic students in grades 3, 5 and 8 were in need of\nremedial instruction in reading; and during the same year test results showed a need for remedial instruction in\nmathematics at 61% for Blacks and 66% for Hispanics in these same grades as compared to 42% and 36%\n17 respectively *17 for white students. Exhibit 12 at p. 3. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the\nCommission, this Court properly denied the District's motion for a directed verdict on the remaining issues before\nthe Court.\nATTACHMENT\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 14th day of April, 1993, upon consideration of the School District's motion to join additional\ndefendants and motion for directed verdict, Intervenor Coalition of Concerned Citizens' motion for directed\nverdict, and argument by counsel on April 13, 1993, the Court enters the following order:\n1. The School District's motion to join as additional defendants the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Governor\nRobert P. Casey, and the Pennsylvania Department of Education is hereby denied. The School District failed to\npresent sufficient legal basis for its argument that the Commonwealth, Governor and Department of Education\nare indispensable parties to this litigation, Mechanicsburg Area School Dist. v. Kline, 494 Pa. 476, 431 A.2d 953\n(1981), or that this Court possesses the legal authority to compel the Commonwealth in these proceedings to\nappropriate additional resources to fund school desegregation measures which may be ordered by the Court.\nAlso, the School District has legal recourse to resolve the separate issue of any obligations by the\nCommonwealth to fund district desegregation expenditures. See In re Emery, 138 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 668,\n589 A.2d 283 (1991).\nThe School District's request to join as additional defendants the school districts of Upper Darby, Interboro,\nHaverford, Lower Merion, Abington, Cheltenham, Colonial, Springfield, Lower Moreland, Bensalem, and\nNeshaminy is likewise denied. The School District's proposal for creation of a metropolitan school district was\n18 previously rejected by this Court on the basis that it lacks power and authority to compel *18 joinder of adjacent\nschool districts. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 23\nPa.Commonwealth Ct. 312, 352 A.2d 200 (1976). It is for the Legislature of this Commonwealth to resolve this\nquestion.\n2. As to the motions for directed verdict, the Human Relations Commission has failed to meet its burden to prove\nthat mandatory busing of students would represent an appropriate or realistic measure to further desegregate\nPhiladelphia's public schools. The Court therefore rejects the Settlement Team's proposal for mandatory busing\nas a means to further desegregate Philadelphia's public schools, and accordingly will no longer consider\nmandatory busing as an issue in this case.\nThe motions for directed verdict are denied as to the remaining issues before the Court relating to whether the\nSchool District has failed to comply with the educational improvement component of its modified desegregation\nplan by eliminating racial inequalities in the provision of educational resources and opportunities within the\n\nPhiladelphia public school system; and whether the School District has failed to implement additional voluntary\nmeasures to further desegregate and improve the quality of education in its public schools.\n3. Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b), any party to this action may seek interlocutory appellate review of this order\nsince it involves a controlling question of law as to which there may be substantial ground for difference of\nopinion and from which an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of this case. A full\nopinion shall be issued by the Court in the event of immediate appeal to the Supreme Court or upon ultimate\nresolution of the remaining issues before the Court.\n[1]See, Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia, 66 Pa.Commonwealth Ct.\n154, 443 A.2d 1343 (1982); Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia, 30\nPa.Commonwealth Ct. 644, 374 A.2d 1014 (1977),aff'd,480 Pa. 398, 390 A.2d 1238 (1978); Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia, 23 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 312, 352 A.2d 200\n(1976),aff'd,480 Pa. 398, 390 A.2d 1238 (1978); Philadelphia School District v. Human Relations Commission, 6\nPa.Commonwealth Ct. 281, 294 A.2d 410 (1972),aff'd, 455 Pa. 52, 313 A.2d 156 (1973).\n[2]See the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. §§\n951-963.\n[3] Neither currently nor at any time during the pendency of this litigation has the Commission complained of de\njure segregation by the District.\n[4] This Court ruled that the evidence regarding other ameliorative measures, namely further voluntary\ndesegregation methods and educational improvements, was sufficient to withstand the motions.\n[5] A Commission witness defined \"maximum feasible desegregation\" as: \"[A] plan that would conform to the\namended final order of the Commission, conforming to the recommended elements of the desegregation plan;\nand where there is nonconformity to those elements, persuasive and substantial justification as to why not.\" N.T.\n3/19/93 at p. 240. While this Court recognizes that the District and the Commission adopted this standard\npursuant to their Memorandum of Understanding, it nonetheless represents a legitimate, legal formulation of the\nDistrict's duty in light of this Court's prior mandates, specifically its order of April 15, 1982. See e.g.,30\nPa.Commonwealth Ct. at 647, 374 A.2d at 1016 (school district to be permitted to implement plan it feels \"will\naccomplish desegregation with a minimum of disruption and a maximum of educational value.\").\n[6] Under the Commission definition, pairing is the mandatory reassignment of students. See N. T. 3/18/93 at p.\n215.\n[7] In the case of special education students, reassignment could be mandated provided the special education\nservices could be duplicated in the receiving school.\n[8] Exhibit 7 is the Report of the Settlement Team containing recommended pairings which would be mandatory\nand require busing the reassigned students. Although the Commission chose to rely on this Report as evidentiary\nsupport with respect to mandatory reassignment, this Court is not bound to accord it the evidentiary sufficiency\nthereby sought. In any event the Report does not purport to examine the feasibility of busing students between\nthe paired schools.\n[9] Mr. Anliot utilized three desegregation or non-segregated definitions in his statistical measurements: first, that\nadopted by the Commission in 1979 and mandated by this Court in 1979, see 66 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. at\n180-81, 443 A.2d at 1355; second, that proposed in the Superintendent's Report of August 23, 1983; and third,\nthat adopted by the District in 1983 as a revised definition. Under the first the definition states: \"a `non\nsegregated' school in Philadelphia has at least 25% White enrollment and at least 40% Black enrollment; or has\nat least 20% Hispanic enrollment, and at least 25% White enrollment, and at least 25% Black enrollment.\" Exhibit\n9 at p. 2. Under the second, the definition states: \"A school will be considered `desegregated' if its White\npopulation is within a 25-60% range and its Black/Hispanic/Asian population is within 40-75%.\" Id. at p. 1 quoting\n\"The Second Interim Report on Desegregation Planning,\" August 23, 1983 at p. 5. Under the third the definition\nstates: \"A school will be considered desegregated when its White enrollment is within a 25-60 percent range and\n\nits Black/Hispanic/Asian enrollment is within 40-75 percent.\" Exhibit 13A at p. 3 quoting \"To Educate all our\nChildren, Proposed Modifications to the Desegregation Plan of the School District of Philadelphia,\" October 3,\n1983, revised October 23, 1983 at p. 8. \nCurrent student enrollment data shows a 77% minority student population.\n[10] This Opinion does not exhaustively examine the evidence in this regard. Rather, it cites to examples which\nmore than satisfy denial of the District's motion in its entirety.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Commonwealth Ct. 658 (1994)\n638 A.2d 304\nPENNSYLVANIA HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION, Petitioner,\nv.\nSCHOOL DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA, Respondent, and Harry and Annemarie Gwynne,\nAspira of Pennsylvania, et al., Intervenors.\nCommonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.\nDecided February 4, 1994.\n660 *660 Elisabeth S. Shuster, Chief Counsel, and Michael Hardiman, Asst. Chief Counsel, for petitioner.\n661 *661 William H. Brown, III, and Christina Rainville, for respondent.\nMichael Churchill, Richard Z. Freemann, Jr., and Daniel W. Cantu-Hertzler, for intervenors.\nSMITH, Judge.\nBefore the Court is the latest chapter in litigation between the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission\n(Commission) and the Philadelphia School District spanning almost twenty-three years during which the\nCommission has sought to compel the School District to comply with orders of the Commission and this Court to\ndesegregate Philadelphia's public schools.\nI.\nBackground\nThe Commission issued its initial adjudication on June 7, 1971 pursuant to Sections 1-13 of the Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Act, Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. §§ 951-963, in which the\nCommission determined that the Philadelphia School District was unlawfully segregated by race and ordered the\nSchool District to develop and submit to the Commission a plan to eliminate the racial imbalance in its schools\nover a three-year period. On appeal by the School District, this Court affirmed the Commission's order requiring\nthe District to correct the de facto segregation within its schools but remanded the matter to the Commission for\nnecessary modifications of its order as to staff recruitment and assignment. Philadelphia School Dist. v.\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission (HRC I), 6 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 281, 294 A.2d 410 (1972),aff'd,\n455 Pa. 52, 313 A.2d 156 (1973). Thereafter, the Commission issued an amended final order dated September\n25, 1972 requiring the School District to submit a plan by January 1973 to eliminate racial imbalance in its\nschools in conformity with the Commission's recommended elements of a school desegregation plan. The School\n662 District *662 neither appealed the Court's order nor submitted the ordered plan, prompting enforcement\nproceedings by the Commission.\nPursuant to a November 14, 1973 order of this Court, the District submitted a plan in 1974 which the Commission\nrejected and subsequently filed a second enforcement petition. Another plan was submitted by the School District\nin 1975 although it argued that full compliance with this Court's directive was impossible because of the District's\nfinancial deficits and refusal of funding by the Commonwealth. That plan proposed to create a metropolitan\nschool district among Philadelphia and ten adjacent school districts. The Court en banc in Pennsylvania Human\nRelations Commission v. School Dist. of Philadelphia (HRC II), 23 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 312, 352 A.2d 200\n(1976), rejected the 1975 plan as it was beyond the District's power to implement, the Commission's power to\norder, and this Court's power to compel. The School District was thereupon ordered to submit a definitive plan\nand timetable for implementation to cure racial imbalance in the District's schools. The case was once again\nremanded to the Commission with jurisdiction retained by this Court.\n\nIn 1976, the School District submitted to the Commission a voluntary desegregation plan centered around a new\nmagnet school program allowing students and their parents to select a school of their choice so long as the\nselection was consistent with desegregation. The Commission rejected the plan because it was entirely voluntary\nand returned to Commonwealth Court to enforce its amended final order and the Court's order in HRC II. This\nCourt however denied the Commission's enforcement petition in July 1977 and directed the School District to\nimplement its 1976 voluntary desegregation plan but authorized the Commission to return to court if dissatisfied\nwith the School District's results. See Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School Dist. of Philadelphia\n(HRC III), 30 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 644, 374 A.2d 1014 (1977),aff'd,480 Pa. 398, 390 A.2d 1238 (1978).\nIn July 1980, the Commission again petitioned this Court to compel the School District to submit a desegregation\n663 plan which included mandatory measures because the District's *663 efforts under the 1976 plan were\ninsufficient. In April 1982, this Court issued yet another opinion at Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v.\nSchool Dist. of Philadelphia (HRC IV), 66 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 154, 443 A.2d 1343 (1982), in which the School\nDistrict was ordered to modify its 1976 voluntary desegregation plan to achieve more comprehensive\ndesegregation as measured by the Commission's 1979 definition of a segregated school. In October 1983, the\nSchool District submitted proposed modifications to its 1976 plan (1983 modified plan) which the Commission\nrejected because of its continued non-compliance with this Court's order.\nNotwithstanding its rejection, the Commission agreed to execute a memorandum of understanding with the\nSchool District in which the Commission agreed to allow the School District a three-year period to implement its\n1983 modified plan. Subsequent to its evaluation of the three-year implementation period, the Commission\nnotified the School District in June 1988 that maximum feasible desegregation had not been achieved thereby\ninvoking terms of the agreement and authorizing the appointment of a settlement team to independently evaluate\nthe School District's progress toward desegregation. This settlement team, appointed by former President Judge\nCrumlish in July 1990, submitted a report in November 1992 in which the team found that a great majority of\nPhiladelphia's public schools are segregated and concurred that the School District had not achieved maximum\nfeasible desegregation.\nIntervention in the current enforcement proceedings was granted on April 2, 1993 to representative parent groups\n[1]\nand other interested parties.  After the initial phase of hearings in this matter, the Court entered an order on\n664 April 14, 1993 *664 granting in part the School District's motion for directed verdict, treated as a motion for\ncompulsory nonsuit, and ordered that mandatory busing would not be imposed by the Court as a means to\nfurther desegregate the District's schools because the Commission failed to prove the feasibility of mandatory\nbusing or that the School District's failure to achieve maximum feasible desegregation could be cured by such\nmeans. Nevertheless, trial would proceed as to whether the School District offered equal educational\nopportunities to its minority students and implemented all feasible measures to further desegregate the School\nDistrict by voluntary means. The Commission and School District filed separate petitions for permission to appeal\nwith the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which denied both petitions by order dated June 29, 1993. Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Commission v. School Dist. of Philadelphia (No. 1056 C.D.1973, filed June 4, 1993), aff'd,\n(Nos. 62, 63 Misc.Dkt. 1993, filed June 29, 1993).\nII.\nPreliminary Questions\n(a)\nThe School District presented its motion for directed verdict to the Court at the close of the record on November\n30, 1993 requesting that judgment be entered for the School District because neither the Commission nor\nIntervenors demonstrated that maximum feasible desegregation had not been achieved by the School District. A\nmotion for directed verdict may be granted only where the record makes it clear that the moving party is entitled\nto relief. In deciding a motion for directed verdict, courts must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe parties against whom the motion is made and must accept as true all evidence supporting those parties'\ncontentions and must reject all adverse testimony. Thompson v. Maryland & Pennsylvania R.R. Preservation\nSoc'y, 417 Pa.Superior Ct. 216, 612 A.2d 450 (1992),appeal denied, 533 Pa. 635, 621 A.2d 581 (1993).\n665 *665 In support of its motion, the School District argues that no evidence was offered to prove that any additional\nschools could have been desegregated since 1983 as no evidence was presented of specific pairings which\ncould have been accomplished without mandatory busing; no evidence was presented concerning a specific\nmagnet school which could have been created; nor was any other evidence presented which demonstrates that\nother measures could have been undertaken by the School District to further desegregate its schools. The\nDistrict again raised its lack of financial resources as a defense to this action and asserted that it is financially\nincapable of initiating any additional desegregation measures and for that reason this lengthy litigation should be\nended by the Court once and for all.\nAnother claim maintained by the School District is that no evidence was presented to show a correlation between\nalleged disparities in educational achievement of the District's students and desegregation. Contending that the\neducational achievement of minority students is irrelevant to this case, the School District erroneously states that\nthis Court did not require the School District to implement educational goals nor to eliminate any disparities in\neducational achievement. Hence, because the Commission and Intervenors failed to \"tie in\" achievement with\ndesegregation, they have failed to sustain their burden of proving a relationship between educational\nachievement and desegregation or stated another way, that desegregated schools tend to have higher test\nscores than racially isolated minority schools or that poor achievement of minority students is in any way\nconnected to the issue of desegregation.\nThe Court heard extensive testimony in this case, and it is quite evident from the voluminous record that the\nSchool District is not entitled to a directed verdict. The Commission has steadfastly maintained that the School\nDistrict has failed to comply with the orders to desegregate its schools or to correspondingly satisfy the terms of\nits 1983 modified plan which was formulated to improve racial imbalance in the schools and to provide\n666 educational opportunities for minority *666 students. As will be developed later, the Court is of the opinion that the\nrecord supports in substantial part the positions advanced by the parties against whom the motion for directed\nverdict is made. Moreover, the Court categorically rejects the School District's assertion that disparities in\neducational achievement are irrelevant. To the contrary, disparities in educational achievement of students within\nthe School District is one of the paramount and most fundamental issues presented in this case.\nIn Sheff v. O'Neill, 42 Conn.Supp. 172, 609 A.2d 1072 (1992), the question presented was whether the state's\naction or inaction with respect to providing a specific substantive level of education rose to a constitutional\nviolation and was therefore a question inappropriate for summary judgment. The defendant school district's\nposition that the constitution requires only legislation which makes education free and that the court may not\ninquire into the educational content of its students runs parallel to the position taken by the School District here.\nThe court denied summary judgment relief and appropriately responded that constitutionally mandated\neducational opportunity was not limited to expenditures per pupil but was also a requirement for a specific\nsubstantive level of education. See also Abbott v. Burke, 119 N.J. 287, 575 A.2d 359 (1990) (the New Jersey\nSupreme Court observed that money is only one element in assessing the level of education in poor urban\nschools; that new approaches different from conventional instruction must be taken if these schools are to\nsucceed; and that school funds can be used more effectively than being used today).\n(b)\nThe School District has argued that the Commission has no authority under the Human Relations Act to require\nreassignment of school pupils on a race-based admissions policy and cite Section 1310 of the Public School\nCode of 1949, Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as amended, 24 P.S. § 13-1310(a), which makes it unlawful for\nschools to make distinctions on account of the race or color of any pupil attending a public school. Even under\n667 the voluntary desegregation plan, the *667 School District contends that the race-based admissions policy is\nunlawful as students will be denied admission to schools solely on account of their race.\n\nWhether the law prohibits consideration of the race of students in making school assignments has been raised at\nvarious stages of this case by the School District. That question has been considered by courts and decided\ncontrary to the arguments raised. Race-conscious decisions are not prohibited in school desegregation matters.\nThe United States Supreme Court in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d\n260 (1986), held that the U.S. Constitution does not prohibit states from taking race into account in its educational\ndecisions; and in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750\n(1978), the justices concluded that to achieve diversity in school admissions, race is an appropriate\nconsideration. Morean v. Bd. of Educ. of Montclair, 42 N.J. 237, 200 A.2d 97 (1964).\nMoreover, this Court held in Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Bd. of Educ. of School Dist. of\nPittsburgh, 66 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 219, 444 A.2d 792 (1982), that the requirement of a compulsory\ndesegregation plan which mandatorily assigns students by race is not an unlawful or unconstitutional means to\nremedy de facto segregation; and in School Dist. of Pittsburgh v. Rankin, 39 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 222, 396\nA.2d 856 (1978), stated that the discretionary power of school boards regarding the assignment of students is\nlimited only by orders of the Commission.\nCommenting on a challenge to the Commission's jurisdiction, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court responded in \nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester School Dist., 427 Pa. 157, 164, 233 A.2d 290, 294\n(1967), that \"[t]he school district does not suggest that it would be unconstitutional for the Legislature to\ncommand them to consider race in their districting proposals in order to achieve a semblance of racial balance in\n668 its schools, nor do we believe there would be any merit in such a contention.\" Correspondingly, in reviewing *668\nthe legislative history behind the Human Relations Act, the Court noted that \"[h]ad the Legislature intended to\nreach by the 1961 amendments only de jure segregation, its legislative pronouncements would have been\nunnecessary. The 1954 Brown decision made it eminently clear that de jure segregation 00 racial isolation\n97\nproduced by the acts of public officials 00 is unconstitutional. A legislative pronouncement to this effect, and this\n97\n[2]\neffect only, would be mere gild on the lily.\" Id. at 169, 233 A.2d at 296.\nIn Kromnick v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 739 F.2d 894 (3d Cir.1984),cert. denied,469 U.S. 1107, 105 S.Ct.\n782, 83 L.Ed.2d 777 (1985), a case involving teacher assignments, the school district argued its right to assign\nteachers on the basis of race in an effort to promote a racially balanced teaching staff in the district's schools.\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that race-conscious faculty reassignment was a commonly ordered remedy in\nlitigation challenging de facto segregation. Had Congress, when it expanded Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\nJuly 2, 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., in 1972, intended to foreclose such a remedy, it would have so\nindicated; the legislative history of Title VII demonstrates concern for improving the education of students through\ndiversified staff. Thus the court found that applying a per se analysis to voluntary staff integration decisions by the\nSchool District to further the education of students in de facto segregated schools would be inconsistent with the\ncongressional intent underlying Title VII.\nBecause the Commission has the authority to order racially-based assignment of students to correct de facto\n669 segregation *669 of schools within this Commonwealth, it therefore follows that the School District is not\nprohibited from considering race in the assignment of its students. It is well settled that the inherent inequities in\nsegregated schools may not be corrected without consideration of race in connection with remedying the effects\nof unlawful segregation; and the School District's arguments to the contrary thus do not raise legally valid or\n[3]\nrecognizable claims and are consequently rejected.\n(c)\nThe School District has contended that under the United States Constitution, a court may not order adjustments\nin the racial composition of a school district's schools unless de jure segregation has been found, citing Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554,reh'g denied,403 U.S. 912, 91\nS.Ct. 2200, 29 L.Ed.2d 689 (1971), and that where de facto segregation exists, the school district has the\ndiscretion to desegregate its schools. Federal courts lack power to remedy de facto segregation as their authority\nextends only to cases of de jure segregation, Freeman v. Pitts, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 118 L.Ed.2d 108\n\n(1992); Bd. of Educ. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 111 S.Ct. 630, 112 L.Ed.2d 715\n(1991). State courts are not however precluded from remedying de facto segregation under state law. See also \nMilliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974).\nIn Chester School Dist., the court imposed upon school districts an obligation to provide equal educational\nopportunity to all students, and where necessary, the duty to initiate remedial programs to overcome the effects\n670 of discrimination *670 as equally as the court obligated those school districts to take corrective action to reduce\nracial imbalances, even though the discrimination or racial segregation was not caused by deliberate action of the\nschool district. Further, it was emphasized in HRC I that the desegregation case before the Court turned on the\nauthority of the Commission under the Human Relations Act only and did not raise a constitutional challenge.\nMoreover, an order by the Commission to integrate schools to foster the public policy of this Commonwealth to\nprovide an equal educational opportunity is not beyond the Commission's authority or power.

Accord Bd. of Educ. of Englewood Cliffs v. Bd. of Educ. of\nEnglewood, 257 N.J.Super. 413, 608 A.2d 914 (1992),aff'd,132 N.J. 327, 625 A.2d 483,cert. denied,___ U.S.\n___, 114 S.Ct. 547, 126 L.Ed.2d 449 (1993) (noting that nothing in Milliken or Freeman suggests that a state\ncourt is precluded from correcting de facto segregation to carry out state policy).\n(d)\nIn an April 14, 1993 order, the Court eliminated mandatory busing as a means to further desegregate the schools;\nand in the June 4, 1993 memorandum opinion filed in support of the order, the Court held that the Commission\ndid not prove the feasibility of mandatory reassignment of students via busing nor the \"cause and effect\"\nrelationship between busing and increased desegregation. Thus the School District's motion for directed verdict\nwas granted in part only. Where a matter has been previously ruled upon by a judge in the same case, the judge\nmay treat the earlier decision as the law of the case and should hesitate to change his or her ruling if the judge\nbelieves that it was correctly decided in the absence of some new or compelling circumstances. See Sanchez v.\nPhiladelphia Housing Auth., 148 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 329, 611 A.2d 346 (1992); Sheff.\n671 *671 The Commission continues to disagree with the correctness of the Court's decision and maintains its valid\nposition that physical segregation must be eliminated within the schools and that elimination of racial imbalances\nis a critical first step in achieving an integrated society. However, since a thorough and exhaustive review of the\nrecord and consideration of the various arguments presented by the parties have revealed no new or overriding\ncircumstances which mandate changing the Court's earlier ruling, it will therefore remain the law of this case.\nIII.\nThe Parties\nThe Commission has argued throughout this litigation that the purpose of the Human Relations Act is to promote\nan equal educational opportunity for all of the students attending the public schools within this Commonwealth\nand that this opportunity is enforceable by the Commission and courts of this Commonwealth. See Sections 2(b),\n3 of the Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. §§ 952(b), 953; Uniontown Area School Dist. Moreover, in the landmark\ndecision in desegregation law in Pennsylvania, Chester School Dist., the Supreme Court stated that:\n[T]he Legislature has specifically mandated in § 12 that `the provisions of this act shall be\nconstrued liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof.' In our view a more reasonable\nconstruction of the disputed phrase would be that where, as here, the responsible party has the\npower to take corrective measures, indeed of necessity it must redistrict periodically, its failure to\nact amounts to the continued withholding from most [Black] children the admitted advantages of\nan integrated education. Total nonaction by school boards is thus impossible and even seemingly\nneutral decisions frequently encourage de facto towards segregation. Such a construction, of\ncourse, does not mean that a totally integrated school system must be achieved overnight or that\n\n672 Chester need abandon neighborhood *672 schools but only that complete inaction under the\ncircumstances of this case amounts to a denial of these advantages.\nId.,427 Pa. at 165-66, 233 A.2d at 294-95.\nThe court also noted in Chester School Dist. that seemingly neutral decisions by school boards can and in fact\ndid in certain circumstances lead to de facto segregation 00 decisions such as where to build new school facilities,\n97\nthe size of schools, attendance boundaries or areas from which students are drawn, and methods used to relieve\novercrowding in its schools. There is no dispute that the Commission bases its complaint on de facto segregation\nin the Philadelphia schools, and even though no claim for de jure segregation was initiated, the School District\nnonetheless has a legal responsibility and duty to take steps to correct the condition, and its failure to do so\nconstitutes a violation of the Human Relations Act.\nDespite the Commission's continued concern for further integration of the School District's schools through\nmandatory measures, the Commission also recognizes that disparate educational opportunities must also be\naddressed, and emphasizes that an important element of any school desegregation case is to ensure that a\ndesegregation plan matches services with the educational needs of each school building. Mr. Richard B. Anliot,\nwho heads the Commission's desegregation unit, testified during the initial phase of this proceeding that in\ndeveloping the Commission's recommended elements of a school desegregation plan, he included this element\nto guarantee a more equitable outcome in terms of student achievement.\n*\nIntervenor ASPIRA has challenged the School District's performance under the 1983 modified plan and argued\nthat the District has failed to provide an equal and adequate education in the racially isolated minority schools,\nand that this failure is demonstrated by the provision of fewer resources including, among other things, less\nexperienced and less highly rated teachers, older school facilities requiring greater repair, fewer dollars spent on\n673 educational improvement in these schools, and limited opportunities for minority students to attend magnet *673\nschools. Noting that educators agree that the disparities in achievement between Minority and White students\ncan be corrected, and because the District has refused to go after additional funding for this purpose, ASPIRA\ncontends that the District has not taken all feasible measures to remedy the segregated and disparate\neducational opportunities within its public schools.\nAnalyzing the voluminous factual record, Intervenor-ASPIRA argues that racial disparities in educational\nopportunities are evident in every indicator used to measure the quality of the School District's schools, including\ninter alia, standardized tests, teacher subject-matter letter grades, and graduation rates. Other evidence of\ndisparity concerned the allocation of financial resources within the School District, and an examination of its\nbudgets over a ten-year period establishes that a significantly higher percentage of funds were used for magnet\nand other support programs in non-racially isolated schools and no evidence was offered to show additional\nallocation or reallocation of funds or other resources for educational improvement opportunities in the racially\nisolated schools.\nIntervenor ASPIRA also argues that evidence revealed that the School District's efforts at voluntary\ndesegregation have not achieved the goals proposed in its 1983 modified plan. Reviewing the requests for\ntransfers, ASPIRA maintains that a significant percentage of school transfer denials are to minority students and\nthat the School District's goal in the modified plan was to increase voluntary transfers to at least 14,000 per year\nwhich was not achieved. If the voluntary desegregation effort were ended as the School District urges, there\nwould be an increase in the already largely segregated status which currently exists within the School District.\n*\nIntervenor Lowell argues that the School District has not achieved maximum feasible desegregation because it\nhas not expanded the number of schools in integrated neighborhoods where there is overcrowding, but has\n674 instead bused students from integrated neighborhoods in violation of the 1983 modified *674 plan. Lowell argues\n\nthat although the modified plan provides that students in naturally desegregated schools should not be\nreassigned and the Commission recommended constructing new schools as a tool for desegregation, the School\nDistrict continues to bus students from integrated neighborhood schools due to overcrowding.\nFurther, overcrowded schools do not have available space for voluntary transfers which would further\ndesegregate schools, and busing to relieve overcrowding is not a cost effective solution to the problem. Lowell\nalso argues that the cost of voluntary busing under the desegregation program and mandatory busing to relieve\nschool overcrowding degrades the educational programs for all students because the money allocated for busing\ncannot be spent on school construction, building maintenance or instructional programs. As to a remedy, the\nCourt should focus on encouraging the School District to build schools where they are needed in racially\nintegrated neighborhoods.\n*\nThe School District, in its reply to the briefs filed by the Commission and Intervenors ASPIRA and Lowell,\nmaintains that the relevant time period for the Court's inquiry into the District's desegregation efforts is from 1983\nthrough 1987 and that the evidence presented demonstrates that the District has done all that could be done to\n675 accomplish the goals of the 1983 modified plan.[4] Noting the extensive statistical data in the *675 record, the\nDistrict contends that its definition of a desegregated school created considerably more schools in compliance\nwith the modified plan than was indicated by the Commission, and that any further mandatory desegregation\nmeasures would be counter-productive.\nMoreover, the School District believes that it performed a substantial portion of the educational components of\nthe 1983 modified plan including, inter alia, selection of program modules best suited for each school; adoption of\nmodules for the Priority One schools; a needs assessment survey for the replicating success schools;\nmaintenance of the replicating success program ultimately converted into the school-wide project; and program\nupgrades. As to its financial resources, the School District has maintained throughout this litigation that it has no\nadditional funds to allocate to any other programs for desegregation purposes; and it has not sought additional\nfunding from the City because it would be a futile act. The District also claims that restrictions are imposed upon it\nin the assignment of teaching staff because union contract provisions prohibit the placement of better qualified\nteachers where needed the most, and that dealing with societal conditions including, among others,\nhomelessness, lack of medical care, drug abuse, violence and teen pregnancies hamper the funding of programs\ndesigned to improve the achievement levels of students in racially isolated minority schools.\nIV.\nElements of the Plan\nThe School District designed the 1983 modified plan with three initiatives: the Educational Improvement Plan; the\nDesegregation Expansion Strategy; and the Effort to Reduce Racial Isolation. The first of these initiatives\n676 contained four *676 stated goals which were to assure equal educational opportunity and equal access to\nexcellence for all students within the School District regardless of the school attended; to provide educational\nofferings and specialized programs intended to attract a diverse student applicant pool; to reorganize educational\nofferings and effect a measurable improvement in student performance at the designated Priority One\neducational improvement schools; and to respond to the unique educational concerns of those students attending\nracially isolated schools. The School District recognized that to achieve excellence within the schools, there was\na need for each school to have clearly defined learning goals and guidelines for instruction and that high\nachievement expectations must prevail with emphasis on accepting responsibility for learning by staff and\nstudents.\nThe Desegregation Expansion Strategy encompassed components which were to continue policies to assure a\nracially balanced instructional staff at each school; identify and target schools to be moved toward desegregated\nstatus; establish a unit to provide technical assistance to schools and support to parents and students; implement\n\nenhanced sensitivity staff development training so that staff can effectively respond to needs of a diverse student\npopulation; and expand efforts to improve intergroup relations. The School District established two types of\ntransfers as a means to encourage and provide incentive for voluntary student transfers: EH-36 transfers are\navailable for students wishing to transfer between neighborhood schools and any other open enrollment school;\nand EH-38 transfers are available for those students seeking transfer to special admissions schools or programs.\nFree transportation is provided by direct bus service or bus tokens.\nThe Effort to Reduce Racial Isolation component focuses on racially isolated schools in which the student\npopulation is more than 90 percent Black, White, Hispanic or Asian. The School District's effort encompassed\naugmented curriculum offerings on multicultural understanding; reorganization and refocusing of shared-time\n677 activities; career development laboratory concept; and region-wide efforts to develop a program *677 for all\nchildren to meet and to interact. In racially isolated schools, the curriculum would be augmented by emphasizing\nunits of content within the social studies curriculum.\nThe plan provides that while desegregation is the goal, integration is the objective, and that desegregation should\nbe achieved so as to enhance the likelihood that integration will occur. The plan further sets forth the following\nguidelines:\nBecause integration is the long-term objective, schools and programs that are already stably\ndesegregated should be left substantially intact.\nBecause integration is the long-term objective, schools and programs that are marginally or\nrecently desegregated should be monitored, strengthened and left substantially intact.\nBecause integration is the long-term objective, patterns, trends and programs that have real\nlikelihood of leading naturally to desegregation should remain undisturbed.\nCommission Ex. 2, p. 57.\nV.\nFindings\n1. The Philadelphia School District's enrollment as of September 1992 was 201,400 students who attended\napproximately 250 schools within the District. The racial composition of the student population as of fall 1992 was\n126,492 or 62.8 percent Black; 20,669 or 10 percent Hispanic; 9,314 or 4.6 percent Asian; and 44,963 or 22.3\n[5]\npercent White.  For desegregation purposes, the School District's schools are identified as racially isolated\n678 (more than 90 percent minority or 90 *678 percent white); desegregated (25 to 60 percent white or 40 to 75\npercent minority); and remainder schools (75 to 90 percent minority or 60 to 90 percent white).\n2. As of 1992, there were 134 racially isolated minority schools comprising 107,327 students or 53 percent of the\nstudent population; two racially isolated white schools with 1,035 students or .05 percent of the student\npopulation; fifty-seven desegregated schools with 38,566 students or 19 percent of the student population; and\nforty-five remainder schools with 54,072 students or 27 percent of the student population. In racially isolated\nminority schools, over 90 percent of the student population is minority. As of December 1, 1992, School District\ndata show that 73.26 percent of the District's Black students were attending schools with over 90 percent minority\npopulation. In November, 1977, there were 113 such schools and 111 in 1980. HRC IV.\n3. School District estimates are that 76 percent of its students live below the poverty line and that the level of\npoverty in the racially isolated minority schools goes as high as 95-96 percent. The School District uses AFDC\n(Aid for Families With Dependent Children) eligibility as its measure of poverty.\n4. The School District is divided into seven administrative areas. Most of the White students are concentrated in\nwhat had been referred to as districts seven and eight (northeast), and 57 percent of White students attend\nschools in these districts. Over 98 percent of the students attending the 134 racially isolated schools are minority,\n\nand 73 percent of all Black students attend racially isolated schools with an enrollment of over 90 percent\nminority.\n5. The School District's city-wide achievement test data report the number and percentage of student test results\nby national percentile rank band on the CTB Macmillan/McGraw-Hill test organized by the students' race and\nethnicity. The percentile ranks reported annually were: below the 16th percentile or lowest achievement level,\n679 16th to 49th percentile, at/above 50th percentile, and above 84th percentile *679 or highest achievement level. In\n1992, the School District switched to the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills-4 and changed the reporting of its\ncity-wide achievement test data from percentiles to 1st or lowest quartile, 2nd quartile, 3rd quartile and 4th or\nhighest quartile.\n6. The School District's Priority One initiative expanded the educational improvement replicating success project\nimplemented in 1983 as part of the School District's 1983 modified plan. This initiative focused on low achieving\nelementary schools and sought improvement in the percentage of students scoring at or above the 50th\npercentile in the four major subjects on the spring city-wide testing; reduction in the proportion of students scoring\nbelow the 16th percentile in the four major subjects; increase in the percentage of students receiving report card\ngrades of A or B in reading, writing, math, science and social studies; and by 1991 students in those schools\nwere to show mastery of writing goals of the standardized curriculum so that 75 percent will attain a mark of A, B\nor C in the final report card.\n7. The Priority One goals are based on the assumptions that grade level performance is indicated by mastery of\n75 percent of the objectives on the city-wide testing program; a student's score of 75 percent will customarily\nscore at or above the 50th percentile in terms of national norms; and a letter grade of A, B or C indicates that a\nstudent is performing at or above grade level.\n8. City-wide 1990 results for students tested in reading from grades 1 through 8 showed that 7 percent of the\nWhite students scored below the 16th percentile compared to 15 percent for Black students; and 19 percent of\nthe White students scored above the 84th percentile compared to 7 percent for Black students. In math, 7\npercent of the White students tested below the 16th percentile compared to 15 percent for Black students; and 31\npercent scored above the 84th percentile compared to 13 percent for Black students.\n9. City-wide 1990 test results in reading/English/language arts show that the gap between White and Black\n680 students in *680 grades 1 through 8 who scored above the 50th percentile was 22 percent and by 1992 had\nexpanded to 24 percent; the gap between White and Hispanic students was 31 percent in 1990 and 30 percent in\n1992. Test results in math concepts and applications show a 23 percent gap between White and Black students\nin 1990 which expanded to 29 percent in 1992.\n10. In 1990, 58 percent of the White students tested from grades 1 through 8 in reading/English/language arts\nscored above the 50th percentile compared to 36 percent for Blacks and 27 percent for Hispanics or gaps of 22\nand 31 percent respectively. In 1991, 50 percent of the Whites scored above the 50th percentile compared to 37\npercent for Blacks and 28 percent for Hispanics or gaps of 13 and 22 percent respectively. In 1992, 47 percent of\nWhite students scored above the 50th percentile compared to 23 percent for Blacks and 17 percent for Hispanics\nor gaps of 24 and 30 percent respectively. In math concepts, the yearly percentages are higher for students\nscoring above the 50th percentile but the gaps between students by race widened.\n11. City-wide 1990 results for students tested in grades 8 through 12 in reading/English show that 7 percent of\nthe White students scored below the 16th national percentile compared to 19 percent for Black students; and 28\npercent scored above the 84th national percentile compared to 12 percent for Black students.\n12. For the period 1988 to 1991, city-wide test results for students in racially isolated and desegregated schools\ntested in reading showed 32 percent of students in racially isolated schools scored above the 50th percentile\ncompared to 52 percent for desegregated schools, and for each year through 1991, the gap averaged 20\npercentage points between students above the 50th percentile. In math, the city-wide test results showed an 18\npercent gap between students in racially isolated and desegregated schools scoring above the 50th percentile\nand that gap increased to 22 percent by 1991.\n\n13. City-wide 1992 test results for racially isolated schools show that in reading 4 percent of the students scored\n681 in the *681 highest quartile and 55 percent scored in the lowest quartile; in math, 6 percent of these students\nscored in the highest quartile and 54 percent in the lowest quartile. For desegregated schools, 15 percent of the\nstudents tested in reading scored in the highest quartile and 35 percent scored in the lowest quartile; in math, 19\npercent scored in the highest quartile and 33 percent in the lowest quartile.\n14. City-wide 1992 test data shows that 17 percent of students in the 134 racially isolated schools scored above\nthe national median in reading compared to 36 percent for students in desegregated schools. In math, 19 percent\nof the racially isolated schools scored above the 50th percentile compared to 40 percent for the desegregated\nschools.\n15. The TELLS test, an examination of public school students for minimum competency in reading and math, was\ndeveloped at the direction of the governor of Pennsylvania, and was given to third, fifth and eighth graders from\n1984 through the 1991. The Department of Education issued reports showing the percent of students who\nreached cut scores, or the state-established minimum level of acceptable performance in basic reading and math\nskills. The TELLS reading test results for the 1990-91 school year show that 55 percent of the Black students and\n63 percent of the Hispanic students tested scored below the cut score, compared to 29 percent for White\nstudents. In math, 50 percent of the Black students and 58.2 percent of the Hispanic students tested scored\nbelow the cut score compared to 26.5 percent for the White students.\n16. Significant disparities exist between students on letter-grade marks by subject and race. The 1990 baseline\ndata for performance indicators show that in English, 22.5 percent of the White students in grade 12 received A's\ncompared to 10.5 percent for Black students and 15.8 percent for Hispanic students; and 10.7 percent Black and\n11.2 percent Hispanic students received F's contrasted with 5.3 percent for Whites. In social studies, 21.7\npercent of the White students received A's compared to 10.5 percent for Black and 13.3 percent for Hispanic\n682 students; and 10.2 percent Black and 12 percent Hispanic students received F's compared to 5.2 percent for \n*682 Whites. The percentage of students receiving A's in math were 22.7 percent for Whites, 11.5 percent for\nBlacks and 14.7 percent for Hispanics; and 14.4 percent Blacks and 13.3 percent Hispanics received F's\ncompared to 8.2 percent for Whites. In science, 18.5 percent White students received A's compared to 7.7\npercent for Black and 12.2 percent for Hispanic students; and 11.2 percent Black and 12.2 percent Hispanics\nreceived F's compared to 6.5 percent for Whites.\n17. Analysis of the School District's city-wide summaries for elementary/middle school letter-grades show the\nsame disturbing pattern. Data for students tested in grades 1 through 8 in language arts show that 22.9 percent\nof the White students received A's compared to 10.8 percent for Blacks and 7.9 percent for Hispanic students,\nand at the bottom end, 11.6 percent Black and 15.3 percent Hispanic students received F's compared to 6.5\npercent for Whites. In reading, 32.7 percent of the White students received A's compared to 18.4 percent for\nBlack and 14.9 percent for Hispanic students; and 5.9 percent Black and 7.9 percent Hispanic students received\nF's compared to 3.8 percent for Whites. This pattern persists for elementary/middle school letter-grade data\npertaining to English, math, social studies and science.\n18. Data for advanced placement course opportunities from 1988 to 1992 show a substantial disparity: in\n1988-89, 4.8 percent of the White students were in advanced placement compared to .6 percent for Blacks and\n.8 percent for Hispanics; and in 1991-92, 5.4 percent of the White students were in advanced placement\ncompared to 1.4 percent for Blacks and .7 percent for Hispanics. As of June 1990, 4300 more Whites participated\nin the mentally gifted program than Blacks.\n19. Graduation rates further demonstrate achievement disparities: for 1991-92, 84 percent of the White seniors\nreceived their diplomas, and 73 percent of the Black seniors and 68 percent of the Hispanic seniors received their\ndiplomas. The gap in graduation rates between Black and White students ranged from 10 percent in 1986-87\n683 school year to 13 percent in 1988-89 and 11 percent in 1991-92; and for White and *683 Hispanic students, the\ngap ranged from 15 percent in 1986-87, 18 percent in 1988-89 and 16 percent in 1991-92.\n20. Expert testimony proved that although poverty is the most significant variable in explaining achievement\ndisparities, racial isolation of students has a statistically significant and independent effect on achievement\n\noutcomes. In 1990, the School District adopted a goal to reduce by ten percent over the next five years the\nachievement gaps between Black, Hispanic and White students and to increase during the same period, the\nnumber of Black and Hispanic students enrolled in advanced placement courses. The five-year goal was\ndeveloped to comply with the educational improvement component of the 1983 modified plan.\n21. Voluntary school transfer records show that approximately 18 percent of the 284,000 transfer requests\nsubmitted by Black students from 1985-93 were approved, and 33 percent of 66,200 transfer requests from White\nstudents were approved. From 1985-93, 10 percent of the EH-36 transfer requests were from White students and\n82 percent of these requests were from Black students. White students' EH-36 transfer requests have gone from\na high of 1,229 in 1987-88 to a low of 459 in 1992-93. The School District receives larger numbers of White\nstudent transfer requests for EH-38 special admissions.\n22. The desegregation office maintained an informal policy of reserving 50 percent of all spaces in the School\nDistrict's magnet program for White students although they comprise 22 percent of the student population,\nthereby reducing the number of Black and Hispanic students eligible for admission to those enriched learning\nprograms which maintain lower student-teacher ratios, better-qualified teachers and enhanced resources.\n23. The office of desegregation targeted 118 schools in 1983 for desegregation; the first group selected were\nthose already desegregated, according to the School District, and the remaining fifty schools were targeted for\n684 desegregation. As of 1992-93, not more than twenty-five of those schools have *684 been desegregated. The\nCommission's records show that under its definition of a non-segregated school, the number of desegregated\nschools increased by two, from thirty-eight to forty during the three-year implementation period of the 1983\nmodified plan; and by 1991, the number of desegregated schools had been reduced to thirty-five. The\nCommission's definition of a non-segregated school is one with at least 25 percent White enrollment and at least\n40 percent Black enrollment, or at least 20 percent Hispanic enrollment and at least 25 percent White and 25\npercent Black enrollment.\n24. A study of census tract records presented by a School District expert shows that the City of Philadelphia is\nresidentially segregated by race and is more segregated today than ever before, and census maps show a strong\ncorrelation between racial composition of neighborhoods and the racial composition of schools which are more\nsegregated today than they were in 1984 or 1985. Elementary school segregation is even higher for Hispanics\nbecause these schools are confined to Hispanic neighborhoods.\n25. Race is only considered by the School District in transfer requests to the 118 schools targeted for\ndesegregation under the 1983 modified plan. Only one-half of the thirty magnet school programs are either\ndesegregated or targeted for desegregation; and race is not considered for the remainder of schools where\nstudents request to transfer out of their neighborhood schools.\n26. The 1983 modified plan excluded from the desegregation expansion component the seventy-six Priority One\nschools, which later incorporated the School-wide project effort, and these excluded schools were predominantly\nracially isolated minority schools. School-wide projects are those schools in which 75 percent or more of the\nstudents come from families living below the poverty line, and they receive federal Chapter One funds for the\npurpose of improving overall school programs and to help students succeed on a daily basis in school.\n685 *685 27. The Priority One work plan for school improvement was developed in response to teachers' low\nexpectations of poor students, and staff development and training was required for the Priority One program to\nalter teacher expectations as to poor minority students. School District staff estimated that one-third of the\nteachers who volunteered for the Priority One training held low expectations of poor minority children.\n28. The least experienced teachers are employed in racially isolated minority schools which face the highest rate\nof teacher turnover; the best qualified of the newly hired teachers work in white or desegregated schools rather\nthan serve in racially isolated minority schools and the most experienced teachers generally work in the\nnorthwest or northeast areas. The racially isolated minority schools also experience fewer substitutes and the\nhighest percentage of non-certified substitutes. High teacher turnover in racially isolated minority schools has\nexisted within the School District for many years yet no system-wide mandates are in place to correct this\ncondition.\n\n29. The School District reported that certain of the School-wide projects have received national attention because\nof the success with particular programs: William Dick Elementary School created an eleven-month program and\nused extra time to ensure higher percentages of students mastering the curriculum and qualifying for promotion\nto the next grade; the Lingelbach School emphasized higher skills and integration of communication skills and the\narts; the Key School implemented the \"success for all\" model whereby students in the early grades are given\nindividualized tutoring daily where necessary to produce success.\n30. Students in racially isolated minority schools are required to attend the older and most physically deteriorated\nschool facilities within the School District which require the greatest amount of maintenance and repair; some of\nthe racially isolated minority schools also present security and safety problems which have not been ameliorated\nby the District and which hinder learning.\n686 *686 31. Due to budget cuts for the current year, the School District eliminated two full-day kindergarten\nprograms from desegregated schools and seven full-day kindergarten programs from racially isolated minority\nschools where the need was greatest. In the 1992-93 school year, the School District maintained full-day\nkindergarten classes in thirty-two of the fifty-seven desegregated schools and fifty-three in the racially isolated\nminority schools. Twenty percent of the first graders in the School District received no kindergarten or pre-school\nexperience.\n32. The School District's operating budget for the 1992-93 school year was $1.3 billion in round figures, and of\nthis amount a substantially low sum was allocated and spent on desegregation programs. The sum expended for\nthe Priority One educational improvement program in racially isolated minority schools was $2,316,622 or an\ninfinitesimal sum compared to the total annual operating budget. The District has made no attempt to secure\nadditional funding from the City of Philadelphia or Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for its educational\nimprovement initiatives in low achievement racially isolated minority schools, nor has it reallocated surplus funds\nto expand upon the academic initiatives in these schools.\n33. The School District's desegregation cost was $33,710,800 for 1991-92 and included $3,264,008 for Priority\nOne programs, or less than one percent of the total desegregation budget; and $2,316,622 for 1992-93, or two-\nthirds of one percent of the total desegregation budget of $34,606,208. During the same two-year period,\n$10,662,861 was spent on magnet school programs with an enrollment of 2,004 students.\n34. The School District's analysis of costs per pupil show that for the 1992-93 school year, $5,783 was spent per\npupil and this sum is expected to decline to $5,317 for the current year.\n35. Pupil cost analyses further show that for the four-year period from 1989-90 through 1992-93, the total\nexpenditures for non-public school students ranged from $38,247,370 to $36,546,663. For 1993-94, the School\n687 District's adopted budget for non-public school students is $38,149,967 which includes *687 $18 million for\ntransportation of students to private and parochial schools.\n36. Expenditures for the replicating success component of the Educational Improvement Plan ranged from a sum\nof $179,134 in 1983-84 to $818,715 in 1985-86. The replicating success project involved 26 of the successor\nPriority One racially isolated minority schools in a three-year effort to improve the educational potential of these\nschools by upgrading programs through replication and incorporation of instruction proven successful in similar\nsituations.\n37. The three most overcrowded schools in the northeast and central east region are Morrison, Olney and Lowell;\nLowell and Olney were considered by the School District to be desegregated and Morrison was considered to be\na multicultural school. Children from these schools are bused outside of their integrated neighborhoods to other\nlocations to reduce overcrowding. The School District has maintained overcrowded schools in integrated\nneighborhoods for more than a decade and has failed in prior years to consider new construction in these\nneighborhoods to promote the desegregation goals.\n38. In its 1988-92 contract with the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, the School District retained the authority\nto appoint experienced teachers to facilities with experience imbalance, to involuntarily transfer teachers in the\nfirst year of service to reduce racial or experience imbalance, and to prevent more than 10 percent of appointed\n\nteachers in a school from transferring therefrom in any year for any reason. The School District contracted away\nthis authority in its 1992-94 teachers' contract.\n39. In 1992-93, the School District employed 12,500 teachers.\nVI.\nDiscussion\n(a)\n688 Starting with the basic assumptions outlined in the School District's 1983 modified plan that \"[a]ll students can \n*688 learn regardless of race, ethnic background, or socio-economic level[;] [a]ll students have a right to expect\nthe same level of curricular content and quality of instruction regardless of school location [and] [a]ll students\nneed to know, understand, and apply the values of a multicultural, democratic society,\" the Court must and shall\nlook to student achievement results, among other things, to determine whether an equal educational opportunity\nhas been made available to all students within the public schools. School District 1983 Modified Plan,\nEducational Improvement Component, p. 23.\nIn Freeman, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1437, the Supreme Court stated that a \"[p]roper resolution of any\ndesegregation case turns on the careful assessment of its facts,\" and as to the School District's contention that\neducational opportunity and equality of education is irrelevant to this proceeding, the Court first directs the District\nto the express requirements of the Educational Improvement Component of its 1983 modified plan and as well, to\nthe plethora of federal and state court decisions which recognize that assessment of the equality of educational\nopportunity and quality of education is an appropriate inquiry by the Court in determining whether racial disparity\n[6]\nexists in the public school system under court decree.\nIn Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka (Brown I), 347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), the\n689 leading case which established a foundation for the dismantling of barriers *689 erected throughout this nation to\nequal educational access and opportunity, the U.S. Supreme Court cogently admonished that:\nToday, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.\nCompulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate\nour recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the\nperformance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the\nvery foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to\ncultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust\nnormally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be\nexpected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity,\nwhere the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on\nequal terms. (Emphasis added.)\nDespite the fact that the question presented in Brown I concerned the school district's maintenance of a dual\nschool system based solely on race, the court's statements are no less compelling or persuasive where as here\nthe question involves the effects of de facto segregation and whether equal educational opportunity in terms of a\nquality education is provided to minority students attending public schools.\nThe evidence adduced at trial unequivocally supports the contention of Intervenor ASPIRA and the Commission\nthat Black and Hispanic students lag behind White students in reading and math as measured by test results and\nin all other indicators utilized to assess academic achievement and that to a statistically significant degree, race is\na factor with regard to the levels of academic achievement even correlating for other variables such as poverty,\nbusing, school attendance rates or teacher/student turnover. Thus the parties have sustained their burden of\nshowing that race is a significant factor in the achievement gaps which continue to widen between the students.\n690 [7]*690 Intervenor Lowell presented evidence which sufficiently established that integrated schools in the central\n\neast and northeast regions of the School District are overcrowded and that the School District buses students\nfrom those schools despite provisions in the 1983 modified plan which require it to leave the population of\nintegrated schools undisturbed, and to subordinate pupil movement strategies and maintain \"educationally\ndefensible programs\" designed to respond to the needs and concerns of the integrated neighborhoods.\nAlthough some of the socio-economic conditions relied upon by the School District as a defense to its failure, or\nrefusal, to provide equal educational opportunity and quality education for all students within the system may in\nfact produce negative impacts upon some students' willingness or motivation to succeed in the classroom, the\nstark showing in this record of the disparities in educational achievement and opportunity represents substantial\nand sufficient evidence to satisfy the Commission and Intervenors' burden of proof.\n(b)\n[8]\nA summary of the extensive testimony offered by witnesses for the parties is presented hereafter.\n691 *691 Dr. Constance Clayton, Superintendent of Schools from October 1982 through August 1993, testified that all\nstudents can learn to the best of their potential as set forth in the School District's 1983 modified plan and that the\nPriority One initiative, plagued by teacher turnover in the schools, represented a part of the desegregation effort.\nDr. Clayton indicated that the oldest school facilities in the District, some constructed more than 100 years ago\nand requiring the greatest amount of repair, are concentrated predominantly in minority areas containing racially\nisolated minority schools; that upon commencement of her tenure, she found schools not painted in over twenty-\nfive years and generally poor maintenance conditions; and that security and school safety conditions are worse in\nthe racially isolated minority schools. As superintendent, she began a facilities improvement program, established\ngrade marking guidelines, made efforts to resolve the impact of teacher turnover in Priority One schools,\nexpanded the pre-school education program, and initiated other measures in an effort to satisfy the educational\ngoals of the School District. Under Dr. Clayton, approximately 21 million meals were served per year to students\nthrough the District's universal feeding program offered regardless of need.\nAccording to Dr. Ernestine Carter, Director of the Office of Desegregation since 1979, the School District\n692 maintains thirty *692 magnet programs 00 three full magnet schools created prior to implementation of the 1983\n97\nmodified plan (high school for engineering and science, high school for creative and performing arts and Bodine\nHigh School for international affairs); and the remainder are magnet programs within a school. Fifteen magnet\nprograms are either desegregated or targeted for desegregation and fifteen are non-desegregated and are not\ntargeted for desegregation. Dr. Carter testified that her office has maintained a 50/50 admissions policy for the\nmagnet schools which are desegregated or targeted for desegregation, preferring to maintain 50 percent of the\nseats available in the magnet programs for White students. Recognizing that the School District's population was\n22 percent White, Dr. Carter agreed that by maintaining the 50/50 admissions ratio, fewer seats were available\nfor minority students.\nNo new magnet high schools have been created since 1983 and the increase in the number of students who\ncould attend magnet high schools since that time has been approximately 1500. Dr. Carter concluded that the\nDistrict had been unsuccessful in attracting White students to transfer out of their neighborhoods under the\nEH-36 transfer policy although Black and Hispanic students participated in this transfer policy to a much greater\ndegree; however, the School District receives large numbers of White students who apply and are accepted into\nthe EH-38 special admissions or magnet programs.\nUsing the School District's definition of a desegregated school, Dr. Carter stated that as of the 1992-93 school\nyear, approximately twenty-five of the fifty schools targeted in 1983 were actually desegregated and admitted that\nbeginning with the 1987-88 school year, the number of schools considered by the District to be desegregated had\nin fact declined. Dr. Carter stated that furthermore, the 1983 modified plan did not address school pairings, school\nclosings, alteration of feeder patterns, or changing of grade structures as previously suggested by this Court or\nthe Commission. The School District did however make use of linkages for schools which were overcrowded and\n693 her office identified space in schools where *693 desegregation opportunities existed for youngsters attending\n\novercrowded schools. Efforts to resolve overcrowding have been limited to expansion of existing facilities such as\nportables and annexes and busing children from overcrowded schools to other locations.\nThe last school closings occurred approximately ten years ago prior to implementation of the 1983 modified plan;\nand since 1979, the School District has only opened Edison High School and a remedial disciplinary school in\nWest Philadelphia which were not part of the desegregation program. As for new school construction, Dr. Carter's\noffice has made no recommendations directly to the superintendent concerning additional new facilities which\nwould increase desegregation opportunities. Moreover, the desegregation office has submitted no proposals to\nthe School District to establish new magnet schools using School District operating or capital funds. Her office's\nbudget for this year is approximately $15 million ($1 million from the state and $3.4 million from a federal grant)\nand $500,000 or little more than three per cent of her office's budget is devoted to the School District's efforts to\nreduce racial isolation among students in the racially isolated minority schools.\nDr. Harris testified that poor and minority urban schools can become effective schools (where achievement levels\nare high enough to demonstrate acceptable mastery of the curriculum), and that there are in fact poor racially\nisolated minority schools in Philadelphia where students are achieving. His philosophy is that if one school exists\nwhere Black and poor youngsters can learn, then other Black and poor schools can accomplish the same thing,\nciting the successes at Dick School where students increased their math scores from 1988 to 1991 by 19.8\npercent. To improve the achievement levels, there must be a change in the \"culture\" of racially isolated minority\nschools where successful teachers are rewarded and non-successful teachers penalized; and that staff must\nhave higher expectations of these students if they are to achieve.\nFurther observations of Dr. Harris were that if a teacher believes that a child cannot learn in a segregated\n694 environment, *694 then the teaching staff becomes impotent to teach; if the School District believes that these\nchildren cannot learn because they come from single-parent homes, then the system is impotent to produce\nresults; and if the School District believes that these children cannot learn because they are poor, then they are\nwritten off because the District defends its failures on the false assumptions that only additional funding can\n[9]\nimprove the quality of these children 00 an assumption also rejected by other experts in the field.  Dr. Harris'\n97\ntestimony concerning teacher expectations and school culture was repeatedly bolstered by witnesses for the\nSchool District and to that extent was found by the Court to be credible and persuasive. Moreover, Dr. Harris\naccurately depicted the School District's five-year goal to reduce academic achievement gaps by 10 percent as\nlow-level expectations of minority students.\nDr. Madden analyzed whether after controlling for the effects of poverty, the fact that a school was racially\nisolated had an independent and separate effect on the outcome of achievement scores in reading and math. Dr.\nYancey conducted his study to determine to what degree concentrations of minority populations of students in\nschools is important in affecting levels of achievement in racially isolated schools, using multiple regression\nequations with a series of variables 00 poverty, attendance rates, student turnover rates and busing. It was his\n97\nconclusion that after controlling for the effects of poverty and school climate, the impact of race is substantially\nsmaller than the effects of poverty and school climate.\nDr. Madden studied data on reading and math test scores of students in racially isolated minority schools and in\n695 the remainder *695 schools and found that although poverty was the most significant variable in explaining\nachievement differentials, racial isolation within the schools presented a statistically significant and independent\nvariable affecting the achievement levels of students. It was her opinion that the standard way to determine\nwhether racially isolated schools are different from remainder schools is by looking at the statistical significance\nof her findings, that is, after controlling for all other important influences, does racial isolation matter or \"how stark\nis the result.\" Dr. Madden concluded that by all statistical standards, race does apply and the fact still remains\nthat racially isolated schools are achieving at lower levels. Because of this fact, Dr. Madden opined that there is\nsomething in the environment of these schools which results in their lower achievement levels. Her studies\nrevealed that the statistical significance was quite high for reading: the odds are 98 percent that reading scores\nwill be lower in the School District's racially isolated schools than in the remainder schools and 99.97 percent\nprobability that math scores will be lower.\n\nAlthough Dr. Yancey did not testify about the statistical significance of racial differences, the studies conducted by\nboth experts arrive at the same conclusion albeit with differing quantitative impact upon achievement in racially\nisolated schools. Both experts used as a measurement of achievement the proportion of students scoring above\nand below the national median on achievement tests and the same types of poverty figures, but Dr. Yancey used\nschools with over 70 percent Black and Hispanic enrollment rather than the School District's definition of a\nracially isolated school used by Dr. Madden. The Court however found Dr. Madden's testimony to be more\npersuasive as her studies included more current data, included test scores for both reading and math as opposed\nto restricting the study to reading as Dr. Yancey did, and did not include controls such as attendance or busing\nwhich admittedly the School District can effect. Dr. Yancey controlled for attendance in spite of his testimony that\n696 students attending racially isolated minority schools have the *696 highest percentage of attendance in the city.\nMoreover, while the experts disagreed on the significance or validity of the scatter plots used by Dr. Yancey to\nanalyze his data, they agreed that teacher attitude may account for additional unexplained variances in\nperformance and achievement between students.\nDr. Harold Hodgkinson testified that class income is most important as a predictor of achievement and studies\nshow that early preschool education enhances a child's achievement potential in school. Reviewing the history of\nHead Start, he opined that any urban area which incorporates the Head Start program into the educational\n[10]\nprocess will benefit significantly.  Dr. Hodgkinson expressed an opinion which the Court emphatically\nembraces: \"prevention is a low-cost, effective strategy. Cure is very long term, very ineffective, and basically\ncosts a very large amount of money.\" N.T., p. 5784. Thus by applying a general principle of educational institutes\nthat the best resources should be placed in the earlier years to ensure success, the School District will receive\nthe best return on its investment. Dr. Cooley similarly opined that if staff were deployed in the context of programs\nfound to be successful in high poverty schools, there is a good chance of making a difference. The inference\ndrawn from his work is that staff is not deployed to provide more professional staff in high poverty schools.\nTeacher expectations also impact upon student achievement, and if new teaching strategies can be developed,\nDr. Hodgkinson believes that a large number of the children in racially isolated minority schools can succeed. It is\n697 well established in *697 education that students are highly impressionable and responsive to the expectations\nand attitudes of their teachers and that anticipation by teachers of low-achievement levels for their students can\nbecome a self-fulfilling prophecy according to experts in the field. Studies have shown the correlation between\nteacher expectations and achievement and that speeding up the instruction to children from low-income\n[11]\nbackgrounds had spectacular success.\nSchool principals Roberta Kimmelman and Karen Scholnick testified that although 98 percent of more of their\nelementary school students are minority and poor, their schools have experienced significant improvements in\nachievement due to programs initiated by them which, in some instances, did not require additional financial\nresources. Rhoads School, the first to develop an educational improvement plan, was nominated by the City as\nan exemplary school because of consistent increases in achievement since its participation in the school-wide\nproject. Ms. Kimmelman testified that although discipline issues absorb a significant amount of her time and she\nis introducing conflict mediation as a tool to resolve disciplinary problems, she managed to change her school's\nclimate in spite of the inability to pick the teachers she wanted or to remove non-performing teachers, or the\nSchool District's financial problems. She maintains a quality school because of initiatives which have changed the\nself-esteem of her students and teachers whose expectations of their students have been positively transformed.\n698 Ms. Scholnick reiterated that changing teacher expectations as to poor and minority students is *698 the most\nimportant step in increasing achievement levels in the racially isolated minority schools, creating a positive spiral\neffect. Moreover, staff development and professional training can assist teachers who have low expectations of\npoor children. This training however is voluntary and no formal system-wide training is in effect.\nAmy Zowniriw testified for Intervenor Lowell that she is the corresponding secretary for the home and school\nassociation at Lowell Elementary School and Academy for the Middle Years (AMY Northwest), a board member\nof Parents Union for Better Schools, and a founding member of Olney-Oaklane-Feltonville Parents for Better\nSchools. She stated that the Olney-Feltonville neighborhood consists of Black, Hispanic, Asian and Whites\nstudents and that children are bused from that area to various schools in the northeast region because the\n[12]\nneighborhood schools are overcrowded.  Eileen Bowles, a reading teacher at Lowell elementary school,\n\ntestified that the normal capacity for the school is 706 students but that during the 1992-93 year there were 951\nstudents at Lowell and that the student body was 36 percent Asian, 26 percent White, 21 percent Black, and 15\npercent Spanish. She stated that Lowell buses approximately 350 students to other schools on between twelve to\nfifteen buses and that in addition to busing the students the School District has provided off-site and portable\nclassrooms.\nDr. Judith Goode echoed the sentiments set forth in the 1983 modified plan supporting and encouraging\nneighborhood schools in integrated areas. From 1988 to 1990, Dr. Goode studied the effect of new immigration\n699 on intergroup relations *699 at the Morrison and Elkin elementary schools and examined the degree to which\nthere were boundaries based on race, ethnicity or class within the schools. The Morrison school was 28 percent\nWhite, 22 percent Black, 30 percent Latino and 20 percent Asian; and the Elkin school was 55 percent White, 13\npercent Black, 31 percent Latino, and 1 percent Asian. Dr. Goode concluded that the more residentially integrated\nthe neighborhood, the more children are able to play in a \"free, unfettered way\" and the better relations are within\nthe school. She also observed that the children were key to increasing intergroup relations among adults and\nwere able to break down barriers between adult groups.\nIrvin R. Davis, managing director of the school district, testified that as the administrator in charge of facilities, it is\nhis responsibility to respond to requests for additional space; and admitted that although he has the capacity to\nfund and is looking into the need for additional schools based on enrollment, he has never discussed with Dr.\nClayton or anyone else the idea of building additional classroom space or additional schools in residentially\nintegrated neighborhoods which have overcrowded schools to further the desegregation effort. In addition, Dr.\nClayton recalled discussions about the leasing, extending and purchase of facilities to deal with the issue of\novercrowding but stated that the School District had not adopted a policy requiring any such facilities to be\nopened as desegregated schools.\n(c)\nIn Swann, the court stated that equity jurisdiction confers upon a court the power to do equity and to fashion a\ndecree deemed necessary under the facts of a particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished\nequity jurisdiction. Although numerous desegregation cases have been decided by the courts, the Swann court\nnoted that there is no universal answer to the complex problem of desegregation. Each case must be examined\nin light of its present circumstances and available options. Moreover, in Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka (Brown\n700 II), 978 F.2d 585 (1992),cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct. 2994, 125 L.Ed.2d 688 (1993), the Court of *700\nAppeals reversed the district court's decision to end judicial supervision over certain aspects of Topeka's\ndesegregation plan, indicating that Dowell does not represent the Supreme Court's retreat from the principle that\n[13]\nthe measure of any desegregation plan is in its effectiveness.\nA case before the court in United States v. City of Yonkers, 833 F.Supp. 214 (S.D.N.Y.1993), raised many of the\nchallenges presented here. The question confronted was whether vestiges of segregation remained in the\nYonkers public school system which although capable of remedy were not being adequately addressed and as a\nconsequence, the school system continued to discriminate against Black and Hispanic students. In finding that\nthe principal factor found to be of paramount importance was the disparity in achievement levels between\nmajority and minority students as measured by standardized test scores, the court concluded that where\nevidence demonstrates that children are not learning at acceptable levels, \"all else pales in significance.\" Id. at\n220.\nThe record in the case sub judice clearly demonstrates that the educational needs of students in racially isolated\nminority schools substantially exceed those of other students. The test scores, graduation and dropout rates in\nthese schools are testimony both to the schools' failure and to their students' needs. Educators along with courts\nrecognize that the education of the urban poor is an important problem, and conventional wisdom demonstrates\n701 that standard techniques are ineffective to address this problem. Educators and experts in the *701 field,\nincluding Dr. Clayton, advocate an educational program which offers these children special assistance and\nindividual attention; an intensive pre-school and all-day kindergarten enrichment programs to reverse the\neducational disadvantages these children start out with; intensive involvement of parents in the schools and in\n\ntheir children's education; incentives to teachers who offer to work in racially isolated minority schools; extended\nschool year or required summer school enrollment; and most importantly, a greater alliance among local boards,\nadministrators, teachers' organizations, local and state governmental bodies and the community at-large for the\nbenefit of these children if they are to succeed.\nThe record firmly establishes that the School District is failing or refusing to provide an equal educational\nopportunity and a quality education to children attending racially isolated minority schools. An assessment of the\nSchool District's progress under the 1983 modified plan shows that some successes have been achieved,\nparticularly when one evaluates the laudable progress of many Priority One schools and other initiatives by\nSchool District employees obviously committed and dedicated to the success of all children, but the overall\nimplementation has been ineffective. This fact is made more evident when viewed in the context of testimony by\nSchool District professional staff and expert witnesses that all available measures or strategies have either not\nbeen considered or implemented by the School District which could enhance integration of its students and\neliminate the racial disparities in achievements.\nSome of those measures include, among many others, expansion of the magnet school program concept which\nthe School District recognized in its 1983 modified plan was unusually effective in achieving desegregation;\nmandated system-wide teacher training and professional development particularly as to teaching strategies in\nlow-achievement and poor schools; new school construction in naturally integrated neighborhoods to combat\novercrowding while simultaneously preserving integrated schools; new school construction to equalize facilities\n702 and to offer additional desegregation opportunities; *702 alteration of school feeder patterns or grade structures;\nmaintaining and increasing the number of naturally integrated neighborhood schools; and replicating programs\nfound to be successful at racially isolated schools such as Rhoads, Meade and Dick which created an eleven-\nmonth program to increase student achievement levels.\nOther measures include solicitation of additional funding from local and state taxing authorities for desegregation\npurposes; increasing the level of EH-36 transfers from White students for desegregation purposes; development\nof strategies to improve student attendance rates; institution of system-wide disciplinary and conflict resolution\npolicies to improve disciplinary problems within the schools; employment of retired and experienced school\nteachers to teach in racially isolated minority schools; reallocation of financial resources to equalize resources in\nthose schools where need is the greatest; initiation of expanded preschool programs and full-day kindergartens;\nassignment of staff based upon the needs of the children and their schools; regular assessment of the\ndesegregation office's accomplishments of the School District's goals and institution of accountability standards\nfor that office; and most of all revisiting the School District's own expectations and goals for the success and\nacademic achievements of students enrolled in the racially isolated minority schools.\nDespite the multiplicity of feasible and workable strategies available to the School District to further desegregate\nthe schools and to eliminate the racial disparities in student achievement, the District, among other things,\npermitted a disproportionate reduction in full-day kindergarten programs in the racially isolated minority schools\nwhere these programs were needed most; agreed in 1992 with the teachers' union to give up the School District's\nauthority to assign teachers based on the needs of students and their schools and to prevent the negative impact\nof high teacher turnover; maintained racially imbalanced admissions policies for the magnet and other special\nadmissions programs; allocated to personnel costs and fringe benefits essentially 100 percent of the Priority One\n703 budget for racially isolated schools rather than reallocations *703 for computer equipment, libraries, and other\nlearning tools sorely needed in the low-achieving schools; eliminated all but one of the truant officer positions\nfrom the current budget while simultaneously defending the School District's failures in part on school dropout\nand truancy problems; and generally failing to heed the advice of its educators and professionals who advocate\nfor expanded resources and efforts to improve the quality of education in racially isolated schools.\nOn the other hand, the Court is cognizant of the myriad social conditions which many urban school districts face\nand shall take notice of the escalating crime rates nationwide among youth; government's failure to eradicate the\nproliferation of drugs and illegal weapons within its cities; and most important, the lack of many parents to heed\nthe advice of experts in the field concerning the desperate need for the involvement of parents in the education of\ntheir children. Nevertheless, the School District cannot escape its obligations to provide an equal educational\nopportunity to all of its children by placing the failures of parents or society on these childrens' shoulders. Unless\n\nsomething is done to correct the deficiencies, the impacts on their lives will deepen; and the impact upon the city,\nits economy and well-being is evident.\nEqually important is that all children learn to live and function in a multicultural society, and this training can be\nachieved only through exposure in an integrated environment. Concerned with the detrimental effects of\nmaintaining a segregated school system, the court in Chester School Dist. quoted a wise educator within the\nschool system:\nStudents are a product of the learning experience which are provided for them, their experience of\ninteracting with people of various backgrounds socially, economically and culturally. Just as you\ndon't learn to swim by just looking at a swimming pool and without ever getting into it, you don't\nlearn to understand people unless you associate with them. Learning is not confined to just the\ndirection which is given to four walls of a classroom. Children learn through their association with\n704 each other in the cafeteria, eating lunch together. They learn through going on class *704 trips\ntogether, journeys and educational excursions. They learn in the way in which they appreciate\nprograms. They learn in the way in which they work together on committees in preparing class\nprojects. And there is no way that a teacher, no matter how excellent she is, there is no way that\nhe or she can give a child this experience.\nId.427 Pa. at 176, 233 A.2d at 300.\nThe School District established the policy that desegregation is a goal and integration is the objective. It now\nadvocates the contrary view and argues that race-conscious student assignments should be prohibited which will\nundoubtedly reverse the voluntary desegregation gains made to date, albeit insufficient. Children of all races\nmust and should learn to exist in a multicultural society and to respect their cultural differences. Perhaps through\nan integrated educational environment, future generations will no longer be plagued by racial intolerance and\nindifference and the consequent loss of spirit and resources, but will instead enjoy a society where people no\nlonger judge one another by the color of their skin or ethnic background.\n(d)\nThe 1983 modified plan concludes with a statement by Dr. Clayton:\n[I]t is imperative that we turn our attention from litigating to educating 00 that we are allowed to\n97\ndevote our energy and resources and talent to the urgent tasks that now confront all urban school\nsystems. . . . What parents with children in public schools want most for their children is quality\neducation in a safe school environment. That is also what they have a right to expect. In the final\nanalysis, charts and edicts cannot ordain desegregation. . . . Desegregation is not buses but\npeople. Its success is determined in the keener insight of a learner, the deeper sensitivity of a\nteacher, the wider vision of a community. All else is facade.\nId. at 63, 69-70. The School District must and shall provide the quality education which all children within its\nschools have a right to expect.\n705 *705 The Court concludes that the School District has failed to desegregate the public schools by all feasible\nmeans and continues to maintain a racially segregated school environment where all of the students do not\nreceive equal educational opportunities or a quality education mandated by the laws of this Commonwealth. In\n1954, the highest court in this nation ruled that where the state undertakes to provide the opportunity for an\neducation, it is a right which must be made available to all students, Black and White, on equal terms. To the\ndetriment of Black and Hispanic students, this right has not been made available on equal terms to all of the\nstudents in Philadelphia's public schools.\nThe record amply demonstrates that the School District has not provided to Black and Hispanic students equal\naccess to, among other things, the best qualified and most experienced teachers, equal physical facilities and\nplants, equal access to advanced or special admissions academic course offerings, equal allocation of resources,\nor a commitment to eliminating racial imbalances in the schools to the extent feasible. Consequently, the\n\nCommission's petition to enforce the law is granted. Counsel will be required to appear before the Court to review\nthe process for the appointment by the Court forthwith of a master or team of educational experts to develop a\ndesegregation plan which, after consideration of public viewpoints, effectively complies with the law.\nThe plan shall incorporate specific and reasonable academic achievement goals for students in racially isolated\nminority schools, programs or strategies designed to meet the achievement goals, expansion and/or institution of\npre-school and fullday kindergarten programs, recommendations for expansion of the school day and/or school\nyear, recommendations for incentives to attract a greater percentage of experienced and better qualified teachers\nto work in the racially isolated minority schools, expansion of magnet and special admissions programs,\nexpansion of the voluntary movement of students for desegregation purposes, recommendations for resolving\novercrowded conditions and increasing the number of schools in integrated neighborhoods, steps to combat\n706 school security and *706 safety problems, new strategies to encourage non-participating parents to become\ninvolved in the education of their children, and cost projections. The plan shall incorporate all other feasible and\nworkable goals and strategies aimed at remedying the racial disparities in educational opportunities and student\nachievement and further enhancing voluntary desegregation of the Philadelphia public schools. The plan shall\nalso contain timetables for implementation.\nORDER\nAND NOW this 4th day of February, 1994, having granted the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission's\npetition for enforcement of its final order and the April 15, 1983 order of this Court, Counsel are hereby directed to\nappear for conference in this case on Thursday, February 17, 1994 at 10:00 a.m., Commonwealth Court\nCourtroom One, Widener Building, Philadelphia, to discuss the process for development of a desegregation plan\nand timetable for implementation consistent with the foregoing opinion.\n[1] Intervenors Olney-Oaklane-Feltonville Parents for Better Schools, Lowell Home and School Association,\nFinletter Home and School Association (Lowell); Coalition of Concerned Citizens for Quality Education (Coalition\nof Concerned Citizens); and ASPIRA of Pennsylvania, Citizens Committee on Public Education in Philadelphia,\nFellowship Commission, Parents Union for Public Schools, Philadelphia Association of School Administrators,\nand Philadelphia Home and School Council (ASPIRA).\n[2] De facto segregation has been defined in varying ways; however, the court in Chester School Dist., and in \nHRC IV, reiterated an often used definition that the condition includes racial imbalance in schools which develops\nwhen the Black population becomes so great that drawing school zone boundaries geographically causes a great\nmajority of Black children to attend schools overwhelmingly Black. De jure segregation has been defined as the\nunconstitutional segregation by the state, or school district, of school students on the basis of race or the\nmaintenance of a dual school system. Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka (Brown I), 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98\nL.Ed. 873 (1954). The court in Chester School Dist. also stated that a lack of funds is not a defense to\nmaintaining a de facto segregated school system.\n[3] The Commission has contended in its brief that Intervenor Coalition for Concerned Citizen's petition for relief\nchallenging race-conscious assignments should be denied as it is beyond the scope of the Coalition's petition for\nintervention and for which intervention status was granted. While the Commission's contention raises some merit,\nthe Court permitted the petition for relief as it contained a challenge which mirrored claims asserted by the School\nDistrict and may arguably be subsumed in the petition for intervention. Nonetheless, this question is moot in view\nof the Court's suppression of Intervenor's untimely filed brief and the rulings in this matter.\n[4] The School District raised a continuing objection at trial to the introduction of evidence related to any period\nbeyond 1987 because the implementation period for the 1983 modified plan lasted for the three-year period only,\nand it is therefore the relevant period during which the District's actions may be evaluated. The District's\nobjections were overruled by the Court because of the impossibility of assessing and evaluating the District's\ncompliance with terms of the 1983 modified plan without reviewing its actions to the present time and moreover,\nthe District has offered no legal authority for its objections. In Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka (Brown II), 978\nF.2d 585 (10th Cir.1992),cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct. 2994, 125 L.Ed.2d 688 (1993), the court accepted\n\nthe view that the district court cannot evaluate a school district's compliance efforts without examining the school\ndistrict's good faith commitment to the \"whole\" of the court's desegregation decree, and following the dictates of \nFreeman, current conditions must be viewed to determine if a school district has discharged its duty across time. \nSee also Green v. County School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968)\n(desegregation plan adopted by the school district requires evaluation in practice). Recognition of the\nrequirement for evaluation of the School District's actions to the present time is further illustrated by the District's\nassertions that it continues to implement the modified plan and that it is currently in effect. School District's Brief,\np. 9.\n[5] In 1992, there were 46,609 White students attending parochial schools; in 1980, 68,904 White students\nattended parochial schools and 64,500 attended public schools; and in 1970, 88,542 White students attended\nparochial schools and 101,784 attended public schools. When the 1983 modified plan was implemented, White\nstudents represented 25.8 percent of the population and by 1987, they represented 23.8 percent of student\nenrollment. \nPublic school enrollment at varying times was as follows: 1970 00 279,847; 1980 00 224,339; 1990 00 190,978;\n97 97 97\n1992 00 201,496; and 1993 00 207,000.\n97 97\n[6]See e.g. Freeman (approved district court's consideration of differences in equality of education as measured\nby achievements of minority students); Swann (equity jurisdiction confers power to do equity and to fashion\ndecree deemed necessary under facts of the case); United States v. City of Yonkers, 833 F.Supp. 214\n(S.D.N.Y.1993) (factors relied upon in finding discrimination against Black and Hispanic students included\ndisparity between majority and minority students in achievement levels); HRC II (School District desegregation\nplan must include educational content as well as plans for eliminating racial imbalances); Sheff (educational\nopportunity is not limited to expenditure per pupil but also requires specific substantive level of education); Bd. of\nEduc. of Englewood Cliffs (reiterated state's long-standing philosophy that sound educational and legal principles\ndo not permit segregation with its inherent inequality in educational opportunities); and Abbott (court considered\nsufficiency of education to enable Black and Hispanic students to assume proper roles in society).\n[7] The Commission and Intervenor ASPIRA have argued that the burden of proof in this matter is on the School\nDistrict to prove its compliance with the court's order. The Court however ruled previously that the Commission\nand Intervenors had the burden in this enforcement proceeding to demonstrate that the School District has failed\nto further desegregate its schools in accordance with the 1983 Modified Plan because the Commission agreed to\nimplementation of the plan, to evaluate the District's progress under the plan, and to thereafter determine\nwhether to proceed with enforcement of this Court's April 15, 1982 desegregation order. \nPlacing the burden on the Commission and Intervenors in this action by no means implies that the Commission\nor the Intervenors must produce evidence of an alternative plan or other specific measures which the School\nDistrict should have assumed to cure its de facto segregative school system. Chester School Dist.\n[8] The expert witnesses who testified for Intervenor ASPIRA were Dr. J. Jerome Harris, educator and former\nSuperintendent for the Atlanta school district, qualified as expert in school improvement and increasing\nachievement in poor and minority schools, N.T. pp. 2758-2883, 3243-3426; and Dr. Janice Fanning Madden,\neconomist and Viceprovost/University of Pennsylvania, qualified as expert in statistical analysis and relationship\nbetween race and various outcomes in testing, N.T. pp. 3429-3561, 6090-6186, 6252-6395; for Intervenor Lowell\nwas Dr. Judith Goode, social and cultural anthropologist and Temple University Professor, qualified as expert in\ncontrasting intergroup relations and how they affect particular schools, N.T. pp. 3566-3652; and witnesses for the\nSchool District were Dr. William Yancey, sociologist and Temple University Professor, qualified as expert in\ndemographic characteristics of health in the City and in School District's specific problems, N.T. pp. 4266-4533;\nDr. William W. Cooley, scientist and University of Pittsburgh Professor, qualified as expert in school district\nfinancing and relationship between such financing and state and other agencies, and taxing and how taxing\nauthority relates to funding of districts in Pennsylvania, N.T. pp. 5534-5645; and Dr. Harold Hodgkinson, Director,\nCenter for Demographic Policy, qualified as expert in factors affecting student achievement, relationship between\npoverty and test scores, demographics, and consultation to national school boards, cities and districts on\nremedies in place or offered in other cities, N.T. pp. 5652-5904.\n\n[9] In the dissenting opinion in Dowell, Justice Thurgood Marshall commented upon the school board's actions\nand its intransigence in developing a meaningful plan to remedy discrimination and remarked that \"[b]ecause of\nthe relative indifference of school boards toward all-Afro-American schools, many of these schools continue to\nsuffer from high student-faculty ratios, lower quality teachers, inferior facilities and physical conditions, and lower\nquality course offerings and extracurricular programs.\" Id.,498 U.S. at 260 n. 5, 111 S.Ct. at 643 n. 5 (references\nomitted).\n[10] Dr. Hodgkinson recounted the results of a study conducted of Head Start children, now twenty-three years of\nage, which showed that those children at age twenty-one compared to the control group at the same age in terms\nof employment, high school graduation, college, and arrest records, have a greater percentage of success in life.\nBecause the average cost is $20,000 per year to maintain a prisoner, while the School District spent $5,783 per\npupil for 1992-93 expected to decline to $5,317 for the current year, and studies show that 72 percent of\nAmerica's prisoners are high school dropouts, Dr. Hodgkinson cautions that school districts must place the\nnecessary resources at an early age to prevent future problems to students and society caused by a lack of\neducation.\n[11] Dr. Hodgkinson recalled a Milwaukee study of teacher expectations which demonstrated a definite\ncorrelation between expectations and student achievement. Teachers predicted that certain children in their\nclasses would end up in jail, and because of those expectations teachers would make sure that this eventuality\noccurred by ignoring those students in class and not valuing their participation. Another example of the impact of\nteacher expectations was described by him and Dr. Yancey concerning an important study where teachers were\ngiven random and false test scores for their students. Certain of these students who reportedly tested high on\nintelligence turned out much improved performance because of the teachers' new image of the students and\ngreater attention paid to them which reinforced classroom learning.\n[12] Lowell presented a letter dated December 6, 1991 from Ellen Linky, regional superintendent of the office of\ncurriculum and instructional support, which indicates that the three most overcrowded schools in the Northeast\nRegion are Morrison, Olney Elementary and Lowell; and that in 1991, Morrison bused to other schools between\ntwelve and sixty children per bus on twenty five buses, Olney Elementary bused between six and twenty five\nchildren per bus on seven buses, and Lowell bused between six and twenty children per bus on four buses. In\naddition, as of June 1991, Lowell and Olney Elementary were considered stably desegregated schools, and\nMorrison was considered a multicultural school.\n[13] In his dissent in Dowell, Justice Marshall stated his agreement with the majority that the proper standard for\ndetermining whether a school desegregation decree should be dissolved is whether purposes of the\ndesegregation litigation have been fully achieved but expressed concern over the majority's failure to directly\nconfront the possibility of a reemergence of racially identifiable schools, stating that Swann establishes that if\nfurther desegregation is reasonable, feasible and workable, then it must be undertaken. The fact that litigation\nmay have been protracted is no reason for a court's dissolution of a desegregation decree where a school district\ncould have eliminated discrimination had the district taken available steps in early stages of the proceedings to\npromote desegregation and \"shaping\" (rather than following) public attitudes toward its schools.

      "text": "784 A.2d 266 (2001)\nPennsylvania HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION, Petitioner,\nv.\nSCHOOL DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA, Respondent.\nASPIRA of Pennsylvania, Intervenors.\nCommonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.\nHeard September 17, 2001.\nDecided September 28, 2001.\n267 *267 Michael Hardiman, Philadelphia, for petitioner.\nLynn Rosner Rauch, Philadelphia, for respondent.\nMichael Churchill, Philadelphia, for intervenors, ASPIRA of Pa.\nSMITH, Judge.\nIn May 1999 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court remanded the above-captioned school desegregation case to this\n[1]\nCourt to proceed with the enforcement of its 1994 Remedial Order.  The Remedial Order required the School\nDistrict of Philadelphia (School District) to undertake action to remedy the historical discrimination found to exist\nagainst Black and Hispanic children attending racially isolated public schools and to provide them with an equal\neducational opportunity. See Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia (HRC\n[2]\nVII), 168 Pa.Cmwlth.542, 651 A.2d 186 (1994).  In its Remedial Order, the Court incorporated \"the student,\nparent, teacher and principal as central participants in the educational reform effort, high academic standards and\nelimination of racial disparities in academic achievement as the primary missions, and rigorous curriculum\nframework as its core.\" Id. at 188-189.\nI.\na. Background\nIn July 1999, at the request of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, the Court convened the first of\nmany court conferences which continued up to August 2001 to review the School District's compliance with\n268 various components of the Remedial Order.[3] The Court resumed the *268 efforts it began prior to July 1996 to\nenforce, inter alia, the School District's development of a Comprehensive School Safety and Security Plan to\nreduce violence and disruption in the schools so as to promote student learning and the development of a\nsystem-wide Curriculum Plan to guide the School District in its instructional activities while it endeavored to\nimprove student academic achievement and to provide an equal educational opportunity to students in the\nracially isolated schools. Enforcement activity also centered around strategies to encourage greater parental\ninvolvement in the racially isolated schools.\nThe School District has for the first time during this litigation developed a Comprehensive School Safety and\nSecurity Plan, which begins to thoroughly address many of the school safety and security issues it currently\nfaces. The School District also developed a new Curriculum Renewal Plan, which builds upon its curriculum\nframeworks and offers a document that will guide the School District's work in the areas of curriculum and\ninstruction. The Plans were filed with the Court in May and September 2001, respectively. See School District\nExhibits 2 and 10. The Court held hearings on September 17, 2001 to review the Plans in particular and the\nSchool District's compliance with various other components of the Remedial Order in general.\n\nb. School District Witnesses\nThe School District presented the following credible and highly experienced witnesses to testify at the hearing.\nInterim Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Philip R. Goldsmith was hired by the School District in his current capacity\nin November 2000, after the School Board decided to follow the CEO model adopted by many of the larger urban\nschool districts around the nation. His responsibilities include oversight of the School District's fiscal, budgetary\nand managerial affairs associated with its 264 buildings. That oversight entails \"fortifying\" the system to make it a\nsafe and secure environment where students have qualified and motivated teachers in each classroom. A\ngraduate of George Washington University School of Law, Mr. Goldsmith brings experience in the fields of law,\njournalism, local government, banking and human resources consulting. Among his prior positions, Mr. Goldsmith\nhas served as president of PNC National Bank, Executive Director of The Philadelphia Bar Association and\nDeputy Mayor of the City of Philadelphia for Policy Planning.\nChief Safety Executive Dexter Green was hired by the School District in May 2001 to oversee the Office of\nSchool Climate and Safety, while remaining in a liaison role with the Philadelphia Police Department. He is\nresponsible for implementing the Comprehensive School Safety and Security Plan. His functions include, inter\nalia, the assessment and evaluation of current School District programs to achieve a system-wide approach to\nschool safety using best practices; oversight of a more proactive prevention and intervention program; training\nand deployment of School District police personnel; monitoring and enforcing a strengthened district-wide crisis\n269 management plan; and generally *269 working toward the creation of a safe environment in the schools.\nA former mathematics teacher educated at LaSalle University and Temple University, Mr. Green has served as a\nPolice Lieutenant, Police Captain, Police Inspector and Chief Inspector for the Philadelphia Police Department as\nwell as Acting Chief of Police for the Philadelphia Housing Authority Police Department. He has acted as a\nconsultant in police training and community policing with various police departments and municipalities located in\nWashington, D.C., San Diego, California, Austin, Texas, Atlantic City, New Jersey and Providence, Rhode Island,\namong others. The School District offered Mr. Green as an expert in public safety, community engagement, police\ntraining and security issues, without objection from opposing counsel. Mr. Green was so qualified by the Court.\nChief Academic Officer Dr. Deidre R. Farmbry assumed her newly created position in August 2000. She is\nresponsible for the curriculum and overall instructional activity of the School District, and she will oversee\nimplementation of the Curriculum Renewal Plan. Her functions include improving the professional development of\nteaching staff and expanding parental involvement in the schools. Dr. Farmbry received her Doctor of Education\ndegree from the University of Pennsylvania, with a dissertation focusing on school reform. She received a\nSuperintendent's letter of eligibility in 1992. Dr. Farmbry has 27 years of experience with the School District,\nhaving served as a former Cluster Leader of the Roxborough Cluster, Principal of Simon Gratz High School,\nAdministrative Assistant to the former and highly regarded Superintendent of Schools Dr. Constance B. Clayton,\nEnglish Department Head and high school English teacher.\nDeputy Academic Officer Dr. Joseph A. Jacovino returned to the School District in August 2001 to head its new\nOffice of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment. He reports directly to Dr. Farmbry and is responsible for\noverseeing the areas of curriculum, instruction and assessment of student progress. Dr. Jacovino was employed\nfor more than 20 years in the School District before his return in August. He served in the capacity of Director of\nthe Office of Curriculum Support, senior high school Curriculum Coordinator, secondary Social Studies\nCurriculum Specialist, Administrative Head of the Parkway Program and Head of the Parkway Program Social\nStudies Department. He holds a Doctor of Education degree from the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on\neducation leadership in the area of curriculum and instruction. Dr. Jacovino currently serves as an adjunct\nprofessor of curriculum theory at a local university, and he has provided consulting services to various school\ndistricts and educational entities on issues surrounding the development and implementation of academic\n[4]\nstandards.  The School District offered Dr. Jacovino as an expert in the areas of curriculum, instruction and\nassessment and related professional training, without objection from opposing counsel. He was so qualified by\nthe Court.\n\nc. Comprehensive School Safety and Security Plan\n270 The Remedial Order required the School District to \"provide a school climate in *270 which teachers can\neffectively teach and students can properly learn.\" HRC VII, 651 A.2d at 192. The Court directed the School\nDistrict to incorporate into its Comprehensive School Safety and Security Plan all feasible and effective\nrecommendations submitted by law enforcement participants in the School District's Law Enforcement Task\nForce developed in Spring 2000; by the Harnett Consulting Team's June 2000 \"Report to the School District on\nSchool Safety\"; by the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Urban Affairs Committee, November 2000\n\"Report of First Class City's Subcommittee Investigation Into Violence in Philadelphia Public Schools\"; by the\nPhiladelphia Federation of Teachers (PFT); and by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. The Plan\ncontains recommendations and input from the above sources in addition to the other resources relied upon by the\nSchool District.\nMr. Goldsmith explained the development process and indicated that the School District solicited input from\nschool districts in New York and Houston and other cities to create a comprehensive approach to school safety.\nThe Comprehensive School Safety and Security Plan is designed to improve school climate and environment by\npromoting a sense of discipline and fairness; to minimize classroom disruption quickly and effectively; and to\nincrease the safety and security of students and teachers. Mr. Goldsmith candidly acknowledged that adequate\nschool safety is a central office function, and he intends to \"transition out\" of the practice whereby schools are\nforced to choose between an art or math teacher to obtain needed security personnel. A major goal is to\nprofessionalize the School District's security personnel and non-teaching assistants (NTAs), to deploy security\npersonnel appropriately and to train personnel in the proper use of existing technology. He believes that the Plan\nrepresents a good \"blueprint\" for the action that must be taken and that it provides clear objectives, strategies to\nmeet those objectives, outcomes and timelines and a process for implementation.\nMr. Green testified that his efforts will be directed by the Comprehensive School Safety and Security Plan, which\nin his professional opinion contains realistic and attainable goals. He has assessed and evaluated the School\nDistrict's current security programs, and he described his system-wide approach to using best practices to create\na safe environment in the schools. Mr. Green will work closely with principals to review individual school safety\nand security plans and will make prevention and intervention a priority along with enforcement. Plans are\nunderway to provide professional development through the Philadelphia Police College for the School District's\n452 school police officers, the third largest municipal police force in the Commonwealth. Training will center\naround law enforcement and juvenile justice issues and the handling and managing of disruptive students. NTAs\nwill receive fewer hours of similar instruction and training, and noontime aids will receive, to a lesser extent, in-\nhouse training.\nMr. Green articulated other priorities, which include the establishment of uniform criteria for the deployment of\nsecurity personnel in middle and high schools and an assessment of the effectiveness and use of existing\ntechnology (e.g., metal detectors, swipe card systems, mobile scan units and cameras). He emphasized the\nSchool District's top priority to expand the Safe Corridors Program so that at a minimum every elementary school\nis included, and he stated that racially isolated schools will take first priority in this process. He observed that the\n271 success of this program depends upon participation first and foremost *271 from parents as volunteers in making\nsure that their children have safe passageways to their respective schools. Mr. Green provided assurances that\nhis office will incorporate other exemplary violence-prevention programs in the racially isolated schools and that\nthe School District will expand throughout all of the schools an anti-bullying program recognized as an exemplary\npractice by the United States Department of Education. The program currently exists only in North Philadelphia\nschools. In addition, school discipline data will be evaluated to assess racial impact, and his office will coordinate\n[5]\nwith other School District offices to expand the truancy program to improve student attendance.\n\nd. Curriculum Renewal Plan\nThe Remedial Order required the School District to develop clear educational standards for curricula which define\nwhat students should learn and what teachers should teach to improve the academic achievement of students.\nThe need to develop strong student foundations in language arts, math and other core academic subjects\nremains a paramount challenge, particularly in many of the racially isolated high schools. The Remedial Order\nalso called for the School District to develop an effective professional development program to correspond to its\ncurriculum plan. Dr. Farmbry stated that her priority is to foster uniformity in instructional practices and district-\nwide coordination in instruction and assessment and centrally designed professional development. Random and\ndisconnected professional development will cease. To this end the School District created a new organizational\nstructure which eliminated the prior cluster model with its many layers and replaced it with 10 Academic Area\nOffices to prominently place the focus where it should be. These offices follow feeder patterns consistent with the\ncluster model and include 35 to 40 schools per area. The new organizational structure includes a director of\ninstruction, a director of curriculum and a director of assessment along with a new Office of Principal and Teacher\n[6]\nDevelopment.\nDr. Farmbry testified that for the past year she assessed the continuity in instructional programs toward\ndevelopment of the Curriculum Renewal Plan, which will guide all of the activities of her office. The Plan contains\nthe following four goals: implement core curriculum, match curriculum and assessment, meet the needs of\n272 special populations and connect professional development to the core curriculum.[7] Curriculum *272 frameworks\nadopted by the School Board in 1997 provided the starting point, and they have been modified where appropriate\nand aligned with available state academic standards. According to Dr. Jacovino these frameworks articulate a full\nyear of content but do not specify what should be taught or when. That function was articulated in development of\nthe new \"scope and sequence\" schematic, which details the content to be taught students and the order in which\nit is to be taught along with other guides to assist teachers, particularly new ones, in their instructional activity.\nThe Plan also for the first time provides a strong component for professional development, and it allows for an\naudit of the schools to ensure that they offer appropriate grade level courses. The School District disaggregates\nits student assessment data by race, and it will intensify its focusing on the racial disparities in achievement as\nwell as the racial disparities in student assignments to special education programs.\nDr. Farmbry and Dr. Jacovino have instituted many other initiatives, including new report cards to reflect the\nCurriculum Renewal Plan. New features of the reorganization include the assignment of instructional coaches to\nclassrooms and an expansion of responsibility on principals to assure better training of their teachers. Curriculum\ncouncils now exist to review and offer advice to central staff on curriculum initiatives and to participate in the\nstrengthening of each middle and high school's curriculum program. These councils are comprised of teachers\nselected by their principals, and they possess expertise in particular content areas.\nDr. Jacovino readily acknowledged that the work in his office will be ongoing, and he opined that the Curriculum\nRenewal Plan represents an ambitious but a logical document containing order and sequence for subject content\ndelivery, which will ensure an equitable opportunity to all students to learn. The Plan represents the \"yardstick\" by\nwhich Dr. Jacovino's office will conduct its district-wide activity and the focus for professional development.\nAppendix E (\"Triangle\") to the Plan contains a listing of its components: mission, curriculum vision, curriculum\nframeworks, scope and sequence, course guides, units of study and lesson plans. The mission includes\nimproving the academic achievement of students in the areas of literacy, math and science, and the vision\nincorporates a coherent curriculum plan containing a unified and core curriculum.\nDr. Jacovino explained each of the components of the Curriculum Renewal Plan in greater detail and explained\nhow the School District developed the new scope and sequence for each identified content area to help organize\ncontent for delivery by teachers in a sequential manner. The scope and sequence represents a floor and will be\nmandatory for all of the schools, all of the teachers and all grade levels, as will other components of the Plan. Dr.\nJacovino indicated that the listing represents the model for the Plan and the shift to a new and more focused\napproach to the way the School District intends to conduct its instructional activities. This shift also includes a\nchange in the curriculum, instructional and assessment activities related to special student populations and the\n\naddition of needed supports for teachers required to teach this population in the regular education classroom. He\nalso cautioned that the School District must ensure that the Plan and its learning goals in the scope and\nsequence match the learning goals in the assessments used to measure student progress. Assessment profiles\ncurrently underway should produce this result and at the same time reduce the number of assessments so that\ninstructional time may be increased.\n273  e. Outcomes\n*273\nThe School District projects a two-year implementation period for its Comprehensive School Safety and Security\nPlan and the Curriculum Renewal Plan. Because of the House of Representatives' Urban Affairs Committee\nReport, the School District recognizes the need for more accurate and thorough reporting of school safety\nviolations, and it has committed itself to this process. Some of the stated outcomes for the Comprehensive\nSchool Safety and Security Plan include, among others, an increase in parental involvement through school\ncouncils and other strategies along with an expansion of community partnerships; an increase in the average\ndaily attendance of students district-wide; a revision of the School District's Code of Student Conduct; an\nincrease in alternative placements of disruptive students; a more effective strategy for plotting school violence\ntrends; the adoption by each school of a safety/crisis-management plan based upon a standardized model; and\nthe development of audit procedures for each school.\nProjected outcomes for the Curriculum Renewal Plan include, among others, the implementation of the pilot\nEnglish language arts and math K-12 scope and sequence and core units of study during 2001-2002 for full\nimplementation next year; a reevaluation of textbooks and materials to ensure that core content areas are\nadequately addressed; a completion of the assessment profile by September 2001 to present to the School\nBoard; a completion of professional development for K-3 teachers on the new K-3 literacy assessments; the\nconvening of regular data review meetings throughout the year to monitor, target and address student\nachievement results; and a review of curriculum and assessment initiatives to determine the impact on special\nstudent populations and professional development regarding instructional practices for these students.\nII.\nOther Compliance Areas\nThe Court ordered full-day kindergarten for all eligible students in racially isolated schools effective September\n1996 and for all remaining eligible students effective September 1997. The School District agreed to comply with\nthe Court's Order after contempt proceedings were convened in 1996. Dr. Farmbry noted that state test results\n(PSSA) for the past year of fourth grade students provided full-day kindergarten exceeded the statewide\naverages in reading and math and that subsequent groups of children who received full-day kindergarten are\nentering first, second, third and fourth grades with much higher skill levels than before. Katherine Conner, a long-\ntime School District Administrator (now Executive Director of the Office of Policy Planning and Compliance),\nreinforced the fact that students who received full-day kindergarten have consistently performed at higher levels\nin reading and math and that a review of the past 5 years of the kindergarten program indicates that it will have a\nlasting effect in terms of student achievement. Also she noted that based on SAT-9 test results for last year, the\nracial gap in academic achievement has begun to narrow for the lower grades and in eighth grade reading.\nThese results demonstrate in part the wisdom of investing in early education programs for the City's children,\nparticularly children attending the racially isolated schools.\nOver 1000 literacy interns are now employed within elementary schools in grades K-2 to reduce class size. The\nHuman Relations Commission shall determine whether all of the elementary racially isolated schools have been\n274 assigned literacy *274 interns in grades K-2, to what extent they have been assigned to the remaining racially\nisolated schools and in general the extent to which the School District has prioritized literacy programs for all\nracially isolated schools. Literacy issues related to students in the racially isolated schools have continued to\nframe this case. It therefore is essential that priority be given to these children when decisions are made for\n\nschools to participate in new or existing literacy programs, some of which have been identified in the Curriculum\nRenewal Plan (Reading to Succeed, Reading for Excellency and Technology Literacy Challenge).\nDr. Farmbry noted that 91 certified school councils have been established in 111 racially isolated schools and\nthat full-time efforts are underway to establish councils in the remaining 20 racially isolated schools, but \"suitable\nalternatives\" are now being considered. Because parents and children in the remaining schools are entitled to the\nsame or to a greater level of effort generated in creating school councils in the other schools, neither the Court\nnor the School District should abandon this requirement. Therefore, the School District shall complete this\nprocess as previously directed and pursuant to prior assurances given to the Court that all racially isolated\nschools will have school councils by the end of 2001. This period may be extended to June 2002. The School\nDistrict clearly is not precluded from otherwise creating ways to encourage parental involvement in these\nremaining schools. It is crucial that every available strategy be utilized to get these parents more actively involved\nin the education of their children.\nIII.\nConclusion\nThe School District's representatives have worked over the past two years with the Court, the Human Relations\nCommission and the Intervenors, and they readily agreed at the hearing to continue to meet with Counsel for the\nHuman Relations Commission and for the Intervenors along with representatives of the PFT to ensure that all\nfeasible steps are taken to effectively implement the new Comprehensive School Safety and Security Plan and\nthe new Curriculum Renewal Plan. The Human Relations Commission shall continue to monitor the School\nDistrict's progress and may require an annual report beginning in June or September 2002 of the School District's\nimplementation of its new Plans and other compliance activities. Particular emphasis should be on the review of\nassessment data documenting the rate of academic achievement of students in racially isolated schools and the\nSchool District's progress in expanding parental involvement in these schools. For the reasons discussed, and at\nthe request of the Human Relations Commission and the Intervenors, the Court hereby approves the School\nDistrict's Comprehensive School Safety and Security Plan and its Curriculum Renewal Plan for full\nimplementation and planned distribution.\nAfter several years of exercising jurisdiction over this enforcement case, the Court is satisfied that the School\nDistrict has made a significant and continued effort to comply with the Remedial Order and that the\nComprehensive Safety and Security Plan and the Curriculum Renewal Plan present a renewed opportunity for\nthe School District to effectively respond to many of the educational issues that it faces. Despite more than 30\nyears of litigation in this case and the indefensible delays in providing an equal educational opportunity to\n275 children in the racially isolated schools, the foundation nevertheless remains for the Court's enforcement of *275\nthis right. The United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (Brown I), 347 U.S. 483,\n74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), warned that no child may reasonably be expected to succeed if denied an\neducation, which is a right that must be made available on equal terms. Thirteen years later in 1967, the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court in Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester School District, 427 Pa.\n157, 233 A.2d 290 (1967), graphically described the consequences to children denied equal opportunities in\neducation.\nAs detailed more fully in earlier opinions in this matter, the Human Relations Commission issued an amended\nfinal order in 1972 determining that the School District was unlawfully segregated in violation of the Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Act, Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. §§ 951-963, resulting in a lack of\nequal educational opportunity. Over the years various plans have been proposed to remedy that illegal and\npernicious condition. The Comprehensive School Safety and Security Plan and the Curriculum Renewal Plan\nhave now been proposed and accepted by the Court and hold promise that, if effectively implemented, they will\nadvance the goals of this litigation. The Human Relations Commission shall request the Court to close this case\nwhen it is satisfied that the School District has demonstrated that it can and will provide an equal educational\nopportunity to all of its students.\n\nORDER\nAnd now this 28th day of September, 2001, the Court hereby approves the School District of Philadelphia's new\nComprehensive School Safety and Security Plan and its new Curriculum Renewal Plan filed with the Court in\nMay and September 2001, respectively. The Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission shall monitor the\nSchool District's implementation of these Plans and its compliance generally with the Court's 1994 Remedial\nOrder consistent with the foregoing opinion.\n[1]Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia, 557 Pa. 126, 732 A.2d 578\n(1999) (Petition of Commonwealth and Governor Ridge). The Supreme Court remanded this case in May 1999\nafter assuming jurisdiction in July 1996 and ultimately vacating on procedural grounds the Court's order, inter\nalia, for the Commonwealth and Governor of Pennsylvania, joined as parties to the case, to provide additional\nfunding to the School District to defray costs and expenses associated with remedying discrimination against\nBlack and Hispanic students in racially isolated schools and for the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation\nAuthority to monitor and inspect the School District's fiscal and management activities, as it has done for the City\nof Philadelphia, to assist the School District in resolving its underlying fiscal problems.\n[2] The Court crafted the Remedial Order after consideration of extensive trial testimony from national and local\neducational experts and an evaluation of School District instructional and other activities by a Court-appointed\nteam of seven national and local educational experts. Components of the Order relate to parental involvement,\neducational improvement, desegregation strategies, resource generation, school climate, safety and discipline,\norganizational restructuring, accountability, facilities, overcrowding and reporting and monitoring of School District\nprogress. See also Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia (HRC VI), 161\nPa.Cmwlth.658, 638 A.2d 304 (1994) (Court determined that children in racially isolated public schools in\nPhiladelphia were denied equal educational opportunity).\n[3] Additional conferences were held over the past two years between and among the parties and their Counsel,\nMichael Hardiman, Michael Churchill and Lynn R. Rauch, the Court-appointed Education Monitors, Dr. Frank Tota\nand Dr. Dolores Silva, and at times with representatives and officials of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers\n(Jack Steinberg, Jerry Jordan and Rosalyn Johnson). Dr. Tota is the former president of the national Urban\nSchool Superintendents Association, and Dr. Silva is a professor and national scholar in curriculum theory and\ndesign.\n[4]See School District's Exhibits 1, 7, 9 and 11 (representing biographical documents for each of the School\nDistrict's witnesses).\n[5] Reducing the threshold for Truancy Court intervention from 25 to 20 unexcused absences will no doubt\nproduce positive results along with other stated initiatives, but more drastic action is needed to reduce student\nabsenteeism at a faster rate than projected. The truancy officer was eliminated and replaced with family or other\nnetwork staff under the prior Administration, with the unmet expectation that attendance would significantly\nimprove. Perhaps the time has come to revisit the effectiveness of truancy officers and whether they should\nresume a role in resolving the high student absenteeism within the School District.\n[6] With each new administration, the tendency exists to change the current organizational structure. The new\nAcademic Area structure, however, appears to offer a less complex and more focused way of providing\ninstruction to public school children. Because students, parents and teachers are entitled to some measure of\nconsistency and stability in the educational reform effort underway in Philadelphia, it is anticipated that the\npresent organizational structure will remain, and be strengthened where necessary, on into the indefinite future.\n[7] The criteria followed for curriculum development is implicit but nowhere is it expressly stated in the Curriculum\nRenewal Plan. The School District will provide this information to Counsel and to the Court, and it must be added\nas an addendum to the Plan.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

As of Fall 1975, 10% or 24,424 out of 263,140 students were attending desegregated schools.\nAs of January 1980, 11% or 25,651 out of 233,892 students were attending desegregated\nschools. This means that 208,241 students or 89% are still attending segregated schools.\n12. In a document adopted by the Board entitled `Proposed Plans for Implementation of Voluntary\nDesegregation' dated April 24, 1978 (a copy of which is attached as Exhibit `B'), Respondent\nnamed fifty-five (55) schools that it projected would be desegregated by September 1979.\n158 *158 13. Respondent has not achieved its own desegregation goals for September 1979 since\n82% or forty-five (45) of the fifty-five (55) schools were still segregated as of September 1979.\nThe Commission asked that\na rule be granted upon Respondent school district of Philadelphia to show cause why it should not\nbe ordered to submit a new desegregation plan embodying traditional mandatory methods which\nwill realistically desegregate the Philadelphia School System forthwith and such other relief as this\nCourt deems appropriate and proper.\nThe school district admitted the allegations contained in Paragraph 10 and 12 of the Application and denied the\nother allegations set forth above on the sole ground that, in the district's view, in preparing the statistics contained\ntherein the Commission improperly and unfairly employed a definition of the term \"segregated school\" which had\nbeen promulgated by the Commission at the very end of the period specified by this Court for the implementation\nof the plan.\nFollowing the exchange of interrogatories and a pretrial conference conducted on September 15, 1980, four days\nof evidentiary hearings were held in Philadelphia in January, 1981.\nA great deal of effort has been devoted by the district and the Commission in an attempt to persuade this Court of\nthe propriety of the various conceptual tools used to measure the district's progress pursuant to the voluntary\nplan. Specifically, the parties have derived three definitions of the crucial term \"segregated school\":\n(a) The Commission's 1968 definition: according to this definition a segregated school is one in\n159 which the proportion of Negro pupils is not *159 within 30% of the average proportion of Negro\npupils in district schools of the same grade span. This definition first appeared in the\nCommission's May 15, 1968, document entitled `Recommended Elements of a School\nDesegregation Plan.' Subject to court challenge, this definition was approved by this Court and by\nour Supreme Court in Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Norristown School District,\n20 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 555, 342 A.2d 464 (1975) aff'd 473 Pa. 334, 374 A.2d 671 (1977). This\ndefinition was in effect at the time of our 1977 Order retaining jurisdiction during the planning and\nimplementation period. The district contends that this definition is not usable in Philadelphia due to\nthe high proportion of black students in certain grade spans. Several of the Commission's\nwitnesses, including Roy Yaffe, former assistant general counsel to the Commission, and Richard\nAnliot, the Commission's Director of the Division of Education, support this contention. Indeed, it\nwas precisely this objection that led the Commission to formulate its 1979 definition.\n(b) The Commission's 1979 definition: according to this definition a segregated school is one\nwhich either has less than 25% white enrollment or less than 40% black enrollment unless the\n\nschool contains at least 20% Hispanic enrollment in which case it is segregated if it also contains\nless than 25% black enrollment. The school district argues, with some force, that it would be unfair\nfor this Court to judge the district's performance by means of this definition since it was not\nannounced by the Commission until some time after December 17, 1979, near the end of the\nimplementation period.\n160 *160 (c) The school district's 1978 definition: according to this definition a segregated school is\none which contains either less than 25% white enrollment or more than 75% white enrollment. As\nwe will discuss, the Commission and its expert witness, Dr. Foster, have serious objections to the\nuse of this definition in measuring progress pursuant to the 1976 voluntary plan.\nOf course, any determination of the degree to which the School District of Philadelphia has, through the\nimplementation of its voluntary plan, made progress in desegregating its schools will depend on some device for\nthe measurement of the extent to which the district was segregated before the implementation of the plan and the\nextent to which that segregation has thereafter decreased. The presence of substantial objections to each of the\ndefinitional devices used for this purpose by the parties can only be said to have complicated the already difficult\ntask before this Court.\nIt is the testimony of Homer Floyd, the Commission's Executive Director, that employees of the Commission first\nmet with district staff members in September, 1979, for the purpose of obtaining from the district enrollment data\nnecessary to evaluate progress pursuant to the 1976 voluntary plan. Following receipt of the requested\ninformation and its analysis by the Commission's staff, an ad hoc committee of the Commission consisting of\nCommissioners Loewenstein, Echols, Leader, and Scott, reported to the Commission and to the Board of\nEducation that, in their judgment insufficient progress had been demonstrated to warrant the committee's\nrecommendation to the full Commission that the plan receive the Commission's continued support.\n161 The committee then recommended on February 25, 1980 that further discussions be held with the district *161 to\ndetermine whether additional progress was possible in the absence of substantial modification of the voluntary\nplan. On March 3, 1980, it was indicated to the district that additional evidence had to be received by the\nCommission by April 15, 1980 in support of the district's contention that the voluntary plan was a sufficient\nresponse to its duty under the law to desegregate the public schools. When no such additional support was\nforthcoming by the date indicated, the Commission, on April 28, 1980, adopted a resolution expressing its\njudgment that progress under the 1976 Voluntary Plan was insufficient and authorizing the pursuit of available\nlegal remedies to effect modifications of the voluntary plan.\nMr. Floyd further testified that the Commission is not opposed to the use of its 1968 definition in evaluating the\neffectiveness of the voluntary desegregation plan although the Commission would favor for the use of its 1979\ndefinition. The Commission strongly opposes the use of the school district's 1978 definition because the school\ndistrict was, in the Commission's view, without power to promulgate such a definition, because the definition is\ninvalid in classifying as desegregated a school in which the proportion of white students is 75% although the\nproportion of white students in the district as a whole is only 40% and because, in Mr. Floyd's studied opinion,\nuse of the definition would have the effect of placing a disproportionate share of the burden of the desegregation\n[1]\neffort on black students by requiring greater reassignment of black students than of their white counterparts.\n162 *162 It is the opinion of Mr. Richard B. Anliot, for the last twenty-two years the Director of the Commission's\nDivision of Education and the Commission's staff member primarily responsible for the analysis of enrollment\ndata provided by the district, that although the voluntary plan has expanded the educational opportunities\navailable to public school students in Philadelphia it has not, as evidenced by the statistics set forth as factual\n163 findings one through three below, accomplished *163 \"substantial progress towards desegregation during [the\nperiod between the fall of 1977 and the fall of 1980].\" Mr. Anliot particularly emphasizes that even by the school\ndistrict's more favorable definition, the number of black segregated schools, i.e. those with a proportion of black\nstudents in excess of 75%, has only decreased by 2% since 1977.\nAdditional desegregation methods which have been suggested by the Commission and by the district's staff but\nwhich are not a part of the voluntary plan and have not been adopted by the school board include the\nreassignment so as to further desegregation of pupils enrolled in schools which must be closed on account of a\n\ndecline in enrollment or for other reasons; the mandatory \"pairing\" or \"clustering\" of contiguous segregated\nschools if the resulting combined attendance area would permit the reassignment of pupils so as to create\ndesegregated institutions; and an increase in financial commitment to the district's magnet programs.\nIt is the policy of the Board of Education to require no pairing of contiguous schools without regard to the\nfurtherance of desegregation which could be thereby achieved. Pairings to advance desegregation are suggested\nby the district but are permitted to proceed only if a consensus can be reached with the staff, administration, and\ncommunity of the particular schools involved.\nIt is the opinion of Dr. Gordon Foster, professor of education at the University of Miami, Florida and the editor,\nauthor or contributor to over forty studies or surveys in the area of school desegregation, that the school district's\n1978 definition is unacceptable for use in a predominantly black school district like Philadelphia. Dr. Foster further\ntestified that the Commission's 1968 definition is similar to the definitions used by many agencies and school\n164 districts across the country *164 and is appropriate for use in Philadelphia although a certain \"awkwardness\"\nresults when the definition is applied to schools in grade spans with an extremely high proportion of black pupils.\nDr. Foster's opinion, based on an analysis of the trend implicit in the evidence, is that a maximum of 10,000\nadditional students will become enrolled in desegregated schools as a result of continued efforts pursuant to the\nvoluntary plan. In addition, it is Dr. Foster's opinion that voluntary plans have generally had limited success in\nnorthern cities and that the voluntary plan of the School District of Philadelphia has proved to be unacceptable in\npractice by placing the burden of the desegregation effort on black students and their parents and by failing to\nresult in the desegregation of identifiably black schools.\nDr. Foster testified that from his review of the data admitted into evidence, the increase in desegregation\naccomplished by implementation of the voluntary plan has been, primarily, the result of the transportation of black\nstudents to formerly all-white or predominantly white schools for the most part located in the northeastern section\nof the city. Therefore, in Dr. Foster's opinion, if the transportation of students to schools outside of their\nneighborhood is a burden on those students and their parents, equity on a racial basis in the allocation of this\nburden has not been achieved by implementation of the voluntary plan.\nDr. Foster further testified that his review of the statistical evidence revealed no school which contained a\nproportion of black students in excess of 90% in 1977, before the implementation of the voluntary plan, which has\nbeen desegregated as a result of efforts pursuant to the plan. In Dr. Foster's opinion this observation, if borne out\nby a more exhaustive examination of the data provided by the school district, would constitute a particularly\n165 forceful indictment of the voluntary *165 plan because the \"root goal\" of a desegregation effort, in Dr. Foster's\nview, ought to be a decrease in the racial isolation of black students in the district by means of a decrease in the\nnumber of all black or nearly all black schools.\nDr. Richard D. Hanusey, the district's associate superintendent in charge of coordinating the desegregation effort\nin terms of program design, staff development, community relations, student and staff transfers, allocation of\ninstructional materials, equipment and supplies, pupil transportation and funding testified that the following\nprograms, at a combined cost of approximately $12 million, have been created since 1977 as part of the\nvoluntary plan:\n(A) Magnet Schools: The High School for Creative and Performing Arts, the High School for\nEngineering and Science, the Middle School for Science and Mathematics. Each of these\nprograms is desegregated by the school district's definition and each provides an accelerated\ncurriculum in a particular discipline for students who have demonstrated an interest and aptitude\nin that discipline.\n(B) The Girard Academic Music Program (GAMP) is a desegregated program in which all students\nenrolled in the Girard Annex (grades 5-9) receive special instruction in the areas of vocal and\ninstrumental music.\n(C) The Edison Satellite Program is a desegregated course of study encompassing an\nexperimental curriculum designed to meet the needs of talented tenth through twelfth graders who\nhave not achieved their demonstrated potential in the context of a regular school experience.\n\n166 (D) The Academy for Academic Excellence is a desegregated program located in the John *166\nStory Jenks School emphasizing basic and traditional academic disciplines.\n(E) The Academic Academy for Middle Years emphasizes basic and traditional academic\ndisciplines and offers `enriched' foreign language, math, and science courses involving greater\nteacher contact to students in the sixth through eighth grades. The Academic Academy for Middle\nYears is not desegregated by any of the definitions previously described.\n(F) The Shawmont Academic Music Program (SAM) is a desegregated program providing\ninstruction to interested elementary students in vocal and instrumental music as well as musical\ntheory and performance.\n(G) The Kensington Youth Program (KEY) is a desegregated program providing individualized and\nspecialized instruction including career development to students in the tenth through twelfth\ngrades who are considered to be among those otherwise unlikely to complete their high school\neducation.\n(H) Instructional Enrichment Centers providing additional staff and other resources and added\nemphasis on basic math, reading and science skills have been initiated in thirteen formerly\nsegregated elementary and junior high schools. They have enjoyed limited success in furthering\ndesegregation.\n(I) Basic Skills and Unified Arts Programs created within two elementary schools provide\nindividualized instruction in the areas of art, music, dance, language arts and drama. One of these\nprograms is desegregated.\n(J) Multi-language and Multi-Cultural Programs, created within three desegregated elementary\n167 schools, provide intensive instruction *167 in English as a second language, including parent\ntutorials, to Hispanic students. None of these programs are to date large enough to desegregate\nthe schools in which they are located.\n(K) Child Development Centers (CDC's) have been created in three segregated elementary\nschools to provide full-day kindergarten and day care services. One school has been\ndesegregated as a result of the addition of a CDC.\n(L) Academic Plus Magnet Schools provide at two locations greater structure and discipline,\nregular homework, a dress code and minimum requirements for promotion to pupils in the\nelementary grades and, at one location, to pupils in grades six through eight. One of these\nprograms is desegregated.\n(M) The Alternative for Middle Years Program (AMY) and the Middle Years Alternative for the\nHumanities (MYA), at three locations, provide a specialized curriculum for sixth through eighth\ngraders interested in the study of ancient and modern human cultures. These programs are\ndesegregated.\n(N) Citywide Special Admission Schools include Central High School and Philadelphia High\nSchool for Girls, the Conwell Middle Magnet School, the Franklin Learning Center, the five\ncomponent Parkway Program, the Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School and the Saul\nHigh School of Agricultural Sciences. All of these programs are open to public and non-public\nschool children who meet certain pre-admission, application, testing and interviewing\nrequirements. Racial controls on enrollment are designed to ensure that the programs are\ndesegregated. Several of the Special Admission Schools pre-date the voluntary plan.\n168 *168 (O) Two separate contiguous school pairings have been encouraged and effected by Dr.\nHanusey and his staff as part of the voluntary plan. These involve the Powers Elementary School\ncombined with the Willard Elementary School and the `Girard/Poe pairing' which has resulted in\n\nthe Girard School serving kindergarten and grades one through four and the Girard Annex serving\nthe fifth through seventh grades.\nThe difficulties posed by implementation of the voluntary desegregation plan in the fall of 1978 were greatly\nincreased, in Dr. Hanusey's opinion, by teacher union activity during that period and by the requirement by\nfederal authorities that approximately 4,000 professional staff members of the district be reassigned as the result\nof a determination by those authorities that the district's staffing policies were in violation of federal civil rights\nlaws. Additional difficulties were created by the failure of expected and approved funding pursuant to the federal\nEmergency School Assistance Act to materialize on schedule. Other obstacles to rapid desegregation of the\nPhiladelphia school district, in Dr. Hanusey's view, include the geographic size of the district, the degree to which\nneighborhoods within the district are segregated, and the presence of an extensive and well-established\nparochial alternative to public education.\nIn Dr. Hanusey's opinion, approximately 12,000 additional students will be involved in desegregated education in\nthe 1981-1982 school year as a result of continued efforts with respect to the voluntary plan. Thereafter,\nassuming a constant funding level, approximately 10,000 additional students can be expected to participate in\ndesegregated educational experience as a result of the plan. At that unspecified point in the future, assuming the\n169 indefinite continuance of efforts *169 pursuant to the voluntary plan, approximately 84,000 students (of the now\nabout 224,000) will be enrolled in desegregated schools. It is Dr. Hanusey's opinion that this represents the\nmaximum level of desegregation achievable by wholly voluntary means.\nIn Dr. Hanusey's view the great advantage of pursuing a course of deliberate voluntarism in the desegregation of\nthe Philadelphia schools is the possibility of thereby achieving some measure of desegregation while avoiding\ncommunity unrest. Moreover, the particular programmatic additions resulting from the efforts of Dr. Hanusey and\nhis staff have created, as he described it, a veritable \"smorgasbord of [educational] opportunities\" for Philadelphia\npublic school students.\nOn May 27, 1980, Dr. Hanusey submitted for action by the Board of Education a suggested resolution mandating\nseventeen separate pairings of contiguous schools in order to further the desegregation effort. Dr. Hanusey\ntestified that he remains convinced of the necessity of requiring the combination of the schools specified in the\nproposed resolution but that despite his counsel to that effect to the Board of Education, the proposed resolution\nhas been defeated. However, the Board of Education has taken steps, at the urging of Dr. Hanusey, to revise\npupil transfer policies so as to ensure that the desegregation effort is not circumvented by individual students and\ntheir families; to develop new magnet programs affiliated with the city's universities; to expand existing magnet\nprograms; and to subsidize the transportation costs of students who volunteer to attend other than their\nneighborhood school in order to further the desegregation effort.\nOn cross-examination Dr. Hanusey conceded that his projections of additional gains to be accomplished through\n170 continued voluntary efforts are optimistic *170 and include among the schools anticipated to be desegregated in\nthe near future certain named schools which have experienced in recent years increasing segregation. This\napparent anomaly is explained by the expectation that increased funding will permit additional programs to be\nplaced in the schools specified and that these programs will result in the desegregation of the host schools.\nOn the subject of the level of funding necessary to sustain the voluntary desegregation effort and to make\npossible the projected additional gains set forth above, Dr. Hanusey testified that he would require in the\n1981-1982 school year at least $14 million in combined local and federal (ESAA) support. Whether this level of\nfunding would be forthcoming was not known at the time of the hearing.\nDr. Robert L. Crain, senior social scientist for the Rand Corporation in Washington, D.C., principal research\nscientist with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland and the author of four texts and numerous articles,\nstudies and surveys on the subject of school desegregation, was called by the school district and testified that he\nhad been hired by the district to act as a consultant with regard to the instant litigation and that he had in that role\nreviewed the particulars of the district's voluntary desegregation plan as well as the evidence previously adduced.\nDr. Crain testified that in his opinion and from his understanding of the relevant scholarly research, an effective\nintegrated school is any school with a proportion of white students between 20% and 80%. For schools with less\n\nthan 20% white students Dr. Crain testified that such schools become identified as black schools with an\ninevitable reduction in the level and qaulity of services provided to the students due to a decrease in community\nand administrative support.\n171 *171 Dr. Crain further testified to the inherent limitation of any conceptual tool, including the three definitions\npreviously described, used to measure desegregative progress which contains a threshold element such that\nonly schools which are above the threshold are considered to be desegregated. By their nature such definitions\nignore significant progress within particular schools if, following efforts pursuant to a desegregation plan, the\nracial characteristics of the student population falls just below the threshold.\nDr. Crain testified that this limitation can be overcome through the use of a statistical construct known to\nresearchers in the field as the \"Desegregation Index.\" In Dr. Crain's opinion the Desegregation Index, which is\ncalculated with reference to the number and proportion of students of each race in each district school in each of\nthe years at issue, has been for twenty years an accepted mathematical tool for measuring progress in school\ndesegregation and is appropriate and useful for application to the Philadelphia schools. The advantage of the\nDesegregation Index, in Dr. Crain's view, is that it is not dependent on a definition of segregated schools but,\ninstead, measures desegregative progress on a pupil by pupil basis; accurately and sensitively reflecting each\nstudent reassignment accomplished by the district in the furtherance of the ultimate goal of having each school\nmirror, to the extent possible, the racial characteristics of the district as a whole. Dr. Crain was unable to provide\nprecise figures, apparently due to the magnitude of the task, with respect to the application of the Desegregation\nIndex to the Philadelphia School District. He estimated that such an analysis would reveal an increase in district\nwide desegregation of approximately 15% as a result of efforts pursuant to the voluntary plan.\n172 In Dr. Crain's opinion, based primarily on his field research and that of Dr. Christine Rossell of Boston *172\nUniversity, a desegregation effort which proceeded at a less deliberate pace than that adopted by the district or\nwhich embodied to a greater extent mandatory tactics would have a more disruptive effect on the city as a whole\nand would result in a massive exodus of white students from the public schools thereby undermining the\npossibility of achieving the goal sought. In this regard Dr. Crain particularly emphasized the presence, as an\nalternative to public schooling, of the school system operated and maintained by the Philadelphia Archdiocese.\nOn cross-examination Dr. Crain conceded that Dr. Rossell, whose writings he had relied on in earlier testimony, in\naddition to her conclusions with respect to the spectre of \"white flight,\" has also written that experience with\nvoluntary desegregation plans has shown such plans to place a disproportionate share of the burden of pupil\ntransportation on black students and that voluntary plans, while they reduce the exodus of white students during\nthe process of desegregation, do not, in districts like Philadelphia which contain a minority enrollment of greater\nthan 30%, produce an acceptable level of desegregation.\nFACTUAL FINDINGS\nOn the basis of the testimony summarized above as well as the uncontradicted statistical evidence of record we\nfind the following facts to have been established:\n(1) As measured by the Commission's 1968 definition; of the 294 schools in the district in the fall of 1977, 51 or\n17% were desegregated and of the 287 district schools in the fall of 1980, 57 or 20% were desegregated. By the\nsame definition; of the 250,932 students attending schools within the district in the fall of 1977, 38,644 or 15%\nattended desegregated schools and of the 224,339 district students in the fall of 1980, 40,180 or 18% attended\n173 desegregated schools. By this *173 definition, therefore, in terms of both schools and students, implementation of\nthe district's voluntary plan has increased the proportion of desegregated experience available to the students of\nthe district by three per cent.\n(2) As measured by the Commission's 1979 definition; of the 294 district schools in the fall of 1977, 30 or 10%\nwere desegregated and of the 287 district schools in the fall of 1980, 37 or 13% were desegregated. By the same\ndefinition; of the 250,932 district students in the fall of 1977, 23,705 or 9% attended desegregated schools and of\nthe 224,339 district students in the fall of 1980, 26,453 or 12% attended desegregated schools. By this definition,\n\ntherefore, as was true under the Commission's 1968 definition, implementation of the district's voluntary plan has\nincreased the proportion of desegregated schools and pupils in those schools by three per cent.\n(3) As measured by the school district's 1978 definition; of the 294 district schools in the fall of 1977, 54 or 18%\nwere desegregated and of the 287 district schools in the fall of 1980, 79 or 28% were desegregated. By the same\ndefinition; of the 250,932 district students in the fall of 1977, 43,593 or 17% attended desegregated schools and\nof the 224,339 district students in the fall of 1980, 62,255 or 28% attended desegregated schools. By this\ndefinition, therefore, implementation of the district's voluntary plan has increased the proportion of desegregated\nschools by 10% and has increased the proportion of students attending desegregated schools by 11%.\n(4) As of November 1, 1977, before the commencement of efforts under the voluntary plan, 113 Philadelphia\nSchools contained a proportion of black students in excess of 90%. On the last day in October, 1980, the number\n174 of such schools was 111. Of the 113 schools in 1977, nine are not included in the set of those schools *174 with\ngreater than 90% black populations in 1980. Since the total number of such schools in 1980 has decreased by\nonly two it is clear that some schools have become increasingly segregated over the period. Of the nine schools\nwith greater than 90% black populations in 1977 which are not included in the set of such schools in 1980, seven\nhave been, during the interim, closed and the pupils there enrolled have been, in each instance, reassigned to\nschools as segregated as the schools in which they were previously enrolled. Thus, as Mr. Anliot testified,\nvaluable opportunities to further desegregation have been lost by the district. Of the remaining two schools, in\neach case the proportionate decline in black enrollment is the result of an increase in the enrollment of Asian and\nHispanic students and not due to any increase in the proportion of caucasian students or to any program initiated\nas a part of the voluntary plan. It is therefore clear that Dr. Foster's observation is correct and that no school\nwhich contained a proportion of black students in excess of 90% before 1977 has been desegregated as a result\nof the district's efforts to date.\nThe number and proportion of black pupils in these overwhelmingly segregated schools has declined only slightly\nover the period. In 1977, 107,619 black students or 69% of the 155,706 black students enrolled in the district\nattended schools containing a proportion of black students in excess of 90%. In 1980, 92,997 black students or\n66% of the total were enrolled in such schools. Thus today as in 1977 over two-thirds of all the black public\nschool students in Philadelphia attend schools that are racially isolated containing proportions of black students\nin excess of 90%. (See TABLE'S I and II.)\nDISCUSSION\n175 As we have indicated, the narrow issue presently before us is that of whether the Commission's determination \n*175 that there has been insufficient progress toward the desegregation of Philadelphia's public schools as the\nresult of efforts pursuant to the 1976 Voluntary Plan is adequately supported by the evidence of record. It is\nworthy of note that each of the litigants for the most part accepts the evidence adduced by the other. Each, of\ncourse, disputes the other's conclusions.\nThe school district does not contend that the Commission has, through its aggregate statistics premised on each\nof the three definitions, misrepresented the number of schools that have become desegregated since 1977 or the\nnumber of students in those schools. Neither does the Commission contest that the multitude of programs to\nwhich Dr. Hanusey made detailed reference have been created pursuant to the voluntary plan, are presently\nfunctioning at various locations throughout the City, and are providing valuable educational opportunities for the\nschool children of Philadelphia. In this regard we note that this Court was impressed, as indeed were some of the\nCommission's witnesses, with Dr. Hanusey's and his staff's sincerity and evident desire to do all that is possible\nwithin the constraints imposed by the Board of Education and the physical characteristics of the district to effect\ndesegregation.\nThe question before us, however, is not whether the district has tried but whether, when the distribution of\nstudents of various races in the district's schools is viewed as a whole, its efforts have succeeded or are likely in\nthe future to succeed. As to this issue it seems to us to matter little whether we employ the disrict's 1978\ndefinition, demonstrating progress on the order of 10%, or the Commission's two definitions under which the\ndistrict is shown to have increased the number of desegregated schools and pupils in those schools by\n\n176 approximately 3%. We note in this regard, however, *176 that if the choice of definitions were significant it is clear\nthat the applicable definition would be the one in effect at the time of our July 1, 1977 Order in this case, the\nCommission's 1968 definition. On this record, containing the opinions of experts and experienced employees of\nthe Commission to the effect that betterment of neither 3% nor 10% compares favorably with what has been\naccomplished in similar districts elsewhere or represents all that can be realistically expected of the School\nDistrict of Philadelphia, we are unwilling to substitute our judgment finally for that of the Commission to the effect\nthat the progress under the voluntary plan has thus far been insufficient.\nWe are particularly troubled by the testimony of Dr. Foster that the voluntary plan has entirely failed to accomplish\nthe desegregation of those schools which, prior to the implementation of the plan, contained an overwhelming\nproportion of black students; our reexamination of the enrollment data provided by the school district and\nsummarized in finding four above convinces us that Dr. Foster is quite correct.\nWe are in complete argreement with Dr. Foster that a fundamental purpose of any well-conceived desegregation\neffort must be to desegregate the identifiably black schools in the district and to diminish to the extent possible\nthe racial isolation of black public school students. Indeed our Supreme Court has written that the evil to be\naddressed by the Commission is precisely that presented by the now well-established proposition \"that the\neducation offered pupils in all-Negro or substantially all-Negro schools is inherently inferior to that offered in\nintegrated schools.\" Philadelphia Human Relations Commission v. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 175, 233\nA.2d 290, 299-300 (1967); see Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). See also James C. Coleman\n177 et al., Equality of*177Educational Opportunity (The Coleman Report), United States Office of Education (1966)\n(predominantly Negro schools are qualitatively inferior to their white and integrated counterparts in terms of\nstudent achievement, professional staff experience and credentials, texts and libraries, and availability of such\nacademic extracurricular activities as school newspapers and debating societies).\nThe district must not be content with and we will not grant our imprimatur to a desegregation effort which,\nhowever successful in desegregating schools which formerly contained all or nearly all white students, is\nunsuccessful in accomplishing the desegregation of schools which contain all or nearly all black students. In the\ndesegregation of predominantly black schools it is clear that voluntary methods have proven to be insufficient.\nOne powerful weapon in the arsenal of desegregation methods which, although recommended by its staff, the\nBoard of Education has steadfastly refused to employ but which would directly ameliorate this failing is the pairing\nand combining of the students of neighboring schools where such combination will further desegregation. We\nhave suggested on several occasions that such pairings be accomplished. See Pennsylvania Human Relations\nCommission v. Philadelphia School District, 30 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 644, 650, 374 A.2d 1014, 1017 (1977)\n(concurring and dissenting opinion of ROGERS, J.); Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School\nDistrict of Philadelphia, 23 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 312, 352 A.2d 200 (1976). The instant record supports no\nconclusion other than the necessity and advisability of the combination of those schools specified in the proposed\nresolution of Dr. Hanusey dated May 27, 1980. In addition, on this record there is no justification suggested or\n178 apparent for the continued refusal of the *178 Board of Education to reassign pupils of closed schools so as to\nfurther the desegregation effort.\nNotwithstanding the serious failings of the 1976 plan, we are not prepared to compel the district to abandon the\nvoluntary efforts in view of the short time they have been employed, the not insignificant improvements they\nseem to have effected and the hopeful predictions of some of those who testified. We remain mindful of the great\ndifficulties, unique among the school districts in this Commonwealth, faced by Philadelphia in its attempt to\naccomplish an acceptable degree of racial balance in its public schools. Indeed, as the Commission's witnesses\nconcede, the complete desegregation of the district's schools, in the light of the geographic and demographic\nproblems, may not be feasible without the necessity of transporting students over distances and for periods of\ntime which would endanger their well being. The Commission has long conceded that no child should be required\nto be on the school bus longer than forty-five minutes one way to or from school.\nAt the suggestion of Dr. Crain we have, with the following results, subjected the enrollment data provided by the\ndistrict to the calculations which constitute the Desegregation Index. In 1977 the average black student in the\nPhiladelphia School District attended a school that contained a proportion of white students of 9.3%. Since the\ndistrict as a whole contained 32% white students in 1977 and since implicit in the Index is the assumption that a\n\nschool district is completely desegregated when the average student is enrolled in a school whose racial\ncomposition perfectly reflects the racial composition of the district as a whole, the School District of Philadelphia\nin 1977 had already travelled 29% [9.3% (actual proportion of white students) divided by 32% (maximum\n179 proportion of white students)] of the distance toward complete *179 desegregation. In 1980, after approximately\none school year of voluntary efforts pursuant to the 1976 plan, the average black student in the Philadelphia\npublic schools attended a school which contained a proportion of white students of 11.64%. Since the enrollment\nof white students in the district as a whole declined to 28.8% during the period from 1977 to 1980, the district has\nnow travelled 40% [11.64% (actual proportion of white students (divided by 28.8% (maximum proportion of white\nstudents)] of the distance toward complete desegregation.\nWhile we do not suggest that these figures ought to supplant the definition dependant statistics produced by the\nCommission, the calculations just reviewed do help to place the 3% absolute gain in desegregated schools in\nsome perspective and to indicate that the voluntary plan has not been without effect worthy of reasonable\ncontinued support. However, it is equally clear that even with regard to the predominantly white schools that have\nprimarily benefited from the district's voluntary efforts, a great deal of progress remains to be effected and that\nthe possibility of additional gains is completely dependent on the district's level of financial commitment to the\nmany exciting programs now in their infancy. As we have indicated, Dr. Hanusey was unable at the time of the\nhearings in this case, to inform the Court as to the funding available for the voluntary plan for the year 1981-1982\nand of course we have no information on that or the projects for the year 1982-1983. Dr. Hanusey testified that he\nrequired $14,000,000 combined federal and local funding for 1981-1982.\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion we decide, as have other courts faced with the same issue and comparable facts, that a\n180 desegregation plan which leaves unaffected a substantial *180 number of racially identifiable schools containing\na high proportion of black students is insufficient especially where it appears that the employment of such\ntraditional desegregation methods as pairing and clustering would accomplish a rapid and significant decrease in\nthe racial isolation of black students. See Miller v. Board of Education of Gadsden, Alabama, 482 F.2d 1234 (5th\nCir. 1973); Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashville, Tennessee, 463 F.2d 732 (6th Cir.\n1972); Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 448 F.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1971); Allen v. Board of Public Instruction\nof Broward County, Florida, 432 F.2d 362 (5th Cir. 1970). However, we conclude that the school district's\nvoluntary desegregation program has, in addition to educational merit, effected the desegregation of some of the\ndistrict's schools and that significant additional gains are likely if the district maintains its financial commitment to\nthe program so that we will not grant the Commission's application that an entirely new plan with mandatory\nelements, presumably in replacement of the Voluntary Plan, be submitted; but we will direct the School District to\nmodify its plan to achieve more comprehensive desegregation.\nAccordingly we enter the following\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 15th day of April, 1982, we order that the School District of Philadelphia shall modify its 1976\nVoluntary Desegregation Plan to correct racial imbalance, as measured by the Pennsylvania Human Relations\nCommission's new (1979) definition of a segregated school, suggesting that in so doing serious consideration be\ngiven to the following:\n(1) the pairing of elementary schools recommended by Associate Superintendent Hanusey and his staff by\nproposed resolution appearing as Exhibit D-15 in this record; and\n181 *181 (2) the reassignment of pupils affected by school closings in a fashion which will promote desegregation\nrather than perpetuate segregation.\nSuch modifications shall be submitted to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission on or before July 1,\n1982.\n\nThis court shall retain jurisdiction until further order of the court.\nJudge PALLADINO did not participate in the decision in this case.\nTABLE I\nSCHOOLS WITH GREATER THAN 90% BLACK\nPOPULATION AS OF 11/01/77\nName                        # of Black Students\nFranklin B.

No evidence\non this issue was adduced and we do not know, for example, the relative numbers of black and white children\nthat have been reassigned or must be transported beyond their neighborhood schools as a result of efforts\npursuant to the plan or whether any such children have thereby suffered ill-effects. However, we share the\nconcern of the expert witnesses who have testified, as well as other commentators and the courts of other\n\njurisdictions, that a remedial desegregation plan which shifts the whole of the burden of the remedy onto black\nchildren is both inequitable and ineffective. This criticism is particularly addressed to plans which involve the\nwholesale reassignment of black students to formerly all or nearly all white schools without a corresponding\nmovement of white students to formerly all or nearly all black schools. See Evans v. Buchanan, 582 F.2d 750,\n760-761 (3d Cir. 1978). The deleterious effect such a plan may have on the pupils reassigned was described by\nthe court in the leading case of Brice v. Landis, 314 F. Supp. 974 (N.D. Cal: 1969): \nThe minority children are placed in a position of what may be described as second-class pupils. White pupils,\nrealizing that they are permitted to attend their own neighborhood schools as usual, may come to regard\nthemselves as `natives' and to resent the Negro children bussed into the white schools every school day as\nintruding `foreigners'. . . . This undesirable result will not be nearly so likely if the white children themselves\nrealize that some of their number are also required to play the same role at Negro neighborhood schools.\nId. at 978.

McCunney, 651 F.2d 183 (3d Cir. 1981) (\"In their new schools plaintiffs may risk social\nostracism . . . as well as the rancor of the residents of the community to which they travel\"); Lee v. Chambers\nCounty Board of Education, 533 F.2d 132 (5th Cir. 1976) (equitable allocation of the transportation burden is\nparticularly important in considering a voluntary desegregation plan); Taylor, Summary of Cases and Legal Issues\nin School Desegregation, 19 Howard Law Journal 24, 25 (1975).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Airy Neighbors, Inc.\nOPINION BY JUDGE WILKINSON, JR., July 1, 1977:\nAfter nine years, through the combined efforts of the School District of Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Education, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, and the Intervenors in this case, as\nwell as many other dedicated and concerned citizens of Philadelphia, this Court has before it a voluntary plan for\n646 the desegration of the Philadelphia public schools. We believe that this plan may well *646 be the \"light at the\nend of the tunnel.\" We hope that it is.\nInitially it should be stated here and constantly kept in mind that the segregation to be corrected in the\nPhiladelphia public schools results from the existence of residential areas in which identifiable racial groups\npredominate. It does not result from a deliberate design by the School District. And, as was stated by Judge\nROGERS after 3 days of public hearings in Philadelphia, \"[W]e are unable to conclude that the District has\ndeliberately created or preserved a dual school system so as to give the matter constitutional proportions.\" \nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. School District of Philadelphia, 23 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 312,\n326, 352 A.2d 200, 208 (1976). Judge ROGERS' opinion sets forth the history of this case and the problems it\npresents, and the plan before us is the plan submitted pursuant to Judge ROGERS' Order.\nNo effort will be made to summarize the plan. Suffice it to say that it is built around a new magnet school program\nand permits students and their parents to select the school to attend as long as the choice is consistent with the\ndesegregation of the system. It has been submitted to and approved by the Pennsylvania Department of\nEducation as sound from an educational point of view, with that Department expressing reservations, however, as\nto the prospects for success of the plan as a tool for desegregation. The plan has also been submitted to the\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission. The heart of the objection of the Pennsylvania Human Relations\nCommission to the plan is two-fold. The first is that the plan is entirely voluntary and does not initially contain any\n647 enforced desegregation. The other is that there is no express provision in the plan for enforced *647\ndesegregation if the voluntary plan fails. We can well understand and appreciate the doubts expressed by the\nDepartment of Education and the apprehension of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, but this\nCourt is not prepared to order the public schools of Philadelphia to pair specific schools or to bus specific\nstudents until those charged with the responsibility of administering the schools have had a reasonable\nopportunity to implement a plan which they feel will accomplish desegregation with a minimum of disruption and a\nmaximum of educational value.\n\nIt should be noted that the School District of Philadelphia is not segregated within the prohibitions of the decisions\nof the Federal Courts. Decisions, therefore, by the Federal Courts and plans fashioned by federal authorities to\ncure the ills created by deliberate segregation are not appropriate here. In a manner of speaking, it might be said\nthat the School District of Philadelphia became segregated by action of the people on a voluntary basis by their\nselection of their neighborhood of residence. It does not seem inappropriate, therefore, to attempt to achieve\ndesegregation by the equally voluntary action of the people in the selection of the schools their children will\nattend.\nAll parties here agree that if this plan is approved the School District of Philadelphia should have the school year\n1977-1978 to develop the plan in detail and that it should implement the actual desegregation of its schools in\naccordance with this plan beginning in September of 1978. The School District of Philadelphia believes that a\nreasonable time to test the plan would be 18 months, i.e., until February of 1980 and we agree. If at that time,\nhowever, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission concludes that the plan is not accomplishing the\ndesegregation required by Pennsylvania law, it can then petition this Court for such action as it deems\nappropriate.\n648 *648 Accordingly, we will enter the following\nORDER\nNow, July 1, 1977, the Petition for Enforcement is denied and the School District of Philadelphia is ordered to\nproceed with the detailed development and implementation of the July 1976 School District of Philadelphia\nDesegregation Plan, to be initiated in September of 1978. In the event that by February 1980, the Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Commission determines the plan is not accomplishing desegregation as required by\nPennsylvania law, this Court retains jurisdiction for such further action as it then deems appropriate.\nCONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION BY JUDGE ROGERS:\nThe Philadelphia School District's Plan to accomplish the cure of serious conditions of racial segregation is based\non the hope that its educational innovations will induce students voluntarily to enroll in the District's schools\nwithout regard to race. I have no quarrel with the majority's general approval of the Plan because the\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission, commendably in my view, also generally approves the Plan and\nFederal funding seems to be in prospect.\nThe Commission originally had fourteen specific objections to the School District's Plan. Eleven of these\nobjections have been resolved by discussion between the parties. The five remaining Commission objections are:\n1. The Plan is based entirely on the voluntary participation of students in the program elements to\n649 be offered by the District and contains no contingency plan for desegregation by *649 involuntary\nreassignment should the voluntary plan fail.\n2. The Plan fails to reassign students who attend schools in contiguous school attendance areas\nby redrawing attendance boundary lines, pairing, or any other means so as to guarantee that\nsome measure of desegregation is accomplished during the first year of the Plan's operation.\n3. The Plan fails to include a system of controls to be exercised by the District to guarantee that\nstudents will be selected for each program element and site to insure a non-segregated racial mix\nof participants.\n4. A number of the program elements proposed by the District offer only part-time desegregated\neducational experience.\n5. The Plan proposes to exempt large numbers of schools without providing adequate justification\nas required by this Court's Order.\n\nIn my opinion, we should require the School Board's Plan to make provisions for meeting the Commission's\n650 objection No. 3 and, to the limited extent hereinafter mentioned, objection No. 2.[1] The *650 Commission's\nobjection No. 2 is, in my opinion, very important. In our opinion in Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v.\nSchool District of Philadelphia, 23 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 312, 352 A.2d 200 (1976), we listed examples of\nPhiladelphia elementary schools where wide variations in racial composition existed in schools in the same\nDistrict Planning Areas. At the hearing on the Commission's present Petition for Enforcement the Commission\ngave evidence that upwards of forty elementary schools could be paired or, by redrawing attendance boundaries,\nmight be provided with an integrated student body. The School District presented reasons why in the cases of\nsome of these schools the Commission's suggestion would present difficulties. The record also discloses,\nhowever, that eight elementary schools had been studied by the District's staff on order of the Superintendent\nand that the staff's study demonstrated how those eight schools could be integrated. The Board voted on whether\nthe staff's Plan should be implemented. The eight elementary schools proposed by the staff to be paired were\nCatherine (33% black) with Mitchell (96% black); Girard (23% black) with McDaniel (98% black); Howe (92%\nblack) with Lowell (6% black); and Sheppard (5% black) with Fairhill (43.6% black). The School Board by a tie\nvote rejected the staff's recommendation, apparently in pursuance of a determination that its Plan would contain\nno involuntary elements whatsoever. I would dismiss the Petition for Enforcement only on condition that the\nSchool District agree to meet the Commission's objection No. 3 and implement its staff's Plan for pairing of the\neight elementary schools hereinbefore named.\n[1] The Commission's objection No. 1 is, in my view, unnecessary because this Court will retain jurisdiction and if\nthe voluntary plan does not work, we can act on future applications for enforcement by the Commission. The\nCommission's objection No. 4 raises a novel question, so far as this writer is aware; that is, that of whether under\nthe statute students must be in an integrated class every hour of every school day. We would not jeopardize the\nsubstantial agreements achieved between the parties by embarking on a consideration of this question at this\ntime. The Commission's objection No. 5 draws to our attention that in earlier orders we have said that the District\nshould, as a part of its plan, provide written justification in each instance in which it proposes not to desegregate\na school. Since we imposed this requirement, we may excuse the Board's failure to comply. We should not delay\nthe earliest implementation of the plan by insisting on this requirement.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Shane Creamer,\nAttorney General, for appellee.\nOPINION BY JUDGE WILKINSON, August 17, 1972:\nThis Court has before it five cases in which the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission has ordered a\nschool district to submit a plan to achieve racial balance in its public schools. In all instances, the school district\n\nhas appealed, assigning one or more of the following reasons on which it requests this Court to reverse the order\nof the Commission:\n1. There is no finding of a de jure segregation nor is there any evidence to support such a finding.\n2. The standards used by the Commission in determining that there was de facto segregation are arbitrary and\ncapricious.\n3. The Commission may not direct the filing of a plan which the School Board cannot finance.\n4. The Commission may not file an order unless it has conducted investigations, conferences, conciliation, and\npersuasion prior to conducting a hearing on a complaint filed against the school district.\n5. The Commission may not order a plan to be filed to include employment practices designed to achieve racially\nbalanced staff without an allegation in the complaint that present employment practices are discriminatory.\nThe first two arguments have been put to rest in Pennsylvania by the opinions and orders in Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Commission v. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A. 2d 290 (1967), and the very recent\n285 case of Balsbaugh v. Rowland, 447 Pa. 423, 290 A. 2d 85 (1972).[1] It is unfortunate that the appellants *285 did\nnot have the benefit of Justice POMEROY'S able opinion in Balsbaugh when they prepared their appeals in the\ninstant cases, for most of their fundamental arguments are discussed at length and discarded in that opinion. In \nBalsbaugh, the Harrisburg City School District was putting into effect a daily cross-city busing plan that would\ntransport approximately 28% of its pupils to achieve a racial balance within 10% of the racial composition of the\ntotal public school population. The plan would cost upwards of one million dollars annually. Plaintiffs there sought\nan injunction against the implementation of the plan, alleging that the District adopted the plan under duress from\nthe Human Relations Commission, and that the plan violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment of the Constitution of the United States. Speaking for a unanimous court, with all Justices sitting,\nJustice POMEROY clearly sets forth the distinction between any alleged constitutional duty of the State to\nprovide busing to relieve de facto segregation as distinguished from de jure segregation and the right of the\nHuman Relations Commission to require busing under authority granted to it by the legislature. \"If assignment\nand busing of pupils may be acceptable, and indeed required, methods of attempting to overcome racial\nsegregation where that condition is historically of de jure origin, it would indeed be anomalous if they were\nnevertheless considered to be unreasonable, discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional methods when\nvoluntarily employed by a state to rectify an imbalance which is the product of de facto segregation.\" Balsbaugh\nv. Rowland, supra, at 438, 290 A. 2d at 93. The opinion states that the Commission is within its statutory authority\nto require such a plan. \". . . the Human Relations Commission is well within its rights in ordering that steps be\n286 taken to eliminate racial segregation found to exist within the student population of *286 any school district. . . . In\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A. 2d 290 (1967), we\nlaid to rest arguments to the effect that the Human Relations Act did not permit the Commission to require school\nboards to take corrective measures to overcome de facto racial segregation within their districts.\" 447 Pa. at\n432-33, 290 A. 2d at 90.\nThe argument that the requirement of the Commission for the plan to achieve racial balance within 30% of the\nracial composition of the total school population is arbitrary and capricious fails completely in light of the decision\nin Balsbaugh where the plan required racial balance within 10%. The argument of appellants that classroom\nfacilities with 55% black and 45% white could not be said to be in any substantial racial imbalance, even though\nthe District has a 9% black and 91% white school population, is one that must be made to the Human Relations\nCommission and not to this Court. The Commission is the body that has been designated by the legislature to\ndetermine such matters. Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43\nP.S. § 955. Justice ROBERTS, in Chester, discusses at length the Commission's jurisdiction and the history of\nthe legislation. He concludes: \"Moreover, having expressed its findings and goals in an early section, the\nLegislature undoubtedly envisioned a case-by-case approach to the elimination of racial imbalance in public\nschools. Most observers agree that when courts are forced to devise and supervise programs whose goal is the\nelimination of racial imbalance they are acting in an area alien to their expertise. These observers would prefer to\nsee de facto segregation attacked by the community itself utilizing other organs of the government. The Human\nRelations Commission, whose function is to work with the parties to the dispute in an attempt to alleviate the\n\n287 source of *287 the friction through `conference, conciliation and persuasion,' and whose procedure is\nconsiderably more flexible than the courts, is, as the Legislature recognized, better equipped to deal with this\nproblem than the courts. `In each case, the interests protected by adherence to neighborhood attendance zones\nmust be weighed against the substantiality of the racial imbalance in the community's schools. An agency such\nas the Human Relations Commission is best equipped to make these difficult judgments, and flexible enough to\nenter appropriate remedial orders'.\" Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester School District,\nsupra, at 179, 233 A. 2d at 301-02.\nThe Court is very sympathetic with the position of the School Districts that it is futile to require the districts to\nsubmit plans that would meet the minimum requirements of the Commission when the increased costs incident to\nsuch plans, i.e., busing, installation of cafeterias, lunch programs, etc., are beyond the financial capabilities of the\nDistricts. However, the costs cannot be determined with any accuracy until a minimum acceptable plan is\nsubmitted. Whether it can be implemented within the financial capabilities of the Districts, together with such\nsupport from other sources as can be generated and with any realignment of priorities, will have to be determined\nat that time.\nA corollary argument regarding the futility of filing a plan as ordered is raised directly by Philadelphia but would\nseem to be applicable to most metropolitan areas. This argument is that a suitable practical plan cannot be\ndevised without the inclusion of the adjoining suburban districts. The power of the Federal courts to order such\ninclusion under the rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution is now in litigation through the Federal courts\nand presumably will be decided by the United States Supreme Court within the foreseeable future. We will not\n288 comment on this litigation. Once again, we *288 must emphasize that the cases before this Court turn on the\nauthority of the Human Relations Commission, not on rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. During\nthe conference that followed the arguments of the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh cases, a plan for Philadelphia was\npresented by that School District \"in skeleton form\" and appeared on its face to be worthy of further development.\nNo such plan was received from Pittsburgh. When these cases are remanded for further action by the\nCommission, consistent with this opinion, it is hoped that the Philadelphia School District can \"flesh out\" this plan\nand have its practicability and acceptability determined by the Commission. At that time, if the Commission so\nelects, it can be determined whether the Commission has authority to order the adjoining districts to participate.\nConsiderable argument is made that the Commission did not make suitable investigations, hold sufficient\nconferences, and attempt earnestly enough to conciliate after filing the complaints and before holding the\nhearings. This argument would have more weight if any substantial facts were in dispute or if it appeared that\nconciliation would have been profitable. With particular regard to Pittsburgh which presses this argument,\nfollowing the conference held by this Court on March 14, 1972, that District was not in a position to submit any\nnew position. A study of all the records does not disclose that the Commission acted on the basis of insufficient\ninformation or failed to attempt to resolve the matters in an amicable rather than in an adversary manner.\nThe one argument that will require all of these cases to be returned to the Commission for either a revision of the\norder or further proceedings to attempt to justify the order is the provision that a plan be submitted to \"include\n289 procedures to affirmatively and effectively recruit and assign an integrated staff at all *289 levels for all schools.\"\nSuch a requirement is incorporated in all of the orders by virtue of its inclusion as paragraph four in the May 15,\n1968 Recommended Elements of a School Desegregation Plan. It was more specifically included in the order in\nthe New Castle. Uniontown, and New Kensington-Arnold cases by providing: \"By September 1973 achieve a goal\nthat the percent black professional and the percent black nonprofessional staff be in proportion to the percentage\nblack population of the community of the school district. Failure to achieve said goal will not be considered a\nviolation of this decree provided the district produces evidence of a good faith effort to reach said goal.\"\nThe Commission did not include in any complaint any specific allegation of discrimination in hiring practices. The\ndefendant School Districts were not called upon or put on notice to produce any evidence as to their recruitment\nand hiring practices or any effort or lack of effort which they may have made to recruit black professional and\nnon-professional staff. The Commission's reply is that it is basing its order on de facto racial imbalance in\nprofessional and non-professional staff and not on de jure imbalance. It asserts that it has authority to correct de\nfacto racial imbalance in the staff by analogy to its authority to correct de facto segregation of pupils within a\ndistrict. We quote the identical language that appears in the Commission's briefs in New Castle, Uniontown, and\n\nNew Kensington-Arnold: \"Since, therefore, by analogy, the School Board has the affirmative duty to overcome the\neffects of de facto segregation, it also has the affirmative duty to overcome racial imbalance in professional and\nnon-professional staff in order to achieve that atmosphere of racial equality which promotes minority achievement\n290 as well as respect and understanding by the majority.\" Any analogy between de facto segregation of pupils *290\nwithin a district based on the percentage of black and white student population of the district and de facto\nimbalance of the staff within the district based on either the pupil population or the general population of the\ndistrict is superficial indeed. The staff is not drawn from the pupil or general population of the district. Its selection\nis based on both ability and availability. No case has been drawn to our attention which holds that a district is\npermitted to have a plan for the affirmative recruitment of minority staff under the Pennsylvania Human Relations\nAct, much less that such an affirmative recruitment plan may be required. See Romain v. Middletown Area School\nDistrict, 1 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 419, 275 A. 2d 400 (1971).\nIn Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Secretary of Labor, 442 F. 2d 159 (3rd Cir. 1971), the Third\nCircuit Court of Appeals upheld the Philadelphia Plan for affirmative recruitment of employees of contractors for\nbuilding projects supported by Federal funds. However, the court discussed at considerable length the possibility\nthat such a program was violative of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act but stated: \"If the Plan was adopted\npursuant to a valid exercise of presidential power its provisions would, of course, control over local law.\" 442 F.\n2d at 166. After discussing the provisions of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, the opinion, in a footnote,\npoints out: \"Moreover, we do not know how the Pennsylvania courts or the Pennsylvania Human Relations\nCommission would react to a scheme of `benign' quota hiring.\" 442 F. 2d at 166 n. 14.\nThis Court is not prepared to approve an order that requires a school district to adopt an affirmative recruitment\nprogram for professional and non-professional staff on a record completely barren of testimony concerning the\ncause of the present employment ratio or whether there is any need for a change in the employment practices of\nthe district.\n291 *291 Without minimizing any of the many difficult problems presented to the Human Relations Commission and\nthe School District in all of these cases, the big problem relates to busing 00 Who is to decide when and how to\n97\nbus school children from their \"neighborhood schools\"? The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Chester, with the\nthen Chief Justice and the present Chief Justice dissenting, reversing the Superior Court and the Dauphin County\nCourt, has established the law of Pennsylvania to be that unless and until the Human Relations Act is changed by\nthe legislature, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission has the authority to order busing to correct de\nfacto segregation.\nAccording, we enter the following\nORDER\nNOW, August 17, 1972, the records in these cases are remanded to the Pennsylvania Human Relations\nCommission for it, after such further conferences, hearings, conciliation and persuasion, if any, as it feels\nappropriate, to modify the orders in accordance with this opinion.\nDISSENTING OPINION BY JUDGE MENCER:\nI respectfully dissent. I do not believe that the records in these cases support a finding of a de facto segregation\n292 [1] and, in the absence of this prerequisite, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (Commission) *292\nis without the authority to order these school districts to submit plans to achieve racial balance in its public\nschools. The Commission does not assert that there exists any de jure racial segregation in these cases. In 1954,\nthe Supreme Court of the United States held that it is unconstitutional for a state to enforce the segregation of\nschool pupils in a racial basis. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954). It\nseems to me that the common impression which developed from that decision was that the Court had ordered\nthe racial integration of the public schools. Even some courts seemed to miss the distinction between legal\ndesegregation and physical integration.\n\nIn 1971, the Supreme Court again enunciated that \"racial imbalance\" and \"segregation\" are not synonymous\nterms and that the Federal Constitution does not require that every school reflect the racial composition of the\nschool system as a whole. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28\nL. Ed. 2d 554,rehearing denied,403 U.S. 912, 91 S. Ct. 2200, 2201, 29 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1971).\n[2]\nIn 1967, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act  permitted the\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission to require school boards to take corrective measures to overcome \nde facto racial segregation within their districts. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester School\nDistrict, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A. 2d 290 (1967). In Chester, unlike here, there was no serious question as to the\nexistence of de facto segregation. Justice ROBERT'S opinion in that case stated that \"[a]t the time of the hearing\nthe racial composition of the schools in question was:\n293 *293\n                 White     Negro     Total   %  Negro\nDouglass          1        527        528        99+\nDewey-Mann        0        823        823       100\nFranklin         10       1018       1028        99\nLincoln          69        490        559        87\nWashington        0        782        782       100\nWatts             0        344        344       100\n\"Clearly, the above figures, which are not disputed, satisfy any definition of de facto segregation.\" 427 Pa. at 178,\n233 A. 2d at 301. I certainly agree with that inescapable conclusion, but here we have figures that just as clearly\n[3]\ndo not satisfy any definition of de facto segregation.\nThis then brings a consideration of these cases to the vital question. What constitutes de facto segregation? It is\nthe Commission's determination, that the ratio of 55% blacks and 45% whites in certain schools constitutes de\n[4]\nfacto segregation, which compels me to dissent.\n294 *294 Our Supreme Court has stated in significant footnotes in both Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission\nv. Chester School District, 427 Pa. at 158-59 n.1, 233 A. 2d at 291 n.-1, and Balsbaugh v. Rowland, 447 Pa. 423,\n434-35 n.6, 290 A. 2d 85, 91 n.6 (1972), that \"[a]s the courts below observed, de facto segregation `remains\nundefined in its full concept,' yet at the same time it is a meaningful term. 85 Dauph. 18, 25, [40 D. & C. 2d 493,\n501, aff'd mem., 209 Pa. Superior Ct. 37,] 224 A. 2d 811, 820 (1966). According to one student of the problem,\n`de facto segregation may be defined simply as the racial imbalance in schools which occurs when the number of\nNegroes in a compact Negro area becomes so great that drawing school zone boundaries on a geographical\nbasis causes the great majority of Negro children to attend schools which are overwhelmingly Negro in\npopulation.' Kaplan, Segregation Litigation and the Schools 00 Part I: The New Rochelle Experience, 58 Nw. L.\n97\nRev. 1, 2 (1963). See also, United States v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 372 F. 2d 836, 878 n. 92 (5th Cir.\n1966), for other definitions of the term.\"\nHere in three of these cases (Uniontown, New Castle, and New Kensington-Arnold), we do not have a great\nmajority of black children attending schools which are overwhelmingly black in population. Here we do have the\nschool districts protesting and denying the finding of the Human Relations Commission that de facto segregation\nexists in their schools. It is exactly this feature which removes these cases from the controlling ambit of\nBalsbaugh v. Rowland, supra, where Justice POMEROY was careful to point out that Balsbaugh was being\ndecided on the basis that the existence of de facto segregation was not challenged. These significant words\nappear in Balsbaugh: \"It is to be noted that so far as the record before us shows, no challenge of any kind has\n295 been made by appellants to the legality or *295 propriety of the directive of the Commission that steps be taken\nto create a better racial balance, nor was this directive contested by the school Board. . . .\n\". . . Although the Plan may have been prompted by the Commission order to do away with school segregation.\n. . .\" 447 Pa. at 433, 290 A. 2d at 90-1. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nIn Balsbaugh, de facto segregation was conceded to exist whereas, in certain of the present cases, de facto\nsegregation is denied. We must examine the records to ascertain whether de facto segregation has been\nestablished by substantial evidence, because, if it has not, the Human Relations Commission cannot direct the\nappellants to submit a plan.\nThe Commission's findings of fact stating the variable standard of \"disproportionate racial concentration\", applied\nby the Commission to the ratios of black and white pupils found in these public schools to determine that they\nwere segregated, are unsupported by evidence as findings of fact and erroneous as conclusions of law. The\nrecords are completely devoid of any evidence whatsoever that the Commission's standard (that a segregated\nschool is one in which \"the percent of Negro pupils is less than or more than thirty (30%) percent of the percent of\n[5]\nNegro pupils in schools of the same grade span of a school district\" ) properly defines segregation.\nQuestioned at the hearing in the Philadelphia case about this standard, which was first promulgated in \nRecommended Elements of a School Desegregation Plan by the Commission jointly with the Department of\nPublic Instruction, the Commission's witness referred merely to the opinion of those who participated in devising\n296 the formula that it seemed fair and reasonable to them. *296 This witness also lamely noted how the\nCommission's standard differed from Massachusetts' unfair, flat 50% formula and California's and New Jersey's\nunfair, though judicially defined, \"substantial\" imbalance standard. There was no testimony as to why\nmeasurement of racial imbalance by the racial composition of the school population of school districts is\nappropriate at all. Indeed, the Commission's witness admitted that it was without \"scientific basis\".\nPlainly, the Human Relations Commission merely adopted a general policy in its Recommended Elements and\nthen applied that policy to the public schools in these proceedings without considering the particular conditions of\nschool segregation in the various schools. The Superior Court condemned such administrative practice in Aizen\nv. Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, 163 Pa. Superior Ct. 305, 316, 60 A. 2d 443, 449 (1948): \"A\npreviously adopted policy may not furnish the sole basis for the commission's action in a particular case. Policy\ncannot be made a substitute for evidence in a proceeding before it. The conditions of a particular case may\nrequire the reversal of any administrative policy. No declared regulatory policy by the commission may preclude\nthe future exercise of its functions as an administrative agency of the legislature. Such a declaration of policy\ncannot be a finality regardless of circumstances.\"\nAs a conclusion of law, the Commission's variable standard of disproportionate racial concentration is equally\narbitrary and capricious and surely contrary to law. Measurement of racial imbalance solely by the public school\npopulation of a single school district leads to patently arbitrary results. As pointed out before, the Commission\nfound the Uniontown schools to have de facto racial segregation where one school out of fifteen had 55.9%\n297 blacks but found that a junior high school in *297 Philadelphia with 84% blacks was not racially segregated.\nI have no quarrel with the quotations of law from Chester and Balsbaugh which the majority calls forth. However,\neach and every one is founded upon an undisputed or unchallenged existence of de facto segregation. It is true\nthat, once de facto segregation is established, it is the Commission's, not the judiciary's, province to deal with the\nproblem and to exercise its expertise to eliminate the existing segregation. Accordingly, I do differ with the\nmajority's statement that \"[t]he argument of appellants that classroom facilities with 55% black and 45% white\ncould not be said to be in any substantial racial imbalance, even though the District has a 9% black and 91%\nwhite school population, is one that must be made to the Human Relations Commission and not to this Court.\"\nTherefore, I conclude that these records do not support, by substantial evidence, a finding of de facto segregation\nor discrimination by the school districts. I would sustain these appeals and vacate the Commission's orders\ndirecting the school districts here to submit plans to eliminate alleged racial imbalance.\n[1] Inasmuch as the other cases involving desegregation of school districts are usually referred to by the name of\nthe locale or the district, this case is frequently referred to as the Harrisburg case.\n[1] In the case of the School District of Pittsburgh v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, No. 568\nCommonwealth Docket 1971, the appellant concedes that de facto racial segregation exists but persuasively\ncontends that the Commission ignored the statutory procedural requirements mandating that the Commission\n\nendeavor to eliminate the practice complained of by conference, conciliation and persuasion prior to conducting a\nhearing on a complaint filed against the School District of Pittsburgh.\n[2] Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. § 951, et seq.\n[3] In Uniontown Area School District, one elementary school, East End, has 55.9% blacks in its student body.\nThe Park School has 36% blacks and none of the other fourteen schools in the district has more than 17.4%\nblacks in its student body, although there are 89 pupils in Special Education, of which 23.5% were blacks. On\nSeptember 22, 1970, the New Castle Area School District operated fourteen schools and eleven of these had no\nmore than 15.7% of their student bodies black. The percentages of blacks in the remaining three schools were\n23.1%, 47.2% and 58.2%. A similar situation exists in the New Kensington-Arnold School District where eight of\ntheir ten schools had no more than 13.8% of their student body black. The percentages of blacks in the remaining\ntwo schools were 21.3% and 55.8%.\n[4] Contrast this with the conclusion reached by the Commission relative to the Philadelphia School District for\nthe school year 1970-71, when 60.5% of the Philadelphia public school population was black, where the\nCommission found as findings of fact that a Philadelphia senior high school 72% black was not segregated, a\nPhiladelphia junior high school, 84% black was not segregated and a Philadelphia elementary school 77% black \nwas not segregated.\n[5] Finding of Fact No. 10, Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v.

Include beginning and completion dates for each desegregation step, together with the\nprojected desegregation results of each step in terms of the number and identity of Respondent's\nschools and the number of the Respondent's pupils changed from a status of racial imbalance to\nracial balance.\n2. Avoid transportation of pupils for lengths of time or distance that risk their health or significantly\nimpinge on their education process. If the results of this stipulation is that racial imbalance will not\nbe corrected in all schools, this plan must include justification acceptable to the Commission for\nthis modification.\n3. Not place an undue share of the participation in reassignment or transportation on one racial\ngroup.\n\"D. That any decentralization plan adopted or implemented by Respondent be consistent with this\nAmended Final Order.\n\"E. That Respondent shall forthwith cease and desist from opening any new school without a\nracially-balanced pupil enrollment.\n\"F. That Respondent in applying for approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Education of any\nsteps in school building projects shall provide the\n316 *316 Commission with the following data concerning the facility:\n1. The location of the building site.\n2. Pupil capacity.\n3. Attendance area boundaries.\n4. Projected enrollment by race.\n\"G. That Respondent report to the Commission as follows:\n\n1. By February 1 of each year, for as long as the Commission shall require it to comply with this\nOrder, the pupil enrollment by race of each school building in Respondent's district, on report\nforms to be provided by the Commission.\n2. By June 1 and December 1 of each year, for as long as the Commission shall require it to\ncomply with this Order, a progress status regarding its curricular desegregation programs.\n\"H. That the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission shall retain jurisdiction in this matter and\nreserves the right to amend this Amended Final Order from time to time to ensure that the public\nschool enrollment within The School District of Philadelphia will continue to remain racially-\nbalanced.\"\nAs may be supposed, the history of the efforts of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission to require the\nSchool District of Philadelphia to submit a plan and timetable for curing racial imbalance, and the efforts of the\nDistrict, faced with enormous demographical, geographical, financial, social and political problems, to respond, is\nlong. It begins with our Supreme Court's decision in Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester\nSchool District, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A.2d 290 (1967), that the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, Act of October\n27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. § 951 et seq. proscribed de facto segregation of black students in the\n317 public schools of Pennsylvania, and that the Act empowers *317 the Commission to order school districts to cure\nsuch conditions. The Commission and the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction (now the Department of\nEducation) on May 15, 1968 jointly prepared and thereafter used a document called \"Recommended Elements of\na School Desegregation Plan\" referred to in its Amended Final Order to the District. See Pennsylvania Human\nRelations Commission v. Norristown Area School District, 20 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 555, 342 A.2d 464 (1975).\nThe \"Recommended Elements\" are as follows:\n\"1. Does the desegregation plan indicate the projected racial composition of each elementary and\nand secondary school attendance area and the racial composition of the total staff of each\nbuilding as of the completion dates of each step?\n\"2. Does the desegregation plan identify the location of proposed school building construction\nsites?\n\"3. How nearly does the desegregation plan bring the per cent Negro pupils in each building to\nwithin 30% of the per cent Negro pupils among the buildings of the same grade span?\n\"4. Does the desegregation plan include procedures to affirmatively and effectively recruit and\nassign an integrated staff at all levels for all schools?\n\"5. Does the desegregation plan correct any untoward concentrations of professional or non-\nprofessional Negro staff in any buildings?\n\"6. Does the desegregation plan equally match the services of its professional staff and program\nwith the educational needs of each school building?\n\"7. Does the desegregation plan include plans for in-service training of staff to meet the needs and\nproblems incident to the implementation of desegregation plans?\n\"8. Does the desegregation plan include steps to include intergroup education programming and\n318 the inclusion of the contributions of Negroes and *318 other racial and ethnic groups in the history\ncourses about Pennsylvania and the United States?\n\"9. Does the desegregation plan include a timetable indicating deadline dates by which each step\nwill be completed? Are these dates as early as possible?\n\"10. Does the desegregation plan indicate involvement of the community in its development and\nimplementation?\n\n\"11. Is the desegregation plan consistent with the Long Range Developmental Plan submitted to\nthe Department of Public Instruction?\"\nIn the year 1968 the Commission and the School District commenced discussions of what should and could be\ndone in the Philadelphia District. The District filed a plan in June of 1969 which the Commission disapproved.\nNeither this plan nor the Commission's reasons for disapproving it are in the record. The Commission ultimately\nconducted hearings and issued the order requiring the submission of a further plan and timetable, which order\nwas the subject of our deliberations in Philadelphia School District v. Human Relations Commission, supra. The\nAmended Final Order of September 25, 1972 followed.\nThe District, which did not appeal our decision in Philadelphia School District v. Pennsylvania Human Relations\n319 Commission, supra,[1] failed to submit a plan, and on August 6, 1973 the commission filed its first petition for \n*319 enforcement of the Amended Final Order. The District filed an answer, the Commission filed a reply, we\nconducted an evidentiary hearing and on November 14, 1973, by Judge WILKINSON, ordered the District to\nsubmit a plan and timetable for implementation to the Commission on or before February 15, 1974. On that date\nthe District filed a plan proposing in immediate future the busing of students from seven predominantly black\nschools and one predominantly white school to six other schools, the possibility of other such operations in the\nfuture and other measures, including the pairing of a \"significant number of adjacent schools . . . which have a\npotential for pairing.\" There is evidence in the record that the number of schools which the District thought\ncapable of being paired might be as low as fifteen and as high as forty. The Commission disapproved this plan\nand on April 2, 1974 filed a second petition for enforcement, requesting, inter alia, that this Court appoint a\nmaster. We conducted further hearings and on June 2, 1974 appointed the Honorable David H. Kurtzman,\nformerly Secretary of Public Instruction of Pennsylvania, as an expert to review the District's plan of February 15,\n1974, and to report his recommendations on or before September 1, 1974. On August 29, 1974, Dr. Kurtzman\nfiled his report, recommending that the District should be required as a first step to reassign and bus pupils in a\ndesignated portion of the City and to use this experience as a model for other areas in the future. Judge\nWILKINSON conducted a further hearing on September 24, 1974 at which both the Commission and the District\npresented evidence in opposition to Dr. Kurtzman's proposal.\nOn October 1, 1974, Judge WILKINSON ordered both the Commission and the District to prepare final definitive\nplans and to submit them to the Court on or before January 31, 1975. On the request of both parties this time\nwas extended until July 7, 1975, and within that time both parties filed plans which we will describe later in this\nopinion.\n320 *320 We conducted four days of hearing in August, 1975, at which each the Commission and the School District\nexplained its plan and produced objections to the other's proposal. Interested members of the public were also\nheard, most of whom expressed opposition to the Commission's plan. Before the hearings we permitted\nintervention of the members of a group of persons calling themselves Citizens Committee for Neighborhood\nSchools and at the time of hearing we permitted the intervention of a number of other interested individuals.\nIn December 1975, the full court heard the argument of counsel for the Commission, the District and the two\ngroups of individuals.\nThe facts we find to be established by the record, which, for the convenience of counsel in their review of this\nopinion we give seriatim, are as follows:\n1. The School District of Philadelphia is coterminous with the City limits of Philadelphia. The City has an area of\n129 square miles. The distance from the extreme northeastern boundary line to the extreme southwestern is\nabout 24 miles. The City extends inland from the west bank of the Delaware River for distances up to 10 miles.\n2. During the 1974-1975 school year, according to latest complete statistics in the record, 266,500 persons were\nenrolled in the public schools. The Roman Catholic parochial school system educates an additional\napproximately 100,000 students, most of whom are white.\n\n3. Of the 266,500 students of the District, 164,558, or 61.7 percent, are black and 88,480, or 33.2 percent, are\nwhite. The balance, 5.1 percent, are the minorities for which the District keeps records 00 American Indian,\n97\nOriental and Spanish Surnamed.\n4. The categories of public schools are Senior and Vocational High Schools; Junior High Schools and Middle\nSchools; Elementary Schools and Special Schools.\n321 5. The Senior High Schools which accommodate 61,373 students are 59.4 percent black and 37.4 percent *321\nwhite. The Vocational Technical High Schools which have 5,786 students are 67.1 percent black and 27.8\npercent white. The Junior High School students number 35,869, of which 70.9 percent are black and 22.5 percent\nare white. The Middle Schools with 18,046 students are 63 percent black and 35.8 percent white. The school\npopulation of the Elementary Schools is 141,598, of which 59.9 percent are black and 34.1 percent are white.\nThe Special Schools which have 3,828 pupils are 68.2 percent black and 26.3 percent white.\n6. The name Junior High School is given to schools generally accommodating students from grade 7 through 9.\nThe term Middle School is applied to schools accommodating students from grade 5 through 8 or 9. High Schools\ngenerally conduct classes from the 9th to the 12th grade. There is great variation in the grade structures in\nparticular Elementary Schools. It may be from Kindergarten to 8, Kindergarten to 7, Kindergarten to 6,\nKindergarten to 5, Kindergarten to 4, or Kindergarten to 1. One school, Lamberton, teaches students from\nKindergarten through the 11th grade.\n7. There appear to be 30 High Schools, four Vocational Technical High Schools, 27 Junior High Schools, 17\nMiddle Schools, and 198 Elementary Schools, and 18 Special Schools. There are, therefore, 294 schools in the\nsystem.\n8. The Philadelphia School District is divided into eight numbered administrative districts. The District is further\ndivided into 21 so-called School Planning Areas, bearing designation by letters from A to U. The eight\nadministrative districts and the 21 School Planning Areas are shown by this map.\n322 *322\n323 *323 9. Administrative District 8, popularly referred to as the Northeast, is seven miles long and between five and\nsix miles wide. There are 39,812 students in Administrative District 8, 95.5 percent of which are white and 3.5\npercent are black. In Administrative District 1, located at the extreme Southwestern corner of the school district,\nthere are 41,488 students, of whom 90.2 percent are black and 9.6 percent are white. In District 4, adjoining\nDistrict 1 on the North, there are 37,987 students, of which 95.5 percent are black and four percent are white. In\nDistrict 2, adjoining District 1 on the East, there are 28,248 students, 83.3 percent black and 10.2 percent white.\nStated in general terms, the Northeastern section of the City is overwhelmingly white and the Southwestern part\nis overwhelmingly black.\n10. The proportions of black and white students in the other administrative districts are as follows:\nDistrict 3, with 18,372 students, 54.3 percent black, 38.4 percent white.\nDistrict 5, with 29,457 students, 41.3 percent black, 32 percent white, and 26.5 percent Spanish\nsurname. District 6, with 40,855 students, 80.1 percent black, 18.8 percent white; and\nDistrict 7, 30,321 students, 33.5 percent black, seven percent Spanish surname, and 58.7 percent\nwhite.\n11. The total number of students and the percentage of black and white students in the twenty-one School\nPlanning Areas are as follows:\n     Area            Total Students   Percentage Black\n      A                 15,024              98.3\n\n      B                 11,119              87.9\n      C                 11,687              98.1\n      D                 17,012              79.3\n      E                  6,090              87.\n      F                 27,012              91.2\n      G                  6,938              32.7\n      H                 21,104              99.\n324 *324      I                 14,925              92.1\n      J                  1,759              45.8\n      K                 11,239              85.2\n      L                 12,403              47.1\n      M                 13,952              37.3\n      N                 14,434              72.3\n      O                 13,635              47.1\n      P                 12,318               0.9\n      Q                  6,883               1.4\n      R                  8,760               5.8\n      S                  9,449               3.3\n      T                 12,473              14.4\n      U                 11,664              22.5\n12. The percentage of black pupils in grades 1 through 9, excluding Kindergarten and exceptional pupils, is 63.3.\nThe percentage of black pupils in grades 10 through 12 was 60.6. Applying the Commission's 30 percent\nstandard of Recommended Element No. 3 to those percentages, we find that any elementary, middle or junior\nhigh school falling within a range of 82.3 to 44.3 percent black, and any senior high school falling within a range\nof 78.8 to 42.4 percent black would be \"desegregated\" by the Commission's guidelines.\n13. Of the total of 242 elementary, middle and junior high schools, 106 have more than 90 percent black pupils.\nAn additional six of those schools have more than 82.3 percent of black pupils.\n14. Fifty elementary, junior and middle high schools have more than 90 percent white pupils. An additional 25\nelementary, junior and middle schools have more than 60 percent white pupils.\n15. Of the 34 senior and vocational technical high schools, eleven are more than 90 percent black and an\nadditional two have more than 78.8 percent of black pupils.\n16. Three high schools, all located in the Northeast, have more than 90 percent white pupils.\n325 *325 17. Including special schools, of which 11 of 18 appear to be in a state of racial imbalance, at least 211 of\nthe District's 294 schools do not conform with the Commission's Recommended Element No. 3.\n18. The District is and has been in a condition of financial stringency, if not distress. With budgets near\n$500,000,000, it had a deficit of $7,500,000 for 1974-75. It will have a deficit of about $25,000,000 for 1975-76\nand projects a deficit of about $108,500,000 for 1976-77. The Board being appointed, the District must depend\nfor local financing on City Council.\n19. There is no direct evidence in this case that the District has by arranging attendance areas or otherwise\ncreated or fostered racial imbalance in its schools. While there is evidence that some efforts have been made to\nachieve mobility of races in the District by the establishment of magnet schools and optional programs, there is\nnothing in the record establishing that the District has transported pupils for purposes of improving the conditions\nof racial imbalance. The District now buses about 16,000 public school students for other reasons.\n20. The District's staff is integrated.\n21. There are juvenile gangs in Philadelphia which are hostile to outsiders venturing into their neighborhoods.\nPupils transported to such neighborhoods could be the objects of gang hostility.\n\nThe Commission would have us take a stern view of the District's lack of progress toward curing racial imbalance\nsince 1968. While there has doubtless been intransigeance on the part of the District, the Commission must\nshare the blame for the unfruitfulness of the discussions between the parties and of this litigation. The\nCommission has always insisted that any plan submitted by the District must bring all of the Philadelphia schools\nwithin its Recommended Element No. 3. The Final Amended Order which it here seeks to enforce states this\n326 requirement as an imperative. The District's efforts to comply with the Commission's Orders were undoubtedly \n*326 inhibited by what it believed to be the impossibility of preparing a plan that could receive approval. The\nwisdom of Judge WILKINSON'S order that the Commission itself suggest a plan is demonstrated by the fact that\nthe Commission now concedes that 11 schools, with about 15,000 students almost all white, in School Planning\nAreas P and Q, should not, because of travel time, be integrated and that 23 additional schools, 18 of which are\n[1]\nblack and five white, in other School Planning Areas must remain segregated for the same reason.  While the\nnumber of 34 schools is small compared to the 294 schools in the District, it is not small compared to the\nproposal of the Commission's plan that 39,483 elementary pupils be reassigned and that 33,853 elementary\npupils and 19,806 middle and junior high school pupils be transported.\nWe next comment, as our finding numbered 19 implies, that we are unable to conclude that the District has\ndeliberately created or preserved a dual school system so as to give the matter constitutional proportions. No\nparents of pupils have joined the Commission as complainants. Three persons representing civil rights groups\ncalled for greater integration of the city schools. Two of these witnesses entertained reservations about the\nCommission's plan and one had not studied the plan.\nWe come finally to descriptions and consideration of the plans before us, two of which we ordered and four of\nwhich have been volunteered:\nSCHOOL DISTRICT PLAN\nWe can be very brief concerning the School District's proposal. It says (it now appears correctly) that full\ncompliance with this Court's direction that its plan comply with the Commission's Recommended Element No. 3 is\n327 a physical impossibility. It records its financial condition of large deficits and the refusal of financial aid by *327\nthe Commonwealth as rendering compliance with any order requiring the expenditure of \"millions of dollars\"\nimpossible. It proposes, if the Commonwealth provides complete financing, the creation of a Metropolitan School\nDistrict which would include Philadelphia and ten adjacent school districts in Montgomery and Delaware\nCounties. These joined districts would provide about 60,000 white pupils to be integrated with the predominantly\nblack pupils in Administrative Districts 1, 4 and 6, and would make it possible to achieve an almost even number\nof black and white pupils in adjacent areas of Philadelphia.\nThe District, of course, concedes that its proposal, which to our knowledge has been a subject of public\ndiscussion but without action for at least ten years, is beyond the District's power to implement and the\nCommission's power to order. It is just as certainly beyond our power to compel and must be rejected. State\npolicy seems thus far to be that Philadelphia should single-handedly struggle with the State's statute mandating\nthe integration of the public schools, whatever the difficulties.\nVOLUNTEERED PLANS\nTobyann Boonin, a member of the Philadelphia School Board, has submitted a proposal for Programmatic\nDesegregation Academies, each specializing in a particular discipline 00 art, english, foreign languages,\n97\nmathematics, music, physical and health education, science and social studies. It is proposed that pupils will be\ntransported to these centers, which would be desegregated, on each school day, thus providing every pupil one\nday each week in an integrated school environment.\nSchool Board member Augustus Baxter also advocates a Metropolitan District. He has additionally proposed as\naids to integration within Philadelphia's boundaries the closing of nonfire-resistant schools, the pairing of schools,\nthe desegregation of high schools, new Parkway Program clusters, new intensive learning programs, busing,\n\n328 closing *328 underutilized schools, and the creation of two new junior high schools. These efforts it is claimed\nwould desegregate 130 or 44.2 percent of the District's schools. Mr. Baxter also espouses the academy proposal\nsuggested by Mrs. Boonin as a further aid to integration.\nThe Citizens Committee for the Preservation of Neighborhood Schools representing some intervenors proposes\na program of voluntary busing and an increase in the number of magnet and trade schools located at various\nplaces in the city to which pupils would be attracted, presumably in integrated numbers.\nOther individual intervenors have proposed the formation of a 158 person committee of parents, students,\nrepresentatives of various institutions and intervenors which, under the supervision of this court, would first\ndevelop guidelines and later formulate a plan for integration.\nEach of these plans appears to have some merit. Directors Boonin and Baxter's proposals have the additional\nquality of suggesting immediate action on the part of the Board.\nNone of these volunteered plans have been approved by the District Board of Education and none have been\nsubmitted to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. It is clear from the actions of the Commission with\nrespect to the District's plan filed in 1974 and to Dr. Kurtzman's proposal that it would not consider these\nmeasures as compliance with the law, and we are unwilling as yet to substitute our judgment for the\nCommission's.\nWe commit these plans to the Board of Education and the Commission for their consideration.\nTHE COMMISSION'S PLAN\nThe Commission engaged the services of an expert in school integration, Dr. Gordon Foster. The Commission\n329 instructed Dr. Foster to propose a means whereby the schools might be integrated as its guidelines provide *329\nwithout requiring any child to be transported to school one way for more than forty-five minutes. So far as this\nrecord shows, the Commission had never suggested to the District that it might employ such a limitation on travel\nin producing plans in response to the Commission's order.\nDr. Foster divided the District into ten clusters as follows:\n    Cluster 1       SPAs    A and G\n    Cluster 2       SPA     B\n    Cluster 3       SPAs    C, J, K, O\n    Cluster 4       SPA     D\n    Cluster 5       SPAs    E, F, L and an eastern portion\n                            of T\n    Cluster 6       SPAs    H and portions of S and T\n    Cluster 7       SPAs    I, U\n    Cluster 8       SPAs    M and a portion of T\n    Cluster 9       SPAs    N, R and portions of Q and S\n    Cluster 10      SPA     P and a portion of Q\nEleven schools in Cluster 10, being all those in SPA P and all but one in SPA Q are unaffected by Dr. Foster's\nproposal and remain almost entirely white. The plan, as we have earlier noted, proposes for the balance of the\nDistrict the reassignment of 39,483 elementary pupils and the busing of 33,853 elementary and 19,806 junior and\nmiddle school students.\nKindergarten students, students attending nine city-wide schools and exceptional students requiring special\nphysical facilities are not reassigned. No busing is proposed for high school pupils, all of whom would use public\ntransportation.\n\nThe schools within Clusters are grouped, and pupils within groups are then assigned together to middle and\njunior high schools and then to high schools in so-called feeder patterns.\n330 Dr. Foster attempted to eliminate as many of the schools as possible from the category of what he calls *330\nracially identifiable. He defines a racially identifiable school as any which offends the Commission's\nRecommended Element No. 3 00 that is, as any elementary or junior high or middle school having less than 82.3\n97\npercent of black students or more than 44.3 percent of white students, and any senior high school having more\nthan 78.8 percent of black students or more than 42.4 percent of white students. He observes, using this\ndefinition, that his plan reduces the number of racially identifiable schools from 216 (of which 124 are black) at\npresent to 34. In fact, however, the percentage of black students in many of the presently so-called racially\nidentifiable black schools is reduced very little. There are presently about 136 schools with 70 to 100 percent\nblack pupils and 142 schools with 60 to 100 percent black pupils. After implementation of Dr. Foster's proposal\nthere would still remain 125 schools with 70 to about 83 percent black and 168 schools with 60 to about 83\npercent black students.\nThe District contends that a school with as many as three-fourths black pupils remains racially identifiably black.\nIt says, with some justice, that Dr. Foster's plan requires vast movement of pupils at great cost in money and\ninconvenience with little practical effect on the black schools claimed to have been integrated.\nDr. Foster testified that in his opinion the annual cost of transporting 53,659 pupils as he proposes by contracting\nwith others would be about $4,000,000. If the District chose to operate its own system he estimates that an initial\noutlay of $5,000,000 for equipment would be required. The District's director of transportation says that the\nannual cost for contracted services would be $8,200,000, and that the initial cost if the District should purchase\nbuses using staggered starts would be $17,800,000. If staggered starts were not approved, and there are good\nreasons for not employing this practice, the initial cost would be $35,000,000. The District presently transports\n331 about 12,000 nonpublic school pupils, *331 16,000 public school pupils and provides public transportation costs\nfor an additional 12,000, all at an approximate annual cost of $7,000,000.\nDr. Foster concedes that, because of time constraints, his plan is merely a pupil reassignment proposal without\nregard to community involvement, educational benefit, and future building concerns, all matters required by the\nCommission's Recommended Elements to be considered in any plan. Further, due again to time constraints and\nin addition to the form in which some of the data was supplied, Dr. Foster was compelled to calculate travel time\nof pupils only from the school of their enrollment to that to which he proposes that they should be transported.\nSince the District now buses about 16,000 public school pupils either because of the distance from their\nresidence to school or for overcrowding, it is probable that many of the pupils Dr. Foster proposes transporting\nwill be required to spend more than the 45 minutes the Commission agrees should be the longest time any pupil\nshould be asked to use in school travel.\nWe conclude that we should not respond to the prayers of the Commission's petitions for enforcement by\ndirecting the District to implement Dr. Foster's proposal because it is without educational content or community\ncontribution and, in our judgment, requires more to be done than its practical effect on the 115 schools having 90\npercent or more black students justifies.\nOn the other hand, there is evidence in this record which compels the conclusion that there is racial imbalance in\nthe Philadelphia schools which can be corrected. The School Planning Areas, as we understand them, were\nintended as divisions of this huge district convenient for the study and provision of physical facilities. The\nfollowing information culled from Dr. Foster's report could easily lead to the conclusion that planning for racial\nintegration was either not included in, or given little attention, when the Board considered the needs of its School\nPlanning Areas.\n332 *332\n                          SCHOOL PLANNING AREA D\n                           1974-75 ENROLLMENTS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Grade                                  Design   Use\n Schools             Organiz.

The\nDistrict has learned from these proceedings that the Commission will approve a plan in which not every school\nmust conform to its Recommended Element No. 3, and that the Commission accepts the fact that there are\nlimitations on the amount of time children may be required to spend traveling to and from school. The District\nshould understand, however, that improvement of the racial imbalance of its schools is necessary and that its\naccomplishment requires the expenditure of funds, if necessary at the expense of other programs. The\nCommission has now recognized that a rigid adherence to its a priori standards is not always possible. It will, we\ntrust, also understand from the evidence at our hearings that the District's physical problems are unique in this\nCommonwealth. So also are its financial troubles.\nExcept for the fact that the Commission seems to have refused to consider any proposal which failed to integrate\nevery school of the District according to its standard, we would unhesitatingly state that it has, by producing Dr.\nFoster's pupil reassignment plan, performed a service beyond the call of its responsibility. We do not hesitate to\nsay that that plan has been most helpful to us and should be helpful to the Board and the community in their\nfurther consideration of what can be done.\nWe have mentioned that the onus of preparing a plan for integration is on the District. Since we are unwilling to\nenforce the Commission's order by implementing any of the proposals which have been exhibited to us, we are\ncompelled reluctantly to refer the matter back to the District for the preparation of a new plan for the\nCommission's and, if necessary, our consideration. We expect, and will require the District to make a realistic and\n342 effective proposal to integrate its schools; we expect *342 the Commission in reviewing the District's submission\nto do so in practical, not doctrinaire, fashion.\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 13th day of February, 1976, the respondent School District of Philadelphia is Ordered to prepare\nand submit to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission for its review and approval a definitive plan and\ntimetable for the practical cure in its schools of conditions of racial imbalance as defined by Recommended\nElement No. 3 of the Commission; provided that such plan shall in general not require pupils transported as the\nresult of reassignment under the plan to be on a bus more than forty-five minutes a day each way to or from\nschool. The plan shall include written justification for each instance in which it is proposed that a school shall\nremain racially imbalanced.\n\nThe District shall submit the plan and timetable to the Commission on or before July 1, 1976 and at the same\ntime submit the same to the Department of Education of the Commonwealth for its recommendations as to\neducational content.\nThe Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission is Ordered promptly to review the plan and timetable and, after\ndiscussion with the District and, if indicated, jointly with the District and the Department of Education, approve or\ndisapprove the same, in whole or part. If the Commission finds the plan and timetable to be objectionable, in\nwhole or part, it shall state such objections in writing and with particularity.\nWe retain jurisdiction, to be exercised in the event there is an appeal by the District should the Commission\ndisapprove the plan and timetable submitted hereunder or if there is further petition of the Commission for\nenforcement of its order if the District shall fail to comply with this Order by failing to file a plan and timetable or\nshall file a plan and timetable which the Commission does not finally approve.\n[1] \"Racially imbalanced schools are those having a percent Negro enrollment less than or more than 30% of the\npercent Negro pupils among the buildings of the same grade span.\n[1] Other school districts which were parties to that litigation did appeal and our orders were affirmed in \nUniontown School District v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 455 Pa. 52, 313 A.2d 156 (1973). The\nSupreme Court held that Recommended Element number 3 requiring that desegregation plans should bring the\npercent of black pupils in each building to within thirty percent of the percent of black students in buildings of the\nsame grade span was within the power of the Commission to enact.\n[1] Our numbers here and elsewhere in this opinion may prove not to be exact; they are the best we can do with\nthe welter of sometimes unreconcilable data in the record.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

It began on October 8, 1970, \nwhen the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) initiated a complaint against \nthe School District of Philadelphia (the school district) in which the PHRC alleged that the \nschool district was unlawfully 129*129 segregated in violation of the Pennsylvania Human \nRelations Act (PHRA).[1] After investigation and hearing, the PHRC determined that the \nschool district was unlawfully segregated by race, and ordered the school district to submit \na desegregation plan. The school district appealed and Commonwealth Court affirmed the \norder, as modified, and remanded the matter to the PHRC for appropriate modification. On \nSeptember 5, 1972, the PHRC issued an amended final order that incorporated the court-\nmandated modifications. All subsequent litigation has involved enforcement proceedings \npertaining to the September 5, 1972 order. \nThe ensuing twenty-three years of litigation, including appeals, resulted in fourteen \npublished opinions by Commonwealth Court. Then, in the twenty-fifth year of the litigation, \non November 3, 1995, the Commonwealth Court ordered the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, Governor Ridge, the City of Philadelphia, and Mayor Rendell to be joined as \nadditional respondents, in order to adjudicate the funding of remedies. PHRC v. School \nDistrict of Philadelphia, 667 A.2d 1173, 1188 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995). \nFollowing the joinder, pleadings were filed in Commonwealth Court, discovery was \nconducted, and hearings were held. Concurrently with those proceedings, the \nCommonwealth and the governor filed an application for preliminary relief with this court, \nasking it to assume plenary jurisdiction of this matter. On July 3, 1996, we did so, ordering \nthe Commonwealth Court judge to conclude all hearings within sixty days, to focus the \nhearings on the issue of desegregation, \"the original issue in this matter,\" and to issue a \nfinal opinion within thirty days of the conclusion of the hearings then taking place. On \nAugust 20, 1996, Commonwealth Court's opinion and a purported order were filed with this \ncourt. The Commonwealth and the governor filed a motion to vacate the order. This court, \non September 10, 1996, vacated the August 20, 1996 Commonwealth Court order, and \ndivested Commonwealth Court of jurisdiction and stayed all further proceedings 130*130 in \nthat court while this court exercised plenary jurisdiction over the matter. \nOn January 28, 1997, this court ordered briefing of the following issues: (1) whether the \nlower court erred in its order of November 3, 1995 joining the Commonwealth and the \ngovernor, the City of Philadelphia and the mayor, as additional respondents; (2) whether the \nlower court exceeded its authority in fashioning remedies to redress de facto segregation in \nthe school district; and (3) whether an enforcement action is to be treated in Commonwealth \nCourt's original or appellate jurisdiction. \nThe salient issue is the propriety of joining the Commonwealth, the governor, the City of \nPhiladelphia, and the mayor. This depends, essentially, on whether the proceedings in \nCommonwealth Court were in its original or its appellate jurisdiction. \nThe PHRC argues that the enforcement proceedings in Commonwealth Court were in its \noriginal, not its appellate, jurisdiction. PHRC acknowledges that PHRC v. Scranton School \nDistrict, 510 Pa. 247, 507 A.2d 369 (1986), held that enforcement petitions filed in \n\nCommonwealth Court do not involve matters \"originally commenced\" in that court, and \ntherefore no appeal as of right exists under 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a).[2] Nevertheless, PHRC \nargues that enforcement proceedings, though not originally commenced in the PHRC, are \nyet within the original jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court. Thus, the PHRC distinguishes \nbetween proceedings \"originally commenced\" in the court for purposes of appealability \nunder 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a), and proceedings which are within the court's \"original \njurisdiction,\" arguing that the two are not coextensive. Some proceedings, PHRC claims, \nare in Commonwealth 131*131 Court's original jurisdiction though not originally commenced \nin that court, including enforcement proceedings, for example. \nThis distinction is meaningful in determining what rules of procedure govern the \nproceedings. The Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, for example, provide: \nRULE 103. SCOPE OF RULES \nThese rules govern practice and procedure in the Supreme Court, the Superior Court and \nthe Commonwealth Court, including appeals to such courts from lower courts and the \nprocedure for direct review in such courts of determinations of government units. \n.... \nRULE 106. ORIGINAL JURISDICTION MATTERS \nUnless otherwise prescribed by these rules the practice and procedure in matters brought \nbefore an appellate court within its original jurisdiction shall be in accordance with the \nappropriate general rules applicable to practice and procedure in the courts of common \npleas, so far as they may be applied. \nPa.R.A.P. 103 and 106. \nIt is apparent from Rule 106 that if an enforcement proceeding is within the original \njurisdiction of Commonwealth Court, then the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure apply, \nwhereas if an enforcement proceeding is a direct review of the determination of a \ngovernment unit, such as PHRC, then the Rules of Appellate Procedure govern the \nproceeding in Commonwealth Court. Although PHRC's argument seems to be logically \nsound — that \"originally commenced\" in 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a) for appealability purposes \nneed not be identical to \"original jurisdiction\" in the Rules of Appellate Procedure for \ndetermining which rules of procedure apply — we nevertheless reject the argument. The \nPHRC admits that there is confusion in this area of procedure. The brief of amici curiae \nspeaking for the General Assembly of Pennsylvania goes 132*132 further, arguing that \nPHRC v. Scranton, supra, and Pennsylvania Department of Aging v. Lindberg, 503 Pa. 423, \n469 A.2d 1012 (1983) compel the conclusion that this enforcement proceeding falls in the \nCommonwealth Court's appellate jurisdiction, noting: \"To decide otherwise would be \nuntenable. There must be symmetry between [the Pennsylvania Supreme] Court's allocatur \nand direct appeal jurisdiction and the Commonwealth Court's appellate and original \njurisdiction or confusion would reign among practitioners.\" We agree that this is so. PHRC \nv. Scranton, supra, held that enforcement proceedings, in the terminology of 42 Pa.C.S. § \n723(a), are not originally commenced in the Commonwealth Court, but did not decide \nwhether enforcement proceedings are within the \"original jurisdiction\" of Commonwealth \n\nCourt in the terminology of 42 Pa.C.S. § 761. We now hold that the nature of enforcement \nproceedings as well as a desirable consistency warrant the conclusion that just as \nenforcement proceedings are not originally commenced in Commonwealth Court, they are \nalso in the appellate, rather than the original, jurisdiction of the court. \nIt then follows that the rules of appellate procedure, rather than the rules of civil procedure, \ngovern enforcement proceedings in Commonwealth Court. The application of the appellate \nrules is decisive, for the rules of appellate procedure, unlike the rules of civil procedure, do \nnot permit joinder of additional parties. See, e.g., North Cambria Fuel Co. v. DER, 153 \nPa.Cmwlth. 489, 621 A.2d 1155, 1162 n. 12 (1993) aff'd without opinion, 538 Pa. 377, 648 \nA.2d 775 (1994) (EHB lacks authority to allow joinder of third party in appeal of order). \nThe parties to an enforcement proceeding are limited to the parties before the \nadministrative agency. The procedural rules applicable to administrative agencies, the \nGeneral Rules of Administrative Practice and Procedure, 1 Pa.Code, Part II, and 25 \nPa.Code, Chapter 21, do not provide for compulsory joinder of third parties. Since additional \nparties could not have been joined in the proceeding before the PHRC in this case, it was \nan unwarranted encroachment on the 133*133 jurisdiction of the PHRC and an \nunauthorized expansion of an enforcement proceeding for Commonwealth Court to order \nthe joinder of additional parties. \nIn addition to improper joinder of parties, it appears that Commonwealth Court \nmisapprehended the nature and scope of enforcement proceedings. The statutory authority \nfor enforcement and judicial review of a PHRC order does not permit the consideration of \nnew claims not entertained by the PHRC. The procedure is as follows: \nThe complainant, the Attorney General or the [Pennsylvania Human Relations] Commission \nmay secure enforcement of the order of the Commission or other appropriate relief. When \nthe Commission has heard and decided any complaint brought before it, enforcement of its \norder shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint in court, together with a transcript of the \nrecord of the hearings before the Commission.... \n43 P.S. § 960. The language of the statute does not permit the PHRC to discard its own \norder and to seek relief substantially different from what was included in its order binding \nthe school district.[3] The statute does not permit a new claim to be brought, during an \nenforcement proceeding, against an original party nor against an entity which was not a \nparty in the original proceedings before the PHRC.[4] \nThe PHRC entertained no claim against the Commonwealth, the governor, the City of \nPhiladelphia, nor the mayor in its desegregation proceedings culminating in the September \n25, 1972 PHRC order. Commonwealth Court had no basis to 134*134 consider a claim not \nconsidered by the PHRC,[5] let alone the enforcement of an order against strangers to the \nproceedings. Thus it was error for Commonwealth Court to join the Commonwealth, the \ngovernor, the City of Philadelphia, and the mayor as additional respondents. \nThe order of the Commonwealth Court dated November 3, 1995, ordering the joinder of the \nCommonwealth, Governor Ridge, the City of Philadelphia, and Mayor Rendell, is vacated. \n\nWe will remand for such continued enforcement proceedings in Commonwealth Court as \nare consistent with this opinion. \nOrder of Commonwealth Court dated November 3, 1995 vacated. Case remanded for \nfurther enforcement proceedings consistent with this opinion. Jurisdiction relinquished. \nJustice NIGRO files a concurring opinion. \nJustice ZAPPALA concurs in the result. \nNIGRO, Justice, concurring. \nI concur in the result reached by the majority. I write separately, however, because I cannot \nagree that the Commonwealth Court did not have original jurisdiction in this enforcement \nproceeding. In an enforcement proceeding the inquiry is limited to whether the order itself \nwas complied with, not whether the order was properly entered on the merits. Due to its \nunique nature, I would find that an enforcement proceeding falls within the Commonwealth \nCourt's original jurisdiction. Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that, in this case, joinder \nof the Commonwealth, Governor Ridge, the City of Philadelphia, and Mayor Rendell was \nimproper, not only because it infused a new claim into the case but, because joinder of \nthese parties was not necessary for the Commonwealth Court to enforce the Commission's \norder. \n[1] Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. § 951 et seq. \n[2] 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a) provides:  \n§ 723. Appeals from Commonwealth Court \n(a) General rule. — The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of the \nCommonwealth Court entered in any matter which was originally commenced in the Commonwealth Court except an \norder entered in a matter which constitutes an appeal to the Commonwealth Court from another court, a district \njustice or another government unit. \n[3] The statutory authorization of \"other appropriate relief\" does not release the court from its obligation to defer to the \nadministrative order. Rather, to be \"appropriate,\" relief must be tailored to elicit or effectuate compliance with the \nadministrative order; it does not include relief substantially different from that ordered by the PHRC, and certainly \ndoes not include relief against a third party. \n[4] Commonwealth Court determined that a judicial mandate of funding by the state legislature is not a nonjusticiable \npolitical question. PHRC v. School District of Philadelphia, 667 A.2d 1173, 1184 (1995). We need not decide the \nissue, due to our decision to vacate the joinder of the Commonwealth respondents on other grounds. \n[5] Commonwealth Court recognized that \"[t]he issue of funding of remedies ... was never adjudicated or otherwise \ndealt with by the [PHRC]....\" PHRC v. School District of Philadelphia, supra, 667 A.2d at 1178. \n ",

JUSTICE POMEROY, December 4, 1973:\nThe appeals now before us are from the decision of the Commonwealth Court in Philadelphia School District v.\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 6 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 281, 294 A. 2d 410 (1972) in which that\ncourt affirmed orders issued by the Commission to five school districts (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Uniontown, New\nCastle and New Kensington-Arnold) upon a finding by the Commission of a violation by each district of section 5\n[1]\n(i)(1) of the Human Relations Act, Oct. 27, 1955, P.L. 744, as amended, 43 P.S. § 955 (Supp. 1973-74).\nI.\nIn September of 1967, this Court held that under the section of the Human Relations Act set forth in note 1, the\nCommission was empowered to correct de facto segregation occurring in the public schools of this State. \nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A. 2d 290 (1967).\n55 Although we noted at the outset that the term \"de facto segregation\" was not fully defined,[2] we found *55 it\nunnecessary in Chester to state any particular definition because we there observed that \"the . . . figures, which\n[3]\nare not disputed, satisfy any definition of de facto segregation.\"  (Emphasis added.) 427 Pa. at 178. While we\ndid not think that it followed from the absence from the Human Relations Act of any particular definition that the\nGeneral Assembly had unconstitutionally delegated its law-giving power to the Commission, we pointed out that\nthe availability of judicial review under the Administrative Agency Law would \"provide adequate protection . . .\n[s]hould the commission at some future date abuse its authority,\" id., and that in so empowering the Commission\nto act against de facto segregation, \"the Legislature undoubtedly envisioned a case-by-case approach.\" 427 Pa.\nat 179. Since the date of our decision in Chester, the Legislature has not amended the Human Relations Act in a\nmanner which would suggest disagreement, and we therefore persevere in our belief that, indeed, the Human\n[4]\nRelations Act does speak to segregation that does not arise from official policy or acts.\n56\n\n*56 On March 29, 1968, subsequent to Chester, the Human Relations Commission together with the Department\nof Public Instruction adopted through a procedure not elucidated by the records in these appeals a document\nentitled \"Desegregation Guidelines for Public Schools\", which described itself as \"set[ting] forth guidelines for\nschool districts\" and which contained the following paragraph:\n\"1. Segregation as a factor in public education\n\"When any one public school building comes to be viewed as improperly exclusive in fact or in spirit; when it is\nviewed as being reserved for certain community groups; when morale, teacher and pupil motivation and\nachievement are affected by the racial imbalance, the school system is being adversely affected by segregation.\nIn other words, segregation is not an arbitrary numerical relationship of one group to another. Segregation\nbecomes a factor adversely affecting education when an untoward concentration of any racial group in one\nbuilding begins to destroy the functioning of the entire system as a `common school'.\n\"The common school has long been viewed as a basic social instrument in attaining our traditional goals of equal\nopportunity and personal fulfillment. The presence in a single school of children from varied backgrounds is an\nimportant element in the preparation of young people for active participation in the social and political affairs of\nour democracy.\n\"Insofar as possible every school building should reflect in its enrollment a cross section of the entire community.\"\n57 Shortly thereafter, on May 15, 1968, the *57 Commission and the Department of Public Instruction adopted a\ndocument entitled \"Recommended Elements of a School Desegregation Plan\", one of the tests of which was 00\n97\n\"3. How nearly does the desegregation plan bring the percent Negro pupils in each building to within 30% of the\n[5]\npercent Negro pupils among the buildings of the same grade span?\"\n58 *58 In its undertaking to apply these principles to the 634 odd school districts in Pennsylvania, the Commission\nresolved for purposes of administrative manageability to proceed first against those districts (17 in number) in\nwhich any one school building contained more than 80% Negro pupils and in which the permissible deviation\n(30%) was violated. When in the early Spring of 1970 all but two (Philadelphia and Pittsburgh) of these districts\nhad adopted or were in the process of adopting a plan of desegregation acceptable to the Commission, the\nCommission then approached the eight school districts in which any one school building contained more than\n[6]\n50% Negro pupils and in which the permissible deviation was exceeded.  To that end the Commission\nsponsored in June, 1970 a conference at Allenberry, Pennsylvania to which representatives of the school districts\nof New Castle, Uniontown and New Kensington-Arnold, among others, were invited and at which the Commission\nexplained its \"Desegregation Guidelines for Public Schools\" and its \"Recommended Elements of a School\nDesegregation Plan\". The three appellant-school districts, however, failed to submit desegregation plans\n59 acceptable to the Commission. In late 1970 or early 1971, therefore, the *59 Commission issued complaints\nagainst the three individually and, after a hearing in each case, found as a fact that 00\n97\n\"VI. A racially-segregated or racially-imbalanced school is one whose concentration of Negro or white pupils is\ndisproportionate to the enrollment of that particular racial group in all of the schools of the same grade span of a\nschool district.\n\"VII. A disproportionate racial concentration of pupils in a public school consists of a pupil enrollment in which the\npercent of Negro pupils is less than or more than thirty (30%) percent of the percent of the Negro pupils in\nschools of the same grade span of a school district, as defined by the Complainant and Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Education in `Desegregation Guidelines for Public Schools' and `Recommended Elements of a\n[7]\nSchool Desegregation Plan'.\"  Applying that \"fact\" to the statistics of the appellant districts (set out in the\nAppendix to this opinion), the Commission found as a conclusion of law that each district was in violation of\n60 Section 5(i)(1) of the Human Relations Act.[8] Consequently, the Commission entered a final *60 order directing\neach district to \"develop and submit\" a plan and timetable for implementation that would eliminate racial\nimbalance as defined by the Commission.\nThe appeals of New Castle, Uniontown and New Kensington-Arnold were consolidated for decision with similar\n[9]\nappeals taken by Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in the Commonwealth Court,  and the Commission's \"develop\n\nand submit\" orders were affirmed. The court held that the school districts' arguments 00 that a finding of de facto\n97\nsegregation was unwarranted and that the standards employed by the Commission (the 30% test, supra) were\narbitrary and capricious 00 were \"put to rest\" in Chester, supra, and in our more recent decision in Balsbaugh v.\n97\nRowland, 447 Pa. 423, 290 A. 2d 85 (1972). The latter case was read by the Commonwealth Court as approving\nthe very definition involved in these appeals, but with a permissible deviation of 10% instead of 30%. The\nargument against the Commission's definition of racial imbalance, the Commonwealth Court concluded, \"is one\nthat must be made to the Human Relations Commission and not to this Court\". 6 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. at 286.\n61 [10] We granted *61 review at the request of the appellant-school districts and in light of the public importance of\n[11]\nthe issue presented. We now affirm.\nII.\nAll agree that the core issue here is the power of the Commission to adopt its definition of racial imbalance, or,\nput somewhat differently, whether its definition in fact accurately interprets Section 5(i) (1) of the Human\nRelations Act.\nWe begin by observing that we have not decided this question previously. In Chester, as pointed out earlier, we\nfound it unnecessary to adopt any particular definition of what degree of racial imbalance constituted de facto\nsegregation. In Balsbaugh, taxpayers in Harrisburg filed a complaint in equity against the Harrisburg City School\nDistrict, seeking to enjoin the implementation of a desegregation plan drawn up by the school district at the\n62 request of the Human Relations Commission.[12] The Commission was not a party to *62 that action and, as we\nnoted, \"no challenge of any kind has been made by appellants to the legality or propriety of the directive of the\nCommission that steps be taken to create a better racial balance, nor was this directive contested by the School\nBoard\". 447 Pa. at 433. In stead, we viewed the Balsbaugh issue as that of the power of the appellee school\nboard under the Public School Code of 1949 to implement such a plan; we did not there interpret Section 5(i) (1)\nof the Human Relations Act, nor were we called upon to examine the power here asserted by the Commission to\nadopt its definition.\nThe appellant-school districts ask us to say that the Legislature's intention in defining as an \"unlawful\ndiscriminatory practice\" the act of refusing, withholding, or denying \"to any person because of his race . . . either\ndirectly or indirectly, any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges of [a] place of public\naccommodation. . . .\" 43 P.S. 955 (Supp. 1973-74), was not to require that every school building in the\nCommonwealth reflect to a mathematical precision the racial makeup of the school district as a whole. Were that\nin fact the approach required, this Court would have great difficulty in saying that such was or was not the\nLegislature's intention.\nAs the Commission states in its brief, a search of the Human Relations Act for standards useful in defining de\n[13]\nfacto segregation is unavailing; \"none are stated in the Act itself.\"  The Commission's Director of Education, by\n63 his testimony, informs us that the *63 proffered definition of de facto segregation is unique in the United States\nand that it was adopted after consideration and rejection of other definitions of the term in use elsewhere. It will\nbe useful to review those other definitions.\nFederal law: Where segregation is \"de facto\", as distinguished from \"de jure\", the federal constitutional law as\nannounced by the Supreme Court of the United States forbids only intentionally discriminatory acts. Keyes v.\nSchool District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S. Ct. 2886, 37 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1973); Spencer v.\n[14]\nKugler, 404 U.S. 1027, 30 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1972),aff'g326 F. Supp. 1235 (D.N.J. 1971).  It is clear, therefore,\nthat our Human Relations Act reaches segregation not yet remediable under constitutional theories. Congress\n[15]\nhas forbidden federal courts to attempt correction of de facto segregation  by assignment or transportation of\n64 pupils. This statute, of *64 course, has not affected the power of federal courts to remedy unconstitutional (i.e., de\njure) segregation, Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 17-18, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971),\n[16]\nnor does it affect the power of this State to deal with de facto segregation as a matter of state law.\n\nPrior to the recent Keyes [Denver School District] decision requiring that the complainant show affirmative\n[17]\ndiscriminatory action, some federal decisions  had dealt with arguments based on the necessity for achieving\nracial balance. In Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Education, supra, for example, the argument was made\nthat the district court had relied on a mathematical formula or \"norm\" in remedying de jure segregation. The\n65 Supreme Court answered: \"If we were to read the holding of the District Court to require, as a *65 matter of\nsubstantive constitutional right, any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that approach would be\ndisapproved and we would be obliged to reverse. The constitutional command to desegregate schools does not\nmean that every school in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a\nwhole.\" (Emphasis added.) 402 U.S. at 24. In Cisneros, cited supra at note 14, the Fifth Circuit, although of the\nview that the distinction between de facto and de jure was meaningless when Mexican-American and Negro\nschool children attended neighborhood schools which were overwhelmingly minority-populated, refrained from\nadopting any mathematical view of to what extent racial mixing would be required. See also Mapp v. Board of\nEducation of Chattanooga, 477 F. 2d 851, 857 (6th Cir. 1973) (WEICK, J., dissenting: \"There is no provision in\nthe Constitution which can be read as saying that the races must be mixed in each and every school in the\n[18]\nsystem. . . .\").\n66 *66 In Bell v. School City of Gary, Indiana, 213 F. Supp. 819, 829 (N.D. Ind., aff'd, 324 F. 2d 209 (7th Cir. 1963), \n[19]\ncert. denied, 377 U.S. 924, 12 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1964)), a Dr. Max Wolff  testified for plaintiffs and defined a\nsegregated school as \"`any school where the percentage of Negro to white students was one-third greater or\none-third less than the percentage of Negro students to white students in the entire system.'\" The court in Bell\nreplied: \"Dr. Wolff cited no authority for his definition of segregated schools other than himself. Dr. Wolff's\n67 definition of a segregated school may be a good sociological definition, but the Court can find no *67 authority\nwhich would indicate that it is a good legal definition.\" 213 F. Supp. at 829.\nWhile federal courts have so far not found it necessary to adopt any particular definition of de facto segregation,\none district court, in holding that the constitution reaches imbalance caused by residential patterns, observed as\nfollows: \"However, segregation in the sense of racial imbalance, exists in the Springfield school system. While the\nexperts did not agree on what constitutes racial imbalance in general, or in Springfield in particular, it is\nunnecessary to define the term. In light of the ratio of white to non-white in the total population of the City of\nSpringfield [80% white], I do find, however, that a non-white attendance of appreciably more than fifty percent in\nany one school is tantamount to segregation.\" (Emphasis added.) Barksdale v. Springfield School Committee,\n237 F. Supp. 543, 544 (D. Mass., vacated on other grounds,348 F. 2d 261 (1st Cir. 1965)).\nOne distinguished federal jurist, Judge J. Skelly Wright, in his opinion in Hobson v. Hansen, 269 F. Supp. 401\n(D.D.C. 1967),aff'd sub nom. Smuck v. Hobson, 408 F. 2d 175 (D.C. Cir. 1969), wrote as follows: \"In these\nfindings and throughout the opinion . . . `segregation' will denote the state of racial separateness in the schools,\nregardless of cause. For expressing the degree of segregation in Washington schools, the court will call a school\n`predominantly' Negro (or white) if 85% or more of its students are of that race. This cut-off point is relevant to\nevidence adduced by the parties respecting the state of segregation beyond which the education or social\nadvantages attached to integration disappear.\" 269 F. Supp. at 411 n.9.\nMore recently a sociologist from Harvard University, Dr. Thomas F. Pettigrew, gave his views as to integration in \n68 Bradley v. School Board of Richmond, 338 F. Supp. 67, 194 (E.D. Va.),rev'd,462 F. 2d 1058 (4th *68 Cir. 1972),\naff'd per curiam by an equally divided court,412 U.S. 92, 93 S. Ct. 1952, 36 L. Ed. 2d 771 (1973). His testimony\nis thus summarized by the District Court: \"To achieve `integration', in Dr. Pettigrew's terms, one must have the\n`mix plus positive interaction, as we would want to say, between whites and blacks'. Current research indicates\nthat in order to achieve these benefits there is an optimum racial composition which should be sought in each\nschool. Dr. Pettigrew placed this at from 20% to 40% black occupancy. These figures are not all hard and fast\nbarriers, but merely indicate to the racial composition range in which inter-action of a positive sort is the more\nlikely to occur. Social science is not such an exact science that the success or failure of integration depends upon\na few percentage points. The lower level of 20% fixes the general area below which the black component takes\non the characteristic of a token presence. Where only a few black students are in the particular school, there\nsimply are insufficient numbers for them to be represented in most areas of school activities. Such participation\nwould be crucial to the success of integration. The high level of 40% is linked not to the likely behavior of the\n\nstudents so much as it is to the behavior of their parents. When the black population in a school rises\nsubstantially above 40%, it has been Dr. Pettigrew's experience that white students tend to disappear from the\n[20]\nschool entirely at a rapid rate. . . .\"\n69 *69State Law: According to one author,[21] there are twelve states which by policy discourage racial imbalance\nin public schools and six states which enforce that policy in some manner 00 Illinois, Pennsylvania, California,\n97\nMassachusetts, New Jersey and New York.\nThe Legislature in Illinois in its Armstrong Act has mandated its school boards to achieve racial balance through\n[22]\nperiodic review and gerrymandering of neighborhood school attendance zones.  The statute by its terms\nwould seem to preclude transportation of students as a tool in achieving balance. In Tometz v. Board of\nEducation, Waukegan School District No. 61, 39 Ill. 2d 593, 237 N.E. 2d 498 (1968), the Supreme Court of Illinois\nupheld the Act against a claim that the state could not constitutionally make race a factor in drawing school\nboundaries. The court held, however, that while racial balance is a \"paramount consideration\", it was not the sole\nrelevant consideration in adopting a school boundary. It specifically approved the action of the lower court in\nconsidering \"traffic, distance, finance [and] classroom capacity\". 237 N.E. 2d at 505.\n70 In Jackson v. Pasadena City School District, 59 Cal. 2d 876, 31 Cal. Rptr. 606, 382 P. 2d 878 (1963),*70 the\nSupreme Court of California held that an action in which a Negro child complained of being assigned to a\npredominantly Negro neighborhood school would withstand a demurrer, concluding that 00 \"a student under some\n97\ncircumstances would be entitled to relief where, by reason of residential segregation, substantial racial imbalance\nexists in his school. . . . The right to an equal opportunity for education and the harmful consequences of\nsegregation require that school boards take steps, insofar as reasonably feasible, to alleviate racial imbalance in\nschools, regardless of cause.\" (Emphasis added.) 382 P. 2d at 881. Exactly what the Supreme Court of California\nhad in mind as \"substantial\" imbalance has not been subsequently elucidated.\nMassachusetts has dealt with the problem of racial imbalance by statute in the Massachusetts Racial Imbalance\nAct of 1965, St. 1965, c.641. The Act specifically defines the term \"racial imbalance\" as referring to a \"ratio\nbetween non-white and other students in public schools which is sharply out of balance with the racial\ncomposition of the society in which non-white children study, serve and work. For the purpose of this section, \nracial imbalance shall be deemed to exist when the percent of non-white students in any public school is in\nexcess of fifty percent of the total number of students in such school.\" (Emphasis added.) In School Committee of\nBoston v. Board of Education, 352 Mass. 693, 227 N.E. 2d 729 (1967),appeal dismissed for want of a substantial\nfederal question,389 U.S. 572, 19 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1968), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld\n[23]\nthe Act against constitutional attack similar to that defeated in Tometz, supra.\n71 *71 The Supreme Court of New Jersey has long recognized that the State Board of Education is statutorily\nempowered to correct racial imbalance in the public schools of that state. Recognizing the difficulty in defining at\nwhat point existing imbalance endangers equality of educational opportunity, that court has tentatively adopted\nthe 50% test, relying on Barksdale, supra, but at the same time cautions that 00 \"the goal here is a reasonable\n97\nplan achieving the greatest dispersal consistent with sound educational values and procedures. This brings into\nplay numerous factors to be conscientiously weighed by the school authorities. Considerations of safety,\nconvenience, time, economy and other acknowledged virtues of the neighborhood school policy must be borne in\nmind.\" Booker v. Board of Education, 45 N.J. 161, 212 A. 2d 1, 11 (1965).\nIn New York, the Board of Regents promulgates the state policy on racial imbalance. As of 1964, the Board stated\n[24]\nthat balance \"was an important means to a good education, but not . . . an end in itself\"  In 1963, the State\n72 Education Department established a 50% Negro *72 school population as a cutoff point for initiating inquiry into\nthe possible existence of de facto segregation, but indicated that this percentage did not constitute a definition of\nracial imbalance. An effort by the New York legislature to strip the Board of Regents of its power to deal with de\nfacto segregation, N.Y. Educ. Law § 3201(2) (McKinney 1970), was held unconstitutional in Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F.\nSupp. 710 (W.D.N.Y. 1970),aff'd,402 U.S. 935, 29 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1971). The Board, however, had earlier\nabandoned its racial balance policy in large urban areas (New York City) where appreciable change was not\npossible through transportation, gerrymandering and construction of new schools.\n\nOther Authorities: An extensive research study conducted at the behest of the U.S. Department of Health,\nEducation and Welfare makes a strong case for the proposition that the quality of education offered in a school in\nwhich students come predominantly from families of lower economic status (which unfortunately is to a large\nextent synonymous with Negro families) is measurably inferior to that offered in schools where the majority of\nchildren were middle class. \"[Comparing the test results], in every case but one the highest average score is\nrecorded for the Negro pupils where more than half of their classmates were white.\" U.S. Dept. of H.E.W., Office\nof Education, Equality of Educational Opportunity 28 (J. Coleman ed. 1966) (the \"Coleman Report\") (emphasis\nadded). In the following year, the United States Commission on Civil Rights reexamined the data upon which the\nColeman Report was based and issued a report of its own, concluding with the following recommendation, inter\nalia, for legislative action:\n\"1. Congress should establish a uniform standard providing for the elimination of racial isolation in the schools.\n73 *73 \"Since large numbers of Negro children suffer harmful effects that are attributable in part to the racial\ncomposition of the schools they attend, legislation should provide for the elimination of schools in which such\nharm generally occurs. No standard of general applicability will fit every case precisely; some schools with a large\nproportion of Negro students may not in fact produce harmful effects while others with a smaller proportion may\nbe schools in which students are disadvantaged because of their race. But the alternative to establishing such a\nstandard is to require a time-consuming and ineffective effort to determine on a case-by-case basis the schools in\nwhich harm occurs. As it has in analagous situations, Congress should deal with this problem by establishing\nreasonable and practical standards which will correct the injustice without intruding unnecessarily into areas\nwhere no corrective action is needed.\n\"In prescribing such a reasonable standard, there is much to commend the criterion already adopted by the\nlegislature in Massachusetts and the Commissioner of Education in New York, defining as racially imbalanced,\nschools in which Negro pupils constitute more than 50 percent of the total enrollment. It was found in this report\nthat when Negro students in schools with more than 50 percent Negro enrollment were compared with similarly\nsituated Negro students in schools with a majority white enrollment, there were significant differences in attitude\nand performance. It is the schools that have a majority-Negro enrollment that tend to be regarded and treated by\nthe community as segregated and inferior schools. Although there are many factors involved, the racial\ncomposition of schools that are majority-Negro in enrollment tends to be less stable than that of majority-white\nschools and to be subject to more rapid change.\n74 *74 \"Similar arguments might be advanced for a standard which would deviate slightly from a 50 percent\ncriterion, but a standard set significantly higher would not be adequate to deal with the problem and probably\nwould not result in lasting solution.\" 1 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Racial Isolation in the Public Schools\n209-10 (1967). Judge J. Skelly Wright, whose opinion in Hobsen v. Hansen we have already quoted, advocated\nin a law review article that de facto segregation is unconstitutional and he set forth the following definition of the\ndegree of imbalance he would urge as unlawful: \"[A] school, though mathematically racially imbalanced as\ncompared with other schools in the area, ordinarily would not be racially segregated in the constitutional sense \nunless the Negro population of the school outnumbered the white.\" Wright, Public School Desegregation: Legal\nRemedies for De Facto Segregation, 16 Western Reserve L. Rev. 478, 495 (1965). Professor Fiss is of the view\nthat no case has been made for the proposition that maximum racial mixing, the remedy for de jure segregation,\nis a reasonable solution for de facto segregation. Fiss, The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Case 00 Its Significance for\n97\nNorthern School Desegregation, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 697, 706 (1971). See also Fiss, Racial Imbalance in the\nPublic Schools: The Constitutional Concepts, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 564, 571 (1965). Professor Kurland questions the\nmanageability of the concept of \"equal educational opportunity\", cautioning that the remedy of maximum racial\nmixing may be an example of sacrificing common sense to a syllogism. Kurland, Equal Educational Opportunity: \nThe Limits of Constitutional Jurisprudence, 35 U. Chi. L. Rev. 583, 589 (1968). A general counsel for the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) said the following with respect to defining de\n75 facto segregation in mathematical terms: \"The percentage issue becomes relevant only when corrective *75\nmeasures are considered. Some social scientists are of the opinion that each school in a school system should\nreflect the ethnic characteristics of the community. This is an optimum solution. The evil that must be remedied,\nhowever, is the consignment of Negroes to particular schools. Percentages may well be used as guidelines in this\n\nconnection, but rigid application of any arithmetic ethnic formula is not required.\" Carter, De Facto School\nSegregation: An Examination of the Legal and Constitutional Questions Presented, 16 Western Reserve L. Rev.\n502, 527 (1965) (emphasis added).\nIn summary of the foregoing review, it appears that the mathematical definition of de facto segregation which the\nCommission has adopted and which we are asked to say is not a statement of the Legislature's intention in\n[25]\nproscribing \"unlawful discriminatory practice[s]\" under the Human Relations Act  is without discoverable\nsupport in the legal and sociological materials which we have examined. As far as we have been able to\nascertain, the definition of racial imbalance adopted by the Commission reflects only the opinions of Dr. Wolff and\nof Dr. Dodson, upon whom the Commission has relied for consulting services. In view of the absence of any\nlanguage in section 5(i) (1) of the Human Relations Act supportive of the Commission's definition and in view of\nthe uniqueness of that definition, we are unable to say that such was the intention of our General Assembly when\nit enacted the public accommodations section of the Act in 1961, 43 P.S. § 954 (Supp. 1973-74).\nIII.\nAlthough we are of opinion that the Commission's definition of de facto segregation is not statutorily mandated,\n76 this is not to say that the Commission was *76 without power to adopt it. To the contrary, we are of the view that\nthe Legislature in section 7 of the Human Relations Act, as amended, 43 P.S. § 957, did empower the\nCommission to supply such a definition. In that section it is provided that 00\n97\n\"The Commission shall have the following powers and duties:\n. . .\n\"(d) To adopt, promulgate, amend and rescind rules and regulations to effectuate the policies and provisions of\nthis act.\n\"(e) To formulate policies to effectuate the purposes of this act, and make recommendations to agencies and\nofficers of the Commonwealth or political subdivisions of government or board, department, commission or\nschool district thereof to effectuate such policies.\n. . .\n\"(k) From time to time but not less than once a year, to report to the Legislature and the Governor describing in\ndetail the investigations, proceedings and hearings it has conducted and their outcome, the decisions it has\nrendered and the other work performed by it, and make recommendations for such further legislation concerning\nabuses and discrimination because of race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age or national origin as may be\ndesirable.\"\nThere is a well-recognized distinction in the law of administrative agencies between the authority of a rule\nadopted by an agency pursuant to what is denominated by the textwriters as legislative rule-making power and\nthe authority of a rule adopted pursuant to interpretative rule-making power. The former type of rule \"is the\nproduct of an exercise of legislative power by an administrative agency, pursuant to a grant of legislative power\n77 by the Legislative body\", and \"is valid and is as binding upon a court as a statute *77 if it is (a) within the granted\npower, (b) issued pursuant to proper procedure, and (c) reasonable\". K.C. Davis, 1 Administrative Law Treatise §\n5.03, at 299 (1958). A court, in reviewing such a regulation, \"is not at liberty to substitute its own discretion for\nthat of administrative officers who have kept within the bounds of their administrative powers To show that these\nhave been exceeded in the field of action . . . involved, it is not enough that the prescribed system of accounts\nshall appear to be unwise or burdensome or inferior to another. Error or unwisdom is not equivalent to abuse.\nWhat has been ordered must appear to be `so entirely at odds with fundamental principles . . . as to be the\nexpression of a whim rather than an exercise of judgment.'\" American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. United\nStates, 299 U.S. 232, 236-37, 81 L. Ed. 142 (1936). See also Seattle First National Bank v. United States, 44 F.\nSupp. 603, 607 (E.D. Wash. 1942); In re Da Lomba's Case, 352 Mass. 598, 603, 227 N.E. 2d 513 (1967) (\"rules\nwhich have been promulgated pursuant to a legislative grant of power generally have the force of law. . . .\"); \n\nBarry Laboratories v. Wisconsin Board of Pharmacy, 26 Wis. 2d 505, 132 N.W. 2d 833 (1965); Duke Molner\nWholesale Liquor Co. v. Martin, 180 Cal. App. 2d 873, 4 Cal. Rptr. 904,cert. denied,364 U.S. 870, 5 L. Ed. 2d 92\n(1960) (\"An administrative rule which is legislative in character is subject to the same test with reference to its\nvalidity as is an act of the Legislature.. . .\"); Report of the U.S. Attorney General's Commission on Administrative\nProcedure 99-100 (1941).\nAn interpretative rule on the other hand depends for its validity not upon a law-making grant of power, but rather\nupon the willingness of a reviewing court to say that it in fact tracks the meaning of the statute it interprets. While\n78 courts traditionally accord the interpretation of the agency charged with administration *78 of the act some\n[26]\ndeference,  the meaning of a statute is essentially a question of law for the court, and, when convinced that\nthe interpretative regulation adopted by an administrative agency is unwise or violative of legislative intent, courts\ndisregard the regulation. See, e.g., United States v. Cartwright, 411 U.S. 546, 93 S. Ct. 1713, 36 L. Ed. 2d 528\n(1973); Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944).\nWhether or not the Human Relations Commission's definition of de facto segregation is backed by legislative as\ndistinguished from merely interpretative power is in turn a question of \"whether or not it is issued pursuant to a\ngrant of law-making power\". Davis, supra, § 5.03, at 302. The statutory provisions quoted above evidence to us a\nlegislative intent to empower the Commission to do a good deal more than merely interpert the Act. The\nCommission can \"adopt, promulgate and rescind rules and regulations to effectuate the policies and provisions of\n[the] act\" and can \"formulate policies to effectuate the purposes of [the] act\". One of the declared purposes of the\nHuman Relations Act is \"to assure equal opportunities to all individuals and to safeguard their rights at places of\npublic accommodation.. . .\" 43 P.S. § 952(b) (Supp. 1973-74). The equal opportunity safeguarded in schools, of\n79 course, is *79 equal educational opportunity and the Commission's view that maximum possible racial mixing\nwithin a school district's buildings fosters equal educational opportunity cannot be said to be beyond the\nCommission's authority, arbitrary or unreasonable.\nWe note additionally that the Commission's view requiring maximum racial mixing corresponds to the remedy a\nfederal court would order, after Brown v. Board of Education (I), 347 U.S. 483, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), following a\nfinding of de jure segregation. See Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 438, 20 L. Ed. 2d 716 (1968)\n(requiring elimination of segregation \"root and branch\"). Paraphrasing only slightly what we said in Balsbaugh v.\nRowland, 00 \"If [maximum racial mixing] may be [the] acceptable, and indeed required, [remedy] in attempting to\n97\novercome racial segregation where that condition is historically of de jure origin, it would indeed be anomalous if\n[it] were nevertheless considered to be unreasonable, discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional . . . when\nvoluntarily employed by a state to rectify an imbalance which is the product of de facto segregation.\" 447 Pa. at\n438. The Commission's definition of the concept of de facto segregation is therefore upheld as within the\n80 legislative powers conferred by section 7 of the Act.[27] The wisdom *80 or unwisdom of the Commission's\ndefinition is no business of ours, the Legislature having by section 7(k), supra, placed upon the Commission the\nduty to make an annual report of its activities and thus having enabled itself to pass upon the policies of the\n[28]\nCommission. This the Commission has done.\n[29]\nThe orders of the Commonwealth Court are affirmed.\n81 Mr. Justice MANDERINO concurs in the result. *81\n82 *82\n                                                       APPENDIX\n                      New Castle Sch.

The definition of \"place of public accommodation\" specifically includes\n\"kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, [and] high schools.\" Id. at 43 P.S. § 954(l) (Supp. 1973). The\nLegislature has declared that it is unlawful to \"[r]efuse, withhold from, or deny to any person because of his race,\ncolor, religious creed, ancestry or national origin, . . . either directly or indirectly, any of the accommodations,\nadvantages, facilities or privileges of [a] place of public accommodation. . . .\" Id. at 43 P.S. § 955(i) (l) (Supp.\n1973). To effectuate the purposes of this Act, the Legislature created the Pennsylvania Human Relations\nCommission and vested in it the power to \"adopt, promulgate, amend and rescind rules and regulations to\n\neffectuate the policies and provisions of [the] act,\" Id. at 43 P.S. § 957(d) (1964), and to \"formulate policies to\neffectuate the purpose of [the] act. . . .\" Id. at 43 P.S. § 957(e) (1964).\nThe wisdom of the actions of the Commission is not subject to this Court's review. Our single jurisprudential task\nis to determine whether the Commission's actions are within the authority delegated to it by the Legislature. \nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A. 2d 290 (1967); cf. \nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Alto-Reste Park Cemetery Association, 453 Pa. 124, 306 A. 2d\n881 (1973). A court reviewing the actions of an administrative agency \"is not at liberty to substitute its own\n84 discretion for that of administrative *84 officers who have kept within the bounds of their administrative powers.\nTo show that these have been exceeded in the field of action . . . involved, it is not enough that the prescribed\nsystem . . . shall appear to be unwise or burdensome or inferior to another. Error or unwisdom is not equivalent to\nabuse. What has been ordered must appear to be `so entirely at odds with fundamental principles . . .' as to be\nthe expression of a whim rather than an exercise of judgment.\" American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. United\nStates, 299 U.S. 232, 236-37, 57 S. Ct. 170, 172 (1936).\nThe majority, applying this test, has, in my view, correctly concluded that \"the Commission's view that maximum\npossible racial mixing within a school district's buildings fosters equal educational opportunity cannot be said to\nbe beyond the Commission's authority, arbitrary or unreasonable.\" Having so concluded, the inquiry must end.\nThe Commonwealth Court correctly affirmed the orders of the Human Relations Commission. See Alto-Reste\nPark Cemetery Association, supra; Chester School District, supra. Accordingly, I concur in the result.\nMr. Chief Justice JONES and Mr. Justice NIX join in this concurring opinion.\n[1] \"It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice . . . (i) For any person being the owner, lessee, proprietor,\nmanager, superintendent, agent or employe of a place of public accommodation, resort or amusement to (1)\nRefuse, withhold from, or deny to any person because of his race, color, religious creed, ancestry or national\norigin, or to any person due to use of a guide dog because of the blindness of the user, either directly or\nindirectly, any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges of such place of public accommodation,\nresort or amusement.\" A public school is defined under section 4 of the Act, as amended, 43 P.S. § 954 (Supp.\n1973-74), as a \"place of public accommodation.\"\n[2] We quoted, with neither approval nor disapproval, the definition offered by one scholar: \"[D]e facto\nsegregation may be defined simply as the racial imbalance in schools which occurs when the number of Negroes\nin a compact Negro area becomes so great that drawing school zone boundaries on a geographical basis causes\nthe great majority of Negro children to attend schools which are overwhelmingly Negro in population.\" Kaplan,\nSegregation Litigation and the Schools 00 Part I: The New Rochelle Experience; 58 Nw. U.L. Rev. 1, 2 (1963).\n97\n[3] The Chester School District at that time operated three all Negro schools, two schools that were within one\npercent of all Negro, and one school that was 87% Negro, notwithstanding that the Negro students constituted\nonly some 65% of all school students in the district.\n[4] This is not to say that there has been a total absence of activity in the Legislature with regard to de facto\nsegregation. H.B. 1717, 156th Regular Session (1972), would have deleted from section 5(i)(1) of the Human\nRelations Act the words \"kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, high schools, academies, colleges and\nuniversities, extension courses and all educational institutions under the supervision of this Commonwealth\", thus\nleaving the Commission powerless to remedy \"unlawful discriminatory practice[s]\" occurring at such institutions.\nThis bill, in amended form, passed the House on June 13, 1972. See 1 Pa. Legis. Journal, No. 144, at 3040-41\n(June 13, 1972) (104 yeas; 88 nays; 10 not voting). The Bill was not acted upon by the Senate. It was\nreintroduced, however, on January 22, 1973 in the 157th Regular Session as H.B. 96 and is now in committee.\n[5] During the Commission hearing in the Uniontown Area School District case, the Commission's Director of the\nEducation Division, Mr. Richard B. Anliot, testified as follows with respect to the manner in which the Commission\ncame to adopt the above documents: \"The Commonwealth's definition of what is a segregated or racially\nbalanced school is contained in the two documents to which I referred earlier that were adopted by the State\nDepartment of Education and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission in March and May of 1968,\n\nrespectively. The one adopted in March, 1968, was the `Desegregation Guidelines for Public Schools', in which it\nspeaks of segregation as `An untoward concentration of any racial group in one building', and in the document\nadopted in May, 1968, titled, `Recommended Elements of a School Desegregation Plan', in which a specific\nevaluation question, `How nearly does the desegregation plan bring the per cent Negro pupils in each building to\nwithin 30 per cent of the per cent Negro pupils among the buildings of the same grade span?' These are the two\nparts of the Commonwealth's definition of a segregated or racially balanced school. \n\"[We considered other definitions of segregation] at great length. Before the Commission and Department\nadopted this definition, the Commission first contracted with New York University Center of Human Relations and\nCommunity Studies and Services, Dan W. Dodson, specifically; secondly, it pulled together the definitions of what\nconstitutes racially imbalanced schools that have come forth from other states and from other state courts and\ndepartments of education and a great length and very intensively considered those alternate definitions. It, for\nexample, considered the definition in the Massachusetts Racial Imbalance Act of 1965, and the comparable\nposition of the Commissioner of Education of New York State which deemed that a school is racially imbalanced\nif it has a 50 per cent or more Negro pupils. This was concluded by the Commission and Department to be too\nnarrow, too rigid and without the reality of a proportion of black pupils in a particular public school district or\nparticular grade span.\n\"It also considered the definition of the Supreme Courts of California and New Jersey which simply said that a\nracially imbalanced school was one with substantial imbalance, and, once again, this was rejected by the\nDepartment and Commission as too imprecise. So that the final definition was felt to be one that could be\nrealistically 00 that a state of racial balance and desegregation of a school could be realistically achieved and,\n97\nmost importantly, would be based on the reality of each school district separately.\" Uniontown Record at 22a-24a.\n[6] The Commission's Director of the Education Division testified that the Commission has yet made no decision\nwhether to proceed against school districts which are imbalanced under the Commission's formula but which\nhave no single school with more than 50% Negro students. New Kensington-Arnold Record at 128a.\n[7] Because the practical operation of the Commission's definition may not be self-evident, we set forth a sample\ncalculation: \nExample One: Assume a school district in which 10% of the elementary school students are Negroes. Each\nelementary school of this district must have a percentage of Negro students in the range of 7 00 13% (10% x 30%\n97\n(permissible deviation) = 3%).\nExample Two: As above, but with a Negro percentage of 50%. A school within the range 35% 00 65% Negro is\n97\n\"racially balanced\" (50% x 30% (permissible deviation) = 15%).\n[8] See note 1 supra. The Commission proved a violation of the Human Relations Act in all three hearings\ninvolved here as follows: counsel for the Commission called as a witness Mr. Richard B. Anliot, the Commission's\nDirector of the Education Division. Mr. Anliot, in his examination, introduced himself, testified to the existence of\nthe \"Desegregation Guidelines for Public Schools\" and the \"Recommended Elements of a School Desegregation\nPlan\", and finally reviewed the statistics of racial distribution in appellants' schools, statistics which had been\nfurnished by the school districts themselves, pointing out in what particular the statistics varied from the\ndistribution permitted under the Commission's definition. The Commission then rested. Admittedly, no\ninvestigation was conducted into the operation of any district beyond ascertainment of the above statistical data.\n[9] The school districts argue here that the Commonwealth Court erred in consolidating the five appeals and point\nto our language in Chester, supra, to the effect that the Commission would proceed on \"a case-by-case basis\". \n427 Pa. at 179. We did not mean by that comment to shape a rule of appellate procedure. As will appear from\nsubsequent discussion, we think this point meritless.\n[10] Judge MENCER filed a dissenting opinion in which he distinguished Chester and Balsbaugh and argued that\nthe Commission's definition of racial imbalance is unsound and not that required under the Human Relations Act.\n[11] The school districts of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia did not join in the petition for allocatur and, hence, are not\nappellants here. \n\nWe additionally note that in its \"develop and submit\" orders entered against the appellant-school districts, the\nCommission, applying its definition of racial imbalance, found the districts to have racially segregated faculties as\nwell, and ordered affirmative steps to increase minority representation on appellants' faculties. The\nCommonwealth Court, however, unanimously refused to approve the orders as applicable to faculties and in its\nanswer to the petition for allowance of appeal, the Commission informed us that it had \"voted to comply with the\nCommonwealth Court's decision rather than appeal it and has amended its original order accordingly\".\n[12] In Balsbaugh we observed that the plan adopted by the Harrisburg City School District was designed to have\n\"the student enrollment in each school . . . reflect within ten percent (10%) the racial composition of the total\npublic school population\". 447 Pa. at 427 (emphasis added). Whether or not the 10% deviation referred to was\nproduced by application of the Commission's formula we cannot tell, as the matter was decided on a demurrer\nand the pleadings do not contain information as to the derivation of the racial balance adopted by the Harrisburg\nCity School District.\n[13] Appellee's Brief in New Castle Area School District at 42.\n[14] Some earlier lower court decisions were to the contrary. See, e.g., Cisnerso v. Corpus Christi Independent\nSchool District, 467 F. 2d 142 (5th Cir. 1972),cert. denied,413 U.S. 920, 93 S. Ct. 3053 (1973); Barksdale v.\nSpringfield School Committee, 237 F. Supp. 543 (D. Mass. 1965),vacated,348 F. 2d 261 (1st Cir. 1965).\n[15] 42 U.S.C. § 2000c(b) (1970) defines \"desegregation\" as 00 \"the assignment of students to public schools and\n97\nwithin such schools without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin, but `desegregation' shall not\nmean the assignment of students to public schools in order to overcome racial imbalance.\" (Emphasis added.) \n42 U.S.C. § 2000c-6(a) (1970) authorizes the Attorney General to institute legal actions on behalf of persons who\nclaim to be the victims of racial segregation in public schools, but with the following limitation: \"[N]othing herein\nshall empower any official or court of the United States to issue any order seeking to achieve a racial balance in\nany school by requiring the transportation of pupils or students from one school to another or one school district\nto another in order to achieve such racial balance, or otherwise enlarge the existing power of the court to insure\ncompliance with constitutional standards.\" See also 45 C.F.R. § 180.2(b) (1972).\n[16] We note, however, that in the Education Amendments Act of 1972, Congress has prohibited the use of\nfederal funds \"for the transportation of students or teachers . . . in order to overcome racial imbalance in any\nschool or school system, or . . . in order to carry out a plan of racial desegregation of any school or school\nsystem, except on the express written voluntary request of appropriate local school officials\". Pub. L. No. 92-318,\n92d Cong, tit. VIII, 802(a), 20 U.S.C.A. § 1652(a) (Supp. 1973). \nIt is possible, therefore, that federal funds may be unavailable to defray the cost of whatever transportation of\npupils may be incurred in complying with the orders of the Commission. The exact impact on school financing\ncannot be determined until such time as desegregation plans acceptable to the Commission are adopted. We\nnote, however, that New Kensington-Arnold possesses no school buses at all and lacks cafeteria equipment to\nprovide lunches for children unable to walk home at noon.\nFor a discussion of the Education Act Amendments, see Comment, Interpreting the Anti-Busing Provisions of the\nEducation Amendments Act of 1972, 10 Harv. J. Legis. 256 (1972); A.J. Goldberg, The Administration's Anti-\nBusing Proposals 00 Politics Makes Bad Law, 67 Nw. U.L. Rev. 319 (1972).\n97\n[17] See generally Anno., De Facto Segregation of Races in Public Schools, 11 A.L.R. 3d 780 (1967).\n[18] See also in this connection the separate opinion of Mr. Justice POWELL in Keyes v. School District No. 1,\nDenver, Colorado, supra, 41 U.S.L.W. at 5009: \n\"An integrated school system does not mean 00 and indeed could not mean in view of the residential patterns of\n97\nmost of our major metropolitan areas 00 that every school must in fact be an integrated unit. A school which\n97\nhappens to be all or predominantly white or all or predominantly black is not a `segregated' school in an\nunconstitutional sense if the system itself is a genuinely integrated one.\"\n\n* * *\n\"[T]he question then becomes what reasonable affirmative desegregative steps district courts may require to\nplace the school system in compliance with the constitutional standard. In short, what specifically is the nature\nand scope of the remedy?\"\n* * *\n\"[I]n school desegregation cases, as elsewhere, equity counsels reason, flexibility and balance. * * * I am aware,\nof course, that reasonableness in any area is a relative and subjective concept. But with school desegregation,\nreasonableness would seem to embody a balanced evaluation of the obligation of public school boards to\npromote desegregation with other, equally important educational interests which a community may legitimately\nassert. Neglect of either the obligation or the interests destroys the evenhanded spirit with which equitable\nremedies must be approached.\"\n[19] Dr. Wolff devised a plan for the desegregation of the Chester School District which was favorably received by\nthe Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. See Chester, supra, at 173 n.15 Dr. Wolff and Dr. Dodson, see\nnote 5 supra, upon whom the Commission has relied as an education consultant, are the only sociologists to our\nknowledge who have urged the adoption of a mathematical formula to achieve maximum racial balance; both\nadopted the standard themselves as early as 1963. \nIn Bell application of Dr. Wolff's formula to the Gary school system (54% Negro) produced the following definition\nof an integrated school: a building with a Negro pupil percentage between 36% and 72%. As we will later\nindicate, more recent sociological studies show that it is the predominantly Negro school (or more precisely the\npredominantly lower economic class school) which is to be avoided if possible. Thus, in a school district that is\napproximately 50% Negro, permissible deviation would be minimal. It is a peculiar feature of the Commission's\nformula that at the higher percentages of Negro students (50% for example), the formula permits a deviation of\nplus or minus 15%, while at the lower percentages (10% as is the case in these appeals), the formula permits\nonly plus or minus 3%. One might argue that the sensitivity to deviation were better reversed.\n[20] Dr. Pettigrew is not without detractors. See Brunson v. Board of Trustees of School District No. 1 of\nClarendon County, South Carolina, 429 F. 2d 820, 824 (4th Cir. 1970) (SOBELOFF, J., concurring, joined by\nWINTER, J.). He has his supporters as well. See Brief of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in School\nBoard of Richmond v. State Board of Education, U.S. Sup. Ct. No. 72-549, at 10: \"[That] an integrated setting can\nbe as potentially damaging psychologically as a segregated setting is amply supported by a growing body of\nscientific data.\" The statistical data in the Appendix, infra, reveal that in a class of 20 students, two students will\nbe black after implementation of the formula adopted by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. In a\nclass of 30, three will be black. The appellant-school districts argue with some force that such a minority\nrepresentation violates that part of the Commission's final order which directs that \"[s]aid plan shall avoid extreme\nisolation of black pupils in a classroom\".\n[21] Comment, State Remedies for Racial Imbalance: Increasing Their Educational Impact, 3 Col. Survey of\nHuman Rights Law 1, 3 (1971).\n[22] Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, § 10-21.3 (1967): \"As soon as practicable, and from time to time thereafter, the [local\nschool] board shall change or revise existing [attendance] units or create new units in a manner which will take\ninto consideration the prevention of segregation and the elimination of separation of school children in public\nschools because of color, race or nationality.\"\n[23] The Massachusetts Act is reviewed critically at Note, Massachusetts Racial Imbalance Act, 5 Harv. J. Legis.\n83 (1967). The author explains the adoption of the 50 percent definition as follows: \n\"Today, there is much debate over `tipping points' both in schools and neighborhood housing. The evidence is\ninadequate and hence precludes a precise sociological-psychological definition of `balance'. But a statute must\nhave some definition in order to operate efficiently and effectively. The inconclusiveness of sociological evidence\nshould not deter states from beginning to correct racial imbalance. In the present Act, a figure of fifty percent\n\nnonwhite, although an arbitrary number, is such a beginning. As a suitable starting point, fifty percent has support\nin New York, the federal courts, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\n* * *\n\"The focus should be on the point at which the percentage of non-white students in a school deprives them of an\nequal educational opportunity and not on whether each school has a minimum percentage of non-white students\nin its population.\" Id. at 93, 95.\n[24] Summary of the State Education Department's Position with Respect to the Elimination of De Facto\nSegregation (Albany, Mar. 6, 1964), quoted in State Remedies for Racial Imbalance, supra note 21, at 18.\n[25] See note 1, supra.\n[26] Professor Davis summarizes the factors which affect judicial review of interpretative regulations as follows:\n\"An interpretative rule may or may not have the force of law, depending upon such factors as (a) whether the\ncourt agrees or disagrees with the rule, (b) the extent to which the subject matter is within special administrative\ncompetence and beyond general judicial competence, (c) whether the rule is a contemporaneous construction of\nthe statute by those who are assigned the task of construction of the statute, (d) whether the rule is one of long\nstanding, and (e) whether the statute has been reenacted by legislators who know the content of the rule.\" K.C.\nDavis, 1 Administrative Law Treatise § 5.03, at 300 (1958).\n[27] We do not intend by our holding that the Commission has power legislative in nature to resurrect the\nargument, disposed of in Chester, supra, that the Legislature has attempted to delegate its power\nunconstitutionally. The existence of such power in an administrative agency has not generally been thought to\nviolate that constitutional limitation, at least where the statute provides an ascertainable standard to guide\nadministrative exercise of that power. Chartiers Valley Joint Schools v. Allegheny County Board of School\nDirectors, 418 Pa. 520, 211 A. 2d 487 (1965); K.C. Davis, 1 Administrative Law Treatise §§ 2.02, 2.03 (1958). \nAs we held in Chester, we think the standard of the Act (safeguarding equal educational opportunity from harmful\neffects of racial segregation) coupled with the procedural safeguards of the Administrative Agency Law and the\nCommonwealth Documents Law permit approval of the possession by the Commission of power by nature\nlegislative.\n[28] Our review of the Annual Reports submitted under this section reveals that the duty of keeping the\nLegislature informed of its policy with regard to de facto school segregation has been well discharged. \nIn 1968, for example, the year in which the Commission settled on its definition, it informed the Legislature:\n\"[G]uidelines for desegregating public schools were approved and issued jointly by the Commission and [the\nDepartment of Public Instruction], and were sent March 29 to [seventeen school districts with any one school\ncontaining more than 80% Negro pupils]. . . .\n\"The guidelines stated that, insofar as possible, every school building should reflect in its enrollment a cross\nsection of the entire community.\" (Emphasis added.)\nPa. Human Relations Commission, Thirteenth Annual Report 5 (1968). The Commission's view of what\nconstituted de facto segregation was brought to the attention of the Legislature in the two succeeding years as\nwell. See Fourteenth Annual Report at 16 (1969), and the January-June Report of 1970.\n[29] Although the appellant-districts have not raised the issue, we observe that there is some question whether it\ncan be said that the second precondition to the validity of a Legislative rule 00 \"issued pursuant to proper\n97\nprocedure\", see Davis, supra, at 299 00 is fairly met here. The Commission's definition of a segregated school,\n97\nnotwithstanding its having been labeled a \"finding of fact\" in the final orders issued by the Commission, is clearly\na substantive rule of law; we have so regarded it in this opinion. \nPrior to the effective date of the new Commonwealth Documents Law, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 769, No. 240, 45\nP.S. § 1101 et seq. (Supp. 1973-74), the rules and regulations of the Commission were required by section 21 of\n\nthe Administrative Agency Law, Act of June 4, 1945, as amended, 71 P.S. § 1710.21, to be placed on file with the\nDepartment of State for the examination of interested citizens. The Commission's definition of de facto\nsegregation does not appear to have been published as a rule or regulation; certainly it was not among those\nexisting rules and regulations brought over into the Pennsylvania Code under the Commonwealth Documents\nLaw. Under that new Law, an agency preparing to adopt a rule must give public notice of its intention, 45 P.S. §\n1201, must \"review and consider any written comments submitted\", 45 P.S. § 1202, and \"may hold such public\nhearings as seem appropriate\". Although 45 P.S. § 1204 does exempt certain types of regulations from this\nprocess, legislative (as contrasted with interpretative) rules are not excepted.\nIn NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S. 759, 22 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1969), six Justices of the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States indicated that the parallel provisions of the federal Administrative Procedure Act were mandatory\nand that federal agencies could not bypass the legislatively specified procedures for policy formulation\n(procedures designed to bring a broad spectrum of opinion to bear) in favor of a procedure of developing policy\nby adjudicatory proceedings.\nIn exercising a power legislative in nature, we think it necessary to comply fully with legislatively-prescribed\nprocedures. See L.L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 566 (1965). Whether or not the\nCommission's definition, formulated in an administrative procedure of unspecified nature, adopted without the\nbroad public notice required under the Documents Law, and unpublished as a rule or regulation so complies are\nquestions which we do not now pass upon and which must await proper presentation.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
