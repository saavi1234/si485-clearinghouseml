The lawsuit challenged the refusal of the Board of Education to release identifying information for the parents and guardians of students attending the Hartford Transitional Learning Academy (HTLA), a school for seriously emotionally disturbed children.  OPA sought this information so it could obtain releases from the parents and guardians in order to conduct an investigation of allegations of abuse and neglect against students.  The complaint alleged violations of the Protections and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act (PAIR).  </p><p>On February 7, 2005, the district court (Judge Janet C. Hall) granted plaintiff's Motion for a Permanent Injunction and ordered defendants to grant OPA with physical access to the students at HTLA and with names and contact information necessary to conduct an investigation.  Conn. Office of Prot. & Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 355 F. Supp. 2d 649 (D. Conn. 2005).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Judge Sonia Sotomayor) affirmed the decision on September 15, 2006.  Conn. Office of Prot. & Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v.

NO. 3] \nSeeking declaratory and injunctive relief, the plaintiffs, the State of Connecticut\nOffice of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities (\"OPA\") and its\nExecutive Director, James McCaughey, initiated this action against the defendants,\nHartford Board of Education, Hartford Public Schools, and Robert Henry, on August 11,\n2004.  On that same date, they filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction requesting\naccess to the Hartford Transitional Learning Academy (\"HTLA\") and directory\ninformation for students and their parents or guardians for the purposes of conducting\nan investigation into allegations of abuse and neglect at HTLA. [Dkt. No. 3].  The\nplaintiffs claim that, pursuant to certain federal statutes, they are entitled to access\nfacilities treating persons with certain disabilities and mental illnesses for the purposes\n1\n\nof investigating allegations of mistreatment or abuse.  28 U.S.C. §794e; 42 U.S.C.\n§15001 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-10827.  On August 31, 2004, the parties agreed to\nmerge the request for a preliminary injunction with the plaintiffs’ request for a\npermanent injunction.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 65(a)(2).  The parties also agreed to stipulate\nto certain facts for the purposes of the Motion for a Permanent Injunction.  Stipulations\nof Fact [Dkt. No. 13].  The court heard oral argument on January 21, 2005.  On that\ndate, the defendants withdrew its then-pending Motion to Strike [Dkt. No. 16].\nI. FACTS\nThe parties have stipulated certain facts.  The Hartford Transitional Learning\nAcademy is operated by the Hartford Board of Education for the purpose of providing a\ntherapeutic educational program for students who require special education and related\nservices and who are considered \"seriously emotionally disturbed.\"  Stipulations of Fact\n[Dkt. No. 13] at ¶¶ 6-7.  The plaintiffs allege that they have received complaints that\nstudents at HTLA have been subjected to inappropriate restraint and seclusion and that\nin certain instances, students have suffered injury as a result.  Id. at ¶ 12.  The\ndefendants concede that Hartford Public Schools policy allows teachers and\nadministrators at HTLA to \"use reasonable physical force when he/she believes it is\nnecessary to (a) protect himself/herself or others from immediate physical injury; (b)\nobtain possession of a dangerous instrument or controlled substance upon or within the\ncontrol of such student; or (c) protect property from physical damages.\"  Usage of\nTherapeutic Physical Restraint to Maintain Safety [Dkt. No. 13, Ex. B].  As a result of\ncomplaints and other evidence, OPA has determined that probable cause exists to\nsuspect that HTLA students are subjected to abuse and neglect.  Stipulations of Fact\n2\n\n[Dkt. No. 13] at ¶ 14.\nUpon making this determination, OPA and the Office of the Child Advocate\ninitiated an investigation of HTLA.  Id. at ¶ 15.  On February 3, 2004, McGaughey and\nJoanne Milstein of the Office of the Child Advocate wrote to Defendant Henry to notify\nhim that they would be investigating complaints received \"regarding the provision of\neducational and related services to Hartford students\" at HTLA.  Letter, February 3,\n2004 [Dkt. No. 13, Ex. D].  On February 10, representatives of OPA and the Office of\nthe Child Advocate went to HTLA.  Stipulations of Fact [Dkt. No. 13] at ¶ 17.  They were\ndenied access to students and to records.  Id.  Representatives of OPA and the\nHartford Board of Education and Hartford Public Schools attempted to negotiate a\nresolution.  Disputes regarding the applicability of OPA’s authorizing statutes to HTLA,\nas well as HTLA’s ability to provide the information requested by OPA in the face of\nfederal law protecting students’ privacy and confidentiality, prevented such resolution. \nSee Stipulations of Fact [Dkt. No. 13], ¶¶ 18-22.      \nII. ANALYSIS\nA. The Standards for a Permanent Injunction and Declaratory Relief\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory relief pursuant to section 2201 of Title 28 of the\nUnited States Code.  That section provides that \"any court of the United States, upon\nthe filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of\nany interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be\nsought.\"  28 U.S.C. §2201.   \"[A] court must entertain a declaratory judgment action: (1)\nwhen the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal\n3\n\nrelations in issue, or (2) when it will terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty,\ninsecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\"  Continental Cas. Co. v.\nCoastal Sav. Bank, 977 F.2d 734 (2d Cir. 1992) (citing Broadview Chem. Corp. v.\nLoctite Corp., 417 F.2d 998, 1001 (2d Cir.1969)).\nThe plaintiffs also seek a permanent injunction.  \"Generally, to obtain a\npermanent injunction a party must show the absence of an adequate remedy at law and\nirreparable harm if the relief is not granted.\" New York State Nat. Organization for\nWomen v. Terry, 886 F.2d 1339, 1362 (2d Cir. 1989).  In addition, the plaintiff must\ndemonstrate actual success on the merits rather than a likelihood of success, as is\nrequired when a preliminary injunction is requested.  Amoco Production Co. v. Village of\nGambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 12 (1987).\nCourts have concluded that a protection and advocacy system’s inability to meet\nits federal statutory mandate to protect and advocate the rights of disabled people, see\ndiscussion, infra, section II.B., constitutes irreparable harm.  See Office of Protection\nand Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v, Armstrong, 266 F.Supp.2d 303, 310\n(D.Conn. 2003) (citing cases).  Should OPA demonstrate success on the merits, it is\nclear that there is no adequate remedy at law.  Id.  The only adequate relief would be to\nrequire the defendants to allow OPA access to HTLA and relevant records pursuant to\nthe relevant statutes.   \nB. OPA’s Authority Under Federal Statute\nThe OPA is established pursuant to Connecticut statute \"for the protection and\nadvocacy of the rights of persons with disabilities and developmentally disabled\npersons.\"  Conn. Gen. Stat. §46a-10.  It serves as the protection and advocacy system\n4\n\nfor the purposes of three federal statutes described below, the Developmental\nDisabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, the Protection and Advocacy of Individual\nRights Act, and the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act.  The OPA\nis bound by state and federal law regarding confidentiality.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §46a-11h;\n42 U.S.C. §10806.\n1.  The Development Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act\nThe Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (\"DD Act\")\nprovides for federal funding of state systems \"to protect the legal and human rights of\nindividuals with developmental disabilities. . . . .\"  42 U.S.C. §15041; 42 U.S.C. §15042. \nIn order to qualify for such funds, a state must have in place a system that is authorized\nto provide effective advocacy for and protection of the rights of developmentally\ndisabled persons.  42 U.S.C. §15043(a)(2)(A).  Further, such systems must \"have\naccess at reasonable times to any individual with a developmental disability in a\nlocation in which services, supports, and other assistance are provided to such an\nindividual\" as well as access to records of developmentally disabled individuals when\ncertain factors arise.  42 U.S.C. §15043(a)(2)(H) - (I).  Where a system is entitled to\naccess to records, such records must be provided to the system \"not later than 3\nbusiness days after the system makes a written request for the records involved.\"  42\nU.S.C. §15043(J)(I).  To the extent that developmentally disabled students attend\nHTLA, see discussion, infra, section II.C., the school is undoubtedly a \"location in which\nservices, supports, and other assistance are provided.\"  42 U.S.C. §15043(a)(2)(H) - (I).\n5\n\n2. The Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act\nThe Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act (\"PAIR\") creates an\nidentical framework with respect to the rights of individuals with disabilities.  29 U.S.C.\n§794e.  PAIR applies to individuals with disabilities who are not entitled to protection or\nservices under either the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act or the\nDD Act.  29 U.S.C. §794e(a)(1)(B).  In order to receive federal funds under PAIR, a\nstate must \"have in effect a system to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with\ndisabilities\" and such system must \"have the same general authorities, including access\nto records and program income, as are set forth\" in the DD Act.  42 U.S.C. §794e(f)(1)-\n(2).  Thus, while PAIR applies to a broader segment of the population of individuals with\ndisabilities, it allows protection and advocacy systems the same breadth of investigative\nand advocacy authority allowed under the DD Act.  Again, to the extent that students\nprotected by PAIR attend HTLA, see discussion, infra, section II.C, the school must\nprovide OPA with access to such students.   \n3. The Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act\nThe Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act (\"PAMII\")1 provides\nan similar system for the purposes of protecting the rights of mentally ill individuals.  42\nU.S.C. §10801-10807.  The Act provides for federal funding: \nto assist States to establish and operate a protection and advocacy\n1The parties sometimes refer to the Act as PAIMI.  While 1988 amendments removed\nfrom the Act all use of the term \"mentally ill individuals\" and, instead, substituted \"individuals\nwith mental illness,\" the name of the Act itself was not changed.  See Requirements Applicable\nto Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness; Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg.\n53548-01 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Therefore, the Act will be referred to as \"PAMII\" in this Ruling. \n \n6\n\nsystem for individuals with mental illness which will (A) protect and\nadvocate the rights of such individuals through activities to ensure\nenforcement of the Constitution and Federal and State statutes; and (B)\ninvestigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with mental\nillness if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable\ncause to believe that the incidents occurred.\n42 U.S.C. §10801(b)(2)(B).  In order to be eligible for such funding, states must\nestablish systems to \"(1) protect and advocate the rights of individuals with mental\nillness; and (2) investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with mental\nillness if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable cause to believe\nthat the incidents occurred.\"  42 U.S.C. §10803(2).  Such systems are authorized to\n\"investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness\" and\n\"pursue administrative, legal, and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection\nof individuals with mental illness who are receiving care or treatment in the state.\"  42\nU.S.C. §10805(a)(1)(A)-(B).  They are entitled to access to records where certain\ncriteria are met.  42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(4).  Such systems also must \"have access to\nfacilities in the State providing care or treatment.\"  42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(3).\nC. The DD Act, PAMII Act, and PAIR Act Authorize OPA to Investigate\nPossible Abuse and Neglect at HTLA\nCourts have found that protection and advocacy systems need not \"make a\nthreshold showing of mental illness\" in order to exercise their authority under PAMII. \nOffice of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Armstrong, 266\nF.Supp.2d 303, 313 (D.Conn. 2003); Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service v.\nMiller, 849 F.Supp. 1202, 1207 (W.D.Mich. 1994).  A denial of access on the grounds\nthat OPA has not made a conclusive showing that HTLA students are individuals with\nmental illness or developmentally disabled \"prevents [OPA] from bringing in their own\n7\n\nmental health professionals to ascertain whether any [students] do in fact suffer from\nmental illness.  Such conduct . . . defeats the very purpose of PAMII and the DD Act to\nprovide effective protection and advocacy services to mentally ill and developmentally\ndisabled persons.\"  Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service, 849 F.Supp. at 1207.\nInstead of requiring conclusive evidence that a particular person or persons\nqualifies as an individual with mental illness or developmentally disabled for the\npurposes of a protection and advocacy system’s authorizing statutes, courts have held\nthat a showing of \"substantial evidence\" must suffice in order for such systems to fulfill\ntheir statutory mandate.  See id. at 1207.  \"‘[E]vidence that a facility has previously\nhoused individuals who are mentally ill, as well as evidence that some current residents\nmay be mentally ill[,] is sufficient under PAMII to merit access by [protection and\nadvocacy systems].’\"  Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities,\n266 F.Supp.2d at 314 (quoting Kentucky Prot. & Advocacy Div. v. Hall, et al., No.\n3:01cv-538-H, slip. op. (W.D.Ky. Sept. 24, 2001)) (emphasis added).\nIn order to be placed at HTLA, a child must first be designated \"seriously\nemotionally disturbed.\"  Stipulations of Fact [Dkt. No. 13] at ¶ 7.  Defendants concede\nthat \"most HTLA students probably qualify as individuals with mental illness for PAMII’s\npurposes.\"  Def.’s Objection to Mot. for Permanent Injunction [Dkt. No. 12] at n. 11. \nIndeed, PAMII’s definition of an \"individual with mental illness\" includes an \"individual\nwho has a significant . . . emotional impairment.\"  42 U.S.C. §10802(4)(A).  That\ndefinition appears to be inclusive of individuals who are \"seriously emotionally\ndisturbed.\"  Federal regulations define the term \"serious emotional disturbance\" to\ninclude the following: \n8\n\n(1) A condition that has been confirmed by clinical evaluation and\ndiagnosis and that, over a long period of time and to a marked degree,\nadversely affects educational performance and that exhibits one or more\nof the following characteristics: (i) An inability to learn that cannot be\nexplained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.

(iv) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears\nassociated with personal or school problems. (v) A general, pervasive\nmood of unhappiness or depression.

The defendants provide the\nAffidavit of Jody S. Lefkowitz, Senior Director for Exceptional Children for Hartford\nPublic Schools, which Affidavit claims that students with severe developmental\ndisabilities are not placed at HTLA but are placed at other facilities in and outside of the\nHartford Public School system.  Affidavit of Jody S. Lefkowitz [Dkt. No. 12] at ¶¶ 8-10. \nIn response, OPA provides an affidavit from its Assistant Program Director attesting that\nof OPA’s former and current clients who are or have been students at HTLA, many\nhave been developmentally disabled and that students who present symptoms of a\ndevelopmental disability are sometimes labeled \"seriously emotionally disturbed.\" \n  PAIR expands on the rights and protections created by PAMII and the DD Act\nand includes individuals with disabilities who do not qualify for services under either of\nthe other statutes.  29 U.S.C. §794e.  If a child diagnosed as \"seriously emotionally\n9\n\ndisturbed\" is disabled for the purposes of section 794e but is not considered\ndevelopmentally disabled for the purposes of the DD Act or to have a mental illness for\nthe purposes of PAMII, that student may be subject to the protections of PAIR.  The\nfact that all HTLA students are diagnosed as \"substantially emotionally impaired\" allows\nan inference that students fall under the protection of either the DD Act or PAIR, both of\nwhich provide OPA with identical investigative powers.  These facts, considered\nalongside HTLA’s concession that its students are \"individuals with mental illness\" for\nthe purposes of PAMII2, establish that OPA has met the standard set forth in Armstrong\nand is authorized by PAIR and PAMII to investigate incidents of abuse or neglect at\nHTLA.  The court need not resolve the parties’ dispute regarding the applicability of the\nDD Act as PAIR provides OPA with the same authorities as does the DD Act.  42\nU.S.C. §794e(f)(1)-(2).\nD. OPA is Entitled to Access to HTLA\n PAIR requires that protection and advocacy systems \"have access at\nreasonable times to any individual with a developmental disability in a location in which\nservices, supports, and other assistance are provided to such an individual.\"  42 U.S.C.\n§15043(a)(2)(H); see 28 U.S.C. §794e(f)(1)-(2) (providing that systems created\npursuant to PAIR \"have the same general authorities, including access to records and\nprogram income, as are set forth\" in the DD Act).  Access under this provision is not\nlimited to access to residential locations.  To the extent that HTLA serves students\ncovered under the DD Act and PAIR, it must provide reasonable access to such\n2Without this concession, the court would have reached the same conclusion based on\nthe record before it.\n10\n\nstudents to OPA.  Because OPA has made a sufficient showing that students at HTLA\nare entitled to its services under PAIR, OPA is authorized to access \"any individual . . .\nin a location\" as is reasonable under the statute. Id.\nRather than provide access to individuals as the DD Act and PAIR do, PAMII\nrequires that protection and advocacy systems \"have access to facilities in the State\nproviding care or treatment.\"  42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(3).  The defendants argue that they\nare not required to provide access to HTLA under PAMII because HTLA is not a\n\"facility\" for the purposes of the Act.  The Act provides that \"[t]he term ‘facilities’ may\ninclude, but need not be limited to, hospitals, nursing homes, community facilities for\nindividuals with mental illness, board and care homes, homeless shelters, and jails and\nprisons.\"  42 U.S.C. §10802(4).  Notably, while the statute does not limit use of the term\n\"facilities\" as such, all of the examples listed are residential institutions.  Implementing\nregulations have defined the term \"facilities\" to include \"any public or private residential\nsetting that provides overnight care accompanied by treatment services.\" \nRequirements Applicable to the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental\nIllness Program, Definitions, 42 C.F.R. §51.2 (2004) (emphasis added). The plaintiffs\nargue that PAMII was recently amended to expand its purview to nonresidential\nfacilities and, the regulations have not yet been updated accordingly.  Pl.’s Reply\nMemo. to Def.’s Objection to Pl.’s Mot. for a Permanent Injunction [Dkt. NO. 14] at 8.  \nThe court notes that PAMII was amended in 2000.  Public Law 106-310\nexpanded the definition of the term \"individual with mental illness.\"  Prior to the 2000\namendment, the term applied only to individuals with \"a significant mental illness or\nemotional impairment\" who were inpatients or residents of facilities providing mental\n11\n\nhealth services, in the process of being admitted to such facilities, or confined in a\ndetention facility.  An individual was not entitled to services under the act unless\nconfined in a residential facility.  \nPAMII’s legislative history supported such an interpretation of the original act. \nThe Labor and Human Resources Committee prepared the 1985 Senate Report which\nlaid out the bases for its recommendation that Public Law 99-319 be passed.  S. REP.\nNO. 99-109 (1985), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1361.  The legislation was drafted in\nresponse to concerns regarding \"the care and treatment of institutionalized persons\nwho are developmentally disabled, mentally retarded, or mentally ill.\"  Id. at 1361.  The\nreport described the results of \"a 9-month staff investigation of conditions in\nstate-operated facilities for the developmentally disabled, mentally retarded and/or\nmentally ill.\"  Id.  According to the report, the bill \"defines 'mentally ill person' to mean\nan individual for whom a primary diagnosis of mental illness has been made and who\nresides for 24 hours each day in a residential facility.\"  Id. \nIn 2000, Public Law 106-310 amended PAMII’s definition of a mentally ill\nindividual to include persons who live \"in a community setting, including their own\nhome.\"  Children’s Health Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-310, codified at 42 U.S.C.\n§10802(4).  The 2000 amendment expanded the definition of a mentally ill individual for\nthe purposes of PAMII.  The Act currently includes in its definition of an individual with\nmental illness a person \"who has a significant mental illness or emotional impairment,\nas determined by a mental health professional qualified under the laws and regulations\nof the State . . . and lives in a community setting, including their own home.\"  42 U.S.C.\n10802(4).  Thus, a protection and advocacy system must serve the needs of both\n12\n\nmentally ill individuals who are institutionalized or otherwise treated in residential\nfacilities and individuals who are mentally ill and live in their own home.  Previously, an\nindividual was considered \"mentally ill\" under the statute only if he suffered such an\nillness and resided in a facility providing treatment.  In effect, the 2000 amendment\nrewrites PAMII’s definition of a mentally ill individual to include anyone with \"a\nsignificant mental illness or emotional impairment, as determined by a mental health\nprofessional\" without regard to where that person resides.  Such person may reside in a\nfacility providing treatment or \"in a community setting, including their own home.\"  \nWhen applying a statute, this court is \"required to ‘disfavor interpretations of\nstatutes that render language superfluous.’\"  Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal v. U.S.\nDept. of the Interior, 228 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Connecticut Nat'l Bank v.\nGermain, 503 U.S. 249, 253 (1992)).  Arguably, the interpretation suggested by OPA --\nthat it is authorized under PAMII \"to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of\nindividuals with mental illness\" pursuant to section 10805(a)(1)(A) regardless of where\nthose individuals reside -- renders part B of section 10802(4) superfluous.  The\ndefinition of an \"individual with mental illness\" might as well be limited to part A of that\nsection, without the conjunction \"and\" used to make additional requirements regarding\nan individual’s residence. \nNevertheless, \"courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it\nmeans and means in a statute what it says there.\"  Connecticut Nat’l Bank, 503 U.S. at\n253-54.  When Congress chose to revise the definition of \"individual with mental\nillness,\" there was more than one way in which to do so.  For example, it could have\nremoved section 10802(4)(B) in its entirety.  Instead, Congress chose to expand the\n13\n\ndefinition by adding a subsection that explicitly adds an additional category of\nindividuals subject to the rights and protections created by the statute.  In the instant\ncontext, it would be clearly contrary to Congressional intent to excise that portion of\nstatute in the interest of avoiding a reading that renders a section superfluous.  It is \"far\nmore likely that Congress inadvertently created a redundancy,\" Connecticut Nat’l Bank,\n503 U.S. at 256 (O’Connor, concurring), or added the subsection to expressly extend\ncoverage, than that it intended to limit its definition of mentally ill individuals to those\nresiding in facilities where the statutory language expressly provides that the definition\nought to include individuals residing in their own homes.  Therefore, PAMII authorizes\nprotection and advocacy systems to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect and\naccess an individual’s mental health records without regard to an individual’s residence. \nSee 42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(1),(4).\nThe more difficult question that remains is whether PAMII authorizes a protection\nand advocacy system to have physical access to a non-residential program providing\ntreatment to mentally ill persons.  The statute requires that protection and advocacy\nsystems, like OPA, must \"have access to facilities in the State providing care or\ntreatment.\"  42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(3).  Current regulations limit the definition of \"facilities\"\nto residential institutions.  42 C.F.R. §51.2 (2004) (\"Facility includes any public or\nprivate residential setting that provides overnight care accompanied by treatment\nservices.\")  Those regulations, however, predate the 2000 amendments to PAMII.  They\nwere released in their final form on October 15, 1997, three years before Congress\namended its definition of individuals with mental illness under PAMII.  See 62 Fed. Reg.\n53548.  They do not, for example, take into account the explicit revision of the definition\n14\n\nof an individual with mental illness and, instead, maintain the pre-2000 definition.  That\nthe regulations have not been revised to address a statutory revision is not unusual. \nBetween the statute’s passage in 1986 and the 1991 amendments, no rules were\npromulgated pursuant to PAMII.  H.R. REP. NO. 102-319 (1991), reprinted in 1991\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 777, 785.  Following 1991 amendments to PAMII that explicitly authorized\nrulemaking by the Department of Health and Human Services, final rules were not\npromulgated until October 1997, six years after those amendments were passed.  See\nRequirements Applicable to Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness;\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, 59 Fed. Reg. 64367-01 (December 14, 1994);\nRequirements Applicable to Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness;\nFinal Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. 53548 (October 15, 1997).  \nNo regulations interpret PAMII in its current and applicable form.  The court\ncannot defer to an agency interpretation that predates relevant amendments to the\nstatute.  Compare Helvering v. Winmil, 305 U.S. 79, 83 (\"Treasury regulations and\ninterpretations long continued without substantial change, applying to unamended or\nsubstantially reenacted statutes, are deemed to have received congressional approval\nand have the effect of law.\").  Therefore, the court must consider the plain language as\nwell as the legislative intent underlying the relevant section, which requires protection\nand advocacy systems to \"have access to facilities in the State providing care or\ntreatment.\"  42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(3).  The statute itself does not limit the term \"facilities\"\nto residential institutions.  Generally, the provisions of section 10805(a) provide\nprotection and advocacy systems with the particular tools necessary to \"protect and\nadvocate the rights of individuals with mental illness.\"  42 U.S.C. §10805(a).  Fulfilling\n15\n\nthe responsibility to \"investigate incidents of abuse and neglect\" and \"pursue\nadministrative, legal, and other appropriate remedies\" requires certain investigative\npowers.  Id.  These powers include access to records, 42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(4),\nindependence from other state agencies, 42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(2), and the ability to\naccess those institutions where individuals with mental illness are treated, 42 U.S.C.\n§10805(a)(3).  If OPA’s mandate is to protect and advocate the rights of all individuals\nwith mental illness, regardless of whether they are treated as inpatients or outpatients,\nits access cannot be limited to residential facilities but must extend to all facilities\ntreating individuals with mental illness.  To exclude facilities treating individuals who live\nin a community setting, including their own home, would be counter to the clear\nlanguage of the statute, as well as its intent.  Thus, HTLA, as a facility providing care or\ntreatment, is subject to access by OPA, pursuant to PAMII’s grant of authority to that\nagency.  42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(4).  Therefore, both PAIR and PAMII entitle OPA to\nphysical access to HTLA. \nE. OPA is Entitled to the Names and Contact Information Sought\nWhile OPA’s access to students’ records is not limited by the fact that HTLA is\nnot a residential institution, that access is limited by statutory provisions that address\nauthorization by an individual with mental illness or a developmental disability or that\nperson’s legal representative.  See 42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(4); 42 U.S.C. §15043(a)(2)(I). \nDefendants argue that OPA cannot, pursuant to its authorizing statutes, access the\nrecords sought from HTLA.  Further, the defendants argue that if the statutes do\nauthorize such access, OPA’s request must nonetheless fail because HTLA and the\nHartford Board of Education are bound by confidentiality provisions in the Federal\n16\n\nEducational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), 20 U.S.C. §1232g, and the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. §1400, et seq.  FERPA limits federal\neducational funding to educational agencies and institutions that follow certain statutory\nmandates with respect to release of information and educational records.  20 U.S.C.\n§1232g.  IDEA requires educational institutions and agencies receiving federal funds\npursuant to that statute to abide by FERPA’s mandates.  20 U.S.C. §1417(c).     \nSection 10805, which authorizes OPA to access a person’s records under\nparticular circumstances, does not define the term \"records.\"  It is sensible under these\ncircumstances to incorporate the definition provided in section 10806, which references\nsection 10805(a)(4) and provides standards regarding confidentiality and disclosure of\nrecords accessed by a protection and advocacy system pursuant to section\n10805(a)(4).  See Pennsylvania Protection & Advocacy, Inc. v. Houstoun, 228 F.3d\n423, 426 n. 1 (3d Cir. 2000).  Section 10806 provides that \n\"records\" includes reports prepared by any staff of a facility rendering care\nand treatment or reports prepared by an agency charged with\ninvestigating reports of incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury occurring at\nsuch facility that describe incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury occurring\nat such facility and the steps taken to investigate such incidents, and\ndischarge planning records.  \n42 U.S.C. §10806(b)(3)(A).  \nOPA concedes that it cannot access staff reports and similar records under the\nrequirements described in section 10805(a)(4).  Instead, it seeks \"directory information\"\nso that it can contact the students’ legal representatives for the purposes of securing\nconsent to review other records.  PAMII allows access to records where OPA receives a\ncomplaint or has probable cause to believe that an individual’s health or safety is in\n17\n\nserious and immediate jeopardy and OPA contacts the student’s representative \"upon\nreceipt of the name and address of such representative.\"  42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(4)(c). \nSimilarly, the DD Act provides for access to records where a developmentally disabled\nindividual has a legal representative; OPA has received a complaint or has probable\ncause to believe that such individual has been subject to abuse or neglect; and OPA\ncontacts the individual’s legal representative, \"upon receive of the name and address of\nsuch representative.\"  42 U.S.C. §15043(a)(2)(I)(iii).  The circumstances under which\nOPA can obtain records are broader under the DD Act and PAIR.  OPA need only have\nprobable cause to believe that abuse or neglect has occurred or is occurring.  Under\nPAMII, OPA must meet a higher burden, requiring it to have probable cause to believe\nthat \"the health or safety of the individual is in serious and immediate jeopardy.\"  42\nU.S.C. §10805(a)(4)(c).  The standard for finding that probable cause exists is lower for\nthese purposes than it would be in the context of a criminal investigation.  Alabama\nDisabilities Advocacy Program v. J.S. Tarwater Developmental Center, 97 F.3d 492,\n498-99 (11th Cir. 1996).  Furthermore, courts have found that the protection and\nadvocacy system, in this case OPA, is the final arbiter of probable cause for these\npurposes.  Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Armstrong,\n266 F.Supp.2d 303, 321 (D.Conn. 2003);  Center for Legal Advocacy v. Earnest, 188\nF.Supp.2d 1251, 1257 (D.Colo. 2002), rev’d on other grounds, 320 F.3d 1107 (10th Cir.\n2003);  Arizona Center for Disability Law v. Allen, 197 F.R.D. 689 (D.Ariz. 2000).  The\ncourt need not determine for these purposes whether OPA is in fact the final arbiter of\nprobable cause because the court’s view is that probable cause exists in the instant\ncircumstance.\n18\n\nThe language of the provisions authorizing access to records is far from clear. \nWere the phrase \"upon receipt of the name and address of such representative\", as\nused in both the DD Act and PAMII, to be construed to mean that a protection and\nadvocacy system be required to contact that representative without HTLA providing the\nname and address, the phrase would be meaningless.  Instead, the court reads the\nphrase to authorize a request by OPA for the names and addresses of students for\nwhom there is the requisite degree of probable cause to demand records under PAMII\nand the DD Act.  Upon receipt of such information, OPA can attempt to contact legal\nrepresentatives of such individuals in order to obtain express permission to act on their\nbehalf.  Regulations promulgated pursuant to both the DD Act and PAMII support this\ninterpretation of the statute.  They use identical language to provide that a protection\nand advocacy system \"shall be provided promptly . . . the name, address and telephone\nnumber of the legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative of an individual”\nwith developmental disabilities or mental illness where the system is denied access to\nfacilities or records “for alleged lack of authorization.\"  State System for Protection and\nAdvocacy of the Rights of Individuals with Disabilities, 45 C.F.R. §1386.22 (2004) (DD\nAct); 42 C.F.R. §51.43 (2003) (PAMII).  \nWhile defendants contest the applicability of either PAMII or the DD Act to HTLA,\nthey concede that the statutes and regulations create a responsibility on the part of an\ninstitution to provide contact information for an individual’s “legal guardian, conservator,\nor other legal representative”, where an institution refuses to release that individual’s\nrecords on the grounds that an individual or his legal representative has not authorized\nsuch release. Id.  The defendants argue, however, that students at HTLA who are not in\n19\n\nstate custody do not have such a legal representative for the purposes of these\nstatutes.  They cite regulations pursuant to both PAMII and the DD Act that provide a\nlimited definition of the terms “legal guardian, conservator, and legal representative.”\nLegal Guardian, Conservator, and Legal Representative all mean an\nindividual whose appointment is made and regularly reviewed by a State\ncourt or agency empowered under State law to appoint and review such\nofficers, and having authority to consent to health/mental health care or\ntreatment of an individual with mental illness.  It does not include persons\nacting only as representative payee, persons acting only to handle\nfinancial payments, attorneys or persons acting on behalf of an individual\nwith mental illness only in individual legal matters, or officials responsible\nfor the provision of health or mental health services to an individual with\nmental illness, or their designees.\n42 C.F.R. §51.2 (2004) (PAMII).  The regulations pursuant to the DD Act are\nsubstantially similar.  45 C.F.R. §1386.19 (2004).\nThe defendants argue that by the plain terms of the regulation, parents of a\nminor do not qualify as a “Legal Guardian, Conservator, [or] Legal Representative.” \nTherefore, HTLA is not required to turn over names and contact information for\nstudents’ parents pursuant to the DD Act, PAMII, PAIR, or any of the regulations\npursuant to such statutes.  \nThe defendants’ interpretation of the regulations is counter to that of the\npromulgating agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The final\nrule appeared in the Federal Register on October 15, 1997.  The accompanying\ncommentary included clarification of the definition of a “Legal Guardian, Conservator,\nand Legal Representative.”  While the Department confirmed that certain persons\nresponsible for mentally ill persons were excluded from the definition, “natural or\nadoptive parents [of minor children] are legal guardians unless the State has appointed\n20\n\nanother legal guardian under applicable State law.”  Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration; Requirements Applicable to Protection and Advocacy of\nIndividuals with Mental Illness; Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. 53548-01, 53552.  Indeed, a\n1991 amendment to PAMII emphasized the role of family members in the protection of\nand advocacy for mentally ill persons.  See 42 U.S.C. §10801(a)(2).  The Committee on\nEnergy Commerce concluded that “the involvement of family members is crucial to the\nsuccessful implementation of the PAMII Act and therefore family involvement should be\nwelcomed and encouraged.”  H.R. REP. NO. 102-319, reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n777, 781.  \nThe defendants argue that their interpretation of the regulations supports their\ncontention that PAMII does provide for services, protection, or advocacy for minors with\nparents who maintain custody and guardianship, but the committee report is counter to\nthat argument.  That report provides that, “P&A staff should involve family members\nwhere the family member with a mental illness is a minor . . . .”  Id.  For the statute and\nits regulations to ignore parents’ roles as legal guardians of their children would run\ncounter to statutory objectives.  On this basis and crediting the agency’s interpretation\nof its own regulation, the court cannot conclude that parents are excluded from the\ndefinition of a “Legal Guardian, Conservator, and Legal Representative.”  PAMII grants \nexpansive powers to protection and advocacy systems to investigate incidents of\nneglect of abuse of individuals with mental illness.  “In this regard, it is no less critical to\naccess the records of those with natural parents as those with legal guardians.  Without\nthe disclosure by the facility of the parents’ names and addresses, it may be impossible\nfor the P&A to contact those parents; at the very least, it might significantly delay the\n21\n\nprocess.”  Advocacy, Incorporated v. The Brown Schools, Inc., 2001 WL 1910563 at *4\n(W.D.Tex. October 1, 2001).\nThe defendants argue that, even if OPA has the right to obtain the information it\nseeks, other statutes prohibit such release of HTLA records.  FERPA provides that \"[n]o\nfunds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency\nor institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education\nrecords (or personally identifiable information contained therein other than directory\ninformation . . .) of students without the written consent of their parents to any\nindividual, agency, or organization . . . .\"  20 U.S.C. §1232g(b)(1).  FERPA’s restrictions\non access to educational records appear to conflict with the DD Act and PAMII’s grant\nof authority to protection and advocacy systems to access such information.  Where the\ncourt \"find[s] no ‘clear and manifest’ indication that Congress intended [one section] to\nrepeal [another], it is our duty to harmonize the provisions, if possible.\"  Auburn Housing\nAuthority v. Martinez, 277 F.3d 138, 150 (2d Cir. 2002).\nThe defendants cite to Washington Protection and Advocacy System, Inc. v.\nEvergreen School District, C03-5062(FDB), to support their contention that, in light of\nFERPA, public schools cannot provide records requested by protection and advocacy\nsystems organized pursuant to the DD Act, PAMII, and PAIR.  In a ruling on a motion\nfor a preliminary injunction, the Washington Protection and Advocacy System court\ndetermined that it was “not sufficiently satisfied that the P&A Acts override the FERPA\nand IDEA.”  Id. at 3.  No rationale was provided for this conclusion.  Furthermore, that\ncourt considered only the plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits, not actual\nsuccess on the merits.  In addition, the conclusion that the Washington Protection and\n22\n\nAdvocacy System had not established a likelihood of success was based not only on\nFERPA and IDEA, but also on that court’s finding that the plaintiff did not have probable\ncause to believe that the child in question had suffered abuse and neglect.  Id. at 5.  \nThe Western District of Michigan, in Michigan Protection & Advocacy Service,\n849 F.Supp. at 1208, supra, section II.C, appears to be the only other court to have\nconsidered the potential conflict between FERPA and IDEA, on one hand, and the DD\nAct and PAMII, on the other.  That court concluded that, given the unequivocal statutory\nmandate afforded to protection and advocacy systems to access records in specific\nsituations and the statutory responsibility of such organizations to keep such records\nconfidential, FERPA and IDEA did not prevent educational institutions and agencies\nfrom providing such systems with records.  Id.  While the defendant urges the court not\nto consider the Michigan ruling persuasive because it addressed only physical access\nto an institution, the court notes that the ruling explicitly addressed documentary\nrecords as well.  Id.\nIn reconciling the two statutes, it is important to note that the OPA is bound by\nstate and federal law regarding confidentiality.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §46a-11h; 42 U.S.C.\n§10806.  State law provides that \"all confidential records obtained by the office in the\ncourse of any such investigation shall be confidential and shall not be subject to\ndisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.\"  Conn. Gen. Stat. §46a-11h.  Federal\nlaw requires OPA to maintain the same standards with respect to confidentiality as does\nthe institution from which it receives records.  \nAn eligible system which, pursuant to section 10805(a)(4) of this title, has\naccess to records which, under Federal or State law, are required to be\nmaintained in a confidential manner by a provider of mental health\n23\n\nservices, shall . . . maintain the confidentiality of such records to the same\nextent as is required of the provider of such services.  \n42 U.S.C. §10806(a).   Thus, PAMII explicitly contemplates those instances in which a\nprotection and advocacy system may request records that are confidential under federal\nlaw, in this case FERPA and IDEA.  In such situations, PAMII requires that a protection\nand advocacy system \"maintain the confidentiality of such records to the same extent\nas is required of the provider\" by the applicable law.  Id.  OPA, therefore, is bound by\nthe confidentiality provisions of FERPA and IDEA upon receipt of any educational\nrecords from the defendants.  To allow protection and advocacy systems access to\nrecords in the limited circumstances provided for in the DD Act, PAMII, and PAIR does\nnot contravene Congress’ intent to maintain parents’ and students’ confidentiality.  In\nthis case, allowing OPA to access parents’ names and contact information serves the\npurposes of all of the above statutes by allowing OPA to pursue its investigation as\nrequired by PAMII and PAIR while limiting its access to records until it receives\nauthorization from students and parents, as is required by FERPA and IDEA.  Thus, the\ncourt is able to harmonize the various statutes.  This reading is preferable to a finding\nthat one or more of the statutes repeals by implication one or more of the others where\nthere is no indication that Congress intended such result.  Thus, pursuant to PAMII and\nPAIR, OPA is entitled to names and contact information for parents and legal guardians\nof students at HTLA. \nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed above, the court declares that the defendants’ refusal\nto provide the plaintiffs with physical access to HTLA when students are present and\n24\n\nwith name and contact information for parents and legal guardians of HTLA’s students\nviolates PAMII and PAIR.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nThe plaintiffs, the State of Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons \nwith Disabilities (hereinafter \"OPA\") and James McGaughey (\"McGaughey\") (collectively \n\"Plaintiffs\") bring this action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  §§ \n10801-10827, the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 \n(PAlM!), the Developmental Disabilities Assi!ltance and Bill of Rights Act (hereinafter \"DD \nAct), 42 U.S.C. § 15041 et ~ and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights \n1 \n\n(hereinafter \"PAIR\") 29 U.S.C. § 794e, et seq.  OPA challenges the refusal of Defendants \nHartford Board of Education (hereinafter \"Board\"), Hartford Public Schools (hereinafter \"HPS\") \nand Robert Henry (hereinafter \"Henry\"), (collectively \"Defendants\") to disclose certain directory \ninfonnation regarding the identity of parents or guardians of students attending the Hartford \nTransitional Learning Academy (hereinafter HTLA), a school operated by Defendants.  That \ndirectory infonnation, which consists of name:>, addresses and phone numbers, would enable the \nPlaintiffs to seek releases from those parents and guardians for the students' educational and \nother records so that OP A may conduct an investigation into serious allegations of abuse and \nneglect of students attending HTLA.  OPA   additionally challenges Defendants' refusal to allow \nOP A access to the HTLA facilities at times that the students are in attendance.  These refusals by \nDefendants prevent OPA, the state and federally designated Protection and Advocacy System for \npersons with disabilities in Connecticut, from fulfilling its statutory mandates of investigating \nallegations of abuse and neglect as well as providing protection and advocacy services for \nindividuals with disabilities.  The actions of the Defendants further prevent OPA from \ndetennining whether the rights of students to be free from abuse and illegal restraint are being \nviolated and whether there are appropriate procedures in place to prevent incidents of abuse and \nneglect. \n2 \n\nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § l331.  Plaintiffs' \nfederal claims are made pursuant to PAIMI, 42 U.S.C.  §§ 10801-10827, the DD Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 15041 et ~ and PAIR, 29 U.S.C. § 794e, et seq.  Declaratory and injunctive relief are \nauthorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202. \n2.  Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § l391(b) as all of the events \nand omissions complained of below occurred in this district. \nIII.  .p ARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff OPA is the Connecticut Protection and Advocacy program designated by the \nGovernor of the State of Connecticut to provide protection and advocacy services to individuals \nwith disabilities.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46a-10.  It is also allotted federal funds pursuant to PAlMI, \nthe DD Act, and PAIR and is thereby obligated to similarly provide protection and advocacy for \npersons with mental illness, developmental disabilities, and individuals with disabilities who are \nnot eligible under PAlMI or the DD Act.  42 U.S.C. §§ 10803 - 04, 42 U.S.C. § 15041 et ~ \n29 U.S.C. § 794e, et seq.  Under these statutes OPA is also authorized to investigate suspected \nincidents of abuse and neglect and to pursue administrative, legal and other remedies on behalf \nof individuals with mental illness wherever programs for such individuals are operated within the \nState of Connecticut or within the state's control.  OPA is located at 60B Weston Street, \nHartford, CT 06120. \n3 \nI. \n--II----·----------------------------~ \n\n4.  Plaintiff James McGaughey is the Exel)utive Director of OP A.  He is authorized to \ninvestigate and bring suit on behalf of persons with disabilities pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. § \n46a-l1. \n5.  Defendant Hartford Board of Education is established pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. § 10-\n218.  Its responsibilities are designated in Conn. Gen. Stat. § 10-220(a) where it is mandated to \n\"maintain good public elementary and secondary schools\" and provide, inter alia, \"a safe school \nsetting.\"  Defendant Board is located at 960 Main Street, 8th floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103. \n6.  Defendant Hartford Public Schools is t:stablished pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. § 10-240. \nIts powers are designated in Conn. Gen. Stat. § 10-241. Defendant HPS is located at 960 Main \nStreet, 8th floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103. \n7.  Defendant Robert Henry is the Superintendent of School of the Hartford Public Schools. \nPursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. §10-157 Henry is responsible for the supervision of the schools and \nserves as the chief executive officer of Defendant HPS.  Henry has executive authority over the \nschool system and the responsibility for its supervision.  As Chief of Staff for the Hartford \nPublic Schools, Henry is responsible for general oversight ofthe operations areas ofthe district, \nincluding Finance and Business Services, Grants Administration, Human Resources, Security, \nBuildings and Grounds and other departments.  He is being sued in his official capacity. \nDefendant Henry maintains offices at Hartford Public Schools, 960 Main Street, 8th floor, \nHartford, Connecticut 06103. \n4 \n\nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n8. Defendants operate the Hartford Transitional Learning Academy.  HTLA is a school \nthat, despite its label of \"transitional,\" functions as a placement of last resort in the Hartford \nPublic School system.  HTLA primarily accepls children who have a label of \"emotionally \ndisturbed\" and who have not experienced success at placements at other schools within the \nsystem, notably their local schools.  Upon information and belief, students who are placed at \nHTLA have disabilities that include mental illness, developmental disabilities, brain injuries and \nother disabilities including cognitive disabilitil:s.  Children also have a documented history of \nchallenging negative behavior.  In order to be placed at HTLA a student and his/her parents or \nguardians need to sign an agreement that permits the use of \"time-out procedures and/or \nrestraints.\"  Students and their parents or guardians must also sign a form permitting the use of \n\"reasonable physical force when [an HTLA staff person] believes it is necessary to (a) protect \nhimsel:f1herself or others from immediate physJical injury; (b) obtain possession of a dangerous \ninstrument or controlled substance upon or within the control of such student or (c) protect \nproperty from physical damage.\"  (Emphasin added.) Attached hereto as Attachment 1.  HTLA \nis located at 110 Washington Street, Hartford, CT  06106 with an additional facility at 150 \nTower Avenue, Hartford, CT 06120.  HTLA is a facility as defined in the DD Act, PAlMI and \nPAIR.  42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(A)(i) and 42 U.S.C. § 10802(4)(B)(ii), 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(2). \n9.  As part of its regular intake process, OPA has received complaints from parents of \nstudents at HTLA.  These complaints have included allegations that the students have been \n5 \n\nsubjected to inappropriate restraint and seclusion at HTLA.  Some of these allegations have \nincluded claims that the students were injured during the restraint process.  Aff. of Centeno at '1[ \n4-10.  Attached hereto as Attachment 2. Upon information and belief, the students had a variety \nof disabilities including mental illness, developmental disabilities, and other cognitive \nimpairments.  On information and belief students were also placed at HTLA with brain injuries. \n10. Students are also placed at HTLA without adequate information to determine what kind \nof programming is required for the student.  For example, OPA learned that students with \nbehavioral issues have not received a functional behavioral assessment to enable Defendants to \ndevelop a behavioral intervention plan.  The only \"plan\" these students have is that contained in \nthe \"Hartford Transitional Learning Academy, Student and Parent Handbook\" at 12.  This \nhandbook sets forth \"Standards of Student BehaviorlBehavior Management Plans.\" Attached \nhereto as Attachment 3. This general plan violates the Individuals with Disabilities in Education \nAct (IDEA) in that it fails to provide an individualized plan for each particular child.  20 U.S.C. \n1414(d)(3)(B).  This violation of IDEA places students at risk of inappropriate restraint and \nseclusion, and thus at risk of abuse and neglect.  Aff. of Garrison at '1[18-20 . Attached hereto as \nAttachment 4. \nII. As a result of the complaints as set forth in paragraph 9 supra and the information set \nforth in paragraph 10 supra, OPA determined that it had probable cause to suspect that these \nstudents with disabilities were being subjected to abuse and neglect.  Based upon this probable \n6 \n\ncause determination OP A decided to undertak,~ an investigation of HTLA pursuant to its federal \nauthority under PAIMI, the DD Act, and PAIR. \n12. In a letter dated February 3, 2004, OPA notified Defendant Henry that investigators from \nOPA   and The Office of the Child Advocate (hereinafter \"~CA\") would be jointly investigating \n\"alleged programmatic deficiencies and violations of students rights.\"  This letter stated that \ninvestigators from both offices would make an initial visit to the HTLA facility located at 110 \nWashington Street on Tuesday, February 10, 2004 at 9:00 am.  The letter further informed \nDefendant Henry that the investigation would include \"policy review, record review, interviews \nand direct observation of practices.\"  OPA and OCA assured Defendant Henry that the \ninvestigators would \"make every effort not to disrupt the educational environment.\"  See Letter \nfrom OPA and OCA to Defendant Henry, February 10, 2004.  Attached hereto as Attachment 5. \n13.  On Tuesday, February 10, 2004 investigators from OPA and OCA arrived at HTLA. \nFaith VosWinkel from OCA and Bruce Garrison from OPA went into the school office at \napproximately 8:30 am, signed in and informed the clerk where they were from and that they \nwished to see Barbara Macauley, the principal ofHTLA.  The clerk asked them to wait.  Aff. of \nGarrison at ~ 8-10 and Aff. ofVosWinkel at ~ 8-10.  Attached hereto as Attachment 6. \n14. When Macauley arrived at the office approximately 25 minutes later, she asked Mr. \nGarrison and Ms. VosWinkel to come into her office where Ms. VosWinkel told Macauley that \nthey were there to initiate an investigation into HTLA.  Aff. of Garrison at ~ 12 and Aff. of \nVosWinkel at ~ 12. \n7 \nJ I - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n15. When Macauley expressed surprise and said she knew nothing about an investigation Ms. \nVosWinkel informed her that a letter had been sent to Defendant Henry.  Aff. of Garrison at ~ 13 \nand Aff. ofVosWinkel at ~ 13. Macauley infonned Mr. Garrison and Ms. VosWinkel that she \nhad not received a letter and asked what kind of investigation they intended to conduct.  Ms. \nVosWinkel told her that they intended only to look at documents relating to policies, procedures \nand program descriptions ofHTLA during this particular visit.  She also stated that they planned \nadditional visits to observe the programs at HTLA and to talk to faculty.  She told Ms. McCauley \nthat they would not be going into confidential student areas on that day.  Aff. of Garrison at ~ 14 \nand Aff. ofVosWinkel at ~ 14. \n16. Macauley stated that before she could let Mr. Garrison and Ms. VosWinkel into the \nfacility she needed to check with her administration.  After leaving her office for approximately \n10 minutes she returned and told them that she had spoken with Assistant Corporation Counsel \nAnn Bird who advised her not to let them into the facility or to review any documents.  She then \nasked them to leave, which they did.  Aff. of Garrison at ~ 16 and Aff. ofVosWinkel at ~ 16. \n17. On or about April 7, 2004 OPA and OCA met with Defendant Henry and Macauley and \nother officials from Defendant HPS and with counsel for the Defendants to try to resolve the \nquestion of access to the HTLA facilities for the purpose of conducting the investigation.  OPA   \nexplained the areas of concern it had and explained its· authority.  OP A asked for directory \ninformation so that it could contact parents and guardians to seek consents for release of \neducational records and OPA renewed its request for access to the facilities.  At the conclusion \n8 \n\nof the meeting, OPA agreed that it would provide a letter to Defendants explaining its authority. \nOn April 12, 2004 OPA   wrote to counsel for Defendants and discussed the various statutes \nwhich provided this authority, and cited to case law.  OPA renewed its request for both directory \ninformation and access to the facilities.  See LI~tter from OPA to Aun Bird.  Attached hereto as \nAttachment 7. \n18.  On May 3,2004 counsel for Defendants responded to OPA's letter and, citing privacy \nconcerns refuted in OPA's letter, refused to allow OPA access to either the directory information \nor the facilities.  See Letter from Bird to OP A.  Attached hereto as Attachment 8. \n19. On July 20,2004 counsel for OPA wrote to counsel for Defendants attempting to resolve \nthe matter and informing Defendants that should the matter not be resolved the case would have \nto be litigated.  Attached hereto as Attachment 9. \n20. Counsel for Defendants responded on July 22, 2004.  In that letter Defendants continued \nto refuse to allow Plaintiffs access to the directory information.  Defendants did state that they \nwould allow Plaintiffs access to the HTLA facility, but only when the students were not present. \nPlaintiffs replied to this letter on July 27,2004 and informed Defendants that this offer was not \nacceptable.  Attached hereto as Attachments 1( ) and 11. \n21. To this date Defendants have allowed OPA only to have access to otherwise public \ndocuments.  OPA was not permitted into the HTLA facilities to review these documents. \nDefendants continue to refuse OP A access to HTLA when the students are present, continue to \n9 \n\nrefuse OPA   access to the directory information, and thus continue to deny OPA   the ability to \nconduct it's lawful investigation. \nV.

My name is Jose Centeno.  I am over 18 years of age and I understand the \nobligations of an oath. \n2.  I have been employed as a Human Services Advocate at the State of \nConnecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities \n(OPA) at 60B Weston Street, Hartford, CT 06120 since 1990.  My area of \nspecialization is Special Education. I have provided advocacy services for \nover 300 families and their children receiving special education and related \nservices throughout the state of Connecticut. \n\n3.  I have a Bachelor of Arts from Northwest College, Kirkland, Washington. \n4.  As part of my work as a Human Services Advocate, I have served children \nwho attended the Hartford Transitional Learning Academy [HTLA] At least \ntwo ofthese children were restJrained and secluded while at HTLA. \n5.  One of these children was restrained on numerous occasions.  He complained \nthat he was treated roughly, and he developed bruises as a result ofthe \nrestraints.  He also reported being held tightly enough to cause pain. \n6.  He also frequently placed in seclusion.  On one occasion he complained that \nhis armed was forced behind his back as he was escorted to the \"time-out\" \nroom. \n7.  On information and belief, he developed panic attacks as a result of the stress \nof this situation. \nS.  Another client also reported being restrained frequently.  This child also \nsuffered from bruising as a result of the restraints. \n9.  I have also heard reports that children served by Padres Abriendo Puertas, an \nagency housed in OP A offices, also reported being restrained.  One such client \nreported on one occasion receiving rug burns on the face due to a prone \nrestraint.  On information and beliefthere are photographs documenting this \nInJury. \n10.  In 2002, on a professional visit to the HTLA facility at 110 Washington \nStreet, I observed a child who was subject to a prone 4-point restraint in the \nmiddle of the school hallway.

BRUCE GARRISON \nBruce Garrison, being duly sworn deposes and says: \nI.  My name is Bruce Garrison.  I am over 18 years of age and I understand the \nobligations of an oath. \n2.  I have been employed as a Human Services Advocate at the State of \nConnecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities \n(OPA) at 60B Weston Street, Hartford, CT 06120 for 17 years.  My area of \nspecialization is Special Education. I have provided advocacy services for \nover 600 families and their children receiving special education and related \nservices throughout the state of Connecticut. \n\n3.  I have a Master's Degree in Education/Special Education from the University \nof Connecticut and have my teacher certification in the areas of regular and \nspecial education. \n4.  During the fall and winter of2003-2004 I was assigned to work as part of a \nteam to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect at the Hartford \nTransitional Learning Academy.  The team doing the investigation included \nstaff from OPA as well as staff from the State of Connecticut, Office of Child \nAdvocate (OCA). \n5.  On information and belief, Both OPA and OCA had received complaints \nalleging abuse and neglect coneeming the misapplication of restraints and \nseclusion at the HTLA facility.  OP A therefore had probable cause to conduct \nan investigation under our federal mandates. \n6.  On information and belief, OP A has authority under those federal mandates to \nvisit the HTLA facility and observe the students in their enviromnent. \n7.  On February 3, 2004 the Executive Director of OPA, James McGaughey and \nthe Child Advocate, Jeanne Mi:lstein, sent a letter to Robert Henry, \nSuperintendent of the Hartford Public Schools informing him that the offices \nwould be conducting an investigation of the HTLA programs.  The letter \nfurther informed Superintendent Henry that investigators would be making \ntheir initial visit to the HTLA facility at 110 Washington Street, Hartford, CT \non Tuesday, February 10 at 9:00 am. \n2 \n\n8.  On Tuesday, February 10, 2004 I met Faith Vos Winkel, an Assistant Child \nAdvocate from OCA, and together we walked to HTLA where we arrived at \napproximately 8:30 am. \n9.  We entered the building and w<~nt directly to the school office where we \nsigned in.  We showed the clerk at the desk our ID's and Ms. Vos Winkel \ninformed her that we were from the Office ofthe Child Advocate and from the \nOffice of Protection and Advoc:acy.  She requested that we meet with Barbara \nMcCauley, the principal ofHTLA. \n10.  We were informed that Ms. Mc:Cauley was not in her office, and we were \nasked to take a seat and wait until she could be contacted. \n11.  While we waited we observed !ltudents, parents and teachers coming and \ngoing into the office.  Although the office was a public area, we heard \nstudents referred to by name.  We also observed a large \"transportation roster\" \nin the main corridor ofthe school that contained student names and bus routes. \nFinally, when we signed into the building, next to the sign-in book on the \ncounter in the school office waH a schedule ofPPT's that were to be held that \nday listed by student name.  Thl~re was no apparent effort to maintain the \nprivacy of students in this public waiting area. \n12.  We waited for approximately 20-25 minutes.  At that time Ms. McCauley \nentered the school office, greete:d us and invited us into her office.  Once \nthere, Ms. Vos Winkel informed her that we were there to initiate an \ninvestigation into HTLA. \n3 \n\n13.  Ms. McCauley expressed surprise, and said that she had not been informed \nthat we would be there that day.  Ms. Vos Winkel informed her that a letter \nhad been sent to Superintendent Henry by OCA and OP A and Ms. McCauley \ntold us that she had not seen the letter nor been told anything about it.  She \nthen asked us what kind of investigation we were there to conduct. \n14.  Ms. Vos Winkel told her that today we wanted to look at documents relating \nto policies, procedures and program descriptions ofHTLA.  She also stated \nthat we would be setting up subsequent visits to observe the programs at \nHTLA and to talk to faculty.  She further informed Ms. McCauley that we \nwould not be looking at confidcmtial records on that day. \n15.  Ms. McCauley continued to express puzzlement as to why we were there.  She \npointed to a large stack of documents and stated that representatives from the \nCenter for Children's Advocacy had just been there to review documents and \nshe asked if we were connected to her investigation.  We informed her that we \nwere not and that we were conducting a separate investigation.  Ms. \nMcCauley then asked who had made the \"referrals',' to us, and Ms. Vos \nWinkel told her that information was confidential, but that OCA had indeed \nreceived complaints. \n16.  Ms. McCauley told her that she didn't have a problem with oUI being there, \nbut that she would have to check with the \"administration.\"  She left her office \nand returned some 10 minutes later.  She informed us that she had spoken \nwith Ann Bird, the Assistant Corporation Counsel, she advised her not to let \n4 \n\nus into the facility until they cculd find the letter.  Ms. McCauley then asked \nus to leave, and we did so without beginning our investigation. \n17.  To this date we have stilI not received permission to return to HTLA, and \nother than receiving certain doc;uments we have unable to conduct our \ninvestigation of the facility. \n18.  As part of my work as a Human Services Advocate at OP A, I learned that \nstudents are placed at Students are also placed at HTLA without having \nreceived a functional behavioral assessment or without having a behavioral \nintervention plan in their record. \n19.  The only \"plan\" these students have is that contained in the \"Hartford \nTransitional Learning Academy, Student and Parent Handbook\" at 12.  This \nhandbook sets forth \"Standards of Student BehaviorlBehavior Management \nPlans.\" This general plan fails to provide a individualized plan for each \nparticular child. \n20.  Based on my experience as a Human Services Advocate and based upon my \neducational experience, the failure to have an individualized behavioral \nintervention plan places students at risk of inappropriate restraint and \nseclusion, and thus at risk of abuse and neglect. \n~2~ \nHuman Services A vocate \n5 \n\n--\\b.. \nSigned and sworn to before me this:;;;\"\"\", day of \n--=:i.\"'-'>\\\"\"''=s~-' \n2004 \n~.~~~'-'<;---\nCommission \n6 \n\n\n\nSTATE OF CONNECTICUT \nOFFICE OF THE CHILD ADVOCATE \nJeanne Milstein  18-20 TRINITY STREET, HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT 06106 \nChild Advocate \nFebruary 3, 2004 \nRobert Henry, Superintendent \nHartford Public Schools \n960 Main Street, 8th floor \nHartford, CT OiSl 03 \nRe:  Hartford Transitional Learning Academy \nDear Superintendent Henry: \nWe are writing to notify you that both the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) and the \nOffice of Protection and Advocacy for Perwns with Disabilities (OP A) have received \ncomplaints regarding the provision of educational and related services to Hartford \nstudents being served in the Hartford Transitional Learning Academy (HTLA) programs. \nWe will be investigating jointly alleged programmatic deficiencies and violations of \nstudent rights pursuant to authority established in sections 46a-13 q and sections 46a-11 \nthrough 46a-13a of the Confiecticut General Statutes, and 42 U.S.C. § 15001 et. seq.; 42 \nU.S.C. § 15043; and 29 U.S.C. § 794(e) et. seq. \nInvestigators from OCA and OPA will be making their initial visit to the 110 Washington \nStreet site ofHTLA on Tuesday, February 10, 2004 at 9 a.m.  We anticipate the \ninvestigation to include policy review, record review, interviews and direct observation \nof practices.

My name is Faith VosW  inkel.  I am over 18 years of age and I understand the \nobligations of an oath. \n2.  I have been employed at the Stat,e of Connecticut Office of the Child \nAdvocate (\"OCA\") at 18-20 Trinity Street, Hartford, CT 06106 since August \n10,2001.  I currently am acting as an Assistant Child Advocate.  In this \nposition, my responsibilities include conducting fatality reviews/investigations \nregarding all unexplained unexpected child deaths and manage most of the \ncasework related to special education issues and children with disabilities. \n\nPreviously, for approximately fifteen years, I worked at the State of \nConnecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities \n(OPA) at 60B Weston Street, Hartford, CT 06120 as an Assistant Program \nDirector, supervising Human S,~rvice Advocates.  For approximately four of \nthose years, I was the Acting Program Director overseeing the investigatory \nand advocacy divisions. \n3.  I have a Bachelor's Degree from the University of Connecticut and currently \nam pursuing a master's degree in social work from the University of \nConnecticut. \n4.  During the fall and winter of2003-2004, OCA and OPA began discussions \nconcerning allegations of program deficiencies, improper restraint and \nseclusion techniques and safety concerns at Hartford Transition Leaming \nAcademy (HTLA).  Numerous high level inter-agency meetings took place to \ndiscuss the manner in which these allegations might be investigated, \nculminating in OCA and OPA entering into a joint investigatory agreement. \nS.  I was assigned as lead investigawr for OCA.  Mr. Bruce Garrison, a Human \nServices Advocate at OP A, was named lead investigator for OP A. \n6.  On February 3, 2004 the Executive Director of OPA, James McGaughey and \nthe Child Advocate, Jeanne Mii:;tein, sent a letter to Robert Henry, \nSuperintendent ofthe Hartford Public Schools informing him that their offices \nwould be conducting ajoint investigation of the HTLA programs.  The letter \nfurther informed Superintendent Henry that investigators would be making \n\ntheir initial visit to the HTLA Dicility at 110 Washington Street, Hartford, CT \non Tuesday, February 10, 2004 at 9:00 a.m. \n7.  In order to conduct a proper investigation ofthe allegations at HTLA, it is \nimperative that we be allowed to observe students in their school environment. \n8.  On Tuesday, February 10,2004 I met Mr. Garrison, and together we walked \nto HTLA, arriving at approximately 9:00 a.m. \n9.  We entered the building and went directly to the school's office where we \nsigned in.  We showed the clerk at the desk our ID' s and I informed her that \nwe were from the Office ofthe Child Advocate and from the Office of \nProtection and Advocacy and rt'quested that we meet with Barbara McCauley, \nthe principal ofHTLA. \n10.  We were informed that Ms. McCauley was not presently available, and we \nwere asked to take a seat and wait until she could see us. \n11.  While we waited we observed students, teachers and other adults coming and \ngoing into the office.  When we signed into the building, next to the sign-in \nbook on the counter in the school office was a schedule of PPT' s that were to \nbe held that day listed by student name.  This schedule was in plain view.  We \nalso observed, in the main corridor of the school, a large \"transportation \nroster\" posted on one of the hallway's walls, that contained students' first and \nlast names, home addresses and bus routes.  I pointed this roster out to Mr. \nGarrison. \n\n12.  We waited for approximately 20-25 minutes.  At that time Ms. McCauley \ngreeted us and invited us into h~r office.  Once there, I informed her that we \nwere there to initiate an investigation into HTLA. \n13.  Ms. McCauley expressed surpri se, and said that she had not been informed \nthat we would be there that day.  I informed her that a courtesy letter had been \nsent to Superintendent Henry by OCA and OPA notifying him of our intention \nto investigate HTLA.  I further :,tressed that this letter was a mere formality. \nMs. McCauley told us that she had not seen the letter nor been told anything \nabout it.  She then asked us what kind of investigation we were there to \nconduct. \n14.  I told Ms. McCauley that today we wanted to look at documents relating to \npolicies, procedures and program descriptions of HTLA.  I also stated that we \nwould be setting up subsequent visits to observe the programs at HTLA and to \ntalk to faculty.  I further informed Ms. McCauley that we would not be going \ninto confidential student record~ on that day, although we would like a tour of \nthe school building. \nIS.  Ms. McCauley continued to express puzzlement as to why we were there.  She \npointed to a large stack of documents and stated that representatives of the \nCenter for Children's Advocacy had just been there to review documents and \nshe asked if we were connected to that investigation.  I informed her that we \nwere not and that we were conducting a separate investigation.

Ms. McCauley then asked \nus to leave, and we did so without beginning our investigation. \n17.  Prior to departing HTLA, I again tried to impress upon Ms. McCauley the \nparameters of the Child Advocate's statutory authority and that we did not \nintend to review confidential material that day. \n18.  To this date we still have not gained access into HTLA in order to properly \nconduct our investigation. \n~~L ~ Vtt-~ I~ \nFaith VosWinkel \nAssistant Child Advocate \nTh \nSigned and sworn to before me thisdO  day of \n-i~'2004 \n~~ \nCommissio~r 0  e Superior Court \nIlACLLlY'een  ~u.l~ \n\n\n\nSTATE OF  CONNECTICUT \nOFFICE OF PROTECTION AND  ADVOCACY FOR \nPERSONS WITH DISABILITIES \n60B WESTON STREET, HARTFORD, CT  06120-1551 \nApril 12, 2004 \nAnn F. Bird \nAssistant Corporation Counsel \nCity of Hartford \n550 Main Street - Room 210 \nHartford, CT 06103 \nDear Ms. Bird: \nIt was a pleasure meeting you on Wednesday, April 7 at the offices of the Child \nAdvocate. I am pleased to provide you with information regarding the federal statutes \nthat govern the work of the Office of Protection and Advocacy.  I am certain that after \nyou review these statutes that you will understand that we have the authority to have \naccess to the facilities that comprise HTLA while the students are present.  Furthermore, \nyou will come to understand that we have the authority to obtain the names of the parents \nand guardians of these students so that we may seek authorization to obtain their records. \nPut more simply, our federal authority supercedes the privacy provisions of the Family \nEducational Rights and Privacy Act [FERPA]. \nAs I mentioned during ourmeeting, there are three statutes that are relevant to the \ninvestigation being undertaken by OCA and OPA.  They are the Protection and \nAdvocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act [PAlMI], 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-\n10807, the Developmental Disabilitie:l Assistance and Bill of Rights Act [DD Act], 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 15041 - 15045, and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act \n[PAIR], 29 U.S.C. 794e.  PAlMI is implemented by regulations at 42 CPR Part 51, and \nthe DD Act at 45 CPR 1386.20-25.  PAIR provides that it shall have the same access \nas the DD Act.  29 U.S.C. 794e (0(2). \nAs a review of the case law will show you, courts have uniformly held that the \nP&A access authorities require facilit:les to permit the P&A to operate with broad \ndiscretion and independence in gaining access to facilities and records for investigative \npurposes.  One case that I would particularly suggest that you read is Michigan \nProtection and Advocacy Service, Inc. v. Miller, 849 F. Supp. 1202 (W.D. Mich. 1994). \nMiller addresses the right of the Michigan P&A to obtain access to a juvenile facility \nand to records of individuals in that f2lCility notwithstanding objections from the \nfacility.  I would also suggest you read Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons \nwith Disabilities v. Armstrong, 266 F. Supp. 2d 202 (D. Conn. 2003).  This case will \nPhm,c:1/860-297-4300. 1/800-842-'1303: TDD: 1/860-566-2102: FAX: 1/860-560-8714 \nwww.state.ct.us/opapd \nINTERNET SITE: \nAll Affirmative Action / Equal Opportfll1iry  Employer \n\ngive you a good idea of how broadly P&A access has been construed by the one \nConnecticut Court that has had the opportunity to do so as yet. \nAgain, I am confident that after a review of the statutes and the case law, we will \nbe permitted to conduct our investigatiion utilizing the full extent of our authority. \nPlease be assured that this office will act with complete discretion and will compl y with \nour requirements to maintain confidential all student information.

Alisberg \nManaging Attorney \nOffice of Protection and Advocacy \nFor Persons With Disabilities \n60B Weston Street \nHartford, CT  06120-1551 \nRe:  HTLA \nDear Attorney Alisberg: \nThank  you  for  your  letter  of April  12,  2004.  Now  that  I have  reviewed  the \nauthorities  provided  in  your  letter  and  conducted  additional  research,  I  remain \nfirmly convinced that neither these nor other legal authorities allow or require the \nHartford Public Schools to provide your office with access to confidential student \nrecords or to the HTLA facility while students are attending. \nOf the statutes you cited, The Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental \nIIlness  Act (PAlMI) would  seem  closest to applying to  HTLA's students.  That \nstatute,  however,  addresses  protection and advocacy for  persons with significant \nmental illness who are inpatient or resident in a facility, or in the process of being \nadmitted to a facility, or incarcerated.  42 CRF Section 51.2.  The HTLA students \ngenerally do not meet this definition, as they are neither inpatient nor incarcerated, \nat least while attending HTLA. \nEven  if PAlMI  did  apply to  the  HTLA  students,  however,  PAlMI  provides that \nP&A may have access to records only under circumstances that do not apply here. \nP&A may have access to records of (a) persons who are clients of P&A and who \nhave  authorized  such  access;  (b)  persons  whose  mental  condition  prevents  self \nauthorization  and  who  have  no  guardian  or  other  representative  who  can  give \nauthorization  and  where  P&A  has a  specific complaint or probable  cause as  to \n\nAttorney Nancy B. Alisberg  Page 2 \nMay 3,2004 \nneglect or abuse; or (c) persons who have guardians or conservators who have not \nresponded to requests for authorization and where P&A has a complaint or probable \ncause to believe there is a serious or immediate threat to health or safety.  42 U.S.C. \nSection 10805(a)(1 )(4).  These conditions do not apply to HTLA students. \nPAlMI also clearly does not require or permit Hartford Public Schools to provide \nP&A with access to the HTLA facility.  Although PAlMI indicates that a P&A may \n\"have access to facilities in the State providing care or treatment\", the regulations \nclearly define \"facility\" to include only residential facilities.  42 CFR Section 51.2. \nHTLA  is  not  a  residential  program  and  does  not  provide  residential  services. \nStudents return to their parents or guardians each day after school. \nSimilarly,  the Developmental  Disabilities Assistance and  Bill  of Rights Act (DD \nAct) does not apply to HTLA students because they do not meet the definition of \npersons  with  a  \"developmental  disability\"  under  the  Act.  42  U.S.C.  Section \n15002(8) defines developmental disability to mean \"a severe, chronic disability of \nan individual that ... results in substantial functional limitations in 3 or more ... \n[defined] areas of major life activity.\"  Although some HTLA students may have \ndevelopmental deficits, these tend to be slight.  Even if some HTLA students did \nhad  developmental  disabilities,  however,  the  DD  Act's  provision  for  access  to \nrecords  is  very  similar  to  PAlMI's  provision,  and  does  not  apply  here,  in  the \nabsence of individualized authorization by a parent or adult student.  See 42 U.S.c. \nSection l5043(a)(2)(I). \nFinally,  the Protection and Advocacy of Individual  Rights Act (PAIR),  provides \nfunding  for  organizations  such  as  yours,  but  does  not  vest  your  agency  with \nadditional powers or authority. \nIn addition, the judicial decisions that you cited,  while  interesting, all  deal with \nsituations very unlike HTLA's because they involve residential facilities, deceased \ndisabled  individuals, or severely disabled people who have no guardians and are \nincapable of seeking assistance or authorizing access to their own records by virtue \nof their disabilities. \nHTLA's  students  are  either  capable  of advocating  for  themselves  or providing \nauthorization  for  access  or have  parents  or other guardians  who  are  capable of \nadvocating and consenting to access.  Nor are HTLA students and their parents so \ndisabled or isolated that they are unable to either seek assistance or to consent to \naccess by P&A.  Obviously, if any HTLA students are clients of P&A and P&A has \nreceived authorization for  release of records, we will  honor those authorizations. \nOtherwise, Hartford may not disclose records or identifY parents or guardians or \n\nAttorney Nancy B. Alisberg  Page 3 \nMay 3, 2004 \nprovide access to students at HTLA b,!cause to do so would violate FERPA and is \nnot mandated by PAlMI, the DD Act or (PAIR). \nThank you for your courtesy and consideration in this regard. \nSincerely, \n~64 \nAnn F.

That \ninvestigatory authority includes the right to have access to the facilities and to the \nrequested directory information.

Alisberg \nManaging Attorney \nState Office of Protection And Advocacy \nFor Persons With Disabilities \n60B Weston Street \nHartford, CT  06120-1551 \nRe:  Access to HTLA Faciliti(:s and Directory Information \nDear Attorney Alisberg: \nThank you for your letter of July 20, 2004.  Your letter's claim that the Hartford \nPublic Schools has refused the Office of Protection and Advocacy access to the \nHTLA facilities is inaccurate.  As you know, during our meeting on April 7, 2004, \nSuperintendent  Henry  made  clear  that  access  to  the  HTLA  facility  and \nadministration (but not students) will be provided at a mutually convenient time \nupon request.  Superintendent Henry asked that communications to arrange such \naccess be made through Acting Superintendent Amador Mojica.  In  fact,  I also \nconfirmed this officer in a letter of April 30, 2004 to Faith Voswinkel, Protection \nand Advocacy's \"co-investigator\" from the Office of the Child Advocate. \nI do not believe Protection and Advocacy has contacted Mr.  Mojica to arrange \nliuch a meeting or access to the facility. \n~s I also indicated during the April 7, 2004 meeting and in my letter to you of \nMay 3, 2004, however, the Hartford Public Schools cannot allow access to the \nstudents themselves, absent individualized authorization, because to do so would \nviolate its obligations under FERP A.  I also provided a detailed explanation as to \nwhy the federal authorizing statutes for the Office of Protection and Advocacy do \nnot authorize such access in my letter of May 3, 2004.  You have not responded to \nmy letter or otherwise indicated disagn:ement with its conclusions. \n\nAttorney Nancy B. Alisberg  Page 2  July 22, 2004 \nYour claim that the Hartford Public Schools has denied the Office of Protection \nand  Advocacy  Directory  information  for  the  parents  and  guardians  of HTLA \nstudents  is  also  puzzling  because  that  information  has  never  actually  been \nrequested.  The only documents that have been requested were requested by the \nOffice of the Child Advocate, and those documents were provided.  Even  if a \nrequest had been made for a list of parents and guardians, however, FERPA   also \nprohibits  the  Hartford  Public SchooLs  from  providing that  data.  The Hartford \nPublic  Schools  has  not  followed  a  practice  of notifYing  HTLA  parents  and \nguardians that their names and addresses would be disclosed upon request, and has \nnot  afforded  them  the  opportunity  to  prevent  that  disclosure.  Under  those \ncircumstances, FERP A prohibits disclosure of the names and addresses of parents \nand guardians. \nSincerely, \n~1U \nAnn F.

Unfortunately, it seems \nthat we will not be able to resolve this matter short of litigation.  OUf access authority to \nfacilities Q:pressly permits us to have access to the individuals who are in the facilities. \nAccess to an empty school is simply far short of the access granted to us under our \nfederal statute&' See 42 C.F.R. § 51.42(b) and 45 C.F.R. § 1386.22(g). \nSecondly, if you reread my,April 12,2004 letter, you will note that we did indeed \nrequest directory information at that time.  Nevertheless, since you have stated that you \nwill not provide that information, further discussion seems fruitless. \nI therefore interpret your letter as refusing to allow us to have the access rights to \nwhich we are entitled. \nVery truly yours, \n~-~ \nNancy B.

Connecticut.\nFebruary 7, 2005.\n652 *652 Nancy B. Alisberg, Paulette G. Annon, State of Connecticut Office of Protection & Advocacy for Persons\nWith Disabilities, Hartford, CT, for Plaintiffs.\nAnn F. Bird, John Rose, Jr., Corporation Counsel's Office, Hartford, CT, for Defendants.\nRULING ON PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR A PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n[DKT. NO. 3]\nHALL, District Judge.\nSeeking declaratory and injunctive relief, the plaintiffs, the State of Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy\nfor Persons with Disabilities (\"OPA\") and its Executive Director, James McCaughey, initiated this action against\nthe defendants, Hartford Board of Education, Hartford Public Schools, and Robert Henry, on August 11, 2004. On\nthat same date, they filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction requesting access to the Hartford Transitional\nLearning Academy (\"HTLA\") and directory information for students and their parents or guardians for the\npurposes of conducting an investigation into allegations of abuse and neglect at HTLA. [Dkt. No. 3]. The plaintiffs\nclaim that, pursuant to certain federal statutes, they are entitled to access facilities treating persons with certain\ndisabilities and mental illnesses for the purposes of investigating allegations of mistreatment or abuse. 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794e; 42 U.S.C. § 15001 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-10827. On August 31, 2004, the parties agreed to merge\nthe request for a preliminary injunction with the plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction. See FED. R. CIV. P.\n65(a)(2). The parties also agreed to stipulate to certain facts for the purposes of the Motion for a Permanent\nInjunction. Stipulations of Fact [Dkt. No. 13]. The court heard oral argument on January 21, 2005. On that date,\nthe defendants withdrew its then-pending Motion to Strike [Dkt. No. 16].\nI. FACTS\nThe parties have stipulated certain facts. The Hartford Transitional Learning Academy is operated by the Hartford\nBoard of Education for the purpose of providing a therapeutic educational program for students who require\nspecial education and related services and who are considered \"seriously emotionally disturbed.\" Stipulations of\nFact [Dkt. No. 13] at ¶¶ 6-7. The plaintiffs allege that they have received complaints that students at HTLA have\nbeen subjected to inappropriate restraint and seclusion and that in certain instances, students have suffered\ninjury as a result. Id. at ¶ 12. The defendants concede that Hartford Public Schools policy allows teachers and\nadministrators at HTLA to \"use reasonable physical force when he/she believes it is necessary to (a) protect\nhimself/herself or others from immediate physical injury; (b) obtain possession of a dangerous instrument or\n653 controlled substance upon or within the control of such student; or (c) *653 protect property from physical\ndamages.\" Usage of Therapeutic Physical Restraint to Maintain Safety [Dkt. No. 13, Ex. B]. As a result of\n\ncomplaints and other evidence, OPA has determined that probable cause exists to suspect that HTLA students\nare subjected to abuse and neglect. Stipulations of Fact [Dkt. No. 13] at ¶ 14.\nUpon making this determination, OPA and the Office of the Child Advocate initiated an investigation of HTLA. Id.\nat ¶ 15. On February 3, 2004, McGaughey and Joanne Milstein of the Office of the Child Advocate wrote to\nDefendant Henry to notify him that they would be investigating complaints received \"regarding the provision of\neducational and related services to Hartford students\" at HTLA. Letter, February 3, 2004 [Dkt. No. 13, Ex. D]. On\nFebruary 10, representatives of OPA and the Office of the Child Advocate went to HTLA. Stipulations of Fact [Dkt.\nNo. 13] at ¶ 17. They were denied access to students and to records. Id. Representatives of OPA and the\nHartford Board of Education and Hartford Public Schools attempted to negotiate a resolution. Disputes regarding\nthe applicability of OPA's authorizing statutes to HTLA, as well as HTLA's ability to provide the information\nrequested by OPA in the face of federal law protecting students' privacy and confidentiality, prevented such\nresolution. See Stipulations of Fact [Dkt. No. 13], ¶¶ 18-22.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. The Standards for a Permanent Injunction and Declaratory Relief\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory relief pursuant to section 2201 of Title 28 of the United States Code. That section\nprovides that \"any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights\nand other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could\nbe sought.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \"[A] court must entertain a declaratory judgment action: (1) when the judgment will\nserve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue, or (2) when it will terminate and afford\nrelief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\" Continental Cas. Co. v.\nCoastal Sav. Bank, 977 F.2d 734 (2d Cir.1992) (citing Broadview Chem. Corp. v. Loctite Corp., 417 F.2d 998,\n1001 (2d Cir.1969)).\nThe plaintiffs also seek a permanent injunction. \"Generally, to obtain a permanent injunction a party must show\nthe absence of an adequate remedy at law and irreparable harm if the relief is not granted.\" New York State Nat.\nOrganization for Women v. Terry, 886 F.2d 1339, 1362 (2d Cir.1989). In addition, the plaintiff must demonstrate\nactual success on the merits rather than a likelihood of success, as is required when a preliminary injunction is\nrequested. Amoco Production Co. v. Village of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 94 L.Ed.2d 542\n(1987).\nCourts have concluded that a protection and advocacy system's inability to meet its federal statutory mandate to\nprotect and advocate the rights of disabled people, see discussion, infra, section II.B., constitutes irreparable\nharm. See Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Armstrong, 266 F.Supp.2d 303, 310\n(D.Conn.2003) (citing cases). Should OPA demonstrate success on the merits, it is clear that there is no\nadequate remedy at law. Id. The only adequate relief would be to require the defendants to allow OPA access to\nHTLA and relevant records pursuant to the relevant statutes.\nB. OPA's Authority Under Federal Statute\n654 The OPA is established pursuant to Connecticut statute \"for the protection and *654 advocacy of the rights of\npersons with disabilities and developmentally disabled persons.\" Conn. Gen.Stat. § 46a-10. It serves as the\nprotection and advocacy system for the purposes of three federal statutes described below, the Developmental\nDisabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act, and the\nProtection and Advocacy for Mentally III Individuals Act. The OPA is bound by state and federal law regarding\nconfidentiality. Conn. Gen.Stat. § 46a-11h; 42 U.S.C. § 10806.\n\n1. The Development Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act\nThe Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (\"DD Act\") provides for federal funding of state\nsystems \"to protect the legal and human rights of individuals with developmental disabilities.....\" 42 U.S.C. §\n15041; 42 U.S.C. § 15042. In order to qualify for such funds, a state must have in place a system that is\nauthorized to provide effective advocacy for and protection of the rights of developmentally disabled persons. 42\nU.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(A). Further, such systems must \"have access at reasonable times to any individual with a\ndevelopmental disability in a location in which services, supports, and other assistance are provided to such an\nindividual\" as well as access to records of developmentally disabled individuals when certain factors arise. 42\nU.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(H)00(I). Where a system is entitled to access to records, such records must be provided to\n97\nthe system \"not later than 3 business days after the system makes a written request for the records involved.\" 42\nU.S.C. § 15043(J)(I). To the extent that developmentally disabled students attend HTLA, see discussion, infra,\nsection II.C, the school is undoubtedly a \"location in which services, supports, and other assistance are\nprovided.\" 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(H)00(I).\n97\n2. The Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act\nThe Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act (\"PAIR\") creates an identical framework with respect to the\nrights of individuals with disabilities. 29 U.S.C. § 794e. PAIR applies to individuals with disabilities who are not\nentitled to protection or services under either the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally III Individuals Act or the\nDD Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794e(a)(1)(B). In order to receive federal funds under PAIR, a state must \"have in effect a\nsystem to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with disabilities\" and such system must \"have the same\ngeneral authorities, including access to records and program income, as are set forth\" in the DD Act. 29 U.S.C. §\n794e(f)(1)-(2). Thus, while PAIR applies to a broader segment of the population of individuals with disabilities, it\nallows protection and advocacy systems the same breadth of investigative and advocacy authority allowed under\nthe DD Act. Again, to the extent that students protected by PAIR attend HTLA, see discussion, infra, section II.C,\nthe school must provide OPA with access to such students.\n3. The Protection and Advocacy for Mentally III Individuals Act\n655 The Protection and Advocacy for Mentally III Individuals Act (\"PAMII\")[1] provides *655 an similar system for the\npurposes of protecting the rights of mentally ill individuals. 42 U.S.C. § 10801-10807. The Act provides for federal\nfunding:\nto assist States to establish and operate a protection and advocacy system for individuals with\nmental illness which will (A) protect and advocate the rights of such individuals through activities\nto ensure enforcement of the Constitution and Federal and State statutes; and (B) investigate\nincidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness if the incidents are reported to the\nsystem or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.\n42 U.S.C. § 10801(b)(2)(B). In order to be eligible for such funding, states must establish systems to \"(1) protect\nand advocate the rights of individuals with mental illness; and (2) investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of\nindividuals with mental illness if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable cause to believe\nthat the incidents occurred.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10803(2). Such systems are authorized to \"investigate incidents of\nabuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness\" and \"pursue administrative, legal, and other appropriate\nremedies to ensure the protection of individuals with mental illness who are receiving care or treatment in the\nstate.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(A)(B). They are entitled to access to records where certain criteria are met. 42\nU.S.C. § 10805(a)(4). Such systems also must \"have access to facilities in the State providing care or treatment.\"\n42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(3).\n\nC. The DD Act, PAMII Act, and PAIR Act Authorize OPA to Investigate\nPossible Abuse and Neglect at HTLA\nCourts have found that protection and advocacy systems need not \"make a threshold showing of mental illness\"\nin order to exercise their authority under PAMII. Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v.\nArmstrong, 266 F.Supp.2d 303, 313 (D.Conn.2003); Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service v. Miller, 849\nF.Supp. 1202, 1207 (W.D.Mich.1994). A denial of access on the grounds that OPA has not made a conclusive\nshowing that HTLA students are individuals with mental illness or developmentally disabled \"prevents [OPA] from\nbringing in their own mental health professionals to ascertain whether any [students] do in fact suffer from mental\nillness. Such conduct ... defeats the very purpose of PAMII and the DD Act to provide effective protection and\nadvocacy services to mentally ill and developmentally disabled persons.\" Michigan Protection and Advocacy\nService, 849 F.Supp. at 1207.\nInstead of requiring conclusive evidence that a particular person or persons qualifies as an individual with mental\nillness or developmentally disabled for the purposes of a protection and advocacy system's authorizing statutes,\ncourts have held that a showing of \"substantial evidence\" must suffice in order for such systems to fulfill their\nstatutory mandate. See id. at 1207. \"`[E]vidence that a facility has previously housed individuals who are mentally\nill, as well as evidence that some current residents may be mentally ill[,] is sufficient under PAMII to merit access\nby [protection and advocacy systems].'\" Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities, 266 F.Supp.2d at\n314 (quoting Kentucky Prot. & Advocacy Div. v. Hall, et al., No. 3:01cv-538-H, slip. op. (W.D.Ky. Sept. 24, 2001))\n(emphasis added).\nIn order to be placed at HTLA, a child must first be designated \"seriously emotionally disturbed.\" Stipulations of\nFact [Dkt. No. 13] at ¶ 7. Defendants concede that \"most HTLA students probably qualify as individuals with\n656 mental illness for *656 PAMII's purposes.\" Def.'s Objection to Mot. for Permanent Injunction [Dkt. No. 12] at n. 11.\nIndeed, PAMII's definition of an \"individual with mental illness\" includes an \"individual who has a significant ...\nemotional impairment.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10802(4)(A). That definition appears to be inclusive of individuals who are\n\"seriously emotionally disturbed.\" Federal regulations define the term \"serious emotional disturbance\" to include\nthe following:\n(1) A condition that has been confirmed by clinical evaluation and diagnosis and that, over a long\nperiod of time and to a marked degree, adversely affects educational performance and that\nexhibits one or more of the following characteristics: (i) An inability to learn that cannot be\nexplained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors, (ii) An inability to build or maintain satisfactory\ninterpersonal relationships with peers and teachers, (iii) Inappropriate types of behavior under\nnormal circumstances, (iv) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with\npersonal or school problems, (v) A general, pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression. (2)\nSchizophrenia, but does not include children who are socially maladjusted, unless it is determined\nthat they are otherwise seriously emotionally disturbed.\nProvision of Early Intervention Services to Eligible Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities and Their Families, and\nSpecial Education Children with Disabilities Within the Section 6 School Arrangements, 32 C.F.R. § 80.3 (2004).\nThe defendants dispute, however, that students at HTLA ought to be considered developmentally disabled for the\npurposes of the DD Act. The defendants provide the Affidavit of Jody S. Lefkowitz, Senior Director for Exceptional\nChildren for Hartford Public Schools, which Affidavit claims that students with severe developmental disabilities\nare not placed at HTLA but are placed at other facilities in and outside of the Hartford Public School system.\nAffidavit of Jody S. Lefkowitz [Dkt. No. 12] at ¶¶ 8-10. In response, OPA provides an affidavit from its Assistant\nProgram Director attesting that of OPA's former and current clients who are or have been students at HTLA,\nmany have been developmentally disabled and that students who present symptoms of a developmental\ndisability are sometimes labeled \"seriously emotionally disturbed.\"\nPAIR expands on the rights and protections created by PAMII and the DD Act and includes individuals with\ndisabilities who do not qualify for services under either of the other statutes. 29 U.S.C. § 794e. If a child\n\ndiagnosed as \"seriously emotionally disturbed\" is disabled for the purposes of section 794e but is not considered\ndevelopmentally disabled for the purposes of the DD Act or to have a mental illness for the purposes of PAMII,\nthat student may be subject to the protections of PAIR. The fact that all HTLA students are diagnosed as\n\"substantially emotionally impaired\" allows an inference that students fall under the protection of either the DD\nAct or PAIR, both of which provide OPA with identical investigative powers. These facts, considered alongside\n[2]\nHTLA's concession that its students are \"individuals with mental illness\" for the purposes of PAMII , establish\nthat OPA has met the standard set forth in Armstrong and is authorized by PAIR and PAMII to investigate\n657 incidents of abuse or neglect at HTLA. The court need not resolve the parties' dispute regarding the *657\napplicability of the DD Act as PAIR provides OPA with the same authorities as does the DD Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794e\n(f)(1)(2).\nD. OPA is Entitled to Access to HTLA\nPAIR requires that protection and advocacy systems \"have access at reasonable times to any individual with a\ndevelopmental disability in a location in which services, supports, and other assistance are provided to such an\nindividual.\" 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(H); see 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(1)-(2) (providing that systems created pursuant\nto PAIR \"have the same general authorities, including access to records and program income, as are set forth\" in\nthe DD Act). Access under this provision is not limited to access to residential locations. To the extent that HTLA\nserves students covered under the DD Act and PAIR, it must provide reasonable access to such students to\nOPA. Because OPA has made a sufficient showing that students at HTLA are entitled to its services under PAIR,\nOPA is authorized to access \"any individual ... in a location\" as is reasonable under the statute. Id.\nRather than provide access to individuals as the DD Act and PAIR do, PMII requires that protection and advocacy\nsystems \"have access to facilities in the State providing care or treatment.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(3). The\ndefendants argue that they are not required to provide access to HTLA under PAMII because HTLA is not a\n\"facility\" for the purposes of the Act. The Act provides that \"[t]he term `facilities' may include, but need not be\nlimited to, hospitals, nursing homes, community facilities for individuals with mental illness, board and care\nhomes, homeless shelters, and jails and prisons.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10802(4). Notably, while the statute does not limit\nuse of the term \"facilities\" as such, all of the examples listed are residential institutions. Implementing regulations\nhave defined the term \"facilities\" to include \"any public or private residential setting that provides overnight care\naccompanied by treatment services.\" Requirements Applicable to the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals\nwith Mental Illness Program, Definitions, 42 C.F.R. § 51.2 (2004) (emphasis added). The plaintiffs argue that\nPAMII was recently amended to expand its purview to nonresidential facilities and, the regulations have not yet\nbeen updated accordingly. Pl.'s Reply Memo, to Def.'s Objection to Pl.'s Mot. for a Permanent Injunction [Dkt.\nNO. 14] at 8.\nThe court notes that PAMII was amended in 2000. Public Law 106-310 expanded the definition of the term\n\"individual with mental illness.\" Prior to the 2000 amendment, the term applied only to individuals with \"a\nsignificant mental illness or emotional impairment\" who were inpatients or residents of facilities providing mental\nhealth services, in the process of being admitted to such facilities, or confined in a detention facility. An individual\nwas not entitled to services under the act unless confined in a residential facility.\nPAMII's legislative history supported such an interpretation of the original act. The Labor and Human Resources\nCommittee prepared the 1985 Senate Report which laid out the bases for its recommendation that Public Law\n99-319 be passed. S. REP. No. 99-109 (1985), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1361. The legislation was drafted\nin response to concerns regarding \"the care and treatment of institutionalized persons who are developmentally\ndisabled, mentally retarded, or mentally ill.\" Id. at 1361. The report described the results of \"a 9-month staff\ninvestigation of conditions in state-operated facilities for the developmentally disabled, mentally retarded and/or\n658 mentally ill.\" Id. According *658 to the report, the bill \"defines `mentally ill person' to mean an individual for whom\na primary diagnosis of mental illness has been made and who resides for 24 hours each day in a residential\nfacility.\" Id.\nIn 2000, Public Law 106-310 amended PAMII's definition of a mentally ill individual to include persons who live \"in\na community setting, including their own home.\" Children's Health Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-310, codified at 42\n\nU.S.C. § 10802(4). The 2000 amendment expanded the definition of a mentally ill individual for the purposes of\nPAMII. The Act currently includes in its definition of an individual with mental illness a person \"who has a\nsignificant mental illness or emotional impairment, as determined by a mental health professional qualified under\nthe laws and regulations of the State ... and lives in a community setting, including their own home.\" 42 U.S.C.\n10802(4). Thus, a protection and advocacy system must serve the needs of both mentally ill individuals who are\ninstitutionalized or otherwise treated in residential facilities and individuals who are mentally ill and live in their\nown home. Previously, an individual was considered \"mentally ill\" under the statute only if he suffered such an\nillness and resided in a facility providing treatment. In effect, the 2000 amendment rewrites PAMII's definition of a\nmentally ill individual to include anyone with \"a significant mental illness or emotional impairment, as determined\nby a mental health professional\" without regard to where that person resides. Such person may reside in a facility\nproviding treatment or \"in a community setting, including their own home.\"\nWhen applying a statute, this court is \"required to `disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language\nsuperfluous.'\" Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal v. U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 228 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting \nConnecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992)). Arguably, the\ninterpretation suggested by OPA00that it is authorized under PAMII \"to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect\n97\nof individuals with mental illness\" pursuant to section 10805(a)(1)(A) regardless of where those individuals\nreside00 renders part B of section 10802(4) superfluous. The definition of an \"individual with mental illness\" might\n97\nas well be limited to part A of that section, without the conjunction \"and\" used to make additional requirements\nregarding an individual's residence.\nNevertheless, \"courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute\nwhat it says there.\" Connecticut Nat'l Bank, 503 U.S. at 253-54, 112 S.Ct. 1146. When Congress chose to revise\nthe definition of \"individual with mental illness,\" there was more than one way in which to do so. For example, it\ncould have removed section 10802(4)(B) in its entirety. Instead, Congress chose to expand the definition by\nadding a subsection that explicitly adds an additional category of individuals subject to the rights and protections\ncreated by the statute. In the instant context, it would be clearly contrary to Congressional intent to excise that\nportion of statute in the interest of avoiding a reading that renders a section superfluous. It is \"far more likely that\nCongress inadvertently created a redundancy,\" Connecticut Nat'l Bank, 503 U.S. at 256, 112 S.Ct. 1146\n(O'Connor, concurring), or added the subsection to expressly extend coverage, than that it intended to limit its\ndefinition of mentally ill individuals to those residing in facilities where the statutory language expressly provides\nthat the definition ought to include individuals residing in their own homes. Therefore, PAMII authorizes protection\n659 and advocacy systems to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect and access an individual's *659 mental\nhealth records without regard to an individual's residence. See 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1),(4).\nThe more difficult question that remains is whether PAMII authorizes a protection and advocacy system to have\nphysical access to a non-residential program providing treatment to mentally ill persons. The statute requires that\nprotection and advocacy systems, like OPA, must \"have access to facilities in the State providing care or\ntreatment.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(3). Current regulations limit the definition of \"facilities\" to residential institutions.\n42 C.F.R. § 51.2 (2004) (\"Facility includes any public or private residential setting that provides overnight care\naccompanied by treatment services.\") Those regulations, however, predate the 2000 amendments to PAMII.\nThey were released in their final form on October 15, 1997, three years before Congress amended its definition\nof individuals with mental illness under PAMII. See 62 Fed.Reg. 53548. They do not, for example, take into\naccount the explicit revision of the definition of an individual with mental illness and, instead, maintain the\npre-2000 definition. That the regulations have not been revised to address a statutory revision is not unusual.\nBetween the statute's passage in 1986 and the 1991 amendments, no rules were promulgated pursuant to PMII.\nH.R. REP. No. 102-319 (1991), reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 777, 785. Following 1991 amendments to PAMII\nthat explicitly authorized rulemaking by the Department of Health and Human Services, final rules were not\npromulgated until October 1997, six years after those amendments were passed. See Requirements Applicable\nto Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness; Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 59 Fed. Reg.\n64367-01 (December 14, 1994); Requirements Applicable to Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental\nIllness; Final Rule, 62 Fed.Reg. 53548 (October 15, 1997).\nNo regulations interpret PAMII in its current and applicable form. The court cannot defer to an agency\ninterpretation that predates relevant amendments to the statute. Compare Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U.S. 79, 83,\n\n59 S.Ct. 45, 83 L.Ed. 52 (1938) (\"Treasury regulations and interpretations long continued without substantial\nchange, applying to unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are deemed to have received congressional\napproval and have the effect of law.\"). Therefore, the court must consider the plain language as well as the\nlegislative intent underlying the relevant section, which requires protection and advocacy systems to \"have\naccess to facilities in the State providing care or treatment.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(3). The statute itself does not\nlimit the term \"facilities\" to residential institutions. Generally, the provisions of section 10805(a) provide protection\nand advocacy systems with the particular tools necessary to \"protect and advocate the rights of individuals with\nmental illness.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a). Fulfilling the responsibility to \"investigate incidents of abuse and neglect\"\nand \"pursue administrative, legal, and other appropriate remedies\" requires certain investigative powers. Id.\nThese powers include access to records, 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4), independence from other state agencies, 42\nU.S.C. § 10805(a)(2), and the ability to access those institutions where individuals with mental illness are treated,\n42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(3). If OPA's mandate is to protect and advocate the rights of all individuals with mental\nillness, regardless of whether they are treated as inpatients or outpatients, its access cannot be limited to\nresidential facilities but must extend to all facilities treating individuals with mental illness. To exclude facilities\n660 treating individuals *660 who live in a community setting, including their own home, would be counter to the clear\nlanguage of the statute, as well as its intent. Thus, HTLA, as a facility providing care or treatment, is subject to\naccess by OPA, pursuant to PMII's grant of authority to that agency. 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4). Therefore, both\nPAIR and PAMII entitle OPA to physical access to HTLA.\nE. OPA is Entitled to the Names and Contact Information Sought\nWhile OPA's access to students' records is not limited by the fact that HTLA is not a residential institution, that\naccess is limited by statutory provisions that address authorization by an individual with mental illness or a\ndevelopmental disability or that person's legal representative. See 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4); 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)\n(2)(I). Defendants argue that OPA cannot, pursuant to its authorizing statutes, access the records sought from\nHTLA. Further, the defendants argue that if the statutes do authorize such access, OPA's request must\nnonetheless fail because HTLA and the Hartford Board of Education are bound by confidentiality provisions in the\nFederal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, and the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq. FERPA limits federal educational funding to educational\nagencies and institutions that follow certain statutory mandates with respect to release of information and\neducational records. 20 U.S.C. § 1232g. IDEA requires educational institutions and agencies receiving federal\nfunds pursuant to that statute to abide by FERPA's mandates. 20 U.S.C. § 1417(c).\nSection 10805, which authorizes OPA to access a person's records under particular circumstances, does not\ndefine the term \"records.\" It is sensible under these circumstances to incorporate the definition provided in\nsection 10806, which references section 10805(a)(4) and provides standards regarding confidentiality and\ndisclosure of records accessed by a protection and advocacy system pursuant to section 10805(a)(4). See \nPennsylvania Protection & Advocacy, Inc. v. Houstoun, 228 F.3d 423, 426 n. 1 (3d Cir.2000). Section 10806\nprovides that\n\"records\" includes reports prepared by any staff of a facility rendering care and treatment or\nreports prepared by an agency charged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse, neglect,\nand injury occurring at such facility that describe incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury occurring\nat such facility and the steps taken to investigate such incidents, and discharge planning records.\n42 U.S.C. § 10806(b)(3)(A).\nOPA concedes that it cannot access staff reports and similar records under the requirements described in section\n10805(a)(4). Instead, it seeks \"directory information\" so that it can contact the students' legal representatives for\nthe purposes of securing consent to review other records. PAMII allows access to records where OPA receives a\ncomplaint or has probable cause to believe that an individual's health or safety is in serious and immediate\njeopardy and OPA contacts the student's representative \"upon receipt of the name and address of such\nrepresentative.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4)(c). Similarly, the DD Act provides for access to records where a\ndevelopmentally disabled individual has a legal representative; OPA has received a complaint or has probable\n\ncause to believe that such individual has been subject to abuse or neglect; and OPA contacts the individual's\nlegal representative, \"upon receive of the name and address of such representative.\" 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I)\n661 (iii). The circumstances under which OPA can obtain records *661 are broader under the DD Act and PAIR. OPA\nneed only have probable cause to believe that abuse or neglect has occurred or is occurring. Under PAMII, OPA\nmust meet a higher burden, requiring it to have probable cause to believe that \"the health or safety of the\nindividual is in serious and immediate jeopardy.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4)(c). The standard for finding that\nprobable cause exists is lower for these purposes than it would be in the context of a criminal investigation. \nAlabama Disabilities Advocacy Program v. J.S. Tarwater Developmental Center, 97 F.3d 492, 498-99 (11th\nCir.1996). Furthermore, courts have found that the protection and advocacy system, in this case OPA, is the final\narbiter of probable cause for these purposes. Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Armstrong,\n266 F.Supp.2d 303, 321 (D.Conn. 2003); Center for Legal Advocacy v. Earnest, 188 F.Supp.2d 1251, 1257\n(D.Colo. 2002),rev'd on other grounds,320 F.3d 1107 (10th Cir.2003); Arizona Center for Disability Law v. Allen,\n197 F.R.D. 689 (D.Ariz.2000). The court need not determine for these purposes whether OPA is in fact the final\narbiter of probable cause because the court's view is that probable cause exists in the instant circumstance.\nThe language of the provisions authorizing access to records is far from clear. Were the phrase \"upon receipt of\nthe name and address of such representative\", as used in both the DD Act and PAMII, to be construed to mean\nthat a protection and advocacy system be required to contact that representative without HTLA providing the\nname and address, the phrase would be meaningless. Instead, the court reads the phrase to authorize a request\nby OPA for the names and addresses of students for whom there is the requisite degree of probable cause to\ndemand records under PAMII and the DD Act. Upon receipt of such information, OPA can attempt to contact legal\nrepresentatives of such individuals in order to obtain express permission to act on their behalf. Regulations\npromulgated pursuant to both the DD Act and PAMII support this interpretation of the statute. They use identical\nlanguage to provide that a protection and advocacy system \"shall be provided promptly ... the name, address and\ntelephone number of the legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative of an individual\" with\ndevelopmental disabilities or mental illness where the system is denied access to facilities or records \"for alleged\nlack of authorization.\" State System for Protection and Advocacy of the Rights of Individuals with Disabilities, 45\nC.F.R. § 1386.22 (2004) (DD Act); 42 C.F.R. § 51.43 (2003) (PAMII).\nWhile defendants contest the applicability of either PAMII or the DD Act to HTLA, they concede that the statutes\nand regulations create a responsibility on the part of an institution to provide contact information for an\nindividual's \"legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative\", where an institution refuses to release\nthat individual's records on the grounds that an individual or his legal representative has not authorized such\nrelease. Id. The defendants argue, however, that students at HTLA who are not in state custody do not have such\na legal representative for the purposes of these statutes. They cite regulations pursuant to both PAMII and the\nDD Act that provide a limited definition of the terms \"legal guardian, conservator, and legal representative.\"\nLegal Guardian, Conservator, and Legal Representative all mean an individual whose\nappointment is made and regularly reviewed by a State court or agency empowered under State\nlaw to appoint and review such officers, and having authority to consent to health/mental health\n662 care or treatment of an individual *662 with mental illness. It does not include persons acting only\nas representative payee, persons acting only to handle financial payments, attorneys or persons\nacting on behalf of an individual with mental illness only in individual legal matters, or officials\nresponsible for the provision of health or mental health services to an individual with mental\nillness, or their designees.\n42 C.F.R. § 51.2 (2004) (PAMII). The regulations pursuant to the DD Act are substantially similar. 45 C.F.R. §\n1386.19 (2004).\nThe defendants argue that by the plain terms of the regulation, parents of a minor do not qualify as a \"Legal\nGuardian, Conservator, [or] Legal Representative.\" Therefore, HTLA is not required to turn over names and\ncontact information for students' parents pursuant to the DD Act, PAMII, PAIR, or any of the regulations pursuant\nto such statutes.\nThe defendants' interpretation of the regulations is counter to that of the promulgating agency, the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The final rule appeared in the Federal Register on October 15, 1997.\n\nThe accompanying commentary included clarification of the definition of a \"Legal Guardian, Conservator, and\nLegal Representative.\" While the Department confirmed that certain persons responsible for mentally ill persons\nwere excluded from the definition, \"natural or adoptive parents [of minor children] are legal guardians unless the\nState has appointed another legal guardian under applicable State law.\" Substance Abuse and Mental Health\nServices Administration; Requirements Applicable to Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness;\nFinal Rule, 62 Fed.Reg. 53548-01, 53552. Indeed, a 1991 amendment to PMII emphasized the role of family\nmembers in the protection of and advocacy for mentally ill persons. See 42 U.S.C. § 10801(a)(2). The Committee\non Energy Commerce concluded that \"the involvement of family members is crucial to the successful\nimplementation of the PAMII Act and therefore family involvement should be welcomed and encouraged.\" H.R.\nREP. NO. 102-319, reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 777, 781.\nThe defendants argue that their interpretation of the regulations supports their contention that PAMII does provide\nfor services, protection, or advocacy for minors with parents who maintain custody and guardianship, but the\ncommittee report is counter to that argument. That report provides that, \"P & A staff should involve family\nmembers where the family member with a mental illness is a minor....\" Id. For the statute and its regulations to\nignore parents' roles as legal guardians of their children would run counter to statutory objectives. On this basis\nand crediting the agency's interpretation of its own regulation, the court cannot conclude that parents are\nexcluded from the definition of a \"Legal Guardian, Conservator, and Legal Representative.\" PAMII grants\nexpansive powers to protection and advocacy systems to investigate incidents of neglect of abuse of individuals\nwith mental illness. \"In this regard, it is no less critical to access the records of those with natural parents as\nthose with legal guardians. Without the disclosure by the facility of the parents' names and addresses, it may be\nimpossible for the P & A to contact those parents; at the very least, it might significantly delay the process.\" \nAdvocacy, Incorporated v. The Brown Schools, Inc., 2001 WL 1910563 at *4 (W.D.Tex. Oct. 1, 2001).\nThe defendants argue that, even if OPA has the right to obtain the information it seeks, other statutes prohibit\n663 such release of HTLA records. FERPA provides that \"[n]o funds shall be made available *663 under any\napplicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the\nrelease of education records (or personally identifiable information contained therein other than directory\ninformation ...) of students without the written consent of their parents to any individual, agency, or organization\n....\" 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b)(1). FERPA's restrictions on access to educational records appear to conflict with the\nDD Act and PAMII's grant of authority to protection and advocacy systems to access such information. Where the\ncourt \"find[s] no `clear and manifest' indication that Congress intended [one section] to repeal [another], it is our\nduty to harmonize the provisions, if possible.\" Auburn Housing Authority v. Martinez, 277 F.3d 138, 150 (2d\nCir.2002).\nThe defendants cite to Washington Protection and Advocacy System. Inc. v. Evergreen School District, C03-5062\n(FDB), to support their contention that, in light of FERPA, public schools cannot provide records requested by\nprotection and advocacy systems organized pursuant to the DD Act, PAMII, and PAIR. In a ruling on a motion for\na preliminary injunction, the Washington Protection and Advocacy System court determined that it was \"not\nsufficiently satisfied that the P & A Acts override the FERPA and IDEA.\" Id. at 3. No rationale was provided for this\nconclusion. Furthermore, that court considered only the plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits, not actual\nsuccess on the merits. In addition, the conclusion that the Washington Protection and Advocacy System had not\nestablished a likelihood of success was based not only on FERPA and IDEA, but also on that court's finding that\nthe plaintiff did not have probable cause to believe that the child in question had suffered abuse and neglect. Id.\nat 5.\nThe Western District of Michigan, in Michigan Protection & Advocacy Service, 849 F.Supp. at 1208,supra,\nsection II.C, appears to be the only other court to have considered the potential conflict between FERPA and\nIDEA, on one hand, and the DD Act and PAMII, on the other. That court concluded that, given the unequivocal\nstatutory mandate afforded to protection and advocacy systems to access records in specific situations and the\nstatutory responsibility of such organizations to keep such records confidential, FERPA and IDEA did not prevent\neducational institutions and agencies from providing such systems with records. Id. While the defendant urges\nthe court not to consider the Michigan ruling persuasive because it addressed only physical access to an\ninstitution, the court notes that the ruling explicitly addressed documentary records as well. Id.\n\nIn reconciling the two statutes, it is important to note that the OPA is bound by state and federal law regarding\nconfidentiality. Conn. Gen.Stat. § 46a-11h; 42 U.S.C. § 10806. State law provides that \"all confidential records\nobtained by the office in the course of any such investigation shall be confidential and shall not be subject to\ndisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.\" Conn. Gen.Stat. § 46a-11h. Federal law requires OPA to\nmaintain the same standards with respect to confidentiality as does the institution from which it receives records.\nAn eligible system which, pursuant to section 10805(a)(4) of this title, has access to records\nwhich, under Federal or State law, are required to be maintained in a confidential manner by a\nprovider of mental health services, shall ... maintain the confidentiality of such records to the same\nextent as is required of the provider of such services.\n42 U.S.C. § 10806(a). Thus, PAMII explicitly contemplates those instances in which a protection and advocacy\n664 system *664 may request records that are confidential under federal law, in this case FERPA and IDEA. In such\nsituations, PAMII requires that a protection and advocacy system \"maintain the confidentiality of such records to\nthe same extent as is required of the provider\" by the applicable law. Id. OPA, therefore, is bound by the\nconfidentiality provisions of FERPA and IDEA upon receipt of any educational records from the defendants. To\nallow protection and advocacy systems access to records in the limited circumstances provided for in the DD Act,\nPAMII, and PAIR does not contravene Congress' intent to maintain parents' and students' confidentiality. In this\ncase, allowing OPA to access parents' names and contact information serves the purposes of all of the above\nstatutes by allowing OPA to pursue its investigation as required by PAMII and PAIR while limiting its access to\nrecords until it receives authorization from students and parents, as is required by FERPA and IDEA. Thus, the\ncourt is able to harmonize the various statutes. This reading is preferable to a finding that one or more of the\nstatutes repeals by implication one or more of the others where there is no indication that Congress intended\nsuch result. Thus, pursuant to PAMII and PAIR, OPA is entitled to names and contact information for parents and\nlegal guardians of students at HTLA.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed above, the court declares that the defendants' refusal to provide the plaintiffs with\nphysical access to HTLA when students are present and with name and contact information for parents and legal\nguardians of HTLA's students violates PAMII and PAIR. The defendants are hereby ordered to grant both\nphysical access and names and contact information such that OPA can perform its statutory duty to investigate\nsuspected abuse and neglect. The case is closed. The court retains jurisdiction to ensure compliance.\nSO ORDERED\n[1] The parties sometimes refer to the Act as PAIMI. While 1988 amendments removed from the Act all use of the\nterm \"mentally ill individuals\" and, instead, substituted \"individuals with mental illness,\" the name of the Act itself\nwas not changed. See Requirements Applicable to Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness;\nFinal Rule, 62 Fed.Reg. 53548-01 (Oct. 15, 1997). Therefore, the Act will be referred to as \"PAMII\" in this Ruling.\n[2] Without this concession, the court would have reached the same conclusion based on the record before it.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

For the reasons that follow, we hold that the P & A Acts authorize OPA to access the Academy during\nschool hours and to obtain a directory of students and contact information for their parents or guardians.\nDefendants-appellants Hartford Board of Education, Hartford Public Schools, and Superintendent of Schools\nRobert Henry (collectively, \"defendants\") initially argued on appeal that, even if the P & A Acts authorize OPA to\naccess the Academy and its students and to obtain a list of students and contact information for their parents or\nguardians, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g (2000 & Supp. IV), and\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487 (2000 & Supp. IV), nonetheless\nbar their compliance with OPA's requests. Following oral argument and the submission of a joint amicus brief by\n\nthe United States Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, however, defendants abandoned\ntheir arguments based on FERPA and the IDEA, and we therefore do not address them. We affirm the injunction.\nBACKGROUND\nI. Factual Background\nThe Academy is a public school in Hartford, Connecticut, that is under defendants' authority. The Academy\nprovides a \"therapeutic educational program\" for children who are seriously emotionally disturbed and who\npresent challenging behavioral problems. All students enrolled at the Academy have been identified as requiring\nspecial education or related services under the IDEA. The parents or guardians of students enrolled there are\nrequired to sign a document acknowledging the school's use of physical restraints and seclusion.\nOPA is a state-created agency that is authorized to investigate suspected abuse or neglect of individuals with\ndisabilities or mental illness in Connecticut and to advocate on their behalf. See Conn. Gen.Stat. §§ 46a-10 to\n46a-11 (2004). It serves as Connecticut's protection and advocacy system (\"P & A system\") for purposes of\nPAIMI, 42 U.S.C. § 10801(b)(2), the DD Act, id. § 15043(a), and PAIR, 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f), which provide federal\nfunding only for states with qualifying P & A systems that monitor the care of and advocate on behalf of\nindividuals with mental illness and developmental or other disabilities. See 29 U.S.C. § 794e(a)(1), (f); 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 10801, 15001.\nOPA alleges that it received complaints from parents of students at the Academy about the inappropriate use of\n[2]\nphysical restraints and seclusion at the school.  Parents also complained that students had been injured during\n234 the restraint process. *234 As a result of these complaints, as well as allegations that students had been placed\nat the Academy without proper behavioral assessments or adequate individualized educational plans as required\nby the IDEA, OPA determined that it had probable cause to suspect that Academy students had been, or were at\nrisk of being, subject to abuse and neglect. In conjunction with the State of Connecticut Office of the Child\nAdvocate (\"OCA\"), OPA opened an investigation into possible abuse and neglect at the Academy. OCA is a state-\ncreated agency charged with monitoring services provided to children by the State of Connecticut or by\norganizations, such as school districts, that receive state funds, and with reviewing complaints about those\nservices. See Conn. Gen.Stat. § 46a-131(a)(1)-(3) (2004).\nOn February 3, 2004, OPA and OCA sent Superintendent Henry a letter informing him that they had received\ncomplaints about the treatment of students at the Academy and would be investigating the alleged \"programmatic\ndeficiencies and violations of student rights\" pursuant to their authority under federal and state law. The letter\nfurther informed Superintendent Henry that OPA and OCA intended to make an initial visit to the Academy at nine\no'clock on the morning of February 10, 2004, and that the investigation would include \"policy review, record\nreview, interviews and direct observation of practices.\"\nOn February 10, 2004, representatives from OPA and OCA visited the Academy as promised. The Academy\nrefused them access to the facility, the students, and the documents they had requested. Representatives from\nOPA, OCA, and defendants, including Superintendent Henry, met to discuss the matter on April 7, 2004. At the\nmeeting, defendants agreed to, and later did, provide certain documents to OPA and OCA. These documents,\nhowever, did not contain any personal information regarding Academy students. Specifically, defendants did not\nprovide the directory information 00 a list of students and contact information for their parents or guardians 00 that\n97 97\nOPA sought. Defendants also refused to allow OPA and OCA access to the Academy during school hours to\nobserve or interview students. They claimed that access to students and the disclosure of directory information\nwas not authorized by the P & A Acts and was prohibited by FERPA and the IDEA.\nII. Procedural History\nA. The District Court\nOn August 11, 2004, OPA filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Janet C. Hall,\nJ.) seeking (1) a declaration that it was entitled to observe and interview students at the Academy during school\n\nhours and to obtain a list of the names and contact information for all the students and their parents and (2) a\ncorresponding injunction. Because the parties stipulated to the relevant facts, the district court consolidated the\nhearings on the preliminary and permanent injunctions. See Conn. Office of Prot. & Advocacy for Persons with \nDisabilities v. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 355 F.Supp.2d 649, 652 (D.Conn.2005) (\"OPA\").\nIn a thorough and thoughtful opinion, the district court granted the relief OPA sought. Courts have concluded that\na P & A system's inability to meet its federal statutory mandate to protect and advocate for the rights of\nindividuals with disabilities is an irreparable harm for purposes of injunctive relief. Id. at 653. With respect to the\n235 merits, the district court first concluded that the Academy students fall within the protections of the P & A Acts \n*235 on the basis of defendants' concession that most students would be classified as individuals with mental\nillness within the definition of PAIMI, and OPA's reasonable belief that some, if not most, of the students had\ndevelopmental or other disabilities given that all the students are diagnosed as \"substantially emotionally\nimpaired\" and in need of special education and related services. Id. at 665-66. The court next held that the\nAcademy was a \"facility\" under PAIMI that OPA is authorized to access. Id. at 657-60. In doing so, the court\nrejected defendants' assertion that PAIMI does not apply to non-residential facilities or to individuals with\ndisabilities who live at home. Id. at 658-59.\nThe court further held that, under the P & A Acts, OPA is entitled to a list of students and the contact information\nfor their parents or guardians. Id. at 661-64. The court concluded that a minor student's parents can be\nconsidered his or her \"legal guardian[s]\" for purposes of the P & A Acts so that OPA can contact them in order to\nsecure consent to view that student's records. Id. at 661-62. Finally, the district court held that neither FERPA nor\nthe IDEA bars OPA from obtaining the names and contact information of students and their parents or guardians. \nId. at 662-63.\nThe district court thus declared that defendants' refusal to provide OPA with the names and phone numbers of\nAcademy students violated PAIMI, PAIR and the DD Act. It entered a permanent injunction ordering defendants\n\"to grant both physical access and names and contact information such that OPA can perform its statutory duty to\ninvestigate suspected abuse and neglect.\" Id. at 664.\nDefendants thereafter filed this timely appeal, but they did not seek a stay of the injunction and have complied\nwith its terms.\nB. The Appeal\nOn appeal, defendants assert that the district court erred in concluding that the Academy is a \"facility\" to which\nOPA is entitled to have reasonable access under PAIMI because the implementing regulations limit the term\n\"facility\" to residential facilities, which the Academy is not. They also claim that even if the Academy is a facility\nfor purposes of PAIMI, OPA cannot access it or speak with students without the consent of the students' parents\nor guardians. They further challenge the district court's holding that the P & A Acts authorize OPA, once it has\nprobable cause to believe that abuse or neglect has occurred at the facility, to obtain a general list of Academy\nstudents and the contact information for their parents or guardians. Defendants also maintain that the P & A Acts\nauthorize OPA to obtain contact information only for Academy students about whom they have received a specific\ncomplaint.\nInitially, defendants also asserted that FERPA and the IDEA prohibited them from allowing OPA to access the\nAcademy, its students or the students' contact information. Specifically, they argued that, regardless of any\nauthority OPA might have under the P & A Acts, FERPA and the IDEA prohibit them from allowing OPA to be\npresent at the Academy during school hours or to interview Academy students without the consent of their\n236 parents or guardians.[3] Similarly, without such permission, *236 defendants asserted, the release of the names\nof students and contact information for their parents or guardians is prohibited by FERPA. For the reasons we will\nexplain, defendants have since abandoned these arguments.\nFollowing oral argument, we invited the United States Departments of Education (\"DOE\") and Health and Human\nServices (\"HHS\") to file amicus briefs in this case providing their interpretations of the relevant statutory\nprovisions. DOE and HHS accepted our invitation and filed a joint brief with the Court, which, in significant part,\nrejects defendants' arguments. With respect to defendants' FERPA defense, the agencies explain that FERPA's\n\nnon-disclosure requirements are limited to tangible records and information derived from records and that FERPA\ndoes not prohibit an OPA representative from observing a classroom or speaking with students. They note that\nDOE has previously adopted this interpretation in informal guidance. Brief for Amici Curiae Department of\nEducation & Department of Health & Human Services (\"United States Br.\") at 12-13 & n. 5 (citing Dep't of Educ.,\nDec. 8, 2003 Letter to S. Mamas). DOE and HHS also explain that, to the extent FERPA prohibits defendants\nfrom releasing the names and contact information for students who OPA has probable cause to believe were\nsubject to abuse or neglect, the P & A Acts should be construed \"as a limited override of FERPA's non-disclosure\nrequirements\" in the circumstances presented by this case. United States Br. at 18.\nIn response to the agencies' submission, defendants notified this Court that, although they do not agree with the\nview articulated in the joint amicus brief, they will defer to the agencies' interpretation of FERPA. In light of the\nfact that they are already in compliance with the district court's injunction, defendants state that they consider this\nappeal to be moot and consent to its dismissal. Bird Letter, June 20, 2006, at 2. Defendants' letter, however,\nneither makes reference to the agencies' arguments based on the P & A Acts nor expresses similar deference to\nthe agencies' interpretation of those statutes.\nOPA responds that the case is not moot. It claims that it still needs the ability to access the Academy and monitor\nconditions at the school in the future. It also asserts that defendants' prosecution of the appeal, at least until their\nreceipt of the agencies' joint amicus brief, indicates that defendants do not want OPA to have access to the\nAcademy and that absent a ruling on defendants' arguments, they would be free to interpose their objections to\nOPA's investigations at the Academy based on FERPA in the future. Alisberg Letter, June 20, 2006, at 3-4.\nDISCUSSION\nThis Court reviews a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion, see Advance Pharm., Inc. v. United States,\n391 F.3d 377, 398 (2d Cir.2004), which occurs when a district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact or\nan error of law, see S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. v. Clorox Co., 241 F.3d 232, 237 (2d Cir.2001). Questions of\nstatutory construction and the appropriate level of deference to accord an agency's interpretation of a statute are\nquestions of law, which we review de novo. See Prot. & Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Mental Health &\nAddiction Servs., 448 F.3d 119, 123 (2d Cir.2006).\nI. Mootness\nThe first question we must address is whether defendants' deference to DOE's view of FERPA and their consent\nto dismiss the appeal moots the appeal. We address the latter question first.\n237 *237 Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b), parties may seek the voluntary dismissal of a docketed\nappeal in two ways. Parties may obtain a voluntary dismissal by signing and filing a \"dismissal agreement\nspecifying how costs are to be paid and pay[ing] any fees that are due.\" Fed. R.App. P. 42(b). Alternatively, an\nappeal may be dismissed on appellant's motion \"on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the court.\" Id. Here,\nthere is no signed dismissal agreement and defendants have not moved to dismiss the appeal. Their letter to the\nCourt consenting to dismissal is therefore insufficient to dismiss, and thus moot, the appeal. Cf. British Int'l Ins.\nCo. v. Seguros La Republica, S.A., 354 F.3d 120, 123 (2d Cir.2003) (finding that an appeal was not moot\nbecause the parties had failed to file a signed stipulation with the Clerk of the Court as required by Rule 42(b)).\nThat we do not view defendants' letter as a motion to dismiss their appeal, however, does not address the\nquestion of whether their deference to DOE's views now moots the appeal. \"The mootness doctrine provides that\n`an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.'\" Id. at\n122 (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 n. 10 (1974)). \"That the\ndispute between the parties was very much alive when suit was filed, or at the time [the court of appeals\nrendered judgment], cannot substitute for the actual case or controversy\" the Constitution requires in order for us\nto exercise our jurisdiction. Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 317, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). A case does\nnot become moot, however, if an appellant retains some interest in the case so that a favorable decision could\nredound to its favor. See Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 569-70, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 81\nL.Ed.2d 483 (1984); Stolt-Nielsen SA v. Celanese AG, 430 F.3d 567, 576 n. 6 (2d Cir.2005).\n\nHere, because defendants continue to press their arguments with respect to the P & A Acts, the parties remain\nadverse with respect to at least some of the issues on appeal. There is no question that if we were to render a\nfavorable decision for defendants, they would obtain relief because they would no longer have to comply with the\nterms of the injunction, which, as noted, requires defendants \"to grant both physical access and names and\ncontact information such that OPA can perform its statutory duty to investigate suspected abuse and neglect\" and\nthus has a continuing effect. See Tory v. Cochran, 544 U.S. 734, 737, 125 S.Ct. 2108, 161 L.Ed.2d 1042 (2005)\n(explaining that a case is not moot where it \"appears from [the] `terms' of the injunction that it is `still in force' and\n`unless set aside must be complied with'\" (quoting Firefighters Local Union No. 1784, 467 U.S. at 569, 104 S.Ct.\n2576)). Hence, defendants' deference to DOE's view of FERPA does not moot their appeal.\nAlthough defendants' agreement to defer to the views of DOE does not moot the appeal, it does serve to\nabandon certain arguments that defendants advanced initially on appeal 00 that FERPA should be read to bar\n97\nOPA from accessing the Academy and its students during school hours and from obtaining directory information\n[4]\nfor students. Accordingly, we do not address defendants' arguments with respect to FERPA (and the IDEA).\n238 See 24/7*238Records, Inc. v. Sony Music Entm't, Inc., 429 F.3d 39, 43 (2d Cir.2005) (declining to consider\narguments abandoned on appeal). We therefore turn to defendants' remaining claims on appeal.\nII. Access to the Academy\nDefendants contend that the district court erred in finding that the P & A Acts authorize OPA to access the\nAcademy and speak with its students for investigatory purposes. They argue that PAIMI authorizes OPA to have\nreasonable access only to residential facilities and that PAIR and the DD Act do not authorize the investigation of\nan entire school.\nA. PAIMI\nPAIMI authorizes P & A systems such as OPA to \"investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with\nmental illness if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents\noccurred.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(A). It further provides that a P & A system \"shall . . . have access to facilities\nin the State providing care or treatment.\" Id. § 10805(a)(3). Under PAIMI, the term \"facilities\" \"may include, but\nneed not be limited to, hospitals, nursing homes, community facilities for individuals with mental illness, board\nand care homes, homeless shelters, and jails and prisons.\" Id. § 10802(3).\nDefendants do not dispute that the Academy is a facility that provides care or treatment to individuals with mental\nillness 00 specifically, children who are seriously emotionally disturbed. Instead, defendants argue that, on the\n97\nbasis of the statute's plain language and its implementing regulations, the term \"facilities\" under PAIMI includes\nonly residential facilities. They point to the illustrative list of facilities at § 10802(3), which they claim consists\nsolely of residential facilities.\nDefendants assert further that we must defer to HHS's regulation defining a \"facility\" under PAIMI as \"any public\nor private residential setting that provides overnight care accompanied by treatment services.\" 42 C.F.R. § 51.2.\nDefendants contend that this definition is reasonable because, unlike residential facilities such as hospitals or\njails, day facilities like the Academy do not isolate students from their families or the community such that they\nwould require the services of a P & A system. Defendants further note that school children have a number of\nsources of protection and advocacy available to them, including the rights conferred on parents by the IDEA and\nthe requirement that teachers and most school district employees report suspected cases of abuse.\n239 OPA responds that this argument does not acknowledge that, after HHS promulgated *239 its regulatory\ninterpretation of the term \"facilities\" in 1997, Congress amended PAIMI in 2000 to extend its protection to\nindividuals with mental illness who live in the community. See Children's Health Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-310,\n§ 3206(b)(1)(B), 114 Stat. 1101, 1194 (2000). That is, prior to 2000, the definition of an \"individual with mental\nillness\" for purposes of the Act was limited to individuals who were inpatients or residents of a care or treatment\nfacility. See Pub.L. No. 99-319, Title I, § 102(3)(B), 100 Stat. 478, 479 (1986). In 2000, however, Congress\namended the definition of \"an individual with mental illness\" under the Act to include \"an individual00(A) who has a\n97\nsignificant mental illness or emotional impairment, as determined by a mental health professional qualified under\n\nthe laws and regulations of the State; and . . . (ii) . . . lives in a community setting, including [his or her] own\nhome.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10802(4).\nOPA contends that these amendments make clear that PAIMI's protections extend to individuals who attend day\nprograms like the one at the Academy. Because the Academy is a \"community facilit[y] for individuals with mental\nillness\" that \"provid[es] care or treatment,\" id. §§ 10802(3), 10805(a)(3), OPA argues, it is a facility to which OPA\nis empowered to have reasonable access under PAIMI.\nHHS, which is charged with issuing regulations interpreting and implementing PAIMI, see id. § 10826, also\nmaintains that the term \"facilities\" in the statute includes non-residential facilities that provide care and treatment\nof individuals with mental illness. The amicus brief HHS filed with DOE in this case states that it \"interprets the\ninvestigatory authority of a P & A pursuant to the PAIMI Act as extending to any facility providing care and\ntreatment to the mentally ill, regardless of whether the facility is residential.\" United States Br. at 10. It asserts\nthat this interpretation is most consistent with the text of PAIMI and the legislative purpose of the 2000\namendments, which were passed to \"strengthen community-based mental health services and enable children\nwith severe emotional disturbances to `remain in local communities rather than being sent to residential\nfacilities.'\" United States Br. at 9 (quoting S.Rep. No. 106-196, at 6 (1999)). In consequence, HHS rejects\ndefendants' argument that the definition of \"facility\" codified at 42 C.F.R. § 51.2 controls here.\nWhere, as here, an agency advances a statutory interpretation in an amicus brief that has not been articulated\nbefore in a rule or regulation, we do not apply the high level of deference due under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). See In re New\nTimes Sec. Servs., Inc., 371 F.3d 68, 80, 82 (2d Cir.2004) (concluding that an informal opinion in an amicus brief\nby the SEC does not have the force of law and therefore does not warrant Chevron deference). That does not\nmean, however, that we give no deference to the agency's view. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218,\n234-35, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). Rather, a reasonable agency determination, when advanced in\nan amicus brief that is not a \"post hoc rationalizatio[n],\" Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 462, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137\nL.Ed.2d 79 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), may be entitled to some deference on account of the\n\"specialized experience\" and information available to the agency. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 139, 65\nS.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944); see also Mead, 533 U.S. at 234-35, 121 S.Ct. 2164; In re New Times Sec.\n240 Servs., 371 F.3d at *240 82-83. Under Skidmore, the weight we give an agency's judgment is based on \"the\nthoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later\npronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" 323 U.S. at\n140, 65 S.Ct. 161.\nEvaluating the Skidmore factors here, we conclude that HHS's interpretation merits deference. The definition of\n\"facilities\" set forth in § 10802(3) does not distinguish between residential and day facilities. Although many of the\nexamples of facilities included in Congress's illustrative list are of a residential character, Congress also included\n\"community facilities for individuals with mental illness.\" The rubric \"community facilities\" does not appear, on its\nface, to be limited to residential programs. Moreover, reading the facility-access provision as limited to residential\nfacilities is contrary to Congress's clearly expressed intent to provide protection and advocacy services for\nindividuals with mental illness living in their own homes. See 42 U.S.C. § 10802(4). We therefore conclude that\nthe regulatory interpretation of \"facilities\" HHS promulgated in 1997 is no longer consistent with PAIMI after the\n2000 amendments. We defer instead to the reasonable interpretation advanced by HHS in this case 00 that the\n97\nterm \"facilities\" for purposes of PAIMI includes non-residential facilities that provide care or treatment to\nindividuals with mental illness.\nHere, the Academy is a school that provides a therapeutic educational program for students who are seriously\nemotionally disturbed. It is therefore a facility to which OPA must have reasonable access under PAIMI.\nB. PAIR and the DD Acts\nPAIR and the DD Act also grant access to certain facilities providing services to individuals with developmental\ndisabilities. The DD Act provides that a P & A system must \"have access at reasonable times to any individual\nwith a developmental disability in a location in which services, supports, and other assistance are provided to\nsuch an individual, in order to carry out the purpose of this part.\" 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(H). The Act provides\n\nfurther that the \"purpose of this part is to provide for allotments to support a protection and advocacy system . . .\nin each State to protect the legal and human rights of individuals with developmental disabilities in accordance\nwith this part.\" Id. § 15041. PAIR incorporates these provisions of the DD Act. See 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f) (providing\nthat a P & A system has the same authority under PAIR as under the DD Act for individuals who are disabled but\nneither have mental illness within the meaning of PAIMI nor developmental disabilities within the meaning of the\nDD Act).\nDefendants argue that § 15043(a)(2)(H) authorizes a P & A system to speak only with specific individuals in a\nservice location, and not to all individuals served by that location. That is, they contend that, because § 15043(a)\n(2)(H) provides OPA with access to \"any individual . . . in a location . . . in order to carry out the purpose of this\npart\" and that the purpose of this part is to \"`investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals,'\" Appellant's\nBr. at 14 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(B)), OPA has authority only to observe or speak with those students it\nhas reason to believe have been subject to abuse or neglect. In short, they maintain, the DD Act does not give\nOPA generalized access to the Academy facility and its students. We disagree.\nDefendants conflate § 15043(a)(2)(B) with § 15043(a)(2)(H). The former subsection provides P & A systems\n241 access to *241 facilities and permits them to speak with individuals in order to investigate specific incidents of\nsuspected abuse or neglect. The latter subsection provides more generalized access to any individual with a\ndisability in a location that provides services in order to carry out the statutory purpose of protecting the rights of\nsuch persons. Defendants' argument that a P & A system has the authority to access a service location under §\n15043(a)(2)(H) only for the purpose of investigating a specific incident 00 a right conferred by § 15043(a)(2)(B) 00\n97 97\nwould render § 15043(a)(2)(H) meaningless because it would authorize only those activities authorized by\nsubsection (B). We decline to read the statute in a way that would create a redundancy. See Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U.S. 362, 404, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (\"It is . . . a cardinal principle of statutory construction\nthat we must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\" (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\nIn addition, the DD Act's implementing regulations clearly provide that P & A systems have the authority to\ninterview all individuals at a particular facility:\nA system shall have reasonable unaccompanied access to public and private facilities which\nprovide services, supports, and other assistance for individuals with developmental disabilities in\nthe State when necessary to conduct a full investigation of an incident of abuse or neglect under\nsection 142(a)(2)(B) of the [DD] Act. This authority shall include the opportunity: to interview any\nfacility service recipient, employee, or other person, including the person thought to be the victim\nof such abuse, who might be reasonably believed by the system to have knowledge of the incident\nunder investigation; and to inspect, view and photograph all areas of the facility's premises that\nmight be believed by the system to have been connected with the incident under investigation.\n45 C.F.R. § 1386.22(f); see also id. § 1386.22(g) (noting that the system \"shall have unaccompanied access to all\nresidents of a facility at reasonable times, which at a minimum shall include normal working hours and visiting\n[5]\nhours\" for the purposes of fully investigating alleged abuse and neglect). See Alabama Disabilities Advocacy\nProgram v. J.S. Tarwater Developmental Ctr., 97 F.3d 492, 497 (11th Cir. 1996) (\"It is clear that [the DD] Act\n242 provides express authority for P & As to gain broad access to records, facilities, and residents *242 to ensure that\nthe Act's mandates can be effectively pursued.\"); Pennsylvania Prot. & Advocacy, Inc. v. Royer-Greaves Sch. for\nthe Blind, 1999 WL 179797, at *6 (E.D.Pa. Mar.25, 1999) (holding that \"reasonable access includes general\nfacility access without notice, and patient access with twenty-four hour notice\"); Mississippi Prot. & Advocacy\nSystem, Inc. v. Cotten, 1989 WL 224953, at *8-9 (S.D.Miss. Aug.4, 1989) (noting that P & A systems must have\n\"frequent personal contact\" with individuals receiving services, and that \"[c]entral to the concept of authority to\ninvestigate is the ability to interview witnesses\"), aff'd,929 F.2d 1054, 1059 (5th Cir.1991) (noting court's \"full\naccord\" with district court's conclusions regarding necessity of P & A access to individuals).\nMoreover, the \"purpose\" of this part of the DD Act is not as limited as defendants maintain, but rather aims to\nprotect the legal and human rights of individuals with developmental disabilities. Id. § 15041 (defining the\n\"purpose of this part\"). To this end, the statute provides access to service recipients for both investigatory and\n\nmonitoring purposes, i.e., to investigate past instances of suspected abuse or neglect and to monitor to ensure\ncurrent respect for the rights and safety of service recipients. Id. § 15043(a)(2)(B), (H). Simply put, the\nrequirement in § 15043(a)(2)(B) that a P & A system have the authority under the Act to investigate specific\nincidents does not limit a P & A system to that power alone.\nThe records-access provision of the DD Act also supports the view that a P & A system has the authority to have\nphysical access to a location and to observe and speak with service-recipients for monitoring purposes. It\nprovides that a P & A system may view the records of an individual with a disability when, inter alia, \"as a result of\nmonitoring or other activities, there is probable cause to believe that such individual has been subject to abuse or\nneglect.\" 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II) (emphasis added). This language indicates that Congress intended P &\nA systems not simply to respond to reports of maltreatment, but also to monitor facilities in order to prevent abuse\nor neglect.\nIn sum, to the extent that the Academy is a location that provides care or treatment to individuals with disabilities\nwithin the meaning of PAIR and the DD Act, OPA is authorized to have reasonable access to the Academy and its\nstudents during school hours both to investigate specific allegations and to monitor whether the school is\nrespecting students' rights and safety.\nC. Parental Permission\nDefendants next argue that even if PAIMI, PAIR and the DD Act generally authorize OPA to access a facility such\nas the Academy, OPA cannot do so here without permission from the students' parents or guardians. For this\nargument, they rely on the P & A Acts' records-access provisions, which require a P & A system, except in certain\nemergency situations, to obtain consent from the individual, if he or she is an adult and can consent, or the\nindividual's legal guardian prior to obtaining an individual's records. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 10805(a)(4) (PAIMI), 15043\n(a)(2)(I) (DD Act).\nThis argument need not detain us long. The DD Act and PAIMI distinguish between a P & A system's authority to\nspeak with an individual and its authority to obtain an individual's records. As discussed above, the DD Act\nprovides that a P & A system must have reasonable access to individuals. See 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(H).\n243 Similarly, PAIMI provides that OPA must have reasonable access to individuals in facilities that provide *243 care\nor treatment for individuals with mental illness. See 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(3). Nothing in the statutory language of\neither the DD Act or PAIMI conditions this access on the consent of an individual's parents or guardians.\nThat parental consent is not required is also supported by the regulations interpreting and implementing this\nsection. PAIMI's implementing regulations define \"reasonable access\" for monitoring purposes to include\nreasonable unaccompanied access to programs and individuals in order to ensure that their rights are being\nprotected, including the right to speak or otherwise communicate with individuals, including minors. 42 C.F.R. §\n51.42(c). As noted in the previous section, this regulation refers to \"residents,\" which reflects the statutory\ndefinition of an \"individual with mental illness\" at the time the regulation was promulgated. In the joint amicus\nbrief, HHS reads this provision to apply to Academy students, who plainly are not \"residents\" of the facility. United\nStates Br. at 12 (\"Under the statute and implementing regulations, a P & A's authority to access individuals or\nfacilities is not conditioned on parental notification or consent.\" (citing 42 C.F.R. § 51.42(d)-(e))). We read this\nregulation consistently with HHS's interpretation in the joint amicus brief. See generally In re New Times Sec.\nServs., Inc., 371 F.3d at 82-83; accord McCormick ex rel. McCormick v. Sch. Dist., 370 F.3d 275, 290 (2d\nCir.2004) (noting that courts generally defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of its regulation).\nContrary to the access provisions, PAIMI and the DD Act are very explicit about what type of authorization is\nrequired for a P & A system to view an individual's records: they detail from whom a P & A system must have\nauthority to access records and when prior consent is necessary. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 15043(a)(2)(I), 10805(a)(4).\nThat Congress provided explicit and detailed authorization provisions with respect to an individual's records but\ndid not do so with respect to a P & A system's right to access a facility suggests that it did not intend to require a\nP & A system to obtain authorization prior to visiting a facility to observe conditions or interact with the individuals\nreceiving services in that facility. See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17\n(1983) (\"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section\nof the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion\n\nor exclusion.\" (quotation marks and citation omitted; alteration in original)); see also Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry.\nCo. v. White, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2412, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (explaining that where Congress\nuses different words, it is presumed that Congress intended the different words to make a legal difference). We\ntherefore decline defendants' invitation to read a parental-consent provision into the statute where none exists.\nIII. Parent/Guardian Contact Information\nDefendants next argue that the district court erred in ordering it to release to OPA a directory of students\ncontaining contact information for their parents or guardians. The only arguments they press on appeal are that\nthe P & A Acts do not require the release of this information and that, even if they do, the district court erred in\nrequiring them to release the information for all students. We consider these arguments in turn.\nA. The P & A Acts Authorize the Disclosure of Contact Information\n244 Defendants assert that the district court erred in requiring them to give OPA *244 the names and contact\ninformation for Academy students because the P & A Acts do not expressly require them to disclose this\ninformation.\nThe DD Act, PAIR and PAIMI each permit OPA to access records in certain situations. Although there are some\ndifferences among the Acts, they require, broadly speaking, that a P & A system have access to an individual's\nrecords upon the consent of the individual or his or her guardian and in certain emergency situations. See 42\nU.S.C. §§ 10805(a)(4), 15043(a)(2)(I)-(J). They also permit a P & A system to have access to an individual's\nrecords if the individual's representative fails to act after a P & A system has received contact information for the\nrepresentative, contacted that person concerning possible abuse or neglect of the individual, and offered\nassistance in resolving the situation. Specifically, the DD Act provides that a P & A system must have access to\nan individual's records where there is probable cause to believe that the individual has been subject to abuse or\nneglect, the individual's representative \"has been contacted by such system, upon receipt of the name and\naddress of such representative; . . . such system has offered assistance to such representative to resolve the\nsituation; and . . . such representative has failed or refused to act on behalf of the individual.\" 42 U.S.C. § 15043\n(a)(2)(I)(iii)(III)-(V). PAIMI has a similar provision, but requires that a P & A system have probable cause to\nbelieve that the \"health or safety of the individual is in serious and immediate jeopardy.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4)\n(C). The implementing regulations for the DD Act and PAIMI further provide that if a P & A system is denied\naccess to an individual's records for, inter alia, alleged lack of authorization, it shall be provided with the name of\nthe guardian of that individual. 42 C.F.R. § 51.43; 45 C.F.R.. § 1386.22(i).\nOPA concedes that none of the P & A statutes explicitly requires that the Academy give it a list of students and\ncontact information for their parents or guardians. Nonetheless, it contends that because a P & A system cannot\nobtain consent to access a student's records from the student's guardian without the guardian's name or contact\ninformation, but it can obtain the guardian's name if it is denied access to an individual's records for lack of\nauthorization pursuant to the governing regulations, it is therefore entitled to a list of students and contact\ninformation for their parents or guardians. OPA further asserts that the Academy's failure to disclose this\ninformation impedes its statutory duty under the P & A Acts and is contrary to the clear spirit, if not the exact\nletter, of the laws.\nIn the joint amicus brief filed in this case, HHS and DOE take the position that the records-access provisions of\nthe P & A Acts \"expressly contemplate that a school or other facility will provide contact information to a P & A in\norder to allow the P & A to carry out its responsibility to investigate abuse or neglect.\" United States Br. at 14. The\nagencies assert that, to the extent that OPA has made the requisite probable cause determinations, OPA has a\nclear right to contact information for those students' parents or guardians. Id. at 14-15.\nWe find persuasive the agencies' view that Congress intended a P & A system to be able to obtain the names\nand contact information for the parents or guardians of students at the Academy. By conditioning access on the\nconsent of an individual or, if the individual cannot consent, his or her legal guardian or representative, the Acts\nrequire that P & A systems contact the guardians of individuals with disabilities or mental illness if they have the\n245 requisite prior cause to believe that abuse or neglect *245 is occurring at the facility. This interpretation is\nconsistent with Congress's view that \"family members of individuals with mental illness play a crucial role in being\n\nadvocates for the rights of individuals with mental illness where the individuals are minors.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10801(a)\n(2). Hence, we conclude that OPA is authorized under PAIMI, the DD Act and PAIR to obtain the names of\n[6]\nAcademy students and contact information for their parents or guardians.\nB. Scope of the Injunction\nSimilar to its argument with respect to whether OPA can speak with students, defendants maintain that the district\ncourt erred in requiring that they disclose the names and contact information for all Academy students.\nDefendants assert that the P & A Acts require the release of the names and contact information only for those\nparticular individuals whom OPA has reason to believe have been victims of an incident of abuse or neglect, not\nfor an \"entire school of individuals.\" In short, they contend that the injunction is overly broad in scope.\nDistrict courts have broad authority in crafting equitable remedies such as injunctions. Bano v. Union Carbide\nCorp., 361 F.3d 696, 716 (2d Cir.2004) (citing Lemon v. Kurtzman, 411 U.S. 192, 200, 93 S.Ct. 1463, 36 L.Ed.2d\n151 (1973)). Accordingly, \"appellate review is correspondingly narrow.\" Lemon, 411 U.S. at 200, 93 S.Ct. 1463.\nThe question, therefore, is whether the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in ordering defendants to\ndisclose the names and contact information of all Academy students.\nHere, the district court concluded that OPA had probable cause to obtain the disclosure of this information. See\nOPA,355 F.Supp.2d at 661. Defendants do not advance any arguments that this determination was in error, and\nwe see none. Although OPA presumably did not receive a specific complaint about each student, it submitted\nevidence that it had complaints about the operation of particular policies that led to inappropriate restraint and\nseclusion and that those policies operated school-wide. Given that these allegations are system-wide, OPA could\nhave reason to believe that all students at the school had been, were being, or were at risk of being neglected or\nabused.\n246 Further, although the P & A Acts speak in terms of the \"individual\" or \"an individual,\" *246 nothing in the statute\nsuggests that OPA cannot seek authorization for a number of individuals if it has made a probable cause\ndetermination that multiple individuals have been subjected to abuse or neglect at a facility. As HHS has noted,\n\"neither the Act nor case law imposes an individual-specific probable cause requirement,\" and a probable cause\ndetermination could be made on the basis of \"general conditions or problems that affect many or all individuals in\na facility.\" Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; Requirements Applicable to Protection\nand Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness; Final Rule, 62 Fed.Reg. 53,548, 53,559 (Oct. 15, 1997); see also\nPa. Prot. & Advocacy, Inc. v. Royer-Greaves Sch. for Blind, 1999 WL 179797, at *9-10 (E.D.Pa. Mar.25, 1999)\n(finding that a P & A system was authorized to obtain a list of the names and addresses of the guardians of the\nstudents at a residential school for children with developmental disabilities and blindness where the P & A system\nhad received complaints of \"systemic neglect\" at the school); see also Iowa Prot. & Advocacy Servs., Inc. v.\nGerard Treatment Programs, L.L.C., 152 F.Supp.2d 1150, 1171-72 (N.D.Ia.2001) (suggesting that probable\ncause to believe that widespread abuse is occurring justifies generalized access to records).\nFinally, defendants' assertion that the district court erred in ordering the disclosure of the names of all Academy\nstudents and the contact information for their parents and guardians rings hollow in light of their simultaneous\nargument that OPA must have parental consent prior to undertaking any investigative or monitoring activities at\nthe school. Given that the vast majority of Academy students are minors whose parents or guardians have a\nstrong interest in the protection of their rights and well-being, see 42 U.S.C. § 10801(a)(2), we cannot say that\nthe district court abused its discretion in requiring defendants to provide the names and contact information for all\nAcademy students.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n[*] The Honorable Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New\nYork, sitting by designation.\n\n[1] Enacted in 1986 as the \"Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986,\" Pub.L. No. 99-319,\n100 Stat. 478 (May 23, 1986), the Act was commonly referred to by the acronym \"PAMII.\" See, e.g., Ctr. for Legal\nAdvocacy v. Hammons, 323 F.3d 1262, 1263 (10th Cir.2003). In 1991, amendments to the Act substituted\n\"individuals with mental illness\" for \"mentally ill individuals\" wherever it appeared in the Act. See Pub.L. No.\n102-173, § 10(2), 105 Stat. 1217, 1219 (Nov. 27, 1991). The short title, however, remained unchanged. In 2000,\nCongress amended the short title so that the Act is now known as the \"Protection and Advocacy for Individuals\nwith Mental Illness Act\" or \"PAIMI.\" See Pub.L. No. 106-310, 114 Stat. 1101, 1193-94 (Oct. 17, 2000).\n[2] Under regulations promulgated pursuant to PAIMI and the DD Act, the use of excessive force when placing an\nindividual in physical restraints is considered to be abuse. See 42 C.F.R. § 51.2 (PAIMI); 45 C.F.R. § 1386.19 (the\nDD Act).\n[3] The IDEA requires schools that receive federal funds for special education, such as the Academy, to abide by\nthe terms of FERPA. See 20 U.S.C. § 1417(c). It does not impose any further non-disclosure requirements. We\ntherefore discuss defendants' non-disclosure argument only with reference to FERPA.\n[4] OPA's apparent concern that defendants' abandonment of their FERPA claims on appeal will allow defendants\nto challenge the injunction or similar requests for access and information by OPA on this ground in the future\nseems misplaced. As an initial matter, we note that defendants' deference to DOE and their abandonment of their\nFERPA arguments on appeal mean that they do not challenge so much of the district court ruling as rejected\nthose claims. \nMoreover, although a determination of whether defendants are precluded from raising FERPA to refute any of\nOPA's future requests to investigate allegations of abuse or neglect must abide that event, we note that\ndefendants' abandonment of their FERPA arguments on appeal does not alter the fact that the FERPA arguments\nhave been litigated in this case, were decided by the district court, were necessary to the judgment on the merits,\nand were not challenged on appeal. See Uzdavines v. Weeks Marine, Inc., 418 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir.2005)\n(\"[I]ssue preclusion[] applies where: (1) the identical issue was raised in a previous proceeding; (2) the issue was\nactually litigated and decided in the previous proceeding; (3) the party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the\nissue; and (4) the resolution of the issue was necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits.\"\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n[5] Like PAIMI, the DD Act was amended by Congress after this regulation was promulgated to extend its\nprotections to individuals not living in residential facilities. See Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of\nRights Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-402, § 143(a)(2)(H), 114 Stat. 1677, 1715 (2000). The prior version of the DD\nAct, pursuant to which HHS promulgated its regulation, limited a P & A system's access to residents of a facility\nfor persons with disabilities. See 42 U.S.C. § 6042(a)(2)(H) (1994) (repealed) (providing that P & A systems shall\n\"have access at reasonable times and locations to any resident who is an individual with a developmental\ndisability in a facility that is providing services, supports, and other assistance to such resident\"). To the extent\nthat HHS's regulation interprets the statute's former language to limit P & A systems' access only to individuals\nwith developmental disabilities in residential locations, the regulation has been superseded by congressional\nenactment and is not controlling. \nIn the joint amicus brief, HHS implicitly reads the regulation promulgated at 45 C.F.R. § 1386.22(g) to provide\naccess to any individual with a developmental disability in a location that provides services, regardless of whether\nthe individual is a resident of the location. Although we are not called upon to defer to this interpretation, we note\nthat it is consistent with the plain language of the DD Act, as amended, which authorizes OPA to have physical\naccess to all individuals in the location for monitoring purposes.\n[6] In the district court, defendants also asserted that the access provisions discussed in the text do not apply\nbecause Academy parents are not the legal guardians, conservators or legal representatives of the Academy\nstudents. See 42 C.F.R. 51.2 (defining these terms under PAIMI to include only those persons whose\nappointment is made and regularly reviewed by the State); 45 C.F.R. § 1386.19 (same under the DD Act). But\nsee 62 Fed. Reg. 53,548, 53,552 (Oct. 15, 1997) (explaining in the comments to the final rule that, with respect to\nminor children, the \"natural or adoptive parents are legal guardians unless the State has appointed another legal\n\nguardian under applicable State law\"). \"[C]rediting the agency's interpretation of its own regulation,\" and noting\nthat the P & A Acts expressly contemplated a role for family members, the district court held that it could not\nconclude that \"parents are excluded from the definition of a `Legal Guardian, Conservator, and Legal\nRepresentative.'\" OPA,355 F.Supp.2d at 662. \nOn appeal, defendants initially asserted that the district court erred in this holding because it conflicts with\nFERPA's prohibition on the disclosure of parental identities without giving notice to parents and an opportunity for\nthem to request that their identities not be disclosed. Because defendants abandoned their FERPA arguments\nafter oral argument in this case, and advance no other argument with respect to the district court's reasoning, we\nalso deem this argument abandoned and do not address it further.

That directory infonnation would enable the OPA   to seek releases from those \nparents and guardians for the students' educational and other records.  OPA additionally \nchallenges Defendants' refusal to aJIow OPA   access to the HTLA facilities at times when the \n2 \nstudents are in attendance. This access authority is specifically granted to OPA pursuant to \nfederal law. \nThese refusals by Defendants prevent OPA  , the state and federally designated Protection \nand Advocacy System for persons with disabilities in Connecticut, from fulfilling its statutory \nmandates of investigating allegations of abuse and neglect as well as providing protection and \nadvocacy services for individuals with disabilities.  The actions ofthe Defendants further prevent \nOPA from detennining whether the rights of students to be free from abuse and iIJegal restraint \nare being violated and whether there are appropriate procedures in place to prevent continued \nincidents of abuse and neglect. \nCongress drafted the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and BiJI of Rights Act (\"DD \nAct\"), 42 U.S.C. §ISOOI, et. seq., because oftne concern it had over instances of abuse of \ndevelopmentally disabled persons such as those contained in the allegations in the instant matter. \nThe DD Act established the Protection and Advocacy System (\"P&A\") to investigate and \nremedy abuse and neglect of persons with developmental disabilities, and to provide them with \nlegal representation and advocacy services.  The P&A system is a nationwide network of \ndisability rights agencies that are mandated and designated for every state and territory ofthe \nUnited States.  42 U.S.C. § IS043(a)(2)(A)(i).  To accomplish this goal, Congress granted broad \ninvestigative access authority to the P&As.  In order to protect the rights of individuals with \ndisabilities to be free from abuse and neglect, OPA, as the P&A for the State of Connecticut, has \nThis directory information consists of name, address and telephone numbers of the parents or guardians of students \n1 \nwho attend HTLA. \n2 \n\nthe authority to obtain the directory information that is being requested and to visit the HTLA \nfacilities at times when the students are in attmdance.  42 U.S.C. § 15043 (a)(2)(I)(i)-(iii), 42 \nU.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(H), 45 C.F.R. § 1386.2?(f) and (g). \nSimilarly, the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 \n42 U.s.C.  §§ 10801-10827 (PAIMI) was enacted in 1986 by Congress to establish independent \nprotection and advocacy systems (P&As) nationwide with authority to protect individuals with \nmental illness from abuse and neglect. 42.U.S.C. § 10801(b)(2)(A), (B). Congress established \nP&As in response to the myriad accounts of abuse and neglect against individuals with mental \nillness that were substantiated by congressional investigations.  Congress found that \"individuals \nwith mental illness are vulnerable to abuse and serious injury\" as well as \"neglect, including lack \nof treatment, adequate nutrition, clothing, health care, and adequate discharge planning.\" 42 \nU.S.C. § 10801(a)(I), (3). Moreover, Congresil found that \"[sJtate systems for monitoring \ncompliance with respect to the rights of individuals with mental illness vary widely and are \nfrequently inadequate.\" 42 U.S.C. § (a)10801(4).  Accordingly, Congress granted P&As the \npower to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of persons with mental illness if the incidents \nare reported to P&As or P&As have probable cause to believe that incidents have occurred. 42 \nU.S.C. § 10805(1 )(A).  Similar to the DD Act, PAlMI provides a P&A with the authority to \nseek records and have access to facilities at times service recipients (students) are present.  42 \nU.S.C. § 10806,42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(3), 42 C.F.R. § 51.42. Additionally, the Protection and \nAdvocacy of Individual Rights (hereinafter \"PAIR\") 29 U.S.C. § 794e, et seq., provides access to \nrecords and facilities in the same manner as the DD Act and PAlMI for individuals with other \ndisabilities not specifically provided for by PAlMI and the DD Act. \nHTLA maintains 2 facilities at two separate locations. \n2 \n3 \n\nThe authority of OP A to conduct investigations and to have access to records was \nrecently upheld by the District of Connecticut in Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons \nwith Disabilities v. Annstrong, 266 F. Supp.2d 303 (D. Conn. 2003) (hereinafter Annstrong.).  In \nAnnstrong, the Court discussed the history of the DD Act and PAlMI and ruled that \"P AMII \n[sic] specifically charges the State's P&A, which is an independent agency, with the duty to \n'investigate incidents of abuse and neglect oLllldividuals with mental illness if the incidents are \nreported to the system or ifthere is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred. '\"  Id. at \n310. \nIf the Defendants do not release the directory information to OP A or provide OP A with \naccess to HTLA when the students are present, OPA will suffer irreparable harm because it will \nnot be able to fulfill its statutory obligation to investigate abuse and neglect, as well as to provide \nprotection and advocacy services to students who have been, and may still be, at risk of abuse. \nThere will be no harm to Defendants because the release of records to a P&A does not violate the \nconfidentiality provisions of the Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act (\"FERP A\"), 20 \nU.S.C. § 1232g, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 \net. seq. The public interest will not be harmed, but rather furthered by OPA having access to the \ndirectory information and the facility to prevent continued harm to students at HTLA.  This \nCourt should issue a preliminary and thereafter permanent injunction in this matter because \nPlaintiffs have the statutory authority to fully access the directory information.  Finally, OPA \nwill be irreparably harmed if it is prevented from pursuing its right to access the directory \ninformation and to access the facility in pursuit of its statutory duty to investigate suspected \nincidents of abuse and neglect. \n4 \n\nII.  Statement of Facts \nHartford Transitional Learning Academy (hereinafter \"HTLA\") is a school that, despite \nits label of \"transitional,\" functions as a placement oflast resort in the Hartford Public School \nsystem.  HTLA primarily accepts children who have a label of \"emotionally disturbed\" and who \nhave not experienced success at placements at other schools within the system, notably their \nlocal schools.  Upon information and belief, students who are placed at HTLA have disabilities \nthat include mental illness, developmental disabilities, brain injuries and other disabilities \nincluding cognitive disabilities.3  Children also have a documented history of challenging \nnegative behavior.  In order to be placed at HTLA a student and hislher parents or guardians \nneed to sign an agreement that permits the  of \"time-out procedures and/or restraints.\" \nus(~ \nStudents and their parents or guardians must also sign a form permitting the use of \"reasonable \nforce when [an HTLA staff person] believes it is necessary to (a) protect himselflherself or \nothers from immediate physical injury; (b) obtain possession of a dangerous instrument or \ncontrolled substance upon or within the control of such student or (c) protect property from \nphysical damage.\" (Emphasis added.)  Attaehed hereto as Attachment 1.  Hartford Public \nSchools \"Usage of Therapeutic Physical Restraint to Maintain Safety.\" \nAs part of its regular intake process, OPA has received complaints from parents of \nstudents at HTLA.  These complaints have included allegations that the students have been \nsubjected to inappropriate restraint and seclm:ion.  Some of these allegations have included \nclaims that the students were injured during the restraint process. Aff. of Centeno at -,r 4-10. \nAttached hereto as Attachment 2. The students had a variety of disabilities including mental \nillness, developmental disabilities, and other r;ognitive impairments. \n3 Children with brain injuries are served under the DD Act.  Tennessee Protection & Advocacy, Inc. v. Wells, 371 \nF.3d 342 (6th Cir. 2004). \n5 \n\n--\n~~-~~~--\ninvestigators would \"make every effort not to disrupt the educational environment.\" See Letter \nfrom OPA to Robert Henry, February 10, 2004.  Attached hereto as Attachment 5. \nOn Tuesday, February 10, 2004 investigators from OPA and OCA arrived at HTLA. \nFaith VosWinkel from OCA and Bruce Garri~:on from OPA went into the school office at \napproximately 8:30 am, signed in and informe:d the clerk where they were from and that they \nwished to see Barbara Macauley, the principal ofHTLA.  The clerk asked them to wait. Aff. of \nGarrison at ~ 8-10 and Aff. of Vos Winkel at ~ 8-10 attached hereto as Attachment 6. \nWhen Macauley arrived at the office approximately 25 minutes later, she asked Mr. \nGarrison and Ms. VosWinkel to come into her office where Ms. VosWinkel told her that they \nwere there to initiate an investigation into HTLA.  Aff. of Garrison at ~ 12 and Aff. of \nVosWinkel at ~ 12.  When Macauley expressed surprise and said she knew nothing about an \ninvestigation Ms. VosWinkel informed her that a letter had been sent to Defendant Henry.  Aff. \n'113. \nof Garrison at ~ 13 and Aff. ofVosWinkel at  Macauley informed Mr. Garrison and Ms. \nVosWinkel that she had not received a letter and asked what kind of investigation they intended \nto conduct.  Ms. Vos Winkel told her that during this particular visit they intended only to look at \ndocuments relating to policies, procedures and program descriptions ofHTLA.  She also stated \nthat they planned additional visits to observe the programs at HTLA and to talk to faculty.  She \ntold Ms. McCauley that they would not be going into confidential student areas on that day.  Aff. \nof Garrison at ~ 14 and Aff. of Vos Winkel a~ 14. \nMacauley stated that before she could let Mr. Garrison and Ms. VosWinkel into the \nfacility she needed to check with her administration.  After leaving her office for approximately \n10 minutes she returned and told them that she had spoken with Assistant Corporation Counsel \n7 \n\nAnn Bird who advised her not to let them into the facility or to review any documents.  She then \nasked them to leave, which they did.  Aff. of Garrison at 'll16 and Aff. ofVosWinkel at'll 16. \nOn or about April 7, 2004 staff from OPA   and OCA met with Defendant Henry and \nMacauley and other officials from Defendant HPS and with counsel for the Defendants to try to \nresolve the question of access to the facility for the purpose of conducting the investigation. \nOPA explained the areas of concern it had and explained its authority for conducting the \ninvestigation.  OPA   asked for directory infornlation so that it could contact parents and guardians \nto seek consents for release of educational records and renewed its request for access to the \nfacility.  At the conclusion ofthe meeting, OPA agreed that it would provide a letter to \nDefendants explaining its authority.  On April 12, 2004 OPA wrote to counsel for Defendants \nand discussed the various statutes which provided this authority, and cited to case law.  OPA \nrenewed its request for both directory information and access to the facility.  See Letter from \nOPA   to Ann Bird.  Attached hereto as Attachment 7. \nOn May 3,2004 counsel for Defendants responded to OPA's letter and, citing the very \nprivacy concerns refuted in OPA's letter, refused to allow OPA access to either the directory \ninformation or the facility.  See Letter dated May 3, 2004 from Ann Bird to OPA.  Attached \nhereto as Attachment 8.  On July 20, 2004 counsel for OPA wrote to counsel for Defendants \nattempting to resolve the matter and informing Defendants that should the matter not be resolved \nthe case would have to be litigated.  Attached hereto as Attachment 9.  Counsel for Defendants \nresponded on July 22, 2004.  In that letter Defmdants continued to refuse to allow Plaintiffs \naccess to the directory information.  Defendants did state that they would allow Plaintiffs access \nto the HTLA facility, but only when the students were not present.  Plaintiffs replied to this letter \n8 \n\non July 27,2004 and infonned Defendants that this offer was not acceptable.  Attached hereto as \nAttaclnnents 10 and II. \nIII.  Argument \nOPA HAS MET THE REOUIREMJ8:NTS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND \nIS ENTITLED TO A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nInjunctive relief is available when there is no adequate remedy at law and the balance of \nequities favors the moving party.  See II Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 2944 at 394 (1973 and 1992 Supp.); accord N.Y. State National \nOrganization for Women v. Terry. 704 F. Supp. 1247, 1262 (S.D.N.Y. 1989), affd on other \ngrounds 886 F.2d 1339 (2d Cir. 1989). A plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief in this \nCircuit must demonstrate: \"(1) irreparable hann and (2) either (a) likelihood of success on the \nmerits or (b) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits and a balance of hardships tipping \ndecidedly toward the party seeking the injunctive relief.\"  Malkentzos v. DeBuono. 102 FJd 50, \n54 (2d Cir. 1996), Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73, 77 (2d Cir. 1992), citing Resolution Trust \nCom. v. Elman, 949 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1991).  See also OPA v. Annstrong, 266 F. Supp.2d \nat 311. \nOrdinarily, the purpose of the injunction is to maintain the status quo pending a trial on \nthe merits. Abdul WaH v. Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1025 (2d Cir. 1985). However, occasionally \ninjunctive relief may change the status quo of1he parties. Id.  This type of injunction is \nmandatory, rather than prohibitory.  As a result, this Circuit has required the movant to meet a \nhigher standard, a substantial or clear showing of likelihood of success on the merits. \nFurthennore, a mandatory injunction may also be issued upon a showing that \"extreme or very \nserious damage will result\" from a denial of injunctive relief. Id.  This heightened standard is \nalso required, whether the injunction is manda10ry or prohibitory, where injunctive relief will \n9 \n\nprovide the movant with substantially all the relief sought and that relief cannot be undone even \nif the defendant prevails at trial on the merits. Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Int'l, 60 F.3d \n27,34 (2d Cir. 1995), Forest City Daly Housing, Inc. v.  Town of North Hempstead, 175 F.3d \n144, 149 (2d Cir. 1999). \nSuch is this case. OPA   must show a substantial or clear likelihood of success on the \nmerits.  If OPA is granted injunctive relief, Ddendants will be required to release directory \ninformation to allow OPA   to seek consents for release of information from parents and guardians \nof students at HTLA, Defendants will be reqwired to provide OPA access to the HTLA facilities \nwhen the students are present, and Defendants will be required to permit OPA to conduct its \ninvestigation. This relief will provide OPA with substantially all the relief sought and that relief \ncannot be undone even if Defendants prevail at trial on the merits. \nIn the present case, no adequate remedy at law exists for OP A.  OPA   requested access to \nthe directory information and the facility and was denied such access.  It is clear that Plaintiffs \ncannot be made whole through money damages and will continue to suffer irreparable harm \nwithout injunctive relief.  In view ofthe federal protection and advocacy mandates, OPA has a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim.  Indeed, in Armstrong the Court held \nthat \n[i]n this case, there can be no dispute that Connecticut P&A has no other adequate \nremedy at law, and that it will be irreparably harmed if it is 'prevented from pursuing \nfully its right to access records .. .in pursuit of its duty to investigate circumstances \nproviding probable cause to believe abuse or neglect may be occurring.' \nArmstrong, 266 F. Supp. 2d at 311. \nArmstrong is not an anomaly.  Most co~rts that have considered whether to grant an \ninjunction in the DD Act and PAlMI context have held that the injunction should be granted. \nSee Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program v. Tarwarter Developmental Ctr., aft\"' d, 97 F.3d \n10 \n\n492 (11 th Cir. 1996),894 F. Supp. 424 (M.D. Ala. 1995)(permanent injunction); Mississippi Prot. \n& Advocacy Sys. Inc. v. Cotton, 929 F.2d 1054 (5th Cir. 1991)(mandatory injunction); Iowa Prot. \n& Advocacy Serv., Inc. v. Gerard Treatment Programs L.L.C., 152 F. Supp.2d 1150 (N.D. Iowa \nJune 25, 2001), modified July 27,2001 (preliminary injunction); Wisconsin Coalition For \nAdvocacy v. Czaplewski, 131 F. Supp.2d 1039 (E.D. Wisc. 2001)(preliminary injunction); \nWashington Prot. & Advocacy Syst.. Inc. v. State of Washington, No. C98-5401 RJB (W.D, \nWash. July 26, 1999); Advocacy Ctr. v. Stald(lr, 128 F. Supp. 358 (M.D. La. 1999)(permanent \ninjunction); Oklahoma Disability LawCtr., Inc. v. Dillon Family & Youth Servs., Inc., 879 F. \nSupp. 1110 (N.D. Okla. 1995)(permanent injunction); Robbins v. Budke, 739 F. Supp. 1479 \n(D.N.M. I 990)(permanent injunction).  This Court should likewise grant Plaintiffs injunctive \nrelief, preliminary and permanent thereafter. \n1.  Irreparable Harm \n\"Irreparable injury is the sine qua non for the grant ofa preliminary injunctive relief.\" \nUnited States Postal Servo v. Brennan, 579 F.2d 188, 191 (2d Cir. 1978) (citations omitted). A \nshowing of irreparable harm is considered perhaps the single most important requirement in \nsatisfying the standard. Pinckney V. Bd. ofEduc. of the Westburv Union Free School Dist., 920 \nF. Supp. 393, 399 (E.D.N.Y. 1996).  Ordinarily, \"irreparable harm means injury for which a \nmonetary award cannot be adequate compensation.\" Loveridge v. Pendelton Woolen Mills, Inc., \n788 F.2d 914,917 (2d Cir. 1986), quoting Jackson Dairy, Inc., V. H.P. Hood & Sons, Inc., 596 \nF.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir. 1979). However, a showing of irreparable injury may be presumed in certain \ninstances of civil rights violations. Therefore, \"a traditional showing of irreparable harm is not \nrequired when a plaintiff seeks equitable relief to prevent the violation of a federal statute .... \" \n11 \n\nMcKinney v. Town Plan and Zoning Comm'll, 790 F. Supp.l197, 1207, (D. Conn. 1992).  See \nalso Connecticut Hosp. v. City of New London, 129 F. Supp.2d. 123, 128 (D. Conn. 2001). \nTo illustrate, one such context where irreparable harm may be presumed is where there is a \nshowing of a violation ofthe Fair Housing Act. McKinney, 790 F. Supp. at 1207,  Connecticut \nHosp.,129 F. Supp.2d. at 128. Although the Second Circuit has yet to rule conclusively on this \nissue, other circuits have. Gresham v. Windrush Partners, Ltd., 730 F.2d 1417, 1423 (II  Cir. \nth \nI 984)(National Housing Act); Baxter v. City of Belleville, III., 720 F. Supp. 720, 734 (S.D. Ill. \nI 989)(Fair Housing Act); Bronson v. Crestwood Lake Section I Holding Corp., 724 F. Supp. \n148, 153 (S.D.N.Y. I 989)(Fair Housing Act). \nIrreparable harm may similarly be presumed in the present case as in McKinney and \nConnecticut Hospital.  OPA seeks injunctive reliefto prevent violations of the DD Act, PAlMI, \nand PAIR, all federal civil rights statutes.  OPA, like the plaintiffs in McKinney and Connecticut \nHospital, presents facts sufficient to establish that its authority under these statutes has been \nviolated. Both the courts in McKinney and Cgnnecticut Hospital found that irreparable injury \ncould be presumed because the plaintiffs' rights had been violated under the Fair Housing Act. \nMcKinney, 790 F. Supp. at 1207, Connecticut Hosp.l29 F. Supp.2d at 128.  The conclusions \nreached in those cases should apply with equal force to the application ofthe federal P&A \nstatutes.  OP A has the statutory authority to the access it seeks.  Since Defendants have not \nprovided such access, OPA's rights have been violated under its federal statutes. Thus, this Court \nshould find that OPA is per se irreparably injured.  Armstrong, 266 F. Supp.2d at 311. \nAs the Court concluded in Armstrong, OP A continues to suffer irreparable harm. Id. The \nharm that OP A will suffer should this Court deny injunctive relief is quite serious.  OP A will \nlose its ability to fulfill its statutory duty to invc:stigate suspected incidents of abuse and neglect \n12 \n\nin pursuit of its federal mandate to protect and advocate for persons with disabilities.  As stated \nat page 2 supra, Congress drafted the DD Act because of the concern it had over instances of \nabuse of developmentally disabled persons sw:h as those contained in the allegations in the \ninstant matter.  To respond to this concern, Congress granted broad investigative access rights to \nthe P&As. \nSimilarly, in 1985, Congress concluded that the rights of individuals with mental illness \nwere not being protected and PAlMI, 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-10827, was enacted. Under PAlMI, \nstate systems have the authority to independently investigate either upon a report or when it has \nprobable cause to believe such an act of abuse or neglect has occurred.  42 U.S.C. § 10801 and \n42 C.F.R. § 51.41.  Thus, under PAlMI, the DD ACT and PAIR P&A's also have authority to \npursue administrative, legal, and other appropliate remedies to insure protection of individuals \nwith mental illness. 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(I), lmd 42 C.F.R. § 51.31,42 U.S.C. § \n15043(a)(2)(A)(i).4  Therefore, ifOPA is not permitted to conduct its investigation and have \naccess to the HTLA facilities at times students are present and to the directory information, OPA   \nwill be irreparably harmed in its ability to fulfill its statutory mandates. \nPrior to Armstrong, the Eastern District of Wisconsin recognized the serious harm to a \nP&A's statutory duty to investigate suspected incidents of abuse and neglect if it were deprived \nof its statutory right to access requested record:; in pursuit of its mandate to investigate.  In \nWisconsin Coalition For Advocacy v. Czaplewski, the plaintiff successfully argued that the \ndefendant's refusal to provide records which the plaintiff was entitled frustrated its ability to \ncarry out its mandate to investigate abuse and neglect. Czaplewski, 131 F. Supp.2d 1039, 1050 \n(E.D. Wisc. 2001). The court in Czapleswki cited to a variety of specific harms to its ability to \n4 PAIR is based upon the DD Act, this argument is also televant with respect to PAIR.  29 U.S.C. § 794e(I)(2). \n13 \n\nconduct a timely investigation. Most relevant to the instant case the court held that \"[p] erhaps \nmost importantly, the residents on whose behalf it must act bear the risk of injury or death.\" Id. \nat 1051. The court was persuaded that the defl~ndant's refusal to provide the plaintiffwith \nrecords that it was entitled to review as part of its responsibilities \"in a very real and readily \nidentifiable way, posers] a threat to the plaintiffs being able to discharge its obligations.  And no \namount of damages will remedy that sustained harm.\" Id. In the instant case, OPA is, at this time, \nasking only for directory information and facility access, thus making the argument in favor of \ndisclosure even more compelling. \nDefendants have prevented OP A from performing its federal mandates and from taking \nsteps to protect these young people from abuse and neglect.  OPA has the authority and the \nobligation to investigate the allegations regarding HTLA. Interference with OPA's efforts to \ncarry out its federal mandate harms OPA and the individuals it is .empowered to protect. If a \nP&A is denied records for a claim it is investigating, it suffers direct injury to its statutory \ninterest.  Armstrong, 266 F. Supp.2d at 311,  Stalder, 128 F. Supp. 2d at 362. \n2.  Substantial Likelihood of Success on thE' Merits \nThe second step of the inquiry for injunctive relief requires that the plaintiff demonstrate \na substantial or clear showing oflikelihood of success on the merits, where: (a) an injunction will \nalter, rather than maintain, the status quo, or (b) an injunction will provide the movant with \nsubstantially all the relief sought and that relief cannot be undone even if the defendant prevails \nat the trial on the merits. See Saban Int'l, 60 FJd at 34 and Abdul Wali, 754 F.2d at 1025. Here, \nOP A has met the requirement of showing a substantial likelihood that it will prevail on the \nmerits. \n14 \n\nOPA   is a federally funded protection lmd advocacy system mandated to provide \nprotection and advocacy services for persons with disabilities.  See supra at 2-3. In pursuit of \nOP A's federal authority to investigate suspected incidents of abuse and neglect, P AIMI and the \nDD Act mandate that OPA be given access to records when incidents of abuse or neglect are \nreported, or when the P&A makes a probable cause determination that abuse or neglect may have \noccurred. 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4)(A), (B), 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)«I)(I), 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(2). \nIn this case the only records OPA is seeking in the directory information so OPA may contact \nparents and guardians to seek consent for the release of records.  Defendants have violated the \nDD Act, P AIMI and PAIR by refusing to provide OPA with this information. \nIn addition, both PAIMI and the DD Act provide that P&A's shall have access to \nfacilities in order to conduct investigations. 42. U.S.C. § 10805(a)(C)(3), 42 U.S.C. § \n15043(a)(2)(H),42 C.F.R. § 51.42,45 C.F.R. § 1386.22(f) and 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(2).  This \naccess to facilities expressly includes the right to have access to service recipients \"at all times \nnecessary to conduct a full investigation of an incident of abuse or neglect.  This authority shall \ninclude the opportunity to interview ... the person thought to be the victim of such abuse.\" 42 \nC.F.R. § 51.42(b).  See also 45 C.F.R. § 1386.22(f) and (g). 5  This position has been supported \nby case law.  See Mississippi Protection and Advocacy Syst. v. Cotten, 1989 WL 224953 (S.D. \nMiss. Aug. 7 1989) *8, Robbins v. Budke, 739 F. Supp. 1479, 1489 (D.N.M. 1990).  Neither \nmust the P&A seek permission of a parent or guardian before speaking to service recipient.  Iowa \nProtection and Advocacy Serv., Inc. v. Res-Care Premier, Inc. No. 4-02-CV-10012 (S.D. Iowa \nJuly 8, 2002) (unpublished), slip opinion at 7-8, attached hereto as Attachment 12, Iowa \n5 While both the DD Act and PAlMI speak in terms of \"residents,\" neither statute requires that an individual must \nactually reside in a facility to receive services from a P &A.  See text infra at 16-17. \n15 \n\nProtection and Advocacy Syst., Inc. v. Gerard Treatment Programs L.L.C., IS2 F. Supp.2d IISO, \n1171 (N.D. Iowa 2001). \nIn 1975, prior to enacting PAIMI, Congress adopted the Developmental \nDisabilities and Bill of Rights Act (DO Act) to protect the human and civil rights of individuals \nwith developmental disabilities. 42 U.S.C. §§ . ISOOI et seq.  Congress later enacted PAIMI in \n1986 in response to congressional hearings and investigations evidencing abuse and neglect in \nstate psychiatric facilities. 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-10827.  Protection and advocacy systems were \nestablished to ensure that these vulnerable populations were protected.  Armstrong, 266 F. \nSupp.2d at 309. \nOPA is designated as an \"eligible system.\" 42 U.S.C. §10802(2), 42 U.S.C. § IS043(a), \n29 U.S.C. § 794e(m), Conn. Gen. Stat. § 461-10.  It is mandated to investigate and pursue legal \nremedies for abuse and neglect of persons with disabilities, and to provide them with legal \nrepresentation and advocacy services.  See, ~~ 42 U.S.C. § 1080S(a)(I)(A) and (B), 42 U.s.C. \nIS043(a)(2)(A)(i) and (B), § 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(3).  Federal statutes and regulations require that \nprotection and advocacy systems have access to facilities and to records of individuals with \nmental illness, developmental disabilities and other disabilities. See 42 U.S.C. § 1080S(a)(C)(3), \n42 U.S.C. § 10806,42 U.S.C. § IS043(a)«I)(I), 42 U.S.C. § IS043(a)«I)(H),  42 C.F.R. § \nSI.41-42, 4S C.F.R. § 1386.22(f) 29 U.S.C. § 'l94e(f)(2). \nCourts have consistently held that the DO and P AIMl Acts require states to permit the \nP&A agency to operate effectively, and with broad discretion and independence in gaining \naccess to facilities and records.6  See  supra text at 9-10 and accompanying citations. The court \nin Cotton expounded upon this obligation as follows: \n6 It was Congress' intent that the DD and PAlMI Acts b\" applied in a like manner. See S.Rep.No. 109, 99th Cong., \nI\" Sess. 3 (1986); S.Rep. 113, looth Cong., I\" Sess. 24 (1987), 1987 V.S.C.C.A.N. 781, 803-04; Alabama \n16 \n\nThe Act not only describes the range of services to be provided by the protection and \nadvocacy systems, it also states that the systems must have the authority to perform \nthese services.  The state cannot satisf:y the requirements ofthe [DD Act] by establishing \na protection and advocacy system whi.;h has this authority in theory, but then taking \naction which prevents the system from. exercising that authority. \nth \nMississippi Prot. & Advocacy Sys. Inc. v. Cotton, 929 F.2d 1054, 1058 (5 Cir. 1991)(emphasis \nin original).  As the court noted in Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program v. Tarwarter \nDevelopmental Ctr., any other reading \"would attribute to Congress an intent to pass an \nineffective law.\" Tarwater, 894 F. Supp. at 429. \nIt is also clear that as a public school serving children with disabilities, HTLA is a \n\"facility\" within the definition ofthe P&A statutes.  The P&A Acts do not limit P&A access \nauthority to any particular setting, such as residential facilities.  For example, under the DD Act, \nP&As have \"access at reasonable times to any individual with a developmental disability in a \nlocation in which services, supports, or other assistance are provided to such an individual, in \norder to carry out the purposes ofthis [Act].\"  42 U.S.C. § l5043(a)(2)(H).  PAlMI has a similar \nprovision. 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(C)(3).  Public non-residential schools fall within this definition \nbecause they are \"locations\" providing \"services, supports or other assistance\" to children with \ndisabilities.7  Moreover, P&As have the authOIity and duty to ensure the protection ofthe rights \nof any individual with a developmental disability within a state, regardless of his or her living \narrangement or location where the services are provided.  42 U.S.C. § l5043(a)(2)(A)(i). \nSimilarly, following amendments in 2000, the PAlMI Act extends coverage to persons residing \nin the community, repealing the former requirement that the individual must reside in a \"facility\" \nDisabilities Advocacy Program v. Tarwater Developmental Ctr. . 894 F. Supp. 424, 428 (M.D. Ala. 1995), affirmed, \n~7 F.3d 492 (11th Cir. 1996). \nIn addition to providing traditional classroom educational services to special education students school districts are \nrequired under IDEA to provide appropriate \"related services\" which include, but are not limited to, psychological \nservices, physical and occupational therapy, counseling \"ervices, health and social work services, and parent \ncounseling and training.  34 C.F.R. § 300.24(a). \n17 \n\nto receive P&A services.  42 U.S.C. § 10802(4)(B)(ii).  Finally, as noted above, Congress \nexpressly stated that P&As should be actively involved in monitoring and investigating the \nprovision of education to students with disabilities.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 15001(a)(l) and 15002(2) \nand (10). \nOPA, as the P&A, has the authority to have access to the names and contact infonnation \nof all the students' parents and guardians at HTLA and to have access to the facilities at times the \nstudents are present. 42 U.S.C. § 10806,42 US.C. § 15043(a)(I)(I), 42 C.F.R. §51.41 and 42, 45 \nC.F.R. 1386.22.  Courts have found that P& A requests for infonnation such as names, address \nand phone numbers of individuals for whom the P&A has probable cause to believe have been or \nmay be abused or neglected, are well within the access authority of P & As, as such infonnation \nis necessary in order for the P & A to effectively and fully carry out its mandate such \ninvestigations. See, e.g., Georgia Advocacy Office v. Borison, et al.. 520 S.E.2d. 701 (1999) \n(where Georgia P & A had probable cause to believe that drug trial participants had been abused \nand neglected, the appellate court remanded to superior court with instructions to release all \nrelevant records, including the names, addresses and other contact infonnation for all relevant \nstudy participants to P & A). \nSimilarly, in Pennsylvania Protection & Advocacy, Inc. (PP&A)  v. Royer- Greaves \nSchool for the Blind, 1999 WL 179797 (E.D. Pa. March 25, 1999), the Court held that the \nPennsylvania Protection and Advocacy Inc. was entitled to a list of guardians provided by the \nschool, even though the Protection and Advocacy Agency was unable to provide a sufficient \nbasis of complaints or probable cause to warrant access, and the residents were not clients of the \nP&A.  The Court ruled that even ifthere was masonable grounds for denial of records, the \nfacility still had to provide the P & A with the names and contact infonnation for all of the \n18 \n\nstudents' guardians. rd. at *10.  The Court acl<nowledged that this was a broad power for the \nP&A, but also that requiring the facilities to turn over the guardians' contact information made \nsense.  rd.  In order to obtain authorization, \"the P & A must be able to contact the guardian.  But \nifit does not have the guardians name and contact information, it cannot do so,leaving the P & \n8 \nA with no ability to obtain consent. Requiring that the facility release the contact information \nremedies this dilemma.\" rd. \nThus, in the instant case, HTLA is obligated to release the parent and guardian's contact \ninformation to OPA  .  While under the DO Act and PAIR, OPA has the authority to access this \ncontact information without a sufficient basis of complaints or probable cause, in this case, OP A \nhas received a complaint to the system, and has determined that there is probable cause.  OPA \nhas also determined there is probable cause to suspect abuse and neglect given the failure of \nHTLA to implement individualized behavioral intervention plans that would lessen the need to \nutilize restraint and seclusion. See Aff. of Ganison at ~ 18-20 and Aff. of Centeno at ~ 4-10. \nOP A thus meets the elements necessary to obtain the requested guardian contact information on \nseveral different legal bases. \nDefendants claim they cannot release the directory information to OPA because of IDEA \nand FERPA.  Letter of Bird to OPA at 2. Attaehment 8.  However, case law holds that the P&A \naccess authority prevails over FERPA  's restrictions.  The Court in Michigan Protection and \nAdvocacy Service v. Miller,  849 F. Supp. 1202 (W.O. Mich. 1994), held that the defendant \n8 The DD Act allows access to records without consent of a private non-state agency guardian as long as an effort was made \nto obtain consent, assistance was offered to resolve the situation and the guardian has failed or refused to act on behalf of the \nindividual when the P&A has received a complaint or has probable cause to suspect abuse or neglect.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 15043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(I)-(V). IfOPA is able to obtain the guardian contact information, as noted above, it can still access the \nrecords even if a guardian refuses to authorize release of such records.  45 C.F.R. 1386.22(a)(3)(i)-(iii). As held in \nDisability Law Center v. Reil. 130 F. Supp. 2d 294 (D. Mass, 2001), OPA as the designated Protection and Advocacy \nagency for the State of Connecticut, has access rights to records mandated notwithstanding the \"good faith\" refusal of \nguardians to authorize the release of such records,  At the cmrent time, OPA is not seeking such access, \n19 \n\ncould not rely on FERPA   or the IDEA to deny a P&A access to records it needed to conduct an \ninvestigation.  The Court noted that, \"[FERPA] does prohibit federal finding to educational \ninstitutions which permit the release of records without parental consent.  The DD, PAlMI and \nPAIR Acts, however, clearly mandate that organizations like [Michigan Protection and \nAdvocacy System] have the authority to access DSS facilities and records in specific cases where \nthe developmentally disabled and mentally ill individuals are involved.  Defendant's reliance on \nthe IDEA is misplaced.\"  Id. at 1208. \nSimilarly, in the instant matter, as in Miller, OPA, as the Protection and Advocacy \nagency for the State of Connecticut, is seeking access to the facilities so that OPA can pursue its \ninvestigation of allegations of abuse and neglect at HTLA.  As the P&A, OPA has a duty of \nconfidentiality under §42 U.S.C. § 10806(a) and (b), 45 C.F.R. 1386.22(e)(1)-(3), for any \ninformation obtained by a P&A about clients or potential clients, barring any disclosure of such \ninformation to third-parties.  Armstrong, 266 F. Supp.2d at 310-311. See also Czaplewski, 131 F. \nSupp.2d at 1052 (Court ruled that the resident!: of a nursing home would suffer no privacy harm \nbecause of confidentiality restrictions on P & As.)9 This facility access is part of the foundation \nof the P&A's authority, and has consistently been upheld. See Mississippi Prot. & Advocacy \nSys. Inc. v. Cotton, 929 F.2d 1054 (5th Cir. 1991). \nThus, OPA is likely to win on the merits of this case because as part ofits investigation, \nOPA has the authority to the contact information of parents and guardians and the authority to \naccess the facility.  Additionally, as OPA is bound by the confidentiality provisions of the DD \n9  Notably, there appears to be one case holding otherwise; however, both the lower court's decision and the one page \norder from the appellate court, affirming the trial court decillion, were unpublished with no precedential effect under the \ncourt's rules.  Washington Protection and Adyocacy Svc v. Evergreen Sch. Dist, 71 Fed.Appx. 654, 2003 WL 21751827 \n(9th Cir. 2003) (P&A access authority did not trump FERPA's restrictions on releasing information).  In addition, the \nCourt's analysis was deficient because it did not address the fact that the regulations implementing the DD Act, 45 CFR \n20 \n\nAct and PAlMI barring any third-party disclosure of such information there is no risk of any \nharm to the students' privacy.  Armstrong. 266 F. Supp. 2d. at 320.  See also Arizona Ctr. for \nDisability Law v. Allen, 197 F.R.D. 689, 692 (D. Ariz. 2000).  Consequently, Defendants' \nreliance on state and federal statutes and regulations dealing with disclosure of student \ninformation is misplaced. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs request that this Court issue a preliminary \ninjunction and thereafter a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from continuing to refuse \nPlaintiffs access to the HTLA facilities at times students are present and to the directory \ninformation ofthe parents and guardians ofthe students in pursuit of its statutory obligation to \ninvestigate suspected incidents of abuse and neglect.  Furthermore, the Court should enjoin the \nDefendants from engaging in similar acts in the future and order the Defendants to immediately \ngive Plaintiffs the access requested. \nRespectfully submitted, \nThe Plaintiffs, \nThe State of Connecticut \nOffice of Protection and Advocacy \nFor Persons with Disabilities \nJ  es McGaughey \nBy:  ~_Co 0 .. \nBER~'> \nNANCY B.

I have been employed as a Human Services Advocate at the State of \nConnecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities \n(OPA) at 60B Weston Street, Hartford, CT 06120 since 1990.  My area of \nspecialization is Special Edueation.

I have a Bachelor of Arts from Northwest College, Kirkland, Washington. \n4.  As part of my work as a Human Services Advocate, I have served children \nwho attended the Hartford Transitional Learning Academy [HTLA] At least \ntwo of these children were restrained and secluded while at HTLA. \n5.  One of these children was restrained on numerous occasions.  He complained \nthat he was treated roughly, and he developed bruises as a result of the \nrestraints.  He also reported being held tightly enough to cause pain. \n6.  He also frequently placed in seclusion.  On one occasion he complained that \nhis armed was forced behind his back as he was escorted to the \"time-out\" \nroom. \n7.  On information and belief, [Ie developed panic attacks as a result of the stress \nofthis situation. \n8.  Another client also reported being restrained frequently.  This child also \nsuffered from bruising as a result of the restraints. \n9.  I have also heard reports that children served by Padres Abriendo Puertas, an \nagency housed in OP A offi,~es, also reported being restrained.  One such client \nreported on one occasion re:ceiving rug bums on the face due to a prone \nrestraint.  On information and belief there are photographs documenting this \nlIlJUry. \n10.  In 2002, on a professionalllisit to the HTLA facility at 110 Washington \nStreet, I observed a child who was subject to a prone 4-point restraint in the \nmiddle of the school hallway.  I have no reason to believe that the practices at \nHTLA regarding restraint have changed in 2002. \n2 \n\n'i. \n! \n.. \n,~ \n,I \n,I \nif \n.1 \n,I \nI \n\nReport Cards \nGrade Equivalents: \nA+  97  C+  77  F  59 and below \nA  =  92  C  =  72 \nA- =  90  C- =  70 \nB+  =  87  D+  =  67 \nB  =  82  D  =  62 \nB- =  80  D- 60 \nHigh school credits will be detennined by the guidelines of the student's district school. \nStandards of Student Behavior/Beha.vior Management Plans \nHTLA is a therapeutic program for students with emotional and behavioral needs who \nhave been referred, through the PPT process, to modify their behaviors so that they may \nexperience success in their district school.

My name is Bruce Garrison.  I am over 18 years of age and I understand the \nobligations of an oath. \n2.  I have been employed as a Human Services Advocate at the State of \nConnecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities \n(OPA) at 608 Weston Street, Hartford, CT  06120 for 17 years.  My area of \nspecialization is Special Education. I have provided advocacy services for \nover 600 families and their children receiving special education and related \nservices throughout the state of Connecticut. \n\n3.  I have a Master's Degree in Education/Special Education from the University \nof Connecticut and have my teacher certification in the areas of regular and \nspecial education. \n4.  During the fall and winter of2003-2004 I was assigned to work as part of a \nteam to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect at the Hartford \nTransitional Learning Academy.  The team doing the investigation included \nstaff from OPA as well as staff from the State of Connecticut, Office of Child \nAdvocate (OCA). \n5.  On information and belief, Both OPA and OCA had received complaints \nalleging abuse and neglect concerning the misapplication of restraints and \nseclusion at the HTLA facility.  OPA therefore had probable cause to conduct \nan investigation under our f<ederal mandates. \n6.  On information and belief, OPA has authority under those federal mandates to \nvisit the HTLA facility and observe the students in their environment. \n7.  On February 3,2004 the Ex'ecutive Director ofOPA, James McGaughey and \nthe Child Advocate, Jeanne Milstein, sent a letter to Robert Henry, \nSuperintendent of the Hartford Public Schools informing him that the offices \nwould be conducting an investigation of the HTLA programs.  The letter \nfurther informed Superintendent Henry that investigators would be making \ntheir initial visit to the HTLA facility at 110 Washington Street, Hartford, CT \non Tuesday, February 10 at 9:00 am. \n2 \n\n8.  On Tuesday, February 10,2004 I met Faith Vos Winkel, an Assistant Child \nAdvocate from OCA, and together we walked to HTLA where we arrived at \napproximately 8:30 am. \n9.  We entered the building and went directly to the school office where we \nsigned in.  We showed the clerk at the desk our ID's and Ms. Vos Winkel \ninformed her that we were from the Office of the Child Advocate and from the \nOffice of Protection and Advocacy.  She requested that we meet with Barbara \nMcCauley, the principal ofHTLA. \n10.  We were informed that Ms. McCauley was not in her office, and we were \nasked to take a seat and wait until she could be contacted. \n11.  While we waited we observ,ed students, parents and teachers coming and \ngoing into the office.  AlthoLlgh the office was a public area, we heard \nstudents referred to by name:.  We also observed a large \"transportation roster\" \nin the main corridor of the school that contained student names and bus routes. \nFinally, when we signed into the building, next to the sign-in book on the \ncounter in the school office was a schedule ofPPT's that were to be held that \nday listed by student name.  There was no apparent effort to maintain the \nprivacy of students in this public waiting area. \n12.  We waited for approximately 20-25 minutes.  At that time Ms. McCauley \nentered the school office, greeted us and invited us into her office.  Once \nthere, Ms. Vos Winkel informed her that we were there to initiate an \ninvestigation into HTLA. \n3 \n\n13.  Ms. McCauley expressed surprise, and said that she had not been informed \nthat we would be there that day.  Ms. Vos Winkel informed her that a letter \nhad been sent to Superintendent Henry by OCA and OP A and Ms. McCauley \ntold us that she had not seen the letter nor been told anything about it.  She \nthen asked us what kind of linvestigation we were there to conduct. \n14.  Ms. Vos Winkel told her that today we wanted to look at documents relating \nto policies, procedures and program descriptions of HTLA.  She also stated \nthat we would be setting up subsequent visits to observe the programs at \nHTLA and to talk to faculty.  She further informed Ms. McCauley that we \nwould not be looking at confidential records on that day. \n15.  Ms. McCauley continued to express puzzlement as to why we were there.  She \npointed to a large stack of documents and stated that representatives from the \nCenter for Children's AdvoGacyhadjust been there to review documents and \nshe asked if we were connected to her investigation.  We informed her that we \nwere not and that we were conducting a separate investigation.  Ms. \nMcCauley then asked who bad made the \"referrals'.' to us, and Ms. Vos \nWinkel told her that information was confidential, but that OCA had indeed \nreceived complaints. \n16.  Ms. McCauley told her that .she didn't have a problem with our being there, \nbut that she would have to check with the \"administration.\"  She left her office \nand returned some 10 minutes later.  She informed us that she had spoken \nwith Ann Bird, the Assistant Corporation Counsel, she advised her not to let \n4 \n\nus into the facility until they could find the letter.  Ms. McCauley then asked \nus to leave, and we did so without beginning our investigation. \n17.  To this date we have still not received pennission to return to HTLA, and \nother than receiving certain documents we have unable to conduct our \ninvestigation of the facility. \n18.  As part of my work as a Human Services Advocate at OPA, I learned that \nstudents are placed at Students are also placed at HTLA without having \nreceived a functional behavioral assessment or without having a behavioral \nintervention plan in their re·~ord. \n19.  The only \"plan\" these students have is that contained in the \"Hartford \n,  Transitional Learning Academy, Student and Parent Handbook\" at 12.  This \nhandbook sets forth \"Standards of Student BehaviorlBehavior Management \nPlans.\" This general plan fails to provide a individualized plan for each \nparticular child. \n20.  Based on my experience as ;a Human Services Advocate and based upon my \neducational experience, the failure to have an individualized behavioral \nintervention plan places students at risk of inappropriate restraint and \nseclusion, and thus at risk of abuse and neglect. \n5 \n\n-t.. \nBigned and sworn to before me this~\"'\\ day of \n\":j=\"-__'  \n_-_:\\. .. ..>. =\\  2004 \n~.~~~~-'<---\nCommission \n6 \n\n\n\nSTATE OF CONNECTICUT \nOFFICE OF THE CHILD ADVOCATE \nJeanne Milstein  18-20 TRINITY ,sTREET, HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT 06106 \nChild Advocate \nFebruary 3, 2004 \nRobert Henry, Superintendent \nHartford Public Schools \n960 Main Street, 8th floor \nHartford, CT 06103 \nRe:  Hartford Transitional Learning Academy \nDear Superintendent Henry: \nWe are writing to notify you that both the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) and the \nOffice of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities (OP A) have received \ncomplaints regarding the provision of educational and related services to Hartford \nstudents being served in the Hartford Transitional Learning Academy (HTLA) programs. \nWe will be investigating jointly alleged programmatic deficiencies and violations of \nstudent rights pursuant to authority established in sections 46a-13q and sections 46a-11 \nthrough 46a-13a of the COnilecticut General Statutes, and 42 U.S.C. § 15001 et. seq.; 42 \nU.S.C. § 15043; and 29 U.S.C. § 794(e) et. seq. \nInvestigators from OCA and OPA will be making their initial visit to the 110 Washington \nStreet site ofHTLA on Tuesday, February 10,2004 at 9 a.m.  We anticipate the \ninvestigation to include policy review, record review, interviews and direct observation \nof practices.

I have been employed at the State of Connecticut Office of the Child \nAdvocate COCA\") at \\8-20 Trinity Street, Hartford, CT 06106 since August \n10, 200 I.  I currently am acting as an Assistant Child Advocate.  In this \nposition, my responsibilities include conducting fatality reviews/investigations \nregarding all unexplained unexpected child deaths and manage most of the \ncasework related to special education issues and children with disabilities. \n\nPreviously, for approximately fifteen years, I worked at the State of \nConnecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities \n(OPA) at 60B Weston Street, Hartford, CT 06120 as an Assistant Program \nDirector, supervising Human Service Advocates.  For approximately four of \nthose years, I was the Acting Program Director overseeing the investigatory \nand advocacy divisions. \n3.  I have a Bachelor's Degree from the University of Connecticut and currently \nam pursuing a master's degree in social work from the University of \nConnecticut. \n4.  During the fall and winter of 2003-2004, OCA and OPA began discussions \nconceming allegations of program deficiencies, improper restraint and \nseclusion techniques and safi:ty concerns at Hartford Transition Learning \nAcademy (HTLA).  Numerous high level inter-agency meetings took place to \ndiscuss the manner in which these allegations might be investigated, \nculminating in OCA and OPA entering into a joint investigatory agreement. \n5.  I was assigned as lead investigator for OCA.  Mr. Bruce Garrison, a Human \nServices Advocate at OPA, was named lead investigator for OPA. \n6.  On February 3, 2004 the Executive Director of OPA, James McGaughey and \nthe Child Advocate, Jeanne Milstein, sent a letter to Robert Henry, \nSuperintendent of the Hartford Public Schools informing him that their offices \nwould be conducting a joint investigation of the HTLA programs.  The letter \nfurther informed Superintendent Henry that investigators would be making \n\ntheir initial visit to the HTLA facility at 110 Washington Street, Hartford, CT \non Tuesday, February 10,2004 at 9:00 a.m. \n7.  In order to conduct a proper investigation of the allegations at HTLA, it is \nimperative that we be allow(~d to observe students in their school environment. \n8.  On Tuesday, February 10,2004 I met Mr. Garrison, and together we walked \nto HTLA, arriving at approximately 9:00 a.m. \n9.  We entered the building and went directly to the school's office where we \nsigned in.  We showed the clerk at the desk our ID' s and I informed her that \nwe were from the Office of the Child Advocate and from the Office of \nProtection and Advocacy and requested that we meet with Barbara McCauley, \nthe principal ofHTLA. \n10.  We were informed that Ms. McCauley was not presently available, and we \nwere asked to take a seat and wait until she could see us. \n11.  While we waited we observed students, teachers and other adults coming and \ngoing into the office.  When we signed into the building, next to the sign-in \nbook on the counter in the school office was a schedule ofPPT's that were to \nbe held that day listed by student name.  This schedule was in plain view.  We \nalso observed, in the main corridor of the school, a large \"transportation \nroster\" posted on one of the hallway'S walls, that contained students' first and \nlast names, home addresses and bus routes.  I pointed this roster out to Mr. \nGarrison. \n\n12.  We waited for approximately 20-25 minutes.  At that time Ms. McCauley \ngreeted us and invited us into her office.  Once there, I informed her that we \nwere there to initiate an investigation into HTLA. \n13.  Ms. McCauley expressed surprise, and said that she had not been informed \nthat we would be there that day.  I informed her that a courtesy letter had been \nsent to Superintendent Henry by OCA and OPA notifYing him of our intention \nto investigate HTLA.  I further stressed that this letter was a mere formality. \nMs. McCauley told us that she had not seen the letter nor been told anything \nabout it.  She then asked us what kind of investigation we were there to \nconduct. \n14.  I told Ms. McCauley that today we wanted to look at documents relating to \npolicies, procedures and program descriptions of HTLA,  I also stated that we \nwould be setting up subsequent visits to observe the programs at HTLA and to \ntalk to facuIty.  I further informed Ms. McCauley that we would not be going \ninto confidential student records on that day, although we would like a tour of \nthe school building. \nIS.  Ms. McCauley continued to express puzzlement as to why we were there.  She \npointed to a large stack of documents and stated that representatives of the \nCenter for Children's Advocacy had just been there to review documents and \nshe asked if we were connected to that investigation.  I informed her that we \nwere not and that we were conducting a separate investigation.  Ms. \nMcCauley then asked who had made the \"referrals\" to us, and I told her that \ninformation was confidential,. but that OCA had indeed received complaints. \n\n16.  Ms. McCauley told us that she didn't have a problem with our being there, but \nthat she would have to check with the \"administration.\"  She left her office \nand returned some 10 minutes later.  She informed us that she had spoken \nwith Ann Bird, the Assistant Corporation Counsel, who advised her not to let \nus into the facility until they could find the letter.  Ms. McCauley then asked \nus to leave, and we did so without beginning our investigation. \n17.  Prior to departing HTLA, I again tried to impress upon Ms. McCauley the \nparameters of the Child Advocate's statutory authority and that we did not \nintend to review confidential material that day. \n18.  To this date we still have not gained access into HTLA in order to properly \nconduct our investigation. \n~~L ~ Wt-~ l(z~ \nFa:ith VosWinkel \nAs:,istant Child Advocate \nTI\\ \nSigned and sworn to before me this~() day of \n_~'2004 \n~-1~~~~~~~~~~~ ____ \nCommissiolll(r 0  he Superior Court \nIV\\CluVeer\\ ~ulo.. .... \n\n\n\nSTATE OF CONNECTICUT \nOFFICE OF PROTECTION AND  ADVOCACY FOR \nPERSONS WITH DISABILITIES \n60B WESTON STREET, HARTFORD, CT  06\\20-\\55\\ \nApril 12, 2004 \nAnn F. Bird \nAssistant Corporation Counsel \nCity of Hartford \n550 Main Street - Room 210 \nHartford, CT 06103 \nDear Ms. Bird: \nIt was a pleasure meeting you on Wednesday, April 7 at the offices of the Child \nAdvocate, I am pleased to provide you with information regarding the federal statutes \nthat govern the work of the Office of Protection and Advocacy.  I am certain that after \nyou review these statutes that you will understand that we have the authority to have \naccess to the facilities that comprise HTLA while the students are present.  Furthermore, \nyou will come to understand that we have the authority to obtain the names of the parents \nand guardians of these students so that we may seek authorization to obtain their records. \nPut more simply, our federal authority iiUpercedes the privacy provisions of the Family \nEducational Rights and Privacy Act [FERPA]. \nAs I mentioned during our meeting, there are three statutes that are relevant to the \ninvestigation being undertaken by OCA and OPA.  They are the Protection and \nAdvocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act [PAlMI], 42 U.S.c, §§ 10801 -\n10807, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act [DD Act], 42 \nU,S.c, §§ 15041- 15045, and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act \n[PAIR], 29 U.S,c, 794e,  PAlMI is implemented by regulations at 42 CFR Part 51, and \nthe DD Act at 45 CFR 1386.20-25.  PAIR provides that it shall have the same access \nas the DD Act.  29 U.S.c, 794e (0(2). \nAs a review of the case law will show you, courts have uniformly held that the \nP&A access authorities require facilities to permit the P&A to operate with broad \ndiscretion and independence in gaining access to facilities and records for investigative \npurposes,  One case that I would particularly suggest that you read is Michigan \nProtection and Advocacy Service, Inc. v. Miller, 849 F. Supp. 1202 (W.D. Mich. 1994). \nMiller addresses the right of the Michigan P&A to obtain access to a juvenile facility \nand to records of individuals in that facility notwithstanding objections from the \nfacility.  I would also suggest you read Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons \nwith Disabilities v. Armstrong, 266 F. SUpp. 2d 202 (D. Conn. 2003).  This case will \nPhone: 1/860-297-4300, 1/800-842-7303; TDD; 1/860-566-2102: FAX: 1/860-566-8714 \nWWW.state.ct.us/opapd \nINTERNET SITE: \nAn Affirnwtive ActIOn I Equal Opporfllnit\\' Emplover \n\ngive you a good idea of how broadly P&A access has been construed by the one \nConnecticut Court that has had the opportunity to do so as yet. \nAgain, I am confident that after a review of the statutes and the case law, we will \nbe permitted to conduct our investigation utilizing the full extent of our authority. \nPlease be assured that this office will act with complete discretion and will comply with \nour requirements to maintain confidential all student information.

Alisberg \nManaging Attorney \nOffice of Protection and Advocacy \nFor Persons With Disabilities \n60B Weston Street \nHartford, CT  06120-1551 \nRe:  HTLA \nDear Attorney Alisberg: \nThank  you  for  your  letter  of April  12,  2004.  Now  that  I have  reviewed  the \nauthorities  provided  in  your  letter and  conducted  additional  research,  I  remain \nfirmly convinced that neither these nor other legal authorities allow or require the \nHartford Public Schools to provide your office with access to confidential student \nrecords or to the HTLA facility while students are attending. \nOf the statutes you cited, The Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental \nIllness  Act (PAlMI)  would  seem  closest to  applying to  HTLA's students.  That \nstatute,  however,  addresses  protection  and advocacy for  persons with  significant \nmental illness who are inpatient or resident in a facility, or in the process of being \nadmitted to a facility, or incarcerated.  42 CRF Section 51.2.  The HTLA students \ngenerally do not meet this definition, as they are neither inpatient nor incarcerated, \nat least while attending HTLA. \nEven if PAlMI  did  apply  to  the  HTLA  students,  however, PAlMI  provides that \nP&A may have access to records only under circumstances that do not apply here. \nP&A may have access to records of (a) persons who are clients of P&A and who \nhave  authorized  such  access;  (b)  persons  whose  mental  condition  prevents  self \nauthorization  and  who  have  no  guardian  or  other  representative  who  can  give \nauthorization  and  where  P&A  has  a specific complaint or probable  cause as  to \n\nAttorney Nancy B. Alisberg  Page 2 \nMay 3, 2004 \nneglect or abuse; or (c) persons who have guardians or conservators who have not \nresponded to requests for authorization and where P&A has a complaint or probable \ncause to believe there is a serious or immediate threat to health or safety.  42 U.S.C. \nSection 10805(a)(1X4).  These conditions do not apply to HTLA students. \nPAlMI also clearly does not require or permit Hartford Public Schools to provide \nP&A with access to the HTLA facility.  Although PAlMI indicates that a P&A may \n\"have access to facilities in the State providing care or treatment\", the regulations \nclearly define \"facility\" to include only residential facilities.  42 CFR Section 51.2. \nHTLA  is  not  a  residential  program  and  does  not  provide  residential  services. \nStudents return to their parents or guardians each day after school. \nSimilarly,  the  Developmental  Disabilities Assistance and  Bill of Rights Act (DD \nAct) does not apply to HTLA students because they do not meet the definition of \npersons  with  a  \"developmental  disability\"  under  the  Act.  42  U.S.C.  Section \n15002(8) defines developmental disability to mean \"a severe, chronic disability of \nan individual that ... results in substantial functional limitations in 3 or more ... \n[defined] areas of major life activity.\"  Although some HTLA students may have \ndevelopmental deficits, these tend to be slight.  Even if some HTLA students did \nhad  developmental  disabilities,  however,  the  DD  Act's  provision  for  access  to \nrecords  is  very  similar  to  PAlMI's  provision,  and  does  not  apply  here,  in  the \nabsence of individualized authorization by a parent or adult student.  See 42 U.S.C. \nSection 15043(a)(2)(I). \nFinally,  the  Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights  Act (PAIR),  provides \nfunding  for  organizations  such  as  yours,  but  does  not  vest  your  agency  with \nadditional powers or authority. \nIn addition,  the judicial decisions that you cited, while  interesting, all  deal with \nsituations very unlike HTLA's because they involve residential facilities, deceased \ndisabled  individuals, or severely disabled people who have no guardians and are \nincapable of seeking assistance or authorizing access to their own records by virtue \nof their disabilities. \nHTLA's  students  are  either  capable  Df advocating  for  themselves  or providing \nauthorization  for  access  or have parents or other guardians  who  are capable of \nadvocating and consenting to access.  Nor are HTLA students and their parents so \ndisabled or isolated that they are unable to either seek assistance or to consent to \naccess by P&A.  Obviously, if any HTLA students are clients of P&A and P&A has \nreceived  authorization  for release of records, we  will  honor those authorizations. \nOtherwise, Hartford may not disclose records or identity parents or guardians or \n\nAttorney Nancy B. Alisberg  Page 3 \nMay 3, 2004 \nprovide access to students at HTLA b'~cause to do so would violate FERPA   and is \nnot mandated by PAlMI, the DD Act or (PAIR). \nThank you for your courtesy and consideration in this regard. \nSincerely, \n~~ \nAnn F.

That \ninvestigatory authority includes the right to have access to the facilities and to the \nrequested directory information.  Your failure to comply with this authority constitutes a \nviolation ofOPA's rights.  We hope to b,! able to settle this matter without resorting to \nlitigation.

Alisberg \nManaging Attorney \nState Office of Protection And Advocacy \nFor Persons With Disabilities \n60B Weston Street \nHartford, CT  06120-1551 \nRe:  Access to HTLA Facilities and Directory Information \nDear Attorney Alisberg: \nThank you for your letter of July 20, 2.004.  Your letter's claim that the Hartford \nPublic Schools has refused the Office of Protection and Advocacy access to the \nHTLA facilities is inaccurate.  As you know, during our meeting on April 7, 2004, \nSuperintendent  Henry  made  clear  that  access  to  the  HTLA  facility  and \nadministration (but not students) will  be provided at a mutually convenient time \nupon request.  Superintendent Henry asked that communications to arrange such \naccess be made through Acting SupeIintendent Amador Mojica.  In fact, I also \nconfirmed this officer in a letter of April 30, 2004 to Faith Voswinkel, Protection \nand Advocacy's \"co-investigator\" from the Office of the Child Advocate. \nI do not believe Protection and Advocacy has contacted Mr.  Mojica to arrange \niluch a meeting or access to the facility. \nAs I also indicated during the April  7, 2004 meeting and in my letter to you of \nMay  3, 2004, however, the Hartford  Public Schools cannot allow access to the \nstudents themselves, absent individualized authorization, because to do so would \nviolate its obligations under FERP A.  [also provided a detailed explanation as to \nwhy the federal authorizing statutes for the Office of Protection and Advocacy do \nnot authorize such access in my letter of May 3, 2004.  You have not responded to \nmy letter or otherwise indicated disagreement with its conclusions. \n\nAttorney Nancy B. Alisberg  Page 2  July 22, 2004 \n, \nYour claim that the Hartford Public Schools has denied the Office of Protection \nand  Advocacy  Directory  information  for  the  parents  and  guardians  of HTLA \nstudents  is  also  puzzling  because  that  information  has  never  actually  been \nrequested.  The only documents that have been requested were requested by the \nOffice of the Child Advocate,  and  those documents were provided.  Even if a \nrequest had been made for a list of parents and guardians, however, FERP A also \nprohibits  the  Hartford  Public  Schools from  providing that data.  The Hartford \nPublic  Schools  has  not  followed  a  practice  of notii'ying  HTLA  parents  and \nguardians that their names and addresses would be disclosed upon request, and has \nnot  afforded  them  the  opportunity  to  prevent  that  disclosure.  Under  those \ncircumstances, FERPA prohibits disclosure of the names and addresses of parents \nand guardians. \nSincerely, \n~~4 \nAnn F.

's (\"Iowa P \n& A\") motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, filed contemporaneously \nwith its complaint on February 26, 2002.1  The Court held a hearing on March 11, 2002, and \ndefendant filed a resistance memorandum on March 13, 2002.  The motion is fully submitted. \nL  BACKGROUND \nIowa P & A is a private, non-profit corporation operating under three separate federal \nstatutes: the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of2000, 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 15041 et seq. (\"P ADD\"); the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mentallllness Act, \n42 US.C. §§ 10801 et seq. (\"PAIMI\"); and the Protection and Advocacy ofIndividual Rights \nAct, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794e et seq. (\"PAIR\").  Iowa P & A's mission is to protect the rights of \npersons with developmental disabilities, mental illness disabilities and certain other disabilities. \nThe State ofIowa has designated Iowa P & A as an appropriate agency for investigating \nallegations of abuse and neglect of person:; covered under these statutes. \nDefendant Res-Care Premier, Inc. (\"Res-Care\") operates Victorian Acres Rehabilitation \nAlthough the motion is styled as a temporary restraining order, the Court notes defendant \n1 \nparticipated in the hearing and was represented by counseL \n1\"I~1l1J ~. \n\n(\"Victorian Acres\").  Victorian Acres is II residential facility in Altoona, Iowa that cares for \npersons with traumatic brain injuries. \nOn December 30,2001, a Victorian Acres resident, to whom the Court shall refer as \"r,\" \nwas involved in an incident with a Victoriian Acres staff member.  According to Res-Care, T had \nan outburst which required redirection from the staff member.  While attempting to move T into a \nwheelchair, the staff member stumbled and both resident and staff member feU to the ground. \nRes-Care states that T sustained a \"scratch on his buttock area.\"  Victorian Acres did not \nimmediately report the incident to the Iowa Department ofInspections and Appeals, (\"DIA\"), the \nlicensing body for the State ofIowa, because it did not believe that any abuse had occurred. \nIn mid-January 2002, Res-Care mille the decision to terminate an employee by the name \nof \"Irene\" for alleged verbal abuse of residents.  During her exit interview, Irene made a vague \nreference to an incident of abuse of resident T.  Although Irene did not give a date on which the \nincident allegedly occurred, Victorian Acres administrators reviewed the records and determined \nIrene likely was referring to the December 30, 2001 incident.  Both Res-Care, and DIA, whom \nRes-Care had contacted, then conducted independent investigations of the incident.  The \nVeterans Administration, the agency responsible for payment ofT's care  in the facility, also \nconducted an investigation.  Res-Care clai ms that none of the three groups could confirm that \nabuse had occurred. \nOn or about January 29,2002, Iowa P & A received a complaint from a concerned \nindividual that resident \"T\" had been physically assaulted.2  The version of events provided to \nIowa P & A differs from those presented by Res-Care.  According to Iowa P & A, a staff member \ndragged T outside of the building without his pants, which resulted in a five-inch wound to T's \nbackside and buttocks.  On January 31, 2002, David Parr, disability rights advocate and educator \nfor Iowa P & A, contacted Victorian Acre!!, and spoke with Eric Cantu, then acting administrator. \nAlthough the individual is known to plaintiff, the individual prefers to remain anonymous \n2 \nto defendant and/or the public to ensure no retaliatory action is taken against resident T. \n2 \n\nMr. Parr informed Mr. Cantu that Iowa P & A was authorized to investigate the alleged assault, \nand requested information regarding the incident. Mr. Cantu asked Mr. Parr to provide him with \na formal written request.  He then told Mr. Parr that he did not have the authority to release \nconfidential patient records, but would gIlt back to him.  Mr. Cantu stated during the hearing that \nafter speaking with Res-Care management, he called Mr. Parr later in the day and told him Res \nCare was unable to release the information requested. \nThe following day, Mr. Parr, along with Marsha Gelina and Bonnie Kerns of the Iowa P & \nA, went to Victorian Acres to investigate the alleged assault.  Mr. Cantu met the three individuals \nin the parking lot.  The individuals told Mr. Cantu they were investigators from the Iowa P & A, \nand that they had probable cause to believe that a physical assault had taken place at the facility, \nand planned to investigate.  It appears only one of the Iowa P & A representatives produced a \nbusiness card.  Mr. Cantu asked the. three to leave. \nShortly thereafter, a woman named Melissa Gonzalez came out of the facility to speak \nwith the individuals.3  Mr. Parr produced Itwo form letters outlining the statutory authority on \nwhich Iowa P & A bases its right to access a facility, and purporting to announce the reason for \nthis particular investigation.  One of these letters, attached to the complaint as \"Exhibit B,\" \nindicated that Iowa P & A intended to conduct a \"routine monitoring\" of the facility.  The second \nletter, introduced during the hearing as Exhibit 1, indicated that Iowa P & A was investigating an \nalleged sexual assault at a Dallas County care facility.  Ms. Gonzalez stated that she would need \nto confer with the facility administrator and legal counsel regarding the letters.  Meanwhile, Mr. \nParr proceeded to take photographs of the facility grounds. \nA woman identified only as \"Julie\" then came out of the facility and stated the three were \non private property and must leave.  Ms. Gelina asked if Julie understood the basis for Iowa P \n&A's authority, and Julie again stated the :individuals were on private property and should leave. \nIt appears that Ms. Gonzalez works in an unidentified capacity at Res-Care's corporate \n3 \nheadquarters. \n3 \n\nThe three individuals left the property shortly thereafter. \nPlaintiff filed its present complai~t seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on February \n26, 2002.  In its complaint, Iowa P & A urges this Court to declare that Res-Care's \"policies, \nregulations, practices and conduct of interfering with and denying Iowa P &A proper and \n~mediate access violates 29 U.S.C. section 794e and 42 U.S.C. section 105041, et seq,\" and to \nboth preliminarily and permanently enjoin Res-Care from denying Iowa P & A its requested \naccess.  Complaint ~~ 35-37. \nIn resisting Iowa P & A's requesl: for preliminary injunctive relief, Res-Care states it does \nnot contest the agency's general authority to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect, but \ndisputes that probable cause exists to initiate an investigation in the present case.  It also seeks to \nclarifY \nthe parameters of any lawful investigation that may result. \nn. \nAPPLICABLE LAW AND DISCUSSION \nA.  Law Governing Preliminary Injunctive Relief \nIn determining whether to grant preliminary injunctive relief, this Court must \nconsider the following factors: 1) plaintiffs' probability of success on the merits; 2) the threat of \nirreparable harm to plaintiffs; 3) the balance between this harm and potential harm to others if \nreliefis granted; and 4) whether an injunction serves the public interest.  Sanborn Mfg. Co., Inc. \nv. Campbell Hausfeld/Scott Fetzer Co., 997 F.2d 484, 485 (8th Cir. 1993) (citing Dataphase \nSys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc, 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981»).  The same factors are used to \nevaluate a request for a temporary restraining order.  See S.B. Mclaughlin & Co. v. Tudor Oaks \nCondominium Project, 877 F.2d 707, 708 (8th Cir. 1989); Sports Design & Development, Inc. v. \nSchoneboom, 871 F. Supp. 1158, 1162-65 (N.D. Iowa 1995). \nB.  Probability of Success on the Merits \nI.  Whether Residents Covered by Iowa P & A Directives \nThe Eighth Circuit has held that although no one Dataphase factor is dispositive, see, e.g., \n4 \n\nCalvin Klein Cosmetics Corp. v. Lenox Lab., 815 F.2d 500, 503 (8th Cir. 1987), a plaintiff's \nprobability of success should generally be given considerable weight.  S & M Constructors, Inc. v. \nFoley Co., 959 F.2d 97, 98 (8th Cir. 1992); Tullos v. Parks, 915 F.2d 1192, 1196 (8th Cir. 1990). \nAccordingly, the Court will begin by addressing the merits of plaintifi's complaint. \nAs set forth above, based on a complaint received in January 2002, Iowa P & A currently \nseeks access to the records of resident T, whom it believes has been subject to neglect or abuse, \nas well as those of all individuals residing in the Victorian Acres facility.  Res-Care rejects Iowa P \n& A's request on several grounds.  Flfst, Res-Care argues that no showing has been made that the \nfederal authority under which Iowa P & A operates apply to the brain-injured individuals currently \nresiding in defendant's facility.  Admittedly, the PADD and PAlMI programs are directed toward \nindividuals ~th developmental and mental. illness disabilities, respectively.  See P ADD, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 15041 (P ADD program created to protect the legal and human rights of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities); PAJMI, 42 U.S.C. § 10803 (PAIMI Act designed to \"protect and \nadvocate the rights of individuals with mental illness ....\" ).  The PAIR program was created, \nhowever, to provide the same protection and advocacy services for individuals with disabilities \nwho were otherwise ineligible for the services under either the P ADD or PAlMI programs.  29 \nU.S.C. § 794e(a)(I)(A)-(B)(u)! \nThe statute does not expressly state that individuals with tranmatic brain injuries are \n•  Specifically, PAIR was enacted: \nTo protect the legal and human rights of individuals with disabilities who -\n(A) need services that are beyond the scope of services authorized to be provided by \nthe client assistance program under section 732 of this title; and \n(B)(i) are ineligible for proh:ction and advocacy programs IUlder subtitle \nC of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 \n[42 U.S.C.A. § 15041 el seq.] because the individuals do not have a developmental \ndisability, as defined in section 102 of such Act; (42 U.S.C. § 6002); and \n(ii) are ineligible for services under the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally TIl \nIndividuals Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. § 10801 e/ seq.) because the individuals are not \nindividuals with mental illness as defined in section 102 of such Act. \n29 U.S.C. § 794e(a)(1 )(A)-(B)(ii). \n5 \n\ncovered under the PAIR program.  Nevertheless, since this type of disability cannot \nappropriately be categorized as mental ill[less, under P AIMl, or developmental, under P ADD, the \nCourt finds that individuals with traumatic brain injuries fall within the scope of the PAIR \nprogram. \n2.  Whether Iowa P & A is Entitled to Access Resident T's Records \nRes-Care also argues that Iowa P & A has failed to fulfill the statutory directives which \nwould entitle it to access facility records.  Specifically, Res-Care contends Iowa P & A failed to \nestablish probable cause to believe neglec11 or abuse had occurred.  Res-Care also contends Iowa \nP & A has failed to prove it contacted T's legal guardian before initiating its investigation. \nInitially, the Court feels compelled to note that the Iowa P & A representatives' attempt to \nenter the Victorian Acres facility on January 31,2002 was less than professional.  The extensive, \nintrusive nature of the representatives' request to investigate certainly carried with it the \nresponsibility to appropriately identiJy themselves, and to provide the facility with sufficient detail \nof their probable cause to access facility records. \nThat having been said, however, the Court finds defendant no longer has a legal basis on \nwhich to deny or delay access.  Congress (:nacted the PAIR program to provide protection and \nadvocacy services to certain individuals with disabilities not covered under the P ADD or P AIMl \nActs.  See 29 U.S.C. § 794e(a).  The PAIR statute further provides that an agency designated \nunder the Act shall have \"the same general authorities, including access to records and program \nincome\" as agencies designated under the P ADD Act.  Id § 794e(f)(2).  The P ADD Act provides \nin tum that the desigrrated state agency, in tlus case Iowa P & A, shall have access to the records \nof covered individuals in cases in which the individual, or the individual's legal guardian, \nconservator or other legal representative ho:s authorized the system to have such access.  42 \nU.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I)(i)-(iii).  In additior, Iowa P & A shall also have access to the individual's \nrecords if: \n(ii)  (I) the individual, by reason of such individual's mental or physical \ncondition, is unable to authorize the system to have such access; \n6 \n\n(II) the individual does not have a legal guardian, conservator, or other legal \nrepresentative, or the legal guardian of the individual is the State; and \n(III) a complaint has been received by the system about the individual with \nregard to the status ortreatment of the individual or, as a result of monitoring \nor other activities, there is probable cause to believe that such individual has \nbeen subject to abuse or neglect; and \n(Iii)  any individual with a developmental disability in a situation in which \n(I) the individual has a legal guardian, conservator, or other legal \nrepresentative; \n(II) a complaint has been received by the system about the individual \nwith regard to the status or treatment of the individual or, as a \nresult of monitoring or other activities,.there is probable cause to believe \nthat such individual has been subject to abuse and neglect; \n(ill) such representative has been contacted by such system, upon receipt \nof the name and address of such representative; \n(IV) such system has offered assistance to such representative to resolve \nthe situation; and \nM \nsuch representative hal failed or refused to act on behalf of the individual. \n42 U.S.C. § IS043(a)(2)(I)O){Iii).  Because resident T has a legal guardian empowered to make \ndecisions regarding his care, the Court finds subsection (a)(2)(I)(iii) governs Iowa P & N.s right \nof access to Ts facility records. \nWith regard to the issue of probable cause, the evidence shows that Iowa P & A received \na complaint that an individual entitled to protection under the PAIR Act was dragged outside in \nthe nIiddle of winter without his pants on by a Victorian Acres staff member, and suffered a five \ninch wound during the process.  Based on this complaint, Iowa P & A deternIined it had probable \ncause to believe the individual had been subjected to abuse or neglect.  29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(2); 42 \nU.S.C. § lS043(a)(2)(I)(ii)(III). \nIn its resistance memorandum, Res·Care contends the fact that two other agencies, DIA \nand the Veterans' Administration, fully investigated the incident and failed to find abuse prevents \nplaintiff from establishing probable cause as a matter oflaw. This Court disagrees.  First of all, \nDIA had declined to release its report of the incident to plaintiff until forced to do so by court \norder on March 12, 2002.  See Iowa Protection & Advocacy Services, Inc. v. Rasmussen, No. 4-\n02-CV-90004 (S.D. Iowa March 12, 2002} (pratt, J)'.  Secondly, probable cause determinations \n,  Local Rule 3 .1 (e) requires that parties identify on the civil cover sheet \"all related cases of \nwhich the plaintiff or the plaintiff's counsel is aware that either are pending in any Iowa state or \n7 \n\nare made by Iowa P & A exclusive of other investigative authorities.  As reasoned by Judge Pratt \nin Rasmussen: \"[p]rotection and advoca<:y systems are established as independent checks on state \ncare and regulation of care for dependent adults.  That independent check would become. \nmeaningless ifa state was allowed to simply legislate away a protection and advocacy system's \npower to investigate by enacting restrictions.\" Rasmussen, slip op. at 14-16; see also Arizona \nCtr. For Disability Law v. Allen, 197 F.R,D. 689, 693 (D. Ariz. 2000) (\"[A] P & A is the final \narbiter of probable cause for the purpose of triggering its authority to access all records for an \nindividual that may have been subject to abuse or neglect.  To conclude otherwise would frustrate \nthe purpose of the P & A laws ....\" ).  Based on the seriousness ofthe allegations contained in \nthe complaint received by Iowa P & A, the Court finds Iowa P & A likely has a sound basis for \ndetermining it has probable cause for investigating the incident. \nRes-Care also questions whether Iowa P & A appropriately contacted T's guardian as \nrequired by the statute.  Iowa P & A asserts it did contact the guardian, and received consent to \nproceed with its investigation, but that the individual desires to remain anonymous.  On March 20, \n2002, Iowa P & A submitted to this Court in camera a document entitled, \"Iowa Protection and \nAdvocacy Services, Inc. Investigative Agrl~ent for Advocacy Services, \" which is signed by T's \nguardian.  This form confinns that T's guardian was in fact the individual who initially contacted \nIowa P & A in January 2002, and that the guardian therefore had appropriate notice ofIowa P & \nA's investigation.  Absent a statutory or regulatory provision dictating the form of proof of \nnotification, the Court is satisfied Iowa P &: A has complied with section lS043(a)(2)(I)(iii) of the \nPADD statute.\" \nfederal court or were concluded in any Iowa state or federal court within the preceeding year.\" \nRecently, the Court has encountered many instances in which plaintiff's counsel have failed to list \nrelated cases.  In the event of future litigation, plaintiff's counsel is urged to list this and prior court \nactions as related cases. After evaluating potential similarities in the legal and factual issues involved, \nthe Court will make the appropriate judicial assignment. \n•  Iowa P & A argues alternatively that even if the Court finds it did not properly contact T's \nguardian, provisions contained in the P ADD Act entitle it to have immediate access to facility records \nin situations in which it detennines \"there is probable cause to believe that the health or safety oft he \n8 \n\n3.  Whether Iowa P & A is Entitled to Investigate Facility as a Whole \nIn addition to the care provided to T, Iowa P & A also seeks to investigate the care \nprovided to Victorian Acres residents as a whole.  In support of this request, Iowa P & A argues \nthat Res-Care has admitted that some typ,~ of incident involving resident T did in fact occur in \nDecember 2001.  Iowa P & A also notes that one staff member was found by Victorian Acres \nadministrators to have verbally abused residents.  That staffmember has since been tenninated, \nhowever, and there are no allegations of verbal abuse by other staff members. \nIn evaluating plaintiff's request for broad-based access, the Court acknowledges that Iowa \nP & A is the final arbiter ofa finding ofprQbable cause to initiate an investigation.  Rasmussen, \nslip op. at 14-16; Arizona Ctr. For Disability Law, 197 F.R.D. at 693.  Nevertheless, the Court \ndoes not believe that Congress intended to allow the designated PADD, PAIMI or PAIR \nagency(s) unbridled llUthority to access facility records.  Rather, a review of the legislation reveals \nthat the statutory focus of the mandated protection and advocacy services is on alleged neglect or \nabuse of specific individuals.  See 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I)(i)-(iii) (outlining procedures a \nPADD agency may use to gain access to individual records); see also 29 U.S.C. § 794e (f)(2) \n(indicating agencies empowered under PAIR shall have \"the same general authorities\" as set forth \nunder the P ADD Act). \nUnlike the situation in Gerard, ther'l is no allegation that\" other residents\" of [Victorian \nAcres] may also be in jeopardy of being abused.\" Iowa Protection and Advocacy Services v. \nGerard Treatment Programs, L.L.c., 152 P. Supp.2d 1150, 1153 (N.D. Iowa 2001); see also \nPennsylvania Protection & Advocacy, Inc. v. Royer-Greaves School for Blind, No. CIV. A. 98-\n3995, 1999 WL 179797 at *1 (ED. Pa. Mllr. 25, 1999) (protection and advocacy agency sought \nto investigate allegation of \"systemic neglect\" at school for mentally-challenged blind students) . \n• \nindividual is in serious and immediate jeopardy.\"  42 U.S.C. § IS043(a)(2)G)(ii)(I)-(II) (emphasis \nadded). Although the Court does not want to diminish the seriousness oft he allegations made against \nVictorian Acres, Iowa P & A's own delay in :filing the present complaint and request for preliminary \ninjunctive relief belie any claim that it believes T is in immediate jeopardy. \n9 \n\nThere is no evidence in the present case to suggest any abuse is ongoing, that other residents have \nbeen affected, or that the alleged mistreatment resulted from a Victorian Acres policy or \nprocedure.  Accordingly, absent evidenc(: any resident is in immediate jeopardy, the Court \ndeclines to enable Iowa P & A to bypass the resident-specific procedures set forth under section \n15043(a) of the PADD Act by initiating It broad-based investigation.  If, after reviewing T's \nrecords, Iowa P & A representatives condude they have probable cause to believe that other \ncovered individuals residing in Victorian Acres have been subject to abuse or neglect, they may \ninitiate the appropriate procedures to gain access to those records as well. \n4.  Conclusion Regarding Probable Success on the Merits \nBased on the severity of the alleglttions made in the complaint received by Iowa P & A, \nthe Court finds Iowa P & A is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim that it has probable \ncause to believe that resident T was subjected to abuse or neglect.  Nevertheless, absent evidence \nthat any particular resident is in immediate jeopardy, or that an abusive individual remains on staff \nat Victorian Acres, the Court does not believe Iowa P & A is likely to succeed on the merits of its \nrequest to obtain open access to all facility records. \nC.  Threat of Irreparable Harm to Plaintiffs \nAlthough the Court's finding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed in part on the merits \ncarries considerable weight, S & M ConstlUc/ors,lnc. v. Foley Co., 959 F.2d at 98, this finding \ndoes not eliminate the need to at least cOll:lider the remaining three Dataphase factors.  Calvin \n, \nKlein Cosmetics Corp. v. Lenox Lab., 815 F.2d at 503.  The first of the three remaining factors is \nwhether a denial of preliminary injunctive relief will  irreparably harm the plaintiff organization. \nPlaintiff contends the continued denial of access will irreparably harm its ability to comply \nwith its congressional mandate to investiga.te the report of abuse of T, an individual covered by \nplaintifl's enabling statutes.  This Court agrees, finding that although T may not be in immediate \ndanger, plaintifl's ability to protect him from future harm is further compromised with each \nadditional day it is denied access to facility records.  See also Rasmussen, slip op. at 9; \n10 \n\nGerard, 152 F. Supp. 2d at 1168-72.  As noted by the Court in Gerard: \n[W]hether or not other investigatiions have already been conducted of alleged \nabuse and neglect ... and whethe:r or not any investigation already undertaken by \n[Iowa P & A] or likely to be und(:rtaken by [Iowa P & A] has or will reveal that no \nabuse or neglect has occurred ... [Iowa P & A] is still irreparably harmed by being \nprevented from pursuing fully its right to access records ... in pursuit of its duty \nto investigate circumstances providing probable cause to believe abuse or neglect \nmay be occurring. \nGerard, 152 F. Supp. 2d at 1173 (internal citation omitted).  The Court therefore finds this factor \nweighs in favor of granting preIiminary injunctive relief. \nD.  Balance of Harms \nThe Court must also consider the balance between this harm and potential harm to others \nifreliefis granted.  Sanborn Mfg. Co., 997 F.2d at 485.  In the present case, the only potential \nharm cited by Res-Care in the event iIUunc:tive relief is granted is a breach of client confidentiality. \nThis argument is not persuasive, however, as the PAIR program requires Iowa P & A to conduct \nall investigations in a confidential manner.  Pursuant to the applicable regulations: \n(a) all personal information about individuals served by any eligible system \nunder this part, including liuts of names, addresses, photographs, and \nreconts of evaluation, must be held confidential. \n(b) The eligible system's use of information and records concerning individuals \nmust be limited only to purposes directly connected with the protection and \nadvocacy program, including program evaluation activities .... \n34 C.F.R. § 381.31 (2001).  The Court therefore concludes this factor supports the issuance of \npreliminary injunctive relief. \nE.  Whether Injunction Serves the Public Interest \nFinally, the Court must consider whether the issuance of a preliminary iIUunction andlor \ntemporary restraining order serves the public interest.  Sanborn Mfg. Co., 997 F.2d at 485.  This \nCourt finds that it does.  As noted in Rasmussen: \"The P ADD Act and the PAlMI Act set forth a \nclear federal legislative mandate for protection and advocacy systems to review independently \ncare for dependent adults by state and privately run caregivers.\"  Rasmussen, slip op. at 10.  The \nPAIR Act echoes this mandate for certain individuals with disabilities otherwise ineligible for \n11 \n\n1-,  •  \\. \nservices under the PA  DD or PAlMI Acts.  See 29 U.S.C. § 794e. Because plaintiff's ability to \nprotect T from future harm depends upon a timely investigation of the allegations at issue, the \nCourt finds granting preliminary relief is warranted. \nIll.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons outlined above, plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining \norder/preliminary injunction is granted as follows: \n1.  Defendant is immediately and temporarily enjoined from preventing or interfering with \naccess by appropriately identified Iowa P & A representatives to defendant's records. \nconcerning resident T. \n2.  As set forth above, if, after reviewing T's records, Iowa P & A representatives conclude \nthey have probable cause to believ(l that other covered individuals residing in Victorian \nAcres have been subject to abuse or neglect, they may initiate the appropriate procedures \nto gain access to those records as welL \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within ten (10) days from the date of this Order, the \nparties should jointly contact the chambers of the Honorable Ross A  Walters, Chief Magistrate \nJudge for the Southern District ofIowa, to establish an expedited briefing andlor trial schedule to \nresolve plaintiff's complaint for declarative and permanent injunctive relief. \nIT IS ORDERE?P, \nthi~y \nDated  of March, 2002. \n12 ",

September 27, \n2004 \n \n \nDefendants’ Objection To \nMotion For Permanent Injunction \n \nIntroduction \n  Plaintiffs State of Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for \nPersons With Disabilities (OPA) and James McGaughey (McGaughey), \nOPA’s executive director, seek an injunction requiring defendants Hartford \nBoard of Education (HBOE) and Superintendent of Schools Robert Henry \nto allow OPA access to HBOE’s Hartford Transitional Learning Academy \n(HTLA) without parental notice or consent for the purpose of observing \nschool activities and interviewing students and staff.  In addition, OPA \nseeks an order requiring defendants to provide OPA with a list of HTLA \nparents and their contact information, again without their knowledge or \nconsent. \n\n  During a conference with the Court on August 31, 2004, the parties \nand the Court agreed to merge proceedings on the plaintiffs’ request for a \npreliminary injunction with plaintiff’s request for a permanent injunction.  \nThe parties also agreed to jointly develop Stipulations of Fact for the \npurposes of these proceedings.  Those Stipulations have been filed by the \nplaintiff, and are referred to herein.  \n  In addition, defendants submit the attached Affidavit of Jody S. \nLefkowitz, Affidavit of Sandra Cruz-Serrano and Affidavit of Gail Johnson \nin support of this Opposition. \nSummary of the Facts \nHTLA is a public school providing a therapeutic educational program \nfor students of all grade levels who have been identified as requiring \nspecial education and related services under the auspices of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities in Education Act, 20 U.S.C. Section 1400 et \nseq. (IDEA).   HTLA’s students all have an IDEA identifying label of \n\"seriously emotionally disturbed.\"  Most HTLA students also exhibit \nchallenging behaviors.  (Fact Stipulation No.7; Lefkowitz Affidavit, paras 4 \nand 5) \nHTLA is not a residential program and does not provide any \novernight services.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para 6).  HTLA students have \nparents or other family members who are responsible for making decisions \n  2\n\nabout their schooling.  Some are in the legal custody of the Connecticut \nDepartment of Children and Families (DCF).  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para 7). \nContrary to OPA’s claim, HTLA is not a program for students who \nhave severe or chronic developmental disabilities that result in substantial \nfunctional limitations of major life activities.  Nor is HTLA is a program for \nstudents who suffer from severe or disabling traumatic brain injuries.  \nStudents who suffer from severe or chronic developmental disabilities that \nresult in substantial functional limitations of major life activities or from \nsevere or disabling traumatic brain injuries are placed in other programs \nwithin HPS or in qualified and approved outside facilities, and not at HTLA.  \n(Lefkowitz Affidavit paras 8-10). \nThe decision to place students at HTLA is made by the individual \nstudent’s Pupil Planning Team (PPT). Each student’s PPT team consists \nof the student’s parent as well as teachers, support staff and \nadministrators who are familiar with the student’s needs.  Parents are \nnotified of all PPT team meetings, and every effort is made to afford \nparents and guardians a full opportunity to attend and participate in the \ndecision making process.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para 11). \nIndividualized behavior intervention plans are developed for most \nHTLA students either before or shortly after their entry to HTLA.  These \nplans are based on an individualized functional behavior assessment of \neach student’s needs.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para 12). \n  3\n\nHPS has trained the HTLA teaching staff, as well as other special \neducation teachers who work with special education students, concerning \nthe development and implementation of behavior intervention plans.  HTLA \nstaff has also been trained to use appropriate and safe de-escalation and \nphysical management procedures with students who lose control of their \nbehavior.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit paras 13-15). \nDespite HTLA’s therapeutic environment and efforts to prevent \ndisruptive behaviors, it is sometimes necessary to seclude students whose \nbehavior is disruptive or dangerous and who cannot be immediately de-\nescalated.  Records are maintained of these seclusion incidents.  \n(Lefkowitz Affidavit para 16). \nIn addition, it is sometimes necessary to physically restrain students \nwhose behavior presents a risk of injury to themselves or others.  Again, \nrecords are maintained of each restraint incident.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para \n17).  HTLA staff are trained and instructed that physical restraint is the last \nchoice in responding to a student who loses control of his or her behavior \nand threatens injury to him or herself or others.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para \n18).  HTLA staff is also trained to use proper and safe physical restraint \nprocedures when restraint is necessary as a last resort to prevent injury.  \n(Lefkowitz Affidavit para 15). \n  4\n\nPhysical restraint is not child abuse or neglect - it is a sometimes \nnecessary means to prevent a student from injuring himself or herself or \nothers.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para 19). \nHTLA parents are informed upon admission that their children will be \nrestrained if necessary to avoid injury to the student or others.  (Fact \nStipulation Nos. 9 and 10 and Exhibits A and B).  \nHBOE has adopted a policy regarding student records in compliance \nwith the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. Section \n1232g (FERPA).  HPS does not provide notice to parents that parent \nnames or contact information will be disclosed upon request without their \nindividualized consent or that parents have the right to object to the \nrelease of such information without prior consent.  (Cruz-Serrano Affidavit \nparas 4 – 5). \n  HPS takes allegations of child abuse or neglect in all of its schools \nvery seriously.  (Johnson Affidavit para 5).  HPS’ Department of Human \nResources has received reports of alleged misconduct involving potential \nabuse or neglect of HTLA students by staff both from HTLA administration \nand from DCF, whose responsibility it is to investigate incidents of potential \nchild abuse or neglect.  (Johnson Affidavit para 6). \nHBOE’s Human Resources Department promptly investigates such \nreports of abuse or neglect.  Where DCF is involved, the Human \n  5\n\nResources Department fully cooperates with DCF in a coordinated \ninvestigation.  (Johnson Affidavit para 7). \nDCF reports the findings of its investigations of alleged abuse or \nneglect to Superintendent Henry, who shares them with the Human \nResources Department.  (Johnson Affidavit para 8).  HPS has taken and \nwill continue to take1 corrective action in any case involving an HPS or \nDCF investigation that substantiates child abuse or neglect by HPS staff in \nany school.  (Johnson Affidavit para 11). \nAt least over the past two years, DCF has not substantiated abuse \nor neglect in any incident at HTLA.  In fact, as recently as June 29, 2004, \nDCF reported that it did not substantiate abuse or neglect in a reported \nincident at HTLA.  (Johnson Affidavit paras 9 and 10). \nIn or before February 2004, Plaintiffs decided to investigate HTLA \njointly with The Office of the Child Advocate (OCA).  (Fact Stipulation No. \n15).  Plaintiff OPA and OCA sent Defendant Henry a letter dated February \n3, 2004, notifying him of the investigation.  (Fact Stipulation No. 16 and \nExhibit D). \nRepresentatives of Plaintiff OPA and OCA went to HTLA on \nFebruary 10, 2004 announcing to the school's Principal their intentions.  \n                                                 \n1  Nearly all HPS employees are members of collective bargaining units and have \nthe right to challenge disciplinary actions before a neutral arbitrator.  In addition, \nthe Teacher Tenure Act affords tenured teachers the right to a neutral hearing \npanel in all discharge cases.  (Johnson Affidavit para 11). \n  6\n\nDefendant Henry's representative, Principal Macauley, refused to allow \nPlaintiff OPA and OCA access to HTLA documents and did not allow \nPlaintiff OPA and OCA access to students at the HTLA facility for \ninterviews or observations.  (Fact Stipulation No. 17). \nPlaintiff OPA, OCA and Defendant Henry, and representatives of \neach, met on April 7, 2004 to discuss the matter.  At the meeting, \nDefendant Henry agreed to and later did provide Plaintiff and OCA with \nrequested documents that did not contain personally identifiable \ninformation derived from HTLA student records.  Defendant Henry, \nhowever, refused to provide OPA or OCA with the names, addresses and \ntelephone numbers of parents of HTLA students.  (Fact Stipulation No. 18). \nAt that meeting, Defendant Henry's representatives explained to \nplaintiff and OCA during the April 7, 2004 meeting their belief that the \nFamily Educational Right to Privacy Act [FERPA], 20 U.S.C. Section \n1232g, prevents the disclosure of student records and access to students \nfor interviews and observations, absent parent consent.  (Fact Stipulation \nNo. 19). \nDefendants' representatives and Plaintiffs' representatives \nexchanged correspondence concerning the matter during the following \nmonths, but were unable to come to a meeting of the minds.  (Fact \nStipulation No. 22 and Exhibits E, F, G, H, I and J).  This suit followed.   \n  7\n\nIn the meantime, on August 30, 2004 HPS delivered documents to \nOPA’s co-investigator, OCA, pursuant to a subpoena issued by OCA for \nHTLA secondary level student education records.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para \n20).  See Exhibit K. Included in the records that were provided were \nstudent Individualized Education Plans that identify the name of each \nstudent’s parent(s) along with address and telephone number.  Also \nincluded among the documents provided pursuant to the subpoena were \nrecords of student restraint and seclusion at HTLA.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit \npara 21). \nArgument \nA.  Standard for Issuing Permanent Injunction \nOPA’s burden here is to establish “the absence of an adequate \nremedy at law and irreparable harm if the relief is not granted” and that the \nbalance of equities tips in favor of the moving party.  N.Y. State Nat’l Org \nfor Women v. Terry, 886 F.2d 1339, 1362 (2d Cir. 1989); Sierra Club v. \nHennessey, 695 F.2d 643, 647 (2d Cir. 1982).  In addition, because it is \nseeking a permanent injunction, OPA must show actual success on the \nmerits of its claims.  Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, \n546 n. 12 (1987).  \nB.  OPA Cannot Establish Success On the Merits \n \n1.  FERPA and IDEA Prohibit The Requested Access  \n  8\n\nTwo federal statutes, the Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act, \n20 U.S.C. Section 1232g (FERPA) and the Individuals with Disabilities in \nEducation Act, 20 U.S.C. Section 1400 et seq (IDEA) prohibit public school \nsystems from providing the information and the access requested by OPA \nwithout individualized and specific parent2 consent. \nFERPA broadly mandates that educational institutions receiving \nfederal funding must implement a strictly defined policy to maintain the \nconfidentiality of “education records” and “information contained therein.”  \nWith exceptions that do not apply here3, schools may allow disclosure only \nwith specific parent consent. \nFERPA provides, in part: \nNo funds shall be made available under any applicable \nprogram to any educational agency or institution which has a \npolicy or practice of permitting the release of educational \nrecords (or personally identifiable information contained \ntherein other than directory information, as defined in \nparagraph (5) of subsection (a)) of students without the written \nconsent of their parents to any individual, agency, or \norganization, other than to the following . . .” \n \n20 U.S.C. Section 1232g(b). \n                                                 \n2  For ease of discussion, the term “parent” consent is intended to include also \nthe consent of a student’s legal guardian or an adult student.  \n3  FERPA allows disclosure without parental consent to school officials with an \neducational need for the information, school systems to which the student seeks \nto enroll, and the state education department for compliance purposes, among \nother things.  20 U.S.C. Section 1232g(b)(A) through (J).  None of those \nexceptions applies in this case, however.  \n  9\n\n“Directory Information” is defined in paragraph (5) of subsection (a) \nas follows: \n(A)  For the purpose of this section the term “directory information” \nrelating to a student includes the following:  the student’s name, \naddress, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of \nstudy, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, \nweight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of \nattendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent \nprevious educational agency or institution attended by the student. \n(B)  Any educational agency or institution making public directory \ninformation shall give public notice of the categories of information \nwhich has designated as such information with respect to each \nstudent attending the institution or agency and shall allow a \nreasonable period of time after such notice has been given for a \nparent to inform the institution or agency that any or all of the \ninformation designated should not be released without the parent’s \nprior consent. \n \n“Education records” are defined broadly: \n[T]hose records, files, documents and other materials which \n(i)  contain information directly related to a student; and \n(ii)  are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a \nperson acting for such agency or institution \n \n20 U.S.C. Section 1232g(a)(4)(A). \n“Personally identifiable information” is defined in the FERPA \nimplementing regulations as follows: \nPersonally identifiable information includes, but is not limited \nto: \n(a)   The student’s name; \n(b)   The name of the student’s parent or other family \nmember; \n(c)     The address of the student or the student’s family; \n(d)  A personal identifier, such as the student’s social \nsecurity number or student number; \n  10\n\n(e)  A list of personal characteristics that would make the \nstudent’s identity easily traceable; or \n(f)  Other information that would make the student’s identity \neasily traceable. \n \n34 C.F.R. Section 99.3. \n \n  HBOE has not notified parents, as FERPA would require for \ndisclosure of “directory information,” that their names or contact \ninformation is subject to disclosure without consent4.  (Cruz-Serrano \nAffidavit para 5).   \nIDEA also mandates that the Secretary of Education “in accordance \nwith the provisions of [FERPA] . . . assure the protection of the \nconfidentiality of any personally identifiable data, information, and records \ncollected or maintained by . . . local educational agencies pursuant to” . . . \nIDEA.  20 U.S.C. Section 1417(c). \n  The OPA’s request for the names and contact information of HTLA \nparents as well its request for access to HTLA for interviews and \nobservations of students and staff run afoul of the mandates of FERPA \nand IDEA.  It is beyond dispute that the names and addresses and \ntelephone numbers of HTLA students’ parents constitutes “personally \nidentifiable” information concerning students that is contained in their \n“education records.”  Even if HPS could legally disclose this information as \n                                                 \n4  Section 1232g(a)(5) defining “directory information” suggests that an \neducational institution may not legally designate parent names and addresses as \n“directory information” subject to disclosure without specific consent.   \n  11\n\n“directory information,” it has not provided the mandatory notice to parents \nof its intention to do so and therefore may not disclose the information \nwithout parental consent. \n  In addition, the access that OPA requests to the HTLA school \nbuilding for the purpose of observing and interviewing students and staff \nnecessarily will involve disclosure of “personally identifiable” information \ncontained in the students’ education records at the least because all of the \nstudents at HTLA are identified as requiring special education or related \nservices under IDEA - a “personally identifiable” fact contained in their \neducation records.  Without question, any observation or interview of \nstudents or staff will also reveal or disclose student names or other \npersonal characteristics that would make the students easily traceable.   \nNecessarily, such access would also reveal the students’ specific \nspecial education identification as “seriously emotionally disturbed” since \nall HTLA students fall within this category.  In all likelihood, such access \nwould also involve disclosure of the students’ specific special education \nprograms, including for instance provisions for therapeutic services, \nlanguage services and individual behavior intervention plans.5  Information \nreflected in the various evaluations and assessments of HTLA students’ \nacademic, cognitive and emotional strengths and weaknesses would likely \n                                                 \n5  Indeed, from OPA’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction, it appears that OPA is particularly interested in the students’ individual \nbehavior intervention plans.  (Plaintiff’s Memorandum, p. 6). \n  12\n\nbe revealed through such interviews.  The requested interviews would also \nlikely involve disclosure of students’ academic achievement and \ndisciplinary history.   \n  All of this information – likely to be revealed through the requested \naccess – is personally identifiable information contained in students’ \neducation records and is protected from disclosure without parental \nconsent under FERPA and IDEA.   \n  Superintendent Henry made these facts clear to OPA and its co-\ninvestigator OCA both during their meeting on April 7, 2004 and in \nsubsequent correspondence.  (Fact Stipulation No. 21 and Exhibits E, F, \nG, H, I and J) \n2.  OPA’s Statutory Jurisdiction Does Not Encompass The \nRequested Access Or Override FERPA and IDEA \nMandates \n \nOPA argues that its federal authorizing statutes, the DD, PAIMI and \nPAIR Acts6 (OPA Acts) permit the access it seeks and “trump” FERPA and \nIDEA.  Both aspects of this argument are incorrect.  None of the OPA Acts \nauthorize the requested access in this case, and even if they did, FERPA \nand IDEA clearly take precedence.7   \n                                                 \n6  42 U.S.C. Sections 15041 et seq (DD Act); 42 U.S.C. Sections 10801 et seq \n(PAIMI Act); 29 U.S.C. Section 794e (PAIR Act). \n7   Plaintiffs also seem to concede FERPA’s and IDEA’s role in their request \nwhen they argue that they will use parent names to obtain individualized consent \nfor access to student records.  See Plaintiff’s Memorandum, p. 10.  The \n  13\n\n  OPA’s claim that the OPA Acts override or “trump” FERPA and IDEA \nessentially argues that the OPA Acts work a repeal by implication of \nFERPA and IDEA.  The law is clear that when two federal statutes appear \nin conflict, the courts will only rarely find such a repeal by implication: \n[T]he only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is \nwhen the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.  \n \nMorton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550 (1974). \n \nThe rarity with which [the Court] has discovered implied \nrepeals is due to the relatively stringent standard for such \nfindings, namely, that there be an irreconcilable conflict \nbetween the two federal statutes at issue.”   \n \nMatsushita Elect. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U.S. 367, 381 \n(1996). \n \n  This is not an appropriate case for implied repeal because the \nvarious federal statutes can be harmonized.  As discussed below, the OPA \nActs simply do not authorize the sweeping demands of OPA in this case. \n  It is instructive and significant that, according to OPA’s papers8 and \nas far as defendants have been able to ascertain, the only court in the \nUnited States to address the precise issue presented here – whether the \nOPA is allowed access to personally identifiable information contained in \npublic school education records without parental consent – has decided \nthat OPA is not allowed such access. \n                                                                                                                                                 \nargument is circular, however, because the parent names are also protected \ninformation under FERPA and IDEA. \n8  Plaintiff’s Memorandum, p. 20. \n  14\n\n  In Washington Protection and Advocacy System, Inc. v. Evergreen \nSchool District, C03-5062 FDB (W.Wash 2003) (attached), the district \ncourt denied the Washington OPA’s request for a preliminary injunction \nseeking student names and parent names and contact information for \nthose participating in a special education program operated by the \nEvergreen public school district.  As here, the Washington OPA claimed \nthat it had probable cause to suspect abuse or neglect in the program \nbased on complaints about a student’s special education program.   \n  The Washington court denied the requested injunction in a \nthoughtful opinion noting, among other things, that the court “is not \nsufficiently satisfied that the [OPA Acts] override FERPA and IDEA.”  (Id. at \np. 4).  The Court went on to find that the OPA had not demonstrated \nsufficient probable cause to believe that the school system was abusing or \nneglecting any student and that disclosure of contact information for all \nstudents in the special education program was not warranted.  (Id. at p. 5 \nand 6.) \nThe Washington court relied in part on staff comments conceding \nthat the DD Act does not supercede FERPA in a discussion of proposed \nimplementing regulations: \nComments:  several commenters requested including \nregulations to indicate that the provisions regarding access of \nrecords under the Developmental Disabilities Act and \nregulations take precedence over other Federal statutes and \nregulations.  If that was not possible, commenters wanted \n  15\n\nlanguage to specifically reference the Federal Education \nRights and Privacy Act (FERPA) which sets out certain \nrestrictions on the release of records by educational \ninstitutions (20 U.S.C. 1232(g)) [sic]; 34 CFR part 99 \nResponse:  We did not include such a provision because such \na requirement goes beyond the authority of the Developmental \nDisabilities Act and these regulations.  However, we have \nincluded language comparable to the PAIMI provisions at \nSection 1386.22(i) on Delay or Denial of Access.  If a system \nis denied access to facilities and its programs, individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities, or records covered by the Act or \nthese regulations, it shall be provided promptly with a written \nstatement of reasons, including, in the case of a denial for \nalleged lack of authorization, the name and address of the \nlegal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative of an \nindividual with developmental disabilities.9\n \n61 FR 51142-01 \n \n  The only other court to approach addressing the issue was the \ndistrict court in Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service, Inc. v. Miller, \n849 F.Supp. 1202 (W.D.Mich 1994).  There, the Michigan OPA sought \naccess to residential facilities for developmentally disabled and mentally ill \nindividuals operated by the Michigan Department of Social Services.  \nAlthough the Michigan OPA was not, as here, seeking information \ncontained in education records, but instead access to individuals in a \nresidential program, the district court held that such access was not barred \nby IDEA.   \n                                                 \n9  The regulations to which staff refer do not purport to require public school \nsystems to disclose the names or addresses of parents.  See discussion at p. 28-\n29 below. \n  16\n\nNoting that “Section 1232g(b) [FERPA] does prohibit federal funding \nto educational institutions which permit the release of records without \nparental consent,” the court held that the DD and PAIMI Acts authorized \nthe OPA access to the state facility.  Michigan Protection & Advocacy \nServices Inc. v. Miller, 849 F.Supp. 1202, 1208 (W.D. Mich. 1994).   \n  The Miller case is readily distinguishable from this situation because \nthe facilities involved were residential programs, not educational \ninstitutions.  The request apparently did not even implicate education \nrecords or personally identifiable information contained in education \nrecords governed by FERPA or IDEA, but instead sought access to \nindividuals in residential programs.  Moreover, and unlike HTLA, the \nresidential facilities there housed individuals with developmental \ndisabilities.10   \n3.  The DD Act Does Not Apply To HTLA Students \n  The DD Act would not authorize OPA’s requested access to the \nHTLA students or information concerning their parents even if there was \nprobable cause to suspect abuse or neglect because HTLA students are \n                                                 \n10  The DD Act, as discussed more fully below, does not apply to HTLA’s \nstudents because they do not suffer from developmental disabilities as defined \nthere.  Unlike the PAIMI Act, which addresses individuals with mental illness and \narguably does apply to HTLA students, the DD Act authorizes broader \ninvestigatory “access” to clients without parental or guardian consent.  See \ndiscussion at page 23 below. \n  17\n\nnot developmentally disabled as defined in the Act.  The DD Act, at 42 \nU.S.C. Section 15043(a)(2) authorizes the OPA to: \n(B)  investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals \nwith developmental disabilities if the incidents are reported to \nthe system or if there is probable cause to believe that the \nincidents occurred.  \n \n42 U.S.C. Section 15043(a)(2)(emphasis added). \n \n  The DD Act further authorizes OPA to: \n(H)  have access at reasonable times to any individual with a \ndevelopmental disability in a location in which services, \nsupports, and other assistance are provided to such an \nindividual, in order to carry out the purpose of this part; \n \n(I)  have access to all records of –  \n(i) any individual with a developmental disability who is \na client of the system [with consent of client or \nguardian]; \n(ii) any individual with a developmental disability [if \nindividual cannot consent and does not have a \nguardian and a complaint has been received or there \nis probable cause to suspect abuse or neglect];  \n(iii) any individual with a developmental disability [if \nguardian fails or refuses consent and there is a \ncomplaint or probable cause to suspect abuse or \nneglect after the OPA offers assistance].  \n \n42 U.S.C. Section 15043(a)(2)(emphasis added). \n \n“Developmental disability” is defined by the DD Act as follows: \n(A)  In general.  The term “developmental disability” means \na severe, chronic disability of an individual that –  \n(i)  is attributable to a mental or physical impairment \nor combination of mental and physical \nimpairments; \n(ii)  is manifested before the individual attains age 22 \n(iii)  is likely to continue indefinitely; \n  18\n\n(iv)  results in substantial functional limitations in 3 or \nmore of the following areas of major life activity: \n(J)  Self-care. \n(K)  Receptive and expressive language. \n(L)  Learning. \n(M)  Mobility. \n(N)  Self-direction. \n(O)  Capacity of independent living. \n(P)  Economic self-sufficiency; and \n(v)  reflects the individual’s need for a combination \nand sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or \ngeneric services, individualized supports, or other \nforms of assistance that are of lifelong or \nextended duration and are individually planned \nand coordinated. \n \nAs the Lefkowitz Affidavit establishes, the HTLA students are not \nindividuals with developmental disabilities or traumatic brain injuries as \ndefined by the DD Act.  Students who do have developmental disabilities \nare provided services at sites other than HTLA.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit paras \n8 - 10).  \nAccordingly, the DD Act simply would not authorize OPA access to \neither HTLA students or their records even if other required conditions for \naccess were met.   \n4.  The PAIMI Act Does Not Authorize the Requested \nAccess \n \n  19\n\nThe PAIMI Act, upon which OPA also relies, comes closer to \ncovering HTLA students11, but provides narrower investigatory power than \nthe DD Act, and clearly does not authorize the access requested here.   \n                                                 \n11  Although their qualifying identification is “seriously emotionally disturbed” \nwhich carries a different definition under IDEA than the PAIMI Act’s definition of \n“mental illness,” most HTLA students probably qualify as individuals with mental \nillness for PAIMI’s purposes. \n  20\n\nThe PAIMI Act authorizes OPA to: \n(1)(A) investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with \nmental illness if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is \nprobable cause to believe that the incidents occurred; \n. . . \n(3)  have access to facilities in the State providing care or \ntreatment; \n \n(4)  in accordance with section 10806 of this title, have access to \nall records of –  \n(A) any individual who is a client of the system if such \nindividual, or the legal guardian, conservator, or other legal \nrepresentative of such individual, has authorized the \nsystem to have such access; \n(B) any individual . . . –  \n(i) who by reason of the mental or physical condition of \nsuch individual is unable to authorize the system to have \nsuch access; \n(ii) who does not have a legal guardian, conservator, or \nother legal representative, or for whom the legal guardian \nis the State; and \n(iii) with respect to whom a complaint has been received by \nthe system or with respect to whom as a result of \nmonitoring or other activities (either of which result from a \ncomplaint or other evidence) there is probable cause to \nbelieve that such individual has been subject to abuse or \nneglect; and \n(C) any individual with a mental illness, who has a legal \nguardian, conservator, or other legal representative, with \nrespect to whom a complaint has been received by the \nsystem or with respect to whom there is probable cause to \nbelieve the health or safety of the individual is in serious \nand immediate jeopardy, whenever –  \n(i) such representative has been contacted by such system \nupon receipt of the name and address of such \nrepresentative; \n(ii) such system has offered assistance to such \nrepresentative to resolve the situation; and \n(iii) such representative has failed or refused to act on \nbehalf of the individual. \n \n42 U.S.C. Section 10805(a)(emphasis added). \n  21\n\n \nOPA’s implementing regulations define “facility” for the purpose of \nSection 10805(a)(3)’s provision for “access to facilities in the State” as \nfollows:   \nFacility includes any public or private residential setting that \nprovides overnight care accompanied by treatment services.  \nFacilities include, but are not limited to the following:  general \nand psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, board and care \nhomes, community housing, juvenile detention facilities, \nhomeless shelters, and jails and prisons, including all general \nareas as well as special mental health or forensic units. \n \n42 C.F.R. Section 51.2 \nA review of the law makes plain that OPA is not authorized to have \nthe requested access.  First, OPA may not have access to the HTLA \nfacility because HTLA clearly is not a “facility” for the purposes of Section \n10805(a)(3) - HTLA is not a residential setting and does not provide \novernight care.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para 6).   \n  Second, OPA may not have parent name or contact information for \nany individual student under subpart (A) of Section 10805(4) because OPA \nhas not produced authorization for disclosure of such record information \nfrom any OPA client. \n  Third, OPA may not have the name or contact information for any \nindividual HTLA student under subpart (B) of Section 10805(4) because \nHTLA students have parents or others who are authorized to make \ndecisions about their schooling.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para 7). \n  22\n\n  Fourth, OPA may not have the name or contact information for any \nindividual HTLA parent under subpart (C) Section 10805(4) because it has \nnot demonstrated that it has received a complaint with respect to any \nindividual student and has not claimed or demonstrated that the health or \nsafety of such individual student is “in serious and immediate jeopardy”12 \nand has not demonstrated that it has contacted such student’s \nrepresentative, offered assistance, and that such representative has failed \nto act. \n  Finally, OPA may not have the parent name or contact information \nfor HTLA students in general because Section 10805(a)(4) manifestly does \nnot authorize disclosure in the face of generalized complaints or probable \ncause that are not specific to particular individuals.  Each subpart of \nSection 10805(a)(4) makes reference to complaints regarding individuals \nand probable cause concerning individuals.  The Act contains no provision \nfor generalized access to records or the confidential information contained \nin them.  \n  In summary, like the DD Act, the PAIMI Act simply does not \nauthorize the access or disclosure that OPA seeks here.  Even if the \nevidence supported OPA’s claim that it has probable cause to suspect that \n                                                 \n12  OPA’s claim that some students have been injured during restraint, or have \nbeen secluded inappropriately or do not have individual behavior intervention \nplans is a far cry from evidence of serious and immediate jeopardy to safety or \nhealth. \n  23\n\nHTLA students are being subject to abuse or neglect, OPA’s investigatory \nauthority does not extend so far as it claims.  \nSignificantly, Congress has provided more limited investigatory \npowers under the PAIMI Act than under the DD Act.  While investigators \nunder the DD Act may have access to any “location in which services, \nsupports, and other assistance are provided,” (42 U.S.C. 15043(a)(2)) the \nPAIMI Act limits such access to “residential setting[s] that provide \novernight care . . .”  (42 C.F.R. Section 51.2).  In addition, the PAIMI Act \nlimits access to records without consent and where there is a guardian \nwho does not cooperate to situations in which there is a threat that the \n“health or safety of the individual is in serious and immediate jeopardy.”  \n(42 U.S.C. Section 10805(a)(4)(c)).   \n5.  The PAIR Act Does Not Authorize The Requested \nAccess \n \nOPA’s final claim to authority is based on the PAIR Act.  The Pair \nAct is a funding statute for OPA to provide services for individuals with a \nbroader range of disabilities than those identified under the DD Act or the \nPAIMI Act.  It manifestly does not mandate access to confidential \neducation records or the information contained in them for such \nindividuals.  \n  24\n\n6.  HTLA Students Are Not Subject To Abuse or Neglect  \n \n  OPA’s investigatory powers under each of the OPA Acts hinges on \nthe existence of probable cause to believe that an individual is being \nsubjected to abuse or neglect.  Here, the claim is based on the allegation \nthat some HTLA students and parents have reported inappropriate \nphysical restraint or seclusion and that some students have claimed \nphysical injury as a result of restraint.  In addition, OPA makes the \nunsupported allegation that HTLA students have not been adequately \nassessed before entering HTLA and/or that they are not provided with \nindividualized behavior intervention plans. \n  Defendants dispute the factual assumptions underlying all of these \narguments.  While it is true that some HTLA students have been physically \nrestrained and/or secluded, there is no evidence that these steps were \ntaken inappropriately.  To the contrary, the investigations that have been \nconducted by DCF, a state agency charged with the responsibility to \ninvestigate reports of abuse or neglect, indicate otherwise.  DCF has not \nsubstantiated abuse or neglect at HTLA in at least two years.  (Johnson \nAffidavit para 9). \n  It goes without saying that HPS takes allegations of alleged abuse or \nneglect very seriously.  Although there have been no recent substantiated \ncases at HTLA, HPS certainly would take corrective action with any \nemployee involved in such an incident.  (Johnson Affidavit 11). \n  25\n\nNor can an inference be drawn that the mere existence of a restraint \nor seclusion constitutes abuse or neglect.  Restraint procedures are \nsometimes necessary - as a last resort - to prevent injury.  Seclusion is \nsometimes necessary to remove a child whose behavior is disruptive or \ndangerous and cannot be de-escalated.  HTLA parents acknowledge that \nrestraint may be necessary for their child upon admission to the program.  \n(Lefkowitz Affidavit paras 16 – 19; Stipulation of Fact Nos. 9 and 10 and \nExhibits A and B). \n  HTLA staff is trained in physical management and de-escalation \nprocedures, as well as appropriate measures for physical restraint.  \nRecords are maintained of each incident of restraint or seclusion.  This is \nnot abuse or neglect.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit paras 13-15 and 18 and 19). \n  In addition, the unsubstantiated claim that students are placed at \nHTLA without adequate evidence or assessment of their needs is belied by \nthe facts.  Each student’s placement at HTLA is determined by a team \nconsisting of the student’s parent and school staff who are knowledgeable \nabout the student’s needs.  Parents are afforded every opportunity to \nparticipate in placement decisions.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para 11). \n  Finally, the majority of HTLA students do have individualized \nbehavior intervention plans.  These plans are based on a functional \nbehavioral assessment of that student’s needs.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para \n12).  Thus, although all HTLA students are expected to comply with certain \n  26\n\nminimum standards of conduct (Exhibit C), their behavior intervention \nplans are individualized.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit para 12). \n  The evidence presented by OPA does not rise to the level of \nprobable cause to suspect “abuse” or “neglect” as defined in the PAIMI or \nDD Acts.13  Although HTLA students have been restrained and some have \nclaimed minor injury, this does not establish either abuse or neglect - \nrestraint is sometimes necessary precisely in order to prevent injury!  Nor \nwould the absence of behavior intervention plans or adequate \nassessments legally constitute or abuse or neglect, should they be proven.     \n  Moreover, even if OPA had demonstrated that an individual HTLA \nstudent was subjected to abuse or neglect, this would not establish a \ngeneralized “probable cause” as to the entire school.  Both the PAIMI and \nDD Acts speak only of probable cause to access records of individuals, not \ngroups.  Indeed, the decisions cited by OPA in support of a generalized \naccess to information stand for just the opposite.  In Pennsylvania \nProtection and Advocacy, Inc. v. Royer-Greaves School for the Blind, 1999 \nWL 179797 (E.D.Pa 1999), the court held that alleged general complaints \n                                                 \n13 The definition of “abuse” is “any act or failure to act which was performed or \nwhich was failed to be performed, knowingly, recklessly, or intentionally, and \nwhich caused or may have caused, injury or death to an individual . . . .”  42 \nC.F.R Section 51.2 (PAIMI Act); 45 C.F.R. Section 1386.10 (DD Act).  The \ndefinition of “neglect” is “a negligent act or omission by an individual responsible \nfor providing treatment or habilitation services which caused or may have caused \ninjury or death to an individual . . . or which placed an individual . . at risk of injury \nor death.”  (Id.) \n  27\n\nof unsafe conditions did not constitute sufficient individualized probable \ncause for release of individual records)14.   \nIn Georgia Advocacy Office v. Borison, 520 S.E. 2d 701 (1999), the \ncourt held that an allegation that physicians conducted a fraudulent drug \nstudy was sufficient to support access only to records of particular study \nparticipates who fit within the OPA Act’s guidelines and who were subject \nto abuse or neglect.  There, the court ordered the trial court to identify such \nindividuals through an in camera review of the drug study records, and did \nnot allow plaintiffs access to all records.  Georgia Advocacy Office v. \nBorison, 520 S.E. 2d 701, 784 (1999). \n7.  OPA Has No Authority To Access Parent Names Or \nContact Information \n \n  OPA’s claimed right to parent “directory information” is also beyond \nits authority.  Ironically, the term “directory information” comes only from \nFERPA, which manifestly does not include parent names or contact \ninformation in its definition of that term.  20 U.S.C. Section 1232g(a)(5)(A).  \nWashington Protection and Advocacy System, Inc. v. Evergreen School \nDistrict, C03-5062 FDB (W.Wash 2003) (attached), p. 5 (parent names and \ncontact information is not “directory information” under FERPA.)   \n                                                 \n14  Although the Royer-Greaves case also directed the defendant to provide a list \nof all guardians and contact information under the DD Act and its regulations, \nthat portion of the decision is not applicable here.  OPA is not entitled to parents \nnames or addresses under the similar provisions of the PAIMI Act.  See \ndiscussion at pages 28-29 below.  \n  28\n\nMoreover, even if it could, HBOE does not notify parents that their \nnames or contact information will be disclosed without consent or provide \nan opportunity to prevent such disclosure.  (Cruz-Serrano Affidavit  para \n6).  Without such notice, HBOE may not disclose even directory \ninformation. \nNone of the OPA Acts mentions “directory information” or directs that \nsuch information be disclosed to OPA.  Nor do any of the OPA Acts make \nany provision for disclosure of parent names or contact information.   \nThe PAIMI Act’s regulations do state that “the P&A system shall be \nprovided promptly with . . . in the case of a denial [of access to facilities or \nrecords covered by the Act] for alleged lack of authorization, the name, \naddress and telephone number of the legal guardian, conservator, or other \nlegal representative of an individual with mental illness.”  C.F.R. Section \n51.43.  This regulation, however, has no application here because the \naccess requested is not authorized under the Act, as discussed above.   \nIn addition, as a general matter, HTLA parents are not the “legal \nguardian, conservator, or other legal representative of an individual with \nmental illness” as that term is defined in the regulations.15  Most HTLA \nstudents live with parents or other family members.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit \n                                                 \n15  42 CFR Section 51.2 states: “[L]egal guardian, conservator, and legal \nrepresentative all mean an individual whose appointment is made and regularly \nreviewed by a State court or agency empowered under State law to appoint and \nreview such officers, and having authority to consent to health/mental health care \nor treatment of an individual with mental illness. . . .” \n  29\n\npara 7).  For the remainder, OPA is free to seek consent from DCF for \nthose students who are in the custody of DCF. \nThe PAIMI regulations clearly contemplate disclosure under \nsituations that are very different than presented here – where individuals \nwith mental illness are resident in institutions, have been determined to be \nincompetent and are under the guardianship of court appointed \nconservators or similar representatives.  Unlike HTLA students who go \nhome to families every day, the individuals contemplated by the \nregulations are at the mercy of their conservators because they cannot \nhelp themselves and are isolated from family, community and advocates \nlike OPA.   \nHTLA students do not have “guardians” as contemplated in the \nregulation.  They are children in the custody of their parents or other family \nmembers.  They are not incompetent. They are not isolated.  They are not \nhelpless or at the mercy of “guardians.”  Section 51.43 surely was not \nintended to address the situation of the HTLA students who have access to \nmany resources, including advocates like OPA, to address potential \nincidents of abuse or neglect.   \n  C.  Adequate Legal Remedies Are Available; No Irreparable Injury\n  Even if OPA could establish success on the merits of its claims, it \ncannot demonstrate the irreparable injury or the absence of an adequate \nremedy at law to protect students from abuse or neglect.  Connecticut’s \n  30\n\nchild abuse and neglect laws, IDEA and other protections are available to \nprotect students from alleged abuse and neglect.   \n  Significantly, and unlike the severely disabled people who are \nisolated in residential treatment facilities for the mentally ill or \ndevelopmentally disabled, the HTLA students are neither incompetent nor \nisolated.  They go home every day to their parents and families.  The \nstudents and their parents have access to community resources, like the \nOPA, the Hartford Police department and lawyers and advocates who can \nand will protect their interests.  \n  The HTLA students and their parents have a broad array of \nremedies available to them in the event that they are abused or neglected. \nThey can pursue criminal remedies for assault.  See C.G.S. Section 53a-\n59 (criminal assault).  They can sue the school district for negligence.  See \nPurzycki v. Town of Fairfield, 244 Conn. 101 (1998)(negligence action \nagainst school system).  They can file a complaint with the Connecticut \nDepartment of Education to enforce the education laws.  See C.G.S. \nSection 10-4b.  \n  In addition, IDEA provides comprehensive procedural and \nsubstantive protections for special education students.  See 20 U.S.C \nSection 1400 et. seq.  The procedural safeguards available under IDEA \ninclude the right to examine records, the right to an impartial hearing to \ndetermine whether a student’s program is being implemented appropriately \n  31\n\nor whether independent evaluations are necessary, the right to appeal, and \nthe right to file a complaint with the United States Department of education.  \nNotably, attorneys’ fees are also available to the prevailing party in \nadministrative and litigation matters brought under IDEA.  20 U.S.C. \nSection 1415. \nThe United States Department of Education has implemented an \nextensive network of regulations to enforce IDEA.  34 C.F.R. Part 300.  \nState law also protects special education students (C.G.S Section 10-76a  \net seq) and sets forth an administrative procedure for review of complaints \nregarding special education programs.  C.G.S. Section 10-76h. \n  Any parent of an HTLA student who believes that the student’s \nprogram or placement at HTLA is not appropriate or is not based on \nsufficient evaluative data or is not being implemented correctly, may \npursue adequate administrative remedies under IDEA.  Any claim that a \nstudent has been inappropriately restrained or secluded may be addressed \nand remedied through the IDEA procedures.  If a student requires an \nindividualized behavior intervention plan and one has not been provided, \nthe parent may pursue IDEA remedies.  If a student has not been \nadequately assessed before placement at HTLA, the parent may pursue \nIDEA remedies.   \n  In addition, Connecticut state law establishes a strict mechanism for \ninvestigating and remedying incidents of child abuse and neglect in, \n  32\n\namong other places, public schools.  C.G.S. Section 17a-101 et seq.  \nNearly all public school employees are mandated to report suspected child \nabuse or neglect to DCF.  Id.  Students, parents or others who suspect \nabuse or neglect are also free to report incidents to DCF.  Penalties are \nimposed for failure of mandated reporters to report suspected abuse, and \nemployers are prohibited from discriminating against those who make \nreports.  C.G.S Section 17a-101a and 101e.   \nDCF, in turn, is mandated to investigate such reports within thirty \ndays and, in the case of an incident involving a public school system, to \nreport its findings to the Superintendent of Schools.  C.G.S. Section 17a-\n101i.   \n  As the Affidavit of Gail Johnson establishes, HPS takes reports of \nchild abuse or neglect seriously, investigating all incidents and taking \nappropriate corrective action with involved employees.  HPS coordinates \nits investigations with DCF and receives completed DCF investigation \nreports.  Although DCF has investigated reports of abuse or neglect at \nHTLA, its investigations have not substantiated abuse or neglect.  \n(Johnson Affidavit paras 5 - 8).  If DCF’s investigation or HPS’ own \ninvestigation had substantiated abuse or neglect, appropriate corrective \naction would have been taken.  (Johnson Affidavit para 11).  \n  In short, there are an abundance of legal remedies available to \naddress incidents of abuse or neglect of HTLA students that do not require \n  33\n\nthe unauthorized disclosure of education records or information contained \nin them.  OPA certainly has every right to pursue any of these remedies on \nbehalf of its clients.  \n  OPA’s focus on impediments to carrying out its own responsibilities \nas an OPA as “irreparable injury” misses the point.  The only injury or harm \nthat could stem from abuse or neglect of HTLA students is injury to the \nstudents themselves, not to OPA.  Indeed, OPA recognizes this fact when \nit argues that the OPA Acts are “civil rights laws.”  (Plaintiff’s \nMemorandum, p. 12).  If the OPA Acts are civil rights laws, they are laws \nprotecting the civil rights of the students, not the agency.   \nIn light of the multitude of available remedies to correct incidents of \nabuse or neglect at HTLA, OPA cannot establish either irreparable injury or \nthe absence of available legal remedies in support of its claim for injunctive \nrelief. \nD.  OPA Has Access To Parents Through OCA Subpoena\n \n  Significantly, OPA already has the names and contact information \nfor HTLA’s secondary16 parents as a result of defendant Henry’s \ncompliance with a recent subpoena issued by OPA’s co-investigator, the \nOffice of the Child Advocate.  (Lefkowitz Affidavit paras 20 and 21).  \n                                                 \n16  HTLA serves students in all school grades.  OCA’s recent subpoena sought \nrecords only related to its secondary level students. \n  34\n\nAlthough OCA has not served a subpoena for records relating to HTLA’s \nprimary grade parents, nothing prevents it from doing so.   \n  OPA and OCA are free to contact HTLA parents using the \ninformation provided in the subpoenaed documents to obtain access to \nstudents for the purposes of the interviews they seek.  OPA’s effort here to \nundermine the rights of the HTLA parents to control access to their \nchildren and their education records is inappropriate and unnecessary.  \nParents do and should have the right to disclose or not disclose \nconfidential information concerning their children.  OPA should not be \npermitted to shut parents out of the process. \nE.  The Requested Access Would Disrupt HTLA Operations And \nDeny Parental Rights\n \n  The Court should also consider the tremendously disruptive impact \non HTLA’s educational operation that granting OPA’s request would bring.  \nNot only would the access take valuable time away from instruction - \nHTLA’s important mission - but would inevitably undermine parent and \nstudent confidence in HTLA’s effectiveness and credibility.   \n  Students and parents would certainly be confused, and might \ninterpret the process as implying that their teachers, therapists and \nadministrators have done something wrong or inappropriate.  HTLA’s \neffectiveness would be undermined, to the detriment of the very students \nthat OPA seeks to protect.  \n  35\n\n  OPA’s request also ignores the legitimate and important interest of \nparents to control access to their children and their confidential \ninformation.  Indeed, OPA’s demand is for access without notice to parents \nand even over parent objection!  As the public policy underlying FERPA \nmakes clear, parents have the right to control who knows what about their \nchildren, at least in the public schools.  \n  In the absence of impropriety at HTLA and in light of the many other \nprivate and government watchdogs with responsibility for ensuring HTLA’s \ncompliance with laws and regulations, the balance of hardships weighs \nheavily against allowing the disruption and violation of parental rights that \nOPA’s request would entail.  Sierra Club v. Hennessey, 695 F.2d 643, 647 \n(2d Cir. 1982).   \n  36\n\nConclusion \n  For all of the foregoing reasons, defendants respectfully request that \nthe Court deny the requested injunction. \nDEFENDANTS HARTFORD \nBOARD OF EDUCATION AND \nROBERT HENRY \n \n \nBy:______________________ \nJohn Rose, Jr.  \nFederal Bar.

Lefkowitz \n \n1.  I am Senior Director for Exceptional Children for the Hartford \nPublic Schools (HPS). \n2.  I am over the age of eighteen and believe in the obligation of \nthe oath. \n3.  My responsibilities include supervision of HPS’ Special \nEducation Department. \n4.  The Hartford Transitional Learning Academy (HTLA) houses \none of HPS’ programs for students in all grades who have been identified \nas requiring Special Education or Related Services pursuant to the \nIndividuals with Disabilities in Education Act, 20 U.S.C. Section 1400 et \nseq. \n\n5.  HTLA is a program for students who are identified as \n“seriously emotionally disturbed” and require a therapeutic school \nenvironment.   \n6.  HTLA is not a residential program and does not provide any \novernight services. \n7.  Most HTLA students are in the custody of a parent or another \nfamily member.  Although some are in the custody of the Department of \nChildren and Families, this is the exception rather than the rule. \n8.  HTLA is not a program for students who have severe or \nchronic developmental disabilities that result in substantial functional \nlimitations of major life activities.   \n9.  HTLA is not a program for students who suffer from severe or \ndisabling traumatic brain injuries. \n10.  Students who suffer from severe or chronic developmental \ndisabilities that result in substantial functional limitations of major life \nactivities or from severe or disabling traumatic brain injuries are placed in \nother programs within HPS or in qualified and approved outside facilities, \nand not at HTLA. \n11.  The decision to place students at HTLA is made by the \nindividual student’s Pupil Planning Team (PPT) at a meeting in accordance \nwith the requirements of IDEA.  Each student’s PPT team consists of the \nstudent’s parents or guardian as well as teachers, support staff and \n  2\n\nadministrators who are familiar with the student’s needs.  Parents and \nguardians are notified of all PPT team meetings, and every effort is made \nto afford parents and guardians a full opportunity to attend and participate \nin the decision making process. \n12.  Individualized behavior intervention plans have been \ndeveloped for the majority of HTLA students either before or shortly after \ntheir entry to HTLA and are based on an individualized functional behavior \nassessment of the student’s needs.   \n13.  HPS has trained the HTLA teaching staff, as well as other \nspecial education teachers who work with special education students, \nconcerning the development and implementation of behavior intervention \nplans. \n14.  HTLA staff has also been trained to use appropriate and safe \nde-escalation and physical management procedures with students who \nlose control of their behavior.   \n15.  HTLA staff has also been trained to use proper and safe \nphysical restraint procedures as a last resort to prevent injury.  \n16.  Based on the severity of behavior, it is sometimes necessary \nto seclude a student whose behavior is disruptive or dangerous and cannot \nbe immediately de-escalated.  Records are maintained of seclusion \nincidents. \n  3\n\n17.  In addition, based on the severity of behavior, it is sometimes \nnecessary to physically restrain students whose behavior presents a risk of \ninjury to themselves or others.  Again, records are maintained of each \nrestraint incident.   \n18.  HTLA staff are trained and instructed that physical restraint is \nthe last choice in responding to a student who loses control of his or her \nbehavior and threatens injury to him or herself or others.   \n19.  Physical restraint is not child abuse or neglect – it is \nsometimes a necessary means to prevent a student from injuring himself \nor herself or others. \n20.  On August 30, 2004 HPS delivered documents to the State of \nConnecticut Office of the Child Advocate pursuant to a subpoena issued \nfor HTLA secondary level student records. \n  4\n\n21.  Included in the records that were provided were student \nIndividualized Education Plans that identify the name of each student’s \nparent or guardian along with address and telephone number.  Also \nincluded among the documents provided pursuant to the subpoena were \nrecords of student restraint and seclusion at HTLA. \n   \n \n \n________________________________ \nJody S.

My responsibilities include supervision of several of HPS’ \noperational functions. \n25.  The Hartford Board of Education has adopted a policy \nregarding student records in compliance with the Family Educational \nRights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. Section 1232g (FERPA). \n26.  HPS does not provide notice to parents that parent names or \ncontact information will be disclosed upon request without their  \n\nindividualized consent or that parents have the right to object to the \nrelease of such information without prior consent. \n \n \n \n \n________________________________ \nSandra Cruz-Serrano \n \n  Subscribed and sworn to before me this    day of September, 2004 \nat Hartford, Connecticut. \n \n________________________________ \nCommissioner Superior Court \n \n \n \n  2\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT   \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT  \n \n \nTHE STATE OF CONNECTICUT OFFICE OF      \nPROTECTION AND ADVOCACY FOR PERSONS    \nWITH DISABILITIES, and JAMES MCGAUGHEY,    \n    Plaintiffs,          CASE  NO \n  v                   304CV1338(JCH) \n.                   \nHARTFORD BOARD OF EDUCATION,       \nHARTFORD PUBLIC SCHOOLS, and       \nROBERT HENRY, \nDefendants.          \n \nAffidavit of Gail Johnson \n \n27.  I am Director of Human Resources for the Hartford Public \nSchools (HPS). \n28.  I am over the age of eighteen and believe in the obligation of \nthe oath. \n29.  My responsibilities include supervision of HPS’ personnel \nfunctions. \n30.  My department is responsible for investigating employee \nmisconduct and taking or recommending that the Superintendent take \nappropriate corrective action. \n31.  We take reports of alleged abuse or neglect of students very \nseriously.  We investigate each such incident promptly.    \n32.  On occasion, my department receives reports of alleged \nmisconduct involving potential abuse or neglect of HTLA students by staff.  \n\nWe receive these reports both from HTLA administration and from the \nConnecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF), whose \nresponsibility it is to investigate incidents of potential child abuse or \nneglect. \n33.  When we receive such reports, my department promptly \ninvestigates them.  Where DCF is involved, my department’s investigator \nfully cooperates with DCF in a coordinated investigation. \n34.  DCF reports the findings of its investigations to \nSuperintendent Henry, who shares them with me.   \n35.  DCF has not substantiated abuse or neglect in any incident at \nHTLA in at least the last two years. \n36.  In fact, DCF reported that it did not substantiate abuse or \nneglect in a reported incident at HTLA as recently as June 29, 2004. \n  2\n\n37.  HPS has taken and will continue to take17 corrective action in \nevery case involving an HPS or DCF investigation that substantiates child \nabuse or neglect by HPS staff.  \n \n \n________________________________ \nGail Johnson \nDirector for Human Resources \n \n \n  Subscribed and sworn to before me this    day of September, 2004 \nat Hartford, Connecticut. \n \n________________________________ \nCommissioner Superior Court \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17  Nearly all HPS employees are members of collective bargaining units and \nhave the right to challenge disciplinary actions before a neutral arbitrator.
