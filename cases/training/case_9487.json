    "summary": "<p>On January 5, 1995, a group of indigent criminal defendants filed a class action lawsuit against the State of Connecticut and its Public Defender Services Commission under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, the state constitution, and a state statute (C.G.S. 51-289 et seq.), in the Superior Court of Connecticut, Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain, at Hartford.  The plaintiffs alleged that the State did not provide minimally adequate legal representation to indigent defendants in criminal cases in the geographical area (G.A.) courts, the judicial district (J.D.) courts, and the juvenile courts due to high caseloads and a lack of sufficient resources. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys for the ACLU and the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, sought declaratory and injunctive relief. </p><p>On November 1, 1996, the Superior Court (Judge Douglas Lavine) granted four motions to intervene in the lawsuit by individuals who had been convicted of crimes and had filed habeas corpus petitions which were pending at the time. The inclusion of these plaintiffs expanded the proposed class to include indigent criminal defendants in habeas corpus proceedings. Judge Lavine also certified the case as a class action, defining the class as consisting of all indigent persons who are or will be represented by public defenders or special public defenders in the geographic area (G.A.) courts, the judicial district (J.D.) courts, juvenile courts and in criminal habeas proceedings. </p><p>We don't have much information about what happened next, but litigation continued until 1999 when the parties reached a private settlement of the case.  We do not have copies of the settlement documents and the details are therefore unknown.  </p><p>We have no further information on this case.</p><p></p>",

Super. LEXIS 2800, *3  Page 3 of 7 \n [*3]  Legal Discussion \nRooted in the ancient common law, the doctrine of \nThe defendants make two fundamental arguments in support  sovereign immunity from suit was  \nof their motion to dismiss, raising important and legitimate  originally  premised  on  the  monarchical,  semi-\nconcerns.  religious tenet that \"the King can do no wrong.\" \nBorchard, \"Government Liability in Tort,\" 34 Yale \nFirst, they argue that the case should be dismissed due to the \nL.J. 1, 2. In modern times, it is more often explained \ndoctrine of sovereign immunity, which prohibits certain legal \nas a rule of social policy, which protects the state \nclaims against the state from being pursued. \nfrom burdensome interference with the performance \nof  its  governmental  functions  and  preserves  its \nSecond, they argue that the case should be dismissed because \ncontrol  over  state  funds,  property,  and \nit is not justiciable. In substance, defendants' nonjusticiability \ninstrumentalities.Where  a  substantial  claim  is  put \nargument contains three separate prongs. First, defendants \nforth that parties acting pursuant to state authority \nargue that the named defendants can afford the plaintiffs no \nare  acting  unconstitutionally,  sovereign  immunity \nrelief. Second, defendants argue that the separation of powers \ndoes not require dismissal. Antinerella v. Rioux, 229 \ndoctrine prevents the court from ordering the relief requested. \nConn. 479, 487-88, 642 A.2d 699 (1994); Does v. \nThird, defendants argue that none of the plaintiffs' claims are \nHeintz, 204 Conn. 17, 31, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987); \nripe for review in the absence of alleging and proving \"injury-\nDuguay v. Hopkins, 191 Conn. 222, 464 A.2d 45, \nin-fact\"  or  \"actual  harm.\"  These  arguments  will  now  be \n(1983). The complaint in this case alleges in part that \ndiscussed. \nthe named defendants are acting unconstitutionally, \npursuant  to  both  state  and  federal [*6]   law,  in \nA. Sovereign Immunity \nnumerous  respects.  This  court  must  consider  the \npleadings \"broadly and realistically\" in ruling on the \nDefendants correctly cite numerous cases for the undisputed \npending motion to dismiss, Beaudoin v. Town Oil \nproposition that the state generally cannot be sued without its \nCo., 207 Conn. 575, 588, 542 A.2d 1124 (1988). As \nconsent. Barde v. Board of Trustees, 207 Conn. 59, 64, 539 \nnoted in Horton v. Meskill, 172 Conn. at 624-25, \nA.2d 1000 (1988). They also concede that certain exceptions \nquoting Block, \"Suits against Government Officers \nto the doctrine of sovereign [*4]  immunity have evolved over \nand  the  Sovereign  Immunity  Doctrine,\"  59 \nthe years, including cases involving claims for declaratory or \nHarv.L.Rev., 1060, 1080: \ninjunctive relief based on an allegation that a state official has \nacted  in  an  unconstitutional  manner.

Because of the manner in which the  authority,  the  interest  in  the  protection  of  the \nplaintiff's right to be free from the consequences of \ncomplaint has been pleaded, defendants argue, this case does \nsuch  action  outweighs  the  interest  served  by  the \nnot  fall  within  any  exception  to  the  general  rule  barring \nsovereign  immunity  doctrine.  Moreover,  the \nactions  against  the  state.

The court further noted that \n(1974), in which he states:  while  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity \nis [*7]  deeply rooted in our common law, \"it has,  \n  \n3 In their memoranda in support of the motion to dismiss, the defendants have on occasion tended to blur the distinction between adequately \npleading certain allegations, and proving them at trial. At this early stage of the case, of course, for purposes of ruling on the Motion to \nDismiss, the Court must assume that the allegations as pleaded are true and does not inquire into the merits of the case. Lamposna v. Jacobs, \n209 Conn. 724, 728, 553 A.2d 175 (1989). Whether plaintiffs are able to prove any or all of the allegations set out in the complaint must, of \ncourse, await trial, should this case proceed to trial. \n  \n\n 1996 Conn. Super.

Defendant  Rowland  is charged  with  responsibility for \nprotection  the  rights  of  the  citizens  of  the  state  and  is \no~ \nrequired  to  prepare  a  budget  for  the  State  and  to  enforce  the  laws \nand  uphold  the  constitutions  of  the  United  States  and  of  the  State \nI§ \nof  Connecticut.  Defendant  Rowland,  pursuant  to  C.G.S.·  51-\n289(a),  appoints  the  Chairman  of  the  Public  Defender  Services \nCommission.  Defendant  Rowland  is  sued  in  his  official  capacity. \n10.  Defendant  Public  Defender  Services  commission  is  charged \nI \nwith  carrying  out  the  purposes  and  requirements  of  the  public \nI defender  statute,  C.G.S.  §  51-289  et  seq.,  including  the \nrequirement  that,  pursuant  to  C.G.S.  §  51-293,  the  Commission \nI \nappoint  \"as  many  assistant ... and  deputy  assistant public  defenders \nI \nI for  the  superior  court  as  the  criminal  or  delinquency business  of \nI \nthe  court  may  require.\". \nI \n11.  Defendants  Carl  D.  Eisenmann,  Chairman,  Reverend \nI \nMonsignor  William  A.  Genuario,  Honorable  E.  Curtissa  Cofield, \nHonorable  John  F.  Kavanewsky,Jr.,  Diane  Randall,  Richard  P. \nGilardi,  and  Linda  Kelly  are  and  at  all  times  pertinent  hereto \n\n, I \nI \nI \n-6-\nI \nhave  been  duly members  of  the  Public  Defender  Services  Commission \nI \nI \nand,  pursuant  to  C.G.S.  §  51-289  et  seq.,  are  charged  with  ! \nI \nI \ncarrying  out  the  purposes  and  requirements  of  the  public  defender \nstatute,  including  determination  of  the  budgetary needs  of  the \nagency.  They  are  sued  in  their official  capacities. \nIII.  CLASS.  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n12.  This  action  is brought  as  a  class  action pursuant  to \nPractice  Book  §§  87-90. \n13.  Plaintiffs  file  this  complaint  on  behalf  of  themselves \nand  all others  similarly situated who  are  or will  in  the  future  be \nadversely  affected by  the  unconstitutional  practices  of  the \nindigent  criminal  defense  system  in  Connecticut,  and  who  seek \nequitable  relief  for  the  unlawful  and  unconstitutional  acts  of \ndefendants  in  failing  to  adequately  fund  public  defender  services \nin the  State  of  Connecticut. \n14.  Named  plaintiffs Rivera,  Young,  Doe,  Fuentes,  and \nSouthwick  are  indigent  criminal  defendants  awaiting  trial  in  the \nGeographic  Area,  Judicial  Districts,  and  Juvenile  Courts.  Named \nplaintiffs  Hidden,  Rosedom  and  Raymond  are  indigent  persons  with \npending  criminal  habeas  petitions . \n. 15.  The  class  plaintiffs  seek  to  represent  is  composed  of \nall  indigent  persons  who  are  or  will  be  represented by public \ndefenders  or  special  public  defenders  in  the  Geographic  Area \n(G.A.)  courts,  Judicial  Districts  (J.D.),  Juvenile  Courts,  or  in \ncriminal  habeas  proceedings. \n\n-7-\n16.  The  class  is so  numerous  that  joinder of  all members  is \nimpracticable. \n17.  There  are  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  the \nmembers  of  plaintiff  class  in that: \na.  All  members  of  the  class  are  or will  be  deprived  of \nrights  guaranteed by  the  Sixth and  Fourteenth Amendments  to  the -. \nUnited  States  Constitution,  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983, .Article  First, \n§§  1,  8,  10,  12,  and  20  of  the  Connecticut  Constitution,  and \nC.G.S.  §  51-289  et  seq. \nb.  The  claims  of  the  named  plaintiffs are \nrepresentative  of  the  claims  presented by  the _class  as  a  whole. \nc.  All  members  of  the  plaintiff  class  seek  injunctive \nrelief  to  prevent  future  violations  of  their  statutory and \nconstitutional  rights. \n18.  The  claims  of  the  representative  parties  are  typical of \nthe  claims  of  the  class  ln  that  the  constitutional  and  statutory \ndeprivations  caused  by  defendants  and  claimed  by  the  named \nplaintiffs  are  the  same  as  for  all other members  of  the  class  and \npredominate  over  individual  claims. \n19.  The  representative  parties will  fairly and  adequately \nprotect  the  interests  of  the  class.  The  named  plaintiffs have  no \nII \ninterests  antagbnistic  to  the  class.  Further,-all plaintiffs are \nI \nrepresented by  attorneys  experienced  in  federal  and  state \nI \nI  constitutional  litigation. \n20.  The  prosecution  of  separate  actions  by  individual \nmembers  of  the  class would  create  a  risk of  inconsistent  or \n\nl \n~ \nI \ni \n-8-\nvarying  adjudications  with  respect  to  individual members  of  the \nclass  which  would  establish  incompatible  standards  of  conduct  for \n.,' ...  \nthe parties  opposing  the  class. \n21.  Defendants  have  consistently acted  and  refused  to  act  on \ngrounds  generally applicable  to  the  class.  Thus,  final  injunctive \nreli~f with  respect  to  the  class  ~s a  whole  will  be  appropriate. \nIV.  STATEMENT  OF  FACTS \n22.  Pursuant  to  C.G.S.  §  51-289(g),  the  defendant  Public \nDefender  Services  Commission  has  been  designated  to  carry out  the \npurposes  of  the  public  defender  statutes,  C.G.S.  §  51-289  et ggg. \nIt consists  of  seven  members,  two  of  whom  are  appointed by  the \nChief  Justice  of  the  Connecticut  Supreme  Court,  four  of  whom  are \nappointed  by  the'Speaker  of  the  House,  President  Pro  Tempore  of \nthe  Senate,  Minority Leader  of  the  House  and  Minority  Leader  of \nthe  Senate,  respectively,  and  one  of  whom,  the  Chairman,  is \nappointed  by  the  Governor.  The  defendant  Commission  not  only \nappoints  all  attorneys  and  other  employees  of  the  Division  of \nPublic  Defender  Services,  but  it is authorized to establish a \ncompensation plan  for  the  Division  and  make  personnel  and  other \nrules  relating to  the  Division's  operation. \n23.  Pursuant  to  C.G.S.  §  51-297(f),  public  defender  services \nare  provided  to  \"indigentn  accused persons  in thirty-three  public \ndefender  offices  throughout  the  state. \n24.  Only  148  full-·time  lawyers  and  one  part-time  lawyer  are \ncurrently  authorized by  the  Commission  to  represent  all  indigent \ncriminal  defendants,  juveniles,  and  those  filing habeas  corpus \n\n-9-\ncases  and  appeals.  These  attorneys  are  supplemented  by  forty \neight  full-time  and  two  part-time  investigators,  sixteen  social \nworkers,  fifty-six  full-time  and  four  part-time  clerical,  one \nparalegal,  and  eleven  administrative  staff. \n25.  The  state public  defender  system  fails  to provide \neffective  repr~sentatl0n as  set  out  ln  or \nCriminal  Justice,  Chapter  5;  the  National  Advisory  Commission  on \nCriminal  Justice  Standards  and  Goals;  and  other professional \nstandards  governing  the  provision  of  criminal  defense  services. \nA.  CASELOADS \n26.  During  1993-94,  the  numbers  of  cases  handled  by  the \nPublic  Defender's  office  included  88,000  G.A.  cases,  4,400  J.D. \ncases,  and  5,000  juvenile  cases. \n27.  Connecticut's  public  defender  caseloads  far  exceed  those \nset by  national  standards.  For  example,  the  National  Advisory \nCommission  on  criminal  Justice  Standards  and  Goals  recommend \nmaximum  yearly case  assignments  which  should  not  exceed  150 \nfelonies  per attorney per year,  400  misdemeanors  per  attorney per \nyear,  200  juvenile  cases  per  attorney per year,  or  25  appeals  per \nattorney per year .. \n28.  Caseloads  for  public  defenders  in  G.A.  courts  are  at \ncrisis proportions,  now  averaging  1,045  cases  in the  G.A.  courts \nper  year  per  attorney,  ranging  up  to  1,200-1,400  cases  per  year \n,  per  attorney  in  the  most  congested  courts.  In  one  court,  the \ncaseload was  1,483  cases  per  attorney  for  the  year  1993-94. \n\n-10-\n29.  Caseloads  for  public  defenders  in  juvenile  courts  are \nsimilarly unmanageable,  averaging  716  cases  per year  per  attorney \nin  1993-94,  ranging  up  to  1,571  cases  per year  in the  most \ncongested  court. \n30.  In  at  least  three  J.D.  courts,  caseloads  exceed  150 \nmajor  felonies  per  attorney per year.  In one  J.D.  court,  in  1993.-\n94,  the  average  caseload was  271  major  felony  cases.  The \nincreased  seriousness  of  the  J.D.  caseload within  the  last  several \nyears,  particularly in the  urban  courts,  including  an  increased \nnumber  of  violent  cases,  homicides,  serious  drug-related cases, \nchild sexual  abuse  cases,  and  mandatory  minimum  sentences,  have \nmade  many  J.D.  caseloads  untenable. \n31.  Many  public  defenders  assigned  to  handle  misdemeanors \nand  felonies  are  now  required to  handle  an  overflow of  appeals  in \naddition  to  their  regular  caseloads,  further  hampering  their \nability to  provide  adequate  representation  to  their  already \nexisting  clients. \n32.  Those  public  defenders  now  assigned  to  the  increased \nnumber  of  capital  cases  also  have  the  pressure  of  continuing  to \ncarry non-capital  cases  on  their  caseloads. \n33.  Supervisors  are  assigned full  caseloads  because  of  the \noverload,  leaving  little time  for  supervision  of  less  experienced \nattorneys. \n34.  Caseloads  for  public  defenders  in  the  habeas  division \nare  extremely  heavy,  contributing  to  delays  faced  by  class  members \nin  adjudication  of  their claims. \n\n-11-\n35.  Defendant  Public  Defender  Commission  has  failed  to \nestablish any  caseload or workload  standards  of  its own  to  ensure \n.that plaintiffs and  members  of  their  class  are  afforded  effective \nassistance  of  counsel. \n36.  Connecticut's  public  defender  expenditures  per case  are \nfar  below  national  norms,  even  though  the  cost  of  doing  business \nis  highei  in  Connecticut  than  in other  states. \n37.  A  1986  study by  the  Bureau  of  Justice  Statistics,  U.S. \nDepartment  of  Justice,  found  that  Connecticut  ranked  45th  among  50 \nstates  and  the  District of  Columbia,  in average  cost  per case  of \n$138.00.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Connecticut's  per  case \nexpenditures  have  continued  to  be  far  below  the  national  norm. \n38.  From  1984-85  to  1988-89,  over  a  five  year period,  public \ndefender  caseloads  grew  78%  while  public  defender  staff  grew  by \nonly  24%.  The  caseload/staff  ratio  continues  to be  far  below  the \nnumber  necessary  to  ensure  adequate  representation. \nB.  SPECIAL  PUBLIC  DEFENDERS \n39.  In  cases  of  conflict-of-interest,  private  lawyers  are \nappointed  as  IIspecial public  defenders. II  In  addition,  private \nlawyers  receive  special  public  defender  contracts  from  the  Public \nDefender  Services  Commission  to  handle  certain misdemeanor, \nfelony,  juvenile,  habeas,  and  appeals  cases. \n40.  The  hourly  rates  paid  to  special  public  defenders  are \nseriously  inadequate  and  among  the  lowest  in  the  entire  country. \nFor  felony  cases,  appointed  special  public  defenders  are  paid only \n$20.00/hour  f6r  out-of-court  work  and  $25.00/hour  for  in-court \n\n·-12-\nwork,  with  the . maximum  daily  limit  for  out·-of-court  work,  $120.00, \nand  in-court  work,  $150.00.  For  misdemeanors,  special  public \ndefenders  are  paid  $35.00  per  day  for  a  court  appearance. \n41.  Thirty-two  lawyers  on  contract  with  the  defendant  Public \nDefender  Services  Commission  are  also  among  the  lowest  paid  in the \ncountry with  a  rate  of  $150.00  for  a  case  prosecute \nthe  Superior  Court  (misdemeanors  through  Class  D  felonies)  and \n$325.00  for  Class  A  through  C  felonies  prosecuted  in  Part  A  of  the \nJudicial  District.  In  juvenile  cases,  the  rate  is  $150.00  per \npetition. \n42.  Because  of  these  unreasonable  low  hourly  fees  and \nwhich  increases  the  burden  on  indigent  criminal  defense  counsel \nand  effectively creates  a  financial  disincentive  for  special \npublic  defenders  to  provide  thorough  and  effective  defense \nservices  consistent  with  minimum  standards  of  representation.  The \nfailure  to  provide  adequately  for  essential  investigative \nresources  as  well  as  other defense-related expenses  imposes  a \nfurther  substantial  burden  on  special  public  defenders. \n43.  Inadequacy  of  funding  available  for  special  public \ndefenders  also  causes  an  inconsistency  among  the  public  defender \nI \n.1  offices  in  the  application of  the  conflict  of  interest policy. \nSome  offices  allow public  defenders  to  represent  co-defendants  and \nappoint  special  public  defenders  when  an  actualll  conflict  arises. \nlI\n\n-13-\nOther  offices  appoint  special  public  defenders  immediately  in co \ndefendant  cases. \n44.  There  are  no  objective  standards  for  selection,  training, \nor  supervision of  special  public  defenders. \nC.  SUPPLEMENTAL  RESOURCES \n45. \nerv~ces  omm~ss~o \nemploys  only  fifty  investigators  statewide  to  serve  the  caseloads \nfor  all public  defenders  and  IIspecialll  public  defenders,  severely \nlimiting  the  ability of  defendants  to  receive  adequate \ninvestigative  services  and  causing  a  backlog  of  criminal  cases. \n46.  Defendant  Commission  has  failed  to  adequately  implement \nan  effective  recruitment,  hiring,  monitoring  and  evaluation  system \nfor  investigators,  causing an  inconsistent  quality of \ninvestigators  among  all  the  offices.  Because  of  the  inadequacy of \nsome  investigative  services,  some  public  defenders  either  forego \ninvestigation of  their cases,  or  conduct  such  investigations \nthemselves. \n47.  Only  sixteen social  workers  are  available  for  all public \nd~fender offices  and  special public  defenders.  The  lack  of \nadequate  social  work  services  impedes  the  ability of  public \ndefenders  to  adequately  investigate  and  prepare  pre- and  post \ndispositional  alternatives  for  their clients. \n48.  There  are  insufficient  funds  for  other  support  staff, \nexpert  witnesses,  psychiatric  examinations,  and  scientific  tests. \n49.  Law  library materials  are  inadequate.  Furthermore, \nalthough  the  state's attorney's  office  has  access  to  computerized \n\n-14-\nresearch,  the  public  defenders  do  not.  Only  the public  defender's \nappellate  office  has  access  to  a  limited  system. \n50.  Access  to  adequate  office  equipment  is severely \nhampered.  Many  offices  have  an  insufficient  number  of  telephones \nand  computers.  Photocopiers  are  old  and  frequently  break  down. \n51.  While  repeated  studies  have  shown  the  need  for  increased \ncomputerization  of  public  defender  operations,  only  three  of \nthirty-one  field  offices  have  access  to  the  Judicial  Information \nSystem  (JIS).  Very  few  offices  have  any  formal  case  tracking \nsystem.  There  is  no  computer  networking  among  public  defender \noffices  or  between  field  offices  and  the  central  administrative \noffice  or  the  central  appellate  office. \n52.  Although  the  Chief  Public  Defender  in his Annual  Report· \nof  1993  acknowledged  that  there  are  IIdemonstrable  efficiencies  and \neconomies  that  ought  to  be  available  through  increased \ncomputerization ... nothing  significant  can  be  done  because  the \nnecessary  funding  for  equipment,  operating  costs,  support  persons \nand  materials  is unavailable. II  (p.  12) \n53.  Funds  and  programs  available  for  training are \ninadequate.  Training opportunities  have  been  limited as  a  result. \n54.  Because  of  their overwhelming  caseloads,  public \ndefenders  are  unable  to  spend  time  reading  the  limited  library \nmaterials  received  in  their offices.  Public  defenders  do  not \nreceive  adequate  training  to  keep  current  on  the  constantly \nchanging  status  of  criminal  law. \n\n-15-\nD.  OFFICE  AND  COURTROOM  CONDITIONS \n55.  Office  conditions  at  many  public  defender  sites  are \ndeplorable,  with  inadequate  office  space  even  for  the  existing \nnumber  of  attorneys  and  their  support  staff. \n56.  Some  public  defender  offices  also  lack  adequate  private \nfacilities  for  interviewing  clients,  forcing  public  defenders  to \ninterview  their clients  inside  the  lock-up,  on  a  bench  inside  or \noutside  the  courtroom,  within  listening  range  of  other persons. \nDefendants  have  not  taken  adequate  steps  to  eliminate  these \nconditions. \n57.  The  public  defender  offices  do  not  accept  collect  calls \nfrom  their  clients,  impairing  the  ability of  the  plaintiffs  and \nmembers  of  their  class  to  communicate  with  their attorneys. \nE.  SCREENING  OF  CASES \n58.  The  Commission  promulgated Guidelines  for  Determining \nI \nI \nFinancial  Eligibility for  public  Defender  Services  in October \n! \n1976,  which  were  amended  in 1993.  Some  offices  follow  the \n\\  determinations  of  indigency  set  forth  in this  document,  while \n\\  others  impose  no  standards  at  all. \nI \n59.  Pursuant  to  these  Guidelines,  any  indigent  charged with \nI \na  felony  is  entitled to  be  represented by  a  public  defender;  if \nI . \ncharged with  a  misdemeanor,  an  indigent  defendant  is not  entitled \nI \nto  a  public  defender  unless  the  disposition  of  the  case  may  result \nin  incarceration or probation. \n60.  Some  offices  collect  fees  from  indigent  incarcerated \nclients,  violating  the  statutory reimbursement  policy. \n\n. , \n-16-\n61.  In  at  least  one  G.A.,  the  public  defender  office \nrequires  accused misdemeanants  to  see  the  prosecutor, \n·,  unaccompanied  !?y  counsel,  before  they  are  allowed  to  complete  an \n.. \n.~~ \napplication  for  public  defender  services. \n62.  In  three  G.A.  courts,  an  early morning  screening  program \nundue  pressure  on  public  defenders  to work  out  plea agreements \nprior  to  completing  adequate  interviews  with  their clients  or \ninvestigating  their  cases. \nF.  HARMS  TO  PLAINTIFF  CLASSES \n63.  The  effects  of  these  extreme  caseloads  and  inadequate \nresources  on  the  quality of  legal  representation are  pervasive, \nI: \nI' \nIi \n,  a~d harm  plaintiffs  and  members  of  their class  at .every  stage .of \ntheir  criminal  cases.  Public  defenders  are  not  able  to  spend \nadequate  time  interviewing  their clients,  counseling  their \nI: \nIi  clients,  or  even  explaining  the  basic  information  to  their  clients \nIi \nIi \n\"  about  the  upcoming  court  proceedings.  Forced  excessive  caseloads \nI; \nII  and  inadequat~ resources  prevent  public  defehders  from  spending \nI\" ' \niI \nIi \nadequate time  reviewing  each client's  file,  conducting  necessary \n!\\ \nIi  legal  research,  conducting  necessary  fact  investigation and \nwitness  preparation,  pursuing motions  for  speedy  trials,  preparing \nIi \nI; \n\"  for  trial,  filing. certain pretrial motions,  exploring  pretrial \n,I \nj! \nd \ni:  alternatives  to  incarceration  as  well  as  sentencing options,  and \nI! \n;i \n!!  prosecuting  habeas  petitions  in  a  timely  and  effective manner. \n\\1 \n,I  64.  Indigent  criminal  defense  services  function  without \n\\ \nI  regard  for,  and  in violation of,  accepted minimum  standards  for \n\\ \n1 \nI \n\n-17-\ntraining,  workload,  and  resources  including  those  promulgated  by \nthe  American  Bar  Association,  the  National  Study  Commission  on \nDefense  Services,  the  National  Legal  Aid  and  Defender  Association, \nand  the  National  Advisory  Commission  on  Criminal  Justice  Standards \nand Goals. \n65.  Excessive  caseloads  and  inadequate  resources  have  caused \nhigh  stress,  low  staff morale,  and  burnout.  Because  the  numbers \nof  attorneys  are  insufficient,  there  are  no  mechanisms  for  relief \nwhen  staff  is  overburdened. \n66.  Excessive  caseloads  have  also  caused  mistrust  among \nI \nplaintiffs  and  members  of  their  class  regarding  the  adequacy  of \nII \ntheir public  defenders.  In part,  because  weeks  or months  go  by \nI! \nwithout  contact  from  their attorneys,  ~any indigent  criminal \ndefendants  develop  an  understandable  lack  of  confidence  in  the \npublic  defender's  office. \ni  67.  According  to  the  19\"93  Annual  Report  of  the  Chief  Public \nI! \nDefender,  \"the  increasing  difficulty public  defenders  are  having \nin keeping  up  with  the  constantly excessive  and  serious  caseloadsll \nhas  caused  a  \"slowdown  in the  public  defender's  ability to  resolve \ncases  expeditiously  leading  to  increased  court  delays  and \nexacerbating  the  priSon  overcrowding  problem  by  prolonging  the \nI \npretrial  incarceration of  accused  persons  who  cannot  make  bail. \nI  II \nI \nI  (p.  7) \nII \nIi \n68.  Overwhelming  caseloads  substantially co~tribute to  the \nfact  that  virtually  all  cases  \"plead  out.\"  In  the  G.A.  courts,  a \njury  trial was  initiated in only  0.1%  (or  64  out  of  55,767)  of  all \n\n-18-\ncases  disposed of  in  FY  1992-93.  In  the  J.D.  offices,  a  jury \ntrial was  initiated in only  4.6%  (or  89  out  of  1,894)  of  all  cases \ndisposed of  during  a  similar time  period.  In  1993-94,  a  jury \ntrial was  initiated in  0.1%  (or  49  out  of  50,483)  of  all  cases  in \nthe  G.A.  courts,  and  3.9%  (or  76  out  of  1,903)  of  all  cases  in the \nJ.D.  courts. \n69.  Indigent  criminal  defendants  in the  state court  system \nare  not  afforded  criminal  process  and  representation  substantially \nsimilar  to  that  afforded  criminal  defendants  of  means. \nI  G.  DEFENDANTS'  LONG-STANDING  KNOWLEDGE  OF  INADEQUATE \ni \nSERVICES \ni \ni \n70.  Defendants  have  long  been  aware  of  the  crisis  in \n! \ni \nI·  indigent  criminal  representation,' but  have  failed  to  take  the \nI \nI \nI necessary  steps  to  address  the  problems. \n71.  The  Annual  Reports  of  the  Chief  Public  Defender  from \n\\ \nI \ni  1976  to  the  present  consistently document  the  heavy  caseloads  and \ni \ninsufficient  supportive  personnel  and  facilities. \n72.  In  1991,  the  Commission  to  Study  the  Management  of  State \nGovernment  (the  IIThomas  Commission\")  observed  that  \"caseloads  have \nrisen dramatically, II  by  80%,  in  the  G.A.  courts  between  the  1984-\n85  and  1988-89  fiscal  years,  while  the  number  of  attorneys  during \nthat  same  time  period had  increased  only  31%. \n73.  The  Thomas  Commission  report,  transmitted  to  defendant \ngovernor  and  members  of  the  defendant  Commission,  further  observec \nthat  the  comparisons  in  the  level  of  public  defender  services  in \nConnecticut  and  other  states  IIraise  concerns  about  the  ability of \n\n-19-\nthe  Division  of  Public  Defender  Services  to  continue  to provide \nconstitutionally adequate  representation  to  its ever-increasing \nnumbers  of  clients,lI  (p.  32)  and  that  [c]urrent  attorneys  in  the \nII \nG.A.  courts  are  so  overloaded with  cases  that  representation  of \nindividual  clients may  be  compromised .... 11  (p.  98) \n74.  In  spite  of  the  recommendations  and  warnings  of  the \nThomas  Commission,  defendants  failed  to  act  appropriately  to \naddress  the  need  for  additional  indigent  defense  resources. \n75.  From  1992  to  the  present,  in annual  budget  submissions \nby  the  Chief  Public  Defender,  in Annual  Reports  of  the  Chief \nPublic  Defender,  and  in  testimony  and  memoranda  from  the  chief \npublic  defender's  office  to  the  Governor's  office,  the \nAppropriations  Co\"mmittee  and  Judicial .Appropriations  Subcommittee. \nof  the  Connecticut  legislature,  defendants  have  been  warned \nrepeatedly  about  the  crisis  in  the  caseloads  and  the  harmful \nconsequences  of  failing  to  increase  public  defender  resources. \nDefendants  have  consistently  failed,  however,  to take  appropriate \naction  to  correct  the deficiencies. \n76.  Plaintiffs  and  members  of  their class  suffer  immediate \nand  irreparable  injury  for  which  there  is  no  adequate  remedy  at \nlaw. \nv.  LEGAL  CLAIMS \nA.  FIRST  COUNT \n(J.D.

AT HARTFORD \nDefendants \nNOTICE OF SETTLEMENT \nNotice is hereby given to members of the plaintiff class in Rivera v. Rowland, No. CV -95-0545629S, and other \ninterested individuals, that the parties to the litigation have agreed to a resolution of the case.  The lawsuit, brought on \nbehalf of clients of the Connecticut public defender system, alleged deficiencies in the staffing and operation of that \nsystem.  During the pendency of this action, defendants have made a number of significant improvements to the public \ndefender system.  Among other things, additional funding has been appropriated for the system which ultimately will \nbe used to hire approximately 80 new attorney and support staff.  In addition, for the first time since 1983, defendants \nhave increased the rates of compensation paid to special public defenders.  They have also adopted attorney caseload \ngoals; developed and implemented a more comprehensive attorney training program; enhanced existing practice \nguidelines; substantially revised the manner in which they supervise and evaluate attorney performance; and announced \ntheir intention to appoint a Director of Special Public Defenders, who will be responsible for the administration and \noperation of the special public defender program. \nIn light of these changes, plaintiffs have agreed to withdraw the lawsuit, subject to the Court's approval.  By its \nterms, however, this withdrawal shall have no effect on any claims that may be made by any member of the plaintiff \nclass in direct review of any criminal conviction or adjudication by way of appeal or writ of error, in any sentence \nreview proceeding, in any juvenile delinquency proceeding, or in any habeas corpus proceeding arising out of a \ncriminal or juvenile delinquency conviction or adjudication. \nThe parties' joint motion to withdraw the lawsuit which describes in further detail the changes and \nimprovements to the public defender system is on file for public inspection at the Office of the Clerk of the Superior \nCourt, Judicial District of Hartford, under the above docket number.  In addition, copies of the motion may be \nobtained by writing to Robin Dahlberg, American Civil Liberties Union, 125 Broad Street, New York, NY 10004. \nAny member of the plaintiff class who wishes to oppose approval of the resolution of the lawsuit may submit \nwritten objections to the attention of Judge Douglas Lavine in care of the Clerk of the Court, Superior Court, Judicial \nDistrict of Hartford, 95 Washington Street, Hartford, CT  06106, on or before Wednesday, July 29, 1999. \nA court hearing in connection with this matter will be held at 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday, August 3, 1999 in \nCourtroom 312 of the Superior Court, 95 Washington Street, Hartford, CT. \nA class member is an individual who (a) was the subject of a pending criminal or juvenile delinquency \nproceeding in Superior Court or a pending petition for a writ of habeas corpus on July 2, 1999, and (b) was \nrepresented in that proceeding or in connection with that petition by a public defender or a special public defender. \nAny individual represented by a public defender or special public defender for purposes of appeal only is not a \nmember of the class.  A person previously represented but not represented on July 2, 1999 by a public defender or \nspecial public defender is not a member of the class.

Bk. § 9-9. A proposed withdrawal of action is attached as Exhibit 1. \nI \n,  In  this  class  action  lawsuit,  plaintiffs  alleged  that  severe  understaffing,  excessive \ni caseloads, inadequate policies and procedures, and other systemic deficiencies in the Connecticut \n: public defender system made it unlikely that the system's clients \\vould receive constitutionally \nand  statutorily  adequate  representation  in  criminal  and  juvenile  delinquency  proceedings. \nPlaintiffs further alleged that unless fundamental changes were made in the system, significant \nnumbers of indigent persons represented by the system were tlu'eatened with the deprivation of \ntheir rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the \nConnecticut Constitution and various state statutes. \nDefendants  strongly  disagreed  with plaintiffs'  position.  In  response  to  the  plaintiffs' \nclaims, defendants asserted that the Connecticut public defender system has continued to provide \neffective  representation  to  clients  in  all  matters  in  which  public  defender  representation  is \ni \nprovided. Defendants also raised or asserted several legal and jurisdictional defenses. In addition, \nI \n; I \nsince this lawsuit was filed, defendants have made a number of changes to the Connecticut public \n! i \ni \nI \ni I defender system. These include the following: \nI \n1 \n\n.. \nI  '\" \n1.  The budget approved by the General Assembly for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998 \n: included additional  funding  for  the  Public  Defender Services Commission in  the amount of \ni \n$1,350,000. This funding was used to increase the staffing of the public defender system by 20 \n, new attorney and support positions, to increase the funds available for outside services, such as \nexpert witnesses,  by $170,000, and to  increase the funds  available for non-contractual special \npublic defenders by $345,000. \n2.  During August 1997 the Habeas Corpus Unit was moved to new space in the Office of \nthe Chief Public Defender in Hartford. The permanent staffing of the unit has increased from 3 \nfull-time attorneys to 4 full-time attorneys and one full-time investigator has been employed. \n3.  The budget approved by the' General Assembly for the fiscal year ending June 30,  1999 \nincluded 4 new positions for staffing a new Judicial District office and 2 new positions for a new \nJuvenile office, both in New Britain. \n4.  The budget approved  by  the  General Assembly for  the  July  1999 through June  2001 \nbiennium included increased funding in the amount of $4,556,370 for FY 2000 and an additional \n. increase of $2,184,992 for FY 2001. This total includes funding for 29 new permanent positions \nin FY 2000, including a new Executive Assistant Public Defender position to serve as Director of \nSpecial Public Defenders, and funding for an additional 25 new permanent positions in FY 2001. \nThe total also includes an  increase in the appropriation for training,  and funds  for associated \nexpenses, for the purchase of 161 new computers and other equipment, and for an increase in the \nrates of compensation for special public defenders. \n5.  The Public Defender Services Commission adopted the following new or revised policies \non June 15, 1999:  Caseload Goals for Public Defenders; Duties and Responsibilities of Director \nof Special Public Defenders; Special Public Defender Supervision and Evaluation; Special Public \nDefender Qualifications and  Training;  Special  Public Defender Compensation  Rates;  Annual \nPerformance  Evaluation of Attorneys;  Amendment to  Guideline 2.1  of the  Public  Defender \nServices  Commission's  \"Guidelines  on  Indigent  Defense\"  concerning  training;  and,  other \n'.  changes to the \"Guidelines on Indigent Defense\". Copies of said policies are appended to this \ni: \nmotion as Exhibits 2 through 9.  . \n. i \n6.  According to the Annual Reports prepared by the Office of the Chief Public Defender \nbetween January 1995 and January 1999 the average caseload pe~ attorney in the Jud,icial District \nI \noffices has declined from  113  cases per year to  61  cases per year,  the average caseload per \nI \n!  attorney in the Geographical Area offices has declined from 1045 cases per year to 618 cases per \nyear, and the average caseload per attorney in the Juvenile Matters offices has declined from 716 \ncases per year to 544 cases per year. In addition, according to the Annual Reports, an attorney \nhas been added to  the staff of the  Training Department,  and additional computers and  legal \nI.  research software have been acquired. \nThe  plaintiffs  understand  that  the  proposed  withdrawal  does  not  create  any  legal \nobligations on the part of any defendant. Nevertheless, in light of the many positive changes in \n,.  Connecticut's public defender system that have occurred during the pendency of this litigation it \n2 \n\nis no longer necessary to proceed with the litigation. Accordingly, subject to appropriate notice to \nthe class, if required by the court, plaintiffs acting on behalf of themselves and plaintiff class \nmove for permission to  withdraw this action, in accordance with Conn.  Prac.  Bk.  § 9-9.

Familiarity with the facts is assumed. In summary, plaintiffs allege that the public defender system \n \nis failing to provide minimally adequate representation to indigent criminal defendants because of high caseloads and an \nunderallocation of resources. The issues raised in defendants’ September 13, 1996 motion do not relate to formal discovery, e.g., \nthe taking of depositions, responding to interrogatories, and the like. Nor do they relate to contacts with any of defendants’ former \nemployees. While defendants’ written motion related only to attorney employees of defendant Public Defender Services \nCommission, in light of the representation by plaintiffs’ counsel that they may wish to contact other nonmanagerial employees as \nwell, defendants orally moved the court to consider such non-attorney employees as well. The Court has done so in this \nmemorandum of decision and the accompanying protective order. \n \n2  Counsel agreed at oral argument on December 6, 1996, that the second issue raised in the motion for protective order, relating to \ndisclosures of privileged information, was somewhat premature. The Court will therefore defer consideration of this issue, and will \n \ndeny the motion without prejudice as to this issue, with the expectation that it may again be raised at a later date. \n \n3  As defendants note, a similar provision existed in Disciplinary Rule 7-104 of the former Code of Professional Responsibility. The \nterm “party” in the former rule was interpreted to include “those individuals who can bind it to a decision or settle controversies on \n \nits behalf.” Frey v. Department of Health and Human Services, 106 F.R.D. 32, 35 (E.D.N.Y.1985). \n \n4  While the complaint in this case contains allegations relating to special public defenders, the protective order sought by defendants \ndoes not relate to them. Consequently, this opinion does not relate to special public defenders. \n \n \n5  For enlightening discussions of Rule 4.2 and DR 7-104, see Kurlantzik, “The Prohibition on Communications With an Adverse \nParty,” 51 Conn. B.J. 136 (1977), and Leubsdorf, “Communicating With Another Lawyer’s Client: The Lawyer’s Veto and the \n \nClient’s Interests,” 127 U.Pa. L.Rev. 683 (1979). For an analysis of some of the particular issues raised when a multi-party entity \nsuch as a corporation or a governmental unit is involved, see Note: DR 7-104 of the Code of Professional Responsibility Applied to \nthe Government “Party,” 62 Minn. L.Rev. 1007 (1977). \n \n6  Defendants note in their November 1, 1996 reply memorandum that individual public defenders are employed by the Public \nDefender Services Commission, which has the authority to appoint and remove or suspend public defenders.

While the rule may still apply to lawyer “parties” and in some circumstances, attorneys employed by “parties,” \n \nthe assistant public defenders in this case are far better positioned to avoid being disadvantaged by opposing counsel’s “superior \nknowledge and skill,” see Higgins v.
