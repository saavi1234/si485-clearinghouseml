    "summary": "<p>On February 23, 2006, four men incarcerated at the District of Columbia Jail filed this 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 class action suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs claimed that D.C. Jail officials violated their Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendment rights in detaining them beyond their release dates and violated their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for conducting blanket strip searches.</p>\r\n<p>The Barnes case followed a nearly identical class action lawsuit <a href=\"../../../../case/5502/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bynum v. District of Columbia</a>. The Bynum case resulted in a $14 million settlement.</p>\r\n<p>The Barnes plaintiffs alleged that while the District agreed to stop its practices of overdetention and strip searches, the Bynum settlement did not require that those practices stop. According to the plaintiffs, the unlawful practices of at issue in the Bynum case had been reconstituted, such that injunctive relief was now necessary.</p>\r\n<p>The Barnes plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, including some of the same attorneys as in Bynum, sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. Shortly after filing, they moved for the certification of a two classes: one of people who had been overdetained and another of people who had been been subjected to an illegal strip search.</p>\r\n<p>The District moved to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. That motion was denied on March 26, 2007, by District Judge Royce C. Lamberth. 242 F.R.D. 113. Commenting that the case was \"virtually identical\" to the Bynum case, Judge Lamberth also certified both classes the plaintiffs requested as \"hybrid\" Rule 23(b)(3) classes, which allowed the plaintiffs to pursue both injunctive relief and monetary damages.</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. Following the close of liability discovery, the parties cross-motions for summary judgment were granted in part and denied in part.</p>\r\n<p>On June 24, 2011, Judge Lamberth ruled on both parties' summary judgment motions. He granted the plaintiffs summary judgment on their claims related to the strip searches and on the District&rsquo;s liability for overdetentions from 2005 to 2006. Judge Lamberth granted the District summary judgment on its claims of overdetentions from 2008 to the present. 793 F. Supp. 2d 260 (D.D.C. 2011).</p>\r\n<p>Then, the plaintiffs asked for leave to file another amended complaint. The parties moved again for summary judgement. But on December 7, 2011, the Judge Lamberth held that the court would not grant the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint and that the court would not entertain further motions for summary judgment. Judge Lamberth also addressed additional discovery issues, how the issue of general damages would be tried, and that the class would be decertified to try the issue of special damages. 278 F.R.D. 14 (D.D.C. 2011).</p>\r\n<p>After Judge Lamberth had decertified the special damages class, the plaintiffs had moved to stay the decertification order and to make the stay of decertification order retroactive to date of that order. On February 19, 2013, the Judge Lamberth stayed the decertification order was appropriate, but only as of when the plaintiffs&rsquo; moved for the stay. 924 F. Supp. 2d 103. Leading up to the trial, both parties filed various motions regarding discovery and evidence that the court addressed. 924 F. Supp. 2d 74.</p>\r\n<p>In March 2013, there was a week-long jury trial. Afterward, the District moved for judgment as a matter of law, which was denied. But on March 11, the jury found that the plaintiffs were unconstitutionally overdetained at the D.C. Jail between 2007 and 2008, but that the District wasn't liable; the jury didn't find evidence of \"deliberate indifference\" to the inmates' rights. Because Judge Lamberth had already granted the plaintiffs summary judgment on claims related to the strip searches and on the city's liability for overdetentions from 2005 to 2006, the parties moved for the case to be referred to mediation and the litigation stayed.</p>\r\n<p>On November 4, 2013, the parties reached a settlement agreement, which the Court approved on March 18, 2014. The District agreed to provide monetary compensation for each plaintiff, based on the length of time they were \"overdetained\" and for qualifying strip searches. The District also agreed to pay a total of $6.2 million to the plaintiffs, the class members, and to cover costs and attorney's fees. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>From 2013 to approximately 2019, the parties continued to report to the court on the progress of payments to class members. However, there has been no action on the docket since August of 2019 and the case appears to be closed.</p>",

BACKGROUND \nThis  case  concerns  the  District  of  Columbia  Department  of  Corrections’  (“DOC”) \npractice of overdetaining and strip searching its inmates.  The plaintiffs, former inmates subject \n____________________ \n \n* Following defendant District of Columbia’s Motion to Clarify the Record, Sept. 27, 2012, ECF \nNo. 394, the Court decided to make two non-material changes to clarify the factual record.  See ECF No. \n396.  Those changes are reflected in footnote 11 (page 22 of the ECF version) and Part.III.E. (pp. 24–25). \n\nto  overdetentions  and  strip  searches,  filed  a  class  action  against  the  District  of  Columbia \n(“District”) over six years ago.  Compl., Feb. 23, 2006, ECF No. 1.  This long-running case is \nvirtually identical to a prior case before this Court, Bynum v. District of Columbia, Civil Action \nNo. 02-956 (RCL) (filed in 2002).  Given this extensive history, the Court assumes familiarity \nwith its prior opinions, which set forth the background of this class-action litigation in greater \ndetail.  See, e.g., Barnes v. District of Columbia, 793 F. Supp. 2d 260, 265 (D.D.C. 2011) (ECF \nNo. 307) (discussing background of case up to summary judgment stage).1 \nIn June 2011, the Court granted plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to the \nDistrict of Columbia’s liability for any overdetentions at its jails, throughout the class period, \ncaused by the DOC’s application of the so-called “10 p.m. cut-off” rule, and all overdetentions \noccurring from September 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006.  Id. at 286.  The Court granted the \nDistrict’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to overdetentions occurring from February 26, 2008 \nforward that were not caused by the DOC's enforcement of the 10 p.m. cut-off rule.  Id.  The \nCourt denied both parties’ motions as to the District's liability for overdetentions that occurred \nfrom January 1, 2007 t o February 25, 2008 ( the “disputed” or “Trial Period”) that were not \ncaused by the DOC's enforcement of the 10 p.m. cut-off rule.  Id. at 286 & n.18.  The District’s \nliability for that subset of overdetentions remains undetermined pending trial. \nFollowing these rulings, the Court ordered limited, additional discovery in December \n2011.  See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 278 F.R.D. 14, 18 (D.D.C. 2011) (ECF No. 328).  The \nparties’ competing trial proposals each assumed the need for additional fact and expert discovery \nprior to trying the remaining liability issues, and the Court—responding to and agreeing with the \n                                                           \n1 Considering some of the parties’ current motions—which frequently raise issues that could have \nbeen resolved by carefully reading the prior Orders of this Court—assuming familiarity might be a \nstretch.  The following three paragraphs of this background section are taken, largely, from the Court’s \ndescription in Barnes v. District of Columbia, 281 F.R.D. 53, 53–54 (D.D.C. 2012). \n2 \n \n\nDistrict’s concerns—restricted that discovery “to such...as will assist the parties in determining \nhow many overdetentions occurred during the disputed period.”  Id.  The Court made clear that it \nwould not permit further discovery on “process” and related issues.  Id. at 23.  The Court ordered \nthe parties to update their expert reports by February 10, 2012, and ordered that this additional \ndiscovery period would close on April 6, 2012.  Id. \nBetween  January  13, 2012 a nd  March  6,  2012,  the  District  served  four  sets  of \ninterrogatories and requests for production on plaintiffs, seeking information about plaintiffs’ \ncontentions regarding the number of overdetentions during the Trial Period.  Plaintiffs’ responses \nto two of those sets of interrogatories, as well as the scope of an upcoming deposition of \nplaintiffs’ statistical expert, were in dispute.  These disputes were rooted in a disagreement as to \nthe proper scope of discovery.  The District contended that the only overdetentions that are \nrelevant  to  the  upcoming  liability  trial  are  those  not  caused  by  the  10 p.m .  cut-off  rule.  \nConsequently, the District believed that plaintiffs needed to determine the number of 10 p.m. \ncut-off  rule  overdetentions  during  the  Trial  Period  so  that  those  overdetentions  could  be \nexcluded.  Plaintiffs argued that the plain language of the Court’s December 2011 Order limited \nadditional discovery to the number of overall overdetentions during the Trial Period, without \nspecifying that this number had to exclude overdetentions caused by the 10 p.m. cut-off rule.  \nSee  Barnes  v.  District  of  Columbia,  281 F .R.D.  53,  55  (D.D.C.  2012)  (ECF  No.  336) \n(summarizing parties’ discovery disputes). \nOn  April  3, 2012, t he  Court  resolved  these  discovery  disputes  in  a  Memorandum \nOpinion.2  Barnes, 281 F.R.D. 53.  The Court considered both parties’ positions “substantially \njustified,” id. at 56 n.2, but ultimately agreed “with the District that the purpose of the Court's \n                                                           \n2 The Court will refer to this opinion and order as “April 3rd Discovery Opinion” herein. \n \n3 \n \n\nDecember 2011 discovery Order was to permit the parties to ascertain the number of disputed \noverdetentions during the Trial Period.”  Id. at 55.  To this end, the Court ordered the plaintiffs to \nanswer the District’s Interrogatory 1 (seeking overall number of overdetentions during Trial \nPeriod) and Interrogatory 2 (seeking number of overdetentions during Trial Period caused by 10 \np.m. cut-off rule).  Id.  The Court “recognize[d] that ordering a party to create a document that \ndoesn’t exist or to perform analyses it hasn’t yet performed is somewhat unusual,” but decided: \nIn the circumstances of this case, where plaintiffs’ failure to perform the required \nanalysis would almost certainly result in the exclusion of that key evidence prior \nto trial, and where that analysis can be performed comparatively easily using \ncomputerized data plaintiffs have in their possession, ordering plaintiffs to create \nthe requested information is reasonable. \nId. at 55–56.3  To allow for the completion of this additional analysis, the Court extended \ndiscovery first until April 25, 2012 (Minute Order, Apr. 24, 2012), then until June 11, 2012 \n(Order, Apr. 27, 2012, ECF No. 345), and ultimately until June 14, 2012 (Minute Order, June 12, \n2012).  The plaintiffs filed two supplemental expert reports and one set of errata on June 14, \n2012.  See Sealed Documents, June 14, 2012, ECF No. 360. \n  On May 22, 2012, before the amended discovery deadlines had passed, the District filed a \nMotion  to  Compel  interrogatory  responses  and  preclude  plaintiffs  from  introducing  certain \nevidence.  ECF No. 351.  Upon receipt of the plaintiffs’ supplemental expert reports and errata, \nthe District filed a Motion to Strike the expert reports.  ECF No. 365.   In the alternative, the \nDistrict requested additional time to complete discovery and leave to designate rebuttal experts.  \nId.  These motions are related to one another, and the Court considers them in turn. \n  While creating the supplemental expert reports, the plaintiffs claim that their experts \ndiscovered that the District’s production was incomplete.  The plaintiffs filed, on June 22, 2012, \n                                                           \n3 This Opinion also denied parties’ motions to compel as to several other interrogatories and \noutlined the proper scope of the interrogatory of plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Krieger.  Id. at 55–57. \n4 \n \n\ntheir  Non-Consent  Amended  and  Re-Stated  Motion  to  Compel  Production  of  the  Release \nDiscrepancy Database.  ECF No. 362.  This opinion also resolves this motion. \n \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA.  Motion to Compel \nUnder  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  26(b)(1),  “[p]arties  may  obtain  discovery \nregarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party.”  This \nright is subject to Rule 26(b)(2)(C), which limits discovery that is, inter alia, unreasonably \nduplicative, burdensome, or expensive.  A party may submit to another party interrogatories that \n“relate to any matter that may be inquired into under Rule 26(b).”  F.R.C.P. 33(a). \nWhen a party fails to respond to a proper discovery request or interrogatory, the other \nparty may—after first attempting to resolve the issue by conferring with the other party—file a \nmotion to compel.  F.R.C.P. 37(a)(1).  Courts consider the prior efforts of the parties to resolve \nthe dispute, the relevance of the information sought, and the limits imposed by Rule 26(b)(2)(C) \nwhen deciding whether to grant a motion to compel.  See, e.g., Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. \nSanders, 437 U.S. 340, 350–52 (1978); Harris v. Koenig, 271 F.R.D. 356, 363 (D.D.C. 2010); \nU.S. ex rel. Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment Centers of America, Inc., 235 F.R.D. 521, 529–30 \n(D.D.C. 2006) (Lamberth, J.).  An appellate court will review a district court’s decision whether \nto compel discovery for an abuse of discretion.  See Libscomb v. Winter, 2009 WL 1153442, *1 \n(D.C. Cir Apr. 3, 2009) (affirming district court because “appellant has not shown the district \ncourt  abused  its  discretion  in  denying  his  motion  to  compel  discovery.”).    Courts  may,  if \nappropriate, consider motions to compel filed after discovery has closed.  See Lurie v. Mid-\nAtlantic Permanente Medical Group, P.C., 262 F.R.D. 29, 31 ( D.D.C. 2009) (Lamberth, C.J.) \n(“[C]ourts routinely consider motions related to discovery, even though they are filed outside the \n5 \n \n\ndiscovery period.”). \nInterrogatories, as a part of the discovery process, help litigants prepare for trial by \nnarrowing the issues and determining what evidence they will need at trial.  8b CHARLES ALAN \nWRIGHT, ET AL., FED. PRAC. & PROC. § 2162 (3d ed. 2012).  Parties must answer interrogatories \n“fully” with “true, explicit, responsive, complete and candid” answers.  Equal Rights Ctr. v. Post \nProperties, Inc., 246 F.R.D. 29, 32 (D.D.C. 2007).  “The party objecting to…discovery bears the \nburden of ‘show[ing] why discovery should not be permitted,’” Alexander v. F.B.I., 193 F.R.D. \n1, 3 (D.D.C. 2000) (internal citations omitted), while the party seeking to compel discovery has \nthe burden of proving that a discovery response is inadequate.  Equal Rights Ctr., 246 F.R.D. at \n32.   C ourts  treat  evasive  or  incomplete  answers  to  interrogatories  as  a f ailure  to  respond.  \nF.R.C.P. 37(a)(4). \nB.  Motion to Strike \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), a court may strike all or part of a pleading \nfor  insufficiency,  redundancy,  immateriality,  impertinence,  or  scandalousness.    See  F.R.C.P \n12(f); Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Commerce, 224 F.R.D. 261, 263 (D.D.C. 2004).  Under \nthis Rule, “pleading” encompasses expert reports.  See U.S. ex rel. Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment \nCenters of America, Inc., 474 F. Supp. 2d 75, 79 (D.D.C. 2007) (Lamberth, J.) (providing \nstandard of  review  for  motion to strike expert report, applying 12(f)).  These motions are \nstrongly disfavored, and the decision of whether to strike all or part of a pleading rests within the \nsound discretion of the Court.  See Judicial Watch, 224 F.R.D. at 263 (collecting authorities);    \n2-12 MOORE’S FEDERAL PRACTICE-CIVIL § 12.37 (2006).  A “motion to strike is considered an \nexceptional remedy and is generally disfavored,” Larouche v. Dep’t of the Treasury, 2000 WL \n805214 at *13, (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2000) (citing MOORE’S at § 12.37), and the proponent of such a \n6 \n \n\nmotion must carry a “formidable burden.”  Judicial Watch, 224 F.R.D. at 264. \nDefendant  seeks  to  strike  supplemental  and  amended  expert  reports,  so  the  legal \nstandards for filing and amending expert reports are relevant.  Rule 26(A)(2)(d) states: \nA party must [disclose expert testimony] at the time and in the sequence that the \ncourt orders.  Absent a stipulation or court order, the disclosures must be made: at \nleast 90 days before the date set for trial or for the case to be ready for trial; or if \nthe evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject \nmatter  identified  by  another  party…,  within  30 da ys  after  the  other  party’s \ndisclosure. \n \nF.R.C.P. 26(A)(2)(d) (original formatting omitted).  The Rules further state: \nA party who has made a disclosure under Rule 26(a)…must supplement or correct \nits disclosure or response: in a timely manner if the party learns that in some \nmaterial respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the \nadditional or corrective information had not otherwise been made known to the \nparties during the discovery process or in writing; or as ordered by the court. \n \nF.R.C.P. 26(e) (original formatting omitted).  Courts do not allow supplemental or amended \nreports simply at the whim of a party; they are permitted: “(1) upon court order; (2) when the \nparty learns that the earlier information is inaccurate or incomplete; or (3) when answers to \ndiscovery requests are inaccurate or incomplete.”  Mineba Co., Ltd. v. Papst, 231 F.R.D. 3, 6 \n(D.D.C. 2005) (citing Keener v. United States, 181 F.R.D. 639, 640 (D. Mont. 1998)). \nC.  Extension of Time \nThe Rules provide that “[w]hen an act may or must be done within a specified time, the \ncourt may, for good cause, extend the time: with or without motion or notice if the court acts, or \nif a request is made, before the original time or its extension expires; or on motion made after the \ntime  has  expired  if  the  party  failed  to  act  because  of  excusable  neglect.”   F .R.C.P.  6(b).  \nSpecifically pertaining to scheduling orders, Federal Rule 16(b) and Local Rule 16.4 allow the \nCourt to modify the discovery deadlines of a scheduling order “upon a showing of good cause.”  \nMyrdal v. District of Columbia, 2007 WL 1655875, *2 (D.D.C. June 7, 2012) (Lamberth, J.).  \n7 \n \n\nDeciding whether to extend discovery is within the sound discretion of the trial court.  See, e.g., \nU.S. v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 100 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (“[T]he trial court [has] wide latitude \nto receive evidence as it sees fit.”); Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food and Commercial Workers \nInt’l  Union,  103 F .  3d  1007, 1012 ( D.C.  Cir.  1997)  (“Trial  courts  exercise  considerable \ndiscretion in handling discovery matters[.]”).  In deciding whether good cause exists under Rules \n16(b) and 16.4 to amend a scheduling order, the Court primarily considers the diligence of the \nparty in seeking discovery before the deadline.  See Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., 975 \nF.2d 604, 609 ( 9th Cir. 1992) (“Rule 16(b)'s ‘good cause’ standard primarily considers the \ndiligence of the party seeking the amendment….If the party was not diligent, the inquiry should \nend.”); St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Capitol Sprinkler Inspection, Inc., 2007 WL 1589496, *6 \n(D.D.C. June 1, 2007) (collecting cases, quoting Johnson). \nD.  Leave to Designate Rebuttal Experts \nRule 26(A)(2)(d)(ii) allows a party to designate a rebuttal expert “within 30 days after the \nother party’s disclosure.”  Rebuttal experts are used “solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the \nsame  subject  matter  identified  by  another  party.”    F.R.C.P.  26(A)(2)(d)(ii).    There  is  no \nfreestanding Rule that specifically addresses the designation and disclosure of rebuttal experts \nvis-à-vis supplemental or amended expert reports.  Some Courts have held that, when a party had \npreviously failed to designate a rebuttal expert, that party does not necessarily get another chance \nafter a report is amended.  See Hubbard v. Potter, 247 F.R.D. 27, 31 (D.D.C. 2008) (denying \nmotion to strike supplemental expert report and denying leave to designate rebuttal experts).  \nOther Courts, when faced with a report containing significant changes filed during or near trial, \nhave gone as far as striking the entire supplemental report.  See Minebea, 231 F.R.D. at 6 \n(striking supplemental expert reports submitted during trial). \n8 \n \n\nUltimately, granting leave is within the discretion of the Court.  Rule 26(a)(2)(C) states \nthat “[expert witness] disclosures shall be made at the times and in the sequence directed by the \ncourt.”  From “the language of Rule 26(a)(2)(C), the Court has the authority to control the timing \nand sequence in which expert designations are made” including whether a party can make a \ndesignation of an expert for the purposes of rebuttal.  Estate of Vaughn v. KIA Motors America, \nInc., 2006 WL 1806454, *2 (S.D. Miss. June 29, 2006). \n \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Defendant’s Motion to Compel Answers to Interrogatories No. 1 and 2 \nThe  District’s  current  Motion  to  Compel  relates  to  a  previous  Order  of  the  Court \nresolving several discovery motions.  On April 3, 2012, the Court ruled on two motions by the \ndefendant to compel discovery responses and a motion by the plaintiffs for a protective order.  \nBarnes, 281 F.R.D. 53.  The District challenged plaintiffs’ responses to Interrogatories 1, 2, 5, \nand 6.  Id. at 55.  As previously summarized by the Court: \nInterrogatory No. 1 seeks, in short, the overall number of overdetentions during the \nTrial Period.  Interrogatory No. 2 seeks the number of the overdetentions during \nthe Trial Period that plaintiffs contend were caused by the 10 p.m. cut-off rule.  \nInterrogatory No. 5 seeks the number of overdetentions (the time period is not \nspecified) in which an inmate was sent to the Medical Holding Unit before being \noverdetained.  Interrogatory No. 6 seeks a breakdown (“for all periods at issue”) of \nthe number of inmates who were overdetained for certain lengths of time—“less \nthan 2 hours,” “2 or more hours but less than 4 hours,” and so forth. \n \nId. (citations omitted).  This Court denied defendant’s motion to compel as to Interrogatories 5 \nand 6, id. at 56, but granted the motion4 as to Interrogatories 1 and 2.  Id. at 55.  To this end: \n[T]he Court will order plaintiffs to revise their responses to Interrogatories Nos. 1 \n                                                           \n4 With limitations.  This Court did not grant “the District's request in Interrogatory No. 1 for the \noverdetention figures to be broken down into “CRER” and “non-CRER” overdetentions.” 281 F.R.D. at \n56.  “CRER” stands for “Court Return Entitled to Release” and “indicates an inmate who left the DOC’s \ncorrectional facilities to attend a court hearing and who was entitled to be released upon his or her return \nto jail.”  Id. at 56 n.1. \n9 \n \n\nand 2 by stating how many overdetentions they contend occurred during the Trial \nPeriod  (excluding  from  that  number  the  number  of  overdetentions  that  they \ncontend were caused by the DOC’s enforcement of the 10 p.m. cut-off rule) and \nalso  by  stating  how  many  10  p.m.  cut-off  rule  overdetentions  they  contend \noccurred during the Trial Period.  As requested by the District, plaintiffs must also \nexplain in full in their responses how they arrived at these figures.  The Court \nrecognizes that ordering a party to create a document that doesn’t exist or to \nperform  analyses  it  hasn’t  yet  performed  is  somewhat  unusual….In  the \ncircumstances  of  this  case,  where  plaintiffs’  failure  to  perform  the  required \nanalysis would almost certainly result in the exclusion of that key evidence prior \nto trial, and where that analysis can be performed comparatively easily using \ncomputerized data plaintiffs have in their possession, ordering plaintiffs to create \nthe requested information is reasonable. \nId. at 55–56.  In their present motion, the District claims—despite the Court’s April 3rd Order—\nthat it still has not received satisfactory responses to Interrogatories 1 and 2.  Def.’s Mem. ISO \nits Mot. to Compel 2–3, May 22, 2012, ECF No. 351. \n  The Court’s December 2011 Trial Plan opened a period of limited discovery to close on \nApril 6, 2012.  Barnes, 278 F.R.D. at 18.  After this Court issued its April 3rd Discovery Opinion, \nthe  parties  each  moved  to  extend  the  discovery  deadline  to  accommodate  the  discovery \ncompelled by the Order.  See ECF docket entries 337, 338, 339, 343.   On April 27, 2012 this \nCourt resolved those motions and set the deadline for extended discovery for June 11, 2012, \nadding:  “[T]he Court shall permit the District to depose both [plaintiffs’ experts] Dr. Kriegler \nand Mr. Day, at its option.  No further extensions of discovery will be permitted.”  ECF No. 345.  \nOn June 12, 2012, the Court issued a Minute Order granting an additional extension of time, \nordering the plaintiffs to “produce the [expert] reports and all related discoverable material no \nlater than 12:00 AM on Thursday June 14, 2012.”  On June 14, 2012, the plaintiffs submitted \ntheir supplemental expert reports per the Court’s Order.  See ECF No. 360. \n  When granting defendant’s earlier motion to compel as to Interrogatories 1 and 2, this \nCourt expected that the answers may come via supplemental expert reports.  This Court carefully \nconsidered the appropriateness of ordering plaintiffs to create new documents or perform new \n10 \n \n\nanalyses, and ultimately decided that so ordering was “reasonable.”  281 F.R.D. at 55–56.  The \nCourt  extended  discovery  so  plaintiffs  could  respond  to  Interrogatories  1  and  2  with \nsupplemental reports identifying the requested information and explaining their methodologies.  \nThe District may have misunderstood the Court’s April 3rd Discovery Opinion, because on May \n22, 2012 it filed a renewed motion to compel.  At that time, the plaintiffs had until June 11, 2012 \nto file reports answering the interrogatories.  Therefore, the District’s May 22nd motion to compel \nwas premature; the plaintiffs still had time to file their responses. \n  In  any  event,  the  plaintiffs  timely  filed  expert  reports  aimed  at  clearly  and  fully \nanswering Interrogatories 1 and 2.  Supplemental Report of Sean R. Day, June 14, 2012, ECF \nNo. 360-2; Third Supplemental Expert Report of Brian Kriegler, Ph.D., June 14, 2012, ECF No. \n360-3.  When these reports came in, the defendant filed a Motion to Strike; the Court declines to \nstrike these reports, for the reasons discussed in Part III.C. infra.  The defendant may dispute the \naccuracy and methodologies of the reports, and they are free to do via deposition.  However, \nplaintiffs  answered  Interrogatories  1  and  2 i n  the  manner  and  time  allowed  by  the  Court.  \nTherefore, the defendant’s Motion to Compel as to Interrogatories 1 and 2 is denied. \nB.  Defendant’s Motion to Compel Answer to Interrogatory No. 13 \nThe District also seeks to compel plaintiffs to answer Interrogatory 13, which reads: \nPlease identify each fact witness (by name, address at which the person can be \nserved a deposition notice such as a home address, phone number, and social \nsecurity number) you intend to call during the liability phase of the trial and also \nplease state each fact you expect the witness to testify to. \n \nDef.’s Fourth Set of Interrogs. & Req. for Produc. of Docs. 5, Mar. 6, 2012, ECF No. \n351-1.  The plaintiffs responded: \nPlaintiffs have not yet had an opportunity to revise their trial strategy in response \nto the Discovery Revision Order [docket # 336] and so plaintiffs reserve the right \nto supplement its responses but at this point plaintiffs reserve the right to call all \n11 \n \n\nfact  witnesses  on  the  defendant’s  responses  to  plaintiffs  [sic]  interrogatories.  \nPlaintiffs will state (subjection [sic] to objections provided by the rules and other \nlaw) “each fact you expect the witness to testify to” when the District responds to \nplaintiffs’ interrogatory and tells plaintiffs what those facts are. \n \nPls.’ Resp. to Def.’s Fourth Set of Doc. Prodc. Req. 1, Apr. 25, 2012, ECF No. 351-2.  The \nplaintiffs then listed two witnesses, Razina Jones and Judith Jamison, and indicated that these \nwitnesses “may be contacted through plaintiffs’ counsel.”  Id. at 2. \n  As with the dispute over Interrogatories 1 and 2, the dispute over Interrogatory 13 relates \nto another discovery ruling of the Court.  When the District filed its Motion to Compel, the \nplaintiffs had a similar motion pending.  On April 16, 2012, t he plaintiffs filed a Motion to \nCompel Responses to Plaintiffs’ 2-10-12 Liability Interrogatories and Document Production \nRequests  to Defendant.  ECF No.  341.   In this motion, plaintiffs sought an  answer to an \ninterrogatory virtually identical to the District’s Interrogatory No. 13.  The plaintiffs submitted: \nPlease identify (by name, address at which the person can be served a deposition \nsubpoena such as a home address, phone number, and social security number) \neach fact witness whom you intend to call at trial and also please state each fact \nyou expect the witness to testify to. \n \nSee Pls.’ Mot. to Compel Resp. to its 2-10-12 Interrogs. 3.  To the plaintiffs’ interrogatory, the \nDistrict replied generally: \nThe District objects to the extent that this Interrogatory seeks to replace, expand, \nor preempt the deadlines set by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the \nOrders of this Court.  The District objects to the extent the information sought is \nunduly invasive of the privacy of witnesses who will willingly appear as current \nemployees of the District, and affirmatively states that, where applicable, such \nwitnesses  may  be  deposed  through  arrangement  with  District  counsel.   T he \nDistrict objects that the requested recitation of “each fact” to be attested to in \nevidence at trial in this class action involving thousands of detainees would be \nunduly burdensome and vexatious. \n \nSee id.  Subject to objections, the District provided responses for ten witness; some examples: \nJeanette Myrick: Ms. Myrick can be reached through counsel for the District for \nthe purposes of a deposition.  Ms. Myrick will testify regarding DOC Records \n12 \n \n\nOffice procedures, including staffing and training; the inmate-release process; and \ndiscrepancy reports. . . . \n \nSean  Day:  Mr.  Day  is  an  expert  retained  by  Plaintiffs  and  whose  contact \ninformation is already in Plaintiffs’ possession.  Mr. Day will testify regarding the \nmethods he used to evaluate inmate jackets and prepare the data that was used by \nDr. Kriegler in his expert reports. \n \nId. at 3–4.  Plaintiffs argued that these responses were deficient because the District “stated the \nnames of witnesses and the topics they would testify to but not ‘each fact you expect the witness \nto testify to.’”  Id. at 5. \n  On June 12, 2012—after the District filed its present Motion to Compel—this Court ruled \non the plaintiffs’ motion.  This Court stated: \n[T]he plaintiffs’ interrogatory asks for “each fact that each witness would testify \nto.”   T he  Court  agrees  with  Defendant  to  an  extent:  this  is  a  step  too  far.  \nProviding  a  complete  answer  to  this  interrogatory  would  be  impossible.  \nHowever,  defendant’s  other  objection—that  they  could  not  answer  such  a \nquestion  because  they  have  not  prepared  their  witnesses—is  nonsensical.  \nDefendant provided the names of their witnesses to plaintiffs presumably because \nthe defense intends to call these witnesses at trial.  Defendant must have some \nunderstanding of their own witnesses’ testimony.  Otherwise, naming them as \nwitnesses would be both foolish and illogical….[D]efendant is ordered to provide \na summary of the likely testimony of each of the ten witnesses it named in its \nresponse to plaintiffs’ interrogatory[.] \n \nBarnes v. District of Columbia, 2012 WL 3105218, *4 (D.D.C. June 12, 2012) (ECF No. 358). \n  If the plaintiffs thought the District’s responses were deficient, surely they thought their \nresponses were no better.  The plaintiffs did not even attempt a brief summary of the facts to \nwhich each witness would attest.  They did not include their two experts, who they concede will \ntestify at trial.  See Pls.’ Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Compel 9, June 8, 2012, ECF No. 354.  Instead, \nthey simply referred to the witnesses’ previous affidavits and interrogatory responses in their \nopposition papers.  Id. at Exs. 1, 2.  Basically, the plaintiffs played a game of discovery chicken, \nrefusing to detail their witnesses until the District did the same.  However, a party “is not \n13 \n \n\njustified  in  providing  insufficient  answers  just  because  [the  other  party]  did.”    Covad \nCommunications Co. v. Revonet, Inc., 258 F.R.D. 17, 24 (D.D.C. 2009). \n  The Court understands that the parties may try to gain a competitive advantage through \ngaming the discovery process.  Such strategic maneuvers can cause headaches for courts, as they \ntrudge through multiple discovery motions with no real issues in dispute.  The parties drag their \nfeet until prodded, hoping to gain an upper hand through delay.  Plaintiffs had previously filed a \nmotion to compel on a nearly identical question.  Plaintiffs provided answers even less detailed \nthan  the  defendant’s,  and  even  admit  that  they  are  waiting  until  “the  District  responds  to \nplaintiffs’ pending interrogatory.”  Pls.’ Resp. to Def.’s Fourth Set of Doc. Prodc. Req. 1.  The \nCourt reminds plaintiffs that  Federal Rule 37  gives the Court “broad discretion to impose \nsanctions for discovery violations.”  Bonds v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 801, 807 (D.C. Cir. \n1996) (citing National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 638, 642–43 \n(1976) (per curiam)); see also D.L. v. District of Columbia, 274 F.R.D. 320, 324–26 (D.D.C. \n2011) (Lamberth, C.J.) (explaining wide discretion of trial courts to impose wide variety of \nsanctions).  This case has been going on for over six years.  The plaintiffs refused to do \nsomething they wanted the Court to demand the District to do.  Discovery, at least for the \nliability phase, is nearing the finish line.  If the plaintiffs persist in needlessly gumming up the \nprocess, sanctions—not a further warning—may be appropriate. \n  The plaintiffs are ordered to provide a narrative response to Interrogatory 13.  The Court \nrequires plaintiffs to answer the question in the same manner, and with the same level of detail, \nas the Court ordered the District.  If the plaintiffs have any questions about what the Court \nrequires, they may look at the Court’s June 12, 2012 Memorandum and Order, in particular the \nlanguage block-quoted above.  See Barnes, 2012 WL 3105218, *4. \n14 \n \n\nC.  Defendant’s Motion to Preclude Plaintiffs from Using Certain Evidence \nThe District also requests, within the motion to compel discussed above, that the Court \npreclude the plaintiffs from “using their experts’ reports or testimony at trial.”  Def.’s Mem. ISO \nits Mot. to Compel 5.  The District claims that the plaintiffs’ failure “fully to answer Defendant’s \nInterrogatory No. 13 and timely supplement their expert reports deprives the District of the \nchance to adequately test plaintiffs’ experts’ conclusions and prejudices the District’s defense of \nthis case.”  Id.  See also Williams v. Johnson, 278 F.R.D. 10, 14 (D.D.C. 2011) (“[T]he sanction \nis automatic; ‘[i]f a party fails to provide information…as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party \nis not allowed to use that information…to supply evidence…at trial, unless the failure was \nsubstantially justified or harmless.”) (quoting F.R.C.P. 37(c)(1)).  However, for the reasons \ndiscussed regarding the District’s Motion to Strike infra, the Court does not agree with the \nDistrict’s assertion that plaintiffs’ experts were “lying in wait to express new opinions at the last \nminute.”  Def.’s Mem. ISO its Mot. to Compel 5 n.3 (quoting Iacangelo v. Georgetown Univ., \n272 F.R.D. 233, 234 (D.D.C. 2011)).  The plaintiffs’ experts filed their reports within the time \nallotted by this Court.  Therefore, there is no need to preclude the plaintiffs from introducing this \nevidence.  Cf. Dormu v. District of Columbia, 795 F. Supp. 2d 7, 28 n.16 (D.D.C. 2011) (denying \nmotion to strike supplemental expert report when report filed “several months prior to trial, \nleaving defendants with sufficient time to adjust their trial preparation….Any harm they do \nexperience, however, can be minimized by allowing defendants to depose the expert if they so \nchoose.”) (citing Albert v. Warner-Lambert Co., 2002 WL 745822, *1 (D. Mass. Apr. 24, 2002) \n(“[I]n lieu of preclusion, the court will allow [the expert] to supplement his report contingent \nupon his being made available for up to four hours of additional direct deposition testimony at \n[plaintiff’s] expense.”)). \n15 \n \n\nD.  Defendant’s Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Expert Reports \nAs discussed in Part III.A. supra, the Court had directed the plaintiffs to respond to the \nDistrict’s Interrogatories 1 and 2 (requesting information about number of overdetentions during \nthe trial period and overdetentions attributable to the 10 p.m. cut-off rule).  The Court took the \nsomewhat unusual move of ordering the plaintiffs to produce new documents in response to the \ninterrogatories.  Barnes, 281 F.R.D. at 55–56.  At that time, the Court expected the answers to \ncome in the form of supplemental expert reports estimating the number of overdetentions and \nexplaining the reasoning behind those numbers.  To permit the production of these reports, the \nCourt  reopened  discovery  until  June  11, 2012, E CF  No.  345, a nd  ultimately  extended  the \ndeadline via Minute Order to June 14.  B y the amended deadline, the plaintiffs filed their \namended expert reports answering Interrogatories 1 and 2.  See ECF No. 360. \nWhen the District received these reports, instead of withdrawing their now-moot Motion \nto Compel answers to Interrogatories 1 and 2, it responded with a Motion to Strike, Or, In the \nAlternative, For Extension of Time and Leave to Designate Rebuttal Expert(s), June 29, 2012, \nECF No. 365.  The District claims that the “latest expert reports radically alter their analysis and \nvastly increase their estimates of overdetentions in the Trial Period,” and characterize the reports \nas eleventh hour filings.  Def.’s Mem. ISO its Mot. to Strike 1, 5.  The District asks the Court to \nstrike the amended expert reports.  In the alternative, the District asks the Court to extend \ndiscovery for at least 74 days to allow the District to analyze the new reports and depose Dr. \nKriegler and Mr. Day, the plaintiffs’ experts.  The District also requests leave to designate \npotential rebuttal experts.  Id. at 12. \nThis is another example of the District apparently misunderstanding this Court’s April 3rd \nDiscovery Opinion.  In support of its Motion to Strike, the District dismissively states that \n16 \n \n\n“plaintiffs had already asserted on multiple occasions that answering [Interrogatories 1 and 2] \nwould require not just a supplemental discovery response, but for them to ‘create documents that \ndid not exist’ and consult with their experts.”  Id. at 3.  The language the District quotes, \nhowever, originates from the Court—not the plaintiffs.  In its April 3rd Discovery Opinion, the \nCourt stated, “The Court recognizes that ordering a party to create a document that doesn’t exist \nor to perform analyses it hasn’t yet performed is somewhat unusual…[yet] ordering plaintiffs to \ncreate the requested information is reasonable.”  Barnes, 281 F.R.D. at 55–56 (emphasis added).  \nThere can be no undue surprise that this information was coming because it was what the Court \nhad ordered.5  Between this Motion to Strike and the premature May 22 Motion to Compel \nresponses to Interrogatories 1 and 2, it seems that the District failed to examine or understand the \nCourt’s April 3rd Discovery Opinion.  The Court urges the District to study this Court’s previous \norders before filing additional motions. \nIt also seems that the District failed to examine or understand other orders of this Court.  \nThe District complains that the expert reports came “literally on the last day of discovery,” and \ntherefore caused undue surprise.  Def.’s Mem. ISO its Mot. to Strike 5.  The plaintiffs filed their \nexpert reports on June 14, 2012—the deadline established by the Court.  The defendant seems to \nthink that the June 14th deadline applied to all aspects of the additional discovery, including the \ndepositions of the experts based on the supplemental expert reports.  Def.’s Mem. ISO its Mot. to \nStrike 4–6, 10–12.  The District characterizes the plaintiffs as “lying in wait” and “sandbagging \n[the District] with three new expert reports.”  Id. at 11.   \nIf the District had just read the Court’s orders extending time, it could have refrained \n                                                           \n5 The District objects to the form of the plaintiffs’ answer.  Def.’s Mem. ISO its Mot. to Strike 2 \nn.3.  However, the plaintiffs answered this way because they were directed to do so by the Court’s April \n3rd Discovery Opinion.  281 F.R.D. at 55–56.  The District is not entitled to dictate the form of the \nplaintiffs’ response.  Huthnance v. District of Columbia, 255 F.R.D. 297, 300 (D.D.C. 2008). \n17 \n \n\nfrom such dramatic language and taken a more measured approach.  In their April 23, 2012 \nMotion for a Nunc Pro Tunc Extension of All Discovery Deadlines, ECF No. 343, the plaintiffs \nstated:  “Plaintiffs now estimate that it will take until Monday, June 11, 2012 for Mr. Day to \ncomplete his investigation and analysis and to pass them on to Dr. Kriegler, and then for Dr. \nKriegler to complete his investigation and analysis, and for both to complete and finalize their \nreports.”    Id.  at  6.  O n  April  27, 2012, t he  Court  granted  plaintiffs’  motion,  ordering:  \n“Specifically, the discovery deadlines in this case are hereby extended until Monday, June 11, \n2012.  Furthermore, the Court shall permit the District to depose both Dr. Kriegler and Mr. Day, \nat its option.”  ECF No. 345.  On June 12, 2012, the Court entered a Minute Order “granting \n[plaintiffs’] Motion for Extension of Time to produce plaintiffs’ experts’ reports.”  The Order \ncontinued:  “Plaintiffs are ordered to produce the reports and all related discoverable material no \nlater than 12:00 AM on Thursday June 14, 2012.”  From these filings, it should have been \napparent to the District that it would receive the expert reports on the day of the deadline. \nThe Court understands that there might have been some ambiguity in its April 27th Order.  \nThe  Court  extended  “the  discovery  deadlines  in  this  case…until  Monday,  June  11, 2012,”  \nallowed “the District to depose both Dr. Kriegler and Mr. Day, at its option,” but stated that \n“[n]o further extensions of discovery will be permitted.”  ECF No. 345.  By this, the Court meant \nthat the District could depose the experts, at its option, after it received the reports.  These \ndepositions need not occur before June 11, as the Court considered the leave to take depositions \nan  additional  extension  of  discovery,  beyond  which  “[n]o  further  extensions….[would]  be \npermitted.”  Id.  When the District received the reports on June 14, rather than asking the Court \nto clarify its April 27th Order to determine when and whether it could depose plaintiffs’ experts,6 \n                                                           \n6 Although no Federal Rule of Civil Procedure specifically governs “motions for clarification,” \nthese motions are generally recognized and allowed by federal courts.  See U.S. v. Phillip Morris USA \n18 \n \n\nit cranked the dial up to eleven and filed a Motion to Strike. \nThe District claims that the supplemental reports depart so dramatically from the previous \nreports that the Court cannot consider them mere updates and must strike them.  Def.’s Mem. \nISO its Mot. to Strike 6.  The District relies on Mineba v. Papst, 231 F.R.D. 3 at 6, wherein the \nCourt struck an amended expert report where “[t]he nature of the second disclosure [was] so \nsubstantially different from the first that it [fell] far outside any reasonable notion of correcting \nan incomplete or inaccurate report.”  Mineba concerned an attempt by a party to amend their \nexpert report during trial.  Id.  The Mineba opinion states that “[t]he purpose of Rule 26(a)(2) \n[governing timing of expert disclosures] is to prevent unfair surprise at trial.”  Id. at 5–6.  \nAlthough this Court wants to finish discovery and proceed to trial as soon as possible, it has not \nyet set a trial date.  Another case relied on by the District, Coles v. Perry, 217 F.R.D. 1, 4 \n(D.D.C. 2003), concerns an attempt by an expert to supplement his report after the close of \ndiscovery.7  In the present case, plaintiffs filed their reports during the window of additional \ndiscovery set aside for this purpose.  The supplemental reports were filed “as ordered by the \ncourt,” F.R.C.P. 26(e)(1)(B), by its April 3rd Discovery Opinion directing plaintiffs to create \ndocuments responsive to Interrogatories 1 and 2.  Barnes, 281 F.R.D. at 55–56.  The plaintiffs \nfiled Errata to the Second Supplemental Expert Report, ECF No. 360-3, to correct an incomplete \nor incorrect prior report, per Rule 26(e)(1)(A). \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nInc., 793 F. Supp. 2d 164, 168–69 (D.D.C. 2011) (explaining motions for clarification).  “The general \npurpose of” a classic “motion for clarification is to explain or clarify something ambiguous or vague[.]”  \nResolution Trust Corp. v. KPMG Peat Marwick, et al., 1993 WL 211555, *2 (E.D. Pa. June 8, 1993). \n \n7 A third case relied on by the District, U.S. ex rel. Purcell v. MWI Corp., 824 F. Supp. 2d 12, 19 \n(D.D.C. 2011) did not concern the filing of supplemental expert reports.  Rather, “the defendant failed to \ndisclose two  of its  witnesses”  at  all  during  discovery,  and  for that reason  the  Court  granted  “the \ngovernment’s motion to strike those witnesses’ declarations.”  Id. at 12.  While this opinion contains \nstrong passages that sound good for the District, the facts are dissimilar.  Here, the plaintiffs submitted \nsupplemental reports—written by experts whom have already been disclosed—pursuant to a Court order.  \nThis is very different from springing two entirely new witnesses on a party. \n \n19 \n \n\nMotions to strike are strongly disfavored, and the decision of whether to strike all or part \nof a pleading or attachment thereto rests within the sound discretion of the Court.  See supra \nPart.II.B. (collecting cases).  As detailed in Part III.D infra, while the Court concedes that the \nsupplemental reports are different from the prior reports, the Court does not see the changes as so \ndramatic and prejudicial to the District as to warrant striking the reports.  When considering \nstrong sanctions a Court must consider less strict options.  Bonds, 93 F.3d at 808.  To the extent \nthe supplemental reports introduce new issues, the Court can minimize any prejudice to the \nDistrict through less severe means.  If parts of the plaintiffs’ new reports contain irrelevant \ninformation, the Court may consider narrower motions to strike or in limine directed at removing \nonly the irrelevant passages.  Moreover, allowing the District to depose the plaintiffs’ experts \nensures the District a fair opportunity to respond to the plaintiffs’ reports. \nThe Rules require that parties disclose their expert reports “at the times and in the \nsequence that the Court orders.”  F.R.C.P. 26(a)(2)(D).  That is what the plaintiffs did.8  Pursuant \nto the Court’s April 3rd Discovery Opinion and subsequent extensions for time, the plaintiffs \nfiled supplemental expert reports answering defendant’s Interrogatories 1 and 2.  T he Court \nreopened discovery for this purpose and the plaintiffs filed those reports within that window.  \nSince the plaintiffs followed the Court’s order and timely filed their supplemental expert reports, \nthe Court will not strike them. \n                                                           \n8 The plaintiffs supplemented their expert reports under Rule 26(e)(1)(B), pursuant to this Court’s \nApril 3rd Discovery Opinion and subsequent extension orders.  Therefore, the Court does not need to \nconsider the requirements of Rule 26(e)(1)(A), which some Courts have read more narrowly.  See Keener, \n181 F.R.D. at 640 (limiting supplementation under 26(e)(1)(A) to “correcting inaccuracies, or filling the \ninterstices of an incomplete report based upon information that was not available at the time of the initial \ndisclosure.”).  In the course of preparing these supplemental reports, the plaintiffs revisited and revised an \nearlier report and filed errata thereto.  The plaintiffs did not revisit the earlier report sua sponte but \ndiscovered the inaccuracies as they prepared the reports ordered by this Court.  Therefore, this Court finds \nthat this errata filing was proper under Rule 26(e)(1)(A), as the plaintiffs “learn[ed] that in some material \nrespect the [earlier] disclosure or response [was] incomplete or incorrect” and the Court believes that the \nplaintiffs provided corrections in a timely manner after learning of the need for them. \n \n20 \n \n\nE.  Defendant’s Motion to Extend and Grant Leave to Designate Rebuttal Experts \nThis Court has noted that it would give the District an opportunity to depose plaintiffs’ \nexperts Dr. Krieger and Mr. Day after the District received the supplemental expert reports.  See \nOrder, Apr. 17, 2012, ECF No. 345 (“[T]he Court shall permit the District to depose both Dr. \nKriegler and Mr. Day, at its option.”).  Now that the plaintiffs have submitted their expert \nreports, the Court will reopen discovery for the limited purpose of allowing the District to depose \nplaintiffs’ experts.  The Court does not believe it needs to reopen discovery for the full 74 days \nrequested by the District.9  See Def.’s Mem. ISO its Mot. to Strike 12.  The District has had the \nexpert reports for almost three months and has reviewed them when drafting its Motion to Strike \nand Reply in support thereto.  Therefore, the Court will reopen discovery for 28 days for the sole \npurpose of allowing the District to depose Dr. Kriegler and Mr. Day on issues relating to the \nexpert reports they filed on June 14, 2012, and other matters as allowed by the prior orders of \nthis Court.10  \nThe Court will not reopen discovery to allow the District to designate rebuttal experts.  \nWhile the Rules allow a party to designate a rebuttal expert within 30 days of receiving an \nopposing party’s expert disclosure, F.R.C.P. 26(A)(2)(d)(ii), there is no separate rule conferring a \nright to designate a rebuttal expert upon receiving a supplemental or amended report from a \npreviously-disclosed expert.  The Court could reopen discovery and grant leave upon a showing \nof good cause, as permitted by Federal Rule 16(b) and Local Rule 16.4.  A district court has \nconsiderable discretion in handling discovery and expert witnesses.  See Food Lion, 104 F.3d at \n                                                           \n9 In  a  bold  move,  the  District  states  it  needs  “at  the  very  least,  60  days  to  analyze”  the \nsupplemental reports.  Def.’s Mem. ISO its Mot. to Strike 12.  To put this in context, this is twice the \nlength that Rule 26(A)(2)(d)(ii) would allow the District to designate a rebuttal expert after receiving an \ninitial expert disclosure. \n \n10 For example, in its April 3rd Discovery Opinion, the Court clarified the permissible scope of the \nDistrict’s deposition of Dr. Kriegler.  Barnes, 281 F.R.D. at 57.  The parties are urged to review the prior \norders of this Court before filing any additional motions to compel or motions for protective orders. \n21 \n \n\n1012; F.R.C.P. 26(a)(2)(C). \nThe deadline for discovery—save for the allowance to depose plaintiffs’ experts—has \npassed.  The Court agrees with the plaintiffs that this request falls under Rule 16(b)—not Rule \n6(b)—because it asks to modify the discovery deadlines contained in a scheduling order.  See \nBarnes, 278 F.R.D. at 18 (establishing trial plan); Myrdal, 2007 WL 1655875, *2 (applying \n16(b) to request to change discovery deadlines); Mercury Ins., 2007 WL 1589495, *6 (“Filing an \nexpert disclosure or a supplement thereto after the close of discovery requires leave of the Court \npursuant to [F.R.C.P.] 16(b).”).  Therefore, the District’s request requires a showing that good \ncause exists to reopen and extend discovery, and the Rules give the Court considerable discretion \nin deciding whether to grant that request.  See Myrdal, 2007 WL 1655875, *2. \nThere is no good cause where the District passed on several opportunities to timely \ndesignate a rebuttal expert.  See Johnson., 975 F.2d at 609 (“Rule 16(b)’s ‘good cause’ standard \nprimarily considers the diligence of the party seeking the amendment[.]”).  On March 6, 2010, \nthe District received Mr. Day’s first report on his review of inmate jackets.11  Def.’s Reply ISO \nits Mot. to Strike 2, Aug. 15, 2012, ECF No. 381.  The District did not then designate a rebuttal \nexpert.   O n  November  15, 2010, D r.  Kriegler  released  his  first  expert  report,  estimating \noverdetentions based on a stratified random sample of inmate jackets provided by Mr. Day.  Id. \nat 2–3.  The District did not then designate a rebuttal expert.  On December 2, 2010, Dr. Kriegler \nrevised the numbers in his first expert report.  Id. at 3.   The District did not then designate a \nrebuttal expert.  On December 13, 2010, Mr. Day filed a supplemental report based on additional \n                                                           \n11 An “inmate jacket” is a term referring to the inmate’s physical file, which includes information \nabout the inmate’s term of sentence and time of release.  The District also maintained an electronic \ndatabase of inmate information, known as “JACCS,” that was supposed to compile the information \ncontained  in  the  jackets.    Starting  in  January  2007,  the  District  began  systematically  tracking \noverdetentions through the production of Discrepancy Reports.  The District did not produce these \nDiscrepancy Reports to the Court until June 2011.  For a more thorough discussion of how the District \nand plaintiffs determined and tracked overdetentions, see Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 265–72. \n22 \n \n\nreviews of jackets.  Id. at 4.  The District did not then designate a rebuttal expert.  A day later, \nDr. Kriegler again revised his first report based on Mr. Day’s new report.  Id.  The District did \nnot then designate a rebuttal expert.  On December 7, 2011, the Court reopened limited discovery \nuntil April 6, 2012; on February 14, 2012 Dr. Kriegler filed his Second Supplemental Report.  Id. \nat 4–5.  The District did not then designate a rebuttal expert.  From April 3, 2012 onwards, the \nCourt extended discovery, eventually setting the deadline for plaintiffs’ supplemental expert \nreports for June 14, 2012.  Id. at 5.  The District did not then designate a rebuttal expert.  At no \ntime, in the almost two years since receiving the first report, did the District feel the need to \ndesignate a rebuttal expert.  It is only now, after all the extended deadlines have passed and the \nCourt has stated that “[n]o further extensions of discovery will be permitted,” Order, Apr. 27, \n2012, ECF No. 345, that the District decides it might need an expert witness to rebut Mr. Day \nand Dr. Kriegler’s reports. \nIf the plaintiffs submitted reports vastly different from their original reports, then the \nDistrict might need another opportunity to designate a rebuttal expert.  Therefore, the Court must \nexamine the supplemental reports and determine how they differ from the original reports.  First, \nbear in mind that the plaintiffs created the supplemental reports at the direction of the Court.  \nAfter summary judgment, only a subset of the facts remained in dispute.  The Court—so the \nplaintiffs could respond to interrogatories posed by the District—asked the plaintiffs to revise \ntheir data to focus only on the overdetentions in dispute.  Barnes, 281 F.R.D. at 55–56.  The \nCourt understood that this might require additional analysis on the behalf of the plaintiffs’ \nexperts, and communicated as much in its April 3rd Discovery Opinion.  Id.  The District should \nhave known such analysis was forthcoming, so it cannot claim shock when plaintiffs produced \nwhat they were asked to produce. \n23 \n \n\nThe District claims that the supplemental reports represent “an entirely new analysis—\nindependent of both methodologies used in Dr. Kriegler’s 2nd Report” and estimate a number of \noverdetentions during the Trial Period “almost one third greater than Dr. Kriegler’s previous \nestimate.”  Def.’s Mem. ISO its Mot. to Strike 3–4 (original formatting omitted).  In particular, \nthe District claims that Dr. Kriegler’s Third Supplemental Report uses different data sources (the \nDistrict’s Discrepancy Reports instead of statistically sampled jacket data), employs different \nstatistical methods (simple random sampling instead of stratified random sampling), and comes \nto different results (estimating 1,543 overdetentions instead of 1,180).  Id. at 6–7.  The District \nclaims that Mr. Day’s June 11th report differs from his previous report because it “involves the \nreview of  entries  from a ‘Review Spreadsheet’ created by Dr. Kriegler from the District’s \nRelease  Discrepancy  Database”  instead  of  “reviewing  [a]  random,  statistically-selected \nassortment of inmate jackets.”  Id. at 8.  The District claims that Dr. Kriegler’s Errata to his \nSecond  Report  simply  revises  the  numbers  upwards  without  any  “justification  for  this \ncorrection.”  Id. at 9. \nThe plaintiffs respond that these changes were justified and, in any event, do not require \nthe District to designate a rebuttal expert.  The plaintiffs state that their reports were not prepared \non a whim, but pursuant to Court order.  Pls.’ Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Strike 16–17, Aug. 8, \n2012, ECF No. 378.  They mention that after the plaintiffs told the Court and the District that \nthey anticipated the need to do additional analysis, “the District’s only response was to ask for \nleave to depose Mr. Day…[and] Dr. Kriegler upon receipt of their supplemental reports.”  Id. at \n19.  The plaintiffs contend that Mr. Day had previously analyzed the District Audit Analysis, \nwhich  is  “virtually  identical  in  design  and  content  to  the  Release  Discrepancy  Database” \nanalyzed in Mr. Day’s June 2012 report.  Id. at 20.  The District did not produce its Discrepancy \n24 \n \n\nReports to the Court until June 2011.  Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 270.  The change in data \nsources, plaintiffs allege, reflects newly produced data that allows plaintiffs to separate out \noverdetentions attributable to the 10 pm cut-off rule more accurately; but Mr. Day did not change \nhow he reviewed the data.  Pls.’ Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Strike 26–32.  The plaintiffs explain in \ndetail the reasons why Dr. Kriegler shifted from a stratified random sample in his Second Report \nto a simple random sample in his Third Report.  See id. at 43–45.  Regardless of the particulars \nof why they made the change, plaintiffs state: \nThe District does not state why adding a simple random sample of a stratified \nrandom sample instead of a stratified random sample…makes the analysis so \nnovel that it requires an expert to understand it where before the District did not \ndesignate an expert.  Arguably, if the type of statistical analysis used in the Third \nSupplemental Report were more complicated than the type of analysis used in the \nOriginal Report and Second Supplemental Report, then this might support the \nDistrict’s claim to need an expert now where it did not before.  But the opposite is \ntrue—a statistical analysis using a stratified random sampling design is much \nmore complex than one using a simple random sample[.] \n \nId. at 42–43.  This is perhaps the plaintiffs’ most compelling argument. \nIn essence, the District’s argument is that the supplemental expert reports and errata are \ndifferent.   S tratified  random  sampling  is  different  from  simple  random  sampling;  the \nDiscrepancy Reports are different from jackets; 1,180 is different from 1,543.  What the District \nfails to explain, however, is how these differences relate to its request to potentially designate \nrebuttal experts.  From its previous inaction, the Court assumes that the District was perfectly \nfine going into trial without a rebuttal expert when Dr. Kriegler’s report used stratified random \nsampling.  The District does not explain how the differences change the game—how the methods \nand data sources used are different such that the District did not need a rebuttal expert before, but \nmay need one now.  It does not explain why the District felt it could adequately rebut, without an \nexpert, Dr. Kriegler’s Second Supplemental Report, but now would be unduly prejudiced if the \n25 \n \n\nCourt does not allow it to designate an expert.  The District passed on multiple opportunities to \ndesignate a rebuttal expert.  Rule 16(b) requires a showing of good cause before the Court will \nalter the scheduling order.  The Court finds no such good cause exists, and the District has not \nconvinced it otherwise. \nIf the District sees a problem with methods and data sources used in the supplemental \nreports,  it  can  address  them  during  its  depositions  of  Mr.  Day  and  Dr.  Kriegler.    If  the \nsupplemental reports contain new, irrelevant information such as “producing expert opinions on \na  range  of  other  topics,  extending  even  to  the  idiosyncrasies  of  various  employee-review \ntechniques in the DOC Records Office,” Def.’s Mem. ISO its Mot. to Strike 12, then the solution \nwould be targeted motions in limine or motions to strike.  The solution is not to strike the whole \nreport or allow the District to appoint an unnecessary expert to rebut irrelevant information.     \nJudge Facciola, when faced with a similar set of facts, came to a reasonable solution.  In \nHubbard v. Potter, 247 F.R.D. 27, 31 (D.D.C. 2008), the defendant received a supplemental \nreport from plaintiffs’ expert.  In response, the defendant sought leave to designate rebuttal \nwitnesses, claiming that he “would be prejudiced if not permitted to respond to [plaintiffs’ \nexpert’s] conclusions in his second report.”  Id.  Judge Facciola decided: \nUnfortunately for defendant, this argument comes too late.  As noted by plaintiffs, \npursuant to the scheduling order…all expert designations were due on or before \nMarch 3, 2006, with rebuttal designations due on or before March 31, 2006.  At \nthat point in time, defendant chose not to designate an expert witness.  It also \nchose not to designate a rebuttal expert witness.  On September 8, 2006, however, \nwhen plaintiffs’ expert filed his supplemental report, defendant moved to strike, \nlimit, or exclude the report on the grounds that it exceeded the subject matter of \nthe first report.  In denying defendant's motion, the Court fashioned a practical \nsolution  to  address  defendant’s  concerns  by  allowing  defendant  to  take  a \nsupplemental deposition of plaintiffs’ expert.  Defendant has thus had ample \nopportunity  to  address  the  issues  raised  by  plaintiffs’  expert’s  supplemental \nreport.  Defendant has identified no reason why the court should allow defendant \nto change its mind at this late date, when defendant was clearly given ample \nopportunity to 1) designate an expert witness, 2) designate a rebuttal expert, and \n26 \n \n\n3)  depose  plaintiffs’  expert  on not   one  but  two  occasions,  following  the \nsubmission of both of plaintiffs’ experts’ reports. \n \nId.  The facts in this case are similar.  The District, after receiving the plaintiffs’ previous expert \nreports, did not designate their own expert.  When this Court reopened discovery so plaintiffs \ncould create reports to answer Interrogatories 1 and 2, the District did not seek leave to designate \nexperts.  And in this case, instead of granting the District’s motion to strike or leave to designate \nrebuttal experts, the Court will “fashion[] a practical solution to address defendant’s concerns by \nallowing defendant to take a…deposition” of  plaintiffs’ experts.12  Id.  Recognizing Judge \nFacciola’s wisdom and expertise resolving discovery disputes, this Court is confident following \nhis lead.  See also Dormu, 795 F. Supp. 2d at 28 n.16 (denying motion to strike supplemental \nexpert report and allowing deposition of expert to minimize any harm or prejudice); Warner, \n2002  WL  745822, *1   (allowing  additional  deposition  of  expert  in  lieu  of  precluding \nsupplemental expert report). \nAt this stage, the Court will allow the District the opportunity to depose plaintiffs’ \nexperts, but nothing more.  The Court does not feel that the changes reflected in the plaintiffs’ \nsupplemental reports provide good cause to amend the scheduling order to allow the designation \nof rebuttal experts, where the District had previously passed on several opportunities to so \ndesignate.  Nevertheless, this does not foreclose the District’s ability to designate rebuttal experts \nin the future if the plaintiffs continue to supplement and amend their expert reports.   For \nexample, if in response to the discovery compelled in the following section, plaintiffs file new \namended expert reports, the Court might then consider whether leave to designate  rebuttal \nexperts is warranted. \n                                                           \n12 This Court feels that it has already fashioned this solution, and that it had already given the \nDistrict leave to “depose both Dr. Kriegler and Mr. Day, at its option” after receipt of their supplemental \nreports.  Order, Apr. 27, 2012, ECF No. 345.  Nevertheless, the Court will “refashion” the solution and \nformally reopen discovery to allow for the depositions of Dr. Kriegler and Mr. Day. \n27 \n \n\nF.  Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Production of the Release Discrepancy Database \nFinally,  the  Court  considers  the  plaintiffs’  June  26, 2012 M otion  to  Compel  the \nProduction of the Release Discrepancy Database.  ECF No. 362.  Plaintiffs’ had originally filed a \nsimilar Motion to Compel before the end of discovery.  Non-Consent Mot. to Compel Prodc. of \nthe Release Discrepancy Database, June 11, 2012, ECF No. 356.  However, this motion failed to \ninclude the required certification that the plaintiffs met and conferred with the District prior to \nfiling. See F.R.C.P. 37(a)(1).  After so conferring, the plaintiffs filed the present motion to \nsupersede the previous defective motion.  See Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 1; Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. \nto Compel 3, July, 12, 2012, ECF No. 369. \nIn their Re-Stated Motion to Compel, the plaintiffs argue that they have not received all \nthe data and documents they requested from the District.  See Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 3–4.  A short \nhistory of how the District and plaintiffs have tracked overdetentions will be helpful.  Early in \nthe original class period—from approximately 2005 to 2007—the District had no organized way \nto track inmate overdetentions.  The data for  this period primarily came from analyses of \ninmates’ physical files (commonly referred to as “jackets”) and the DOC’s data management \nsystem, called the Jail and Community Corrections System (“JACCS”).  See Barnes, 793 F. \nSupp. 2d at 265–70.  To estimate overdetentions occurring during this early period, the plaintiffs’ \nexperts used a combination of the JACCS data and a stratified random sample of physical \njackets.  Id. at 270–71.  Since the District had no competing data the Court could credit, the \nCourt deemed plaintiffs’ facts for this early period uncontested, and granted plaintiffs summary \njudgment as to the District’s liability for overdetentions that occurred from September 1, 2005 to \nDecember 31, 2006.  Id. at 280. \nBeginning  in  January  2007,  the  District  finally  began  tracking  overdetentions  in  a \n28 \n \n\nsystematic  way.   T he  DOC  began  producing  “Discrepancy  Reports”  listing  individual \noverdetentions by month and noting the reasons for the overdetentions.  The District provided \nthese reports to the plaintiffs following a June 2011 hearing before this Court.  Id. at 270.  For \nthe purposes of these reports, the DOC defined an “overdetention” as “anyone released after \n11:59 p.m. on the day they are ordered released, or alternatively, situations where the end of \nsentence calculation was computed incorrectly.”  Souverain Decl. 2, June 7, 2011, ECF No. 301-\n2.  The DOC prepares these reports by running a query in the JACCS database to generate a \n“‘Crystal Report,’ which identifies the inmates who have been potentially over-detained.  The \ninstitutional file of each inmate on this list is then reviewed by hand and a notation is entered into \nLotus Notes as to whether the inmate was over-detained or not.”  Id. at 1–2 (emphasis in \noriginal).  This Court credited these Discrepancy Reports and found that they created a contested \nissue of material fact, precluding an award of summary judgment to either side.  Barnes, 793 F. \nSupp. 2d at 292–93.   \nAfter the Court resolved the cross-motions for summary judgment, the District’s liability \nfor overdetentions—not attributable to the 10 p.m. cut-off rule—that occurred between January \n1, 2007 and February 25, 2008 remained in dispute.  See Barnes, 278 F.R.D. at 17.  The Court \nrefers to this period, from January 2007 to February 2008, as the “disputed” or “Trial Period.”  \nSee id.  Following this narrowing of the issues, the Court opened a window of “limited fact and \nexpert discovery as to liability” permitting  “[o]nly such discovery as will assist the parties in \ndetermining how many overdetentions occurred from January 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008.”  Id. \nat 23.  The Court stated that “[n]o discovery on ‘process’ and related issues shall be permitted.”  \nId.  The Court reaffirmed and clarified the limited scope of additional discovery in its subsequent \nApril 3rd Discovery Opinion.  See Barnes, 281 F.R.D. at 55–57. \n29 \n \n\nPlaintiffs claim that the District has wrongfully withheld some of the underlying data the \nDOC used to create its Release Discrepancy Reports.  As noted above, the Reports are the result \nof District employees analyzing and compiling inmate data.  Plaintiffs refer to this underlying \ndata as the “Release Discrepancy Database,” and they claim they only received one version of \nit—what the plaintiffs call “Beta.”  Plaintiffs seek, among other documents, the entire Release \nDiscrepancy Database—what the plaintiffs call “Alpha.”  See Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 1–3.  They \nalso seek the query the DOC used to analyze inmate data and generate the Crystal Reports and \nRelease Discrepancy Database.  See Pls.’ Reply ISO its Mot. to Compel 1–3, July 25, 2012, ECF \nNo. 373.  The District counters that “plaintiffs have all the data they demanded, including all the \nunderlying JACCS data used to generate the Release Discrepancy Database,” and that plaintiffs’ \nmotion is untimely.  Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 8, 9–11, July 12, 2012, ECF No. 369. \n1.  Timeliness of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel \nThe lateness of plaintiffs’ motion concerns the Court.  The plaintiffs filed this  motion on \nJune 25, 2012—eleven days after the close of discovery, a deadline that had been extended \nmultiple times to accommodate the plaintiffs.  See ECF docket entries 328, 339, 343, 345, 355; \nMinute Order, Apr. 23, 2012 (granting plaintiffs’ Motion for Extension of Time, ECF No. 339); \nMinute Order, June 12, 2012 (granting plaintiff’s Motion for Extension of Time, ECF No. 355).  \nBased on this untimeliness, the Court might be justified in denying plaintiffs’ motion to compel.  \nSee Dag Enterprises, Inc. v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 226 F.R.D. 95, 104 (D.D.C. 2005) (ordering \nprotective order against untimely discovery filing).  The District cites a long list of cases to \nsupport its position that this Court could deny plaintiffs’ motion simply because it was filed after \nthe close of discovery.  See Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 10–11 (citing, e.g., Klugel v. \nClough, 252 F.R.D. 53, 55–56 (D.D.C. 2008) (motion to compel coming two months after close \n30 \n \n\nof discovery denied as untimely); Long v. Howard Univ., 561 F. Supp. 2d 85, 91 (D.D.C. 2008) \n(denying motion where plaintiff obtained allegedly incomplete document production “over three \nyears prior to the filing of his motion.”)).  However, if courts should deny all motions to compel \nfiled after the close of discovery, that would be the rule; it is not so.  Cf. Jinks-Umstead v. \nEngland, 227 F.R.D. 143, 153 (D.D.C. 2005) (allowing untimely discovery notices to stand). \nAt the end of its paragraph arguing that this Court should deny plaintiffs’ motion as \nuntimely, the District included one citation to contrary authority.  Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to \nCompel 10–11.  This Court recognizes the case—Lurie v. MAPMG, 262 F.R.D. 29 (D.D.C. \n2009) (Lamberth, C.J.)—as its own.  In that opinion, this Court stated: \nAlthough [defendant] contends that [plaintiff]’s motion to compel is untimely, it \ncites  no a uthority  for  its  position  that  a  motion  to  compel  filed  outside  the \ndiscovery period is untimely per se.  Indeed, to the contrary, courts routinely \nconsider motions related to discovery, even though they are filed outside the \ndiscovery  period,  especially  where  the  time  of  filing  of  such  a  motion  is \nattributable, as it is here, to the parties’ attempted settlement of the discovery \ndispute.  See, e.g., McFadden v. Ballard, Spahr, Andrews, & Ingersoll, LLP, 243 \nF.R.D. 1, 11 (D.D.C. 2007) (noting that the federal rules contain no provision \nregarding the time of filing for a motion to compel and suggesting that a per se \nrule would create perverse incentives in discovery). \n \n262 F.R.D. at 31.  This Court believes its discretion to manage its docket and oversee discovery \ncuts both ways.  While the Court is perfectly justified in denying an untimely motion if it comes \ntoo late (see Dag, 226 F.R.D. at 104), it may also exercise its discretion to permit motions to \ncompel coming after the close of discovery.  Jinks-Umstead, 227 F.R.D. at 153; Lurie, 262 \nF.R.D. at 31.  The time of the filing does not end the inquiry. \n  Certainly Courts might be less willing to grant a discovery motion filed after a scheduling \norder’s discovery deadline has passed, when the discovery deadlines have been extended several \ntimes over.  Cf., Lurie v. MAPMG, 589 F. Supp. 2d (D.D.C. 2008) (Lamberth, J.) (“Given their \nheavy case loads, district courts require the effective case management tools provided by Rule \n31 \n \n\n16.  Therefore, after the deadlines provided by a scheduling order have passed, the good cause \nstandard must be satisfied to justify leave to amend the pleadings.”) (quoting Nourison Rug \nCorp. v. Parvizian, 535 F.3d 295, 298 (4th Cir. 2008)); Johnson, 975 F.2d at 610 (“A scheduling \norder ‘is not a frivolous piece of paper, idly entered, which can be cavalierly disregarded without \nperil.’…[D]isregard of the order would undermine the court’s  ability to control its docket, \ndisrupt the agreed-upon course of litigation, and reward the indolent and the cavalier.”) (quoting \nGestener Corp v. Case Equip. Co., 108 F.R.D. 138, 141 (D. Me. 1985)). \nOn the other hand, since there is no rule “that a motion to compel filed outside the \ndiscovery period is untimely per se,” Lurie, 262 F.R.D. at 31, plaintiffs do not have to meet the \nrequirements of Federal Rule 16(b) and Local Rule 16.4 to file a motion to compel.  After all, \nthey  are not seeking an amendment to the scheduling order to  reopen discovery; they  are \ndemanding the production of documents pursuant to requests served during the discovery period.  \nPlaintiffs’ are not asking for “new” discovery—they are asking for discovery they should have \nalready received.  Therefore, while the “good cause” and “diligence” requirements of 16(b) may \nbe helpful in determining whether plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel comes too late, they do not \ncontrol.  That said, the parties do not have free reign to file discovery motions long after \ndiscovery has closed, without any justification for the delay. \nThis Court feels that it has been very generous in extending discovery, while warning the \nparties that—at some point—discovery must end.  See, e.g., Order, Apr. 27, 2012, ECF No. 345 \n(extending  discovery  but  stating,  “No  further  extensions  of  discovery  will  be  permitted.”).  \nHowever, unless there would be some undue prejudice to the parties, it is for the Court to decide \nwhen this generosity runs out.  In Beale v. District of Columbia, 545 F. Supp. 2d 8, 15 –16 \n(D.D.C. 2008), the plaintiffs contended that the Judge Kay “bound himself to the deadlines for \n32 \n \n\nthe defendant’s expert reports and the close of discovery…because he wrote [in an earlier \nOrder]: ‘There will be no further extensions of discovery.’”  Judge Urbina eloquently responded: \nThe plaintiffs forget a fundamental rule of litigation: the court’s discretionary \npronouncements are for it—not the parties—to enforce.  A judge does not bind his \nown broad discretion when he runs a tight ship.  And if, in furtherance of case \nmanagement, a judge occasionally betrays the fact that his bark is scarier than his \nbite, that is not a grievance on which a losing party is entitled to rest a reversal. \n \n545 F. Supp. 2d at 16 (citations omitted).  This Court truly wishes, in the spirit of its April 27, \n2012 Order, ECF No. 345, that discovery for the liability phase would be finished by now.  \nHowever, the Court finds reason to partially grant plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel, despite the fact \nthat it was filed after the close of fact discovery. \n  The  plaintiffs  filed  their  motion  less  than  two  weeks  after  the  close  of  additional \ndiscovery.  The cases cited by the District, Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 10, deal with \nsignificantly longer delays.  See Klugel, 252 F.R.D. at 55–56 (motion to compel filed two months \nafter close of discovery); Long, 561 F. Supp. 2d at 91 (motion filed over three years after \nplaintiff received allegedly incomplete document production);  Suntrust Bank  v. Blue  Water \nFiber, LP, 210 F.R.D. 196, 201–202 (E.D. Mich. 2002) (motion filed 18 months after discovery \nclosed); Tim W. Koerner & Assocs., Inc., 492 F. Supp. 294, 298 (S.D. Tex. 1980) (motion filed \nnine months after plaintiff received allegedly defective production).  Since “courts routinely \nconsider motions related to discovery[] even though they are filed outside the discovery period,” \nLurie, 262 F.R.D. at 31, this Court finds that an eleven day delay does not necessarily disqualify \nplaintiffs’ motion. \n2.  Substantive Merits of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel \nThe  timeliness  of  plaintiffs’  motion  will  play  a  factor,  but  not  control,  the  Court’s \ndisposition of plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel.  Therefore, the Court will consider the substantive \n33 \n \n\nmerits of plaintiffs’ requests in greater detail. \nPlaintiffs claim the information they seek relates to three previous document requests.  \nPlaintiffs’ Eighth Document Requests sought “[a] Release Processing System Data Production to \ninclude data from all fields and all tables for inmates released on or after September 1, 2005” and \n“all writings or documents related to any Lotus Notes system used in the commitment detention \nor release of inmates from any DOC facility including data in-putted into the system since 2005 \nand all writings or documents related to show how the system was created or is maintained or \noperated.”  See Def.’s Resp. to Pls.’ Eighth Doc. Req. 4, 8, M ar. 29, 2010, ECF No. 366-4 \n(original formatting omitted).  In the Document Requests Served in the Deposition Notice of \nShirley Simmons, plaintiffs requested “[a]ny other reports or writings generated by or for the \nDistrict of Columbia regarding late releases and erroneous releases.”  See Def.’s Resp. to Pls.’ \nDoc. Req. Served in Dep. Notice of Shirley Simmons 8, March 23, 2010, ECF No. 366-6.  The \nDistrict argues that it produced everything responsive to these requests, subject to its objections \nlimiting production to the class period; and, in any event, plaintiffs’ requests come years after \nthey should have realized the production was incomplete.  See Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to \nCompel 4–11. \nAfter ruling on summary judgment, the Court ordered the parties to focus their remaining \ndiscovery efforts on the “disputed” or “Trial Period.”  Barnes, 278 F.R.D. at 17.  Despite this, \nplaintiffs seek discovery beyond the Trial Period, including “the entire Release Discrepancy \nDatabase for the class period to date.”  Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 1.  The document requests plaintiffs \nclaim cover this all predate this Court’s summary judgment ruling.  Compare Id. at 10–13 \n(listing three document requests), with Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 292–93 (June 24, 2011).  \n34 \n \n\nPlaintiffs’ Eighth Document Requests, quoted supra, came before March 29, 2010.13  See Def.’s \nResp. to Pls.’ Eighth Doc. Req. 10.  Plaintiffs’ Document Request Served in Deposition Notice \nof Shirley Simmons, quoted supra, came before March 23, 2010.  See Def.’s Resp. to Pls.’ Doc. \nReq. Served in Dep. Notice of Shirley Simmons 10.  When the Court restricted all additional \ndiscovery to the “Trial Period,” it stated that “[d]iscovery beyond this narrow issue would \nneedlessly prolong this litigation, since plaintiffs had ample opportunity to probe such issues \nprior to the close of liability-phase discovery.”  278 F.R.D. at 18–19.  The Court finds no reason \nto reopen discovery beyond the disputed period.  To the extent the Court grants any part of \nplaintiffs’ Motion to Compel, such production shall be limited to documents relating to alleged \noverdetentions occurring from January 1, 2007 t o February 25, 2008, and any documents or \nwritings that would aid plaintiffs in interpreting data from that period (even if such writings were \ncreated outside of the Trial Period). \ni.  Plaintiffs’ Request for the Entire Release Discrepancy Database for the \nClass Period and All Documents Needed to Interpret the Data \n \nFirst, the plaintiffs ask the Court to compel the District to produce: \nthe entire Release Discrepancy Database for the class period to date in native \nformat or in an excel spreadsheet, as well as all documents needed to interpret the \ndata in the database, such as the names of the fields, both the programmer names \nand the data entry field names, and to produce all writings on how the database \nwas created and how it has been used by the District. \n \nPls.’ Mot. to Compel 1–2.  As noted above, the Court will not permit any production beyond the \nTrial  Period.    Therefore,  plaintiffs  are  not  entitled  to  production  of  “the  entire  Release \nDiscrepancy  Database”  regardless  of  whether  this  information  is  responsive  to  an  earlier \ndocument request.  The time for that discovery has long since passed, and the Court and parties \n                                                           \n13 The plaintiffs attached, as the exhibits to their Motion to Compel, the District’s responses to \ntheir document requests instead of the original requests.  See Pls.’ Sealed Exs., July 2, 2012, ECF Nos. \n366-1–10.  The District’s responses are dated, and logic dictates that the plaintiffs could not serve \nrequests before the date the District responded. \n35 \n \n\nhave shifted their focus to the Trial Period.  In the next section, the Court considers whether the \nplaintiffs  are  entitled  to  the  complete  Release  Discrepancy  Database  as  it  relates  to  the \noverdetentions that occurred during the Trial Period.14 \n  The party filing a motion to compel has the burden of showing that the production they \nreceived is incomplete or inadequate.  Equal Rights Ctr., 246 F.R.D. at 32.  There is a showing \nthat the District withheld the query DOC used to analyze inmate data and generate the Crystal \nReports and Release Discrepancy Database.15  See Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 5–8; Pls.’ Reply ISO its \nMot. to Compel 1–4.  The “query” refers to the search algorithm the DOC ran against inmate \ndata to identify potential overdetentions.  In essence, it is a set of software commands created by \nthe  District  to  help  create  the  Discrepancy  Reports.   A s  such,  it  is  “electronically  stored \ninformation” that counts as a “writing” under Federal Rule 34(a)(1)(A).  The Court also agrees \nwith  plaintiffs  that  the  query  is  a  “writing  generated  by  or  for  the  government  of  the \nDistrict…regarding  late  releases  or  erroneous  releases”  relating  to  “documents  needed  to \ninterpret the data in the database.”  See Pls.’ Reply ISO its Mot. to Compel 3.  T he query is \nclearly  relevant  to  the  case.    In  order  for  the  plaintiffs  to  understand  fully  the  District’s \nDiscrepancy Reports, they need to have all the underlying data and information on how the DOC \nprepared the Reports.  The query the DOC used is a critical piece of this—it selected which \n                                                           \n14 Although the Court separates the plaintiffs’ motion into two “requests,” there is some overlap \nbetween the two. \n \n15 The District moved for leave to file a surreply, claiming that “plaintiffs in their Reply raise for \nthe first time the issue of whether the District produced the disputed query[.]”  Def.’s Mot. for Leave to \nFile Surreply, Aug. 2, 2012, ECF No. 376.  This Court, noting that “surreplies are generally disfavored,” \ndenied the District’s motion.  Memorandum and Order, Sept. 5, 2012, ECF No. 386 (quoting Glass v. \nLaHood, 786 F. Supp. 2d 189, 231 (D.D.C. 2011)).  The Court concedes that plaintiffs went into far \ngreater detail about the query in thier Reply.  See Pls.’ Reply ISO its Mot. to Compel 1–4.  However, this \nwas in direct response to the District’s lengthy discussion of the query in its Opposition.  See Def.’s \nOpp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 5–8.  Therefore, if anyone raised it for the first time, it was the District.  \nAnd most importantly, this Court thoroughly reviewed the District’s proposed surreply before denying \nleave.  The Court did not see anything that would convince it to rule on plaintiffs’ motion differently. \n36 \n \n\nrecords would be subject to further review.  See Souverain Decl. 1–2 (“In order to identify an \nover-detention, the DOC runs a “Crystal Report,” which identified the inmates who have been \npotentially over-detained.”); Decl. of Steve Fezuk ¶ 5, July 12, 2012, ECF No. 370-3 (“Every \nmonth, a query is run in JACCS to identify potential late releases, and the data obtained from the \nquery is exported (in spreadsheet form) into the Release Discrepancy Database.”); Decl. of \nReena Chakraborty passim, June 29, 2012, ECF No. 370-4 (discussing use of query in preparing \nDiscrepancy Reports).  The plaintiffs have the right to check the District’s work and determine \nwhether the Discrepancy Reports accurately reflect the total number of overdetentions. \n  Having established that the query is a writing, falls under one of the plaintiffs’ previous \ndocument requests, and is relevant, the Court must determine if there is any reason not to compel \nits production.  If the plaintiffs already received the query the District used, then there is nothing \nto compel.  Cf. Hubbard, 247 F.R.D. at 29 (“[P]laintiffs fail to account for the possibility that \nthey may in fact have already received all responsive documents.”).  The District seems to \nconcede, in its Opposition and exhibits thereto, that the plaintiffs have not received the query the \nDOC used to prepare its Discrepancy Reports.  The District repeatedly argues that “the query \nidentified [by plaintiffs] is not the one used to generate the Release Discrepancy Database.”  See, \ne.g., Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 6.  What is missing—tellingly—is any claim by the \nDistrict that it has already produced the query the DOC did use.  Even in their  proposed \nSurreply—which the District claimed was necessary to counter the plaintiffs’ “new” allegation in \nReply that the District did not produce the query (Def.’s Mot. for Leave to File Surreply 2)—the \nbest the District could argue was that since the plaintiffs had “re-created” the disputed query \n“based on the information provided by the District” they already have it and their motion is \nmoot.  Def.’s Proposed Surreply 2, Aug. 2, 2012, ECF No. 376-2.  This does not explain why the \n37 \n \n\nDistrict never produced the query in the first place, and therefore the plaintiffs meet their burden \nof showing that the District’s production was incomplete.16 \nAfter  incompleteness  has  been  established,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  party  opposing \nproduction to show that the movant’s requests are burdensome, overly broad, vague, outside the \nscope of discovery, or otherwise fall within the limitations on discovery in Rule 26(b)(2)(C).  \nChubb Integrated Sys. Ltd. v. Nat’l Bank of Washington, 103 F.R.D. 52, 59–60 (D.D.C. 1984).  \nThe plaintiffs should not have to reverse engineer the District’s query.17  It would be much \nsimpler for the District just to produce it.  Therefore, the query’s production would not be \n“unreasonably cumulative or duplicative” and it could not be “obtained from some other source” \nthan  the  District  “that  is  more  convenient,  less  burdensome,  or  less  expensive.”   F .R.C.P. \n26(b)(2)(C)(i).  Moreover, the District makes no claim that “the burden or expense of the \nproposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.”  F.R.C.P. 26(b)(2)(C)(iii).  The District does \nnot contend that the query would be particularly expensive to find or produce.  Presumably, the \nquery is simply a set of instructions that the Lotus Notes database program runs against the \ninmate data.  The query itself must dwarf in “size” when compared to the data to which it is \nbeing  applied.    Furthermore,  as  a  query  repeatedly  used  by  the  DOC  to  help  generate  its \nDiscrepancy Reports, it should be easily identifiable.  Based on the District’s multiple assertions \nthat the plaintiffs are confused as to which query the DOC ran (see, e.g., Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ \nMot. to Compel 6–8), surely the District knows which query the DOC did run. \n                                                           \n16 It is not material to the outcome of this motion that, in a sense, the District’s Opposition made \nthe clearest case that the plaintiffs do not have the query.  After reading the briefings, the Court is \nconvinced that the District failed to identify or produce something it should have. \n \n17 The District also does not get to say, in one place, that the plaintiffs already have the correct \nquery because they re-created it, Def.’s Proposed Surreply 2, but claim elsewhere that the plaintiffs’ query \nwas not the one used by the District.  See Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 7 (“Plaintiffs simply \nassumed that the overbroad query developed by Lee Gazlay to identify potential overdetentions is the \nsame one used by the DOC to generate the Release Discrepancy Database.  Not so.”). \n38 \n \n\nThe District rests part of its argument on Federal Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(ii), which provides \nthat “the court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by these \nrules…if it determines that…the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the \ninformation by discovery in the action[.]”  See also Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 11 \n(“[P]laintiffs’ motion should be denied pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C)(ii)[.]”).  This is \nwhere the timeliness of plaintiffs’ motion—discussed in detail in Part III.F.1. supra—comes in.  \nWhen  a  party’s  motion  comes  late,  some  courts  have  denied  motions  to  compel  on \n26(b)(2)(C)(ii) grounds because the party “had ample opportunity to obtain the information \nduring the fact discovery period, and failed to raise the issue with the Court at the appropriate \ntime.”  Gucci America, Inc. v. Guess?, Inc., 790 F. Supp. 2d 136, 140–42 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). \nThe District’s own Opposition helps explain why the plaintiffs might not have objected to \nthis incomplete production earlier—the plaintiffs could have been under the false impression, for \nsome time, that they already had the query the District used.  As the District explains: \nPlaintiffs…cite the query developed by Lee Gazlay (a former consultant for DOC) \nto identify potential late releases as the source of the “Crystal Reports” which are \nexported on a monthly basis from JACCS into the Release Discrepancy Database.  \nBut the query identified is not the one used to generate the Release Discrepancy \nDatabase….[T]he query identified by Lee Gazlay and discussed in his deposition \nhas never been identified (by DOC) as the one used by DOC to generate the \nRelease Discrepancy Database. \n \nDef.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 6.  What the District does not say is that it has produced \nthe query that DOC did use, and if the plaintiffs searched the production they could have \ncorrected their mistake.  Generally, adversaries do not have a duty to actively help the other \nside—but the District did have a duty to produce the query.  The District’s Opposition also does \nnot provide a real explanation of why the query was not produced in the first place.  The District \ncannot withhold discoverable information, allow plaintiffs falsely to think they already have the \n39 \n \n\ninformation, and then claim the request comes too late once plaintiffs realize they do not have \nthe correct information.  Permitting such an approach could incentivize discovery abuses. \n  The “query” is a writing, the production of which is reasonably calculated to lead to the \nproduction of relevant evidence.  See F.R.C.P. 34(a)(1)(A); F.R.C.P. 26(b)(1).  It should have \nbeen produced pursuant to plaintiffs previous request for “all writings or documents related to \nshow how the system was created,” See Def.’s Resp. to Pls.’ Eighth Doc. Req. 8.  Its production \nhas been again requested by the plaintiffs’ motion to compel “all documents needed to interpret \nthe data in the database” and “all writings on how the database was created and how it has been \nused by the District.”  Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 1–2.  With the burden of showing that the District’s \nproduction was incomplete met (see Guantanamera Cigar Co. v. Corporation Habanos, S.A., \n263 F.R.D. 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2009) (Lamberth, C.J.)), the District has not met its burden to show that \nthe  plaintiffs’  request  is  overbroad,  vague,  or  falls  under  one  of  the  limitations  of  Rule \n26(b)(2)(C).  See Chubb, 103 F.R.D. at 59–60.  While the plaintiffs’ request for the query comes \nlate, that does not overcome the plaintiffs’ right to the information.   Therefore, the Court will \ngrant, in part, plaintiffs motion to compel as to their first request.  The Court will order the \nimmediate production of any database query or search algorithm used by the District during the \nTrial Period to help prepare its Discrepancy Reports.  \nHowever,  the  plaintiffs’  request  for  the  entire  Release  Discrepancy  Database  is \noverbroad, especially considering the Court’s narrowing of the remaining discovery to the “Trial \nPeriod.”  Furthermore, except as to the “query,” the plaintiffs have not shown that the District’s \nproduction was otherwise incomplete.  In the following section, the Court will discuss in greater \ndetail the plaintiffs’ claim that there are records and data missing from the produced version of \nthe Release Discrepancy Database. \n40 \n \n\n \nii.  Plaintiffs’ Request for the All the Data the District Used to Complete its \nDiscrepancy Reports \n \nSecond, the plaintiffs ask the Court to compel the District to produce: \nthe  entire  database  or  electronic  compilation  of  records  from  which  the \ndiscrepancy reports filed by the District under Notice of Filing [Document # 301] \nand  referenced  by  Ms.  Souverain  in  her  Declaration  [Document  # 301 -2] \n[“Delta”] were taken from, if that database is different from the complete Release \nDiscrepancy Database [“Alpha”].18 \n \nPls.’ Mot. to Compel 2.  As with the plaintiffs’ first request, any production would need to be \nlimited to the Trial Period, and the Court will not order the production of “the entire database” \nextending beyond the period of overdetentions in dispute. \n  Plaintiffs’ basic argument is that while “complying with the Court’s order to calculate \ntotal  over-detentions  for  the  Trial  Period  and  total  ‘disputed  over-detentions’  for  the  Trial \nPeriod,” plaintiffs’ expert examined “the information available,” and discovered that “the version \nof Release Discrepancy Database the District produced” was missing information.  Pls.’ Mot. to \nCompel 3–4.  As such, the plaintiffs request “production of the missing records, the missing \ncomments, and the missing entries from the Discrepancy Type field.”  Id. at 4. \n  The District argues that there is “no data is missing here.”  Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to \nCompel 4 (formatting omitted).  First, the District spends over three pages of its Opposition \narguing that the plaintiffs used the wrong “query” to examine the District’s raw data and “find” \nmissing records.  Id. at 4–8.  Since the plaintiffs used the wrong “query,” their claims about \nmissing information are erroneous.  See id.  Furthermore, as to the plaintiffs’ “complain[t] that \nempty comments in the District’s Release Discrepancy Database is ‘missing’ information that \nshould be compelled,” the District responds:  “However, when District employees are entering \n                                                           \n18 The Court also considers, in this section, the plaintiffs’ request for “Alpha”—the entire Release \nDiscrepancy Database which, plaintiffs claim, contains records missing from what has been produced. \n41 \n \n\ndata in the Release Discrepancy Database, comments are optional.”  Id. at 7 (emphasis in \noriginal).  Overall, the District’s argument is:  “The records plaintiffs claim are ‘missing’ were \nnever part of the Release Discrepancy Database in the first place; plaintiffs have all the data they \ndemanded, including all the underlying JACCS data used to generate the Release Discrepancy \nDatabase....The information plaintiffs claim is ‘missing’ or ‘withheld’ is neither.  The District \nproduced the complete  Release  Discrepancy  Database, and  all the data from  which it was \ndeveloped.”  Id. at 8–9. \n  This request comes down to whether the plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that \nthe District’s production is incomplete.  If there is any “missing” information, the plaintiffs are \nentitled to it.  The complete database and all the information the District used to prepare its \nDiscrepancy Reports are clearly relevant under Rule 26(b)(1) and responsive to plaintiffs’ prior \ndocument requests.19  See Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 10–13 (listing three document requests quoted in \nthis Opinion supra).  If there is missing data, the District has not made any showing that \nproducing it would be unduly expensive or burdensome under Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii).  It has made \nno showing that the information could come from a more convenient or less expensive source \nunder Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(i).  To the extent there are additional unproduced records, producing \nthem would not be “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative.”  F.R.C.P. 26(b)(2)(C)(i).  The \nDistrict may not produce some, but not all, of the data and claim that plaintiffs have everything \nthey need.  The plaintiffs are entitled to all the tools needed to critically analyze the District’s \nDiscrepancy Reports and come to their own estimates of overdetentions.  See Novelty, Inc. v. \nMountain View Marketing, Inc., 265 F.R.D. 370, 378 (S.D. Ind. 2009) (“Producing only those \ndocuments that are deemed helpful to the producing party's litigation position—parsing out the \n                                                           \n19 Again, subject to the limitation that any information produced must be relevant to alleged \noverdetentions occurring during the Trial Period. \n42 \n \n\nbad from the good—is, of course, impermissible.”); see also United States v. Procter & Gamble \nCo., 356 U.S. 677, 682 (1958) (explaining that liberal discovery provisions of Federal Rules are \ndesigned to make “trial less a game of blind man’s bluff and more a fair context with the basic \nissues and facts disclosed to the fullest practical extent.”).  The plaintiffs also explain why their \nmotion  to  compel  comes  relatively  late,  and  why  they  have  not  previously  “had  ample \nopportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action.”  F.R.C.P. 26(b)(2)(C)(ii).  The \nplaintiffs did not notice that records might be missing until they calculated, per Court order, the \nnumber of alleged overdetentions for the Trial Period.  See Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 2–3.  After \nmaking  this  “discovery,”  the  plaintiffs  promptly  told  the  District  and  this  Court  that  they \nbelieved records were missing. \n  To find that a production is incomplete, the Court requires more than a mere “theoretical \npossibility that more documents exist…to justify additional discovery.”  Hubbard, 247 F.R.D. at \n29.  Instead, the Court must be able to make a “reasonable deduction” from the documents that \nexist that “other documents may exist or did exist and have been destroyed.”  Id.  See also \nHarris, 271 F.R.D. at 370 (“If plaintiffs are speculating that documents responsive to these \nrequests do exist, there must be a reasonable deduction that that is true, and not a mere hunch.”).  \nThe Court believes the District when it says the plaintiffs were using the incorrect query to \ndetermine that there were records missing.  Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Compel 4–8.  As such, \nthe plaintiffs have not—for now—met their burden of proving that there are any missing records \nto be produced.  However, the Court will deny the plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel on this issue \nwithout prejudice.  The plaintiffs were unable to correctly scrutinize the District’s data because \nthe query—key to understanding how the District analyzed its data—has not been produced.  As \nexplained supra, the Court will compel the immediate production of the query used during the \n43 \n \n\nTrial  Period  to  analyze  inmate  data  and  generate  the  Release  Discrepancy  Database  and \nDiscrepancy Reports.  If, after using the correct query to analyze the information available, the \nplaintiffs can show that information is missing, then the plaintiffs may then file a motion to \ncompel.  The Court urges the plaintiffs to work diligently and quickly, after receiving the correct \nquery, to determine if any files are missing, so discovery for the liability phase may finally come \nto an end. \n \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nBoth of the District’s motions, [351] and [365], would have been unnecessary had the \nparties carefully reviewed this Court’s orders and engaged in discovery in good faith.  Both the \nDistrict and the plaintiffs are to blame.  The District asked for answers to interrogatories it \nshould have known were forthcoming.  When the District received those answers, it moved to \nstrike them—based, in part, on undue surprise.  The District failed on several opportunities to \ndesignate a rebuttal expert, but now demands leave almost two years after receiving the initial \nreport from plaintiffs’ experts.  The plaintiffs, while asking the Court to compel a narrative \nresponse to one of their interrogatories, felt they did not need to do the same when answering a \nnearly identical interrogatory from the District. \nThis  case  presents  serious  issues.   T his  Court  has  already  found  that  the  District \nwrongfully overdetained hundreds of inmates.  Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 286.  Hundreds more \nalleged overdetentions are now in dispute.  If true, this represents a considerable civil rights \nviolation.  The Court understands that the attorneys owe a duty to be zealous advocates for their \nclients, but this does not excuse gaming discovery simply to gain a tactical advantage.  It does \nnot excuse sloppy, late, or repetitive filings.  It does not excuse failing to examine this Court’s \nprior orders, and not asking for clarification if key points are ambiguous.  Each party has reason \n44 \n \n\nto be annoyed and frustrated at the other, and this comes out in their filings.  But the Court urges \nthe parties to remember the importance of this case.  The plaintiffs’ counsel does not simply \nrepresent the named parties, but hundreds who may have had their civil rights violated.  The \ndefendant’s counsel represents the District of Columbia, and by extension its over 600,000 \ncitizens.20  Both parties owe a duty to litigate this case fairly, honestly, and carefully.  The Court \nknows that each party is capable of such, and asks them to focus on the real issues, instead of \nhow many misspellings are in the other party’s filing.21 \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court denies in part and grants in part the District’s \nMotion to Compel [ECF No. 351].  The District has already received a satisfactory response to \nInterrogatories 1 and 2 and thus the Court denies the motion as to those interrogatories.  The \nplaintiffs refused to answer Interrogatory 13 because the District had not answered a virtually \nidentical question the way plaintiffs wanted.  The Court grants the District’s motion as to \nInterrogatory 13 and orders the plaintiffs to answer the question in the same manner the Court \nhad earlier directed the District.  See Barnes, 2012 WL 3105218, *4 (granting plaintiffs’ motion \nto compel against District on virtually identical interrogatory). \nThe Court denies the District’s Motion to Strike [ECF No. 365].  The Court finds no \nreason to strike supplemental expert reports that the Court itself ordered.  Motions to Strike are \nstrongly disfavored and require the Court to consider alternatives.  The Court also denies the \nDistrict’s motion, in the alternative, for an extension of time and leave to designate rebuttal \nexperts [ECF No. 365].  The Court has not found that good cause exists to grant leave to \n                                                           \n20 The Census Bureau estimates the population of the District of Columbia, as of July 2011, as \n617,996.  U.S. Census Bureau, Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, \nRegions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July, 1 2011, 2011 POPULATION ESTIMATES (Dec. \n2011), available at http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2011/tables/NST-EST2011-01.csv. \n \n21 The Court also asks the parties not to include such careless typos in the first place. \n45 \n \n\ndesignate experts after the close of discovery.  The District’s request to reopen discovery for 72 \ndays to allow for the depositions of Dr. Kriegler and Mr. Day is excessive.  Instead, the Court \nreopens discovery for 28 days from this date for the sole purpose of allowing the District to \ndepose Dr. Kriegler and Mr. Day. \nThe plaintiffs’ Non-Consent and Re-Stated Motion to Compel the Production of the \nRelease Discrepancy Database [ECF No. 362] presents more complicated issues.  The Court’s \nApril 3rd Discovery Opinion required the plaintiffs to revise their expert reports to focus on \noverdetentions occurring during the “disputed” or “Trial Period.”  In doing so, the plaintiffs \nclaim  they  discovered  that  the  District’s  production  was  incomplete.   T he  plaintiffs  seek \ncomplete discovery, including the entire Release Discrepancy Database—what the plaintiffs dub \n“Alpha.”  In responding to the plaintiffs’ motion, the District argued that the plaintiffs used \nfaulty methods to determine that there are “missing” records.  Therefore, as long as the plaintiffs’ \nargument rests on their application of the wrong “query,” they cannot meet their burden of \nshowing that “Alpha” exists and has not been produced.  In so replying, however, the District \nbetrayed the fact that the District never revealed or produced which “query” the DOC did use to \nidentify  potential  overdetentions.    By  discussing  the  unproduced  and  undisclosed  query  in \ngreater detail, the District’s Opposition helped the plaintiffs demonstrate that the District’s \nproduction was incomplete and that the District wrongfully withheld production of the query. \nTherefore, the Court grants in part and denies in part plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel [362].  \nThe Court compels the District to immediately produce and identify any Lotus Notes query or \nother search algorithm used by the defendant or defendant’s agent(s) during the Trial Period to \nanalyze JACCS or other inmate data to identify potential overdetentions, or any query otherwise \nused in connection with generating the Discrepancy Reports and Release Discrepancy Database \n46 \n \n\nduring  the  Trial  Period.   T he  Court  will  not  compel  the  production  of  the  entire  Release \nDiscrepancy Database.  The Court furthermore denies, without prejudice, plaintiffs’ motion to \ncompel the production of data underlying the District’s Discrepancy reports to the extent such \ndata is different from the version of the Release Discrepancy Database the District has already \nproduced.  The plaintiffs cannot, at this time, meet their burden of showing that any records or \ndata is missing; however, after the plaintiffs have had a chance to analyze the District’s data \nusing the correct query, they might be able to make such a showing. \nA separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue this date. \nOriginally Signed, Royce C. Lamberth, Chief Judge, September 19, 2012. \n \nAmended Pursuant to Rule 60(a).  Mem. Op. & Order, Sept. 28, 2012, ECF No. 396. \nAmended Opinion Signed, Royce C.

BARNES, et al., )\n)\nPlaintiffs, )\n)\nv. ) Civil Action No. 06-315 (RCL)\n)\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, )\n)\nDefendant. )\n____________________________________)\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nThis is a case in which history insists on repeating itself.  The subject matter is virtually\nidentical to a prior case before this Court, the arguments are the same, even the same procedural\ndefaults have been made.  If the past is prologue, then the result here must be predictable.  Before\nthe Court is the District of Columbia’s Motion [14] to Dismiss, or in the alternative, its Motion\n[15] for Summary Judgment, and its Motion [26] for an extension of time to respond to\nplaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  As explained more fully below, all of these motions are\nDENIED, and the plaintiffs’ Motion [7] for Class Certification is GRANTED, with the result that\nthe Court certifies this action as a hybrid class action.  Finally, plaintiffs’ Motions [24 & 30] for\nDiscovery are DENIED as moot.\nI.  Background \nThis case is directly linked to one that previously came before this Court, Bynum v.\nDistrict of Columbia, Civil Action No. 02-956 (RCL).  In that case the Court certified a class of\nsome 4,000 former prisoners of the District of Columbia’s Department of Corrections (“D.O.C.”)\n1\n\nwho alleged they had been detained by D.O.C. beyond the point at which their release had been\nordered, for periods ranging from an extra day to many days or even months on end.  Also\ncertified was a class of former prisoners who alleged that they were subjected to strip searches\nafter their release had been ordered.  The Court certified an “Overdetention Class” and a “Strip\nSearch Class” representing both types of claimants, which overlapped a great deal, and denied\nmotions by the District to dismiss and for summary judgment.  The parties reached a settlement\nof that case in August of 2005, which the Court approved in January, 2006.  \nThe problem in Bynum, as alleged by plaintiffs in that case and this one, was that “court\nreleases,” inmates who were entitled to release after a court appearance, were typically taken\nfrom court to the Central Detention Facility (“D.C. Jail”) or the Correctional Treatment Facility\n(“CTF”) to await the administrative processing of their release, often called “out-processing.”1 \nThis process, which apparently involves ministerial tasks such as acquiring the release order,\nchecking a prisoner’s record to make sure there was no other warrant or order that would justify\ncontinued detention, retrieving a prisoner’s personal property, and the like.  The class members\nin Bynum were all held at least past midnight on the day their release was ordered, and frequently\none day of overdetention turned into two, or a week, or even more.  Because these prisoners were\nreturned to the general population while they awaited outprocessing, they were subjected to strip\nsearches, sometimes multiple times, as it appears that the D.O.C. policy is to strip search\neveryone who enters the general population from outside.  See Second Amended Complaint\n(“2AC”) at ¶¶ 4, 13 [12]; Defendant’s Mem. in Support of Motion to Dismiss [14] at 4.  \n1The allegations in Bynum, and this case, also occasionally involved D.O.C.-run halfway\nhouses throughout the District. \n2\n\nIn August of 2005, as Bynum neared settlement, D.O.C. adopted a policy of diverting in-\ncustody defendants who had been ordered released or who were otherwise entitled to release to a\nholding facility on the grounds of D.C. General Hospital.  2AC ¶ 40.  D.O.C. administered\noutprocessing there instead of at D.C. Jail or the CTF, which meant that inmates were not\nsubjected to strip searches absent some individualized suspicion.  Id.  But sometime around\nDecember 2005, the cracks in this system began to widen, with more and more inmates who were\nentitled to release slipping through and being returned to D.C. Jail or the CTF.  Once there, they\nencountered the same dance with D.O.C. that arose in Bynum: inmates entitled to release were\nnot released until the next day, or sometimes days or even weeks later, and inmates who were\nentitled to release were forced to undergo strip searches.  The named plaintiffs – who allege they\nwere detained for anywhere from four to 29 days after their release dates – identify almost forty\nother individuals who were overdetained, strip searched, or both, and allege there are potentially\nhundreds of other inmates who were subjected to the same treatment.2\nAccording to plaintiffs, the recurrence of the overdetention and strip search issues is due\nto many factors, including computer problems and “the deliberate indifference of the acting\nwarden Patricia Britton and the acting director Elwood York and the resignation of competent\nmanagers from the Records Office and the failure to replace them.”  2AC ¶ 42.  They also allege\nthat D.O.C. staff reported the problems up the chain of command, but that superiors “are\ndisregarding the problem and acquiescing in the current overdetention and strip search problem.” \n2This is not the only case alleging that D.O.C.’s problems resurfaced in the fall of 2005. \nIn Simmons v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 07-493 (JR), an individual plaintiff has\nsued the District, alleging, among other things, that he was detained for several weeks after a\njudge ordered his release, and was subjected to a body cavity search during that time.\n3\n\n2AC ¶¶ 43, 44.\nPlaintiffs brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the overdetention\nviolates the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments, while the strip searches violate the Fourth\nand Fifth Amendments.  2AC ¶¶ 3, 4.  They allege that District administrators and policymakers\nwere deliberately indifferent to the rights of inmates while administering the maintenance of\ninmate records and in imposing the strip search policy.  They also allege that it is the practice and\ncustom of the District to overdetain inmates.  Id. ¶¶ 79-82.  Plaintiffs seek damages and\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.\nII.  Motion to Dismiss \nA.  Alternative Motion for Summary Judgment \nThe District has moved [14] to dismiss for failure to state a claim, or, in the alternative,\nfor summary judgment. [15]  The decision of whether to convert a motion to dismiss to one for\nsummary judgment rests in the discretion of the court.  The only extraneous matter the District\nsubmitted was an affidavit from a D.O.C. employee which, as plaintiffs point out, suffers from\nseveral evidentiary deficiencies.  More importantly, this case is at far too early of a state for\nsummary judgment to be appropriate.  There has been no discovery and the record is thin.\nIn Bynum summary judgment was rejected where, as here, “it would be premature to\nconsider a motion for summary judgment when the discovery process, which has apparently not\neven commenced, might yield additional facts that would guide the Court’s decision as to the\nmerits of plaintiffs’ strip search claims.”  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 215 F.R.D. 1, 4\n(D.D.C. 2003).  As then, it is still the general rule that “decision by summary judgment is\ndisfavored when additional development of facts might illuminate the issues of law requiring\n4\n\ndecision.”  Nixon v. Freeman,670 F.2d 346, 362 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  Nearly every issue in this case\nwould benefit from illumination via the discovery process: the causes for and extent of delayed\nrelease, the nature of the strip search policy, where and with whom these problems originated,\nand a host of other factors the Court must consider are all dependent on facts that have not been\ndeveloped.  For this reason the Court will not treat the District’s motion as one for summary\njudgment, but rather as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and the Motion [15] for\nSummary Judgment is DENIED.\nB.  Standard on 12(b)(6) Motion\nWhen a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is at hand, plaintiffs’ factual allegations are presumed true\nand construed liberally in their favor.  See Swierkiewicz v. Sonoma N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 511-14\n(2002), Krieger v. Fadely, 211 F.3d 134, 136 (D.C. Cir. 2000), Alexander v. FBI, 971 F.Supp.\n603, 608 (D.D.C. 1997).  “The complaint should be dismissed only if it appears beyond doubt\nthat, under any reasonable pleading, plaintiffs will be unable to prove any set of facts that would\njustify relief.”  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 257 F.Supp. 2d 1, 1 (D.D.C. 2002).  \nPlaintiffs bring their claims under § 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which creates\nliability for “[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or\nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected,\nany citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation\nof any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.”  42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nThe Supreme Court laid out the standard for municipal liability under § 1983 in Monell v.\nDepartment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978): “Local governing bodies . . . can be sued\ndirectly under § 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that\n5\n\nis alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance,\nregulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body’s officers,” which can\ninclude “constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental ‘custom’ even though such\na custom has not received formal approval through the body’s official decisionmaking channels.” \nId. at 690; see also Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 167-68 (1970) (discussing\nliability predicated on municipal “custom” or practice).\nThus “the plaintiff must prove that the District of Columbia has a ‘custom or practice that\nis the moving force behind the alleged . . . violations.’”  Zearley v. Ackerman, 116 F.Supp. 2d\n109, 114 (D.D.C. 2000) (quoting Walker v. District of Columbia, 969 F.Supp. 794, 797 (D.D.C.\n1997)).  “Although Monell allows claims based upon a well-settled municipal custom, plaintiff\nmust ‘show fault on the part of the city based on a course its policymakers consciously chose to\npursue.’” Triplett v. District of Columbia, 108 F.3d 1450, 1453 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (internal citation\nomitted) (quoting Carter v. District of Columbia, 795 F.2d 116, 122 (D.C. Cir. 1986). As set\nforth by the Court of Appeals for this Circuit:\nThe court must determine whether plaintiff has alleged an ‘affirmative link,’ such that a\nmunicipal policy was the ‘moving force’ behind the constitutional violation.  There are a\nnumber of ways in which a ‘policy’ can be set by a municipality to cause it to be liable\nunder § 1983: the explicit setting of a policy by the government that violates the\nConstitution, the action of a policy maker within the government, the adoption through a\nknowing failure to act by a policy maker of actions by his subordinates that are so\nconsistent that they have become ‘custom,’ or the failure of the government to respond to\na need (for example, training of employees) in such a manner as to show ‘deliberate\nindifference’ to the risk that not addressing the need will result in constitutional\nviolations.\nBaker v. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306-07 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal citations\nomitted).  \n6\n\nC.  Application to Plaintiffs’ Claims\n1.  Overdetention\nPlaintiffs allege that the District’s conduct amounts to a policy of deliberate indifference\nto their constitutional rights when it comes to processing the release of court-returned inmates,\nresulting in inmates being detained past the day on which they are entitled to release, and\nsometimes much longer.  There is a substantial body of law in support of the proposition that a\nplaintiff who alleges overdetention, sometimes even for a very short period, states a claim for\nconstitutional violations.  See, e.g., Berry v. Baca, 379 F.3d 764 (9th Cir. 2004); Lewis v.\nO’Grady, 853 F.2d 136 (7th Cir. 1988);  Jones v. Cochran, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20625 (S.D.\nFla. 1994); Parilla v. Eslinger, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34747 (M.D. Fla. 2005); Arline v. City of\nJacksonville, 359 F.Supp. 2d 1300, 1309-10 (M.D. Fla. 2005).  \nAs in Bynum, the District counters only with the excuse that some delays are inevitable\ndue to administrative needs.  But evaluating the factors that contribute to delay “are issues of\nfact, however, not matters of law.”  Berry v. Baca, 379 F.3d 764, 769 (9th Cir. 2004).  The record\nhas not been developed to the point where these issues can be addressed.  Further, the District is\nessentially arguing for a rule that certain delays, at least those of a day or two, are per se\nreasonable.  Yet it remains the case that “[c]ourts have not settled on any concrete number of\npermissible hours of delay in the context of post-release detentions.”  Berry, 379 F.3d at 771. \nThe operative word there is “hours”: the great weight of precedent suggests that release must\noccur within a matter of hours after the right to it accrues, and that after some period of hours –\nnot days – a presumption of unreasonableness, and thus unconstitutionality, will set in.\nThe District continues to mistakenly rely on County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S.\n7\n\n44 (1991) as allowing it a 48-hour window in which to tend to administrative matters.  In\nMcLaughlin the Court ruled that delays of 48 hours or more between arrest and a probable cause\nhearing were presumptively unreasonable, and that defendants whose hearings took place less\nthan 48 hours after arrest had to establish unreasonableness on a case-by-case basis.  In the case\nof probable cause hearings, the administrative burdens on the state are far greater than in this\ncase, and the societal interest at issue – determining whether there is probable cause that a crime\nhas been committed – is far greater than the societal interest in a case like this.  In a case such as\nthis, the only societal interests that justify delay are ensuring that prisoners are not released if\nthey have other detainers or warrants, and efficient marshaling of scarce resources.  Furthermore,\nat issue in McLaughlin was the procedural, albeit very important, right to a prompt probable\ncause hearing.  In a case such as this one, the issue is the prisoner’s absolute right to freedom. \nFor these reasons, the point at which overdetention becomes presumptively unreasonable is likely\nto fall well short of the 48-hour window in McLaughlin.  See Berry, 379 F.3d at 771-73\n(analyzing McLaughlin in the context of overdetention); Brass v. County of Los Angeles, 328\nF.3d 1192 (9th Cir. 2003) (same); Lewis v. O’Grady, 853 F.2d 1366 (7th Cir. 1988) (rejecting\npossibility that there can be a per se reasonable period in overdetention cases).  \nPlaintiffs assert that overdetention violates the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments. \nThey do not explain how their factual allegations line up with the elements of these claims, but\nthen again, they need not do so at this stage.  Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics\nIntelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993).  Most courts that have considered\noverdetention claims have agreed that they are properly channeled through the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment – and the Court construes plaintiffs’ invocation of the Fifth\n8\n\nAmendment as a reference to the identical provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, which\napplies to the States and the District of Columbia.  The Court follows those cases in holding that\nthese plaintiffs state cognizable claims for deprivation of liberty without due process of law.  See,\ne.g., Cannon v. Macon County, 1 F.3d 1558, 1562-63 (11th Cir. 1993); Berry v. Baca, 379 F.3d\n764 (9th Cir. 2004); Lewis v. O’Grady, 853 F.2d 136 (7th Cir. 1988);  Jones v. Cochran, 1994\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 20625 (S.D. Fla. 1994); Parilla v. Eslinger, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34747\n(M.D. Fla. 2005); Arline v. City of Jacksonville, 359 F.Supp. 2d 1300, 1309-10 (M.D. Fla. 2005). \nThe Complaint also states a valid Fourth Amendment claim.  Plaintiffs allege that, despite\nbeing entitled to release, they were taken back into custody and transported to D.C. Jail or CTF. \nOn the face of the complaint, they allege that they essentially were re-arrested or re-seized. \nThese allegations of Fourth Amendment violations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss,\nand further development of the record should disclose whether the seizures were reasonable.  See\nArline v. City of Jacksonville, 359 F.Supp. 2d 1300 (M.D. Fla. 2005); Jones v. Cochran, 1994\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 20625, at *13-17 (S.D. Fla. 1994).  On the other hand, plaintiffs do not allege\nthat overdetention was imposed as some sort of punishment, and thus do not state a claim under\nthe Eighth Amendment.  \nPlaintiffs adequately allege that overdetention is the result of District custom or policy for\nthe purposes of § 1983.  They allege, in essence, that the inefficient implementation of the\nDistrict’s release procedures is the result of official “acquiescence in a longstanding practice or\ncustom which constitutes the standard operation procedure of the local government entity.”  Jett\nv. Dallas Indep. School District, 491 U.S. 701, 737 (1989); see also Triplett v. District of\nColumbia, 108 F.3d 1450, 1453 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (municipal liability under § 1983 may be\n9\n\nfounded on “inaction giving rise to or endorsing a custom”).  The conduct at issue can be phrased\nin a variety of ways, such as “a policy of inaction [where] such inaction amounts to a failure to\nprotect constitutional rights.”  Berry, 379 F.3d at 767 (quoting Oviatt v. Pearce, 954 F.2d 1470,\n1474 (9th Cir. 1992)).  No matter how it is worded, plaintiffs have clearly alleged a policy or\ncustom that will support municipal liability.\n2.  Strip Search\nThe Supreme Court has established the Fourth Amendment standard for judging the\nreasonableness of inmate searches, stressing that “each case requires a balancing of the need for\nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.  Courts must\nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.”  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S.\n520, 559 (1979) (analyzing searches in context of prison, not jail).  When essentially the same\nallegations as in this case were presented in Bynum, they were deemed sufficient to survive a\nmotion to dismiss.  See Bynum v. District of Columbia, 257 F. Supp. 2d 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2002).  The\nDistrict has not unearthed any factual distinction or change in the law that would cause the Court\nto revisit its prior holding.\nIn Bynum, the Court relied largely on the reasoning of Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 13378 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 20, 1998), in which a 12(b)(6) motion was denied on substantially\nsimilar facts: court returns who had been ordered released were instead returned to a central\nfacility and strip searched.  More recently, Judge Collyer of this District has noted that there is\nsubstantial precedent in other circuits for the proposition that a plaintiff states a claim for\nviolations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by alleging that jail officials “subjected\n10\n\nputative class members to blanket strip searches and visual cavity searches without a reasonable\nindividualized suspicion that the class members were concealing weapons or contraband.” \nJohnson v. District of Columbia, 461 F.Supp. 2d 48, 50 (D.D.C. 2006) (Collyer, J.).\nThe District argues that the searches are reasonable because they are incident to detention,\nbut does not identify the specific security concerns at issue, or why they apply to all court returns.\nThis assumes that if detention is justified, any strip search is justified without recourse to some\nindividualized suspicion.  But several courts have declined to dismiss claims based on blanket\nstrip search policies, whether or not the detention is justified.  See, e.g., In re: Nassau County\nStrip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219 (2d Cir. 2006); Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678, 682 (11th\nCir. 2000) (joining “every other circuit which has had occasion to review a similar policy” and\nholding jail’s policy unconstitutional because it failed to require reasonable suspicion as a\npredicate to strip searches); Doe v. Calumet City, 754 F.Supp. 1211, 1219 n.20 (N.D. Ill. 1990)\n(“An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied to detainees . . . cannot be\nconstitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security\nconcerns”); Parilla v. Eslinger, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34747 (M.D. Fla. 2005).\nIII.  Motion for Class Certification\nPlaintiffs have moved [7] for class certification, but the District has not responded,\ninstead asking for thirty days from the time the Court rules on its dispositive motions to file a\nresponse to the class certification motion. [26]  Plaintiffs object to this request.  The sole reason\nthe District advances for delaying its response until after dispositive motions are dealt with is that\na response may be unnecessary if the Court grants the motions, and if the Court denies them, the\nDistrict could better tailor its response.  \n11\n\nThis is precisely the justification that this Court rejected when the District declined to\nrespond to the Bynum plaintiffs’ motion to certify a subclass, based on the District’s assumption\nthat if the Court granted its pending summary judgment motion, the subclass certification issue\nwould be mooted.  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 214 F.R.D. 27, 30 (D.D.C. 2003).  The Court\nholds today, as it did then, that “such an assumption was unwarranted, given the fact that the\nissue of whether to certify a class (or subclass) proceeds without an examination of the merits of\nthe case . . ..”  Id.  Further, Rule 23(c) clearly states that “as soon as practicable after the\ncommencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether\nit is to be so maintained.”  \nIn Bynum the District had eight months in which to respond to the certification motion. \nThis Court ruled that because this was “more than enough time for defendant to have filed a brief\nin opposition to plaintiffs’ motion to certify the subclass, and because the mandate of Rule 23(c)\nis clear, the Court will not brook any further delay of the certification question.”  Id.  The Court\ndenied the District’s motion for a further enlargement of time and deemed it to have waived the\nright to file an opposition brief.  Id.  Here the District has had roughly ten months in which to\noppose the certification motion, including one extension of time, and has had the instructive\nexperience of seeing the exact position it takes here rejected in Bynum.  \nTherefore the District’s Motion [26] for an extension of time is denied and the District\nhas waived its right to brief any opposition to the certification motion.  While the Local Civil\nRules generally permit the Court to treat unopposed motions as conceded, see L.Cv.R. 7(b), the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure contemplate that the Court must find that the requirements of\nRule 23 are satisfied before certifying a class.  So, as it did in Bynum, the Court will review the\n12\n\nmerits of the certification motion without the aid of the District’s views.\nThe class certification determinations in this case are highly similar to those faced as to\nthe class and subclass in Bynum, and the Court will refer frequently to the two opinions dealing\nwith those issues.  See Bynum v. District of Columbia, 214 F.R.D. 27 (D.D.C. 2003); Bynum v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 217 F.R.D. 43 (D.D.C. 2003).  It is also worth noting that Bynum was\nhardly novel.  There have been a number of class actions dealing with essentially the same\noverdetention and strip search issues.  See, e.g., Parilla v. Eslinger, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n34747 (M.D. Fla. 2005); Jones v. Cochran, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20625 (S.D. Fla. 1994).  \n“The party requesting class certification under Rule 23 bears the burden of showing the\nexistence of a class, that all the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, and that the class falls\nwithin one of the categories of Rule 23(b).”  Franklin v. Barry, 909 F.Supp. 21, 30 (D.D.C.\n1995) (Green, J.).  While the evidence cited in support of class certification may be the same\nevidence plaintiffs intend to use to prove their case, the class certification analysis is not a merits\ninquiry.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. 27, 31.  Plaintiffs must establish a “reasonable basis” for crediting\ntheir allegations that the requirements of Rule 23 are met.  Id. (quoting Wagner v. Taylor, 836\nF.2d 578, 587 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (internal quotation omitted)); see also Eisen v. Carlisle &\nJacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178 (1974).\nTo certify a class under Rule 23, a court first must determine that a class exists, then must\ndecide that the four predicates of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, and finally must find that at least one\nof Rule 23(b)’s provisions applies.  As discussed below, each of these prerequisites has been\nestablished.  \n13\n\nA.  Existence of Class\n“It is axiomatic that for a class action to be certified a ‘class’ must exist.”  Simer v. Rios,\n661 F.2d 655, 669 (7th Cir. 1981).  As explained in Bynum:\n[A]lthough Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not specifically require \nplaintiffs to establish that a class exists, this is a common-sense requirement and courts\nroutinely require it.  The requirement that a class be clearly defined is designed primarily\nto help the trial court manage the class.  It is not designed to be a particularly stringent\ntest, but plaintiffs must at least be able to establish that the general outlines of the\nmembership of the class are determinable at the outset of the litigation.  In other words,\nthe class must be sufficiently definite that it is administratively feasible for the court to\ndetermine whether a particular individual is a member.\nBynum, 214 F.R.D. at 31 (quoting Pigford v. Glickman, 182 F.R.D. 341, 346 (D.D.C. 1998)\n(Friedman, J.)).  \nAs set forth in the Second Amended Complaint, the Overdetention Class is defined as:\nEach person who has been, is, or in the future will be incarcerated in any District of\nColumbia Department of Corrections facility from September 1, 2005 forward; and who\nwas not released, or, in the future, will not be released by midnight on the date on which\nthe person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for his or\nher detention has otherwise expired. \nSee 2AC at 25; Motion [7] for Class Certification at 12.  The definition of the Strip Search class\nis much more lengthy:\nEach person who was, or in the future will be, from September 1, 2005, forward: (i) in the\ncustody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to court from a Department of\nCorrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to\nrelease by virtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had been held\nwas no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own\nrecognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was\notherwise entitled to release; (iv) was not the subject of any other pending cases or cases\nwhich imposed any condition of release other than personal recognizance; (v) was not the\nsubject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was returned from court to the DC Jail or CTF or\nother District facility, to be processed out of Department of Corrections custody; and (vii)\nwas subject to a strip search and/or visual body cavity search without any individualized\n14\n\nfinding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that was concealing contraband or\nweapons; before being released, regardless of whether he was overdetained.  \nSee 2AC at 26; Motion [7] for Class Certification at 34.\nAs to the Overdetention Class, its definition is identical to that used in Bynum, which the\nCourt approved because “an individual would be able to determine, simply by reading the\ndefinition, whether he or she was a member of the proposed class.”  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 32. \nThe Court later held the same to be true of the Strip Search class in Bynum, which employed the\nsame definition proffered here.  Bynum, 217 F.R.D. at 46.  The same definitions and extremely\nsimilar facts in this case augur the same result: none of the terms in the definitions require further\nclarification or individual hearings to determine class membership, and plaintiffs have\ndemonstrated the existence of identifiable classes.  \nB.  Rule 23(a) Requirements\n1. Numerosity\nThe first requirement of Rule 23(a) is that “the class is so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable.”  This prong “requires examination of the specific facts of each case\nand imposes no absolute limitations.”  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 32 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the\nNorthwest, Inc. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 33 (1980)).  As the Court has noted, in most cases a\nclass of at least forty members presumptively satisfies the impracticability of joinder\nrequirement, though classes as small as twenty might be appropriate.  Id. (citing Consolidated\nRail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1993) (numerosity presumed at forty\nclass members)).  If a plaintiff can provide a reasonable basis supporting an estimate, this will\nsuffice instead of an exact figure.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 32-33 (citing Kifafi v. Hilton Hotels\n15\n\nRetirement Plan, 189 F.R.D. 174, 176 (D.D.C. 1999) (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); Pigford v. Glickman,\n182 F.R.D. 341, 347 (D.D.C. 1998) (Friedman, J.); Vargas v. Meese, 119 F.R.D. 291, 293\n(D.D.C. 1987) (Gasch, J.)).\nPlaintiffs have submitted affidavits from almost forty individuals who claim to have been\noverdetained, and from roughly thirty who claim to have been strip searched.  This alone would\nsatisfy the tandem numerosity-impracticability requirements, and plaintiffs go further by positing,\nas they did in Bynum, a rough formula by which they estimate that many more class members\nwill be found through discovery.  With a proposed class containing thirty-some identified\nmembers, with many others potentially waiting in the wings, it would be impracticable to try the\nmatter by joinder.  \n2. Commonality\nUnder Rule 23(a)(2) there must also be “questions of law or fact common to the class” for\ncertification to be appropriate.  Commonality need not be complete; the class members do not\nhave to have every issue of law and fact in common.  See Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 33 (citing\nForbush v. J.C. Penney, Inc., 994 F.2d 1101, 1106 (5th Cir. 1993)).  If “there is some aspect or\nfeature of the claims which is common to all,” the requirement is met.  Pendleton v. Schlesinger,\n73 F.R.D. 506, 508 (D.D.C. 1977) (Smith, J.), aff’d, 628 F.2d 102 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  The same\ncommon questions that were raised, and never resolved, in Bynum are present in this case and\nsatisfy the commonality requirement, such as whether the overdetention and strip search practices\nwere municipal policies and whether either violated the Constitution.  See Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at\n34.  Regardless of any minor factual variations that might distinguish one class member from the\nnext, all members of each class will share those common questions.\n16\n\n3. Typicality\nThe class representatives are the focus of Rule 23(a)(3), which requires that “the claims\nor defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  “The\ntypicality requirement ensures that the claims of the representative and absent class members are\nsufficiently similar so that the representatives’ acts are also acts on behalf of, and safeguard the\ninterests of, the class.”  Littlewolf v. Hodel, 681 F.Supp. 929, 935 (D.D.C. 1988) (Richey, J.). \nThe requirement, which is liberally construed, see In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 209 F.R.D. 251,\n260 (D.D.C. 2002) (Hogan, C.J.), dictates that “[a] plaintiff’s claim is typical if it arises from the\nsame event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to a claim of another class member’s\nwhere his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.”  Stewart v. Rubin, 948 F.Supp. 1077,\n1088 (D.D.C. 1996) (Lamberth, J.).  Similarly to commonality, typicality is not destroyed simply\nbecause there are some factual variations between claims of the representatives and other class\nmembers.  See Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 34 (citing Wagner v. Taylor, 836 F.3d 578, 591 (D.C. Cir.\n1987); United States v. Trucking Employers, Inc., 75 F.R.D. 682, 688 (D.D.C. 1977) (Bryant, J.)\n(collecting cases)).\nThe claims here are identical to those in Bynum.  Each plaintiff pursues the same legal\ntheory, with no real variation, and they all allege generally similar facts, with variations only in\nthe length of overdetention or number of cited strip searches.  Typicality is satisfied here just as it\nwas in Bynum.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 34-35.  \n4.  Adequacy of Representation \nThe last requirement of Rule 23(a) is a showing that “the representative parties will fairly\nand adequately represent the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  This prong aims to\n17\n\nensure that the named representatives do not have interests antagonistic to those of the class\nmembers they represent, and that they will vigorously pursue the claims of the class through\nqualified counsel.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 35 (citing Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia,\n117 F.3d 571, 575 (D.C. Cir. 1997); National Association of Regional Medical Programs, Inc. v.\nMathews, 551 F.2d 340, 345 (D.C. Cir. 1976)).  \nIn terms of intra-class conflicts, the Court does not identify any that would imperil an\nadequacy finding.  All class members seek substantially similar relief and, at least to date, the\nrange of overdetention periods is relatively small, such that there is little tension between class\nmembers who might want to quickly settle small claims versus class members with potentially\nlarger claims.  See Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 35-36.  Finally, the adequacy of class counsel is well\nestablished.  In addition to submitting affidavits setting forth the considerable experience of class\ncounsel, both in general and in class action civil rights litigation, the qualifications of counsel are\nalso established by their participation in Bynum and other class action litigation dealing with\nprecisely the same factual, legal, and procedural questions at issue in this case.  These class\ncounsel were qualified in Bynum, and are even more so after that experience.  See Bynum, 214\nF.R.D. at 36-37.\nC.  Rule 23(b) Requirements\nOnce Rule 23(a)’s requirements are met, a putative class must demonstrate that it fits\nunder one of Rule 23(b)’s class types.  Plaintiffs seek to certify both the Overdetention Class and\nthe Strip Search Class as “hybrid classes” under both Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).  \n1.  Appropriateness of Equitable Relief\nTo certify a 23(b)(2) class for injunctive or declaratory relief, plaintiffs must demonstrate\n18\n\nthat “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to\nthe class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief\nwith respect to the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  The provision requires “(1) that\ndefendant’s actions are ‘generally applicable to the class’ and (2) that plaintiffs seek final\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief on behalf of the class.”  Bynum, 214 F.R.D.\nat 37.  In Bynum, the Court noted that it was sufficient to show that a defendant “has acted in a\nconsistent manner toward members of the class so that his actions may be viewed as part of a\npattern of activity.”  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 37 (quoting 7A WRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1775 (2d ed. 1986)); see also Jones v. Goord, 190 F.R.D.\n103, 112 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (certifying (b)(2) class of prisoners alleging unconstitutional practice\nof double-celling, “notwithstanding defendants’ argument that matters such as inmate screening\nis done on a case-by-case basis by different prison officials at different facilities”). \nIn this case, plaintiffs allege systemic failure that results in overdetention, and a system-\nwide policy of strip searches.  Though each violation complained of may have its own unique\nfacts, “the fact remains that, on the facts alleged by plaintiffs, the overdetentions [and strip\nsearches] do not appear to be isolated instances, but instead represent part of a consistent pattern\nof activity on the part of defendant.”  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 38.  The policies and practices\nchallenged here are conduct generally applicable to the members of the class.  \nRule 23(b)(2) also requires that plaintiffs seek final injunctive relief or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief.  Plaintiffs do seek such relief, and any question that could be raised about the\npredominance of money damages claims over the claims of injunctive or declaratory relief, and\nthe attendant risks of damage to class cohesiveness, are addressed by certifying this as a hybrid\n19\n\n23(b)(2) and (b)(3) class, as the Court did in Bynum.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 41; see also Eubanks\nv. Billington, 110 F.3d 87, 96 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Taylor v. D.C. Water & Sewer Authority, 2007\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 17737 at *43-44 (D.D.C. Mar. 13, 2007) (Kennedy, J.).  \n2.  Predominance of Common Questions of Law \nTo certify a class for money damages under Rule 23(b)(3), the Court must find that “the\nquestions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions\naffecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods\nfor the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.”  Factors to be considered in this\ncalculus are:\n(A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or\ndefense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the\ncontroversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability\nor undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D)\nthe difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  These considerations can be grouped along two basic lines:\npredominance and superiority.  The first consideration duplicates the commonality analysis in\nmany respects, delving further into an inquiry of the relative importance of the common issues to\nthe case.  See Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 39.  The dominant issues in this case, as in Bynum, go to\nliability – whether the overdetentions amount to an unconstitutional municipal policy and\nwhether the strip search policy is similarly unconstitutional.  Id. at 39-40.  These issues dwarf\nwhatever unique issues might arise at the damages stage.  The common factual and legal issues in\nthis case predominate over any issues applicable to individual members alone.  \nSuperiority is also satisfied here.  The second prong of Rule 23(b)(3) militates in favor of\n20\n\nclass actions where common legal or factual questions allow a court to “consolidate otherwise\nidentical actions into a single efficient unit.”  Wells v. Allstate Ins. Co., 210 F.R.D. 1, 12 (D.D.C.\n2002) (Oberdorfer, J.) (quoting Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167, 189 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).  In cases\nsuch as this, involving many extremely similar claims against the same defendant, class\ncertification promises greater efficiency and consistency than serial litigation of nearly identical\nindividual cases.  The superiority of the class action device becomes all the more apparent when\nit is revealed that the potential damages for each award may be small, indicating that the\nalternative of multiple individual suits may be an impossible way of vindicating the rights at\nissue.  See Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 40; Anderson v. Cornejo, 199 F.R.D. 228, 243 (N.D. Ill. 2000);\nSmith v. Montgomery County, 573 F.Supp. 604, 613 (D. Md. 1983).  \nThe manageability of the action is patent on its face: notice to class members can be\nachieved, in most cases, by mailing notice to the last known addresses provided by D.O.C.\ndatabases.  See Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 40-41.  Notice proceeded relatively smoothly in the Bynum\nclass action, and the claims administration in that case appears to have been proceeding with few\nglitches.  Given the experience class counsel received in that and other cases, there is every\nreason to hope that manageability will be even less of a concern in this case.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will certify this action as a hybrid (b)(2) and (b)(3)\nclass.  Specifically, the Court certifies a (b)(2) class with respect to plaintiffs’ claims for\ninjunctive and declaratory relief, and a (b)(3) class with respect to claims for monetary damages. \nThere will be no opt-out right as to the (b)(2) class, but there will be a right to opt-out in the\n(b)(3) class.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n21\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Motions [14 & 15] to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment\nare DENIED.  The District’s Motion [26] for an Extension of Time to respond to the motion for\nclass certification is DENIED.  Plaintiffs’ Motion [7] for Class Certification is GRANTED, and\nthe Court certifies this matter as a class action as described above.  Plaintiffs’ Motions [24 & 30]\nfor Discovery are DENIED without prejudice, and plaintiffs’ Rule 56(f) Motion [20] for\nextension of time to respond to summary judgment is DENIED as moot.  The parties shall meet\nand confer within ten days of this date and submit a proposed scheduling order to the Court\noutlining timetables for discovery and submission of dispositive motions.\nA separate Order shall issue this date.\nSigned by United States District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, March 26, 2007.    \n22",

This is an action brought by each of Carl A.  Barnes, \nDernard Hawkins, David Peterson, Toney James Malloy and \nMaurice Williams (the \"Overdetention Named Plaintiffs\") on his own \nbehalf and on behalf of the class defined below injured (or presently \nsubject to injury) by the Government of the District of Columbia's \n2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 3 of 41\nrecently revived pattern and practice of allowing its Department of \nCorrections to overdetain inmates, and by the District's deliberate \nindifference to the effect of the practice of overdetention on the \nrights of inmates.  To overdetain means holding a detainee or \nprisoner in a District of Columbia Department of Corrections \n(\"Department of Corrections\") facility past midnight of his or her \nrelease date, as defined below. \n2.  This is also an action brought by Carl A.  Barnes, David \nPeterson, Toney James Malloy and Maurice Williams (the \"Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs\") on his own behalf and on behalf of a Strip \nSearch Class of individuals who were injured (or presently subject \nto injury) by the District's conduct in subjecting them to blanket \nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches (both described \nbelow) after they were returned to a Department of Corrections \nfacility after a judicial determination that there was no longer a \nbasis for their detention, other than to be processed for release, and \nby District's deliberate indifference to the effect of the practice of \nblanket strip searches and visual body cavity searches on the rights \nof inmates. \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 4 of 41\n3.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs bring this action \nagainst the Government of the District of Columbia under Section \n1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. §  1983, to enforce \nthe Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendments, for injuries suffered by \nthem, because the District overdetained them and other members of \nthe class at a Department of Corrections facility. \n4.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action \nagainst the Government of the District of Columbia under Section \n1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S. C. § 1983, to enforce \nthe Fourth and Fifth Amendments, for injuries suffered by them, \nbecause the District subjected them and the class to the blanket \nstrip searches. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Overdetained Named \nPlaintiffs and Strip Search Named Plaintiffs' §  1983 claims \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1331 and 28 U.S.C. §  1343(a)(3). \n6.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  Each of the claims \nfor relief arose in this judicial district. \n4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 5 of 41\nClass Action Allegations \n7.  The Court certified these two classes under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) and (b)(3) and certified all named plaintiffs named in the \nSecond Amended Complaint as named plaintiffs in an order dated 3/26/07 \n(docket # 33). \n8.  Plaintiffs have moved separately to add Ms. Jones as a named plaintiff \nfor each of the classes. \n9.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2)  and 23(b)(3), of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of:  (a) Each person who \nhas been, is, or in the future will be incarcerated in any District of \nColumbia Department of Corrections facility from September 1, \n2005 forward; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future, will \nnot be released by midnight on the date on which the person is \nentitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis \nfor his or her detention has otherwise expired. \n10.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs also bring this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2)  and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a  class consisting of each member of the \nclass who was, or in the future will be, from September 1,2005, \n5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 6 of 41\nforward: (i)  in the custody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) \ntaken to court from a Department of Corrections facility; (iii) \nordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to \nrelease by virtue of the court appearance because the charge on \nwhich he had been held was no longer pending or was dismissed at \nthe hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or had \nposted bail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was \notherwise entitled to release; (iv) was not the subject of any other \npending case or cases which imposed any condition of release other \nthan personal recognizance; (v) was not the subject of any detainer \nor warrant; (vi) was returned from court to the DC Jailor CTF or \nother District facility, to be processed out of Department of \nCorrections custody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search \nand/ or visual body cavity search without any individualized finding \nof reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was concealing \ncontraband or weapons; before being released, regardless of \nwhether he was overdetained. \n11.  Certification of these two classes under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) was and remains appropriate, because the \n6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 7 of 41\nDistrict of Columbia has a pattern and practice that has uniformly \naffected all members of both classes, and injunctive relief against \nthe District will benefit each and every plaintiff and class member. \nAlthough the District had agreed to stop these practices, and indeed \nhad done so in the context of the settlement of Bynum v.  District of \nColumbia, Civil Action No. 02-956 (RCL), the final approval order \ndid not require that the practices stop. These practices continued \nafter the Bynum Settlement making it clear that a court order is \nnecessary to ensure the rights of the class members. \n12.  The classes are entitled to injunctive relief, for example, \nsetting up an independent monitor to supervise the Department of \nCorrections' inmate management system to ensure that all inmates \nare released on or before their release dates, and other relief as \nspecified below. Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(3) was and remains also appropriate, in that common questions of law \nand fact predominate over any individual questions, and a class action is \nsuperior for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy as detailed \nbelow. \n7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 8 of 41\n13.  Regarding the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs, and members of \nthe Overdetention Class, there are no individual questions on the \nissue of liability other than whether an individual has been \noverdetained, and the answer to that question can be determined by \nministerial inspection of the Department of Corrections' records. \n14.  Computer records are available for inspection on the \noverdeten tions. \n15.  Regarding the Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and members of \nthe Strip Search Class, there are no individual questions on the \nissue of liability, because neither the DC Jail nor CTF keeps records \nof the searches and therefore neither the DC Jail nor CTF can show \nthat any of the searches were conducted based on an individual \ndetermination of reasonable suspicion. \n16.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the classes \nare: \na)  whether the Constitution provides a \nmaximum length of time measured in hours beyond \nwhich the District cannot hold a person to perform \n8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 9 of 41\nadministrative tasks incident to release before releasing \nthat person from jail; \nb)  whether the District has exceeded that \nmaximum for each class member; \nc)  whether the District has a pattern and practice \nof holding detainees and inmates past their release dates; \nd)  whether the District has a pattern and practice \nof being deliberately indifferent to the rights of detainees \nand inmates by holding them past their release dates; \ne)  whether the District's acts as alleged herein \nviolate the Constitution of the United States by holding \ndetainees and inmates past their release dates; \nf)  whether the District has a policy of and \npractice of subjecting persons to blanket strip searches \nand visual body cavity searches after they have become \nentitled to release; \ng)  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourth and/ or Fifth Amendments; \n9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 10 of 41\nh)  whether plaintiffs and the members of the \nOverdetention Class and the Strip Search Class and \nfuture members are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, \nwhat is the nature of that relief; \ni.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for \ndetermination of all class members' damages except those who opt \nout. \n17.  Each of the Overdetention Class and the Strip Search Class is \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The \nexact number of Overdetention Class and Strip Search Class \nmembers numbers in the thousands. \n18.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, as plaintiffs and all other \nmembers of the class were injured by exactly the same means, that \nis, by the overdetentions. \n19.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the Strip Search Class, as the Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs and all other members of the Strip Search \n10 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 11 of 41\nClass were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the \nblanket strip searches. \n20.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and the Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe members of the Overdetention Class and Strip Search Class and \nhave retained counsel who are competent and experienced in \ncomplex federal civil rights class action litigation and/ or complex \nfederal prisoner rights litigation. \n21.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with \nthose of the class or Strip Search Class. \nParties \n22.  Plaintiff Carl A.  Barnes was currently being held past his \nRelease Date at the DC Jail as of the filing of this action and was \nstrip searched without reasonable suspicion after being ordered to \nbe released from custody. \n23.  Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins was currently being held past his \nRelease Date at the DC Jail as of the filing of this action. \n11 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 12 of 41\n24.  Plaintiff David Peterson was currently being held past his \nRelease Date at the DC Jail as of the filing of this action and was \nstrip searched without reasonable suspicion after being ordered to \nbe released from custody. \n25.  Plaintiff Maurice Williams was currently held in the DC Jail as \nof the filing of this action on a detention order in a traffic case that \nhad been vacated on 2/8/06.  He was scheduled for a hearing on a \nshow cause order for a probation violation on a misdemeanor case \nissued by a District of Columbia Superior Court Judge after which \nhe was likely to be further overdetained and subjected to an illegal \ncourt return strip search. \n26.  Plaintiff Toney James Malloy is an inmate in the custody of the \nDepartment of Corrections who as of the time of the filing of the \nfirst amended complaint was being held in the District of Columbia \nSuperior Court lock up for return to the DC Jailor the holding \nfacility at DC General after being sentenced to probation with no \nconfinement with no other charges on which he was being held, and \nat that time had no warrants, detainers or other basis for detention. \n12 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 13 of 41\n27.  Plaintiff Razina Jones was an inmate in the DC Jail who was ordered \nreleased at Superior Court on 2/28/06 and who was sUbjected to an illegal \nstrip search on 2/28/06 upon reentry to the DC Jail and released the next \nmorning. \n28.  The District Government of the District of Columbia \n(hereinafter the District of Columbia or the District) is a municipal \ncorporation capable of being sued under D.C. Code § 1-102. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nComponents of the Department of Corrections \n29.  The District of Columbia Department of Corrections holds \nprisoners committed by the District of Columbia Superior Court, \nthe District of Columbia District Court, and other agencies, in the \nCentral Detention Facility (\"DC Jail\"), the Correctional Treatment \nFacility (\"CTF\")  and at various halfway houses located in the District \nof Columbia. \n30.  Most prisoners held in the custody of the Department of \nCorrections are either pre-trial detainees, misdemeanants serving \nsentences, or parole and probation violators. \nThe Inmate Management System \n13 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 14 of 41\n31.  The records office located at the DC Jail (\"Records Office\") is \nresponsible for administering and maintaining the records, \nincluding the judgment and commitment files, of all persons housed \nat the DC Jail, CTF and the halfway houses. \n32.  The Records Office is also responsible for ensuring that all \npersons housed at the DC Jail, CTF and the halfway houses are \nreleased according to their Release Dates specified in their \ndispositions and court orders. \n33.  The District of Columbia Superior Court has a policy pursuant \nto which an in-custody-defendant or a defendant ordered into \ncustody may not leave the courtroom without an order \n(commitment order or release order) for each case on which he \nappeared. \nThe Overdetention Problem \n34.  \"Overdetain\" means holding a detainee or prisoner in \nDepartment of Corrections' custody past the person's release date. \n35.  \"Release Date\" for each detainee or inmate is the day on which \nthe person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on \nwhich the basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired. \n14 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 15 of 41\n36.  \"Exit Date\" for each detainee or inmate is the day on which the \nperson is actually released from the custody of the District of \nColumbia Department of Corrections. \n37.  The Department of Corrections had a long and documented \nhistory of overdetaining detainees and inmates past their release \ndates. \n38.  The Department of Corrections, in response to a class action \nlawsuit, for a brief period in 2005 ameliorated the overdetention \nproblem. \n39.  However, since at least November 2005, the Department of \nCorrections again begun overdetaining large numbers of inmates. \n40.  The rate of overdetentions, after dipping in early 2005, spiked \nin late 2005 and by January 2006 had exceeded the over detention \nrate prevailing in late 2004 .. \n15 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 16 of 41\nThe Court Return Strip Search Problem \n41.  Prior to late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of \nCorrections followed a practice under which most inmates taken \nfrom custody of the Department of Corrections to court and ordered \nreleased by a judicial officer because the charge was no longer \npending or because of a change in conditions of release was \nreturned to the DC Jailor CTF for processing for release rather \nthan being released from the courthouse. \n42.  In late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of Corrections \ninstituted a policy under which every inmates taken from custody of \nthe Department of Corrections to court and ordered released by a \njudicial officer because the charge was no longer pending or \nbecause of a change in conditions of release was returned to the DC \nJailor CTF for processing for release rather than being released \nfrom the courthouse. \n43.  From the beginning of the class period (9/1/05) until July 2008 virtually \nall court returns were released from MHU (the Medical Holding Unit (\"MHU\") or \nis a holding facility at the old DC General Hospital defined below) or the DC \nJail. \n16 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 17 of 41\n44.  As a result, because the DC Jail and CTF had then and now \npolicies of subjecting all inmates (new intakes and court returns) to \nblanket strip searches upon entering the facilities, all court returns \nentitled to release sent back to the DC Jail and CTF after their court \nappearances suffered blanket strip searches. \n45.  The strip searches ofi nmates entering the DC Jail and CTF \ndescribed herein are strip searches of inmates in groups of several \ninmates at once. \n46.  In 2005 the Department of Corrections instituted a program \n(which was not reduced to a program statement or post order) of \ndiverting some in-custody defendants ordered released or otherwise \nentitled to release from the Superior Court of the District of \nColumbia to a holding facility on the grounds of DC General \nHospital where they would not be subject to a strip search, absent \nindividualized suspicion, while the record review for detainers and \nwarrants and property retrieval was conducted prior to release, \nproviding the release could be effected before 10:00 p.m. \n17 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 18 of 41\n47.  All other court returns (including court returns entitled to \nrelease) were returned to the DC Jailor CTF and sUbjected to \nblanket strip searches. \n48.  In 2008 the DOC began releasing some court returns from the Superior \nCourt but DOC has continued to release some court returns from MHU and the \nDC Jail. \n49.  The cause of the over-detentions and illegal post release strip searches of \ncourt returns entitled to release was and remains the District of Columbia's \nmaintaining a release system in the DOC which in toto simply delays all \nreleases until the system, in its sweet time, and with the resources the \ngovernment of the District of Columbia chooses provide it, is ready to make \nreleases of inmates from DOC facilities \n50.  The system attaches weight to the governmental interests involved in \nreleases but disregarded the interests of the inmate in a prompt release. \n18 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 19 of 41\n51.  The over-detention problem and resultant post release strip search \nproblem remained especially severe in the first year after the termination of the \nBynum class period because of the problems with the DOC's release system \nincluding not enough time to release in-custody defendants returning from \ncourt appearances because of the 10 pm cutoff imposed by D.C. Code § 24-\n21 1. 2 (b)(6), failing to adequately staff the Records Office and other positions \ninvolved in the release process, re-committing court returns back into the DC \nJailor CTF without regard to the disposition of their court cases, back-log, and \nawaiting juvenile releases, losing track of inmates going to court and re \nadmitting them to the DC Jailor CTF and subjecting them to blanket strip \nsearches without court orders and thus without knowing whether they were \nordered continued held or ordered released  (causing over detentions and post \nrelease strip searches), not making in-court releases until July 2008, having no \nprogram for identifying at court persons who needed meds, relying on a \nsneaker network to deliver court orders from the courts to the Records Office \nstaff, staff not following the Records Office manual, relyingon paper records to \nprocess commitments and releases (instead of JACCS, the DOC's computerized \ninmate population accounting system) and the deliberate indifference of \nthe acting warden Patricia Britton and the acting director Elwood \nYork and the resignation of competent managers from the Records \nOffice and the failure to replace them (or in some cases a combination of \n19 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 20 of 41\nthese factors).  The DOC never effectively addressed these problems in the \nrelease process despite the Bynum case and promises of reform. \n52.  The Department of Corrections, in response to a class action lawsuit, \nagreed to institute reforms to ameliorate the over-detention problem and the \nstrip search problem.  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 412 F.Supp.2d 73, 83 \n(D.D.C. 2006)(final approval order). \n53.  However, the over-detentions and illegal strip searches continued even \nafter the Bynum class period ended on 8/31/05 and continued practically \nunabated throughout the first 18 months of the class period. \n54.  Plaintiffs' statistical analysis shows that in six of the first 12 months of \nthe class period, over 50 percent of court returns entitled to release were \npotentially over-detained, and the rate was almost always above 30 percent \nthrough March 2007. (A strong correlation exists between the number of \npotential over detentions and the number of actual over detentions.) \n55.  Additionally, Plaintiffs reviewed the raw data underlying the District's \nanalysis of the approximately 6,000 releases identified by the District's script \nor query (computer code that extracts data from a larger data set) for \nidentifying potential over detentions and for the first year after the Bynum \nclass period/ first year of this class period Plaintiffs identified 2,050 actual \nover-detentions, 1,280 on-time releases, and 2,619 releases in which the over \ndetention status could not be determined based on the data. \n20 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 21 of 41\n56.  The District's analysis identified over 1,200 inmates held past their \nRelease Dates during the first year of this class period alone which the District \nattributed solely or in part to the 10:00 pm cut-off rule. \n57.  The numbers of overdetentions and overdetention hours in the first year \nof the Barnes class period is at least 2,547 and 74,411, respectively. \n58.  The number of these over detained court returns entitled to release \nsubjected to post release strip searches in the first-year of the class period is at \nleast 2,351. \n59.  While persons entitled to release because of completion of sentence had a \nconsistently lower potential overdetention rate than court returns entitled to \nrelease, persons entitled to release because of completion of sentence also \nexhibited relatively higher potential overdetention rates during the first year of \nthe Barnes class period in comparison to more recent years.  Six of the first 12 \nmonths show a potential overdetention rate above 15 percent, whereas this \nrate is almost always at or below 10 percent beginning in November 2006. \n60.  The number of overdetentions for the whole overdetention class period to \ndate is at least between 4,432 and 4,540, and that the number of overdetention \nhours for the whole overdetention class period to date is at least between \n162,515 and 252120. \n21 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 22 of 41\n61.  DOC officials and City Council Members and the \n62.  Mayor were aware of these problems and the over detention \nand post release strip search problems, but remained deliberately \nindifferent to the risk of over detentions and post release strip \nsearches and acquiesced in the current overdetention and strip \nsearch problems. As part of the Bynum Settlement Agreement the DOC \nretained $3,000,000  for construction of a stand-alone inmate processing \ncenter (\"ICP\") \n63.  The IPC was intended to provide adequate processing facilities for \nintakes, releases, and associated records processing for inmates in DOC \nfacilities. \n64.  The IPC has not been constructed as of the data of filing of this amended \ncomplaint even though every year as part of its agency review the DOC informs \nthe City Council that the project has not been funded and remains un-built. \n65.  The DOC did not make courthouse releases (that is, identifying and \nreleasing court returns entitled to release directly from the Superior Court) \nfrom 2001 to 2008. \n66.  The Government of the District of Columbia has known based on \nanalyses provided by Bynum class counsel and reports of the courthouse \nrelease system employed in LA County that courthouse releases would speed \nreleases and reduce erroneous releases and over detentions. \n22 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 23 of 41\n67.  Bynum class counsel testified on these topics in November 2002 before \nthe District of Columbia City Council and that courthouse releases would \nspeed releases and reduce erroneous releases and over detentions. \n68.  Bynum class counsel prepared a courthouse release package and in \nabout 2004 sent it and the policies and procedures the LA County Sheriffs \nDepartment formulated for making courthouse releases to all stake holders \nincluding opposing counsel in the Bynum case. \n69.  The DOC finally began making some courthouse releases from the \nSuperior Court in July 2008. \n70.  For example, instead of devising a system for transmitting dispositions \ndirectly from the Superior Court judicial officers who made them to DOC \nRecords Office staff the District has for years relied on the Superior Court \nMarshal to transmit paper orders from courtrooms at the Superior Court and \nthe District Court to the Records Office or other DOC staff, even when the \nDistrict knew this system causes delays in release of inmates. \n71.  The District did not even participate in an analysis of the \"sneaker \nnetwork\" system of delivering court orders and other paperwork for court \nreturns until late 2007. \n72.  The District did not even make substantive additions to Records Office \nstaff until late 2007 even though the DOC has known for years that the \nRecords Office was understaffed to the point it could not promptly and reliably \nprocess commitments and releases. \n23 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 24 of 41\nCarl A.

Instead of being released at Superior Court, Razina Jones was returned \nto DC Jail on 2/28/06, \n92.  She was not released from DC Jail until the morning of 3/ 1/06 because \nthere was not enough time to release her before the 10 pm cutoff after her \ncourt appearance on 2/28/06. \n93.

Plaintiff David Peterson was entitled to release on 2/20/05. \n101. But, instead of being released from the holding facility at DC \nGeneral on 2/21/06, Plaintiff David Peterson was returned to the \nDC Jail's general population and subjected to a strip search and \nvisual body cavity search without any individualized finding of \nreasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was concealing \ncontraband or weapons even though a court had ordered his \nrelease. \n102. The guards at the DC Jail sUbjected Mr. Peterson to a post \nrelease strip search in front of about 5 guards and 75 other \ninmates. \n27 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 28 of 41\n103.

Plaintiff Maurice Williams at the time the First Amended \nComplaint was filed (2/24/06) was held in the DC Jail on a traffic \nhold that had been vacated 2/8/06.  He was the subject of a show \ncause order for probation violation in a misdemeanor case issued by \na District of Columbia Superior Court (but he was not subject to a \nhold in the misdemeanor probation case and the Records Office did \nnot show him as being held in the misdemeanor probation case), \nand he had a hearing scheduled for 2/27 / 06 in the misdemeanor \nprobation case, after which he was likely to be overdetained and \nsubjected to an illegal court return strip search.  The judge in the \nmisdemeanor probation case issued a release order at the 2/27/06 \nhearing (even though there was no hold in that case) but the DC \nJail continued to hold him on the traffic case (even though the \ntraffic hold had been vacated 2/8/06) until 3/1/06 even though the \nSuperior Court records showed that the traffic hold had been \ndischarged on 2/8/06.

The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all allegations set \nforth in the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n120. District of Columbia administrators, policy makers, \nsupervisors and employees caused the intentional, unjustified \noverdetention of the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and \nunreasonable strip searches of the Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nand all other class members and Strip Search Class members by \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional injury of \noverdetention in administering records relating to inmates' \ndetention and release, and maintaining and acquiescing in a policy \nand practice of strip searching certain inmates. \n32 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 33 of 41\n12l. Overdetaining any person violates that person's Fourth and \nFifth and Eighth Amendment rights. \n122. Unreasonably strip searching an inmate violates his Fourth \nand Fifth Amendment rights. \n123. District of Columbia employees continue in such conduct up \nto and including the present. \n124. At all relevant times such District of Columbia employees were \nacting within the scope of their employment, their acts were \nmotivated by a desire to further the interests of the District of \nColumbia, and such District of Columbia employees were acting in \nfurtherance of the business of the District of Columbia. \n125. The District is therefore liable by virtue of its deliberate \nindifference under 42 U .S.C. §  1983 for constitutional injuries to \nthe Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members and Strip Search Class \nmembers caused by the conduct of such employees. \n126. Accordingly, all Named Plaintiffs and class members are \nentitled to damages to be determined at trial, and the Overdetention \nand Strip Search Classes are entitled to injunctive relief. \n33 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 34 of 41\nCount 2 \n§ 1983 Monell Custom and Practice Direct Liability of District of \nColumbia for Violation of Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendment \nRights of Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and Class Members \n127. The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth in this Complaint. \n128. Beginning approximately in late December 2005, the District \nof Columbia, and its agents and employees, have had a custom of \ndetaining people past their release dates, thereby causing the \nintentional, unjustified overdetention of the Overdetained Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members. \n129. The District's actions, and failure to act, as described above, \ndirectly and proximately and affirmatively were the moving force \nbehind the violations of the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and all \nother class members' Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. \n130. Accordingly, all Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and \nOverdetention Class members are entitled to damages to be \ndetermined at trial, and the Overdetention Class is entitled to \ninjunctive relief. \n34 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 35 of 41\nCount 3 \n§ 1983 Monell Custom and Practice Direct Liability of District of \nColumbia for Violation of Fourth and Fifth Amendment Rights of \nStrip Search Named Plaintiffs and Strip Search Class Members for \nIllegal Strip Searches \n131. The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth in this Complaint. \n132. The District's actions, and failure to act, as described above, \ndirectly and proximately and affirmatively were the moving force \nbehind the violations of the Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and the \nStrip Search Class members' Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. \n133. Accordingly, Named Plaintiffs Barnes, Malloy and Petersen and \nthe Strip Search Class members are entitled to damages to be \ndetermined at trial, and the Strip Search Class is entitled to \ninjunctive relief. \n35 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 36 of 41\nIRREPARABLE INJURY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n134. The District is overdetaining members of the plaintiff \nOverdetention Class and unreasonably subjecting members of the \nStrip Search Class to strip searches and visual body cavity \nsearches, which irreparably harms them, even if they are later able \nto recover compensatory damages. \n135. The District's overdetaining members of the plaintiff \nOverdeten tion Class and performing illegally strip searches of the \nplaintiff Strip Search Class has irreparably harmed, and will \ncontinue to irreparably harm, members of the proposed plaintiff \nOverdetention Class and Strip Search Class, thus making \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief necessary. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court \ngrant the following relief: \n1.  grant a jury trial on all claims so triable; \n2.  declare that this action may be maintained as a class \naction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and Rule \n36 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 37 of 41\n23(b)(3) and certifying the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs as the \nproper representative of the class consisting of: \n(a) Each person who has been, is, or will be incarcerated \nin any District of Columbia Department of Corrections facility \nfrom 9/1/05 up to and until the date this case is terminated; \nand (b) who was not released, or, in the future, will not be \nreleased by midnight on the date on which the person is \nentitled to be released by court order or the date on which the \nbasis for his or her detention has otherwise expired. \n3.  declare that this action may be maintained as a class \naction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), 23(b) (2) \nand 23(b)(3) and certifying the Strip Search Named Plaintiffs as the \nproper representative of the Strip Search Class consisting of each \nmember of the class who was, or in the future will be, from 9/1/05, \nforward: \n(i)  was or will be in custody of the Department of \nCorrections; \n(ii) was or will be taken to court from a Department of \nCorrections facility; \n37 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 38 of 41\n(iii) was or will be ordered released by the court or \notherwise became entitled to release by virtue of the court \nappearance because the charge on which he had been held \nwas no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was \nordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, \nwas sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was otherwise \nentitled to release; \n(iv) was not or will not be the subject of any other \npending case or cases which imposed any condition of release \nother than personal recognizance; \n(v) was not or will not be the subject of any detainer or \nwarrant; \n(vi) was or will be returned to the DC Jailor CTF from \ncourt, to be processed out of Department of Corrections \ncustody; and \n(vii) was or will be subjected to a strip search and/ or \nvisual body cavity search without any individualized finding of \nreasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was concealing \ncontraband or weapons; \n38 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 39 of 41\n(viii) before being released, regardless of whether he was \nor will be overdetained. \n4.  declare that the Districts' acts alleged above violate the \nFourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution by \noverdetaining and illegally strip searching plaintiffs as alleged \nherein; \n5.  preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Districts from \npursuing the course of conduct complained of herein; \n6.  preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Districts from \npursuing settlement directly with any member of the putative \nOverd  etention Class and Strip Search Class described herein unless \nthat person is represented by counsel; \n7.  award all named plaintiffs compensatory and \nconsequential damages in an amount to be determined at trial; \n8.  appoint an independent monitor to supervise the Records \nOffice, and report to the court, to ensure that all inmates are \nreleased on or before their Release Dates, at the expense of \nDefendants; \n39 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 40 of 41\n9.  appoint an independent monitor to supervise the R&D \nOffices, and report to the court, to ensure that all detainees and \ninmates who have been ordered released are not strip searched or \nfull-body cavity searched; \n10.  award plaintiffs attorneys' fees and costs incurred in \nbringing this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n11.  grant such other relief as this Court deems just and \nproper. \n40 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329   Filed 01/20/11   Page 41 of 41\nRespectfully submitted, \n__/ sig/ _________  \nWILLIAM CLAIBORNE \nD.C.

The cause of the over-detentions and illegal pos1 release strip searches of \ncourt returns entitled to release was and remains the District of Columbia 's \nmaintaining a release svstem in the DOC which in toto simply delays all \nreleases until the system, in its sweet time, and with the resources the \ngovernment of the DIstrict of Columbia chooses provide it, is ready to make \nreleases of inmates from DOC facilities \n20 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 329-1   Filed 01/20/11   Page 21 of 45\n50.

The DOC never effectively addressed these problems in the \nrelease process despite the Bynum case and promises of reform. \n52.

Plaintiffs' statistical analysis shows that ifn six of the first 12 months of \nthe class period, over 50 percent of court returns entitled to release were \npotentially over-detained, and the rate was almost always above 30 percent \nthrough March 2007. (A strong correlation exists between the number of \npotential over detentions and the number of actual over detentions.) \n55.

The number of these over detamed court returns entitled to release \nsubjected to post release strip searches in the first-vear of the class period is at \nleast 2,351. \n59.

As part of the Bvnum Settlement Agreement the DOC retained \n$3,000,000  for construction of a stand-alone inmate processing center (\"ICF') \n63.

The DOC did not make courthouse releases (that is, Identifying and \nreleasing court returns entitled to release directh' from the Superior Court) \nfrom 2001 to 2008. \n66.  The Government of the District of Columbia has known based on \nanalyses provided by Bynum class counsel and reports of the courthouse \nrelease system employed in LA County that courthouse releases would speed \nreleases and reduce erroneous releases and over detentlOns. \n67.

The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action against the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights \n \n  3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 4 of 29(cid:10)\nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, for \ninjuries suffered by them, because the District subjected them and the class to the \nblanket strip searches. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs \nand Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nand 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3).   \n6.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  Each of the claims for relief \narose in this judicial district. \n \n  4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 5 of 29(cid:10)\nClass Action Allegations \n7.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules \n23(a), 23(b) (2) and 23(b)(3), of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of \na class consisting of: (a) Each person who has been, is, or in the future will be \nincarcerated in any District of Columbia Department of Corrections facility from \nSeptember 1, 2005 forward; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future, will \nnot be released by midnight on the date on which the person is entitled to be \nreleased by court order or the date on which the basis for his or her detention has \notherwise expired. \n8.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs also bring this action under Rules \n23(a), 23(b) (2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a \nclass consisting of each member of the class who was, or in the future will be, from \nSeptember 1, 2005, forward: (i) in the custody of the Department of Corrections; \n(ii) taken to court from a Department of Corrections facility; (iii) ordered released \nby the court or otherwise became entitled to release by virtue of the court \nappearance because the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending \nor was dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or \nhad posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was otherwise \nentitled to release; (iv) was not the subject of any other pending case or cases \n \n  5\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 6 of 29(cid:10)\nwhich imposed any condition of release other than personal recognizance; (v) was \nnot the subject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was returned from court to the DC \nJail or CTF or other District facility, to be processed out of Department of \nCorrections custody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or visual body \ncavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause that he was concealing contraband or weapons; before being \nreleased, regardless of whether he was overdetained. \n9.  Certification of these two classes under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate, because the District of Columbia has a pattern \nand practice that has uniformly affected all members of both classes, and injunctive \nrelief against the District will benefit each and every plaintiff and class member. \nAlthough the District had agreed to stop these practices, and indeed had done so in \nthe context of the settlement of Bynum v. District of Columbia , Civil Action No. \n02-956 (RCL), the final approval order did not require that the practices stop. \nThese practices have recently been revived, making it clear that a court order is \nnecessary to ensure the rights of the class members. \n10.  The classes are entitled to injunctive relief, for example, setting up an \nindependent monitor to supervise the Department of Corrections' inmate \n \n  6\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 7 of 29(cid:10)\nmanagement system to ensure that all inmates are released on or before their \nrelease dates, and other relief as specified below. \n10A.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(3) is also appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact \npredominate over any individual questions, and a class action is superior for \nthe fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n11.  Regarding the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs, and members of the \nOverdetention Class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability other \nthan whether an individual has been overdetained, and the answer to that question \ncan be determined by ministerial inspection of the Department of Corrections' \nrecords. \n12.  Computer records are available for inspection on the overdetentions.  \n13.  Regarding the Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and members of the \nStrip Search Class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, \nbecause neither the DC Jail nor CTF keeps records of the searches and therefore \nneither the DC Jail nor CTF can show that any of the searches were conducted \nbased on an individual determination of reasonable suspicion. \n14.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the classes are: \na)   whether the Constitution provides a maximum length of \ntime measured in hours beyond which the District cannot hold a \n \n  7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 8 of 29(cid:10)\nperson to perform administrative tasks incident to release before \nreleasing that person from jail;  \nb)   whether the District has exceeded that maximum for \neach class member; \nc)  whether the District has a pattern and practice of holding \ndetainees and inmates past their release dates; \nd)  whether the District has a pattern and practice of being \ndeliberately indifferent to the rights of detainees and inmates by \nholding them past their release dates; \ne)  whether the District’s acts as alleged herein violate the \nConstitution of the United States by holding detainees and inmates \npast their release dates; \nf)  whether the District has a policy of and practice of \nsubjecting persons to blanket strip searches and visual body cavity \nsearches after they have become entitled to release; \ng)  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth \nand/or Fifth Amendments; \n \n  8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 9 of 29(cid:10)\nh)  whether plaintiffs and the members of the Overdetention \nClass and the Strip Search Class and future members are entitled to \nequitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that relief; \ni.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for \ndetermination of all class members’ damages except those who opt \nout. \n15.  Each of the Overdetention Class and the Strip Search Class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The exact number of \nOverdetention Class and Strip Search Class members is unknown to plaintiffs at \nthis time, but is likely to consist of at least one hundred people, and likely \nsubstantially more than that. \n16.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims \nof the other members of the class, as plaintiffs and all other members of the class \nwere injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the overdetentions. \n17.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of \nthe other members of the Strip Search Class, as the Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nand all other members of the Strip Search Class were injured by exactly the same \nmeans, that is, by the blanket strip searches. \n \n  9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 10 of 29(cid:10)\n18.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and the Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the \nOverdetention Class and Strip Search Class and have retained counsel who are \ncompetent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action litigation \nand/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n19.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nhave no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class or Strip \nSearch Class. \nParties \n20.  Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was currently being held past his Release \nDate at the DC Jail as of the filing of this action and was strip searched without \nreasonable suspicion after being ordered to be released from custody. \n21.  Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins was currently being held past his Release \nDate at the DC Jail as of the filing of this action. \n22.  Plaintiff David Peterson was currently being held past his Release \nDate at the DC Jail as of the filing of this action and was strip searched without \nreasonable suspicion after being ordered to be released from custody. \n23.  Plaintiff Maurice Williams was currently held in the DC Jail as of the \nfiling of this action on a detention order in a traffic case that had been vacated on \n \n  10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 11 of 29(cid:10)\n2/8/06.  He was scheduled for a hearing on a show cause order for a probation \nviolation on a misdemeanor case issued by a District of Columbia Superior Court \nJudge after which he was likely to be further overdetained and subjected to an \nillegal court return strip search. \n24.  Plaintiff Toney James Malloy is an inmate in the custody of the \nDepartment of Corrections who as of the time of the filing of the first amended \ncomplaint was being held in the District of Columbia Superior Court lock up for \nreturn to the DC Jail or the holding facility at DC General after being sentenced to \nprobation with no confinement with no other charges on which he was being held, \nand at that time had no warrants, detainers or other basis for detention. \n25.  The District Government of the District of Columbia (hereinafter the \nDistrict of Columbia or the District) is a municipal corporation capable of being \nsued under D.C. Code § 1-102. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nComponents of the Department of Corrections \n26.  The District of Columbia Department of Corrections holds prisoners \ncommitted by the District of Columbia Superior Court, the District of Columbia \nDistrict Court, and other agencies, in the Central Detention Facility (“DC Jail”), \n \n  11\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 12 of 29(cid:10)\nthe Correctional Treatment Facility (\"CTF\") and at various halfway houses located \nin the District of Columbia. \n27.  Most prisoners held in the custody of the Department of Corrections \nare either pre-trial detainees, misdemeanants serving sentences, or parole and \nprobation violators.  \nThe Inmate Management System \n28.  The records office located at the DC Jail (\"Records Office\") is \nresponsible for administering and maintaining the records, including the judgment \nand commitment files, of all persons housed at the DC Jail, CTF and the halfway \nhouses. \n29.  The Records Office is responsible for ensuring that all persons housed \nat the DC Jail, CTF and the halfway houses are released according to their Release \nDates specified in their court orders. \n30.  The District of Columbia Superior Court enforces a policy pursuant to \nwhich an in-custody-defendant or a defendant ordered into custody may not leave \nthe courtroom without an order (commitment order or release order) for each case \non which he appeared. \n \n  12\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 13 of 29(cid:10)\nThe Overdetention Problem \n31.  \"Overdetain\" means holding a detainee or prisoner in Department of \nCorrections' custody past the person’s release date. \n32.  “Release Date” for each detainee or inmate is the day on which the \nperson is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for \nhis or her detention has otherwise expired. \n33.  “Exit Date” for each detainee or inmate is the day on which the person \nis actually released from the custody of the District of Columbia Department of \nCorrections. \n34.  The Department of Corrections had a long and documented history of \noverdetaining detainees and inmates past their release dates.   \n35.  The Department of Corrections, in response to a class action lawsuit, \ninstituted reforms that ameliorated and for periods eliminated the overdetention \nproblem. \n36.  However, in the last few weeks before the filing of this action, and, on \ninformation and belief, particularly since at least late December 2005, the \nDepartment of Corrections has again begun overdetaining large numbers of \ninmates. \n \n  13\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 14 of 29(cid:10)\n37.  The overdetention problem has been especially severe in the last few \nweeks before the filing of this action because of problems with the Department of \nCorrections’ computerized inmate population accounting system and for other \nreasons. \n \n  14\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 15 of 29(cid:10)\nThe Court Return Strip Search Problem \n38.  Prior to late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of Corrections \nfollowed a practice under which most inmates taken from custody of the \nDepartment of Corrections to court and ordered released by a judicial officer \nbecause the charge was no longer pending or because of a change in conditions of \nrelease was returned to the DC Jail or CTF for processing for release rather than \nbeing released from the courthouse. \n39.  In late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of Corrections instituted a \npolicy under which every inmates taken from custody of the Department of \nCorrections to court and ordered released by a judicial officer because the charge \nwas no longer pending or because of a change in conditions of release was returned \nto the DC Jail or CTF for processing for release rather than being released from the \ncourthouse. \n40.  In August 2005 the Department of Corrections instituted a policy of \ndiverting in-custody defendants ordered released or otherwise entitled to release \nfrom the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to a holding facility on the \ngrounds of DC General Hospital where they would not be subject to a strip search, \nabsent individualized suspicion, while the record review for detainers and warrants \nand property retrieval was conducted prior to release.  \n \n  15\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 16 of 29(cid:10)\n41.  However, in the last few weeks before the filing of this action, and, on \ninformation and belief, particularly since late December 2005, the Department of \nCorrections has been returning some in-custody defendants entitled to release from \nthe courthouses to the DC Jail or CTF and subjecting them to strip searches after a \njudge has ordered their release without a finding of individual reasonable \nsuspicion.  \n42.  The exact cause of the recent overdetentions and illegal court return \nstrip searches is not known, but the causes, on information and belief, include \nrecurring problems with the DC Jail’s computerized inmate population accounting \nsystem and the deliberate indifference of the acting warden Patricia Britton and the \nacting director Elwood York and the resignation of competent managers from the \nRecords Office and the failure to replace them. \n43.  Records Room staff have communicated the overdetention problem to \ntheir superiors by e-mail and by other written and oral communications to their \nsuperiors. \n44.  Their superiors are disregarding the problem and acquiescing in the \ncurrent overdetention and strip search problem. \n \n  16\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 17 of 29(cid:10)\nCarl A. Barnes’ Overdetention by the DC Jail \n45.  On or about 11/17/06 Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was committed to the \nDC Jail.  \n46.  Plaintiff Barnes’ Release Date was 2/15/06. \n47.  Plaintiff Barnes was currently being overdetained in the DC Jail as of \nthe filing of this action. \n48.  Plaintiff Barnes has suffered damages as a result of the over detention. \nDernard Hawkins’ Overdetention by the DC Jail \n49.  On or about 2/15/06 Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins was committed to the \nDC Jail.  \n50.  Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins’ Release Date was on or about 2/16/06. \n51.  Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins was currently being overdetained at the DC \nJail as of the filing of this action. \n52.  Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins has suffered damages as a result of the \noverdetention. \nPlaintiff David Peterson’s Overdetention by the DC Jail \n53.  On or about 2/13/06 Plaintiff David Peterson was committed to the \nDC Jail. \n54.  Plaintiff Peterson's Release Date was 2/20/06. \n \n  17\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 18 of 29(cid:10)\n55.  But Plaintiff David Peterson was not released on 2/20/06 even though \nthe Department of Corrections lacked a basis to continue detaining him. \n56.  Plaintiff Peterson's was currently being overdetained in the DC Jail as \nof the filing of this action. \n57.  Plaintiff Peterson has suffered damages as a result of the \noverdetention. \nPlaintiff Carl A. Barnes’s Strip Search \n58.  On 2/15/06 Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was taken to the Superior Court \nand the Superior Court judge sentenced him to time served. \n59.  Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was entitled to release on 2/15/05. \n60.  But, instead of being released or diverted to the holding facility at DC \nGeneral on 2/15/06, Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was returned to the DC Jail’s general \npopulation and subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity search without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons even though a court had ordered his release. \n61.  Plaintiff Barnes has suffered damages as a result. \nPlaintiff David Peterson’s Strip Search \n62.  On 2/21/06 Plaintiff David Peterson was again taken to the Superior \nCourt and the Superior Court judge ordered his immediate release. \n \n  18\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 19 of 29(cid:10)\n63.  On 2/21/06 Plaintiff David Peterson was diverted to the holding \nfacility at DC General because the judge in his case had previously ordered that he \nbe released on 2/20/06 and again on 2/21/06 ordered his release.  \n64.   Plaintiff David Peterson was entitled to release on 2/20/05. \n65.  But, instead of being released from the holding facility at DC General \non 2/21/06, Plaintiff David Peterson was returned to the DC Jail’s general \npopulation and subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity search without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons even though a court had ordered his release. \n66.  Plaintiff Peterson has suffered damages as a result. \nPlaintiff Maurice Williams \n67.  Plaintiff Maurice Williams at the time the First Amended Complaint \nwas filed (2/24/06) was held in the DC Jail on a traffic hold that had been vacated \n2/8/06.  He was the subject of a show cause order for probation violation in a \nmisdemeanor case issued by a District of Columbia Superior Court (but he was not \nsubject to a hold in the misdemeanor probation case and the Records Office did not \nshow him as being held in the misdemeanor probation case), and he had a hearing \nscheduled for 2/27/06 in the misdemeanor probation case, after which he was \nlikely to be overdetained and subjected to an illegal court return strip search.  The \n \n  19\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 20 of 29(cid:10)\njudge in the misdemeanor probation case issued a release order at the 2/27/06 \nhearing (even though there was no hold in that case) but the DC Jail continued to \nhold him on the traffic case (even though the traffic hold had been vacated 2/8/06) \nuntil 3/1/06 even though the Superior Court records showed that the traffic hold \nhad been discharged on 2/8/06.  Pursuant to the custom of overdetentions and the \npolicy of strip searches Mr. Williams was overdetained for 23 days and subjected \nto an illegal strip search after judges had ordered his release. \nPlaintiff Toney James Malloy \n68.  Plaintiff Toney James Malloy is an inmate in the custody of the Department \nof Corrections who as of the time of the filing of this amended complaint is being \nheld in the District of Columbia Superior Court lock up after being sentenced to \nprobation with no confinement with no other charges on which he is being held, no \nwarrants, detainers or other basis for detention. \n69.  Pursuant to the policy of the District of Columbia Department of \nCorrections, Plaintiff Toney James Malloy, instead of being released from the \nDistrict of Columbia Superior Court courthouse, will be returned to a Department \nof Corrections facility for out-processing. \n70.  Pursuant to a recent practice and custom of the District of Columbia \nDepartment of Corrections known to policymakers, Plaintiff Toney James Malloy \n \n  20\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 21 of 29(cid:10)\nwill be subjected to a suspicionless strip search and overdetained before being \nreleased.  \nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nCount 1 \n§ 1983 Deliberate Indifference Liability of the District for the Constitutional \nViolations of its Employees \n71.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nreallege and incorporate by reference all allegations set forth in the preceding \nparagraphs of this Complaint. \n72.  District of Columbia administrators, policy makers, supervisors and \nemployees caused the intentional, unjustified overdetention of the Overdetained \nNamed Plaintiffs and unreasonable strip searches of the Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members and Strip Search Class members by \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional injury of overdetention in \nadministering records relating to inmates’ detention and release, and maintaining \nand acquiescing in a policy and practice of strip searching certain inmates. \n73.  Overdetaining any person violates that person’s Fourth and Fifth and \nEighth Amendment rights. \n \n  21\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 22 of 29(cid:10)\n74.  Unreasonably strip searching an inmate violates his Fourth and Fifth \nAmendment rights. \n75.  District of Columbia employees continue in such conduct up to and \nincluding the present. \n76.  At all relevant times such District of Columbia employees were acting \nwithin the scope of their employment, their acts were motivated by a desire to \nfurther the interests of the District of Columbia, and such District of Columbia \nemployees were acting in furtherance of the business of the District of Columbia. \n77.  The District is therefore liable by virtue of its deliberate indifference \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for constitutional injuries to the Overdetained Named \nPlaintiffs and Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class members and Strip \nSearch Class members caused by the conduct of such employees. \n78.  Accordingly, all Named Plaintiffs and class members are entitled to \ndamages to be determined at trial, and the Overdetention and Strip Search Classes \nare entitled to injunctive relief. \n \n  22\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 23 of 29(cid:10)\nCount 2  \n§ 1983 Monell Custom and Practice Direct Liability of District of Columbia for \nViolation of Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendment Rights of Overdetained Named \nPlaintiffs and Class Members \n79.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth in this Complaint. \n80.  Beginning approximately in late December 2005, the District of \nColumbia, and its agents and employees, have had a custom of detaining people \npast their release dates, thereby causing the intentional, unjustified overdetention \nof the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and all other class members. \n81.  The District's actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly \nand proximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of \nthe Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and all other class members’ Fourth, Fifth and \nEighth Amendment rights. \n82.  Accordingly, all Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and Overdetention \nClass members are entitled to damages to be determined at trial, and the \nOverdetention Class is entitled to injunctive relief. \nCount 3 \n \n  23\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL     Document 6     Filed 05/24/2006     Page 24 of 29(cid:10)\n§ 1983 Monell Custom and Practice Direct Liability of District of Columbia for \nViolation of Fourth and Fifth Amendment Rights of Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nand Strip Search Class Members for Illegal Strip Searches \n83.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth in this Complaint. \n84.  The District's actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly \nand proximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of \nthe Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and the Strip Search Class members’ Fourth and \nFifth Amendment rights.   \n85.

Having carefully considered the \nMotions, the Oppositions, the Replies, oral argument of counsel, the entire record in this case, \nand the applicable law, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment,  and grant in part and deny in part Defendant’s  Motion for Summary \n                                                           \n1 Subsequent to plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike, Pls.’ Mot. Strike [271], Apr. 27, 2011, the District filed a Notice of \nWithdrawal of Defendant’s Notice Regarding Correction in Defendant’s Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of \nMaterial Facts Not in Dispute, Document Number 228-7 and Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike.  Def.’s \nNotice [294], May 23, 2011.  Since the District has voluntarily withdrawn the notice that plaintiffs have requested be \nstruck, the Court will deny plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike as moot. \n2 While not a motion requiring a ruling from this Court, the Court will briefly address plaintiffs’ comments in the \nNotice at the end of this opinion. \n\nJudgment.  The Court will also deny both of plaintiffs’ motions to strike.  A review of the \nbackground of the case, the governing law, the parties’ arguments, and the Court’s reasoning in \nresolving those arguments follows. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThis case involves overdetentions and strip searches at the District of Columbia’s jails.  \nThe District’s Department of Corrections has custody over thousands of prisoners serving time \nfor various offenses, with jail sentences of varying lengths.  To maintain security within its jails, \nthe DOC strip searches inmates upon admission or commitment to its jail facilities.  D.’s SMF \n[211-1] ¶ 3.  Each day the DOC shuttles some of its inmates to courts in the District so they can \nbe present at court appearances.  At some of those court appearances inmates receive court \norders from judges for their release from the DOC’s custody.  At that point the DOC begins an \nadministrative  release  process  that  results  in  the  prisoner’s  actual  release  from  the  DOC’s \ncustody.  The same release process is begun upon the expiration of an inmate’s prison sentence. \n  While there is no set definition for an “overdetention,” it generally means that once a \nprisoner was entitled to release -- because of a court order, the expiration of a sentence, or \notherwise -- the authority having custody over that person held them too long.  This case \ninvolves a group of plaintiffs representing a class of prisoners who allege, in essence, that the \nDOC held them too long after they were ordered released by a court or their sentences expired.  \nIn addition, since inmates with release orders from courts in the District were often returned to \nthe DOC’s jails while the administrative processing of their releases was undertaken by DOC \nstaff, those inmates were strip searched again pursuant to the DOC’s policy.  Therefore the \noverdetention problem and the strip search problem are interrelated, the one leading to the other. \n2 \n \n\nSince this case involves the DOC’s release process and whether it leads to overdetentions \nor is administered so poorly as to achieve the same result, the Court will first summarize that \nprocess.  A 2008 report commissioned by the District’s Criminal Justice Coordinating Council \nsupplies a helpful breakdown of the flow of paperwork between the various entities involved in \nthe release of DOC inmates and a description of the steps taken by the DOC’s Records Office to \nprocess releases.  Pls.’ Ex. 408 (“Schneider Report”).   \nThe Schneider Report notes that when a release order issues in a courtroom, “it travels \nthrough seven hands . . . before reaching the DC Jail Records office where it is processed.”  Id. at \n1.  Judges sign two original copies of release orders.  Id. at 4.  One copy is retained by the \ncourtroom clerk and scanned sometime that day into a docket management program used by the \nSuperior Court called “Court View.”  Id. at 4–5.  The other signed copy of the release order is \ngiven to the staff of the “Jail Board” at the courthouse, which holds onto all the inmates’ \npaperwork and coordinates with the DOC transportation staff to arrange the van or bus transport \nof inmates and their paperwork to the appropriate places.  Id. at 5. \nOnce an inmate’s paperwork has arrived at the DC Jail, it is brought to the Receiving and \nDischarge office, where jail records staff enter each order into a logbook, post each order in the \nDOC’s inmate-management program JACCS, and then send the orders via dumbwaiter to the DC \nJail’s Records Office for release processing.  Id. at 6. \nRecords Office staff -- unfortunately named “Legal Instrument Examiners” (“LIEs”) -- \nthen perform the final round of administrative steps that the DOC requires before releasing \ninmates.  Id.  A LIE first reviews the inmate’s actual file or “jacket” and confirms that the release \norders match the inmate’s cases.  Id.  The DOC will not release an inmate unless it has an actual, \nsigned copy of the release order.  The LIE also looks for other pending cases or detainers in the \n3 \n \n\nfile.  Id.  Next, the LIE checks the DOC’s own databases program, JACCS, to make sure that the \nJACCS data records coincide with the information in the physical file.  Id.  The LIE then checks \nother computer databases to see if there are any warrants out for the inmate’s arrest, and checks \nthe Superior Court’s database, Court View, to check for any other cases requiring that the inmate \nbe held in custody.  Id.  Once this first LIE determines that the inmate is eligible for release, a \nsecond, “senior” LIE performs all of the same steps -- again reviewing the inmate’s physical file  \n-- and then signs off on the inmate’s release.  Id.  The process takes from 2 to 2.5 hours to \ncomplete.  Simmons Dep. [228-2] 164:15–22. \nThat  the  DOC’s  release  procedures,  its  implementation  of  them,  or  both,  might  be \ngenerating unacceptable numbers of overdetentions is something that the District has been aware \nof for years.  This case is nearly identical to a prior case before this Court, Bynum v. District of \nColumbia, Civil Action No. 02-956 (RCL).  Bynum, filed in 2002, involved a class of about \n4,000 former DOC prisoners who claimed they’d been detained by the DOC past the point when \ntheir releases had been ordered, “for periods ranging from an extra day to many days or even \nmonths on end.”  Barnes v. District of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. 113, 115 ( D.D.C.  2007).  In \naddition to this “overdetention” class, this Court in Bynum certified an overlapping “strip search” \nclass.  The District moved for summary judgment, the Court denied that motion, and shortly \nthereafter the parties settled the case.   \nThe class members in Bynum were unable to get through the DOC’s release process on \nthe day that their releases were ordered, were held by the DOC past midnight, and overdetained.  \nIn addition, because -- as stated above -- the DOC’s policy is to strip search anyone who is \nreturned to the general jail population, Def.’s SMF [211-1] ¶ 3, many of the Bynum class \nmembers were strip searched, in some cases multiple times.  \n4 \n \n\nThe Bynum litigation ended on January 25, 2006 pursuant to a settlement agreement that \ncontained a number of components that were designed to remedy the overdetention and related \nstrip search problems at the District’s jails.3  Bynum, 412 F. Supp. 2d 73 (D.D.C. 2006).  Of the \n$12 million settlement amount agreed to by the parties in Bynum, $3 million was set aside “to \nbuild a state of the art Inmate Processing Center (IPC) within the foot print of the DC Jail site, \nwhich will be a project totaling $5 Million.”  Id. at 83.  The remaining $2 million was to be \nprovided by the District government.  Id.  The purpose of the IPC was to create adequate \nprocessing facilities for both intake and release of inmates and for the processing of associated \nrecords.  Id.  Among the reforms associated with the IPC was the requirement that “[c]ourt \nordered releases [would] be separated from inmates to be held in custody.”  Id.  This Court \nrecognized that the settlement promised “significant policy changes in the operation of the \nDepartment of Corrections,” and noted that the DOC’s “policy of strip searching court returnees \nsubject to release has been stopped as a direct result of this litigation.”  Id. at 85. \nHowever, in the aftermath of Bynum, instead of a swift change to the status quo at the \nDOC, there were years where little if any substantive change was instituted.  In fact, there isn’t \nmuch in the record indicating any significant reforms for well over a year after the close of the \nBynum class period.  With the exception of a DOC staff “tour” of “mega jail” facilities in \nOctober and November 2006, whose relationship to improving the DOC’s release process is \nentirely unclear from the record, the DOC appears to have done nothing concrete in response to \nthe overdetention problems at its jails until 2007.4   \n                                                           \n3 The Bynum overdetention monetary relief class period closed on August 31, 2005, the day before the start of the \noverdetention class period in the instant case.  See Bynum, 412 F. Supp. 2d at 78. \n4 The District says that the DOC has increased the number of staff in the Records Office “substantially” since 2006, \nDef.’s Mem. [211] 17, but it hasn’t indicated when that staffing increase began or how many of those additional \nemployees are Legal Instrument Examiners who might impact the release process.  Also, one senior Records Office \nemployee testified in 2010 that the Records Office has never been adequately staffed.  Simmons Dep. [216-7] \n277:15–20. \n5 \n \n\nThe Inmate Processing Center, mandated by the Bynum settlement, remains to this very \nday unbuilt.  According to the Interim Director of the DOC, the IPC has been “in the planning \nstages for several years.”  Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. [228] Ex. 1 at ¶ 17.  As of \nMarch 2010, the District had spent only $788,222 on the project, which now has an estimated \ncost of $15 million, rather than the $5 million specified in the Bynum settlement agreement.    \nThe District hasn’t provided an explanation for the extended delay in the IPC project or its \ncurrently trebled price tag, although it appears that these may in part be due to the DOC’s \ndecision to fold the IPC project into a number of others.  Pls.’ Second Mot. Compel [130], July \n28, 2010, Attachment 1 at 57–58.  The District’s most recent hope is to begin construction of the \nIPC in January 2012, with a completion date of July 2013.  Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. \nSumm. J. [228] Ex. 1 at ¶ 18.  However, since the District has pushed back the completion date \nrepeatedly, there’s reason to doubt whether this facility will be up and running at that time. \nAs  to  the  DOC’s  practice  of  strip-searching  court  returns  entitled  to  release  absent \nindividualized suspicion, the DOC agreed in 2005, as part of the Bynum settlement negotiations, \nto send court returns who had received release orders not to the DC Jail -- where they would be \nreturned to the general jail population and subjected to blanket strip searches -- but to a holding \nfacility at the DC General Hospital called the Medical Holding Unit.  Pls.’ Ex. 759 [214-12] 9:9–\n18.  The administrative processing of those inmates’ releases could take place while they were \nhoused at the MHU, and they could be released from that facility, without a strip search.  Id.  \nHowever, since that facility has nowhere for inmates to sleep in the event that their releases are \ndelayed, Def.’s Ex. 1 at ¶ 39, such inmates have been returned to the Jail or Correctional \nTreatment Facility and subjected to blanket strip searches.  Def.’s Resp. Pls.’ SMF [228-7] ¶ \n509.  So the persistence of the overdetention problems has led, it seems, to the continuing \n6 \n \n\nsubjection of court releases entitled to release to blanket strip searches, despite the promises of \nthe Bynum settlement. \nThe DOC’s lack of action in the wake of Bynum combined with singularly unhelpful \naction by the DC Council to exacerbate the overdetention problem.  In 2003, with the Bynum \nlitigation pending in this Court, the Council passed an ordinance prohibiting the release of \ninmates between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. under any circumstances, also known as the “10 \np.m. cut-off” rule. D.C. Code § 24-211.2(b)(6).5  This ordinance was allegedly adopted in the \nbest interests of inmates, to prevent “[r]eleasing inmates at midnight out the back door of the jail, \ninto a neighborhood where there is no transportation and no other facilities to assist inmates . . . \n.”  Pls.’ Ex. 207.  However, whatever its intended purpose, the ordinance’s effect was to turn \ndelayed releases into automatic, overnight overdetentions in cases where the Records Office was \nunable to complete the release process by 10 p.m.  The District’s own Attorney General notified \nthe DC Council’s Chairman in February 2009 that inmates were being overdetained “solely by \noperation of the cutoff provision” and that the provision was “unconstitutional as applied.”  Pls.’ \nEx. 206 [214-3]. \nHowever, the Record does indicate that beginning in 2007 --  more than a year after the \ninstant case was filed -- the DOC and the District began to take some steps to address the \noverdetention problem.  In July 2007, the DOC instituted a “new training regime” for LIEs that \nspans  “several  months,”  including  44 hou rs  of  “Records  Office  Overview  Training”  that \n“focuse[s] on the release process.”  Def.’s Mem. [211] 16; Def.’s Ex. 1 at ¶ 9, 10.  Also in 2007, \nthe DOC began -- for the first time -- to track overdetentions at its jails using “discrepancy \n                                                           \n5 At the time that the rule became effective in January 2004, it contained no exceptions for exigent circumstances.  \nHowever, the rule was modified by the “Safe Release of Inmates Amendment Act of 2010,” enacted in April 2010, \nto permit release after 10 p.m. in exigent circumstances, so long as the DOC takes steps to assure that the inmate has \nappropriate clothing, a place to sleep, and transportation from the jail. \n7 \n \n\nreports,”  providing  the  DOC  with  the  means  to  both  monitor  and  remedy  overdetention \nproblems.   \nPerhaps the single most significant reform occurred on July 7, 2008, when the DOC \ninstituted a “courthouse release” program, which permits inmates charged with misdemeanors to \nbe released directly from the Superior Court, instead of transporting them back to the DC Jail or \nCorrectional Treatment Facility for release processing.  Pls.’ Ex. 211 at 77; Def.’s Ex. 1 at ¶ 32.  \nPlaintiffs have “concede[d]” that the District’s courthouse release program “solved a lot of the \nproblems causing over-detentions and post release strip searches.”  Pls.’ Opp’n Def.’s Mot. \nSumm. J. [229] 30.  Plaintiffs’ counsel repeated at the June 2011 hearing on the parties’ motions \nfor summary judgment that this change was significant, and that the number of overdetentions -- \neven according to plaintiffs’ own numbers -- have trickled off since then. \nA number of less significant, but noteworthy, reforms occurred between 2008 and 2010, \nincluding the centralization of the release process for the District’s inmates in the Records \nOffice, the improvement of particular forms used by the DOC in the release process, and the \ninstitution of weekly audits of inmate-management data by the Records Office’s administrator. \nIt is not surprising, given this absence of activity for well over a year followed by a \ngradual introduction of reforms in subsequent years of the class period, that the evidence shows a \nhigh number of overdetentions in the early part of the class period followed by a decline in the \noverdetention numbers in subsequent years.   \nPlaintiffs’ numbers indicate thousands of overdetentions, particularly in the early years of \nthe class period.  Pls.’ Mem. [217-1] 3.  Plaintiffs estimate that during the first year of the class \nperiod there were 3,092 overdetentions, and that another 1,902 occurred from September 2006 to \nFebruary 2008.   Pls.’ Ex. 192 [213-15] ¶ 17.  These estimates are based upon an analysis \n8 \n \n\nperformed by plaintiffs’ statistical expert.  See Pls.’ Exs. 190, 192.  His analysis took as its \nstarting point a collection of data records from the DOC’s inmate-management program called \nthe Jail and Community Corrections System, or “JACCS.”  Pls.’ Ex. 190 ¶ 34.  Using this \nJACCS data, plaintiffs’ expert generated an over-inclusive list of persons who were potentially \noverdetained during certain periods.  Id. at ¶ 53.  Then, a statistical method called “stratified \nrandom sampling” was used to estimate the number of overdetentions and overdetention hours \nduring these periods.  Id. at ¶ 58.  In short, instead of physically inspecting every one of the \nmany thousands of inmate files on the potential overdetentions list to confirm whether or not \nthey were actual overdetentions, plaintiffs divided the list into groups, physically examined a \nrandom sample of files in each group, and then used those results to project an estimate of \noverdetentions across the whole population.  Id.  Plaintiffs do not have overdetention numbers \nmore current than February 25, 2008.6 \nThe District has no numbers at all that this Court can credit for the first 16 months of the \nclass period.  To account for the first year of the class period, the District provided a DOC \nreport7 titled “Analysis of Releases between September 1, 2005 a nd August 31, 2006” which \nindicates that 444 “late releases” occurred.  Def.’s Notice [244], Mar. 23, 2011, Attachment 1.  \nWhile 444 is a lot of overdetentions in a year, it is significantly less than the 3,092 indicated by \nplaintiffs’ evidence for that same period.  However, the District’s number is inscrutable because \nit cannot locate an attachment to that DOC report which contained the definition of “late release” \nused by the DOC to arrive at the report’s findings.  Without that definition, it is impossible to \n                                                           \n6 Plaintiffs’ overdetention figures cover only the period September 1, 2005 to February 25, 2008.  Pls.’ Ex. 192 at B-\n1. \n7 This report is the subject of Plaintiffs’ Non-Consent Motion [292] to Strike “Defendant’s Notice Regarding Filing \nAnalysis of Late Releases, Document Number 244.”  Pls.’ Notice [292], May 14, 2011.  For the reasons presented \nbelow, plaintiffs’ Motion is denied and the Court will consider this evidence. \n9 \n \n\ndetermine whether what the DOC is calling a “late release” is consistent with the overdetention \nclass definition or with plaintiffs’ overdetention definition. \nAs already noted, the DOC didn’t begin tracking overdetentions in a systematic way until \nJanuary  2007  --  about  16  months  into  the  class  period.    Def.’s  Mem.  [211]  25.   DOC  \n“discrepancy reports” provided to the Court by the District following the June 2011 hearing on \nthe parties’ motions for summary judgment, which list individual overdetentions by month and \nnote the reasons, show 302 overdetentions in 2007, 143 in 2008, 56 in 2009, 85 in 2010, and 22 \nin 2011 through the end of May.  Def.’s Notice [302], Jun. 9, 2011.  In contrast to the DOC’s \n“Analysis  of  Releases”  report  discussed  above,  the  District  did  provide  the  definition  of \n“overdetention”  used  to  create  these  DOC  discrepancy  reports.   T he  DOC  listed  as  an \noverdetention  “anyone  released  after  11:59  p.m.  on t he  day  they  are  ordered  released,  or \nalternatively,  situations  where  the  end  of  sentence  calculation  was  computed  incorrectly.”  \nSouverain Decl. [301-2] ¶ 3.  Clearly the District’s numbers for the period January 2007 forward \nshow a significant drop in the number of overdetentions in recent years. \nOverdetentions appear to be occurring for a variety of reasons.  The District suggests that \nhuman errors, the cause of many overdetentions, are inevitable in any complex system such as \nthe DOC.  The District emphasizes that four separate entities can authorize the release of an \ninmate from DOC custody, including the Superior Court, the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia, the U.S. Parole Commission, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Def.’s SMF [211-\n1]  ¶ 4 .  The DOC processes between 15,000 and 17,000 releases each year -- an average of \nbetween 41 and 47 each day.  Id. at ¶ 2.   \nAs to specific reasons for particular overdetentions, some are caused by mistakes by the \nDOC calculating inmates’ jail sentences.  Plaintiffs, summarizing a series of DOC reports, note \n10 \n \n\nthat  at  least  79  overdetentions  occurred  during  the  class  period  because  of  sentence \nmiscalculations.  Pls.’ Ex. 902 ¶ 4.  In ten of those cases misfiled or lost paperwork played a role.  \nId.  At least 75 overdetentions resulted from a failure to calculate inmates’ sentences in a timely \nfashion, such that the release process could not be completed before the District’s 10 p.m. cut-\noff, resulting in overdetentions.  Id. at ¶ 5.  The District claims that some overdetentions were \ncaused by factors “outside the control of the District,” including the failure of a federal authority, \nsuch as the Bureau of Prisons, to calculate an inmate’s sentence correctly.  Def.’s Mem. [211] \n27–28.   \nThe “10 p.m. cut-off” rule appears to have resulted in a large number of overdetentions, \nat least according to plaintiffs.  Analyzing and summarizing an “Audit Analysis”8 of thousands \nof potential overdetentions performed by the DOC during the first year of the class period, \nplaintiffs identified 1,244 overdetentions that the DOC itself said occurred because of the “10 \np.m. cut-off” rule.  Pls.’ Ex. 99B [221-9] ¶ 17.  This indicates that between 3 and 4 persons were \noverdetained  each  day  during  the  first  year  of  the  class  period  because  of  the  District’s \nordinance.  The District disputes plaintiffs’ “10 p.m. cutoff” number, citing its “Analysis of \nReleases” report as contrary evidence.  Def.’s Resp. Pls.’ SMF [228-7] ¶ 200.  But, as stated \nabove, that DOC report doesn’t contain the definition of “late release” used by the DOC, making \nthe District’s contrary numbers useless in terms of raising a genuine fact dispute. \nAt least 124 persons were overdetained due to a lack of staff or a large volume of releases \nto be processed on a particular day.  Pls.’ Ex. 99B [221-9] ¶ 30.  At least 151 persons were \noverdetained due to “late paperwork.”  Id. at ¶ 38.  Problems transferring inmates, along with \n                                                           \n8 The DOC’s “Audit Analysis” and “Analysis of Releases” are two separate documents.  The “Audit Analysis” is a \nspreadsheet containing thousands of potentially overdetained inmates, the reasons for their overdetentions, the \nduration of their overdetentions, as well as other data.  That “Audit Analysis” only contains records for releases in \nthe first year of the class period.  The “Analysis of Releases,” as explained above, is a report created by the DOC \npresenting the number of “late releases” during that same period. \n11 \n \n\ntheir paperwork, from the Correctional Treatment Facility to the DC Jail for release processing \nresulted in at least 68 overdetentions in the first year of the class period.  Id. at ¶ 56. \nThe named plaintiffs in this case -- Carl Barnes, Dernard Hawkins, Toney Malloy, David \nPeterson, and Maurice Williams -- are all former DOC inmates who claim that the DOC’s \noverdetention and strip-search problems remain widespread post-Bynum.9  Carl Barnes claims he \nwas ordered released, strip searched, and then overdetained for at least 7 days.  Pls.’ Ex. 5, \nBarnes Aff. 2.  Dernard Hawkins claims that he was entitled to release by a court order, but \nnevertheless was strip searched and overdetained for 7 days.  Pls.’ Ex. 18, Hawkins Aff. 2.  \nDavid Peterson claims that he was held for 4 days after the expiration of his sentence.  Pls.’ Ex. \n3, Peterson Aff. 1.  Maurice Williams claims he was ordered released, strip searched, and then \nheld for 21 days.  Pls.’ Ex. 4, Williams Aff. 2.  \nPlaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that their overdetentions violated \nthe Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments, while the strip searches violated the Fourth and Fifth \nAmendments.  Pls.’ Second Am. Compl. [12] ¶ 43, 44.  Early on in the litigation, the District \nfiled a Motion [14] to Dismiss, or, in the alternative, for Summary Judgment.  Def.’s Mot. \nDismiss [14], July 7, 2006.   The Court denied the District’s motion.10  Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at \n114. \nAt that same time, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify two classes.  The first is \nan “overdetention” class, defined as: \nEach person who has been, is, or in the future will be incarcerated in any District of \nColumbia Department of Corrections facility from September 1, 2005 forward; and who \n                                                           \n9 Another case before this Court, Simmons v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 07-493 (RCL), also claims that \noverdetention and strip-search problems continue at the DOC following the Bynum settlement.  This Court stayed \nSimmons’ claims relating to his overdetention pending further proceedings in the instant case.  Simmons v. District \nof Columbia,  750 F. Supp. 2d 43, 44 (D.D.C. 2011). \n10 Upon review, the Court takes notice of the fact that it intended to dismiss plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim, \nsince plaintiffs never alleged that their overdetentions were imposed as punishment.  Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at 118.  \nTherefore the Court will correct that error sue sponte by dismissing the claim in the Order issued today. \n12 \n \n\nwas not released, or, in the future, will not be released by midnight on the date on which \nthe person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for his \nor her detention has otherwise expired. \n \nId. at 120.  The second is a more complicated “strip search” class, defined as: \n  \nEach person who was, or in the future will be, from September 1, 2005 forward: (i) in the \ncustody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to court from a Department of \nCorrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to \nrelease by virtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had been held \nwas no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own \nrecognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was \notherwise entitled to release; (iv) was not the subject of any other pending cases or cases \nwhich imposed any condition of release other than personal recognizance; (v) was not the \nsubject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was returned from court to the DC Jail or CTF or \nother District facility, to be processed out of the Department of Corrections custody; and \n(vii)  was  subject  to  a  strip  search  and/or  visual  body  cavity  search  without  any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that was concealing \ncontraband  or  weapons;  before  being  released,  regardless  of  whether  he  was \noverdetained. \n \nId. at 121. \n \nThe Court later ordered that the case be bifurcated into liability and damages phases, with \ndamages discovery to be conducted at a later time upon a further order of the Court.  Order [65], \nAug. 31, 2009.  All liability phase discovery closed in January 2011.  Soon after the parties filed \nmotions for summary judgment. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  state  that  “[t]he  court  shall  grant  summary \njudgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986).  The standard requires more than the existence of some \nfactual dispute: “the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.”  Anderson, \n477 U.S. at 247–48 (1986) (emphasis in original).  A fact is a material fact if, under the \napplicable law, it could affect the outcome of the case.   Id.  A dispute is a genuine dispute for \n13 \n \n\nsummary judgment purposes if the “evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict \nfor the nonmoving party.”  Id.  Also, because “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the \nevidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of \na judge,” the “evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to \nbe drawn in his favor.”  Id. at 255. \nA nonmoving party, however, must establish more than “the existence of a scintilla of \nevidence” in support of its position.  Id. at 252.  In addition, the nonmoving party may not rely \nsolely on allegations or conclusory statements.  See Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. \nCir. 1999).  The nonmoving party must present specific facts that enable a reasonable jury to find \nin its favor.  Id.  If the evidence presented is “merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, \nsummary judgment may be granted.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249–50. \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  The Parties’ Motions for Summary Judgment \nBefore the Court are plaintiffs’ Motion [217] for Summary Judgment and defendant’s \nMotion [211] for Summary Judgment.  Plaintiffs, relying on expert analysis showing that the \nnumber of overdetentions have remained high throughout the class period, argue that the DOC \nand  the  District  have  continued  to  violate  prisoners’  constitutional  rights  post-Bynum,  and \nmaintain that on a record of broken promises and stubborn inaction by the District, a reasonable \njury could only find that the District has been deliberately indifferent to these issues, and is thus \nliable as a matter of law.  In response and in support of its own motion, the District points to the \nfalling  number  of  overdetentions,  the  lack  of  any  official  policies  that  could  cause \noverdetentions, and a number of reforms that have been enacted to argue that no reasonable jury \ncould find that they have been indifferent to these issues, and thus the case must be dismissed.  \n14 \n \n\nThe Court will discuss these and other arguments in the context of each of the four remaining \nclaims, which the Court shall address in turn.   \n1.  Fourth Amendment violations for overdetentions \nBefore examining whether the District is liable for any constitutional violations, plaintiffs \nmust first demonstrate the existence of such violations in the first place.  Collins v. City of \nHarker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 120 (1992).   \nPlaintiffs bring a Fourth Amendment challenge to their overdetentions.  The Fourth \nAmendment guarantees “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, \nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”  U.S. Const. amend. IV.  Although \nneither party raised this argument in its papers, as is clear from the plain text of the Fourth \nAmendment, plaintiffs must show that their overdetentions constituted seizures of their persons \nto make out a violation of that amendment.  See McCoy v. Harrison, 341 F.3d 600, 605 (7th Cir. \n2003).   \nA “seizure” triggering the Fourth  Amendment’s protections occurs when a person’s \nfreedom of movement is terminated or restrained, either by physical force or a show of authority.  \nBrendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249, 254 (2007).  However, plaintiffs were already in custody at \nthe time they were ordered released or their sentences expired.  Their freedom of movement had \nalready been terminated.  See  Goldhaber v. Higgins, 576 F. Supp. 2d 694, 718 (W.D. Pa. 2007); \nRatigan v. Trogvac, No. 4:CV-08-1667, 2009 WL 648931, at *29 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 11, 2009).  In \naddition, plaintiffs haven’t presented any facts suggesting that their overdetentions involved \nfresh “seizures” warranting a Fourth Amendment analysis.   \n15 \n \n\nFor these reasons, the Court will deny plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary judgment as to its \nclaim that the overdetentions violated the Fourth Amendment, and will grant the District’s \nMotion for Summary Judgment as to that claim. \n2.  Fifth Amendment violations for overdetentions \nPlaintiffs also bring a Fifth Amendment challenge to their overdetentions.  Plaintiffs \nargue that the DOC’s system for processing releases is outmoded, adding hours and often days to \nthe release process, and thereby violating plaintiffs’ due process right to a “prompt” release.  \nPls.’ Mem. [217-1] 1–2.  They claim that certain longstanding DOC practices, such as refusing to \nrelease an inmate until the Records Office receives the physical, signed court order, Def.’s Opp’n \nPls.’ SMF [228-7] ¶ 328, and operation of a “split” inmate management system where the DOC’s \nand Superior Court’s computers cannot share information electronically, invite overdetentions.  \nPls.’ Mem. [217] 15–16.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to impose a “bright line time limit” on the \nDOC’s release process, based upon evidence indicating that the DOC’s release process by itself \ntakes no longer than 2.5 hours to complete.  Id. at 15.   \nThe District focuses its argument on its contention that plaintiffs cannot show, as a matter \nof law, that the overdetentions were the result of either a municipal policy or practice or the \nDistrict’s deliberate indifference, and that therefore plaintiffs cannot show that the District is \nliable under the Supreme Court’s framework for Section 1983 municipal liability as laid out in \nMonell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  Def.’s Mem. [211] 10–11.  The District \nclaims that “proactive efforts” by the DOC post-Bynum have led to a dramatic reduction in the \nnumber of overdetentions, and that its very adoption of those practices “run[s] counter to any \nconceivable finding of deliberate indifference.”  Id. at 13.  To challenge plaintiffs’ contention \nthat  the  DOC’s  release  procedures  are  problematic,  the  District  offers  the  testimony  of  a \n16 \n \n\ncorrectional  expert,  who  opines  that  the  DOC’s  release  process  is  “effective  and  efficient, \nappropriately staffed, and indeed meets best practices.”  Def.’s Ex. 6 at 5. \na.  Legal standard \nThe Fifth Amendment states that “[n]o person . . . shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or \nproperty, without due process of law . . . . ”  U.S. Const. amend. V.  Ordinarily claims of due \nprocess violations by State officials are analyzed under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, which applies to the States.  Butera v. District of Columbia, 235 F.3d 637, 646 n.7 \n(D.C. Cir. 2001).  While the District of Columbia is not a state, it is subject to the almost \nidentical provisions of the Fifth Amendment.  Id. (citing Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 \n(1954)).   \nOverdetentions potentially violate the substantive11 component of the Due Process Clause \nby infringing upon an individual’s basic liberty interest in being free from incarceration absent a \ncriminal conviction.  See Oviatt, 954 F.2d at 1474.  This liberty interest is deeply rooted:  \n“[f]reedom from bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due \nProcess Clause from arbitrary governmental action.”  Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 \n(1992).  Even if an inmate’s initial confinement was justified by a constitutionally adequate \nbasis, that confinement cannot constitutionally continue once that basis no longer exists.  See id. \nat 757. \n                                                           \n11 Plaintiffs have not indicated whether their overdetentions constitute violations of substantive or procedural due \nprocess.  The substantive component of the Due Process Clause bars governmental actions “regardless of the \nprocedures used to implement them.”  Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986).  Substantive due process \nclaims require a showing of governmental conduct that is “so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to \nshock the contemporary conscience.”  County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8 (1998); Cohen v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 744 F. Supp. 2d 236, 243 (D.D.C. 2010).  Under procedural due process, the government is \nrequired to provide individuals with certain procedural rights before it may deprive them of life, liberty, or property.  \nSee  Matthews  v.  Eldridge,  424  US.  319,  332–33  (1976).    Procedural  due  process  traditionally  protects  an \nindividual’s right to be heard “at a meaningful time and in meaningful manner.”  Id. at 333.  For these reasons, the \nCourt finds that the plaintiffs’ overdetention claims are properly analyzed as violations of the substantive component \nof the Due Process Clause.  See also Goldberg v. Hennepin County, 417 F.3d 808, 811 (8th Cir. 2005).   \n17 \n \n\nTemporarily retaining custody over an inmate who is entitled to release in order to \naccomplish administrative tasks incident to that release is not per se unconstitutional.  Lewis v. \nO’Grady, 853 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1988) (“We recognize that the administrative tasks \nincident to a release of a prisoner may require some time to accomplish -- in this case perhaps a \nnumber of hours.”).  However, courts recognize that inmates’ due process rights may be violated \nif they are not released within a reasonable time after the reasons for their detentions have ended.  \nBrass v. County of Los Angeles, 328 F.3d 1192, 1200 ( 9th Cir. 2003); Goldberg v. Hennepin \nCounty, 417 F.3d 808, 811 (8th Cir. 2005). \nCourts have declined to adopt a bright-line rule for the maximum permissible delay in the \noverdetention context.  Berry v. Baca, 379 F.3d 764, 771 (9th Cir. 2004).  This contrasts with the \nSupreme Court’s approach, in the Fourth Amendment context, to detentions pending probable \ncause determinations after warrantless arrests, where the Court adopted a 48-hour rule.  County \nof Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991).   \nIn McLaughlin, the Court recognized that States “have a strong interest in protecting \npublic safety by taking into custody those persons who are reasonably suspected of having \nengaged in criminal activity, even where there has been no opportunity for a prior judicial \ndetermination of probable cause.”  Id. at 53.  On the other hand, the consequences of prolonged \ndetention for the arrestee can be severe, potentially imperiling his or her job, source of income, \nand family relationships.  Id. \nIn the overdetention context, the potential consequences for overdetained inmates are \nsimilar, while the societal interests involved are very different.12  Here, there has already been a \njudicial determination that the inmate is entitled to freedom from imprisonment.  In the eyes of \n                                                           \n12 The District concedes that the “plight of a new arrestee . . . is not identical to an inmate at the end of a legitimate \nincarceration.”  Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. [228] 14. \n18 \n \n\nthe law, this person is no longer a prisoner.  Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles, 527 P.2d 865, \n868 (Cal. 1974).  As a result, the jail has every reason to believe that the person’s continued \ndetention is unlawful and no reason to believe that some other basis for the detention -- for \nexample, a warrant or detainer in a separate matter -- exists, other than the fact that this person is \nbeing held by a correctional institution and at one point was legitimately incarcerated.  While \nsociety has an interest in preventing the release of an inmate when an alternative basis for his \nconfinement exists, and in administrative tasks aimed at preventing such releases, these interests \nare simply not as weighty as the interests involved in the probable cause context, where the \nindividual  who  is  subjected  to  administrative  delays  is  personally  suspected  of  criminal \nactivity.13   \nFurthermore,  the  “administrative  burden  of  accelerating  the  release  process  --  in \nparticular, running a computer check on wants and holds within less than forty-eight hours -- \ndoes not seem as weighty as the burden of establishing probable cause under a tight timeline.”  \nBerry, 379 F.3d at 772.  This burden is even further reduced given that many, if not most, of the \nadministrative tasks incident to an inmate’s release can be undertaken prior to the expiration of a \nsentence or before a jail’s receipt of a paper court order authorizing release -- unlike in the \nprobable  cause  context,  where  all  of  the  administrative  tasks  must  necessarily  follow  the \ndetainee’s arrest.  \n                                                           \n13 The District argues that ensuring that inmates with release orders from a court, or whose sentences have expired, \nare not “erroneously released” because some other basis for their detention might exist is an “extremely important \nsocietal interest” because erroneous releases can have serious consequences.  Def.’s Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. \n[228] 13.  As support for this they cite a federal case concerning whether a parole board’s decision to deny a \nconvicted sex offender’s release on parole was constitutional.  Juarez v. Renico, 149 F. Supp. 2d 319, 321 (E.D. \nMich. 2001).  That case provides no support for the District’s contention, because it concerned whether to release a \nparticularly dangerous category of criminal before the expiration of a valid sentence, not whether to release from \nprison a person who is entitled, at that very moment, to release, and whom the DOC has absolutely no reason to \nsuspect is the subject of some other basis for continued detention. \n19 \n \n\nIn  recognition  of  these  facts,  courts  appear  to  agree  that  the  maximum  permissible \nadministrative delay in the overdetention context likely falls well short of the 48-hour horizon set \nout in McLaughlin.  Berry, 379 F.3d at 771–72; Brass v. County of Los Angeles, 328 F.3d 1192, \n1202 (9th Cir. 2003).  “[E]ven a thirty-minute detention after being ordered released could work \na violation of a prisoner’s constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.”  Davis v. \nHall, 375 F.3d 703, 713 (8th Cir. 2004).  The Eighth Circuit has held that once a judge orders the \nrelease of a prisoner, any continued detention unlawfully deprives the prisoner of his liberty \nbecause “the state has lost its lawful authority” to hold him.  Slone v. Herman, 983 F.2d 107, 110 \n(8th Cir. 1993). \nGiven that plaintiffs’ overdetention claims are brought under the substantive component \nof  the  Due  Process  Clause,  to  show  a  violation  of  their  constitutional  rights,  they  must \ndemonstrate that the DOC’s conduct either interferes with rights “implicit in the concept of \nordered liberty,” U.S. v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746 (1987), or was “so egregious, so outrageous, \nthat it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”  County of Sacramento v. \nLewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8 (1998); Cohen v. District of Columbia, 744 F. Supp. 2d 236, 243 \n(D.D.C. 2010).  In the prison setting, where forethought about the welfare of inmates “is not only \nfeasible  but  obligatory  under  a r egime  that  incapacitates  a  prisoner  to  exercise  ordinary \nresponsibility  for  his  own  welfare,”  “deliberate  indifference  can  rise  to  a  constitutionally \nshocking level . . . .”  Lewis, 523 U.S. at 851, 852.  The central question is whether the DOC’s \nconduct manifested deliberate indifference to plaintiffs’ and the class members’ constitutional \nrights.  See Goldberg v. Hennepin County, 417 F.3d 808, 811 (8th Cir. 2005).  Courts evaluating \ndue process claims involving overdetentions have found various factors relevant to the analysis, \nincluding the delays associated with necessary administrative procedures, the total number of \n20 \n \n\npersons overdetained during the period, the rate of overdetentions given the total number of \nreleases processed, and the duration of individual overdetentions.  See Goldberg, 417 F.3d at \n812; Berry v. Baca, 379 F.3d 764, 769 (9th Cir. 2004).   \ni.  Overdetentions caused by the DOC’s enforcement of the District’s “10 \np.m. cut-off” ordinance \n \nPlaintiffs argue that the due process rights of certain overdetained class members were \nviolated as a direct result of the District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” ordinance, calling the ordinance an \n“over-detention-making machine.”  Pls.’ Mem. [217-1] 47.   Plaintiffs have offered evidence \nshowing  that  during  just  the  first  year  of  the  class  period,  over  a  thousand  persons  were \noverdetained because of the DOC’s enforcement of that ordinance.  Pls.’ Ex. 99B at ¶ 17.  \nOverdetentions  resulting  from  enforcement  of  the  ordinance  occurred  throughout  the  class \nperiod, even according to the District’s evidence, Def.’s Notice [302], Jun. 9, 2011, until roughly \nMarch 2009, when the DOC ceased enforcement of it on the advice of the District’s Attorney \nGeneral.  Def.’s Ex. 1 at ¶ 43. \nThe District refers only once to the “10 p.m. cut-off” rule in its Memorandum, in the \ncontext of its discussion of the DOC’s strip search policy.  Def.’s Mem. [211] 32.  In its \nMemorandum in Opposition, the District argues that the ordinance’s requirement of mandatory \novernight detentions for inmates whose releases could not be processed by the DOC by 10 p.m. \nis “neither unusual nor unreasonable.”  Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. [228] 24.   \nThe District cites for this proposition Holder v. Town of Newton, No. 08-cv-197-JL, 2010 \nWL 432357 (D.N.H. Feb. 3, 2010), which concerned a challenge to the detention of a person \nwho was arrested late at night without a warrant.  Id. at *1.  Instead of being given an immediate \nbail hearing, Holder was held overnight at the county jail, which was located “in a rural area with \ndark roads and no taxi service at night.”  Id. at *2.  Holder, however, is clearly distinguishable \n21 \n \n\nfrom the facts of this case because not only did that detention involve an arrestee who was first \narrested late at night and who did not acquire a release order from a court that evening, but the \njail to which he was transported was a rural jail with no taxi service.  In addition, the court in \nHolder specifically noted that if Holder could prove that “the bail commissioner ordered his \nrelease on the night of his arrest, but . . . the county jail nevertheless continued to detain him \nuntil the next morning,” “he might be able to show a due process violation under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.”  Id. at *10.   \nIn  this  case,  unlike  Holder,  the  District’s  “10  p.m.  cut-off”  rule  operated  to  detain \novernight individuals who already possessed court orders for release.  Furthermore, given the \nurban location of the DC Jail and Correctional Treatment Facility -- each very short walks from \ntwo subway stations and with access to taxi service -- the Holder case provides no support for \nthe District’s contention that the “10 p.m. cut-off” rule is neither “unusual nor unreasonable.”  In \nfact, the District’s ordinance was both unusual and unreasonable to the extent that it categorically \nprohibited releases after 10 p.m.  The District has provided literally no examples of other urban \njails that apply such a policy with inmates entitled to release by court order or otherwise. \nNor has the District offered evidence suggesting that overdetentions caused by the DOC’s \nenforcement of the District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” rule were the result of necessary administrative \ntasks or other reasonable delays.  See Lewis v. O’Grady, 853 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1988) \n(accepting that delays in the release of inmates of some number of hours are permissible to \nperform administrative tasks).  Indeed, the “10 p.m. cut-off” rule categorically prohibited the \nrelease of a person with a court order entitling him to release, even if that release process was \ncompleted at 10:01 p.m.  While the District contends that the rule was for inmates’ benefit, \nDef.’s  Opp’n  Pls.’  Mot.  Summ.  J.  [228]  24,  the  District  could  have  --  and  has,  in  later \n22 \n \n\namendments to the ordinance14 -- promoted this interest in inmate welfare while simultaneously \nrespecting the entitlement of persons with court orders for release to a prompt release.  The \nDistrict’s interest in the welfare of former inmates, who must be released after 10 p.m. because \nof delays in the DOC’s release process, must not be permitted to completely overwhelm their \nbasic right to be free from incarceration when there exists no legal basis whatsoever for the \ncontinued deprivation of their liberty.  Once the basis for the person’s continued incarceration is \ngone, the District’s authority to simply continue holding them in prison -- even to promote the \nDistrict’s own sense of what’s good for them -- is gone as well.  The District’s legislative \nbehavior is truly irrational in that the District had just been sued, in this very Court, the year \nbefore it enacted a rule that mandates overdetentions when the DOC -- as was often the case -- \nhad failed to process inmates’ releases in a timely fashion.  The District’s legislative act is \ntherefore not only shocking to this Court, but has interfered with the fundamental liberty interests \nof class members overdetained on account of that ordinance. \nTherefore the Court concludes that the DOC’s enforcement of the District’s “10 p.m. cut-\noff” rule violated the due process rights of class members who were overdetained, during all \nparts of the class period, because of that rule. \nii.  Overdetentions from September 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006 \nThe Court will now consider whether the overdetentions that occurred during the first 16 \nmonths of the class period violated class members’ Fifth Amendment rights. \nLooking at the evidence, it is undisputed that the DOC’s release process should take from \n2 to 2.5 hours to complete.  Simmons Dep. [228-2] 164:15–22; Def.’s Response Pls.’s SMF \n                                                           \n14 Later amendments to the ordinance provide an exception for “exigent and unusual circumstances.”  D.C. Code § \n24-211.2(b)(7) (2011).  Releases past 10 p.m. require the DOC to verify that the inmate has a place to sleep that \nnight, appropriate clothing, any necessary medications, and transportation.  Id.  Also, the DOC must give the inmate \nthe “option of remaining within a [DOC] facility until release at 7 a.m.”  Id. at § 24-211.2(b)(7)(F). \n23 \n \n\n[228-7] ¶ 87.  Given the dozens of administrative steps involved in the DOC’s release process, \nthe Court does not find it surprising that the process should take that long.  However, according \nto plaintiffs, the DOC’s release process is both faulty and inefficiently implemented, frequently \nresulting in large numbers of overdetentions and significant delays beyond 2.5 hours.  \n  At least for the first 16 months of the class period, plaintiffs’ view is confirmed by the \nfacts.  In the case of the named plaintiffs, they show overdetentions ranging from 4 to 21 days.  \nThe District has not put forth any evidence disputing these individual overdetentions.  Nor do \nthey appear to be outliers.  Plaintiffs have put forth evidence that, for the first 16 months of the \nclass period, the DOC overdetained inmates in its custody on a routine basis and on an alarming \nscale.  From September 1, 2005 until August 31, 2006 -- the first year of the class period -- there \nwere  3,092  overdetentions.    Pls.’  Ex.  192 [ 213-15]  ¶  17.    Taking  the  District’s  numbers \nindicating that it processes between 15,000 and 17,000 releases each year, Def.’s SMF [211-1] ¶ \n2, the DOC was overdetaining about one out of every five inmates it processed for release.   \nDividing the number of overdetention hours found by the plaintiffs for that period (111,964) by \nthe number of overdetentions (3,092) shows that on average these overdetained individuals spent \nan extra 36 hours at the DC Jail -- more than 10 times longer than the release process is supposed \nto take.  As stated above, the District’s only evidence contradicting plaintiffs’ overdetention \nnumbers for this period -- a DOC report titled “Analysis of Releases” -- doesn’t raise a genuine \nissue of fact because that report fails to indicate what overdetention definition was used to create \nit.  As such it is a conclusory allegation that the plaintiffs’ numbers for the first year of the class \nperiod are wrong, and nothing more.  And the District has no overdetention figures at all for the \n4 months following August 31, 2006. \n24 \n \n\n  This roiling overdetention problem at the DOC during the first 16 months of the class \nperiod is all the more shocking when the Court considers that the DOC and the District were on \nnotice, via the Bynum litigation, that the prevailing release practices were deeply inadequate, and \nthat fundamental change was needed.  The Court would have expected, given that lawsuit, a \nconcerted effort on the part of the District and the DOC to identify and eliminate every major \ncontributing factor to the overdetention problem.  But that’s not what happened.  Even when the \nfacts are viewed in the light most favorable to the District, the DOC’s first meaningful change to \nthe status quo didn’t come until July 2008, when it instituted the courthouse release program, \npermitting a subset of inmates to be released directly from the Superior Court.15  Both parties \nagree that this was a significant step toward reducing the number and duration of overdetentions.  \nThe District’s only evidence of steps taken during the first 16 months of the class period -- an \naffidavit  from  former  DOC  Director  Devon  Brown,  stating  that  the  DOC  assumed  the \nresponsibility for inmate court-to-jail transportation from the US Marshals in 2005, Def.’s Ex. 1 \nat ¶ 33 -- cannot be credited because Mr. Brown lacks personal knowledge of events prior to his \nassuming that position in January 2006.  Id. at ¶ 2. \nOther major changes -- such as the completion of the Inmate Processing Center, a move \nto a paperless system to process releases rather than a dogged insistence on releasing inmates \nonly upon receipt of paper court orders, or simply permitting releases based upon faxed  (or, to \nbe even more futuristic, scanned and emailed) court orders -- were either rejected by the DOC or \n                                                           \n15 The DOC’s “courthouse release” program only applies to inmates charged with misdemeanors.  Def.’s Ex. 1 at ¶ \n32.  Inmates charged with felonies do not benefit from that program, and therefore presumably are no more likely \nthan before that program was instituted to be released on time by the DOC -- assuming other improvements to the \nrelease process haven’t occurred.  The District hasn’t pointed out to the Court the basis for this misdemeanor/felony \ndistinction, and this Court at least thinks there’s reason to question whether the District can legally subject one free \nindividual to an extended release procedure on account of their prior felony conviction, while allowing another free \nindividual a speedy release because they were charged only with a misdemeanor.  While the Court recognizes in this \nopinion that the courthouse release program has clear significance with respect to the question of the District’s \nSection 1983 liability for constitutional violations as some step taken to address the overdetention issue, the Court \ndoes not intend thereby to endorse the program’s distinction between former prisoners. \n25 \n \n\nremain, to this day, caught in a whirlpool of delays.  In the meantime, free men and women were \ntreated as prisoners, hoping the DOC’s paper-bound and Byzantine release process would favor \nthem with an on-time release.  \nThis Court’s alarm at the DOC’s lack of urgency in responding to this disturbing pattern \nof overdetentions despite the notice provided by the Bynum litigation is further enhanced by the \nfact that this case deals with prisoners, outcasts in society.  The full brunt of the harm for the \nDOC’s refusal to get its act together falls, not on District employees or influential citizens, but \nexclusively upon persons with little voice, who are shut away from public view.  It is for these \nreasons that the Court finds that the DOC’s treatment of inmates entitled to release during the \nfirst 16 months of the class period is not merely alarming, and deliberately indifferent, but \nconscience-shocking. \n  Therefore the Court finds that with respect to overdetentions during the first 16 months of \nthe class period -- September 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006 -- the DOC violated the due process \nrights of the plaintiffs and the members of the overdetention class who were overdetained during \nthat period by not releasing them by midnight on the day that they were entitled to release.  No \nreasonable juror could find otherwise. \niii. Overdetentions from January 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008 \n \nHowever, for the period January 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008, the Court finds that there \nexists a genuine issue of material fact as to the number of overdetentions, precluding a finding of \nsummary judgment for plaintiffs or the District as to that period.  The District has produced its \nown overdetention figures from January 2007 to the present, which, if taken as true, suggest that \nthe DOC has significantly reduced the number of overdetentions in the most recent years of the \nclass period.  See Def.’s Notice [302], Jun. 9, 2011.   A reasonable jury, if it believes the \n26 \n \n\nDistrict’s  numbers,  could  find  that  the  DOC  has  addressed  the  problems  resulting  in \noverdetentions on a routine basis.  On the other hand, if the jury believes plaintiff’s numbers, it \ncould reasonably conclude that the number of overdetentions during that period -- nearly 2,000 \nfor the period September 2006 to February 2008, Pls.’ Mem. [217-1] 3; Pls.’ Ex. 192 [213-15] ¶ \n17 -- indicate that the DOC was deliberately indifferent to the overdetention problem despite the \nDistrict’s proffer of steps taken during that period to address the overdetention problem.  In \nshort, these factual disputes preclude a finding of summary judgment for plaintiffs or for the \nDistrict as to due process violations for the overdetentions that occurred from January 1, 2007 to \nFebruary 25, 2008. \nTherefore the Court will deny plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to its claim \nthat overdetentions from January 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008 violate the Fifth Amendment, and \nwill deny the District’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to that same period. 16      \niv.  Overdetentions from February 26, 2008 to the present    \nPlaintiffs have produced no evidence indicating the number of overdetentions that have \noccurred after February 25, 2008.  See Pls.’ Ex. 192 [213-15] at B-1.  Therefore the Court must \nconsider as undisputed the District’s overdetention figures for the period February 26, 2008 to \nthe present.  These figures show only 121 overdetentions from March 2008 through the end of \nthe year, 56 during all of 2009, 85 in 2010, and 22 in 2011 through the end of May.  (D.’s Notice \n[302], Jun. 9, 2011).  The District’s overdetention figures for this period, taking into account the \nnumber of releases processed by the DOC each year (15,000–17,000), show an overdetention \nrate that has been found acceptable in other courts that have considered overdetention problems \n                                                           \n16 This ruling does not apply to overdetentions that occurred during this period because of the DOC’s enforcement \nof the District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” ordinance.  As to those overdetentions, plaintiffs have shown a predicate \nconstitutional violation, for the reasons stated above. \n27 \n \n\nat municipal jails.  See Mortimer v. Baca, 478 F. Supp. 2d 1171, 1179 (C.D. Cal. 2007), aff’d, \n594 F.3d 714 (9th Cir. 2010); Avalos v. Baca, 596 F.3d 583, 588 n.4 (9th Cir. 2010). \nThe significant reduction in the number of overdetentions as of February 2008, alongside \nthe District’s implementation in 2008 of measures that even plaintiffs concede have “solved” \nmuch of the overdetention problem, leads this Court to the conclusion that the DOC, from \nFebruary 2008 forward, could not reasonably be found to have been deliberately indifferent to \nthe due process rights of overdetention class members during this period.  No reasonable jury, \nconsidering these facts, could conclude that the DOC was aware of, but chose to do nothing \nabout, the overdetention problem during this period. \nTherefore the Court will deny plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to \noverdetentions that occurred from February 26, 2008 forward, and will grant defendants’ Motion \nfor Summary Judgment with respect to the same period.17   \nb.  The District’s liability \nTo summarize the above conclusions, the Court has determined, as a matter of law, that \nclass members whose overdetentions were caused by the DOC’s enforcement of the District’s \n“10 p.m. cut-off” rule have made out a violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Furthermore, the \nplaintiffs’ and class members’ due process rights were violated for the period September 1, 2005 \nto December 31, 2006.  The Court has found genuine issues of material fact precluding a finding \nof due process violations for overdetentions that occurred from January 1, 2007 to February 25, \n2008.  Finally, the Court has found, as a matter of law, that for the period February 26, 2008 to \nthe present, Plaintiffs have failed to show a predicate constitutional violation.  The Court will \nnow  consider  the  question  of  the  District’s  liability  for  the  remaining  periods:  the  period \n                                                           \n17 Again, this ruling does not apply to overdetentions that occurred during this period because of the DOC’s \nenforcement of the District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” ordinance.   \n28 \n \n\nSeptember 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006, and the period January 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008.  \nThe Court will also consider the District’s liability for due process violations that occurred \nthroughout the class period as a result of its “10 p.m. cut-off” rule. \nPlaintiffs’ overdetention and strip search claims are brought under Section 1983 of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1871, which creates liability for “[e]very person who, under color of any \nstatute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of \nColumbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person \nwithin the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured \nby the Constitution and laws.”  42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nLocal governing bodies, such as the District of the Columbia, can be sued under Section \n1983 when “the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy \nstatement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body’s \nofficers.”  Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978).  “[T]he touchstone of the § \n1983 action against a government body is an allegation that official policy is responsible for a \ndeprivation of rights protected by the Constitution.”  Id.  However, “local governments . . . may \nbe sued for constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental ‘custom’ even though \nsuch a custom has not received formal approval through the body’s official decisionmaking \nchannels.”  Id. \nThere are several different ways that a plaintiff can demonstrate that a city is liable via \nSection 1983.  The plaintiff can show (1)  “the explicit setting of a policy by the government that \nviolates the Constitution,” (2) “the action of a policy maker within the government,” (3) “the \nadoption through a knowing failure to act by a policy maker of actions by his subordinates that \nare so consistent that they have become ‘custom,’” or (4) “the failure of the government to \n29 \n \n\nrespond to a need . . . in such a manner as to show ‘deliberate indifference’ to the risk that not \naddressing the need will result in constitutional violations.”  Baker v. District of Columbia, 326 \nF.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003). \ni.  The District’s liability for overdetentions caused by the DOC’s  \nenforcement of the District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” rule \n \nThe District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” rule directly implicates the District’s government in the \noverdetention  problem.    That  rule,  although  not  enforced  since  March  2009, i s  clearly  an \nexample of an “express municipal policy” that could lead to Section 1983 liability for the \nDistrict, whether or not the District was “deliberately indifferent” to the overdetention problem.  \nSection 1983 creates liability for a local government when “the action that is alleged to be \nunconstitutional  implements  or  executes  a[n]  .  . . or dinance  . .   . of ficially  adopted  and \npromulgated by that body’s officers.”  Monell, 436 U.S. at 690.  “[E]ven a single decision by a \n[legislative body] unquestionably constitutes an act of official government policy.”  Pembaur v. \nCity of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480 (1986).  Overdetentions caused by the District’s ordinance \nare  clearly  constitutional  violations  executed  in  accordance  with  District  policy  officially \nadopted and promulgated by the Council.  See Monell, 436 U.S. at 690.  The District has failed to \noffer  any  argument  contradicting  this  conclusion.   C onsequently,  as  to  overdetentions  that \noccurred at any time during the class period that were caused by the DOC’s enforcement of that \nordinance, plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment as to the District’s liability.   \nTherefore  the  Court  will  grant  plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  as  to  the \nDistrict’s liability for any overdetentions that occurred during the class period that were caused \nby the DOC’s enforcement of the District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” rule, and will deny the District’s \nMotion for Summary Judgment with respect to those particular overdetentions. \n \n30 \n \n\nii.  The  District’s  liability  for  overdetentions  from  September  1, 20 05  to \nDecember 31, 2006 \n \nTo show that the District is liable for due process violations during this period, plaintiffs \nmust show that these violations were caused by a policy or custom of the District.  Monell, 436 \nU.S. at 690.  Plaintiffs’ primary argument, repeated throughout its Memorandum in Support of \nits Motion for Summary Judgment, for why the District is liable for the overdetention problems \nat the DOC is that they were caused by the District’s deliberate indifference.  In fact, both parties \nfocus their efforts on this one basis for municipal liability in their motions and supporting \ndocuments.  However, plaintiffs also claim, as a separate basis for Section 1983 liability, that the \noverdetention problem is the result of official “acquiescence in a longstanding practice or custom \nwhich constitutes the ‘standard operating procedure’ of the local government entity.”  Pls.’ Mem. \n[217-1] 49 (quoting Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 737 (1989)).      \nTo show that the District had a deliberately indifferent policy or custom with respect to \noverdetention  problems  at  the  DOC,  plaintiffs  must  demonstrate  that  the  District  failed  to \nrespond  to  a  need  in  a  manner  that  “amounts  to  ‘deliberate  indifference’  towards  the \nconstitutional rights of persons in its domain.”  Daskalea v. District of Columbia, 227 F.3d 433, \n441 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  Plaintiffs do not have to show that the District subjectively knew about the \noverdetention problem: the question is whether “the [District] knew or should have known of the \nrisk of constitutional violations, an objective standard.”  Baker, 326 F.3d at 1307.  Deliberate \nindifference  means  that,  “faced  with  actual  or  constructive  knowledge  that  its  agents  will \nprobably violate constitutional rights, the city may not adopt a policy of inaction.”  Warren v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \nPlaintiffs’  argument  for  the  District’s  deliberate  indifference  rests  primarily  on  the \nfollowing contentions: that the District was on notice as early as 2002, via the Bynum litigation, \n31 \n \n\nthat the DOC had a serious overdetention problem; that the District failed to intervene in any \nsignificant way to respond to that problem; that when the District did turn to the DOC’s release \nprocess, in the form of the “10 p.m. cut-off” rule in 2003, its actions in fact greatly exacerbated \nthe  overdetention  problem;  and  that  if  the  District  were  anything  other  than  deliberately \nindifferent to the overdetention problem, the disturbing pattern of thousands of overdetentions \nduring the class period would not show up in the evidence. \nThere is no dispute that the District was aware, or at least should have been aware, of \noverdetention problems at its jails beginning, at the latest, in 2002, when the Bynum lawsuit was \nfiled.  T he existence of the Bynum litigation, involving exactly the same issues, the same \ndefendant (the District), and even some of the same lawyers as this case, clearly put the District \non notice that absent significant intervention on its part, a pattern of unconstitutional behavior \nwould almost certainly continue at the DOC.  See Daskalea, 227 F.3d at 441. \nRegarding steps taken by the District to address the overdetention problem, the District \nargues that plaintiffs cannot, as a matter of law, show deliberate indifference because the District \ndidn’t adopt a “policy of inaction” after Bynum.  Def.’s Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. [228] 9.  \nHowever, as stated above, the District hasn’t provided any competent evidentiary support for this \nclaim that would apply to the first 16 months of the class period.  With the exception of a DOC \nstaff tour of “mega jail” facilities in October and November of 2006, every “proactive effort” \nidentified by the District and supported by competent evidence occurred in subsequent years of \nthe class period.  See Def.’s Mem. [211] 10 (New training program for Records Office staff in \n2007), 17 (Records Office implements staff “team approach” to release processing in 2007), 18 \n(“Discrepancy  reports”  used  to  track  overdetentions  beginning  in  2007),  19 ( Sentence-\ncomputation software implemented in 2007), 21 (Courthouse release program implemented in \n32 \n \n\nJuly 2008), 17 (Responsibility for the release of inmates from the CTF assumed by the Records \nOffice in late 2008), 18 (Records Office “modernized” in 2009), 22 (Assumption from the US \nMarshals of “jail board” responsibilities at the Superior Court in 2009), 19 (Changes to the \nPrisoner Transfer Report in “late 2009”), 20 (Weekly audits of JACCS data by Records Office \nAdministrator implemented in 2010).  Therefore, even assuming that the District’s facts as to \nremedial efforts taken during the class period are true as required in resolving a summary \njudgment motion, they are irrelevant to the District’s actions during the 16-month period in \nquestion -- September 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006 -- because they occurred during later years \nof the class period.  As such, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the District \n(and the DOC) failed to take action to remedy the overdetention problem during the first 16 \nmonths of the class period. \nFinally,  that  overdetentions  persisted  at  the  DOC,  in  large  numbers,  following  the \nsettlement of the Bynum litigation, as shown by plaintiffs uncontroverted overdetention figures \nfor the first 16 months of the class period, is unsurprising given that the status quo remained \nlocked in place during that period.  While the Court does not have overdetention figures from \neither party that precisely track the 16-month period September 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006, \nplaintiffs’ numbers for the first 12 months of the class period (September 1, 2005 to August 31, \n2006) show that an estimated 3,092 overdetentions occurred.  Pls.’ Ex. 192 [213-15] ¶ 17.  This \nlarge number of overdetentions, combined with the District’s notice of the problem via the \nBynum litigation and complete lack of meaningful attention or action concerning the issue during \nthe period, provides specific and detailed evidence of a pattern of unconstitutional conduct that \nwas either condoned or deliberately ignored by the District.  See Daskalea, 227 F.3d at 441–42. \n33 \n \n\nWhile ordinarily the question of whether a municipality has a deliberately indifferent \npolicy or custom is for the jury, see Smith v. District of Columbia, 413 F.3d 86, 100 (D.C. Cir. \n2005), no reasonable jury could find on the basis of these facts that the District had a policy other \nthan deliberate indifference with respect to overdetentions at the DOC during the first 16 months \nof the class period.  This is not case where some actions of some level of usefulness were taken -\n- but no action.  Despite its knowledge of overdetentions problems at its jails, the District failed \nto respond to the need for changes in the DOC’s release practices in a manner that shows \ndeliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of persons within its domain. \nNor could a reasonable jury conclude that this deliberately indifferent District policy \nwasn’t the “moving force” behind the constitutional deprivations associated with  plaintiffs’ \noverdetentions.  Plaintiffs must prove that the District has a custom or practice that is the \n“moving force” behind the alleged violations.  Zearley v. Ackerman, 116 F. Supp. 2d 109, 114 \n(D.D.C. 2000).  “A deliberately indifferent policy or custom is deemed to be the moving force of \na constitutional injury if the conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.”  Smith, \n413 F.3d at 102.  The policy or custom must be closely related to the ultimate injury, and courts \nmust consider whether the injury would not have occurred in its absence.  Id.   \nAkin to proximate cause, the question of whether a policy or custom is the moving force \nbehind  alleged  constitutional  deprivations  is  normally  a  question  for  the  jury.    Id.    Here, \nhowever, there exists no genuine issue of material fact regarding the question of whether the \nDistrict’s deliberate indifference was the moving force behind the overdetentions that occurred \nduring the first 16 months of the class period.  Plaintiffs have presented evidence of a disturbing \npattern of overdetentions at the District’s jails during the period.  See Bd. of County Comm’rs of \nBryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 407–08 (1997) (“the existence of a pattern of tortious \n34 \n \n\nconduct by inadequately trained employees may tend to show that the lack of proper training . . . \nis the ‘moving force’ behind the plaintiff’s injury.”).  Combined with the District’s awareness of \nthe overdetention problem and its utter failure to intervene, the only reasonable inference that \ncan be drawn is that the District adopted, by condoning, the DOC’s misconduct.  In failing to \naddress the problems at the DOC resulting in overdetentions, it was highly predictable that the \nDistrict’s indifference “led directly to the very consequence that was so predictable.”  Id. at 409–\n10.  As such, there is no genuine issue regarding whether the District’s policy of deliberate \nindifference was the moving force behind these constitutional violations.  Had the District made \naddressing  the  overdetention  problem  a  true  priority  following  Bynum,  the  incidence  of \noverdetentions at the District’s jails during the early years of the class period would have reached \nthe acceptable levels seen today. \nTherefore  the  Court  will  grant  plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  as  to  the \nDistrict’s liability for overdetentions that occurred from September 1, 2005 up to and including \nDecember 31, 2006, and will deny the District’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to that same \nperiod. \niii. The  District’s  liability  for  overdetentions  from  January  1, 2007   to \nFebruary 25, 2008  \n \nThe  next  issue  concerns  whether  the  District  or  plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  summary \njudgment as to the District’s liability for the period January 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008.  The \nDistrict argues that it cannot be found to be deliberately indifferent as a matter of law because \nnumerous “proactive efforts” were undertaken by the District to reduce overdetentions.  Def.’s \nMem. [211] 13.   \nWith respect to reforms undertaken between January 1, 2007 and February 25, 2008, the \nDistrict points to the DOC’s implementation, in 2007, of a new training program for Records \n35 \n \n\nOffice staff and a system for tracking overdetentions as signs that steps have been taken to \naddress and monitor deficiencies in the DOC’s release process.  Def.’s Mem. [211] 10, 18.  Also \nin  2007, t o  address  the  problem  of  sentence  miscalculations  leading  to  overdetentions,  the \nRecords Office began using sentence-computation software.  Id. at 19.  While certainly not as \nsignificant as the reforms instituted by the DOC in the later years of the class period, the District \nhas provided some evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that it had intervened \nin a substantial way during this period to address the problems resulting in overdetentions.  On \nthe other hand, a jury could reasonably conclude that such efforts were so clearly inadequate as \nto indicate that the District continued its policy of deliberate indifference. \nFurthermore, there exists a significant factual dispute during this period as to the number \nof overdetentions, as indicated above.  Taking plaintiffs’ overdetentions numbers for the period \nas true, as is required on summary judgment, the evidence shows nearly 5,000 overdetentions \noccurred  from  the  start  of  the  class  period  to  February  2008, r esulting  in  an  average \noverdetention of about 48 hours.  Pls.’ Mem. [217-1] 3; Pls.’ Ex. 192 [213-15] at Attachment B-\n1.  A jury could conclude based upon this evidence that the District continued to avert its eyes to \na disturbing pattern of unconstitutional conduct by the DOC. \nTherefore the Court will deny both plaintiff’s and the District’s motions for summary \njudgment with respect to the District’s liability for overdetentions that occurred from January 1, \n2007 to February 25, 2008.18 \nIn summary, the Court will grant plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to the \nDistrict’s  liability  for  overdetentions  caused  throughout  the  class  period  by  the  DOC’s \nenforcement of the District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” rule, and will deny Defendant’s Motion for \n                                                           \n18 This ruling does not apply to overdetentions that occurred during this period because of the DOC’s enforcement \nof the District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” ordinance.  As to those overdetentions, the Court has determined that the District \nis liable as a matter of law. \n36 \n \n\nSummary Judgment as to that issue.  The Court will also grant plaintiff’s Motion as to the \nDistrict’s liability for the overdetentions of the plaintiffs and class members during the period \nSeptember 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006, and will deny the District’s Motion as to that same \nissue.  With respect to overdetentions that occurred during the next 13-month period -- January \n1, 2007 to February 25, 2008 -- that were not caused by the DOC’s enforcement of the District’s \n“10 p.m. cut-off” rule, the Court will deny both parties’ motions, finding genuine issues of \nmaterial fact exist with respect to both the predicate due process violations during that period and \nthe District’s liability.  Those issues will remain and will be determined at trial.  Finally, for the \nperiod February 26, 2008 to the present, and again excluding overdetentions caused by the “10 \np.m. cut-off” rule, the Court will grant the District’s Motion for Summary Judgment and deny \nplaintiffs’.19   \n3.  Fourth Amendment violations for the strip searches \nPlaintiffs also challenge the DOC’s policy of strip-searching court returns entitled to \nrelease without individualized suspicion, claiming that it violates the Fourth Amendment.  Pls.’ \nMem. [217-1] 55.  The DOC’s policy is to strip search all inmates “upon admission/commitment \ninto the facility . . . .”   Def.’s SMF [211-1], at Ex. 4.  In addition, strip searches may be \nconducted “where there is a reasonable belief that contraband may be concealed on the person.”  \nId.  One factor listed as providing a reasonable basis for strip searching an inmate is “exposure to \npublic areas.”  Id. \na.  Legal standard \n                                                           \n19 While the Court has held as a matter of law that the District is not liable for overdetentions that occurred from \nFebruary 26, 2008 forward that were not caused by the DOC’s enforcement of the District’s “10 p.m. cut-off” \nordinance, this ruling applies only to plaintiffs’ and class members’ constitutional claims as specified in plaintiffs’ \nSecond Amended Complaint.  Pls.’ Second Am. Compl. [12].   \n37 \n \n\nThe  Fourth  Amendment  guarantees  “[t]he  right  of  the  people  to  be  secure  in  their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”  U.S. Const. \namend. IV.  The Fourth Amendment’s touchstone is reasonableness, which “is measured in \nobjective terms by examining the totality of the circumstances.”  Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33, \n39 (1996).  The determination of the reasonableness of a search under the Fourth Amendment is \na question of law.  U.S. v. Zapata, 997 F.2d 751, 756 (10th Cir. 1993). \nThe Supreme Court, in the leading case in this area, Bell v. Wolfish, has stated that the \nreasonableness test “is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.  In each case \nit requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights \nthat the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in \nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.”  \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979).   \nSince the parties do not dispute the reasonableness of the scope20 of these strip searches \nor their location, the Court will consider only the second and third Bell factors. \ni.  Manner of the search \nPlaintiffs present conflicting evidence on the issue of whether the DOC conducts strip \nsearches in groups.  According to deposition testimony of a jail guard provided by plaintiffs, a \nfew jail guards are present during strip searches, but the other inmates line up in something \n                                                           \n20 The DOC’s strip searches of inmates involve the following steps, according to plaintiffs’ evidence.  Inmates \nremove their clothes and go through a process called a “dance.”  Lucas Dep. [235-1] 440:3–16.  The inmates run \ntheir fingers through their hair and move their ears back.  Id. at 440:18–21.  They open their mouths, lifting each \ncorner with their hands so the guards can see inside.  Id. at 441:1–3.  Then the inmates allow visual inspection of \ntheir arm pits and genital areas, and spread their buttocks.  Id. at 441:5–13.  “Once that’s done then they lift up their \nback feet, one, two, and it’s over.”  Id. at 441:14–15.  The District’s account of this process is similar, although it \ndoes not indicate that the DOC performs a visual inspection of the inmates’ genital areas.  Def.’s Mem. [211] 8.  \nThese facts suggest a visual body-cavity strip search of a scope that has been found reasonable in numerous cases \ninvolving strip searches of arrestees in the prison context.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 558;  Florence v. Bd. of Chosen \nFreeholders, 621 F.3d 296, 299 (3d Cir. 2010), cert. granted, 131 S. Ct. 1816 (2011); Bull v. City and County of San \nFrancisco, 595 F.3d 964, 968–69 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(en banc).   \n \n38 \n \n\ncalled  the  “bull  pen”  waiting  their  turn  to  be  searched.      Lucas  Dep.  [235-1]  442:11–16.  \nPlaintiffs’ only support for group searches that this Court can find in the record are the four \naffidavits plaintiffs cite in their Memorandum in Support.  Pls.’ Mem. [217-1] 59.  But only two \nof those affidavits can be understood to suggest that group strip searches were conducted.   \nOn the other hand, the District supplied an affidavit from the DOC’s Chief of Security \nstating that inmates are not group strip searched.  Watford Decl. [243-2] ¶ 3.  The District’s \nposition is supported by a video of the DC Jail’s strip-search process recently provided to the \nCourt by the District, which clearly shows inmates being searched one-by-one.  Even setting \naside the District’s contention that group strip searches of inmates have been upheld in other \ncircuits, Def.’s Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. [228] 24, there exists a genuine dispute as to whether \ngroup strip searches have been or are now used by the DOC.  Therefore the Court must accept, \nfor summary judgment purposes, the District’s facts indicating that the DOC does not conduct \ngroup strip searches. \nPlaintiffs’ also say that the DOC videotapes strip searches, suggesting that this is an \nunreasonable encroachment on the inmates’ privacy.  Pls.’ Opp’n Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. [229] 44.  \nIt presents the affidavit of a lawyer who says he viewed a videotape of a strip search conducted \nat the DC Jail sometime in 2010.  Pls.’ Ex. 1090 ¶ 1–3.  It is unclear whether the strip searches \nwere videotaped covertly or not.  Plaintiffs have not claimed, and have presented no evidence, \nthat any plaintiff or class member is depicted in any video recording of strip searches at the DC \nJail.   \nThe  District  says  that  the  DOC  began  videotaping  strip  searches  in  April  2008, i n \nresponse to a complaint from a trans-gender inmate.  Godwin Decl. [243-1] ¶ 3.  Before the DOC \nstopped videotaping strip searches in February 2011 -- after plaintiffs demanded production of \n39 \n \n\nthe  videos  --  the  DOC  had  a  policy  of  storing  only  the  most  current  72  hours  of  video \nelectronically.  Id.   \nCourts have found, although outside the prison context, that video surveillance is subject \nto a greater degree of scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment than a manual search.  U.S. v. \nGonzalez, 328 F.3d 543, 548 (9th Cir. 2003).  While prisoners lose many rights when they are \nlegitimately incarcerated, certain fundamental privacy rights are retained: “they are not like \nanimals in a zoo to be filmed and photographed at will . . . .”  Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 U.S. \n1, 5 n.2 (1978).  Nevertheless, whatever privacy rights prisoners do retain are severely limited by \n“what must be considered the paramount interest in institutional security.”  Hudson v. Palmer, \n468 U.S. 517, 528 (1984).   \nThe District has presented evidence that the videos were made in response to an inmate \ncomplaint, suggesting they were created for the legitimate purpose of monitoring the behavior of \ncorrectional  officers  and  prisoners  during  the  strip  searches.    Plaintiffs  have  presented  no \nevidence suggesting that the videotaping was excessive or undertaken for the amusement of \nDOC staff.  The reasonableness of the DOC’s policy of videotaping strip searches is supported \nby the District’s claim that only 72 hours of video was retained at any given time, limiting the \navailability of the videos for purposes other than investigating inmate or staff complaints within \nthat time period. \nLooking at these facts in the light most favorable to the District for summary judgment \npurposes, this factor as well weighs in favor of the reasonableness of the DOC’s strip-search \npolicy. \nii.  Justification for the search \n40 \n \n\nThis factor is very problematic for the DOC.  Plaintiffs argue that the District hasn’t \nsupported the DOC’s blanket strip-search policy by identifying the specific security concerns \njustifying the strip searches of court returns entitled to release absent individualized suspicion.  \nPls.’ Mem. [217-1] ¶ 57.  Plaintiffs go further, stating that the policy “serve[s] no peneological \n[sic] interest.”  Id.   \n  In  response,  the  District  offers  the  testimony  of  a  correctional  system  expert.   S he \nconcluded that the DOC’s policy of strip searching any persons who are returned to the jail \nfollowing exposure to the public furthers the “legitimate correctional purpose” of protecting the \n“safety of the public, detainees and staff, as well as the security of the correctional facility.”  \nDef.’s Ex. 6 ¶ 26.  The District provided contraband reports, showing various items that inmates \nhave attempted to smuggle into the jail, including razor blades, crack pipes, and makeshift \nweapons.  Def.’s Ex. 15.  These facts certainly support the reasonableness of a blanket strip-\nsearch policy, at least as far as it applies to persons who are legitimately introduced into the \ngeneral jail population. \n  The District’s only legal support for the DOC’s policy as applied to court returns entitled \nto release are the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Bull and the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Powell.  \nDef.’s Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. [228] 24.  The courts in both of those cases upheld against \nFourth Amendment challenges prison policies that authorized strip searches of arrestees absent \nindividualized suspicion.  Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964, 966 (9th Cir. \n2010) (en banc); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  But, as the \nDistrict concedes, both of those decisions involved blanket strip searches of arrestees, not court \nreturns entitled to release.  The assumption in those cases is that jails are processing new inmates \n41 \n \n\ninto the general population, and have determined that maintaining adequate security in that \npopulation requires a policy of blanket strip searches. \n  Here, however, the strip search class members are subjected to strip searches solely due \nto the fact that the DOC has made the unfortunate choice to bring them back into the general \ninmate population while the Records Office processes their releases, rather than temporarily \nhousing them apart from that population.  That choice creates the security problem that the \nDOC’s  strip  searches  are  designed  to  solve.    The  District  hasn’t  offered  any  penological \njustification for this choice.  The DOC has other alternatives, which it has either rejected or \ndragged its feet on, such as segregating court returns entitled to release in a separate area of the \njail or in the long-delayed Inmate Processing Center.  These alternatives would remedy the \nobvious inadequacy of the Medical Holding Unit as a solution to the strip search problem, given \nthat inmates at that facility whose releases are delayed end up back at the DC Jail or the CTF and \nstrip searched anyway because the MHU has no sleeping quarters.  These alternatives would \npermit the DOC to maintain adequate security  among the  general inmate population while \npermitting court returns entitled to release to avoid the humiliation of yet another visual body \ncavity strip search at the jail.21  \n  Courts have found that the more intrusive a search is upon personal rights -- and there can \nbe little doubt that visual body cavity strip searches are among the more intrusive forms of search \n-- the greater the showing must be from the government that the search is justified.  Justice v. \nCity  of  Peachtree  City,  961 F .2d  188, 192  (11th  Cir.  1992).    Since  there  is  no  adequate \n                                                           \n21 The Court also notes that the number of inmates that the DOC would have to accommodate in order to separate \nthem from the general jail population is very low.  Given that the DOC processes between 15,000 and 17,000 \nreleases each year, including both court-ordered releases and sentence expirations, the number of persons who return \nfrom court with release orders who would have to be segregated temporarily is less than 47.  Therefore the DOC \ncould respect the privacy rights of persons awaiting release pursuant to the DOC’s administrative release process at \nde minimis cost to the DOC.  Indeed, separating court returns from the general inmate population was one of the \nvery reforms promised by the District pursuant to the Bynum settlement agreement years ago.  Bynum, 412 F. Supp. \n2d 73, 83 (D.D.C. 2006). \n42 \n \n\njustification for the strip searching of court returns entitled to release without individualized \nsuspicion, the Court finds that this factor weighs heavily in favor of the unreasonableness of the \nDOC’s policy as applied to the strip-search class. \nThis Court is required to balance the need for the DOC’s strip searches of court returns \nentitled to release against the invasion of personal rights that these searches entail.  Bell, 441 \nU.S. at 559.  Strip searches, particularly body-cavity inspections, constitute significant invasions \nof inmates’ personal privacy.  Id. at 560; Florence, 621 F.3d at 307.  Such inspections “are \ninvasive and embarrassing.”  Bull, 595 F.3d at 975.  The invasions in this case are particularly \nsuspect given that they are happening to persons who are no longer prisoners in the eyes of the \nlaw, who  are not individually suspected of carrying contraband, and who are entitled to a \nrestoration of the rights they enjoyed prior to their imprisonment.  And the DOC’s invasion of \ntheir personal rights is balanced against nothing, because the DOC’s blanket strip searches of \ncourt returns entitled to release are needless, a product of the DOC’s insistence on maintaining a \npolicy that subjects free men and women to degrading treatment when reasonable alternatives are \nreadily available.   \nWhile the other Bell factors weigh in favor of a determination of reasonableness, the utter \nlack of a reasonable justification for the blanket strip searches of court returns entitled to release \nis so extreme that a conclusion of unreasonableness is compelled.  See Byrd v. Maricopa County \nSherriff’s Dep’t, 629 F.3d 1135, 1143 ( 9th Cir. 2011) (finding that a strip search violated the \nFourth  Amendment  when  two  Bell  factors  suggested  reasonableness  while  the  other  two \nsuggested  extreme  unreasonableness).    As  such,  the  DOC’s  blanket  strip  search  policy,  as \napplied to court returns entitled to release, is unreasonable and violates the Fourth Amendment \nof the Constitution. \n43 \n \n\nb.  The District’s liability  \nPlaintiffs can establish the District’s liability for the deprivation of constitutional rights \ninvolved in their strip searches if they show that these violations were caused by the execution of \nofficial  policy.    Monell,  436 U .S.  at  694.  “ Municipal  liability  attaches  only  where  the \ndecisionmaker possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action \nordered.”  Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 481–82 (1986).  Whether an official has \nauthority to make municipal policy is a question of state law.  Id. at 483. \nThe strip search policy in this case wasn’t set by a low-ranking municipal employee at \nthe DOC, but by its Director.  Def.’s SMF [211-1] at Ex. 4.  The Director heads the Department \nof Corrections, and is appointed by the Mayor.  D.C. Code § 24-211.01(a) (2011).  The DOC has \nthe  power  under  District  of  Columbia  law  to  promulgate  rules  and  regulations  for  the \ngovernment of the District’s correctional facilities, “with the approval of the Council . . . .”  Id.  \nAs such, the Director of the DOC has final policymaking authority with respect to the strip \nsearch policy at issue in this case.  See Proffit v. District of Columbia, 790 F. Supp. 304, 309 \n(D.D.C. 1991) (“[T]he Director of the D.C. Department of Corrections promulgated the search \npolicy at issue and, under D.C. law, is responsible for its enforcement as the final policymaking \nauthority.”).  Nor is there any doubt that the policy caused the constitutional deprivations in this \ncase, since these deprivations flowed directly from, and were mandated by, the policy.  See \nArnold v. District of Columbia, 211 F. Supp. 2d 144, 150 (D.D.C. 2002) (Noting that proof of \ncausation regarding an official policy requires only evidence of the policy statement itself).   \nTherefore,  because  plaintiffs  have  demonstrated  that  the  DOC’s  practice  of  strip \nsearching all court returns entitled to release, without individualized suspicion, violates the \nFourth Amendment, and because that policy was promulgated by an official with final authority \n44 \n \n\nto establish such policies for the District and caused plaintiffs’ and class members’ constitutional \ndeprivations, the District is liable. \nFor these reasons, the Court will grant plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to its \nFourth Amendment strip search claim against the District, and will deny the District’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment as to that same claim.  This ruling applies to all members of the strip search \nclass and all parts of the class period. \n4.  Fifth Amendment violations for the strip searches \nPlaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claim as to the strip searches fails.   \nThe Supreme Court has stated that “[w]here a particular Amendment provides an explicit \ntextual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of governmental behavior, that \nAmendment,  not  the  generalized  notion  of  substantive  due  process,  must  be  the  guide  for \nanalyzing these claims.”  Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273  (1994) (citations and internal \nquotations omitted).   \nThe Fourth Amendment, in prohibiting unreasonable searches, is clearly the explicit \ntextual source of constitutional protection against the governmental conduct alleged in this case.  \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to the reasonableness of the DOC’s strip searches of court returns entitled to \nrelease is properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, not the Fifth.  See Conn v. Gabbert, \n526 U.S. 286, 293 (1999); Lyles v. Micenko, 468 F. Supp. 2d 68, 73 n.5 (D.D.C. 2006). \nTherefore the Court denies plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment in regards to their \nFifth Amendment challenge to the strip searches, and grants defendant’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment as to that same issue. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Non-Consent Motion [292] to Strike “Defendant’s Notice Regarding \nFiling Analysis of Late Releases, Document Number 244.” \n \n45 \n \n\nPlaintiffs also move to strike from the record the District’s Notice Regarding Filing \nAnalysis of Releases, Def.’s Notice [244], Mar. 23, 2011, as well as Exhibit 1 to that Notice, \nwhich is a six-page DOC report titled, “Analysis of Releases between September 1, 2005 and \nAugust 31, 2006: Appropriate and Late Release Rates.”   \nThe District submitted that Notice and the attached report on March 23, 2011, about three \nweeks after it filed its Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment.  The District \nsays that it inadvertently failed to include the attached document along with its Opposition.  \nDef.’s Notice [244].  The “Analysis of Releases” is referenced several times in the District’s \nResponse to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute, which accompanied the \nDistrict’s Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment.  Every indication suggests \nthat  the  District’s  failure  to  include  the  document  was  a  mere  oversight.    Also,  plaintiffs \nthemselves entered the very same DOC report into the record well over a year ago, as an exhibit \nto Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Protective Order.  Pls.’ Opp’n Def.’s Mot. \nProtective Order [91-1], Mar. 3, 2010.   \nPlaintiffs seek to have the Notice and the attached “Analysis of Releases” report struck \non several grounds.  First, plaintiffs argue that the District’s Notice constitutes a modification of \nthe Court’s scheduling order in this case, and therefore should have been filed as a motion upon \n“good cause” under Rule 16(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Pls.’ Mot. Strike \n[292] 4.  Plaintiffs claim that the District, before submitting its “Analysis of Releases,” should \nhave asked for leave to reopen discovery.  Id.  This argument is meritless.  As an initial matter, \nmotions to strike are generally disfavored, and plaintiffs “must shoulder a formidable burden” for \nsuch a motion to be granted.  United States ex. rel. Hockett v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., \n498 F. Supp. 2d 25, 34–35 (D.D.C. 2007).  Plaintiffs themselves entered this very document into \n46 \n \n\nthe record in March 2010.  The Court is unable to fathom how plaintiffs could possibly be \nsurprised  or  prejudiced  by  the  District’s  minor  bungle,  given  that  plaintiffs  have  had  the \ndocument for well over a year and themselves put it into the record.  Nor have plaintiffs provided \nany basis for believing that the District’s failure to attach the document was anything other than a \nsimple oversight. \nSecond, plaintiffs argue that the “Analysis of Releases” should be struck because it \ndoesn’t qualify as an affidavit under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Pls.’ Mot. \nStrike [292] 6.  However, this “Analysis of Releases” doesn’t even purport to be an affidavit, \ndeclaration, or any type of sworn statement, so none of those requirements are in any way \ngermane. \nThird,  plaintiffs  argue  that  the  “Analysis  of  Releases”  expresses  expert  opinion \ntestimony, but that the District did not make the expert disclosures required by Rule 26 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Id. at 7.  But this “Analysis of Releases” doesn’t purport to be, \nand is not, expert witness testimony; it is clearly a report created by DOC staff, dated March 16, \n2007.    It  summarizes  the  Records  Office’s  analysis  of  several  thousand  inmate  jackets  to \ndetermine how many inmates were released late during the first year of the class period.  While \nthe document does not indicate its author, it says that it was created for the DOC’s former \nDirector, Devon Brown.  For these reasons, the document is not an expert report or expert \ntestimony, and so doesn’t implicate the disclosure requirements of Rule 26 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. \n  Therefore plaintiffs’ Motion will be denied. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Notice [306] in Response to Discrepancy Reports Submitted by the \nDistrict \n \n47 \n \n\nAt the June 1, 2011 hearing on the parties’ motions for summary judgment, the Court \nasked the District to provide additional evidence concerning the number of overdetentions during \nthe class period in order to correct a rather glaring defect in the District’s evidentiary support for \nits Motion for Summary Judgment.  In particular, the Court requested that the District provide \nthe actual “discrepancy reports” referred to in its Memorandum in Support of its Motion for \nSummary  Judgment.    See  Def.’s  Mem.  [211]  25.   T he  District  had  only  attached  to  its \nMemorandum graphical representations of discrepancy report data, which provided no proper \nevidentiary support for these overdetention numbers.  See Def.’s Ex. 7.  The Court also requested \nthat the District provide the definition of “overdetention” used by the DOC to arrive at these \noverdetention figures.   \nOn June 9, 2011, the District filed a Notice [301] of Filing Additional Evidence, and \ndelivered under seal to both the Court and plaintiffs a large collection DOC “discrepancy report” \nrecords of overdetentions for the period January 2007 to May 2011.  Def.’s Notice [302], Jun. 9, \n2011.  The District also supplied an affidavit from the DOC’s Records Administrator indicating \nthe definition of “overdetention” used in the creation of these records.  Souverain Decl. [301-2] ¶ \n3.  The DOC’s Records Administrator also stated her familiarity with these discrepancy reports, \nwhat they contain, and how overdetentions listed in them are identified.  Id.   \nOn June 21, 2011, plaintiffs’ filed this Notice [306] to respond to the District’s recent \nsubmission of additional evidence.  The Court has considered this Notice in its resolution of the \nparties’ motions for summary judgment.   \nThe Court has only a few comments on plaintiffs’ Notice.  Plaintiffs incorrectly state that \nthe discrepancy reports cover the period “March 1[,] 2007 to the present,”  Pls.’ Notice [306] \nJun. 21, 2011 at 2, but if plaintiffs had read a few more pages into the District’s evidence they \n48 \n \n\nwould have seen that in fact they cover the period January 2007 to May 2011.  Plaintiffs then \nopine that this evidence is only admissible “against the District” pursuant to Federal Rule of \nEvidence 801(d)(2)(C) and (D).  Id. at 3.  But it is this Court’s determination that the discrepancy \nreports are admissible hearsay pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), which creates an \nexception  to  the  hearsay  rule  for  business  records.   T herefore  the  discrepancy  reports  are \nadmissible for all purposes, not just against the District as desired by plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs also apparently object that the reports “by themselves do not establish that these \nwere the only over detentions [sic] during the period,” Pls.’ Notice [306] 3, but it is unclear what \nplaintiffs mean by this.  To the extent that plaintiffs’ and the District’s overdetention numbers \ncome into conflict, the jury can sort out whose numbers are credible.   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n \n  For the reasons stated herein, the Court will grant in part and deny in part plaintiffs’ \nMotion [217] for Summary Judgment, and will grant in part and deny in part the District’s \nMotion [211] for Summary Judgment.  The Court will also deny plaintiffs’ Non-Consent Motion \n[271] to Strike “Defendant’s Notice Regarding Correction in Defendant’s Response to Plaintiffs’ \nStatement of Material Facts Not in Dispute, Document Number 228-7” and deny plaintiffs’ Non-\nConsent Motion [292] to Strike “Defendant’s Notice Regarding Filing Analysis of Late Releases, \nDocument Number 244.” \n  A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue this date. \n  Signed by Royce C.

See Pls.’ Am. Proposed Trial Plan [326], Nov. 29, 2011.  In these \nsubmissions, the parties present a number of proposals for going forward with what remains of \nthe liability phase of this case, as well as the subsequent damages phase.  Upon consideration of \nthe parties’ proposals, their objections and responses, the entire record in this case, and the \napplicable law, the Court has determined a plan for proceeding while also resolving certain \npreliminary issues in a manner that will expedite resolution of this litigation. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nAs is more fully explained in this Court’s earlier opinions, see, e.g., Barnes v. District of \nColumbia, 793 F. Supp. 2d 260, 265 (D.D.C. 2011), this case involves overdetentions and strip \nsearches at the District’s jail facilities.  This is the second of two virtually identical class actions \nfiled against the District in the past ten years involving overdetentions and strip searches at its \njails.  The first one, Bynum v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 02-956 (RCL), settled in \nJanuary 2006 pursuant to an agreement containing terms designed to remedy the overdetention \nand strip-search problems.  Bynum, 412 F. Supp. 2d 73 (D.D.C. 2006).  Among these terms was \n\na requirement that the District set aside $3 million from the $12 million settlement amount to \nbuild a new inmate processing center.  Id. at 83.   \nThis Court was initially hopeful that the Bynum settlement would produce “significant \npolicy changes in the operation of the Department of Corrections.”  Id. at 85.  But, as it turns out, \nthe  overdetention  and  strip-search  problems  continued  unabated  for  well  over  a  year, \nprecipitating the filing of the instant lawsuit.  Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 267–68.  In February \n2006, Carl Barnes and several other named plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nalleging  that  their  overdetentions  and  strip  searches  violated  various  amendments  to  the \nConstitution and the District was liable.  Pls.’ Second Am. Compl. [12] ¶¶43, 44.  The Court \nlater certified the case as a class action.  Barnes v. District of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. 113, 120 \n(D.D.C. 2007).  Specifically, the Court certified the case as a hybrid class action, with plaintiffs’ \nclaims for injunctive and declaratory relief certified under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure and plaintiffs’ claims for “monetary damages” certified under Rule 23(b)(3).  Id. \nat 124.  The Court defined both an “overdetention” and “strip search” class, id. at 120–21, and \nlater ordered that the case be bifurcated into liability and damages phases.  Order [65], Aug. 31, \n2009. \nAfter discovery as to liability concluded, the parties filed cross-motions for summary \njudgment, and the Court ruled on those motions in June 2011.  Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 273–\n91.  The Court held, inter alia, that the District was liable for overdetentions that occurred at its \njail facilities from September 1, 2005 up to and including December 31, 2006.  Id. at 285.  The \nCourt determined that genuine issues of material fact precluded a finding of summary judgment \nfor plaintiffs or the District as to the District’s liability for overdetentions that occurred from \nJanuary 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008.  Id. at 286.  As to overdetentions that occurred from \nFebruary 26, 2008 to the present, the Court found that the District was not liable as a matter of \n2 \n \n\nlaw.  Id.  However, as to any overdetentions caused by the DOC’s enforcement of an ordinance \ndubbed the “10 p.m. cut-off rule,” the Court found the District liable during all parts of the class \nperiod.  Id. at 283.  As to the DOC’s policy of strip searching court returns entitled to release, the \nCourt found that such class members’ Fourth Amendment rights were violated and that the \nDistrict was liable.  Id. at 291. \nFollowing the Court’s issuance of this ruling, and upon the request of the parties, the case \nwas stayed for sixty days and referred to a magistrate judge for mediation.  Order [311] Aug. 9, \n2011.  The parties, however, were apparently too far apart and settlement discussions failed.  \nThis brings us to the present moment, where a trial of the remaining issue of liability has yet to \nbe scheduled and significant questions remain regarding how the damages phase of the litigation \nshould proceed.  The parties’ inability to reach a settlement in this case may be due, at least in \npart, to lingering uncertainty about these issues. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nFederal trial courts have broad discretion to manage the conduct of litigation and to \nstructure trials in a manner that expedites the proceedings while achieving the core purposes of a \ntrial and protecting litigants’ rights.  As to class actions, which present unique problems of \nmanagement, Rule 23(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that in conducting a \nclass action, the court may issue orders that “determine the course of proceedings or prescribe \nmeasures to prevent undue repetition in presenting evidence or argument.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26(d)(1).  Trial courts have “both the duty and the broad authority to exercise control over a class \naction  and  to  enter  appropriate  orders  governing  the  conduct  of  counsel  and  the  parties.”  \nHoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U.S. 165, 171 (1989). \n \n \n3 \n \n\nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Preliminary Issues \nAs an initial matter, plaintiffs have indicated their intent to seek leave to amend their \ncomplaint “to clarify their theories of liability[] and the damages flowing from them” and to also \nfile another motion for summary judgment as to the District’s liability for overdetentions during \nthe disputed period—i.e., January 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008.  Pls.’ Proposed Trial Plan [319] \n3.  The Court hereby advises plaintiffs, however, that it will not grant a motion for leave to \namend the complaint and will not entertain further motions for summary judgment.   \nPlaintiffs filed their original Complaint in February 2006, amending it a day later (mostly \nto add an additional named plaintiff).  See Compl. [1], Feb. 23, 2006; Am. Compl. [3] Feb. 24, \n2006.  The case then proceeded through a motion-to-dismiss stage, class certification, a round of \nmediation,  a  protracted  and  cantankerous  period  of  fact  and  expert  discovery,  motions  for \nsummary judgment, and another round of mediation, and only now—six years into the case—do \nplaintiffs propose to re-amend their Complaint.  While leave to amend pleadings should be freely \ngranted “when justice so requires,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), a court may deny a motion for leave to \namend if it finds “undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated \nfailure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, [or] undue prejudice to the \nopposing party.”  In re Papst Licensing GmbH & Co. KG Litigation, 762 F. Supp. 2d 56, 59 \n(D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Forman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)).  Plaintiffs provide no \njustification for why these additional theories of liability and “clarification” of their requested \ndamages were not pursued in a timely motion for leave years ago, and their failure to seek leave \nearlier unduly prejudices the District, needlessly taxes this Court’s resources, and will delay the \nresolution of this litigation.  If leave is sought, it shall not be granted. \n4 \n \n\nFor similar reasons, the Court will not entertain further motions for summary judgment.  \nPlaintiffs had ample opportunity to explore theories concerning the District’s liability in their \nfirst, 59-page motion for summary judgment (along with its 93-page Statement of Material Facts \nand many hundreds of pages of exhibits).  By neglecting, despite its voluminous filings, to fully \nmake  their  case  at  that  stage,  and  by  seeking  now  to  reopen  summary-judgment  briefing, \nplaintiffs  would  only  further  protract  this  already  protracted  litigation  while  depriving  the \nDistrict of the opportunity to explore its defenses to these theories in discovery and increasing \nthe litigation expenses of all parties.  Furthermore, plaintiffs offer no legal support for the \nproposition that after resolution of cross-motions for summary judgment, and absent a showing \nof compelling circumstances, a party can simply seek a “re-do” of issues already litigated.  If \nplaintiffs wish, they may file a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 54(b) seeking modification of the Court’s summary-judgment Order—and plaintiffs \nhave already done so with regard to certain aspects of that Order, see Pl.’s Mot. Reconsideration \n[320], Nov. 1, 2011—but the Court advises plaintiffs that the standard for reconsideration is a \nstringent one.  See Ficken v. Golden, 696 F. Supp. 2d 21, 35 (D.D.C. 2010). \nB.  Liability Trial of the Disputed Period and Additional Discovery \nThe parties’ competing trial plans also address the upcoming liability trial of the disputed \nperiod and additional fact and expert discovery that may be required prior to that trial.  This \nwould require the Court to reopen discovery, since liability-phase fact discovery closed on \nNovember 5, 2010, Order [176] 3, Dec. 6, 2010, and expert fact discovery closed on December \n31, 2010.  Order [185] 4, Dec. 16, 2010.  Although it is not entirely clear from plaintiffs’ \nproposals precisely what additional discovery they need to try the remaining liability issues in \nthis case, the District agrees that discovery should be at least partially reopened prior to the \nliability trial.  Def.’s Proposal [317] 2.  The District, however—rightly concerned that such \n5 \n \n\ndiscovery could easily tread on miles of already trodden ground—seeks to limit this discovery to \nthe number of alleged overdetentions during the disputed period that are projected or identified \nby plaintiffs and the District.  Id.  Per its proposal, the District argues than no additional \ndiscovery on “process”—i.e., the DOC’s practices and procedures resulting in overdetentions or \nstrip searches—or related topics should be permitted.   \nThe  Court  agrees  with  the  District.    In  disposing  of  the  parties’  cross-motions  for \nsummary judgment, this Court held that there exist genuine issues of material fact regarding how \nmany overdetentions occurred from January 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008 and whether the \nDistrict showed deliberate indifference to the overdetention problem by failing to make a serious \neffort to address that known problem during the period.  Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 285–86.  To \nthe extent that any additional liability-phase discovery is necessary at all, it shall be limited to \nsuch discovery as will assist each party in determining how many overdetentions occurred during \nthe disputed period.  This number is relevant (aside from its relevance to damages) to the issue of \nwhether, in this Section 1983 case, a predicate constitutional violation occurred that could serve \nas the basis for the District’s liability.  Once the jury determines which party’s overdetention \nfigures for the disputed period are the most credible, it will compare that number to other \nrelevant information—such as the number of releases processed by the DOC each year—to \ndetermine whether the overdetention class members’ due process rights were violated.  See id. at \n281.    Discovery  beyond  this  narrow  issue  would  needlessly  prolong  this  litigation,  since \nplaintiffs  had  ample  opportunity  to  probe  such  areas  prior  to  the  close  of  liability-phase \ndiscovery.  Furthermore, the utility of such discovery at this stage of the case would likely be \nhampered by the passage of time and its effect on witness memories and the availability of \nrelevant evidence. \n6 \n \n\nThe  District  suggests  that  120  days  would  be  sufficient  to  complete  this  additional \ndiscovery, with updates to plaintiffs’ expert report served on the District within the first 60 days \nof this period.  Def.’s Proposal [317] 2.  The Court finds that this constitutes a reasonable \nproposal and will therefore order that this limited, additional fact discovery period shall close \n120 days from the date of this Memorandum and Order.  Any updated expert reports of either \nparty shall be exchanged no later than 60 days from the date of this Memorandum and Order.  \nHowever, as to the District’s request that the Court refer all remaining liability-discovery issues \nto a magistrate judge, id. at 2–3, that request is denied. \nC.  Damages Discovery and Trial \nThe parties’ most significant disagreement in their proposals concerns how the damages \ntrial in this case will proceed.   \nThere has been some evolution in plaintiffs’ views on this issue since the case was filed.  \nIn the trial plan submitted by plaintiffs in May 2006, they proposed determining damages via “a \nsingle, class-wide damages trial using ‘sampling,’” Pls.’ Proposed Trial Plan [7-30] 4, May 24, \n2006, by which they meant “randomly selecting a fraction of the plaintiffs in the class, trying the \ndamages of each plaintiff in the sample to a jury, extrapolating the sample damage award to \ndetermine damages for the class as a whole, and then distributing the class damages among class \nmembers according to a formula . . . .”  Id. at 5.  Plaintiffs further suggested that “an expert \nworking under the supervision of a special master” could generate the random sample.  Id.  Some \nsort of discovery as to this group of class members would then take place, after which the \nparties’ experts could propose competing extrapolations for the entire class.  Id.  Plaintiffs also \nproposed, as an alternative to random sampling, that damages could be tried by “mini-trials” to \njudges, without providing any further explanation.  Id. at 4.  Plaintiffs, however, emphasized that \n7 \n \n\nrandom sampling was the best approach, and would produce “substantial savings in time and \nexpense.”  Id. at 10.   \nAs to the type of damages plaintiffs would seek to prove, in this original trial plan, \nplaintiffs referred to such damages generally as “compensatory damages,” id., which included \n“non-economic damages” as well as damages for intangible injuries such as pain and suffering.  \nId. at 11.  Plaintiffs also indicated that emotional distress damages could also be determined via \nsampling, indicating that they might be seeking those as well.  Id. at 16.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint, \namong  other  types  of  relief  sought,  states  that  plaintiffs  would  seek  “compensatory”  and \n“consequential damages” and “such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.”  Am. \nCompl. [3] 25.  The scope of the damages sought remained hazy.  Ultimately this Court certified \nplaintiffs’ claims for “monetary damages” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), \nwithout indicating which specific damages were included.  Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at 120. \nThe District, in its recently submitted trial plan, sets forth a plan for discovery and trial of \ndamages that is almost exactly the same as plaintiffs’ original plan.  The District proposes to take \n“a statistically valid, random sample . . . of all class members to determine general damages for \nboth the overdetention and strip search classes.”  Def.’s Proposal [317] 3.  The most significant \ndifference  between  plaintiffs’  original  proposal  and  the  District’s  current  proposal  is  that \nplaintiffs’ proposed using random sampling for all damages, while the District proposes only \nusing such sampling techniques to determine “general” damages.  The District contends that any \nother method would violate its “due process” rights,  id., and that no matter what method is \nchosen—i.e.,  random  or  non-random  sampling—“emotional  distress”  damages  cannot  be \ndetermined on a classwide basis.  Id. at 11 (summarizing Augustin v. Jablonsky, 2011 WL \n4953982, *1 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2011)).  The District also proposes in its plan—in a parallel to \nplaintiffs’ proposal of an “expert working under the supervision of a special master,” Pls.’ \n8 \n \n\nProposed Trial Plan [7-30] 5—that the Court appoint a magistrate judge to oversee the selection \nof an “independent statistician,” agreeable to and paid for by both parties, who would determine \nthe size of a statistically valid random sample for the class.  Id.   \nHowever, in plaintiffs’ second trial proposal, submitted in October 2011, they put forth a \nplan for trying damages that was inconsistent not only with the District’s recent plan but also \nplaintiffs’ own trial plan from May 2006.  Instead of random sampling, plaintiffs proposed \nputting on a non-random sample of “20–30 class members” as well as the testimony of a \npsychiatric expert and a statistics expert.  Pls.’ Proposed Trial Plan [319] 21.  Plaintiffs stated \nthat, following testimony from this non-random sample of class members, it would ask the jury \n“to assign damages based on a matrix” keyed to the length of overdetentions (e.g., 0 to 12 hours, \n12 to 24 hours, and so forth), and  a separate  damages  assignment for strip searches.  Id.  \nPlaintiffs believe that there is support for this approach in this Circuit, citing the case of Dellums \nv. Powell, 566 F.2d 167 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  At least in this second trial plan, plaintiffs appeared to \nremain on the fence about what damages they were seeking, stating that it would depend on how \nthe Court decided to try the damages case.  Pls.’ Proposed Trial Plan [319] 28. \nIn  its  competing  trial  plan,  the  District  strenuously  objects  to  plaintiffs’  proposed \n“Dellums” method of determining damages, arguing that plaintiffs simply seek to “cherry-pick \n20 to 30 class members . . . without even the pretense that such a sample would be ‘random’ in \nany meaningful sense or would otherwise be representative of the damages of the class as a \nwhole.”  Def.’s Proposal [317] 6–7.  The District worries that plaintiffs will simply pick a group \nof testifying class members with “the most compelling stories to tell,” thereby inhibiting the \njury’s effort to accurately determine damages for the class as a whole.  Id. at 7.  For their part, \nplaintiffs expressed surprise at the District’s proposal to use random sampling (at one point even \n9 \n \n\ncalling it “cynical”), even though plaintiffs themselves proposed virtually the same plan early in \nthe case. \nHowever,  apparently  recognizing  that  the  District’s  arguments  in  its  trial  plan \nnecessitated modifications to their second proposed trial plan, plaintiffs proposed a third one at \nthe end of November 2011.  Pl.’s Am. Trial Plan [326] 1.  In this latest plan, plaintiffs propose to \nbifurcate the damages trial, trying “general” damages using the Dellums method and “special” \ndamages using random sampling.  Id. at 4.  Plaintiffs argue that this approach was recently \napproved by a federal court in New York, in a case involving a class of prisoners challenging a \nprison system’s strip-search policy.  Id. (citing Augustin, 2011 WL 4953982, at *1).  However, \nwhile the Augustin case did approve the use of a Dellums-style non-random sample to determine \ngeneral damages, plaintiffs appear to have overlooked the fact that that court determined that no \nclasswide  method  of  proof—random  or  non-random  sampling—would  suffice  to  prove  the \nspecial damages in that case.  Augustin, 2011 WL 4953982, at *16, *16 n.16. \nUpon consideration of the parties’ arguments and the applicable law, the Court finds that \nthe most just and expeditious method of trying damages in this case is to use, as plaintiffs \nsuggest in their latest proposal, the Dellums method, but only for determining general damages \nfor the class.  By “general” damages, the Court means the injury to human dignity that is \npresumed when a person is strip searched or overdetained.  See Augustin, 2011 WL 4953982, at \n*1.  In accordance with the Dellums method as well as the method used in Augustin, id. at *2, the \nparties shall each present the testimony of some members of the overdetention and strip-search \nclasses, up to fifteen in total for each party.   \nHowever, because this sample from the overdetention and strip search classes will not be \nchosen at random, but will be selected by the parties, this sample will not accurately represent \nthe varying circumstances of the absent class members or the varying impacts of the District’s \n10 \n \n\nconduct upon them.  The District could select, for example, fifteen career criminals from the \nclass—an unsympathetic group unlikely to be seriously affected by a single strip search or an \nextra day in jail.  Plaintiffs might pick a group with characteristics designed to elicit the most \nsympathy from the jury. This would be a trial of the 15 “best” and 15 “worst” cases, and so \nvirtually certain to produce a general-damages award that would not reflect the class members’ \nactual damages. \nTo avoid this result, the Court shall place restrictions on the types of testimony that either \nparty may elicit from the witnesses in this non-random sample of class member.  That testimony \nshall be limited solely to the details of such class members’ overdetentions and strip searches—\ne.g., when they were supposed to be released, whether they had been ordered released by a court \nor whether their sentences had expired, how long they were overdetained, how the strip search \nwas conducted, and so forth.  No testimony will be permitted that could lead the jury’s valuation \nastray by causing it to believe that the witness’ story was typical of the stories of the absent class \nmembers.    Therefore,  the  Court  will  not  permit  testimony  concerning  class  members’ \nbackgrounds—e.g., their occupations, education levels, criminal histories, family situations, and \nsimilar, personal facts.  Because the chosen witnesses will not be selected at random, such \ntestimony would mislead the jury by causing it to project these witnesses’ backgrounds onto the \nclass as whole, even though the backgrounds of the absent class members are likely to differ \nsubstantially from those of the witnesses selected by the parties.  For the same reason, the Court \nwill not permit testimony concerning the impact of these overdetentions or strip searches on \nthese testifying class members.  One witness might tell a story about the severe physical and \nemotional injury that he or she suffered as a result of the DOC’s conduct, while another witness \nmight testify that this conduct caused them no injury whatsoever.  While this might accurately \nreflect the level of injury suffered by those class members, it could not be relied upon by the jury \n11 \n \n\nto accurately value, for the entire class, the injury to human dignity that is necessarily entailed in \nbeing overdetained or strip searched.  Nor will expert testimony concerning the emotional or \nother impact of overdetentions or strip searches on class members be permitted, as the jury is \nperfectly capable of assessing that generalized injury themselves based on the class members’ \ntestimony, the parties’ arguments, and their own experiences.  As to the strip searches, the jury \nwill determine a dollar value for each strip search; for overdetentions, the jury will assign \ndamages using a matrix based upon the length of overdetentions—i.e., 0–12 hours, 0–24 hours, \n0–36 hours, and so forth.  To assist the jury in assigning values, the Court will allow expert \ntestimony that is limited to explaining the range of general damages that have been awarded by \njudges or juries in similar cases. \nWhile the District objects to the use of the Dellums method for any type of damages in \nthis case, including general damages, it agrees that the D.C. Circuit, in Dellums, found that the \ndistrict court’s use of a non-random sample of class members to determine damages was not an \nabuse of discretion.  Def.’s Proposal [317] 7 (citing Dellums, 566 F.2d at 189 n.56).  The District \nargues, based on out-of-circuit authority, that using non-random samples to determine damages \nviolates “fundamental fairness.”  Id. at 8 (citing In re Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 109 F.3d 1016 (5th \nCir. 1997)).  However, the Chevron case is inapposite, since that case involved a “bellwether”1 \ntrial  of  both  liability  and  damages  for  personal  injuries  sustained  from  contamination  of \nplaintiffs’ property with waste oil.  Chevron, 109 F.3d at 1017–18.  The Fifth Circuit decided \nthat the lower court’s decision to try liability and damages using the 15 “best” and 15 “worst” \ncases provided no assurance that the selected cases were representative of the 3,000 plaintiffs.  \n                                                           \n1 The Chevron Court provided a succinct and nicely worded description of the origins of the term “bellwether”: \n“The term bellwether is derived from the ancient practice of belling a wether (a male sheep) selected to lead his \nflock.  The ultimate success of the wether selected to wear the bell was determined by whether the flock had \nconfidence that the wether would not lead them astray, and so it is in the mass tort context.”  Chevron, 109 F.3d at \n1019. \n12 \n \n\nId. at 1019.  Only a statistically significant random sample of plaintiffs could achieve the \nnecessary representativeness.  Id.  Here, however, where a non-random sample of class members \nwill be used to try only general damages, and with testimony concerning the backgrounds and \nindividualized impacts of strip searches and overdetentions on such witnesses precluded, the \nCourt is unable to fathom how using a statistically random sample would perform any useful \nwork whatsoever, while necessarily increasing the complexity and costs of resolving the case.  \nThis will not be a trial of the 15 “best” and 15 “worst” cases, but simply the presentation of \nfactual testimony that will help the jury understand the conduct for which the District was found \nliable.  Furthermore, the District favorably discusses at length the Augustin case, which—as the \nDistrict notes, Def.’s Proposal [317] 10—expressly approved the use of a non-random sample of \nfact witnesses from the class to determine general damages.  Augustin, 2011 WL 4953982, at *1–\n2.  \nAs to “special” damages—such as damages for emotional distress, lost wages, or other \ntypes of compensatory damages other than general damages as defined above—the Court will \ndecertify the class as to such individualized damages.  While the Court previously certified \nplaintiffs’ claims for “monetary damages” generally pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at 120, plaintiffs’ clarification at this stage of their \nintention to seek special damages on a classwide basis necessitates this Court’s clarification that \nits class certification Order does not extend to such damages.  Because not all members of the \nstrip search and overdetention classes will have been impacted in the same way, because of \ndifferences in those experiences as well as differences in class members’ backgrounds and \npersonal characteristics, questions affecting individual members of the class will necessarily \npredominate over any questions of law or fact common to the class.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  \n13 \n \n\nTherefore certifying such damages under Rule 23(b)(3) is inappropriate.  Adjudication of claims \nfor special damages must proceed on an individual basis.2  \nD.  Injunctive Relief \nIn plaintiffs’ second trial plan, they indicated their intention to file motions for injunctive \nrelief on various issues.  Pls.’ Proposed Trial Plan [319] 6.  First, plaintiffs indicated their intent \nto seek injunctive relief related to the Court’s determination on summary judgment that the \nDOC’s policy of strip searching court releases violates the Fourth Amendment and that the \nDistrict is liable.   Id.   Second, plaintiffs seek “over-detention  relief,” id., arguing that the \nDistrict’s “10 p.m. cut-off rule” remains in effect.  Id. at 12.  Third, plaintiffs seek disgorgement \nof the $3 million set aside in the Bynum settlement to build an inmate processing center, which \nthe District has yet to complete.  Id. at 13.  The District generally opposes any injunctive relief, \narguing, inter alia, that various changes to the DOC’s practices render such relief moot.  Def.’s \nProposal [317] 12. \nThe Court finds that these issues related to injunctive relief are untimely and will defer \nconsideration of them until the conclusion of the liability trial on the disputed period.  Any \ndiscovery related to plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief shall take place at the same time as \nother damages discovery.   \n \n                                                           \n2 The Court also notes that contrary to plaintiffs’ contention, Pls.’ Am. Proposed Trial Plan [326] 11, the use of \nrandom sampling to try “all types of compensatory damages” is by no means an accepted method among courts.  \nWhile plaintiffs cite the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767 (9th Cir. 1996) to \nsupport the use of random sampling to try compensatory damages in a class action, Pls.’ Am. Proposed Trial Plan \n[326] 11, the decision in Hilao—by a divided panel and with a vigorous dissent—was justified by the unusual nature \nof the case, and has in any event been called into question by other courts.  See Augustin, 2011 WL 4953982, at *16 \nn.16.  Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a case that is famous for other reasons, recently disapproved a plan by a \nNinth Circuit court to forgo individualized proceedings and try class members’ claims for backpay using “Trial by \nFormula”—that is, the selection by a statistician of a statistically valid, random sample of class members, whose \nclaims for backpay would be tried and then extrapolated to arrive at an aggregate number for the class.  Wal-Mart, \nInc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2561 (2011).  Like plaintiffs in this case, the Ninth Circuit, in approving the random-\nsampling plan that the Supreme Court recently rejected, relied entirely upon its decision in Hilao v. Estate of \nMarcos, 103 F.3d 767 (9th Cir. 1996).  Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 603 F.3d 571, 625–28 (9th Cir. 2010), \noverruled by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011). \n14 \n \n\nIV.  CONCLUSION \nAccordingly, it is hereby \nORDERED that the Court will permit no further amendments to plaintiffs’ complaint; \nand it is further \nORDERED that no further summary-judgment motions will be permitted; and it is further \nORDERED that limited fact and expert discovery as to liability shall be reopened.  Only \nsuch discovery as will assist the parties in determining how many overdetentions occurred from \nJanuary 1, 2007 to February 25, 2008 will be permitted.  No discovery on “process” and related \nissues shall be permitted.  This limited discovery period shall begin today and close on April 6, \n2012.  Any updates to the parties’ expert reports shall be served on the other party no later than \nFebruary 10, 2012; and it is further \nORDERED  that  the  damages  trial  shall  proceed  following  the  trial  on  liability  and \nfollowing a period of damages discovery.  The damages trial will concern only general damages, \nand each party will be permitted to present the testimony of up to fifteen (15) witnesses drawn \nfrom the overdetention and strip-search classes.  Testimony from this non-representative sample \nof class members will be limited solely to the details of such class members’ overdetentions and \nstrip  searches,  and  no  testimony  concerning  their  backgrounds  or  the  impact  of  the \noverdetentions or strip searches upon them personally shall be permitted.  Other than expert \ntestimony concerning the number of overdetentions and strip searches, the only expert testimony \nthat shall be permitted will be such testimony as assists the jury in understanding the range of \ngeneral damages that have been awarded by judges or juries in similar cases; and it is further \nORDERED that plaintiffs’ claims for special damages are decertified and must proceed \non an individual basis; and it is further \n15 \n \n\nORDERED that discovery as to injunctive relief and motions for such relief shall take \nplace following the conclusion of the liability phase of this case. \nSO ORDERED. \nSigned by Royce C. Lamberth, Chief Judge, on December 7, 2011. \n \n \n16 \n ",

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \n19.  This Settlement Agreement is for settlement purposes only, and neither the fact \nof, nor any provision contained in, this Settlement Agreement or its exhibits, nor any action \ntaken hereunder, shall constitute, be construed as, or be admissible in evidence as, any admission \nof the validity of any claim or any fact alleged by any Plaintiff or Class Member in either this \naction or in any other pending or future action or of any wrongdoing, fault, violation of law, or \nliability of any kind on the part of the District or admission by the District of any claim or \nallegation made in this action or in any other action. Defendant denies all allegations of \nwrongdoing and denies any liability to Plaintiffs or to any Class Member. The Parties have \nagreed that, in order to avoid long and costly litigation, this dispute should be settled pursuant to \nthe terms of this Settlement Agreement, subject to the approval of the Court. \nIV. TERMS AND EFFECT OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n20.  This Agreement is a contract binding upon the Parties. The Court shall retain \njurisdiction over this matter and the Parties for the purpose of enforcing the terms of this \nAgreement. Plaintiffs’ acceptance of this Agreement is reflected by Class Counsel’s signature(s) \nupon this Agreement and is binding on the Class, subject to final approval by the Court. \n21.  The Parties enter into this Agreement solely for the purposes of this settlement \nand implementation of the settlement. In the event that Final Approval of this Settlement \nAgreement is not obtained or the Settlement Agreement is deemed null and void for any reason, \nthe Parties will revert to the positions they occupied prior to the execution of the Agreement, and \nnothing herein shall be deemed to waive any of the Parties’ claims, arguments, objections, or \ndefenses. \n22.  The Parties agree to move the Court, in the Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval \nof Settlement, to vacate the Court’s decertification of special damages (Dkt. No. 328; Dec. 7, \n2011). Should the Court decline to vacate that decision, this Agreement is null and void.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 5 of 28\n23.  The Parties agree that all objections and requests to be heard will be submitted to \nthe Court and counsel for the parties in writing and at least 30 days before the scheduled Fairness \nhearing. \n24.  Upon execution of this Agreement by the Parties, the Parties will notify the Court \nof this Settlement. The Parties will move the Court for an order preliminarily approving the \nsettlement and setting a fairness hearing. Prior to the fairness hearing, and as part of the Final \nApproval Order, the parties will move to dismiss the case with prejudice on the precondition that \nthe settlement is finally approved, and enter a proposed consent order dismissing the case with \nprejudice. The proposed Final Approval Order will also provide that the Court shall retain \njurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement. \n25.  A SCM who complies with the requirements set forth in this Settlement \nAgreement will be paid specified sums determined by the settlement distribution process set \nforth herein, which payment shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of that SCM. \n26.  The Settlement Agreement, once finally approved and effective (see definition of \neffective date in ¶ 10), resolves in full all claims, agreements, actions, cases, causes of action, \ncompromises, controversies, costs, damages, debts, demands, disputes, expenses, judgments, \nliabilities, payments, promises, claims for attorneys’ fees, and suits of any nature whatsoever, \nwhether or not known, against the District or its current and former agents, servants, officers, \nofficials, and/or employees, in their individual and official capacities, by all of the SCMs, \nincluding the named Plaintiffs, their agents, heirs, and assigns, involving violations of law or \nconstitutional rights, including, without limitation, their Fourth Amendment rights, their Fifth \nAmendment rights, or any other federal or District of Columbia law, regulation, duty, or \nobligation, or any other legal theory, action or cause of action, which are based upon or could be \nbased upon or arise from the facts alleged in the Lawsuit, i.e., claiming damages for \noverdetentions or strip searches occurring while in custody of the DOC that fit within the \ndefinition of the classes listed herein. When the Settlement Agreement is final, as of the \nEffective Date, all SCMs, including the named Plaintiffs, waive all rights to any and all claims \nrelating to overdetentions or strip searches by the District that occurred during the Class Period \nunder any theory or cause of action whatsoever under District of Columbia law and federal law. \nThis waiver and release shall include a full release and waiver of unknown rights based on \nclaims relating to overdetentions or strip searches by the District that occurred during the Class \nPeriod.  The Final Approval Order shall contain such a release and provide that it is binding on \nClass Members, even if they never received actual notice of the Lawsuit or this Agreement. \n27.  It is the Parties’ intent that, after the Effective Date, this Settlement Agreement \nbars any and all named plaintiffs and SCMs, and their privies, from bringing a subsequent suit or \nenforcement action in this court, or another, alleging the same or similar claims for relief as \ncontained in the complaint or in any amended complaints in this Lawsuit, with respect to any \nstrip search or overdetention by the District that occurred or may have occurred during the Class \nPeriod specified herein, based upon events occurring prior to the execution of the Settlement \nAgreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, the preceding \nsentence shall not bar or limit any action to enforce the terms of this Agreement. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 6 of 28\n28.  The Parties waive and assume the risk of any and all claims that exist as of the \ndate this Agreement is signed, which that Party does not know of or suspect to exist, whether \nthrough ignorance, oversight, error, negligence, or otherwise, with respect to either facts or law, \nand which, if known, would materially affect his/her/its decision to enter into this Agreement. \n29.  This Settlement Agreement, together with its exhibits, contains all the terms and \nconditions agreed upon by the Parties hereto regarding the subject matter of the instant \nproceeding, and no oral agreement entered into at any time nor any written agreement entered \ninto prior to the execution of this Settlement Agreement shall be deemed to exist, or to bind the \nParties hereto, or to vary the terms and conditions contained herein, except as expressly provided \nherein. \n30.  The Parties agree that failure to comply with the provisions of this Agreement \nshall not be a basis for entry of contempt or sanctions against the District. \n31.  This Settlement Agreement is subject to and conditioned on a Fairness Hearing \nconducted by the Court and the Final Approval of this Settlement Agreement and the issuance of \nthe final order and judgment of dismissal by the Court, providing the specified relief as set forth \nbelow, which relief shall be pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Settlement Agreement \nand the Parties’ performance of their continuing rights and obligations hereunder. The Order and \nJudgment shall be deemed final only on its “Effective Date” as defined in ¶ 10. Such final Order \nand Judgment shall: \na.  Dismiss with prejudice all claims in the action as to the District including all claims \nfor monetary damages, declaratory relief and injunctive relief, each side to bear their \nown costs and fees except as otherwise provided for in this Settlement Agreement; \nb.  Order that all SCMs are enjoined from asserting against the District, any and all \nclaims that any SCM had, has or may have in the future arising out of the facts \nalleged in the Lawsuit; \nc.  Release the District from the claims that any SCM has, had or may have, against the \nDistrict arising out of the facts alleged in the Lawsuit; \nd.  Determine that this Settlement Agreement is entered into in good faith, is reasonable, \nfair and adequate, and in the best interest of the Classes; and \ne.  Reserve the Court’s jurisdiction over the Parties to this Settlement Agreement. \nDisagreements between the parties on any disputes or unresolved aspects of the final \nOrder and Judgment shall be subject to mediation before the mediator used by the \nParties in July 2013. If mediation is not successful, the matter shall be brought to the \nCourt for resolution. In no event will any party be liable in contempt for any alleged \nor demonstrated violation of the final Order and Judgment, nor will any party be \nentitled to any attorney’s fees for any additional proceedings (in addition to those set \nforth herein) for any reason. \n32.  The Parties will take all necessary and appropriate steps to obtain preliminary and \nfinal approvals of the Settlement Agreement, and dismissal of the action with prejudice, all \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 7 of 28\nparties bearing their own fees and costs unless otherwise set forth in this Settlement Agreement. \nIf the Court gives final approval of this Settlement Agreement, and if there is an appeal from \nsuch decision, the District will not oppose Plaintiffs’ efforts to defend the Settlement Agreement. \n33.  The undersigned representatives of the Parties certify that they are fully \nauthorized to enter into and to execute the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to make \nsuch Agreement fully and legally binding upon and enforceable against every Party on whose \nbehalf they have executed this Agreement.  \n34.  The dates by which certain actions are to be taken will be established in the \nPreliminary Approval Order. \nV. RESOLUTION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS TO CLASS MEMBERS \n35.  The parties will jointly move the Court, at the same time as moving for \nPreliminary Approval of the settlement, to vacate its December 7, 2011 class decertification \norder (regarding special damages) and to adopt, for purposes of the settlement only, the class \ndefinition based on the combined ¶¶ 14 and 15 above. That class definition includes both liability \nand all damages. \n36.  The District will pay up to $2.9 million to SCMs as detailed below. \n37.  All funds not distributed to SCMs will revert to the District of Columbia General \nFund. \n38.  The Parties agree that this is a claims-made settlement, requiring a SCM to \nformally submit a valid and completed Proof of Claim and Release Form, under penalty of \nperjury, in order to qualify and receive payment under this Settlement Agreement. In addition to \nand separate from any other payments called for in this Agreement, the District agrees to pay a \nSCM who complies with the requirements set forth in this Settlement Agreement according to a \ntier payment process as follows: \na.  Strip Search Class Member: A Strip Search Class Member is a SCM who was \nsubjected to a post-release strip search during the Class Period (as defined in ¶14). \nThe District agrees to pay a SCM who qualifies as a Strip Search Class Member a \nsum of $1,000.00, no matter how many times the SCM was subjected to a strip search \nduring the Class Period. \nb.  Overdetention Class Member: A SCM who was overdetained during the \nOverdetention Class Period (as defined in ¶15). The District agrees to pay a SCM \nwho qualifies as an Overdetention Class Member a sum of $370.00 for the first \ncalendar day of overdetention, plus $250 per day for each succeeding calendar day of \noverdetention. \n39.  Notwithstanding the amounts set forth above to be paid to each class member, the \nparties have agreed to a maximum payout of $2.9 million. Accordingly, the amounts to be paid \nClass Members (not including class representatives) will be adjusted if the amount to be awarded \nSCMs exceeds $2.9 million. In that event, the amount that SCMs receive will be adjusted on a \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 8 of 28\npro-rated basis, which would result in payments to individual SCMs of amounts lower than those \nset forth above.  \n40.  The Parties agree that a cy pres fund is not necessary or warranted and no cy pres \nfund will be created under the terms of this settlement. \n41.  The District will pay $475,000 (less any amounts deducted for review of claims, \nas set out in Paragraph 45, below) to the DOC for programs for the benefit of inmates, which \nfunds shall be separate from and in addition to any other sums described in this \nAgreement.  These funds will not be disbursed until the review of claims, set out in Paragraph \n45, below, is complete.  The District will serve on Plaintiffs’ counsel a summary of the allocation \nof such funds, including a brief description of each program, how it benefits those being held in \ncustody, and the amount of each allocation, no later than August 31, 2014. \n42.  The District will pay $75,000, total, for the named plaintiffs and testifying \nplaintiffs. Allocation among the named and testifying plaintiffs will be determined by Class \nCounsel. \n43.  All payments by the District set forth in this Agreement are subject to the \navailability of an appropriation, and will not be made until the fiscal year starting October 1, \n2013, at the earliest. \nVI. NOTICE AND ADMINISTRATION \n44.  The District will pay up to $250,000 for class administration and notice costs to \nan Administrator. The duties of the Class Administrator shall be set forth in greater detail in the \nScope of Work to be sent to prospective Class Administrators. A contract for a Class \nAdministrator must be finalized no later than Twenty-one (21) days after the Court grants \npreliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement. Once the contract is finalized, this clause is \nno longer conditional.  \n45.  The District will pay up to $75,000 for a group of three third-party reviewers to \nreview all claims made by SCMs.  The parties will both solicit applications for third-party \nreviewers from among persons with expertise who are not former employees of the D.C. \nDepartment of Corrections.  All applicants must be willing to perform the review for twenty-\neight dollars ($28.00) per hour.  From among eligible applicants, the District will select one \nthird-party reviewer, and the Plaintiffs will select the second.  The two selected third-party \nreviewers will then select the third individual.  In performing the review, each reviewer will be \nrandomly assigned jackets from potential SCMs for a first review.  If the first reviewer concludes \nthat the SCM has a valid claim, that ruling will stand.  If the first reviewer concludes that the \nSCM does not have a valid claim, the other two reviewers will also review that SCMs jacket.  \nThe ruling by the majority of the three reviewers will then be final.  In the event $75,000 proves \ninsufficient to complete the review of claims, the District will utilize the following sources of \nfunds, in order, until review is complete: (1) any funds remaining from the $250,000 allocated \nfor Class Administration; (2) any funds remaining from the $425,000 estimated for plaintiffs’ \ncosts; (3) the $475,000 allocated for inmate-processing at the DOC. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 9 of 28\n46.  Any funds allocated but not spent under the terms of this Agreement, including \nfunds allocated to class members, shall revert to the District of Columbia General Fund.  \n47.  The Administrator shall be responsible for providing Class Notice. This shall \ncomprise mailing Class Notice and a Proof of Claim and Release Form by regular mail to all \nClass Members’ last known address.  The list of potential Class Members to-be-noticed shall be \nprovided by Plaintiffs.  The Administrator shall also use normal and customary means to search \nfor a Class Member’s last known address, including the use of a postal database, when mail is \nreturned, or whenever else it is appropriate in order to reasonably notify Class Members. In the \nevent a Notice to a Class Member’s last known address is returned as undeliverable, this will \nalso include making determinations of the location and current mailing address of Class \nMembers who are in state or federal prison, and re-sending notices to them at that address.   \n48.  The Class Notice shall describe the particulars of the case, provide the class \ndefinition, provide information for claimants to contact the Administrator for a claim form, and \nother usual and customary information. The Class Notice will be materially similar to the \nproposed Class Notice attached to this Settlement Agreement as Exhibit C. \n49.  The Administrator shall complete the mailing of Class Notice within two \nconsecutive business days. The second day of such mailing is the first day of the period for \ncalculating the “Bar Date” and the “Claims Filing Date” as provided in ¶¶ 3 and 4. \n50.  The Administrator shall be responsible for publishing a summary Class Notice as \nfollows: \na.  The newspaper. In a newspaper of general circulation, notice shall run on four \nseparate days, a week apart, over a four week period and shall be at least ¼ page in \nsize; and \nb.   Internet:  Notice shall be placed on the District’s Department of Corrections website \nfor One Hundred Twenty (120) days from the mailing of class notice ; and \nc.  Correctional Facilities: Notice shall be placed in a prominent location for One \nHundred Twenty (120) days from the mailing of class notice at the D.C. Jail and \nCorrectional Treatment Facility. \n51.  The Administrator shall be responsible for providing and receiving Proof of \nClaim and Release Forms. \na.  The Administrator shall, periodically, provide to the DOC copies of Proof of Claim \nand Release Forms received. \nb.  For those Claim and Release Forms that are sufficiently filled out and executed, the \nDOC shall retrieve the relevant claimant jackets, and provide them to the third party \nreviewers, described in ¶ 45.  The DOC will make all reasonable efforts to locate the \nrelevant claimant jackets given the information provided on the Claim and Release \nForms.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 10 of 28\nc.   The Administrator shall post the relevant settlement documents (specifically, the \nsettlement agreement, the preliminary approval order, the claim form, the class \nnotice, the motion for attorney’s fees court, the Final Approval Order and, if separate, \nthe final order regarding attorney’s fees and costs) on the internet on the website \nestablished for this case. Information about how to access this information will be \ncontained in the class notice.  The information shall remain on the internet until all \nthe checks to class members are mailed, and shall be periodically updated to address \nthe timing of such mailings.   \n52.  A Proof of Claim and Release Form shall be deemed timely submitted when \nreceived by the Administrator, or postmarked, on or before the Claims Filing Date. Facsimile or \nelectronic mail filings are not acceptable, will be deemed untimely filed, and shall not be \nconsidered by the Administrator.  \n53.  If a Class Member submits a timely claim form that is deficient in some respect, \nthe Administrator shall provide written notice by First Class Mail and a 30 day time limit to \nprovide a proper claim form, which notice shall inform the Class Members of what s/he must do \nin order to submit a proper claim. Failure to cure the deficiency within the 30-day time limit will \nbar any further rights for consideration of eligibility. Failure to fully and completely execute the \nindividual Proof of Claim and Release Form shall constitute a deficiency under this Paragraph, \nand all payments to Class Members are expressly conditioned on the full and complete execution \nof that release. \n54.  Untimely filed Proof of Claim and Release Forms shall be rejected by the \nAdministrator and no payment shall be made.  \n55.  The Administrator shall make payments to SCMs who have filed timely claims in \naccordance with this Settlement Agreement within a reasonable time, with a goal of making \npayment within 120 days after the Effective Date. If a check to a SCM is not cashed within three \nmonths of its mailing, the Administrator shall hold the funds for five additional months, during \nwhich time it shall make reasonable efforts to contact the person to whom the un-cashed check \nwas written to make arrangements for its cashing or reissuance. Any such funds not cashed \nwithin ten months of its mailing shall revert to the District. \n56.  The Administrator shall not make payment to any SCM until all claims have been \nsubmitted to the Administrator pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement, all verified \nclaims and payments have been calculated, and all disputes relating to claims have been \nresolved. However, if the amount of the claims is such that all claims – whether they are valid or \nnot – amount to less than the $2.9 Million allocated to SCMs under ¶¶35 and 38, then payments \nfor claims that are confirmed valid shall be made as soon as possible regardless of the pendency \nor possibility of disputes relating to other claims. \nVII. CLASS COUNSEL FEES \n57.  In addition to and separate from any other payments called for in this Agreement, \nthe District will, subject to final approval by the Court after SCMs have had the opportunity to \nfile any objections, pay Class Counsel $2 million, plus costs not to exceed $425,000.00. These \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 11 of 28\npayments represent a full and final settlement of all claims for past, present and future attorneys’ \nfees and all past, present and future ordinary and extraordinary costs related to the Lawsuit, \nincluding the cost of determining potential class members to receive notice, as described in ¶ 47. \n58.  Class Counsel agrees and acknowledges that they are personally and solely \nresponsible for any further taxes owed, if any, on the payments in ¶ 57 by any taxing authority, \nwhether federal, state or local. Plaintiffs and Class Counsel acknowledge and understand that the \nDistrict will report the payments to counsel set forth in this Agreement to the U.S. Internal \nRevenue Service. Reporting of payments to class members shall be the responsibility of the \nClass Administrator. \n59.  Payment to Class Counsel shall be made by wire transfer as directed by class \ncounsel immediately, but in any event no more than 30 days after the Effective Date. The \nDistrict’s obligation to make this Payment shall not accrue until Class Counsel has provided the \ninformation necessary to effectuate payment administratively, including the receipt of an original \nW-9 form and registration in the District’s electronic procurement system, “PASS,” for each \npayee. \nVIII.  PAYMENT LOGISTICS AND DISTRICT PROCUREMENT \n60.  All payments by the District set forth in this Agreement are subject to the \navailability of an appropriation, and will not be made until the fiscal year starting October 1, \n2013, at the earliest. \n61.  Subject to ¶ 59, the District will submit the payments proposed in this Settlement \nAgreement for appropriation once the Court has given its preliminary approval.  These \nappropriation requests will be processed as expediently as possible. \n62.  The Administrator cannot begin work under this agreement until payment is \nappropriated by the District for the Administrator contract.   \nIX. EXCLUSION FROM SETTLEMENT CLASS—OPT OUTS \n63.  Any Class Member who wishes to be excluded from the Settlement Class, i.e. any \n“Opt-Out” as defined in ¶ 11, must submit a request to be excluded from the class. The request \nfor exclusion must be delivered to the Administrator, or postmarked, on or before the Bar Date or \nas the Court may otherwise direct.  \n64.  Each Class Member who chooses not to Opt-Out from this Settlement shall be \ndeemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to his/her claim. \n65.  Any Class Member who does not Opt-Out as set forth in this Settlement \nAgreement, shall be deemed conclusively to have become a SCM and to be bound by the \nSettlement Agreement and all subsequent proceedings, orders and judgments herein.  \n66.  Any Class Member who exercises an Opt-Out, as set forth in ¶ 60, shall not share \nin any monetary benefits provided by this Settlement Agreement. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 12 of 28\n67.  The Administrator will report to the District’s counsel and Class Counsel all Opt-\nOuts upon receipt. \nX. INTEGRATION \n68.

Rules of Professional Conduct including but \nnot limited to Rule 5.6(b).  The Parties shall take no positions contrary to, or inconsistent with, \nthe terms of the Agreement. \n \nDATED: ___________  By and through \nOffice of the Attorney General \n \nIRVIN B.

Call toll-free________ \nor visit the following website:  _________________.com. (in Spanish) \n \n \nIf, between September 17, 2005, and July 31, 2013, you were incarcerated in \nthe District Columbia Jail and either strip searched after the time you were ordered \nor entitled to release, or were not released by midnight of the day on which you \nbecame entitled to release,  \n \nDistrict of Columbia records show that you may be a CLASS MEMBER.  \nTherefore, you may be entitled to receive MONEY.  To receive any money in this \npending Settlement, you must fill out and mail a Claim Form. \n \n \nThere is currently pending a class action lawsuit involving such issues in the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia.  The Court has certified the case \nas a class action, and there is a proposed Settlement.  If the proposed Settlement receives \nfinal court approval, CLASS MEMBERS are eligible to receive money. \n \n \nYour Claim Form \nmust be postmarked or received by the Administrator \nno later than _________ 2014. \n \nIf you wish to “opt out,” or be excluded from the Settlement, your opt-out \nletter must be postmarked or received by the Administrator by __________, 2014. \n \n \nIf You Wish to Claim Money, \nFill Out and Mail the Enclosed Claim Form Today. Do Not Wait. If you do not \nsubmit a claim on time, you will not receive any money, but will still be bound by \nthe Settlement. \n \nIf you receive more than one Claim Form, sign and file all Claim Forms you receive. \n   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 18 of 28\n \nNOTICE TO CLASS MEMBERS OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \nPLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AND COMPLETELY. A SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN \nPROPOSED IN THE BARNES CASE THAT MAY AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS \nWHO WERE INCARCERATED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA JAIL AND OTHER FACILITIES. \n \nWhy did you get this notice? \n \n1.  You should read this notice because you may be entitled to claim money from a class action \nsettlement. The purpose of this notice is to inform you about a proposed settlement in the \nBarnes lawsuit. The settlement may affect the rights of certain people who were incarcerated \nin facilities operated by the District of Columbia’s Department of Corrections. The \nsettlement is not final. In order for the settlement to be final, the judge in this case, the \nHonorable Royce Lamberth, will hear from class members who wish to be heard and will \nthen decide if the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If this notice applies to you, \nyou will have an opportunity to file a claim, and indicate in writing if you object to the \nsettlement, before the judge decides whether to approve it. However, to receive funds from \nthis lawsuit, you must file the accompanying proof of claim within the time explained in \nthis Notice. \n \n2.  The rest of this notice explains the Barnes lawsuit, how to determine whether this lawsuit \napplies to you, the key terms of the proposed settlement, and how you can file the appropriate \npapers regarding your participation in the settlement. \n \nDoes this notice apply to you? \n \n3.  This notice applies to you if you were incarcerated in the D.C. Jail, the Correctional \nTreatment Facility (“CTF”), or any other facility operated by the Department of Corrections, \nat any time from September 1, 2005 through July 31, 2013 (“the Class Period”), and were not \nreleased by midnight on the date on which you were entitled to be released. This notice also \napplies to you if you were incarcerated during the time period above, were taken to court \nfrom a DOC facility, were ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to \nrelease by virtue of the court appearance, and were strip searched prior to your release. \n \nWhat is this lawsuit about? \n \n4.  The Barnes lawsuit was brought in 2005 by a group of former inmates who believed that the \nDistrict of Columbia’s Department of Corrections kept them incarcerated past the time they \nwere supposed to be released, or subjected them to a strip search after they had been to court \nand were entitled to release because of the court appearance. The people who initially \nbrought the lawsuit, called the “named plaintiffs,” are Carl A. Barnes, Dernard Hawkins, \nDavid Peterson, Toney James Malloy, Maurice Williams, and Razina Jones. They filed the \nlawsuit on their own behalf and on behalf of all other persons like them (“plaintiffs”). Carl A. \nBarnes is no longer a named plaintiff, and two additional named plaintiffs – Tyree Speight \nand Myra Diggs – have been added. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 19 of 28\n5.  The plaintiffs sued the District of Columbia, whose agency, the Department of Corrections, \noperates the D.C. Jail and other facilities at which inmates are incarcerated. The District is \nthe “Defendant” here, the party being sued. \n \n6.  The plaintiffs and the defendant have written down their agreement in a document called a \n“Settlement Agreement.” Although, on __________, the judge preliminarily approved the \nagreement, the settlement is NOT FINAL. The settlement will be final only after the judge \napproves it after holding a public hearing called a “fairness hearing.” Before the judge \ndecides to approve the settlement, you can tell the judge if you do not like any part of it by \nfiling in writing what is called an “objection”, and you can ask the judge to let you speak at \nthe fairness hearing (although whether he will do so is strictly up to him) . \n \nWhat are the key terms of the Settlement Agreement? \n     \n7.  The Settlement Agreement provides for monetary compensation for each plaintiff, based on \nthe length of time they were “overdetained” and for qualifying strip searches. In exchange, \nthe settlement class members are releasing all claims related to overdetentions or strip \nsearches for the class period. \n \n8.  Without admitting any wrongdoing and to avoid litigating these claims, the Defendant has \nagreed to pay Six Million and Two Hundred Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents \n($6,200,000.00) (“the Total Settlement Amount”), which is divided as follows \n \na.  Two Million and Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents  ($2,900,000.00) to \nbe paid to the settlement class members (“Distribution Fund”);  \nb.  Two Million Dollars and Zero Cents ($2,000,000.00) for Plaintiffs’ counsel for \nattorneys’ fees and Four Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents \n($425,000.00) for costs incurred by Plaintiffs’ counsel;  \nc.  Seventy Five Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents ($75,000.00) for special payment to \nnamed Plaintiffs and other Plaintiffs who testified at trial, for their special assistance \nin the case;  \nd.  up to Seventy Five Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents ($75,000.00) for third-party \nreview of disputed claims;  \ne.  Four Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents ($475,000.00) to the \nDepartment of Corrections to improve inmate processing; and  \nf.  up to Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents ($250,000.00) for costs of \nadministering the class settlement. Class Counsel’s attorneys’ fees and costs remain \nsubject to Court approval. The Court will decide whether to approve these terms at \nthe “Fairness Hearing.” \n \n9.  The Distribution Fund will be distributed to Settlement Class Members who submit timely, \nvalid Proof of Claim and Release Forms. The payments to Settlement Class Members who \nsubmit timely, valid Proof of Claim and Release Forms shall be determined and paid \naccording to the following formula: \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 20 of 28\na.   Each Settlement Class Member who was subjected to an unlawful strip search \nduring the Class Period will receive $1,000.00, no matter how many times he or \nshe was strip searched. \nb.  Each Settlement Class Member who was overdetained during the Class Period \nwill receive $370.00 for the first day of overdetention, plus $250 per day for each \nsucceeding full day of overdetention. \nc.  Each Settlement Class Member may receive lower amounts. The Distribution \nFund shall be distributed according to the number of valid and timely Proof of \nClaim and Release Forms received. The amounts to be paid Settlement Class \nMembers (not including class representatives) will be adjusted if the amount to be \nawarded based on valid claims exceeds $2.9 million. In that event, the amount \nthat Settlement Class Members receive will be adjusted on a pro-rated basis, \nwhich will result in payments to individual Settlement Class Members of amounts \nlower than those set forth above.  \nd.  Whether a claim is valid or not will be determined by review of records of the \nD.C. Department of Corrections. The proper and complete execution of your \nclaim and release form is very important to that process because it will assist \nfinding you in the D.C. records. If D.C. is unable to locate you in its records, your  \nclaim cannot be evaluated, and therefore cannot be paid.  If D.C. is able to locate \nyou and your incarceration in its records based on your claim form, it will forward \nthem to a neutral group of third-party reviewers who will determine the validity of \nthe claim.  Determinations by the third-party reviewers are final and not subject to \nappeal. Because your claim form is so critical to determining the validity of \nyour claim, please be sure to complete it correctly, as your claim may not be \nable to be successfully processed if it is not accurate.   \n    \ne.  The settlement checks will be void if not cashed within six months. \n \n10. The parties expect that the amount allocated for each class will be sufficient to pay each class \nmember the amounts set forth previously based on the experience that not all class members \nfile claims. However, it is possible that the parties are wrong, and that the amounts to be paid \nto class members will have to be adjusted. Thus, it is important that you understand that this \nis possible. \n \nWhy Is This A Class Action? \n \n11. In a class action, one or more persons, called the Class Representative(s), sue on behalf of a \ngroup of people who have similar claims – the Class Members.  One court then resolves the \nissues for all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the class. \n \nAre There Lawyers Representing You? \n \n12. The Court has approved lawyers (called “Class Counsel”) to collectively represent you.  You \nwill not be asked to pay your own personal money for the services of these attorneys and \ntheir associates and staff in litigating this case and negotiating this Settlement.  Instead, the \nlawyers have sought payment from the defendants, subject to final approval of the Court, as \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 21 of 28\nis described further below.  Only Class Counsel may act on behalf of the class.  However, \nthat does not prevent you from hiring your own lawyer to advise you personally about your \nrights, options or obligations as a Class Member in this lawsuit.  If you want to be \nrepresented by your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense. \n \nWhat Do I Need To Do To Collect Money? \n \n13. To get money from the Settlement, you must complete the enclosed Proof of Claim and \nRelease Form, sign it, and mail it to the Claims Administrator on or before _________, 2014. \nBy accepting the terms of this settlement, you will be waiving your right to assert a claim \nagainst the District of Columbia as it applies to overdetentions and strip searches during the \nClass Period. Therefore, if you do not want to waive these claims, you should opt-out of this \nsettlement as described in section 17 of this Notice as set forth below. \n \n14. The name and address of the Claims Administrator are: ________ \n \n15. The Class Administrator maintains a website titled www.__________. You can go to it and \nobtain additional claim forms if you misplace yours. You can also obtain other information \nabout the case on the website. \n \nWhat Happens If I Do Nothing? \n \n16. If you do nothing, you will not receive any money. You will still be deemed part of the Class \nAction, and you will be releasing all claims you may have related to the allegations in the \ncase. Thus, it is very important that you act promptly to complete your claim form on \ntime or you will not receive money but will still have no right to sue the District on these \nsame issues. \n \nWhat Do I Need To Do If I Want To Request Exclusion or “Opt Out” From the \nSettlement? \n \n17. You may request to be excluded, or “opt out,” from the Settlement. Class Members who \nrequest to be excluded from the Settlement will NOT receive any money, nor will they have \nreleased their claims. They will then be entitled to pursue their claims individually. To \nrequest to be excluded from the Settlement, you must prepare and submit a written request \nwith your name and address. The request must state: “I do not want to be part of the plaintiff \nsettlement class in the Barnes Class Action Case.” The request must be signed by you and \nmailed to the Claims Administrator postmarked on or before _____________, 2014. (The \ncontact information for the Class Administrator is set out at ¶ 14. Note that the date to file an \nObjection is different from, and earlier than, the date to file a claim. \n \nWhat Must I Do To Object To the Settlement? \n \n18. Any Settlement Class Member may object to the Settlement, or to any settlement term. \nSettlement Class Members must object in writing. You must file any objection by ___. Note \nthat the date to file an Objection is different from, and earlier than, the date to file a claim. If \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 22 of 28\nyou object to any part of the Settlement Agreement and you want to tell the Judge, you have \nto do the following things: \n \n• You must write a letter to the Judge telling him what you do not like about the \nSettlement Agreement. Include your name, address, phone number, and signature in the \nletter. \n \n• On the first page of your letter write in large or underlined letters: “Civil Action No. 06-\ncv-0315 (RCL): Objections to Settlement Agreement in Barnes v. District of Columbia.” \n \n• Mail your letter to: \n \nThe Honorable Royce C. Lamberth \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \nE. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse \n333 Constitution Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC 20001 \n \n• You must also mail copies of your letter to the lawyers for the plaintiffs and defendant \nat the following addresses: \n \nBarnes Class Counsel \nBarrett S. Litt \nAttention: Paralegal Julia White \nKaye, McLane, Bednarski & Litt \n234 Colorado Blvd., Ste 230 \nPasadena, CA 91101 \n \n(Although there are other class counsel, it is this office that will handle issues related to \nthe settlement.) \n \nAND \n \nOffice of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia \nRe: Barnes Class Action \nAndrew J. Saindon, Assistant Attorney General \nAttention: Robin Massengale \n441 Fourth Street, NW, 6th Floor South \nWashington, DC 20001 \n \n• If you need help writing your objections, you may ask someone to object on your \nbehalf. The representative must state in the objection that he or she is your representative \nand explain the nature of the representation and the name of the class member. \n \n19. You may object to all or any part of the settlement.  \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 23 of 28\n20. DO NOT CALL THE COURT. THE COURT WILL NOT ACCEPT PHONE CALLS \nABOUT THIS. YOU MUST SUBMIT YOUR OBJECTIONS IN WRITING. \n \nWhat Is the Release of Claims? \n \n21. If you are a class member and have not excluded yourself from the class as described above, \nyou are waiving all your rights to all claims during the class period related to strip searches \nand overdetentions, including even those you are not aware of at present or do not suspect, in \nexchange for a monetary payment.  By participating, you will not be giving up any other \nclaim(s) that you may have against the District of Columbia not covered by this Settlement. \n \nBackground of Settlement. \n \n22. Plaintiffs’ lawyers believe that this Agreement is fair, reasonable, adequate, and is in the best \ninterest of the class because it provides compensation for past injuries, while acknowledging \nthat the DOC has substantially eliminated the problems the lawsuit was intended to address. \nAlthough Defendant denies that it has committed any wrongdoing, it believes that further \nlitigation would be protracted, expensive, and contrary to its best interests. Thus, the Parties \nentered into settlement negotiations which resulted in the settlement. The Honorable Royce \nC. Lamberth has determined on a preliminary basis that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate and in the best interests of the Class. \n \n23. The judge will retain jurisdiction over the case to decide any disputes about compliance with \nthe Settlement Agreement. \n \n24. You may obtain a copy of the entire Settlement Agreement on the Department of \nCorrections’ website at www.doc.dc.gov. \n \n25. The lawyers for the plaintiffs are Barrett S. Litt and William Claiborne. Class members do \nnot pay any fees to these lawyers. The fees are approved by the Court. The contact \ninformation for Plaintiffs’ counsel is contained in ¶ 18 (referring to Barnes Class Counsel)  \n \nWhen and where will the judge decide whether to approve the Settlement Agreement? \n \n26. A final fairness hearing will be held on ____________, at ______ __.m. before the \nHonorable Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia, \nat the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse. The courthouse is located at 333 \nConstitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001. The hearing will be held in courtroom \n22A. \n \n27. At the final fairness hearing, the judge will consider whether the settlement is fair, \nreasonable, and adequate. The judge will consider any objections that were made according \nto the procedures described above. Plaintiffs’ and defendant’s lawyers will be available to \nanswer any questions that the judge may have. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 24 of 28\n28. You may speak at the hearing only if you sent your objections to the judge in writing, and if \nthe judge determines he will allow those who object to speak. If he does, he may decide to \nallow some and not others to do so. \n \n29. If the judge decides to approve the settlement, his decision is final and the Lawsuit will end. \nThe class members will no longer be able to petition the courts for the same things they sued \nabout in the Barnes lawsuit. \n \n30. If the judge does not approve the settlement, the Lawsuit will continue. \n \nWhen Will I Receive Money From the Settlement? \n \n31. No money will be paid until after the Settlement is approved and all possibilities of appeal \nare completed.  After that, it will likely take two to three months, and quite possibly more, to \nprocess all the claims, calculate the amount due to each Class Member and receive the money \nto send to the Class Members.  If you file a claim and do not receive money within eight \nmonths after _________, 2014, which is the last day to mail or file a claim, check the website \nfor this case about when mailings are expected, or contact the Class Administrator by either \ncalling _________ or writing to the Class Administrator, whose contact information is \ncontained in ¶ 14. \n    \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 465-2   Filed 11/04/13   Page 25 of 28\n75.  Before this Settlement Agreement becomes final and binding on the Parties, the \nCourt shall hold a Fairness Hearing to determine whether to enter a Final Order of Approval. A \nproposed Final Order of Approval shall be submitted to the Court. In the event that a Final Order \nof Approval consistent with the terms set forth herein is not entered, either Party has the right to \nwithdraw from the settlement. \nXII. NO ADMISSION OR WAIVER \n76.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that all undertakings and agreements \ncontained in this Settlement Agreement have been agreed to solely for the purpose of finally \ncompromising and resolving all questions, disputes and issues between them relating to the \nlitigation. This Settlement Agreement and any proceedings taken pursuant hereto shall not in any \nevent be construed as, interpreted as, or deemed to be evidence of an admission or concession by \neither party for any purpose, or deemed to constitute a waiver of any legal position or any \ndefenses or other rights which either of the Parties might otherwise assert in any context. Neither \nthis Settlement Agreement nor any of its provisions nor any other documents related hereto nor \nany negotiations, statements or testimony taken in connection herewith may be offered or \nreceived in evidence in, or used for any other purpose, or in any suit, action or legal proceeding \nwhich either ofthem may now have or in the future have with any other person, as an admission \nor concession of liability or wrongdoing or as any admission or concession on the part of either \nparty, except in connection with any action or legal proceeding to enforce this Settlement \nAgreement. The Parties have reached this Settlement Agreement on a commercial basis through \narms-length negotiations and to avoid the costs and delays of further disputes, litigation and \nnegotiations among them. This Settlement Agreement has been entered into without any \nconcession of liability or non-liability whatsoever and has no precedential or evidentiary value \nwhatsoever. \nXIII. DUTY TO DEFEND AGREEMENT \n77.  The Parties and their counsel agree to defend this Agreement.  Counsel for \nPlaintiffs may not undertake the representation of objectors or persons who opt out ofthe \nsettlement in any matter substantially related to the Released Claims ifthat representation \nconflicts with Counsel for Plaintiffs' obligations as Class Counsel; however, this prohibition is \nnull and void to the extent it conflicts with the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct including but \nnot limited to Rule 5.6(b).  The Parties shall take no positions contrary to, or inconsistent with, \nthe terms ofthe Agreement. \n1I\" \nDATED:  II '0 By and through \nr' \nOffice ofthe Attorney General \nIRVIN B.

This is an action brought by each of Carl A. Barnes, Dernard \nHawkins, David Peterson and Maurice Williams (the “Overdetention Named \nPlaintiffs”) on his own behalf and on behalf of the class defined below injured (or \npresently subject to injury) by the Government of the District of Columbia’s \nrecently revived pattern and practice of allowing its Department of Corrections to \noverdetain inmates, and by the District’s deliberate indifference to the effect of the \npractice of overdetention on the rights of inmates.  To overdetain means holding a \ndetainee or prisoner in a District of Columbia Department of Corrections \n(\"Department of Corrections\") facility past midnight of his or her release date, as \ndefined below.   \n2.  This is also an action brought by Carl A. Barnes, David Peterson and \nMaurice Williams (the \"Strip Search Named Plaintiffs\") on his own behalf and on \n \n  2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 3 of 25\nbehalf of a Strip Search Class of individuals who were injured (or presently subject \nto injury) by the District’s conduct in subjecting them to blanket strip searches and \nvisual body cavity searches (both described below) after they were returned to a \nDepartment of Corrections facility after a judicial determination that there was no \nlonger a basis for their detention, other than to be processed for release, and by \nDistrict’s deliberate indifference to the effect of the practice of blanket strip \nsearches and visual body cavity searches on the rights of inmates. \n3.   The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs bring this action against the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce the Fourth, Fifth and Eighth \nAmendments, for injuries suffered by them, because the District overdetained them \nand other members of the class at a Department of Corrections facility. \n4.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action against the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, for \ninjuries suffered by them, because the District subjected them and the class to the \nblanket strip searches. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs \n \n  3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 4 of 25\nand Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nand 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3).   \n6.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  Each of the claims for relief \narose in this judicial district. \nClass Action Allegations \n7.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules \n23(a), 23(b) (2), of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class \nconsisting of: (a) Each person who has been, is, or in the future will be incarcerated \nin any District of Columbia Department of Corrections facility from September 1, \n2005 forward; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future, will not be released \nby midnight on the date on which the person is entitled to be released by court \norder or the date on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired. \n8.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs also bring this action under Rules \n23(a), 23(b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class \nconsisting of each member of the class who was, or in the future will be, from \nSeptember 1, 2005, forward: (i) in the custody of the Department of Corrections; \n(ii) taken to court from a Department of Corrections facility; (iii) ordered released \nby the court or otherwise became entitled to release by virtue of the court \nappearance because the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending \n \n  4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 5 of 25\nor was dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or \nhad posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was otherwise \nentitled to release; (iv) was not the subject of any other pending case or cases \nwhich imposed any condition of release other than personal recognizance; (v) was \nnot the subject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was returned from court to the DC \nJail or CTF or other District facility, to be processed out of Department of \nCorrections custody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or visual body \ncavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause that he was concealing contraband or weapons; before being \nreleased, regardless of whether he was overdetained. \n9.  Certification of these two classes under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate, because the District of Columbia has a pattern \nand practice that has uniformly affected all members of both classes, and injunctive \nrelief against the District will benefit each and every plaintiff and class member. \nAlthough the District had agreed to stop these practices, and indeed had done so in \nthe context of the settlement of Bynum v. District of Columbia , Civil Action No. \n02-956 (RCL), the final approval order did not require that the practices stop. \nThese practices have recently been revived, making it clear that a court order is \nnecessary to ensure the rights of the class members. \n \n  5\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 6 of 25\n10.  The classes are entitled to injunctive relief, for example, setting up an \nindependent monitor to supervise the Department of Corrections' inmate \nmanagement system to ensure that all inmates are released on or before their \nrelease dates, and other relief as specified below. \n11.  Regarding the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs, and members of the \nclass, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability other than whether \nan individual has been overdetained, and the answer to that question can be \ndetermined by ministerial inspection of the Department of Corrections' records. \n12.  Computer records are available for inspection on the overdetentions.  \n13.  Regarding the Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and members of the \nStrip Search Class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, \nbecause neither the DC Jail nor CTF keeps records of the searches and therefore \nneither the DC Jail nor CTF can show that any of the searches were conducted \nbased on an individual determination of reasonable suspicion. \n14.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the classes are: \na)   whether the Constitution provides a maximum length of \ntime measured in hours beyond which the District cannot hold a \nperson to perform administrative tasks incident to release before \nreleasing that person from jail;  \n \n  6\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 7 of 25\nb)   whether the District has exceeded that maximum for \neach class member; \nc)  whether the District has a pattern and practice of holding \ndetainees and inmates past their release dates; \nd)  whether the District has a pattern and practice of being \ndeliberately indifferent to the rights of detainees and inmates by \nholding them past their release dates; \ne)  whether the District’s acts as alleged herein violate the \nConstitution of the United States by holding detainees and inmates \npast their release dates; \nf)  whether the District has a policy of and practice of \nsubjecting persons to blanket strip searches and visual body cavity \nsearches after they have become entitled to release; \ng)  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth \nand/or Fifth Amendments; and \nh)  whether plaintiffs and the members of the Overdetention \nClass and the Strip Search Class and future members are entitled to \nequitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that relief. \n \n  7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 8 of 25\n15.  Each of the Overdetention Class and the Strip Search Class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The exact number of \nOverdetention Class and Strip Search Class members is unknown to plaintiffs at \nthis time, but is likely to consist of at least one hundred people, and likely \nsubstantially more than that. \n16.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims \nof the other members of the class, as plaintiffs and all other members of the class \nwere injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the overdetentions. \n17.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of \nthe other members of the Strip Search Class, as the Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nand all other members of the Strip Search Class were injured by exactly the same \nmeans, that is, by the blanket strip searches. \n18.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and the Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the \nOverdetention Class and Strip Search Class and have retained counsel who are \ncompetent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action litigation \nand/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n \n  8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 9 of 25\n19.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nhave no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class or Strip \nSearch Class. \nParties \n20.  Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes is currently being held past his Release Date \nat the DC Jail and was strip searched without reasonable suspicion after being \nordered to be released from custody. \n21.  Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins is currently being held past his Release \nDate at the DC Jail. \n22.  Plaintiff David Peterson is currently being held past his Release Date \nat the DC Jail and was strip searched without reasonable suspicion after being \nordered to be released from custody. \n23.  Plaintiff Maurice Williams is currently held in the DC Jail on a show \ncause order for probation violation issued by a District of Columbia Superior \nCourt, who has a hearing scheduled for 2/27/06, at which he is likely to be \nreleased, and after which he is likely to be overdetained and subjected to an illegal \ncourt return strip search. \n \n  9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 10 of 25\n24.  The District Government of the District of Columbia (hereinafter the \nDistrict of Columbia or the District) is a municipal corporation capable of being \nsued under D.C. Code § 1-102. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nComponents of the Department of Corrections \n25.  The District of Columbia Department of Corrections holds prisoners \ncommitted by the District of Columbia Superior Court, the District of Columbia \nDistrict Court, and other agencies, in the Central Detention Facility (“DC Jail”), \nthe Correctional Treatment Facility (\"CTF\") and at various halfway houses located \nin the District of Columbia. \n26.  Most prisoners held in the custody of the Department of Corrections \nare either pre-trial detainees, misdemeanants serving sentences, or parole and \nprobation violators.  \nThe Inmate Management System \n27.  The records office located at the DC Jail (\"Records Office\") is \nresponsible for administering and maintaining the records, including the judgment \nand commitment files, of all persons housed at the DC Jail, CTF and the halfway \nhouses. \n \n  10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 11 of 25\n28.  The Records Office is responsible for ensuring that all persons housed \nat the DC Jail, CTF and the halfway houses are released according to their Release \nDates specified in their court orders. \n29.  The District of Columbia Superior Court enforces a policy pursuant to \nwhich an in-custody-defendant or a defendant ordered into custody may not leave \nthe courtroom without an order (commitment order or release order) for each case \non which he appeared. \nThe Overdetention Problem \n30.  \"Overdetain\" means holding a detainee or prisoner in Department of \nCorrections' custody past the person’s release date. \n31.  “Release Date” for each detainee or inmate is the day on which the \nperson is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for \nhis or her detention has otherwise expired. \n32.  “Exit Date” for each detainee or inmate is the day on which the person \nis actually released from the custody of the District of Columbia Department of \nCorrections. \n33.  The Department of Corrections had a long and documented history of \noverdetaining detainees and inmates past their release dates.   \n \n  11\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 12 of 25\n34.  The Department of Corrections, in response to a class action lawsuit, \ninstituted reforms that ameliorated and for periods eliminated the overdetention \nproblem. \n35.  However, in the last few weeks before the filing of this complaint, \nand, on information and belief, particularly since late December 2005, the \nDepartment of Corrections has again begun overdetaining large numbers of \ninmates. \n36.  The overdetention problem has been especially severe in the last few \nweeks because of problems with the Department of Corrections’ computerized \ninmate population accounting system. \nThe Court Return Strip Search Problem \n37.  Prior to late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of Corrections \nfollowed a practice under which most inmates taken from custody of the \nDepartment of Corrections to court and ordered released by a judicial officer \nbecause the charge was no longer pending or because of a change in conditions of \nrelease was returned to the DC Jail or CTF for processing for release rather than \nbeing released from the courthouse. \n38.  In late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of Corrections instituted a \npolicy under which every inmates taken from custody of the Department of \n \n  12\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 13 of 25\nCorrections to court and ordered released by a judicial officer because the charge \nwas no longer pending or because of a change in conditions of release was returned \nto the DC Jail or CTF for processing for release rather than being released from the \ncourthouse. \n39.  In August 2005 the Department of Corrections instituted a policy of \ndiverting in-custody defendants ordered released or otherwise entitled to release \nfrom the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to a holding facility on the \ngrounds of DC General Hospital where they would not be subject to a strip search, \nabsent individualized suspicion, while the record review for detainers and warrants \nand property retrieval was conducted prior to release.  \n40.  However, in the last few weeks before the filing of this complaint, \nand, , on information and belief, particularly since late December 2005, the \nDepartment of Corrections has been returning some in-custody defendants entitled \nto release from the courthouses to the DC Jail or CTF and subjecting them to strip \nsearches after a judge has ordered their release without a finding of individual \nreasonable suspicion.  \n41.  The exact cause of the recent overdetentions and illegal court return \nstrip searches is not known, but the causes, on information and belief, include \nrecurring problems with the DC Jail’s computerized inmate population accounting \n \n  13\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 14 of 25\nsystem and the deliberate indifference of the acting warden Patricia Britton and the \nacting director Elwood York and the resignation of competent managers from the \nRecords Office. \nCarl A. Barnes’ Overdetention by the DC Jail \n42.  On or about 11/17/06 Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was committed to the \nDC Jail.  \n43.  Plaintiff Barnes’ Release Date was 2/15/06. \n44.  Plaintiff Barnes is currently being overdetained in the DC Jail. \n45.  Plaintiff Barnes has suffered damages as a result of the over detention. \nDernard Hawkins’ Overdetention by the DC Jail \n46.  On or about 2/15/06 Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins was committed to the \nDC Jail.  \n47.  Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins’ Release Date was on or about 2/16/06. \n48.  Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins is currently being overdetained at the DC \nJail. \n49.  Plaintiff Dernard Hawkins has suffered damages as a result of the \noverdetention. \n \n  14\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 15 of 25\nPlaintiff David Peterson’s Overdetention by the DC Jail \n50.  On or about 2/13/06 Plaintiff David Peterson was committed to the \nDC Jail. \n51.  Plaintiff Peterson's Release Date was 2/20/06. \n52.  But Plaintiff David Peterson was not released on 2/20/06 even though \nthe Department of Corrections lacked a basis to continue detaining him. \n53.  Plaintiff Peterson's is currently being overdetained in the DC Jail. \n54.  Plaintiff Peterson has suffered damages as a result of the \noverdetention. \nPlaintiff Carl A. Barnes’s Strip Search \n55.  On 2/15/06 Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was taken to the Superior Court \nand the Superior Court judge sentenced him to time served. \n56.  Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was entitled to release on 2/15/05. \n57.  But, instead of being released or diverted to the holding facility at DC \nGeneral on 2/15/06, Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was returned to the DC Jail’s general \npopulation and subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity search without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons even though a court had ordered his release. \n58.  Plaintiff Barnes has suffered damages as a result. \n \n  15\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 16 of 25\nPlaintiff David Peterson’s Strip Search \n59.  On 2/21/06 Plaintiff David Peterson was again taken to the Superior \nCourt and the Superior Court judge ordered his immediate release. \n60.  On 2/21/06 Plaintiff David Peterson was diverted to the holding \nfacility at DC General because the judge in his case had previously ordered that he \nbe released on 2/20/06 and again on 2/21/06 ordered his release.  \n61.   Plaintiff David Peterson was entitled to release on 2/20/05. \n62.  But, instead of being released from the holding facility at DC General \non 2/21/06, Plaintiff David Peterson was returned to the DC Jail’s general \npopulation and subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity search without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons even though a court had ordered his release. \n63.  Plaintiff Peterson has suffered damages as a result. \nPlaintiff Maurice Williams \n64.  Plaintiff Maurice Williams is currently held in the DC Jail on a show \ncause order for probation violation issued by a District of Columbia Superior \nCourt, who has a hearing scheduled for 2/27/06, at which he is likely to be \nreleased, and after which he is likely to be overdetained and subjected to an illegal \ncourt return strip search. \n \n  16\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 17 of 25\nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nCount 1 \n§ 1983 Deliberate Indifference Liability of the District for the Constitutional \nViolations of its Employees \n65.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nreallege and incorporate by reference all allegations set forth in the preceding \nparagraphs of this Complaint. \n66.  District of Columbia administrators, policy makers, supervisors and \nemployees caused the intentional, unjustified overdetention of the Overdetained \nNamed Plaintiffs and unreasonable strip searches of the Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members and Strip Search Class members by \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional injury of overdetention in \nadministering records relating to inmates’ detention and release, and maintaining \nand acquiescing in a policy and practice of strip searching certain inmates. \n67.  Overdetaining any person violates that person’s Fourth and Fifth and \nEighth Amendment rights. \n68.  Unreasonably strip searching an inmate violates his Fourth and Fifth \nAmendment rights. \n \n  17\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 18 of 25\n69.  District of Columbia employees continue in such conduct up to and \nincluding the present. \n70.  At all relevant times such District of Columbia employees were acting \nwithin the scope of their employment, their acts were motivated by a desire to \nfurther the interests of the District of Columbia, and such District of Columbia \nemployees were acting in furtherance of the business of the District of Columbia. \n71.  The District is therefore liable by virtue of its deliberate indifference \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for constitutional injuries to the Overdetained Named \nPlaintiffs and Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class members and Strip \nSearch Class members caused by the conduct of such employees. \n72.  Accordingly, all Named Plaintiffs are entitled to damages to be \ndetermined at trial, and the Overdetention and Strip Search Classes are entitled to \ninjunctive relief. \n \n  18\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 19 of 25\nCount 2  \n§ 1983 Monell Custom and Practice Direct Liability of District of Columbia for \nViolation of Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendment Rights of Overdetained Named \nPlaintiffs and Class Members \n73.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth in this Complaint. \n74.  Beginning approximately in late December 2005, the District of \nColumbia, and its agents and employees, have had a custom of detaining people \npast their release dates, thereby causing the intentional, unjustified overdetention \nof the Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and all other class members. \n75.  The District's actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly \nand proximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of \nthe Overdetained Named Plaintiffs and all other class members’ Fourth, Fifth and \nEighth Amendment rights. \n76.  Accordingly, all Named Plaintiffs are entitled to damages to be \ndetermined at trial, and the Overdetention Class is entitled to injunctive relief. \nCount 3 \n \n  19\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00315-RCL   Document 1   Filed 02/23/06   Page 20 of 25\n§ 1983 Monell Custom and Practice Direct Liability of District of Columbia for \nViolation of Fourth and Fifth Amendment Rights of Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nand Strip Search Class Members for Illegal Strip Searches \n77.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth in this Complaint. \n78.  The District's actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly \nand proximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of \nthe Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and the Strip Search Class members’ Fourth and \nFifth Amendment rights.   \n79.
