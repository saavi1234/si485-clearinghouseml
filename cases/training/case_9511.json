    "summary": "<p>On December 24, 2004, private civil rights attorneys and attorneys for the Youth Law Center, Inc. the Children's Law Center, Inc, and the Ohio Justice &amp; Policy Center filed a &sect; 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, challenging the treatment of juveniles in the custody or under the supervision of the Ohio Department of Youth Services (ODYS). The ODYS operated juvenile correctional institutions in Ohio which included Circleville Youth Center, Cuyahoga Hills Boys School, Indian River School, Marion Juvenile Correctional Center, Mohican Youth Center, Ohio River Valley Youth Center, Scioto Juvenile Correctional Center, and the Freedom Center.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that the individually named plaintiffs and the plaintiff class members were subjected to abusive, inhumane, and illegal conditions, policies, and practices, which included: excessive force, physical abuse, unreasonable mechanical restraints, lockdown and isolation for arbitrary reasons, improper strip searches, inadequate mental health care and medical treatment, inadequate education services and programs, and ineffective disciplinary measures. Plaintiffs further alleged that the ODYS denied equal access and services for girls in its custody. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs amended the complaint on June 15, 2005. Defendants moved to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>On July 29, 2005, the District Court (Magistrate Judge Terence P. Kemp) stayed the case at the request of the parties so that they could pursue settlement negotiations. The Court denied plaintiffs' request for class certification without prejudice to refiling and administratively closed the case.</p>\r\n<p>On April 4, 2007, plaintiffs requested that the court ordered stay be lifted and that they be granted leave to file a second amended complaint. Judge Kemp granted this motion and the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification on July 9, 2007. The court defined the class as:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>[a]ll persons who are or who will be committed to the legal custody of the Department of Youth Services (DYS) and housed in one of its facilities at Circleville Juvenile Correctional Facility, Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile Correctional Facility, Freedom Center, Indian River Juvenile Correctional Facility, Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility, Mohican Juvenile Correctional Facility, Ohio River Valley Juvenile Correctional Facility, Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility, or housed in the private facility the Lighthouse Youth Center, Paint Creek (collectively the DYS facilities).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>On May 18, 2007, United States Magistrate Judge Kemp appointed Fred Cohen as Independent Fact Finder. Cohen assembled a team of 10 experts with whom he conducted intensive site visits of various Ohio Department of Youth Services (ODYS) facilities. The team interviewed staff, youth and ODYS officials and reviewed numerous records and reports. On December 13, 2007, Cohen issued a 214 page Fact-Finding Final Report, which addressed his team's findings and its recommendations for an overhaul of the ODYS system and facilities.</p>\r\n<p>On May 21, 2008, the court approved a settlement in the case. Under the terms of the agreement, the defendants agreed to a comprehensive continuum of care in a regionalized services delivery system, a system of monitoring, youth-focused care, quality treatment interventions, engagement of families, education and vocational training of youths in the system, a grievance system, access to advocates/attorneys, strong re-entry programs, and a fair and effective release process.</p>\r\n<p>Less than a week before the settlement was approved, the Department of Justice filed its own suit in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/10900/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States v. Strickland</a></em>. That case was soon settled, and compliance work on the two continued together. On April 7, 2012, the issue of attorney fees and expenses was decided, with the court ordering defendants to pay $113,086.00.&nbsp;On Feb. 11, 2015, the monitoring Correctional Institution Inspection Committee issued a report showing a dramatic decline in use of seclusion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As a result of the Department of Youth Services&rsquo; compliance with the consent decree, all parties agreed that the case should be closed. Judge Algenon L. Marbley granted the joint motion to terminate the consent decree on December 9, 2015.</p>",

MARBLEY \nDefendants.  ) \nAGREED ORDER \nOn February 18, 2014, Plaintiffs in S.H v. Reed filed a motion for specific performance \n(Doc 389), and alleged a failure \"to provide adequate treatment to youth who are or have been on \nthe mental health caseload.  As a result many of these youth are experiencing excessive periods \nof seclusion ....\"   Id at p. 1.  On March 12, 2014, the United States filed a motion for a \ntemporary restraining order in United States v. Ohio raising concerns about Defendants' use of \nseclusion for all youth with an identified mental health disorder.  (Doc 131 ).  The United States \nalso filed a supplemental complaint.  (Doc 140). \nShortly thereafter, the parties engaged in settlement negotiations aimed at addressing the \nissues raised in those filings.  The Court hereby consolidates these actions under Fed R. Civ. \nProc. 42.  They shall retain their separate status but be consolidated for the purpose of case \n--- ---- ------\n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 401 Filed: 05/21/14 Page: 2 of 6  PAGEID #: 12855\nmanagement and monitoring.  The terms of this Order are intended to be implemented consistent \nwith Docs 108 and 359 in S.H v. Reed and with Doc 85 in United States v. Ohio. \nAttached as Exhibit A to this Order is the agreed grid that details the actions Defendants \nwill undertake to improve mental health services and reduce seclusion of youth who are on the \nmental health caseload.  The actions and deadlines included in the attached grid are hereby \nincorporated into this Order.  Defendants' compliance with those terms will be co-monitored by \nMr. Will Harrell and Dr. Kelly Dedel under the Court's jurisdiction, and monitoring will \ncontinue until Defendants have maintained substantial compliance with all provisions and \nperformance measures for six months. \nUpon entry of this Order, Plaintiffs in S.H v. Reed agree to withdraw their pending \nmotions (Docs 389 and 390) without prejudice.  The United States agrees to withdraw without \nprejudice its renewed motion for a temporary restraining order.  (Doc 145).  Because Defendants \nhave committed to the eventual elimination of disciplinary seclusion for all youth housed in a \nDYS facility and to engage with the monitors and subject matter experts within six months \nhereof to formulate steps to reach that goal, the United States also agrees to withdraw without \nprejudice the claims in its supplemental complaint concerning youth who are not on the mental \nhealth caseload.  (Doc 140).  The United States agrees that it may not renew those claims until \none month after the effective date of a request that this Court conduct a conference with the \nUnited States and the Defendants regarding a resolution of the United States' claims and that the \neffective date for a conference request shall be no sooner than seven months from the date of this \nOrder. \nOn a quarterly basis starting July 31, 2014, DYS will provide AMS reports for youth not \non the MHCL, but who were held in seclusion for an act of violence, that will contain a narrative \n2 \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 401 Filed: 05/21/14 Page: 3 of 6  PAGEID #: 12856\nof the incident resulting in seclusion, the AMS number, the date and time the youth went into \nseclusion and the date and time the youth was released from seclusion, the date the youth entered \nDYS, the date the youth was released from DYS (if youth has been released) and the type of \nseclusion.  On July 31, 2014, DYS shall send the monitors such documents from May 1, 2014 to \nJuly 30, 2014.  These documents will be provided quarterly until DYS reaches substantial \ncompliance with regard to seclusion, or the lawsuit terminates, whichever occurs first.  The \nmonitors may share this information with counsel for the United States and S.H Plaintiffs. \nThe following areas are hereby removed from monitoring: psychotropic medication, \nsufficiency of psychiatric resources, and equitable treatment.  The remaining areas of monitoring \n(QA/QI and peer review for mental health and psychiatry, case formulation, fidelity of treatment \nprovided to treatment model, treatment planning and treatment teams, behavior contracts, suicide \nprevention, and discipline for youth on the mental health caseload through the intervention \nhearing process) are addressed by the grid and will be monitored in accordance therewith. \nThis Order is necessary to address and redress ongoing constitutional violations already \nfound, and the relief set forth herein is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary, and is \nthe least intrusive means to do so.  Defendants may seek to terminate this Order no earlier than \nJuly 15, 2015 at which time the S.H Plaintiffs and United States shall bear the burden of proof to \ndemonstrate the existence of an ongoing violation of federal law and that the current order \nreflects narrowly drawn relief which extends no further than necessary and is the least intrusive \nmeans to remedy that violation. \nIT IS SO STIPULATED AND AGREED FOR S.H.

(Doc. 410.)  The Court-appointed monitors, Will Harrell and Kelly Dedel (“the \nMonitors”), have submitted final reports on the Department of Youth Services’ (“DYS”) \nfacilities for boys and DYS-contracted facilities for girls, finding DYS in substantial compliance \nwith the remaining quality assurance measures under monitoring.  All parties now agree that this \ncase should be terminated.  The Monitors have also submitted a final report entitled “The Ohio \nModel: A Report on the Transformation of the Ohio Department of Youth Services, 2007-2015,” \nwhich details the remarkable improvement in conditions of confinement in DYS juvenile \n1 \n \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 413 Filed: 12/09/15 Page: 2 of 5  PAGEID #: 12996\nfacilities over the last seven years.  They hope to use this report in part to “memorialize the \nagency’s major policy and practice decisions for the benefit of others in the field.”  (Doc. 411.)  \nThe Court will briefly summarize the history of the litigation and highlight some of the \nremarkable improvements at DYS facilities since this case began. \nI.  HISTORY OF THIS LITIGATION \nOn December 20, 2004, Plaintiffs in S.H. v. Reed, No. 2:04-cv-1206, filed a complaint \nchallenging conditions at DYS juvenile correctional facilities.  The Court later entered an order \ncertifying the S.H. case as a class action.  (Doc. 67.)  The S.H. plaintiffs challenged the \napplication by staff of unnecessary force; arbitrary and excessive use of isolation and seclusion, \narbitrary and excessive discipline; inadequate mental health, medical, and dental care; inadequate \neducational services; inadequate structured programming; broadly inadequate training of staff; an \nunsafe living environment; and a dysfunctional grievance system.  (Doc. 76 at 6.)  On May 16, \n2008, the United States filed a similar complaint in the companion case United States v. Ohio, \nNo. 2:08-cv-475.  On May 18, 2007, the Court approved a case management plan under which \nthe parties agreed to a joint fact finding team, and that team’s report was filed on December 31, \n2007.  On May 21, 2008, the parties agreed to a Stipulation of Injunctive Relief which \nincorporated that Report and established that the conditions of confinement for youth in DYS \nfacilities violated the constitutional and statutory rights of those youth.  (Doc. 108.)  The \nStipulation provided for a period of oversight by a Court-appointed monitor for five years.  (Id. \nat 87.) \nOn February 18, 2014, the S.H. Plaintiffs filed a motion for specific performance and \nalleged a failure to provide adequate treatment to youth who are or have been on the mental \nhealth caseload, in particular faulting the excessive periods of seclusion to which these youth \n2 \n \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 413 Filed: 12/09/15 Page: 3 of 5  PAGEID #: 12997\nwere subjected.  The United States also filed a supplemental complaint renewing its motion for a \ntemporary restraining order.  Through settlement negotiations, the parties reached an agreement \non the resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims, which the Court approved.  (Doc. 401.)   \nThis settlement established a Grid that detailed the actions Defendants committed to \nundertake to improve mental health services and reduce seclusion of youth on the mental health \ncaseload.  (Doc. 401-1.)  The remaining areas to be monitored included quality assurance and \npeer review for mental health and psychiatry, case formulation, fidelity of treatment provided to \ntreatment model, treatment planning and treatment terms, behavior contracts, suicide prevention, \nand discipline for youth on the mental health caseload through the intervention hearing process.  \n(Doc. 400 at 3.)  Starting on July 31, 2014, DYS agreed to provide to the Monitors quarterly \nreports on its seclusion practices. The parties agreed that Defendants’ compliance with the Grid \nwould be monitored by Mr. Harrell and Dr. Dedel until DYS maintained substantial compliance \nwith all provisions and performance measures for six months.  Although the order indicated that \nthe Grid applies only to youth at facilities directly managed by DYS, it also specified that “youth \nat other facilities shall receive mental health services consistent with those described [in the \nGrid] but appropriately tailored for such non-DYS managed facilities.”  (Doc. 401-1 at 9.)  These \nother facilities include the contracted facilities which house girls. \nII.  CURRENT CONDITIONS AT DYS FACILITIES \nIn June 2015, the Monitors filed a Compliance Report for the DYS boys’ facilities \n(“Boys Report”).  (Doc. 407.)  In November 2015, the Monitors also filed a review of the DYS \ncontracted programs for girls (“Girls Report”).  The Boys Report, and the memos that followed it \nin August 2015, concluded that DYS is now in substantial compliance with all of the provisions \nand performance measures incorporated in the Grid.  The Girls Report concluded that the \n3 \n \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 413 Filed: 12/09/15 Page: 4 of 5  PAGEID #: 12998\npractices at the contracted girls’ facilities were functionally equivalent to services prescribed by \nthe Grid for boys at DYS facilities, including significant progress in quality of treatment and \nfurther restrictions on the use of seclusion. The improvements documented by the Ohio Model \nReport include the following: \n  The video recording and review of all applications of the use of force, and intensive staff \ntraining and oversight for compliance with the use-of-force policy \n \n  A meaningful grievance system and easy access to attorneys to address concerns related \nto fact, duration, and conditions of confinement \n \n  Abolition of the practice of disciplinary seclusion and dramatic reductions in pre-hearing \nseclusion \n \n  Fully staffed and well-managed educational programming and the elimination of school \nsuspensions and school-day reductions \n \n  Improved systems for health assessments, physical exams, maintenance of medical \nrecords, and more thorough documentation, as well as chronic care and medication \nadministration that is now consistent with national guidelines \n \n  New Program Administrator positions at each facility; expanded access to work programs \n(for high school graduates); Youth Councils that offer youth a meaningful role in \ndecision-making; positive behavior incentive programs for youth; cognitive behavioral \ntherapy program to target youth at risk of reoffending or gang involvement \n \n  Video conferencing technology and bus transportation to increase family visitation and a \npolicy of seven-day-a-week visitation \n \n  Vastly improved mental health treatment including group treatment sessions; quality \noversight of staff; easy accessibility of treatment professionals; and the replacement of \npunitive Special Management Plans that relied excessively on seclusion with Behavior \nContracts, tailored plans with incentives and consequences \n \n  Development of standardized criteria to deny a youth’s release rather than making such \ndecisions without any criteria, as well as a meaningful process to appeal a release denial \n \n  Reducing the incarcerated population from over 2000 youth several years ago to less than \n500 today through the initiative RECLAIM, whereby DYS partnered with juvenile courts \nthroughout the state to increase their capacity effectively to supervise and serve youth at \nthe county level, which has led to less school interruption, more family engagement, and \nbetter behavioral outcomes for youth. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 413 Filed: 12/09/15 Page: 5 of 5  PAGEID #: 12999\nIII.  CONCLUSION \n \nThe Court concludes that the Defendants have complied with the terms and modifications \nof the Stipulation for Injunctive Relief in Case No. 2:04-cv-1206 and the consent decree in Case \nNo. 2:08-cv-475.  The Joint Motion to Terminate the Consent Decree is GRANTED.  The \nconsent decree is hereby TERMINATED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n                    s/ Algenon L.

Stickrath, 2:04-cv-01206. In this case,  \n \nPlaintiffs allege a system-wide failure regarding conditions \nof confinement within facilities operated by DYS that \nendanger Plaintiffs’ physical health and safety; threaten \nPlaintiffs’ emotional and psychological well-being; deprive \nPlaintiffs of adequate programming, education, medical and \nmental health care, and dental care; and deprive Plaintiffs \nof due process of law.  \n \nThe purpose of the site visit to Ohio River Valley Juvenile \nCorrectional Facility, ORVJCF, on February 11 and 12, 2009, \nwas primarily to ascertain data regarding the conditions of \nconfinement for youth on the Special Management Unit, SMU. \nThere are concerns that the level of mental health care \navailable to Caucasian youth with acute mental illness is \nnot available to African American youth, and to youth that \nallegedly have engaged in gang-related behavior at some \npoint during their DYS commitments. Allegedly, these youths \nsystematically are denied transfers to the MHU when the MHU \nis the designated setting for youths with acute serious \nmental illness. \n \nAlso, there are concerns that criteria by which youth are \nadmitted to the SMU, which include the results of an \n“arbitrary” rating tool do not comport with the evidence \nbased level of scrutiny articulated in the Stipulation \nAgreement. \n \nAdditionally, there are concerns that the DYS Release \nAuthority is being excessively punitive, by adding \nadditional commitment time to the DYS commitments of \nmentally ill youth when their disruptive behavior may be \nrelated to DYS’ failure to provide minimally acceptable \nmental health treatment to these youth. \n           \nQualifications of Evaluator \nThe qualifications of this examiner were submitted for \nreview in the past. A copy of these qualifications will be \nmade available on request. \n \n \n \n  3\n\nSK. v.

As such, \ncomments and observations will be made regarding the \nconditions in the SMU and in the MHU, which offers a higher \nlevel of mental health care to youth committed to DYS. \n \nLimitations of Evaluation \nThe evaluation was based on information made available to \nme during my visit to ORVJCF.

The \nLiberations Building contains five living units, including \nMcKinley - the Mental Health Unit or MHU, and Grant, the \nhome of the Special Management Unit, SMU.  \n \nOn January 19, 2009, the census at ORVJCF was 267. The \naverage youth age is seventeen years, however youth as \nyoung as thirteen or fourteen, and as old as twenty also \nare at the facility.  \n \nThere were 58(21.7%) Caucasian youth and 209(78.3%) non \nCaucasian youth. There were thirteen youth assigned to the \nMcKinley Mental Health Unit: one is biracial, two are \nAfrican American, and ten (76.9%)are Caucasian. There were \nnineteen youth assigned to the Grant Special Management \nUnit: three (15.8%) are Caucasian, fourteen are African \nAmerican, and two are biracial. There were 117 youth \nassigned to the Mental Health Caseload; 36 (30.8%) are \nCaucasian. These statistics suggest that Caucasian at ORV \nyouth have disproportionately more mental illness and more \nserious mental illness than do African American youth. On \nthe other hand, these numbers also could suggest that ORV \nbehavioral health team members and administration are less \nskilled and/or comfortable with evaluating African American \nyouth for the presence of psychiatric disorders, including \nengaging them and understanding how culture and history, \nincluding a youth’s developmental history, may influence \nthe presentation of mental illness in different racial and \nethnic groups. Given the exposure rate of African American \nyouth to community base violence and trauma, a reasonable \nperson in like circumstances may conclude that African \nAmerican youth are not receiving adequate screening for \npsychiatric disorders. \n \nStatistical Data \nThe Mental Health Precautionary Status Statistical Summary \ncontains data for November 1, 2008 through February 12, \n2009. During that timeframe: \n  5\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \no  Seventeen youth on the Residential Mental Health Unit \nand 26 youth assigned to general population units were \nassigned to precautionary status. \no  Five youth were placed on Suicide Watch; one remained \non watch for five days and all other youth were \nremoved from Suicide Watch after one day. \no  Thirteen youth were on Behavior Status on the \nResidential Mental Health Unit and twenty were \nassigned to general population units. \n \nStaff and Unions \nAll ORVJCF behavioral health team members belong to a union \nexcept the psychiatrist, the social work supervisor, and \nthe psychology supervisor. When facilities close or layoffs \noccur, the bumping process may displace well-trained staff \nthat know and work well with youth. This practice alters \nthe quality of mental health services and behavioral \ninterventions available to youth throughout ORVJCF. \n \nNew behavioral health and direct care staff must complete \nrequired training in 90 days to remain in their new \npositions. During the orientation period, new staff members \ndo not receive additional monitoring, mentoring or \nsupervision. Youth are subjected to the inexperience of new \nstaff members without much recourse. Staff inexperience is \nconducive to disruptive youth behavior and may deprive \nyouth of a minimally acceptable level of care, especially \nwhen there is frequent staff turnover, as may occur when \nother juvenile corrections facilities close and established \nbehavioral staff are reassigned or lose their jobs. \n \nAt this point, behavioral health and direct care staff \nassigned to the SMU and MHU do not have special job \nclassifications. Although this process may be complicated, \nassigning special classification status to these positions \nwould enhance the stability of the SMU and MHU programs and \nwould require candidates that wish to work in those areas \nto complete special training before they bid for positions. \nThis process would likely deter less interested and less \ncommitted staff from seeking these positions. On the other \nhand, this practice would complicate the process of filling \npositions when staff shortages exist. \n \nIn the past, ORVJCF has relied heavily on relief staff due \nto staffing deficits. The staff shortage made it difficult \nto cross train employees for different positions. The staff \n  6\n\nSK. v.

A less costly \nalternative may be used in the future, if it is deemed to \nmeet youth rehabilitative needs. \n \nProtective Custody \nYouth that need protective custody have been housed on the \nSpecial Management Unit and on the Mental Health Unit \ndepending on the needs of the youth. Some youth engage in \ndisruptive behavior so they may be removed from threatening \nsituations in the general population. These youth are less \nlikely to buy into and complete the SMU Behavior Management \nProgram and/or the MHU program, because they do not want to \nreturn to the general population. The grievance system, \nwhich staff and youth have said is ineffective, does not \noffer a viable venue for youth to address many of their \nsafety concerns. \n \nBehavioral Health \n  Psychology \n    The ORVJCF Psychology Department consists of a \nPsychology Supervisor, a doctoral level Psychologist, three \nPsychology Assistant II staff, and a Psychology Assistant \nI. The Psychologist was recently assigned to the SMU full-\ntime to develop the SMU rehabilitation program. The ORVJCF \nPsychology supervisor said that psychologists presently run \nsleep hygiene groups for youth in the general population \nand an anger management group for youth in the SMU. Groups \nare supposed to meet at least twice weekly.  \n   \n  Psychiatry \n    ORV contracts for 25 -30 psychiatry hours per \nweek. The ORVJCF psychiatrist is board certified in general \npsychiatry and has an interest in forensic psychiatry. He \nprovided psychiatric consultation to the Ohio Department of \nRehabilitation and Corrections for about ten years before \nhe began to consult to ORVJCF. He spent additional time, \nduring his residency training, treating adolescents; he \nsaid he feels comfortable working with the ORVJCF youth \npopulation.  \n \nDespite these strengths, the ORVJCF psychiatrist does not \nhave access to a DYS administrative child psychiatrist for \n  7\n\nSK. v.

Also, \nthe ORVJCF psychiatrist has not taken a vacation since he \narrived at ORVJCF more than one year ago. Additionally, he \nworks Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays; he does not meet \nor exceed the maximum number of contract hours. Clinic \noffice space limitations make it difficult for the \npsychiatrist to work on other weekdays. He is available by \nphone 24 hours per day. \n \nGang-related concerns and interventions, including facility \nlockdowns, may extend the workday for the psychiatrist, who \nevaluates four to six new youth weekly. Medication \ncompliance numbers are tallied weekly, for each prescribed \nmedication, so that the psychiatrist may address adherence \nconcerns with youth that in a timely manner. \n \nThere are safeguards in place that increase the likelihood \nthat youth have consistent psychiatric follow-up. The \npsychiatrist documents when he wishes to follow up with a \nyouth and writes medication orders that last thirty days. \nNursing staff alerts the psychiatrist if a medication order \nis about to expire and has not been renewed. Youth usually \nare evaluated before medications are renewed. \n \nThe psychiatrist makes an effort to contact parents to \nobtain additional history and to review medication \ntreatment plans with them. Youth rarely meet with the \npsychiatrist more than once per month even when they are \ninitiating new medication trials. \n     \n  Social Work \n    DYS social workers historically were not part of \nthe behavioral health team. They recently were granted \naccess to behavioral health progress notes and they do not \ndocument in the “psychology charts.” Thus, their \ninteractions with youth are reviewed by behavioral health \nstaff and others during treatment team meetings. According \nto DYS Central Office administrators, efforts to integrate \nsocial workers into the behavioral health team have been \nslow due to unions, state licensure regulations and other \nadministrative and bureaucratic obstacles. \n \nEducation \nBriefly, a school psychologist (0.5 FTE) who conducts \npsychoeducational testing for youth in need of education \nremedies, such as 504 plans, and related services.

Several youth said they have given up on writing \ngrievances because grievance officers “never answer them.” \nStaff said youth that write too many grievances “can end up \nin the SMU because staff say they [youths] don’t fit in,” \neven if their grievances are valid. \n \nCrisis Intervention and Suicidal Youth \nPsychology team members said that when a youth is at risk \nfor self harm, the youth is placed in “direct sight” of a \njuvenile corrections officer until a member of the \npsychology team arrives to conduct the assessment. \nPsychologists are expected to respond within four minutes \nafter they are contacted. Psychology assistants must \nconsult with a supervisor before the youth’s level of \nmonitoring is adjusted.  \n \nYouth placed on suicide precaution plans have their \nprogress reviewed daily by behavioral health team members. \nThe psychiatrist may remove a youth from suicide \nprecautions unless a psychologist is not available and the \nfacility superintendent approves this intervention. This \npractice marginalizes the role of psychiatry in DYS and \nfalls below the community standard of care. \n \n \nThe Mental Health Unit \nOn the first day of the survey, the census for McKinley, \nthe mental health unit, was thirteen. The unit can \naccommodate 20 youth. \n \nAccording to the Residential Mental Health Unit Plan, \ncriteria for admission to the McKinley MHU are: \n \n1.  Increased risk for danger to self. \n2.  Increased risk for danger to others \n3.  Presence of acute psychiatric symptoms “that can \nbe more efficiently and effectively treated in a \nsmall unit setting with aggressive psychiatric \ntreatment and support.” \n4.  Difficulty maintaining stability in the general \npopulation due to a youth’s deteriorating \nadaptive and/or interpersonal skills. \n  9\n\nSK. v.

Also, a total of eight juvenile corrections \nofficers, JCOs, are assigned to work on the unit. The unit \npresently does not have a general activity therapist. The \npsychiatrist is not mentioned in the Unit Plan, but \nprovides consultation to youth on the Mental Health Unit. \nThe psychiatrist has no defined role or leadership \nexpectations on the Mental Health Unit; he does not attend \ntreatment team meetings and does not direct the care of \nyouth with acute serious mental illness. This DYS practice \ndeviates substantially from the community standard. \n \nMHU interdisciplinary team meetings occur weekly and youth \nprogress is reviewed monthly, or more frequently, if \nindicated. The treatment team consists of the unit manager, \nsocial worker, psychologist/psychology assistant, education \nrepresentative and general activity therapist. Each youth \nis expected to participate in his treatment team meetings. \nYouth receive individual and group therapy as needed; no \nminimum frequency is specified.  \n \nStaff assigned to mental health units must participate in \ntraining on diagnosing mental disorders, psychotropic \nmedication, Trauma-Informed Care, evidence based treatment \ninterventions, violence against others, suicidality and \nviolence against self, precautionary status interventions, \nEmergency Response, cognitive behavioral treatment theory, \nthe “Thinking for Change” program, and Advanced Verbal \nStrategies. \n \nMHU team members are supposed to meet monthly to exchange \n“experiences, insights, and new knowledge.” These problem \nsolving meetings should help staff enhance their skills and \nimprove interdisciplinary communication. Team members must \nalso attend annual in-service training. Additionally, staff \nmay propose additional training opportunities to the Unit \nManager at any time. \n \n  10\n\nSK. v.

The Director of Behavioral Health \nServices has been accessing and modifying public access \nmaterials from juvenile corrections programs in other \nstates that have more established programs. She also has \nbeen purchasing books and other materials for the unit. The \ntransition of this program from concept to reality has been \nturbulent, at best, in view of budgetary, administrative, \nand staffing limitations. Yet, the process is moving \nforward. \n \nThe Special Management Unit \nBy all accounts, the SMU is designed for youths that \nendanger the general population by engaging in violent \nbehavior. Staff said the youths assigned to the SMU \n“exhibit more criminal thinking” than youth on the MHU. \nMany youth that are on the SMU have engaged in gang \nactivity during their DYS commitments.  \n \nDocuments suggest that any youth that has engaged in \naggressive or disruptive behavior may be admitted to the \nSMU. A youth may be transferred to the SMU for up to three \ndays before a mandatory administrative review must occur. \n \nMHU, SMU, and general population staff unanimously reported \nthat mentally ill youth and youth with physical, cognitive, \nor medical vulnerabilities are not eligible for SMU \nplacement. They also stated that youth that have engaged in \nSTG activity, at any point during their DYS commitment, are \nnot eligible to be transferred to the MHU. Also, MHU staff \nare not in a position to override decisions about \ntransferring youth from the MHU to the SMU even when the \nproposed intervention is deemed to be therapeutic, is in \nthe interest of the MHU for safety purposes, and is in the \nyouth’s best therapeutic interests.  \n \nStaff reported that in recent weeks, the SMU has become \nmore therapeutic; an incentive-based program has been put \ninto place. The current SMU Unit Manager is viewed \nfavorably by SMU and MHU staff. He is easy to work with and \nwants youth to succeed. Time restrictions and scheduling \nconflicts precluded a face to face interview with the SMU \nUnit Manager. \n \n  11\n\nSK. v.

The SMU Admission Tool Guidelines form \nindicates: \n \nScores on the Admission Screening Tool have been \nstatistically evaluated. The following results were \npresent: \n    Average Score      45 \n    Score Range       28 -71 \n    Standard Deviation    12 \n    68% Average Score Range  33-57 \n \nYouth that score 46 or greater on the SMU Admission Tool \nare eligible to remain on the SMU for rehabilitative \nprogramming; youth with scores below 46 remain in the \ngeneral population. A treatment team may craft an \nindividualized or STG Special Management Program for any \nyouth in the general population. \n \nAlthough some areas of inquiry included in the SMU \nAdmission Tool have been associated with increases in youth \nviolence, the SMU Admission Screening Tool does not specify \nthe characteristics of the population that was used for the \nstatistical evaluation or how the scoring numbers were \nderived. It is unlikely that the SMU Admission Tool scores \nwere standardized on a population of incarcerated mentally \n  12\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nill youth. Yet, this is a population on which the SMU \nAdmission Screening tool is frequently used.  \n \nThe average score on the SMU Admission Screening tool is 45 \nwith a standard deviation of 12. The minimum score for \nadmission to the SMU is 46. This means that any youth that \nscores in the higher half, 51st percentile or greater, of \nthe scoring range, or one out of two youth is eligible to \nbe admitted to the SMU. Thus, most youth that are eligible \nfor SMU admission are functioning within the average range \nof behavior for the normed population.  This suggests that \nadmissions criteria for the SMU are excessively punitive \nand therapeutic alternatives for disruptive youth are not \nbeing considered by DYS and ORVJCF administrators.   \n \nAdditionally, inadequately treated mental illness, such as \npsychosis, increases the likelihood that a person will \nengage in violent behavior. Behavioral health team members \nthat are not properly trained to evaluate and treat \nmentally ill youth are indirectly contributing to violence \nin the ORVJCF and DYS communities. Despite this concern, \nyouth that engage in repeated acts of aggression have had \ntheir DYS commitments extended by months, if not years. \nPunishing youth for inadequate staff training and \ncompetence comports with cruel and unusual punishment of \nmentally ill juvenile offenders.  \n \nIn sum, the SMU Admission Tool does not comport with the \nevidence based requirements articulated in the SH.V. \nStickrath Stipulation Agreement. \n \nThere are special management plans for youth that have \nengaged in STG, activity, including gang fights, gang \ninitiations, singing gang-related songs, acknowledging \nmembership in a gang, making gang-related statements, using \ngang signals or using gang-related graffiti. These actions \ntake precedent when juvenile corrections officers classify \ndisruptive behavior for incident reporting. For example, a \nyouth that was locked in his room “began kicking his door \nrepeatedly and threatened to break off a sprinkler head. He \nalso sang gang related songs and admitted to being” a gang \nmember. His behavior was classified as “Gang Related \nIssues” and “Disruptive Behavior,” in that order. The youth \nwas placed on a STG behavior modification plan.   \n \nORVJCF staff unanimously reported that youth with STG \naffiliation are not eligible to be transferred to the MHU \n  13\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nfor care. Thus, mentally ill youth that have a history of \nSTG related activity are denied the same level of care \nafforded to youth without this classification. A DYS \nCentral Office administrator said this is not the case; \nyouth are assigned to the MHU based on the presence of \nvulnerability due to acute mental illness, medical, \nphysical, and/or cognitive disability.  \n \nYouth with acute mental illness that are physically \naggressive and may place youth on the MHU at risk for harm \nare assigned to the SMU or for care in the interest of \ncommunity safety. The mental health programs on the MHU and \nSMU differ substantially. Consequently, aggressive youth \nwith acute mental illness do not receive the same level of \ncare as youth assigned to the MHU.  \n \nThe DYS practice of depriving violent youth with acute \nmental illness will precipitously increase in significance \nafter Marion Juvenile Corrections Facility, MJCF, closes. \nORVJCF and DYS Central Office administrators unanimously \nstated that the MJCF youth, as a group, are more aggressive \nthan are youth currently housed at ORVJCF. Also, MJCF has a \nunit that serves youth with serious mental illness. Thus, \nMJCF youth with serious mental health concerns that are \ntransferred to ORVJCV may not be eligible to receive \nservices on the MHU because of past violent and/or gang-\nrelated behavior, even if the illness exacerbated the \nconcerning behaviors. Additionally, the closure of MJCF may \nresult in staff changes at ORVJCF due to union seniority \nand bumping practices. Thus, the SMU and MHU may, in the \nfuture, be less stable; they may have less experienced \nstaff that lack training and are unfamiliar with protocols, \npractices, and the target populations. \n \nSMU Special Management Plan \nThe SMU Special Management Plan was introduced as a six \nweek individualized behavior modification program, although \nyouth are permitted to work through the plan sooner and \nmany youth take longer than six weeks to work through the \nplan.

There is no dedicated group room on the SMU; staff   \nmust remove items from their desks and offices so youth \nwill not have access to contraband during group, \nindividual, and family therapy sessions. \n \nThe newer social worker conducts orientation sessions and \nassigns each youth to a “red phase” of the Special \nManagement Plan. Weekly individual treatment team meetings \nare attended by the youth, social worker, psychologist, and \nJCOs. When a youth has met his goals, he is advanced to the \n“yellow phase” of the program and begins to work with the \nmore experienced SMU social worker. The youth will advance \nfrom “yellow phase” to “blue phase” after he meets the \nrequirements for advancement.  \n \nThere is no orientation manual for the SMU. The orientation \nprocess is verbal. There was no documentation in the \npsychology chart, or elsewhere, regarding the SMU \norientation, treatment team meetings, individual sessions, \nor group sessions conducted by social workers. This may, in \npart, be due to roles and expectations for social workers \nthat are being redefined at the DYS Central Office level. \nThat is, social workers are not permitted to write in \npsychology charts. On the other hand, SMU social work staff \nmay be overwhelmed by the volume of work they do; they have \nnot had time to document their interactions with youth in \nany systematic fashion.  \n \nAlthough the role of the SMU Psychologist has not been \nclearly defined, he has begun to document anger management \ngroup sessions for each youth in his respective psychology \nchart. The social worker that sat in on the first anger \nmanagement group said the group is “promising.”  \n \nSocial workers have had to train themselves to run the SMU. \nThere is no curriculum, manual or training program.

They use the phones to \nconduct family sessions with youth. At times, involving \nfamily members has helped resistant youth modify their \nbehavior sooner. For example, youth that have exposed their \ngenitals to others often do not want their families to know \nabout their behavior. \n \nThere are concerns that with the closing of DYS facilities, \nthe existing staff on the SMU, MHU and elsewhere may be \n“bumped” from their positions in favor of staff with less \ninterest and experience and more seniority. Yet, there are \nno training manuals, training modules, or other resources \nto distribute to new SMU staff.  \n \nConstructive Suggestions from SMU Staff \nThe following suggestions were made by SMU staff that are \ninterested in introducing and maintaining a higher quality \nof care for youth. \n \n1.  A consistent budget is needed so that staff will \nhave access to necessary administrative, \nrehabilitative educational, training, supervisory, \nand clerical resources for the SMU. \n \n2.  Staff need consistent access to therapeutic \nmaterials. \n \n3.  Clerical support dedicated to the SMU is needed to \nfacilitate record keeping, parent contacts, \nmessages, etc. \n \n4.  Staff could benefit from having access to a copy \nmachine with scanner. The current process of \nobtaining copies and scanning in records is time \nconsuming and wastes valuable time that could be \nused for therapeutic interventions with youth. \n \n5.  SMU Staff need access to timely notes from the \npsychiatrist. Nothing appears in the psychology \nchart until the Monday following the psychiatry \nvisit. The typed notes from the psychiatrist are, \nhowever, “extremely helpful.” \n \n  17\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nWhen asked, staff agreed that regularly scheduled meetings \nwith the psychiatrist could benefit youth, and the program, \nby enhancing continuity of care, facilitating referrals, \nand promoting interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and \ninformation. \n \nMedication \nORVJCF medical staff reported that morning medications are \ndistributed at 6:30 AM.(Nursing shift change is at 7AM.) \nStaff on the BMU consistently reported that (contract) \nnurses distribute medication at 5AM. This creates problems \nfor youth that oversleep or do not want to awaken at 5AM to \nreceive medication. This practice also alters the \neffectiveness timeframe of stimulant and other medication \ndesigned to contain youth behavior throughout the school \nday.  \n \nIf a medication for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity \nDisorder, AD/HD, such as Adderall XR (long acting \ndexedrine) or Concerta (long acting methylphenidate/ \nRitalin) is given 90 minutes earlier than anticipated, the \nmedication effect will stop 90 minutes earlier during the \nschool day. Consequently, youth will be subjected to \nunnecessarily higher and more frequent medication dosages \nto contain their behavior.  \n \nClearly, the nursing practice of dosing medication at 5AM \nis not the least restrictive medication alternative for SMU \nyouth and is not cost effective. On the other hand, a 6:30 \nAM medication distribution time may not allow third shift \nnurses sufficient time to distribute medication and to \ncomplete required documentation before the 7:00 AM shift \nchange. Before I left the ORVJCF campus, DYS administrators \nassured me that the DYS Medical Director had been informed \nof this problem and “it has been addressed.” \n \nYouth records indicate that several youth have had their \noral stimulant medication discontinued after they have been \nfound with a stockpile of stimulant capsules in their \nrooms. This suggests that medication checks are not being \ngiven due diligence by nurses. Several interventions may \ndiminish the practice of youth hoarding and “cheeking” \nmedication, including: \n \n1.  Increased Staff Training and accountability \na. Frequent nurse in-service training should occur \nto review medication distribution practices, \n  18\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nincluding proper mouth checks. This is \nparticularly important because contract nurses, \nwho may be subject to higher turnover, \ndistribute medication to the youth. \nb. Nurses that do not correctly conduct mouth \nchecks should be held accountable after they \nhave completed the requisite training. \n \n2.  Greater use of dissolvable medication \na. The antidepressant mirtazapine (Remeron) is \ngeneric and has a dissolvable SolTab \nformulation that makes it difficult for youth \nto regurgitate it. Mirtazapine’s sedating \neffects may also be beneficial to youth \nstruggling with insomnia and may improve the \nappetites of youth receiving stimulants for \nAD/HD. Mirtazapine is FDA approved for \ntreatment of adults, so appropriate disclosures \nmust be documented when it is used with youth.  \n \nThe antipsychotic medication risperidone \n(Risperdal) also has a dissolvable M-Tab \nformulation. \n \nb. lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse) may be \ndissolved in water before it is issued to youth \nwith AD/HD. The medication is formulated to \nprevent recreational drug users from deriving a \n“high” from it. \n \nc. Dissolvable medications tend to taste better \nthan crushed medications because most \ndissolvable medication manufacturers factor \ntaste into the product development and \nmanufacturing processes. \n \n3.  Improved monitoring of youth \na. Monitoring youth closely for 30 minutes to one \nhour after they ingest medication to reduce the \nlikelihood that they may spit out the \nmedication. (This practice is more easily \naccomplished on a mental health unit.) \n \nb. Prohibiting youth from using the bathroom for \nthe first 30 minutes to one hour after they \ningest medication; youth may regurgitate \nmedication when they are not being watched \n  19\n\nSK. v.

(This practice is \nmore easily accomplished on a mental health \nunit.) \n \n4.  Crushing medication  \na. This practice should be limited to medications \nthat are not enteric coated.

This suggests the role of \npsychiatry is marginalized in the DYS System. The \npractice also provides an inaccurate clinical \npicture of each youth’s mental disorder(s). \n \no  Conduct Disorder diagnoses were listed in excess. \nConduct Disorder is the only psychiatric \ndiagnosis that may be made by any lay person. The \npractice of labeling mentally ill delinquent \nyouth with conduct disorder as their primary \nmental health disorder allows behavioral staff, \nincluding psychiatrists, to justify depriving \nchallenging youth of necessary behavioral health \ntreatment and interventions. This practice must \nstop. Youth need to be engaged by behavioral \nhealth practitioners, to have their diagnoses \nclarified and to receive evidence based \ninterventions for their disorders.

At ORVJCF, the psychiatrist places a handwritten \nnote in the youth’s medical chart after each contact. The \npsychiatrist also dictates a DYS note into a his personal \ndigital tape recorder. The psychiatrist brings the digital \ntape recorder to his home, where he transcribes each note \nusing his personal voice recognition software. He prints \nthe notes and brings them to ORVJCF the following Monday. \nDYS compensates the psychiatrist for transcription time. \nThere is no notation in each youth’s psychology chart \nregarding psychiatry contact until the Monday following the \nclinical contact. Thus, in an emergency situation, the \nbehavioral health crisis evaluator may not have access to \ninformation derived during the youth’s most recent \npsychiatry session. \n \nThe psychiatry notes contained information regarding family \ncontacts, therapeutic interventions, clinical decision \nmaking, bloodwork and each youth’s response to clinical \ninterventions. Notations regarding treatment team meetings \nwere noticably absent; the psychiatrist, by design, is not \nan active participant in SMU and MHU treatment team \nmeetings. \n \nThe following notes were absent from the MHU and SMU charts \nI reviewed: \no  Social work notes  \no  Individual therapy \no  Group therapy \no  Unit orientation \no  Family contact \no  Changes of priviliege level \no  Treatment team meeting \n \no  Psychology notes* \no  Group therapy** \no  Unit orientation \no  Family contact \no  Changes of priviliege level \n  21\n\nSK. v.

Most \nmedications listed comport with the community standard for \npsychiatric care in adolescents. There are a couple of \nconcerns: \n1. Three youth are prescribed doxepin (Sinequan), which \nis the most dangerous of all tricyclic \nantidepressants because it can change heart rhythms \nand can be fatal. Doxepin is often used in \ncorrections patients because it is inexpensive and is \neasily crushed. A baseline EKG is required before \ninitiating treatment with doxepin. Also, EKGs should \nbe ordered at three month intervals. However, this \nmedication is not commonly used to treat adolescents; \nsafer alternatives are available. \n \n2. The antiseizure medication levetiracetam (Keppra) \nalso is not commonly used to treat psychiatric \ndisorders in adolescents.

He has made toy guns, and has accessed \nother contraband. He is one of the most disruptive youth at \nORVJMS. Yet, he is sufficiently intelligent to stop short \nof generating an incident report and has rarely generated \nincident reports in recent months. \n \nTMC has a history of mood disorder, substance dependence, \nself injurious behavior, and disruptive behavior. In \nNovember 2008, letters containing STG content were found in \nhis room. These letters contained riot plans, including \nplans that described injuring staff and youth. MHU staff \nconcluded that because TMC has a leadership role on the \nMHU, a serious consequence must occur for his behavior. He \nwas transferred to the SMU for five days to address these \nproblems and the “placement was effective” according to DYS \nadministrators.  \n \nI was unable to ascertain how staff determined that five \ndays was the appropriate amount of time for TMC to spend on \nthe SMU, especially since other youth would have to spend \nsix weeks there for similar actions. MHU staff say they \nwanted TMC to remain on the SMU so he could complete the \nentire SMU rehabilitative program. This request was denied \n“because of his mental health issues.” DYS Central Office \nadministrators approved the five-day SMU transfer for TMC. \n \nASC \nYouth ASC had an extensive history of treatment at \ncommunity mental health facilities before he was remanded \nto DYS. He is impulsive, depressed, and has a working \ndiagnosis of bipolar or manic depressive disorder. He had \n100 days added to his DYS commitment because he \nparticipated in an STG fight. \n \nIn the past, ASC has flipped furniture, destroyed holiday \ndecorations, kicked doors, and threatened staff and youth. \nThe youth has engaged in self injurious behavior, including \ncutting his forearm with a piece of plastic. On August 19, \n2008, ten stimulant capsules were found in his room. He had \nbeen cheeking medication for AD/HD, possibly in an effort \nto use them recreationally.  \n \nDespite his emotional difficulties, ABC did not have \nfrequent psychological follow-up.

He had at least three fights per month \nwhen he initially arrived at DYS; he is well known to SMU \nstaff.  \n \nCSQ presently is assigned to the SMU because he fought in \nschool. He had had six months added to his DYS commitment \nbecause staff found a shank in his belongings. Records \nindicate that CYS is curious about “satanic worship.” CSQ \nhas received intermittent treatment for Attention \nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, AD/HD, and he recently has \nrefused medications. Despite the presence of a chronic \npsychiatric disorder, he intermittently has been on the \nmental health caseload during his stay. \n \nOn August 25, 2008, psychology staff removed CSQ from the \npsychology caseload. On September 4, 2008, psychology \nstaff(different person) says the youth has “legitimate \nfears.” More specifically, “He believes some of his anxiety \nis resulting from a trauma he experienced in the \ncommunity.” The youth is not evaluated by psychology staff \nagain until December 17, 2008, when he tells psychology \nstaff he does not want medication for AD/HD. During that \nsession, CSQ also reveals that when he was nine-years-old, \nhe was present when his friend was fatally shot. The youth \ncomplained of nightmares related to this trauma. (Note: \nThese symptoms are suggestive of posttraumatic stress \ndisorder or a mood disorder and warranted further \nexamination and follow-up.) \n \nOn December 17, 2008, the psychologist responds to CSQ’s \nconcerns by reviewing appropriate sleep hygiene with him \n(details were not specified in the note) and by removing \nCSQ from the psychology caseload.

Before he was \nremanded to the DYS, he had experienced severe physical \nabuse, was sexually abused and developed an addiction to \nrecreational substances. EMS’ mother and sister also have \nhad addiction and legal problems.  \n \nAccording to several staff members, EMS was assigned to \nORV’s MHU because he “failed to meet progam expectations” \nin a DYS sexual offender rehabilitation program. At some \npoint in the past, he was diagnosed with a psychotic \ndisorder. He has not had symptoms of psychosis at ORV and \nhe has suggested that he may have misrepresented the truth \nby saying he heard voices soon after he was detained by \npolice for his offense as a way to make sense of his \nbehavior and to avoid consequences.  \n \nEMS was transferred to the ORV MHU from another DYS \nfacility in Summer 2008. During his first week, he \nassaulted a MHU resident. He has not engaged in disruptive \nbehavior since then. \n \nORV staff told me that EMS seemed relieved when they \nsuggested that he may not be psychotic. He “functions \nas a leader” on the MHU and has cooperated with treatment, \nincluding twice weekly sexual offender programming. When he \nwas at the referring facility, he received daily sexual \noffender programming and the expectations were higher. Now \nhe is in a MHU setting where his functioning is higher than \nmost if not all other residents. He has coasted through the \nrehabilitation program and has video game privileges, and \nother rewards that he might not earn in a more restrictive \nor more challenging program. Thus, EMS, who is Caucasian, \nhas not really been rehabilitated. \n \nEMS is prescribed a low dosage of an antipsychotic \nmedication and therapeutic dosages of a mood stabilizer \nmedication and an antidepressant medication. MHU staff said \nthey have been unsuccessful with their efforts to transfer \nthis Caucasian youth to the SMU or a residential setting. \n \nMy interview of EMS, in the presence of staff, compelled me \nto support the MHU staff’s conclusion that the EMS should \nnot be assigned to the MHU.

Prior to being committed to DYS, ESL apparently \nfathered one to three children. Also, ESL engaged in \ndisruptive behavior in school, including fighting and \nwalking out of classes. He had several previous delinquency \nadjudications for Assault, and Illegal Conveyance of a \nDeadly Weapon.   \n \nIn late 1999 ESL attempted to hang himself after he was \nremoved from his mother’s custody. He also engaged in fire-\nsetting and physically abused a cat during his latency \nyears. He has never been hospitalized at a psychiatric \nfacility and he began to experiment with recreational drugs \nwhen he was seven; by age thirteen years, he regularly used \nalcohol, cannabis, and ecstasy. His primary psychiatric \ndiagnosis is attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and \nrecords suggest he also has “one or more mood disorders,” \nincluding bipolar or manic depressive disorder. He has \nreceived mental health care at various institutions. \n \nESL had many past traumas, including the loss of his \nbrother who was killed by their mother’s former partner. \nRecords also suggest ESL’s brother’s death was related to \ngang activity; ESL was previously affiliated with gangs. \nAlso, his mother moved out of state in the past year. His \nlocal supports are limited to nonexistent. \n \nThe youth has spent significant time on the SMU. In a \nrecent two month period, ESL: engaged in a “group cafeteria \nfight,” had “gang-related” conflict youth from a different \nregion of Ohio, encouraged other youth to “bust out their \n[room] windows,” jumped on tables, threw chairs, and \nengaged repeated physical aggression towards another youth. \nAlso, he fractured another youth’s nose. \n \nAs a result of his behavior, ESL was placed on a Special \nManagement Plan and was transferred to the SMU. In early \n2008, the youth threatened to harm himself. A few weeks \nlater, he said his medication was not working. He was \npessimistic about his future and had thoughts of escaping \nfrom the facility and harming himself. About that time, 150 \n  26\n\nSK. v.

In late \n2008, the Release Authority 100 additional disciplinary \ndays to ESL’s commitment after he participated in a “STG \nfight.” \n \nOn December 12, 2008, a psychology staff-person says “It \nseems that it is difficult for [this] youth to disrupt his \ncycle of behavior.” However, I could find no interventions, \nin ESL’s psychology chart that were designed to assist the \nyouth with this task by addressing his concerns, including \nthe traumatic death of his brother, in therapeutic \ndigestible components.  \n \nKSJ \nYouth KSJ has a history of Assault and Harassment by an \nInmate complaints, In the past this African American boy \nsent a death threat to his assigned juvenile court judge \nand other courtroom personnel. KSJ’s brother is serving a \n45 year prison sentence. \n \nThe youth, who has a history of aggression in school and \nthe community, also has a history of serious mental \nillness. While hospitalized at a psychiatric facility in \nthe past, KSJ ate dirt when he was “trying to kill myself.” \nHe also made several suicide threats while there.  \n \nKSJ’s is a greater danger to himself when he uses drugs, \nsuch as ecstasy. On one occasion, when he was intoxicated, \nhe tried to shoot himself in the head with a hand gun. \nAlso, he received 62 sutures in a finger after he slammed \nit in a car door; he was intoxicated when this occurred, \ntoo. Additionally, he tried to jump off of a bridge when he \nwas under the influence of recreational drugs. To his \ncredit, KSJ has wisely selected his friends in the \ncommunity; they intervened whenever he engaged in dangerous \nlife-threatening behaviors. During a previous evaluation, \nKSJ said he would be dead if his friends did not help him. \n \nRecords indicate that whenever KSJ has been psychotic, he \nhas been under the influence of illicit drugs; when he \nabstains from drug use, he has not been psychotic. \n \nThe youth has experienced many traumas including \nabandonment by mom and the deaths of his newborn sister, \ngrandfather, uncle, and aunt.

His Full \nScale intelligence quotient, IQ, is 66, which places him in \nthe mild mental retardation range of intelligence (55 – \n70), however a 17 point difference between his verbal and \nperformance scale scores, 77 and 66, are suggestive of a \nlearning disability and borderline IQ. Also, he is \nintolerant of being teased. Yet, this youth, who continues \nto have disruptive behavior and poor impulse control, is \nnot classified as vulnerable and has spent substantial time \non the SMU. As a matter of fact, on October 15, 2008, an \nadministrative override was granted to place the youth on \nthe SMU because he refused to accept a skin test for \ntuberculosis. \n \nHis recent offenses include:  \no  Removing a cast from his leg on October 8, 2008 \no  removing parts from a school computer with alleged \nintent to make a bomb on November 4, 2008  \no  telling staff he wanted to kill himself on November \n11, 2008 \no  writing a letter threatening to kill Acting \nSuperintendent Sutherland on November 17, 2008. \n \nThere was no documented evidence of mental health \ninterventions used to explore or address to the youth’s \nimpulsivity, aggression, grief, loss, or hyperactivity. \n \nSSB \nYouth SSB was detained after he stole his mother’s car. He \nhas in the DYS system since mid 2008 and apparently suffers \nfrom posttraumatic stress disorder due to chronic life-\nthreatening physical victimization, by his father during \nhis early childhood. SSB has physical limitations as a \nresult of this trauma. Records also suggest SSB has severe \nbehavior problems, and AD/HD. Additionally SSB, who is \nCaucasian, lost a sibling in the past.  \n \nIn the year preceding his commitment to DYS, SSB was \nhospitalized after he attempted to hang himself. Within \nDYS, he was physically aggressive at an outlying facility \nand was transferred to the ORV MHU for stabilization. On \nOctober 2008, SSB endorsed depression and he “wouldn’t \ncommit to safety.” He struggled with being away from his \nfamily and “feeling threatened by other youth.”  \n \n  28\n\nSK. v.

This is not his first DYS \ncommitment. He has been cruel to animals, has engaged in \nsexual activity on DYS property, and has urinated and \ndefecated in his room, which does not have plumbing \nfacilities.  \n \nASB, who experienced “extreme physical abuse” before his \nfourth birthday, was adopted when he was four-years-old. \nAbout five years ago, ASB was hospitalized after he \ncomplied with command hallucinations and cut a cat’s throat \nwith a chainsaw. His adoptive parents have severed their \nrelationship with him.  \n \nASB, who has working diagnoses of bipolar disorder, and \nAD/HD disorder was previously diagnosed with reactive \nattachment disorder of early childhood. He has engaged in \nbizarre and disruptive behavior at DYS. He isolates himself \nand he struggles to fit in with others. (Note: ASB pushes \npeople away by engaging in bizarre behavior; by doing this, \nhe successfully avoids being abused by others, but fails to \nmake the healthy relationships he craves.) \n \nIn mid 2008, the youth, who was assigned to the MHU, \nexposed his genitals to others and placed his feces in a \ndesk drawer. He confessed to the latter incident after \nstaff was unable to determine who had done it. (Note: A \nhealthier well-defended adolescent may never had made this \ndisclosure in an effort to avoid adverse consequences.) \n \nASB, who is now assigned to the SMU, has refused to \ncooperate with testing at ORV.

I get my respect.” He \nalso insisted he has “been on top” in every fight he has \nhad at DYS. Clearly, this youth, who was severely \ntraumatized at an early age, will do and say whatever is \nnecessary to convince others not to challenge him. His \nintellectual limitations make it challenging for staff to \nrefocus his behavior because staff does not have the skill \nset to manage youths with ASB’s cognitive challenges.    \n \nThere were no therapeutic interventions documented in ASB’s \npsychology chart that describe therapeutic efforts to \nengage ASB or to help him feel safe. \n \nTMZ \nYouth TMZ is remanded to DYS for Domestic Violence. He has \na history of AD/HD. Psychiatry staff says in a December 9, \n2008 note, that TMZ “tells me that he has not been \ncompliant with Strattera [atomoxetine, a medication for \nAD/HD] because. . . it is distributed at such an early hour \nin the morning here on the SMU.”  Although morning \nmedications are supposed to be distributed at 6:30 AM, \nnursing staff have been issuing morning medications to \nyouth at 5:00 AM on the SMU. \n \nOn January 6, 2009, psychology staff says “psychology \nfollow up is likely to be minimal as youth TMZ does not \ndisplay any motivation for individual counseling.”  He had \ntwo years added to his commitment apparently due to STG \nbehavior (fighting and threatening to kill someone) and \nhaving a toothbrush shank.   \n \nYouth TMZ told me that this is his eighth visit to the SMU. \nHe has been there since October 2008, after he wrote a \nletter to his sister that contained gang language. \n“Security opened it.” Although TMZ knows using gang \nlanguage is against the rules, he said, “That’s how we [TMZ \nand his sister] talk all the time.” He acknowledged \nengaging in frequent gang-related activity at ORV “because \nthat’s how you survive.”  \n \nOn one occasion, he stole a phone and made a 135 minute \ncall to his sister. “They [security] recorded it.” He said \nthe action and consequences were “worth it” because he was \nable to connect with his sister for the first time since he \ncame to DYS.

I plan to do my time so I can get out of \nhere.” \n \nTMZ said he finds the ORV psychiatrist accessible. The \nyouth said he did not believe that SMU assignments were \nracially biased and he would “never go” to the MHU because \n“I’m not crazy. I mean I got (sic) problems, but not like \nthat.” TMZ prefers to continue to receive mental health \ncare on the BMU. \n \nXSC \nYouth XSC, who is on the SMU Blue Phase of treatment, was \nadmitted to DYS in late 2006 for a sexual offense. He said \nthat in April 2008 he had “a death in the family.” After \nthis loss, he struggled with containing his anger; his \nbehavior became increasingly violent. He said he had \n“nineteen acts of aggression, including one serious staff \nassault, eight staff/peer assaults and one weapons \nviolation.” He acknowledged engaging in all the offenses \nexcept the serious staff assault, which he intends to \nappeal. \n \nAs with many sexual perpetrators, XSC was a victim of \nsexual abuse prior to committing his offense. He suffers \nfrom depression and posttraumatic stress disorder and is \nprescribed an antidepressant medication and a sleep \nmedication. He also has a medical condition that may render \nhim prone to psychosocial difficulties. \n \nXSC, who is Caucasian, said that he does not feel safe in \nthe presence of other youth, “especially in school” because \nof the aggression and gang-related activity that occurs \nthere. XSC does not want to join a gang. He wants to \ncomplete his commitment and to return to the community.

He found it easy to advance through the SMU red-\nyellow-blue level system. He suggested that the SMU could \nbe more successful if staff were consistent. For example, \nat times, staff may avoid confrontation with a disruptive \nyouth and chose not to reduce a youth’s level because the \nstaff member does not want the youth to retaliate.  \n \nXSC said, “Some kids learn they can get away with things \nand they keep doing it.” Examples provided included \nrefusing to return to a cell and attempting to attack a \npeer. XSC said that juvenile corrections officers should \nconsistently “slap a red level” marker on the door of any \ndisruptive youth as soon as he goes into his room. “That \nwould send a clear message. They’d stop messing around so \nmuch.” \n \nAlso, youth that are not emotionally ready for school \nshould not be encouraged to attend classes; they should \nreceive education services on the SMU. The teachers \ncomplain about disruptive youth and “we don’t learn,” said \nXSC.

Prior to being detained, he made \nhomicidal threats and brought weapons to school.  \n \nTSQ described himself as “quick to anger” and he tends to \n“flip out” if his anger persists. In the past year, he has \nwritten a suicide note, ingested a small amount of cleaning \nfluid, and made verbal suicide threats. He is prescribed \ntwo medications for attention deficit/hyperactivity \ndisorder and his records suggest he is “not motivated for \ntreatment.” Yet, there are no notes in the youth’s record \nwhich suggest that a trauma history has been taken or that \nhis emotional concerns have been therapeutically addressed \nby psychology. \n \nSSS \nNineteen-year-old SSS was remanded to DYS in late 2006 for \nAggravated Robbery. He was the respondent to an arson \n  32\n\nSK. v.

SSS \ntransferred to ORV’s SMU from another DYS facility after he \nattacked two juvenile corrections officers. He has lived on \nthe SMU for less than one month and is on Red Phase. He \nsaid he prefers the SMU because he has more phone contact \nwith his family. “In GP [general population]” you only get \nphone calls as time permits. They think you can use the pay \nphones over here. My family can’t afford that. Here [on the \nSMU] you get a five minute phone call every month.” \n \nHe described his “goals on red. I have to identify the \nvictims I created; identify thoughts I had when creating \nthe victims; identify five victims; [and] put myself in \nthey (sic) shoes.” \n \nThe youth has regrets about not completing the program at \nhis previous facility. “They had greater expectations; \nvictim awareness was important.” His rehabilitative time \nwas “more productive. We had daily groups.” Since arriving \non the SMU, SSS has attended five or six group sessions. He \nvolunteered that, at this point, many of his peers assigned \nto the SMU, “don’t want to do nothing (sic) with their” \nlives. \n \nSSS made the following suggestions for improving the SMU \nprogram: \n1.  Design and assign “groups based on [each \nyouth’s] motivation level.” \n2.  Have life skills groups “so we will have some \nskills when we get out of here.” \n3.  Develop peer support programs. \n4.  “Offer people different alternatives.” \n5.  Require youths to maintain “daily journals.” \n6.  Train and require youth to engage in \n“reflective thinking.” For example, ask “us to \nthink about ‘How do I get to the point where I \nknow my anger is out of control?’”  \n  33\n\nSK. v.

Psychiatry is marginalized in the DYS system. \nThis makes it difficult for youth with serious \nmental illness to be evaluated and stabilized \nusing a behavioral health team approach. This \nneeds to change. \n \n2.  There is no child psychiatric leadership within \nDYS. In view of the severity of the mental \ndisorders in the DYS population, and the fact \nthat general psychiatrists work within the \nsystem, a full-time child psychiatrist is needed \nto oversee the DYS Behavioral health system, to \nprovide consultation, to conduct peer review, to \nfacilitate training interventions, and to \nreinforce a medical model of caring for youth \nwith serious mental illness that comports with \nthe community standard. \n \n3.  The ORVJCF dictation system for psychiatric care \nneeds to change so that the comprehensive \ndictation record of a youth’s most recent \npsychiatric care does not leave the facility \nwith the psychiatrist. The current practice puts \nconfidentiality at risk, and is not cost \neffective although a better quality note is \nproduced for the record. There are cost-\neffective in-house alternatives that may meet \nthe dictation needs. \n \n4.  Doxepin and other unsafe medications should not \nbe used in juvenile corrections populations when \nthey are not FDA approved for use in children \nand when safer alternatives are available. \n \n5.  The nursing practice of crushing enteric coated \nmedications must stop. \n \nPsychology \n \n6.  As a group, the skill set of DYS psychologists \nat ORVJCF is grossly deficient. Training is \ndesperately needed. Staff inexperience has \n  34\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nresulted in youth receiving additional DYS \ncommitment time, because the youth have not \nreceived evidence based treatment interventions \nfor their mental disorders.  \n7.  Several psychology staff tend to “blame the \nvictims” for their diagnosable psychiatric \ndisorders. This is due to clinical inexperience \nand inadequate supervision. Not all \npsychologists receive training on evaluating and \ntreating challenging youth, especially youth \nfrom inner-city environments and youths of \ndifferent cultures and backgrounds. \n \n8.  Many ORVJCF psychologists do not know how to \ntreat youth with externalizing (disruptive \nbehavior) disorders. Disruptive youth may suffer \nfrom treatable psychiatric disorders that must \nbe diagnosed and treated in an effort to contain \ntheir behavior. Youth with improved behavior do \nnot receive additional commitment time from the \nRelease Authority. Thus, youth are receiving \nadditional DYS commitment time because of poor \nstaff training and supervision. \n \n9.  In several cases, when youth have been open with \npsychology staff about past trauma and current \nsymptoms suggestive of treatable mental illness, \nsuch as posttraumatic stress disorder, staff has \nresponded by intentionally removing youth from \nthe psychology caseload. Youths have been \ndeprived of access to competent mental health \ncare and have been blamed for their symptoms. \nYouth accountability, for purposes of the \nRelease Authority, should begin after treatable \nmental disorders have been stabilized. \n \n10. Although many SMU youth are challenging, \ndisruptive, and have violated DYS rules, I could \nfind no documentation of consistent efforts by \npsychology or social work staff to address these \nbehaviors using constructive evidence based \ninterventions. \n \n11. With the exception of one session of the new SMU  \nAnger Management Group, there is no \ndocumentation of group therapy activities at \nORVJCF. This leads one to question the quality \n  35\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nof programming, supervision and monitoring \npsychologists at ORVJCF. \n \n12. Psychologists at DYS do not contact families; \npsychiatrists and social workers do. This \npattern needs to change. \n \n13. There was no evidence to suggest that \npsychologists have been trained in or use \nTrauma-Informed Care or Cognitive Therapy \nprincipals when they interact with youth. I \nhesitate to comment about techniques used with \nyouth on the MHU, because I did not explore \nthose records thoroughly.  \n \nSocial Work \n  \n14. Social Workers on the SMU are not integrated \ninto the behavioral health team. This results in \nfragmented care and communication. \n \n15. Social Workers do not document their contacts \nwith youth and with families. \n \nYouth Quality of Life \n \n16. Youth do not receive sufficient affordable phone \ncalls in the general population. Thus, regular \nfamily contact is not an incentive for youth \nthat remain in the general population. \n \n17. The grievance system doesn’t work; this was a \nunanimous conclusion. \n \n18. Although youth have been deprived of competent \nmental health care to address their emotional \nand behavioral concerns, they have received \npunitive consequences, including an extension of \ntheir DYS commitments. Thus, the youth have been \npunished because of staff’s clinical \nindifference to youth mental health \nrehabilitative needs. This practice is \nunacceptable. \n \n \n \n \n  36\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nVulnerable Youth \n \n19. Vulnerable youth, including those of small \nstature and those with cognitive limitations \n(including IQ <50 = moderate mental retardation \nrange) have been denied an opportunity to be \nplaced in the least restrictive setting for \ntheir rehabilitative needs; they are required to \nremain on the mental health unit. \n \n20. The presence of vulnerable youth on the mental \nhealth unit has stigmatized the environment and \nmade it unattractive to youth that need more \nintensive mental health care. Thus, these youth, \nwho choose “badness” over “madness,” are not \nforthcoming regarding the severity of their \nmental health symptoms, suffer unnecessarily, \nand are disruptive members of the ORVJCF \ncommunity. \n \nTreatment Refusals \n \n21. Medication over parental objection, in the \ninterest of community safety, is not \nsufficiently used in the DYS setting. This \nprocess needs to be examined further, especially \nsince parental refusal of treatment may not be \nin a youth’s best interests. \n \nThe Mental Health Unit \n \n22. Mental Health Unit Staff are not given \nsufficient authority regarding who is admitted \nto the Mental Health Unit and who may leave it \nto go to the SMU or the general population \n \n23. Psychiatrists are not given sufficient authority \nregarding who is admitted to the Mental Health \nUnit and when they may leave the unit. \n \nSMU Program \n \n24. The SMU Admission Tool wholly inadequate. \n1. The documentation that describes how \nthe Tool was standardized is not \navailable. Therefore, one must make an \nadverse inference about the design, \n  37\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nmotivations, and intent of the Tool’s \ndevelopers. \n2. The Tool does not take severe acute \nmental illness into account as a \nmitigating factor related to disruptive \nbehavior. \n3. The Tool is not normed on the \npopulation it is used to evaluate. \n4. The tool has an arbitrary cutoff that \npunishes 50% of the youth that are \nevaluated.  \n5. The Tool doesn’t take staff competence, \nand quality of treatment programs into \naccount. \n6. The Tool punishes youth for inadequate \nstaff training and competence. \n7. The Tool punishes youth for the absence \nof evidence based programming at \nORVJCF. \n \n25. The communication between psychiatrists and SMU \nstaff is inadequate in view of the mental \ndisorders and the severity of youth behavior on \nthat the SMU.  \n \n26. The frequency of psychiatric follow up for SMU \nyouth is also deficient in view of the severity \nof the behaviors of these youth. \n  \n27. Existing SMU psychiatric and behavioral health \npractice protocols are not cost effective in \nview of the level of disruption and distress \nthese youth contribute to the ORV community.  \n \nAdministration \n28. The absence of support staff and supplies on or \nnear the SMU is not cost-effective and is not \nconducive to smooth Unit operation. Skilled \nbehavioral health staff, including social \nworkers, are spending too much time on clerical \nfunctions. This practice deprives youth of \ndesperately needed care. \n \n29. The SMU is running out of booklets for \nbibliotherapy. Adequate supplies are needed for \na program to be successful. \n  38\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \n \nRecommendations \n \nPsychiatry \n \n1.  A full-time board certified child psychiatrist, \npreferably with juvenile corrections experience, \nto oversee the team of psychiatrists and the \nmental health units throughout the system and to \noversee the MHU, in an effort to move towards a \nmedical model of behavioral health care for the \nmost psychiatrically unstable youth. The child \npsychiatry administrator will facilitate \ninternal review of clinically challenging youth, \nwill accelerate the stabilization of these \nyouth, and will introduce the scaffolding of a \nprofessional support and consultation network \nfor psychiatrists, including those that lack \nchild psychiatry training.  \n \n2.  Psychiatric follow up should occur as frequently \nas weekly, especially on the SMU, when a youth \ndoes not adhere to medication therapy. \n \n3.  Each youth on the SMU that receives psychiatric \nservices should be evaluated by the psychiatrist \nat least twice monthly until he has demonstrated \nsatisfactory treatment response and sustained \nstability on his medication program. At that \npoint, the youth should be more receptive to \nother therapeutic interventions. \n \n4.  The ORVJCF psychiatrist should increase usage of \ndissolvable medications for youth that are not \nresponding consistently to previously effective \nmedication and for youth that are suspected of \ncheeking medications.  \n \n5.  The ORVJCF psychiatrist should attend treatment \nteam meetings on the SMU in a leadership and \neducational capacity; this practice should \nenhance the quality of mental health care on the \nSMU. \n \n6.  The psychiatrist should not expect nursing staff \nto crush enteric coated medications as the \npractice does not meet the community standard. \n  39\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \n \n7.  The psychiatrist should cease from using \ndangerous medications, such as doxepin, when \nsafer alternatives are available. \n \nPsychology \n \n8.  All staff conducting risk assessments for \ndangerousness of youth, including suicide and \naggression, should receive in-service training \nwith increased frequency, at least twice per \nyear, in the interest of community safety. \n \n9.  A video or slide show training program for risk \nassessment evaluations should be designed so \nthat staff may review risk assessment issues \nwith greater frequency. \n \n10. Training on mental disorder diagnosis, taking a \ntrauma history, Trauma-Informed Care (or a \nsimilar evidence based program), and crisis \nintervention are desperately needed for \nbehavioral health staff, who frequently miss \nposttraumatic stress disorder, depression and \nother treatable diagnoses. \n \n11. The SMU Psychologist should receive additional \ntraining in risk assessment, diagnostic \nassessment, therapeutic interventions and \nTrauma-Informed Care (or a similar evidence \nbased program) with all due expedience. \n \n12. The SMU Psychologist and should visit a more \nestablished SMU in a different juvenile \ncorrections system so he may develop a better \nappreciation for how fully functional SMUs are \nsupposed to run. This excursion should be \narranged with all due expedience. \n \n13. ORVDYS psychologists should make reasonable \nefforts to involve families in the treatment \nprocess. This will facilitate gathering \nadditional history; also, invested families may \nmotivate youth to exercise increased behavioral \ncontrol. SMU social workers already have had \nsuccess with this practice. \n \n  40\n\nSK. v.

Behavioral health staff, including psychiatry, \nshould immediately cease from listing conduct \ndisorder as the primary diagnosis for youth that \nsuffer from other psychiatric illnesses. This is \na pejorative practice that suggests these youth \ncannot be treated. \n \n15. Behavioral health staff, including psychiatry, \nshould refrain from listing Conduct Disorder as \na diagnosis for youth until staff is adequately \ntrained and have documented exhausting \nreasonable evidence based assessment and \ntreatment interventions, including full \nmedication trials, designed to alleviate the \neffects of more treatable psychiatric disorders \nin youth. \n \n16. The SMU Psychologist should invite the \npsychiatrist to attend SMU treatment team \nmeetings. \n \nSocial Work \n \n17. Social work documentation needs to improve so \nthat there is a consistent record of \ninterventions and clinical responses to those \ninterventions. \n \n18. Social workers should not hesitate to request \npsychiatric intervention for youth assigned to \nthe SMU. \n \n19. Social Workers could benefit from SMU and \nbehavior management intervention, and \ndocumentation training. \n \n20. SMU social workers should invite the \npsychiatrist to attend treatment team meetings. \n \nYouth Quality of Life \n \n21. The Quality of the grievance system needs to be \nreviewed in view of staff and youth complaints. \n \n22. The phone privilege system should be reviewed; \nincreased phone calls in general population may \n  41\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nmotivate some youth to do what is necessary to \navoid going to the SMU. \n \nVulnerable Youth \n \n23. Vulnerable youth that do not suffer from acute \nserious mental illness should be assigned to a \nunit dedicated to meeting their needs. \nAccommodating these youth on the MHU is not a \ncost effective operation from a service delivery \nstandpoint. Also, the presence of vulnerable \nyouth on the MHU makes it a less attractive \noption for youth with acute mental illness who \nmay engage in disruptive behavior so they will \nbe considered “bad” instead of “mad.” \n \n \nThe Mental Health Unit \n \n24. The Mental Health Unit should be used to provide \nservices for youth that are acutely impaired by \ntheir mental disorders. \n25. A history of STG activity should not preclude \nyouth from being admitted to the MHU. If there \nis an immediate STG concern, then the SMU may be \nused as a temporary alternative. However, if the \nSTG issue is sufficient to continue denying MHU \nlevel services to youth with acute serious \nmental illness, then an alternate option, such \nas a second MHU or inpatient hospitalization \nshould be considered. \n \n26. Vulnerable or fragile youth that are chronically \nimpaired by physical and/or intellectual \nlimitations and that are not acutely impaired by \ntheir mental disorders should be assigned to a \nunit designed to accommodate their needs. \n \na. Assigning these youths to the \nmental health unit for residential \ncare does not comport with the \nrequirement for assigning youths \nto the least restrictive \nenvironment and is not cost \neffective, given the concentration \nof staffing, expertise, and \n  42\n\nSK. v. Stickrath Stipulation Agreement, 2:04-CV-1206        Behavioral Health Report \nORV Juvenile Corrections Facility site visit                                      February 11-12, 2009      \nresources that are invested in \nmental health units.  \n \nb. Also, removing these youth from \nthe MHU may reduce the stigma \nassociated with mentally ill youth \nreceiving services at the mental \nhealth unit. The unit may become a \nmore attractive alternative to \ndisruptive youth with serious \nmental illness, who tend to \nconceal the severity of their \nmental disorders, because they do \nnot want to be on a unit with \nvulnerable youth or “weird kids.” \n \n27. Mentally ill youth that no longer require the \nlevel of care offered on the mental health unit \nshould be transferred to a different residential \nunit; if a youth could benefit from behavior \nmanagement unit placement, then the placement \nshould be considered. Youth should not be \npermitted to coast on the MHU because they have \na remote history of acute mental illness. \n \n28. The psychiatrist should have input into whether \nor not a youth is admitted to or released from \nthe MHU, in accordance with community standards. \n \n1. Youth should not be transferred from \nthe MHU without the psychiatrist’s \nknowledge and approval unless the \npsychiatrist has already determined, in \nwriting, that the youth is sufficiently \nstable on medication to move to a less \nrestrictive setting. \n  \n2. Except in emergent situations, the \nfiles of youth being considered for \nadmission to the mental health unit \nshould be presented to the psychiatrist \nso that medical necessity may be \nintegrated into the decision-making \nprocess.  \n \n3. If the psychiatrist does not believe a \nyouth requires MHU placement he should \n  43\n\nSK. v.

When deemed appropriate by the mental health \nteam, including the psychiatrist, youth on the \nmental health team may be transferred to the \nspecial management unit or to general population \nso that they may benefit from the programming \navailable there.  \n \nThe SMU \n \n30. Youth assigned to the SMU that require a higher \nlevel of mental health services should receive \nservices from the MHU team until they are able \nto transfer the youth to the mental health unit. \n \n31. Youth with mental illness that are assigned to \nthe SMU should be evaluated by the psychiatrist \nat least twice monthly until the youth is deemed \nstable from a psychiatric standpoint.  \n \n32. Youth that will likely be transferred to the \nmental health unit from the special management \nunit should be evaluated by the psychiatrist at \nleast weekly until the transfer occurs. \n \n33. Treatment team meetings for mentally ill youth \non the special management unit should involve \nthe psychiatrist at least twice monthly to \nensure that behavior and related concerns are \nappropriately integrated into the medical \ndecision-making process; this intervention \nshould also help direct care and behavioral \nhealth staff develop a better appreciation for \nhow medications may influence behavior. \n \n34. In the interest of community safety, youth \nbelonging to rival gangs should not be released \nfor activities on the Special Management Unit at \nthe same time. \n \n35. Documentation of individual, group, and family \ntherapy sessions as well as treatment team \nmeetings on the Special Management Unit needs to \nimprove. \n  44\n\nSK. v.

Documentation of therapeutic interventions and \nhow youths respond to them needs to improve on \nthe Mental Health Unit and Behavior Management \nUnit. \n \n37. Increase structure on the SMU to reduce idle \ntime during which youth are more likely engage \nin disruptive behavior. \n \n38. Mental health education for youth (and staff) \nshould be initiated on the SMU. Phenomenology, \ntreatment and relapse prevention education \nshould begin for youth (and staff) so that youth \nmay become better informed consumers of mental \nhealth services and staff develop a rudimentary \nunderstanding of how mental healthcare may be \nused as a resource to maintain safety and \nrehabilitate youth assigned to the SMU. \n \n39. Standardized diagnostic tools should be used on \nthe SMU and MHU to screen youth for mental \ndisorders, including depression and AD/HD, and \nto measure treatment response. Such \ndocumentation will enhance communication among \ndirect care staff, teachers, social workers, \npsychologists, and the psychiatrist. Systematic \nmeasuring of psychiatric symptoms also will \nimprove the quality of care provided to youth. \n \nAdministration \n \n40.

A more balanced evidence based SMU \nadmission process. \nb. Improved staff training. \nc. Increased flexibility in moving \nyouth between the SMU and MHU. \nd.

Adequate clerical staff needs to be hired to \nfacilitate staff access to data, parents, and \neducational materials. \n \n42.  The psychiatry dictation protocol should not \npermit the psychiatrist to take clinical data \noff grounds. Staff should be hired to transcribe \ndictations and to manage the files. Several \ncost-effective options exist. The psychiatrist’s \ntime will be better spent meeting with patients. \n \n43.

Stickrath \nFact-Finding Final Report \nDecember 13, 2007 \n \n \nUnited States Magistrate Judge Kemp appointed Fred Cohen as Independent Fact \nFinder on May 18, 2007.   Following an investigative protocol approved by counsel, I \nassembled a team of 10 experts and we conducted intensive site visits of various Ohio \nDepartment of Youth Services (ODYS) facilities, interviewing staff and youth; ODYS \nofficials were interviewed, records and various studies and reports were assembled and \nstudied, policy and procedure were studied and so on. \nThe Final Report is an amalgam of the entire team’s work.  The individual expert \nreports are assembled as Appendix D and properly may be viewed as resource material \nfor this Report.  In the event of any real or apparent contradictions, the Final Report is \ncontrolling. \nS.H. is a broadly drawn, multiple-conditions, class action case that includes all \nyouth who are or will be committed to the ODYS.  The issues raised by Plaintiff’s \nComplaint (April 4, 2007), include the application by staff of unnecessary force; arbitrary \nand excessive use of isolation and seclusion; arbitrary and excessive discipline; \ninadequate mental health, medical, and dental care; inadequate education services; \ninadequate structured programming; broadly inadequate training of staff; an unsafe living \nenvironment; and a dysfunctional grievance system.  The Final Report addresses all these \nareas and some other areas (e.g., Release Authority, grievances, and training) that are \ninseparably related to the primary issues raised by Plaintiffs. \nThe Final Report sustains each area of the complaint, in varying degrees of \nintensity.  Should any of the findings be viewed as conclusionary, as not adequately \nsupported by its accompanying text, the read again is referred to the resource material in \nAppendix D. \nMost ODYS facilities were found to be overcrowded, understaffed, and \nunderserved in such vital areas as safety, education, mental health treatment and \nrehabilitative programming. \n  i\n\nExcessive force and the excessive use of isolation, some of it extraordinarily \nprolonged, is endemic to the ODYS system.   \nJuvenile Correctional Officers (JCOs) bitterly complained about the excessive use \nof mandated overtime, a practice at least partly driven by understaffing, which we \nestimate to be 188 FTE, JCO positions.  JCOs function now more like prison guards (or \npolice officers) than trained partners in a shared rehabilitative effort.  Without additional \nJCOs who are far better trained and psychologically equipped for this difficult job, \nODYS likely will continue to vacillate between the rhetoric of treatment and the reality of \nthe adultification of the agency. \nWith a population as psychologically undeveloped and damaged as the ODYS \nyouth, there must be a well-coordinated mental health system in place.  Our experts \nunanimously found, in effect, there is no mental health system.  What goes by the name \nmental health care actually is a series of well-intentioned responses to crisis. \nOne unsettling aspect of this constitutionally deficient mental health care is that I \nco-authored a Report in 1998 and then prepared a more comprehensive Report in 2004 \npointing out this same deficiency as to Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility.  I noted also \nthat there was a staff culture of violence there, a theme regrettably repeated in this Report \nfor ODYS as a whole. \nThere can be no claim of lack of knowledge regarding the paucity of mental \nhealth care.  Indeed, even as we visited Marion in recent months we found conditions in \nthe so-called Intensive Mental Health Unit appalling.  DYS officials seemed caught off \nguard at this revelation and then worked furiously to find a solution.  On December 17, \n2007, with just two hours prior notice, team member Barbara Peterson paid yet another \nvisit to Marion and the Intensive Mental Health Unit.  Ms. Peterson found encouraging \nchanges: additional office space, new carpet, additional clinical staff, and evidence of \nimportant advances in treatment planning and programming. (Brief Report appears as \npart of Appendix D to this Report.) \nFor mental health and rehabilitative care to meet minimal constitutional standards \nthere must first be dynamic leadership in Central Office; a reinvigorated and broadly \nshared sense of mission; the addition of clinical staff, especially psychiatric nurses and \nchild-adolescent psychiatrists; a continuum of care from reception to the home facility; \n  ii\n\nauthentic mental health units; access to hospital level care; quality assurance, peer \nreview, and discharge planning. \nThe needless and excessive use of force is engrained within ODYS, with Ohio \nRiver Valley, Marion and Indian River in the top tier on use of force, restraints, and \nisolation.   We consistently found flawed training, deficient oversight, seriously \ninadequate reporting and subsequent review of “incidents.”  Our findings support the \nconclusion that ODYS youth, with varying degrees of intensity depending on the facility, \nare not provided with the constitutional minima relating to a safe environment.  Their \nphysical and psychological well-being is at risk and often damaged at the present time.  \nThis environment, in turn, dramatically impedes whatever efforts are made to provide \ntreatment and programs. \nAs we note in the Report, we do not underestimate the daunting task faced by \nODYS, especially the JCOs, in dealing with this often difficult population.  Staff, \nhowever, cannot demean, provoke, insult and assault youth and then complain about a \nviolent environment.  We found that JCOs’ training and early indoctrination emphasizes \na “we-they” attitude and a youth’s sidelong glance or delay in following an order is then \nprocessed as a prelude to a dangerous encounter. \nToo often it is because some officers do not know how to, or care to, de-escalate.  \nJCOs have a legal obligation to sustain a safe environment for the youth.  In doing so, the \nJCOs will create a mutually safe environment.  Reinvigorated pre-service and in-service \ntraining of staff on use of force is essential and a high priority. \nIsolation, particularly in conjunction with various special management or \nbehavior plans, is used too often, for too long, and without adequate treatment or \neducational opportunities.  The extended — at times, months on end — use of isolation \n(i.e., segregation) must be immediately revisited and dramatically changed.  Imposing \nprolonged and highly deprivational isolation whether in the name of treatment, behavior \nmodification, or punishment is not constitutionally permissible. \nOur education expert, Ava Crow’s full Report on education is must reading.  It is \nattached as part of Appendix D.  While Ms. Crow is sanguine about the leadership \nprospects under new Superintendent Turner, there is little else she found that was \naffirmative or in compliance with some important legal requirements. \n  iii\n\nODYS’s top-down management style is found to give too little decision-making \nto education officials. Ms. Crow’s full report provides numerous examples of the \ndifficulties this causes. \nThere are far too few teachers and substitutes, a lack of schoolroom, office, and \nadministrative space.  On a randomly selected, given day, 43% (598 youth) were found to \nreceive less than the legally mandated, full school day. \nODYS is not meeting the mandates of various special education laws; the failure \nto implement the requisite IEPs is but one dramatic example. \nDisciplinary issues abound making education in ODYS facilities an often \nharrowing task.  Increasing disciplinary responses to student misbehavior does not seem \nto be the answer. If the education mission is to go forward, this area is one of the crucial \nareas for immediate resolution. \nThe system lacks academic and career technical counseling making re-entry \ndifficult for some, impossible for others. \nIn sum, the human and physical resources devoted to educating ODYS youth \nalong with the physical plant are utterly deficient and require basic overhauling. \nAs for facility overcrowding, only Mohican and Circleville operated under \ncapacity.  The other facilities operated at 141% of rated capacity.  When overcrowding is \ncombined with a staff culture overly reliant on the reflexive and excessive use of force, \nthis creates a combustible mixture. \nWith overcrowding, youth privacy is impacted, programs suffer, injuries increase, \nstaff suffers, and, in effect, any commitment to “help” is impaired.  The reduction of \novercrowding, addition of staff, and richer programming is in the best interests of the \nyouth and often overwhelmed staff. \nIn considering the estimated JCO staffing shortfall, any resolution of the S.H. \nlitigation should consider population restrictions or reductions and/or greater use of \nCommunity Correction Facilities, which our compressed examination rated quite \nfavorably.  Any agreement concerning staff should occur within the framework of any \nnew direction ODYS may elect to take and such additional study of staffing needs that \nthe parties may elect to undertake as a part of a settlement agreement. \n  iv\n\nAlso, a change in the job description and performance of JCOs seems vital.  That \nis, there should be a movement from “cop” to “counselor.”  The parties should consider \nchanges in recruitment and compensation in order to attract and retain highly qualified \npeople for this very difficult job. \nExcessive use of force, basically inadequate mental health treatment and \nrehabilitative programs, and the marginal functioning of the education system are the \nprimary deficits of ODYS.  If the system elects to continue to function within its present \noutline, there must be a major change in training, recruitment, the hiring of additional, \nqualified staff, quality assurance and peer review that is effective, and more evident \nleadership at the Deputy Director level. \nDirector Stickrath has a daunting task with the agency he inherited and he appears \ncommitted to leading the agency through the legally required changes and beyond.  He \nmust receive the necessary support staff and funds to move forward.  He should be \ncongratulated for continuing a policy that generally prohibits “handchecking” (requiring \nyouth to move about in a simulated handcuffed position) and allowing youth to converse \nduring meals, something not allowed by his predecessor.   \nAs for medical and dental care, the Report makes it clear that the Medical \nDirector spends too much time providing direct care and this, in turn, impairs his ability \nto provide needed leadership. There are problems with initial health appraisals, failure to \ndocument basic clinical information, chronic care is seriously compromised, medication \nadministration is below accepted practice standards, infection control is compromised, \nquality assurance is lacking, medical education for youth needs to be enhanced, and \nprofessional staffing levels are inadequate.  [See Final Report, page 152 for details.] \nThe overall ODYS dental care program was determined to be inadequate.  There \nare, however, sufficient numbers of dentists if they are supplemented with now non-\nexistent dental hygienists. \n“Changes need to be made in the areas of: staffing (dental assistant), \ndiagnostic radiography (pre-extraction radiographs), infection control \n(labeling of biohazards, sterilization of instruments, spore testing, gowns \nand patient eye protection) urgent care tracking (complaints of pain \nassessed, and consistently stabilized and documented by nursing or dental \n  v\n\nstaff within 24 hours), primary prevention (fluoride treatments and \nsealants, annual prophylaxis and adequate oral health education, access to \ndental floss),  categorizing treatment priorities-secondary prevention \n(caries stabilization-secondary prevention, annual follow up exams, \nfabrication of partial dentures without caries stabilization), dental record \ndocumentation (treatment plans, SOAP format), and access to care \n(written and verbal instruction on the specifics of requesting emergency, \nurgent and routine dental care).”  [Final Report, page 167.] \nThe impact of the Release Authority (RA) reverberates throughout the entire \nODYS system.  It is at the center of an arcane, legislatively created maze touching \njudicial and administrative decision-making.  For ODYS youth, the time added by the RA \nto the presumptive release date was a recurrent source of agitation and confusion. \nWhere youth were delayed in program completion and the delay was not \nattributable to the youth, frustration with deferred release was at its highest. \nA recent Report on the RA by the University of Cincinnati (Professor Ed Latessa, \net al.), found that from July 1, 2003 to November 30, 2006, ODYS youth spent 2,092 \nyears beyond what the so-called matrix (i.e., presumptive release date) prescribed.  See \nEdward Latessa, et al., An Analysis of the Ohio Department of Youth Services Release \nAuthority’s Decision Marking Process, pp. 16-19 (November 2007)(received by us on \nNovember 21, 2007, after the RA section for the Final Report was completed.) \nThe Final Report describes the Ohio law on point as confused and regressive.  \nProtection of the public is rhetorically mixed with concern for the development of \nchildren; accountability competes with rehabilitation.  The allocation of dispositional, \nrelease, and community supervision discretion between the judiciary, ODYS, and the \nRelease Authority is almost impossible to decipher, let alone detect some coherence. \nOhio, like a number of states, is constitutionally free to use a discretionary release \nauthority such as the RA.  The Report points out, however, that the functioning of the RA \ncontributes to the uncertainty and confusion of the youth in the system and it urges that \nthe RA itself be closely re-evaluated. \nThe “Latessa Report” did not have crucial data on treatment services and \ncompletion of services; it never mentions the impact of extended terms on the youth, and \n  vi\n\nsimply accepts the matrix as a given rather than addressing the inherent value to juvenile \njustice of presumptive sentences.  Any future evaluation must assess the continued \nviability, certainly in its present structure, staffing, and operation of the RA. \nWhile there is no constitutional obligation to have a grievance system, the system \nnow in use does not appear to function as a viable problem-solving mechanism.  Too \nmany JCOs simply brush off simple requests by youth by saying, “File a grievance, I’m \ntoo busy.” \nA good many ODYS youth have great difficulty in writing a coherent grievance, \norally presenting their “case,” and in pursuing an appeal.  There is, however, no \nmandated assistance for such youth.  Grievance coordinators have varying backgrounds \nand an ambiguous role. Grievances too often go unanswered or are answered late.  We \ndid note some progress in enhancing timeliness.  ORV remains particularly vulnerable in \nits handling of grievances. \nThere is a Youth Advocate position within ODYS that consists of one person, a \ncar and a cubicle.  Obviously, the incumbent cannot travel the state by himself and with \nno support staff he inherently is unable to serve as a viable Ombudsman. \nLooking at the grievance system and the Youth Advocate position as attempts to \ndefuse conflict; resolve individual complaints; and identify, then resolve systemic \nproblems, it is our finding that those objectives are not being achieved. \nIn conclusion, the allegations in the Plaintiffs’ complaint are essentially supported \nby this Report.  It is now up to the parties to construct a remedy consonant with these \nfindings.  A remedy may track, and improve on, the existing architecture of ODYS or it \nmay seek a broader reform by, for example, moving increasingly to a community-level of \ncare with smaller, local, richly staffed facilities. \nAn earlier draft of this Report was submitted for review by the Defendants to this \naction.  This led to a face-to-face discussion of various points by Fred Cohen and Barbara \nPeterson along with Director Stickrath and his staff and his counsel, Joseph Mancini.  \nSome adjustments have been made to the earlier draft and in the areas of treatment and \neducation I elected to include in whole or in part submissions from DYS. \nIn this Report we want to recognize the number of people we encountered within \nthe system — from JCOs to clinicians to Central Office — who do heroic jobs.  For a \n  vii\n\nJCO to stand-up for a youth, for example, in the face of derision from colleagues is a \nheroic act.  For a psychiatrist to go to work every day, and work incredibly long hours, in \na system he or she knows is dysfunctional is truly heroic.  For teachers to show up in \nclassrooms with students often less than enthusiastic about learning also is heroic. \nAs ODYS moves forward, it must build on these heroes and heroics.  They must \nbecome the models for change and their exemplary efforts the norm.  We also believe \nthat Chris Money, the relatively new Superintendent at Scioto, has gained traction and \nshe, along with Deputy Nan Hoff, represent the hope for the future at their respective \nlevels. \nFinally, the Paint Creek facility, with its low recidivism rates, intensive \nprogramming, and rich staff may be viewed as an important model for Ohio’s juvenile \nfacilities.  Our brief site visit and investigation led to some very positive findings but I \nconcede that further evaluation would be necessary before any wholesale adoption of the \nmodel. \n \nFred Cohen, Esq. \nJanuary ___, 2008\n  viii\n\n \nFACT-FINDING, FINAL REPORT \nS.H. v. Stickrath \nDecember 13, 2007 \n \nI.   FRAMEWORK: LEGAL & OPERATIONAL \n \nI am privileged to present to the Court and the respective parties in the above \ncaptioned matter, the Final Fact-Finding Report (Report) required in accordance with the \nCase Management Plan filed with the Court on May 18, 2007.  S.H. v. Stickrath, in brief, \nis a class action encompassing all persons who are or will be committed to the legal \ncustody of the Ohio Department of Youth Services and housed in the various facilities it \noperates or contracts with. \nThe Court certified the class on July 9, 2007 pursuant to a Motion for an Agreed \nUpon Classification Order. \nThe Second Amended Complaint in this mater was filed with the Court on April \n4, 2007 and is attached hereto as Appendix A. [That complaint mistakenly describes the \nlead Plaintiff as “S.W.”  I will refer to the case as S.H. throughout.]  The Complaint \naccurately may be characterized as a broad-based conditions lawsuit. \nClass counsel allege that the youth are subject to unnecessary force; arbitrary and \nexcessive use of isolation and seclusion; arbitrary and excessive discipline; inadequate \nmental health, medical, and dental care; inadequate education services; inadequate \nstructured programming; broadly inadequate training of staff; an unsafe living \nenvironment; and a dysfunctional grievance system. \nAppointed as Independent Fact Finder by United States Magistrate Judge Kemp \non May 18, 2007, I prepared an investigative protocol that has been approved by counsel \nfor the parties.  In brief, that protocol calls for site visits to the various DYS facilities \nwhereby youth and staff are interviewed; relevant files, protocols, and policy and \nprocedure studied; facilities inspected; and relevant activities observed. \nGiven the scope of the issues raised by the Complaint, with the approval of \ncounsel, the following experts were retained to serve as members of the investigative \nteam: \n  1\n\n \n(cid:131)  Kathryn A. Burns, M.D., M.P.H. \n(cid:131)  Fred Cohen, LL.B., LL.M.* \n(cid:131)  Ava Crow, J.D. \n(cid:131)  Edward J. Loughran, M.A.* \n(cid:131)  Steve J. Martin J.D.* \n(cid:131)  Barbara Peterson, R.N.* \n(cid:131)  Robert A. Prentky, Ph.D. \n(cid:131)  David W. Roush, Ph.D.* \n(cid:131)  Donald Sauter, D.D.S., M.P.A. \n(cid:131)  Ronald Shansky, M.D. \n(cid:131)  Leta D. Smith, Ph.D.* \n(* Indicates member of the “core team.”  Medical, dental, sex offender programs, and \neducation specialists were given site visit schedules different from the core team.) \nThe “core team” visited Scioto, Marion, Freedom Center, Circleville, Ohio River \nValley, Mohican, and Indian River. \nAva Crow, our education specialist, visited Scioto, Marion, Freedom Center, \nCircleville, Ohio River Valley, Mohican, Indian River, and Cuyahoga Hills. \nRon Shansky, M.D. and Don Sauter, D.D. S, accompanied by Barbara Peterson, \nR.N. of the core team, visited Scioto, Marion, Ohio River Valley, Indian River, and \nCuyahoga Hills.  It was my judgment that the medical and dental allegations could be \nfully understood without visiting all the DYS facilities.  I was prepared to have the \n“medical/dental team” expand their site visits if it appeared to be necessary.  In our \ncollective opinion, we learned enough from what was done to feel comfortable with our \nfact finding and conclusions. \nBarbara Peterson visited Paint Creek, a privately operated facility, on October 2, \n2007.   \nFinally, Robert Prentky, Ph.D. was retained as our expert on sex offender \nclassification and treatment.  He is a world-renowned expert in the field and he \nconstitutes an expert “team” of one.  I asked Dr. Prentky to visit Scioto and Circleville \nand study relevant policy and procedure as well as the all important assessment tools. \n  2\n\nThese facilities are most involved with sex offender treatment, especially Circleville, and \nwhile other facilities may have offenders who receive sex offender treatment, it was my \njudgment that study of the facilities described above would be adequate for our fact \nfinding and conclusions. \nOn November 2 and 3, 2007, the core team, absent Ned Loughran, along with \nAva Crow, met with Fred Cohen in Tucson, Arizona.  This was a highly productive, \ncross-fertilization meeting. \n \n \nThe table below reflects all site visits completed by all teams: \nDYS Facility  “Core”  Medical/Dental  Education  Sex Offender \nTeam  Team  Specialist  Treatment \n         \nCircleville  September 11-12  August 6-7  September 22-23 \nCuyahoga Hills    August 8-9  July 30- Aug 1   \nFreedom Center  August 1    July 26-27   \nIndian River  August 30-31  August 6-7  August 22-24   \nMarion  August 2-3  September 19-20  August 15-17   \nMohican  August 28-29    August 20-21   \nOhio River Valley  September 13-14  July 30-31  August 8-10   \nPaint Creek    October 2     \n  June 13-15 &       \nScioto  July 31-Aug. 1  September 17-18  July 24-26  September 21 \n \nAdditionally, Kathy Burns visited Scioto on August 27-28 and Marion on August 29-30 \n \nThere have been a number of other investigative activities that we have engaged \nin that also form a basis for this Report: interviews at Central Office with the Director \nand his ranking staff, field interviews with staff, discussions with other persons and \nacademics familiar with DYS, legal and policy research, and more. \nWhile this is likely to sound like the empty, typical, “thank you to all,” it is not.  \nDirector Stickrath could not have been more helpful and supportive of our efforts and for \nthat we all offer our heartfelt thanks.  The Director assigned Ms. Shelly Fitzhugh to serve \nas the agency’s point person with the team.  She gathered data, worked on travel and \ninterview schedules, answered questions, and made our difficult job much easier.  Ms. \nFitzhugh attended the above noted meeting in Tucson at the invitation of Fred Cohen and \nwas present at all of our deliberation.  She also has our heartfelt thanks. \n  3\n\nCounsel for the plaintiffs and the Attorney General’s office have been a pleasure \nto work with.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK & OVERVIEW \n \nA Damaged Population \nThe allegations made in the Complaint with varying degrees of intensity are \nessentially supported by our findings.  Perhaps our gravest concern relates to staff use of \nforce, isolation and restraint.  The paucity of mental health care we uncovered lacks the \ndrama, the shock value, of youths being taken to the floor by staff and placed in \ndangerous chokeholds, youths suffering a variety of broken bones and dislocations due to \nneedless and dangerous physical restraints; plainly disturbed youth locked into \nsegregation cells for 23 hours a day, 7-days a week for months on end with no semblance \nof needed treatment — and more, as will be developed, infra. \nI might add here that the Mohican and Circleville facilities were found to be much \nmore moderate in the use of force and various types of restraint. It is no accident that \nthese DYS facilities also are the most treatment oriented. This will be more fully \ndeveloped also, infra. \nThe youth confined within the ODYS system are, of course, not strangers to abuse \nand violence; to feelings of worthlessness and for some, an almost reflexive reaction to \nviolence with violence.  It is our premise that the persistent and deeply rooted culture of \nDYS staff violence either breeds, and most certainly reinforces, youth-on-staff and youth-\non-youth violence. \nWhenever this writer conducted group sessions with youth, the question would be \nasked, “How many of you experienced sexual or other physical abuse while growing \nup?”  I cannot recall having fewer than half the youth answer, “yes” and with the girls \nconfined at Scioto, the “yes” fell into the 80%-plus range.  I understand this is not a \nscientific study and the term “abuse” may have a different meaning to different youth — \ntypically as to the degree of the battery and consequent injury — but the answers of these \nyoung people give color and tone to some of the bland statistics residing in the scientific \njournals. \nInstitutions housing juvenile delinquents are not alone in the mistreatment of \nyouth.  Testimony before the House of Representatives, Committee on Education and \nLabor described thousands of allegations of abuse of troubled youth housed in residential \n  5\n\nprograms across this nation.  These facilities did not include public programs or systems \nsuch as DYS.1\nThe GAO conducted the study leading to the testimony and, inter alia, found that \nin 2005 alone 33 states reported 1,619 staff members involved in the abuse of youth \nhoused in residential programs; and in 10 selected, closed cases involving the death of a \nyouth, significant evidence of mismanagement was found including the hiring of \nuntrained staff. \nThere are no federal laws that regulate and define residential treatment programs \nfor youth. \nA recent series in the New York Times discloses shocking abuses in New York \nCity’s well-intentioned child foster care program.2  Children are found malnourished, \nburned, abused, and dead.  Oversight is virtually non-existent and media-cultivated child \nadvocates are uncovered as fraudulent, profiteering schemers. \nThe air is filled with rhetoric of abiding concern for our children.  And then there \nis the sobering practice of providing the least for those most in need.  The troubles we \nidentify at DYS are not isolated.  They reflect the failure of social welfare and social \ncontrol policies.  States do not frame child welfare policies — certainly not for juvenile \njustice — in terms of child welfare preferring instead an emphasis on crime control. \nPoverty is the single biggest risk factor for youth and poverty disproportionately \naffects minority children.3  The population of minority youth in the custody of DYS \nreflects this imbalance.4\nIn 1988, Congress amended the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \n(JJDP) Act to require states receiving federal funds to ensure equitable treatment on the \n                                                 \n1 Residential Treatment programs: Concerns Regarding Abuse and Death in Certain Programs for Troubled \nYouth (October 10, 2007) available at GAO-08-146T. \n2 Leslie Kaufman, Foster Children at Risk, and an Opportunity Lost, (NY Times, Nov. 5, 2007), available \nat www.nytimes.com \n3 See Barry C. Feld, Bad Kids: Race and the Transformation of the Juvenile Court, pp. 331-345 (1999).  \nProfessor Feld calls for the abolition of the juvenile court as a device to uncouple social welfare and social \ncontrol policies.  He notes the significance of “gun crimes” by juveniles and the impact this has had on \ndisposition practices.  In Ohio, “gun spec” offenses have led to increased minimum sentences and \ninfluenced the control tactics of the Release Authority. \n4 In fiscal year 2006, 59% of the youth admitted to the DYS were Black, Bi-racial, or Hispanic.  Whites \nconstituted 40.7% of admissions.  Males constituted 92.2% of the admissions. \nAt the same time 85% of the Ohio population was white, and the above minority groups totaled only \n15.5%. Adult and juvenile breakdowns for the overall population was not located. \n  6\n\nbasis, inter alia, of race and to assess the sources of minority overrepresentation in \njuvenile detention facilities and institutions (42 U.S.C. Sec. 5633(a) (16) [Supp. 1993].  \nIn response, a number of states examined and found racial disparities in their juvenile \njustice systems.  A review of these evaluation studies reported that, after controlling for \noffense variables, minority youths were overrepresented in secure detention facilities in \n41 of 42 states and in all 13 of 13 states that analyzed other phases of juvenile justice \ndecision making and institutionalization.5\nIn the context of this lawsuit we cannot alter the socio-economic policies that \neven directly influence the pool of eligibles for DYS jurisdiction.  We would be remiss, \nhowever, if we did not point to the larger context and clarify our belief that DYS is not \nsome isolated state agency that somehow malfunctions. \nWe do not underestimate the daunting tasks faced by ODYS in managing what is \noften a difficult population.  On the other hand, we did not look for extraordinary \nperformances producing miraculous outcomes. Staff, however, cannot demean, insult, \nand otherwise provoke youth in their custody and then complain about a violent \nenvironment.  Staff cannot impulsively react to a youth’s self-destructive behavior with \nneedless physical force at times creating life threatening situations for the youth.  The \nthree use of force examples contained on the attached DVD will illustrate needless, \nexcessive, and dangerous force more likely the product of a lack of training and effective \noversight than venality. \nStaff may not be required to create dreams but they need not shatter them either.  \nAdolescents who speak of going home must not be told, “you ain’t got no home” or \n“you’re a sex offender, who would want you released!?” \nAs novice JCOs launch their employment they are warned about the dangers they \nwill face; of the need to be vigilant, wary, and on guard.  A youth’s sidelong glance or \nseemingly mocking tone is elevated to a threat to survival.  A youth’s refusal to follow an \norder becomes a threat to one’s manhood and the forewarned dangerous environment \nsuddenly is real and the need to aggressively respond is at hand. \n                                                 \n5 See, for example, Carl Pope, Racial disparities in Juvenile Justice System, ch. 5 Overcrowded Times, \n1(1994). \n  7\n\nDYS facilities, however, are not the street and not the officer’s home; these are \ninvoluntary, custodial situations where the law governs use of force and not the street or \nautonomy of the home rule.  DYS facilities cannot be proving grounds for staff power.  \nThat power exists, of course, but must first be used to de-escalate, to teach alternatives to \nviolence, and to use only that force that is minimally necessary to preserve order and to \nprotect life and limb. \nAs this lawsuit moves forward, a dramatic reduction in staff violence should be \nthe first order of business.  It is difficult to imagine constructive mental health care, \nrehabilitative programming, and effective education occurring where youth fear staff and \nother youth, and staff fear youth. \nConstitutional Standard on Safe Environment \nThis is a damaged population, some far more than others and, at a minimum, DYS \nshould echo the physician’s mantra: “First, do no harm.”  The constitutional standard in \nsome of our areas of concern may be open to reasonable debate; e.g., the precise contours \nof the right to, and constitutional basis for, mental health treatment.  But the right to a \nreasonably safe environment echoes repeatedly through the reported cases and the \ncombination of excessive force, restraint and isolation in ODYS is closely tied to the \nright to be safe, the right not to be in constant fear and to not deteriorate.  See Doe v. \nStrauss, No. 84C2315, 1986 WL 4108, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 28, 1986) (unreported) \n“[Concluding] that what we have here is a long elevated Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendment right decisionally recognized in this state and many others. It protects \njuveniles when they are placed by state action in special custody, management and \ncontrol because of their homeless, their delinquent conduct, and their unmonitored living. \nIt is a right to care, management and therapy reasonably designed and calculated to effect \nrehabilitation, moral restoration and proper development.” \nIn K.H. v. Moran, 914 F.2d 846, 851 (7th Cir. 1990), the court held that \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315-16 (1982), made it clear that the Constitution \nrequires responsible state officials to take the necessary steps to prevent, inter alia, youth \nin state institutions from deteriorating physically or psychologically.  See also Mary and \nCrystal v Ramsden, 635 F.2d 590 (7th Cir. 1980), finding that youth have a constitutional \nright to be protected from harm inflicted by others.  Coincidentally, Mary and Crystal \n  8\n\nalso determined that it could be a constitutional violation for a contract psychologist to \nrefuse to visit Mary while she was in prolonged isolation.  To also suspend her from their \nregular program of treatment while so confined added another dimension to the cruel and \nunusual punishment she suffered.  635 F.3d at 598 \nIncidence of Mental Disorder \nIn considering the prevalence of mental disorder among the population of \nincarcerated youth, there is virtual unanimity that it far exceeds the estimate of between \n9% and 13% in the general population.  Joseph Cocozza & Kathleen Skowyna, Youth \nwith Mental Health Disorders: Issues and Emerging Responses, 7 Juv. Justice 3, 4 \n(2001).  For juveniles in confinement, the low estimate is 20%.  Gail Wasserman, et al \nfound that 67.2% of youth in secure placements in Illinois and New Jersey met the \ncriteria for the existence of a psychiatric disorder in the preceding month: Gail \nWasserman, et al, Assessing the Mental Health Status of Youth in Juvenile Justice \nSettings, Off. Juv. Just. & Delinq. Prev. 3 (June 2004).  \nThe highly regarded Linda A. Teplin, studying youth in detention, found 66.3% of \nthe males and 73.8% of the females met criteria for a mental disorder or substance abuse. \nLinda A. Teplin, Psychiatric Disorders in Youth in Juvenile Detention, 59 Archives of \nGen. Psychiatry 1133, 1136 (2002). \nThere are other studies where the estimates run as high as 76%.  In our own work \nin Ohio we found that for the 90 girls confined at Scioto as of June 2007, 80 were on the \nmental health caseload (89%) and 66 were taking psychotropic medication (73.33%).  \nThe males held in reception had much lower numbers, reflecting what I believe is a desire \nto defer diagnosis and treatment to the ultimate home facility.  Girls do, however, tend to \npresent with a much higher percentage of mental illness in juvenile and adult facilities. \nCuriously, in 2007 conduct disorders, drug dependence, PTSD, and mood \ndisorders were the most common Scioto diagnostic categories while in 2004, almost all \nthe girls on the caseload were determined to be bi-polar.  See, Fred Cohen, Interim \nReport: Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility: Girls Units, August 16, 2004 (hereafter \nInterim Report).  This reflects an issue that is endemic nationally to this area: lack of \nclarity and agreement on what constitutes a mental illness along with diagnostic \ndiscordance. \n  9\n\nCompeting Models \nThese two factors lead to another salient observation the response to which will \nhave significant implications for this Report and any remedial agreements that may \nfollow.  If the right to mental health treatment ultimately agreed upon here is limited to \nthe medical (or disease) model and kept within the limited boundaries of the Eighth \nAmendment right for adults, the first limiting factor will be serious mental illness and the \nother constitutional limiting factor would be the deliberate indifference, culpability \nstandard.  See Fred Cohen, The Mentally Disordered Inmate and the Law, ch. 2 (CRI, \nInc., 1998 & 2003 Supp., Second Edition in 2 volumes, now “in press”). \nSome argue that this limited legal and policy model is inappropriate; that an \nexpansive right to treatment for juveniles flows from the Due Process Clause and as an \nincident to being civilly adjudicated as delinquent with the right to rehabilitation, then, \nlinked to the civil status of an adjudicated delinquent.  See Fred Cohen, Ibid Section 20.3 \n[1] (2003 Supp.)6\nRehabilitation, as used above, becomes the larger category encompassing the \nmedical model of treatment while also including a right to individualized care for the \nentire set of behavioral problems linked to the youth’s delinquent behavior.  Neither \nserious mental illness nor deliberate indifference would be applicable.  Each youth would \nbe entitled to an individual treatment or rehabilitation plan not dependent on shifting \ndiagnostic categories. \nEducation: Holistic Approach \nEducation usually is dealt with independent of a treatment or rehabilitative \nconcern.  While there certainly are different legal mandates and objectives — e.g., \nachieving literacy — not usually packaged with treatment or rehabilitation, education \nissues should be seen as part of the effort of DYS to enhance the opportunities of youth in \nits custody to succeed, to avoid recidivating.  As Professor Douglas E. Abrams writes, in \ndescribing the much discussed “Missouri Plan:” \n                                                 \n6 In a CRIPA letter to Governor Musgrove of Mississippi regarding the horrendous conditions in that \nstates’ juvenile facilities, the DOJ stated that the Constitution requires that youth confined at Oakley and \nColumbia receive adequate rehabilitative treatment citing: Morgan v. Sproat, 432 F.Supp. 130, 1135-36 \n(S.D. Miss. 1977); Pena v. New York State Division for Youth, 419 F.Supp. 203, 207 (S.D.N.Y. 1976). \n  10\n\n[Because studies] have shown that confined youths who participate in \neducational and vocational training programs have lower risks of \nrecidivism, educational programming belongs at the forefront of \ndelinquency treatment and rehabilitation.  Sound programming requires \nqualified instructors, adequate books and other supplies, a student-faculty \nratio that permits individual attention, and clean classroom space \nconducive to the educational enterprise. The task may be daunting because \nso many delinquents enter state custody far behind in their studies and \nprone to \"act out.\" As in Missouri, educational programming should \nexceed the bare constitutional and statutory minima by implementing \nindividual assessments completed when the youth is admitted to the \nfacility.  (Douglas E. Abrams, Reforming Juvenile Delinquency Treatment \nto Enhance Rehabilitation, Personal Accountability, and Public Safety, 84 \nOregon L. Rev. 1001, 1081-82 (2005)). \nIn the Report (p. 35) prepared by Ava Crow, assisted by Anne Flynn, she notes \nthat 62% of all the DYS teachers express dissatisfaction with school safety.  Her overall \nassessment is equally grim. Federal requirements for special education students are \nbasically and systemically violated, security is found to trump education in most matters, \norganization and administration does not now further DYS’s own goals, staff and space \nare festering problems, youth placed in extended isolation are de facto denied education, \nfull school days generally are not provided, and virtually nothing is done to help youth \nwho are released successfully re-enter society. \nEducation obviously must be at the same table with mental health and \nrehabilitation.  Joint planning, implementation, and oversight are required and this, in \nturn, requires more staff, more space, and more time to collaborate. \nOur findings support the general observation that one is unlikely to find a facility \nwith a commendable mental health program but a singularly poor education and \nvocational program.  Indeed, where both components are substandard, there is likely to be \na corresponding over reliance on the use of force.  Where both components are viable \nthen use of force correspondingly is diminished.  As our educational expert, Ava Crow, \npoints out, those teachers rated most favorably as to their instructional process invariably \n  11\n\nfiled the fewest disciplinary infractions reports.  When this Report moves into more \ndetailed discussion of these areas, it will become even clearer that these areas of concern \nare interdependent. \nThe urgency of the excessive use of force problems dictates that it should be \namong the first areas addressed for change but it does not also follow that excessive use \nof force — like educational defaults — is somehow divorced from treatment, \nrehabilitation, and education. \nIf I may then take this somewhat holistic approach one step further, I would add, \nwhat the U.S. Department of Justice in its CRIPA letters and reports, describes as anti-\ntherapeutic conditions.  See e.g., DOJ, Letter to Mississippi’s then Governor Musgrove \n(June 19, 2003)(available at http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/findsettle.htm#CRIPAletters).  \nThe CRIPA letter notes that conditions at Columbia, one of Mississippi’s flawed juvenile \nfacilities, cause depression and mental deterioration.  There is a lack of activity, social \ninteractions, counseling, undue restraint, and fear. \nSimilarly, and with broad variations in Ohio’s DYS facilities, there is a harshness \nin the social climate that is created by verbally abusive and militaristic JCOs, the \nimposition of group punishments (even though forbidden by rule), excessive amounts of \npenal isolation — and more.  In a recent, albeit undated, letter (p. 2) signed “The Staff at \nMarion JCF,” the youth at Marion are described as “lost to society and will not, and \ncannot be reformed no matter what new program is attempted.”  Later, DYS youth are \ndescribed as a generation of violent predators treading water until release and the \nopportunity to reoffend.  This is not a promising basis for altering the current climate \nwithin DYS. \nThe individual experts’ reports are replete with calls to expand the JCO role from \npurely custodial to the inclusion of caseworker-like functions.  This, in turn, would \nenhance the professionalism of the position as well as the basis for compensation.  This \ncall for “role enhancement” may be chimerical if the Marion staff letter expresses widely \nheld staff beliefs.  Those attitudes, if unrestrained, can lead only to reform along a \nheightened security-punishment model. \n  12\n\nTeam member Ned Loughran, in his “Summary Report” of November 12, 2007, \nreached similar conclusions and also contrasted Ohio with jurisdictions attempting to \npursue a different path: \nThe Juvenile Correctional Officers (JCO), the direct care staff in every \nDYS institution I visited, constantly interact with the youths throughout \nthe day but so little of their interaction fosters rehabilitation.  The \ncorrectional officer’s relationship with the youths is basically a custodial \none.  Youths appear to be uncomfortable with staff and staff are \nuncomfortable with youths.  As long as uniformed correctional officers \nperceive their role in the institutions to be correctional rather than \nrehabilitative, the Ohio institutions will never become treatment programs.  \nOther states, such as California, Illinois and New Jersey that use \nuniformed correctional officers who are trained primarily in carrying out \ncustodial duties, experience similar problems — high rates of use of \nrestraints and isolation and high rates of injuries to youths and staff - as \nOhio DYS.  Staff and youth’s fear for their safety runs high in these \njurisdictions as well. \nMany other states interpret the role of direct care staff philosophically \ndifferent from Ohio.  These staff are called rehabilitation counselors in \nWashington State, youth counselors in Pennsylvania, youth care workers \nin Massachusetts, and youth correctional counselors in Oregon to name a \nfew jurisdictions.  The various titles of direct care staff imply that their \nrole is rehabilitative not custodial.  Staff do not wear correctional officer \nuniforms but rather their own clothing.  Pennsylvania outfits its youth \ncounselors with a golf shirt with a logo that identifies them as youth \ndevelopment center staff.    \nBeginning in May 2007, ODYS began to replace the current prison-like JCO \nuniforms with a civilian-type outfit consisting of a blue shirt and khaki pants.  Director \nStickrath (by Memo to Staff, May 17, 2007) explained that this is part of a more \ncomprehensive effort to create a youth-oriented environment. \n  13\n\nIn my interviews with JCOs held in every facility that the core team visited, there \nwere three consistent views expressed: (1) Mandation (i.e., required overtime) must be \ntotally overhauled. (2) JCOs require training in use of force and the signs and symptoms \nof mental illness, effects of medication, and non-compliance. (3) Staff numbers must be \nincreased. \nI heard concerns about personal safety, gang problems, and difficulties in \nmanaging some of the youth, but never to the extent of the defeatist, alarmist views \nexpressed in the Marion staff letter referred to earlier. \nThus, we can begin to embrace the interrelatedness of the seemingly disparate \nallegations made in the Complaint and substantiated by our investigation.  An \nenvironment of fear; an environment where youths undergoing sex offender treatment are \ntold by some staff, “Why do you worry about going home?  Nobody there wants you \nanyway;” an environment where youth are physically subdued with life and health \nthreatening techniques is not an environment conducive to effective care and treatment. \nIt will be for the parties to ultimately reach agreement on the model for “treatment \nv. rehabilitation” and the interrelationship of that model with education and use of force.  \nThe staffing, training, programming and disciplinary implications of the choice of models \nare profound.  To the extent that the Marion staff letter reflects systemwide beliefs of \nJCOs, there will be no “fix” without resolving the “mandation” issues; the underlying \nattitude of “nothing works” and the belief that it is staff who are more at risk than the \nyouth. \nMedical Issues \nJuveniles have health problems that are different than adults simply because they \nare still developing; brains are incomplete and bodies often not yet fully formed.  Given \nthe demographics of an incarcerated juvenile population, the usual developmental issues \nare exaggerated and the medical and dental needs of the population are much greater than \nwhat might be expected. \nThe American Public Health Association encapsulates these needs in their \nrecently issued Standards. \nPublic Health Rationale: Children and adolescents are still developing \nphysically and mentally.  They may have health problems that are \n  14\n\ndifferent from those of adults and that require the care of physicians and \nother health professionals with training and experience in adolescent care.  \nIn addition, incarceration itself may have a more serious emotional impact \non youth than adults. \nYouth in the justice system have substantial health needs.  Dental, mental \nhealth, and substance abuse problems, including the abuse of tobacco, are \nwidespread.  Many of the most common medical problems (i.e., traumatic \ninjuries, sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnancy) are directly related \nto impulsive, high-risk behaviors associated with immaturity. \nDental caries (soft, decayed area in a tooth) and fractured front teeth are \nthe most common physical health problems among incarcerated youth.  \nMoreover, adolescence is the age of greatest incidence of caries in the \npermanent molar teeth.  Filling existing caries and application of pit and \nfissure sealants to intact molars are highly effective interventions to stop \nfurther deterioration and preserve the permanent teeth into adult life. \nAsthma is the most common chronic medial condition among young \npeople, but there are a wide variety of other chronic diseases and disabling \nconditions originating in childhood.  For example, many of the chronic \nillnesses commonly associated with middle age first appear in \nadolescence. Early diagnosis, patient education, and effective management \nof diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking beginning in \nadolescence will prevent or reduce serious end-organ damage later in life. \nChildren have limited experience with and knowledge of health care \nissues.  Emotionally immature and impulsive youth react very poorly to \ndemands or ultimatums from institutional authorities.  Health care staff \nneeds to take a developmental approach to youth by answering questions \ntruthfully, patiently explaining the reasons for necessary procedures or \nmedications, and offering alternatives.  It is not uncommon for a youth to \nadamantly refuse care at one moment and then request services a short \nwhile later. (American Public Health Association, Standards for Health \nServices in Correctional Institutions, Standard VII.B (2003). \n  15\n\nAs will be discussed, infra, our findings indicate there are substantial problems in \nthe provision of medical care in the DYS system.  In particular, a chronic care system \ndoes not exist and significant problems exist as to the prescription, distribution, and \nstorage of medication. \nWe found no evidence of a sustained effort to provide these youth with a health or \ndental education program.  We did not detect a strong leadership role on those issues, or \nthe requisite oversight, emanating from Central Office. \nOhio Law: Confused and Regressive \nThe statutory law of Ohio certainly does not help to resolve any of the dilemmas \nassociated with following a coherent, consistent rehabilitation or treatment goal.  Ohio \nRevised Code Annotated (ORCA) § 2152-01(A) provides, in part: \n(A) The overriding purposes for dispositions under this chapter are to provide for \nthe care, protection, and mental and physical development of children subject \nto this chapter, protect the public interest and safety, hold the offender \naccountable for the offender’s actions, restore the victim, and rehabilitate the \noffender.  These purposes shall be achieved by a system of graduated \nsanctions and services. \nHere, at least some homage paid to the care, protection, and development of youth \nbrought into the juvenile justice system.  This mixed commitment to the youth, the \nvictim, and public safety threads its way through the labyrinth of the Juvenile Code with \nconcern for the youth gradually giving way to a victim-oriented, public safety, penal code \nmodel.  At ORCA, Section 5139.50 et seq., dealing with the Release Authority, the \ncriminal law model is rather clearly established.  At Section 5139.51(A), for example, \ndiscussing the release or discharge of a youth, there is provision for notice of \nconsideration of release or discharge to the committing court, prosecuting attorney, and \nthe victim.  I find no mention of such notice to the youth’s parent, guardian, attorney, or \nother mature person upon whom the youth may rely. (The latter term is used in the ABA, \nJuvenile Justice Standards Project to describe a mature friend not legally connected to the \nyouth.) \nIn re C.S., 874 N.E.2d 1177 (Ohio 2007) grappled with some complex issues \nrelated to a juvenile’s constitutional right to counsel in a delinquency proceeding.  While \n  16\n\naffirming the importance of the right, the Supreme Court of Ohio held the right could be \nknowingly and voluntarily waived and while a parent cannot “represent” their child they \nmay play an important role in the waiver decision. \nThe supreme court also made clear that while the juvenile code may have taken \non some characteristics of a penal code, it remains “an administrative police regulation of \na corrective character.”  The majority opinion reflects an oft-stated judicial view of \njuvenile justice: While rehabilitation may not be the only goal, it remains the primary (or \nimportant) goal. \nThe allocation of dispositional, release and community supervision discretion \nbetween the judiciary, the agency, and the Release Authority is almost impossible to \ndecipher, let alone detect some coherence.  One point does emerge, however, and that is \nthe “rehabilitative ideal,” slowly gives way, as noted, to a criminal law-like Code.  I \nwould assert that the punitive aspects of the DYS culture, the very architecture of such \nfacilities as Marion and Ohio River Valley, the security staff wearing of prison guard \nuniforms, the emphasis on punishment, responsibility and security cannot be detached \nfrom a Juvenile Code that is more criminal than juvenile. \nORCA Section 2152.11 “Range of dispositions of child adjudicated delinquent” is \nillustrative both of the criminal law flavor of the Juvenile Code and its Byzentine \ncomplexion.7  This Section is offense- and age-based in its allocation of judicial \ndispositional discretion.  It must then be configured with other provisions of law relating \nto the power of the Release Authority and DYS with its time enhancing authority \nexercised incident to disciplinary proceedings. \nIf we add the bewildering issues related to detention credit to this maze, the spirit-\nsapping complexity of the Ohio system becomes even more apparent.  Team member, \nNed Loughran, in his Scioto Site Visit Report (Aug. 26, 2007) writes: \n \nISSUE OF DETENTION CREDIT \n•  For example: A youth is committed to DYS by the court for 9 \nmonths.  The youth earns 60 days of detention credit (DC), which \nbrings his commitment down to 7 months.  The DYS Release \n                                                 \n7 The entire Section is reproduced as Appendix B. \n  17\n\nAuthority (RA) must conduct a release review for parole at the \nminimum sentence – in this case 41/2 months.  In this scenario, a \nyouth could be up for release review while still in the reception \ncenter. \n•  Extreme example (actual case): Youth entered reception center on \n6/27/07 with 148 days of DC on a six month commitment, having \nalready passed the mid-point in his sentence.  His minimum \nsentence is August 5.  He needs a release authority review before \nhe can be placed on parole.  The RA can give him additional days \nby utilizing the “matrix” looking at the presenting offense, the \nvictim, age of victim, whether or not there was injury to the victim \nand whether or not a weapon was used to commit the crime.  The \nRA can defer the parole decision based on treatment needs and a \nyouth’s behavior.   \n•  Example of a county giving detention credit:  A youth in a county \ndetention center is committed and placed on probation, i.e., \nsupervised in the community by the court.  The youth’s probation \nis violated and he ends up back in the detention center.  He is \nultimately committed to DYS.  The DC clock begins at the first \ninstance of placement in detention.  And some counties give DC \nfor placement time whether it’s in the community or a detention \ncenter.  The incentive for the county to give DC credit for any \nplacement is because the county pays for the bed up to the six-\nmonth or one-year sentence the judge imposes on the youth. After \nthat DYS pays for the bed. \n \nGIVING DETENTION CREDIT HAS BECOME A COMPLEX \nPROBLEM \nThe court sends data to the reception center via the Journal Entry.  DYS \nhas created a form called the Detention Credit Addendum to close the gap \n  18\n\nbetween information received on the journal entry and the actual credit \nthat the court intended to record on the journal entry. \n•  The formula: detention credit begins to accrue from the day the \nyouth is taken into custody and the day the youth is committed to \nDYS.  Add to the time in detention prior to commitment the time \nbetween commitment to DYS and admission to the reception \ncenter.   \nPROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY THE COURT LIAISON AT SJCF: \n•  The journal entry from the court doesn’t always have DC days \n•  Often times the reception center receives conflicting information \nfrom the courts between what is in the journal entry and what the \nDetention Addendum states. \n•  The way the county (Probation Officer and others) records DC \ninformation sometimes is not consistent with the information on \nthe journal entry and Detention Credit Addendum  \n•  Youths can appeal their DC by filling out a request to speak with \nlegal counsel \n•  The Detention Credit Addendum does not have the date the youth \nentered detention and the date he left for the reception center. \n•  The Catch 22: The Detention Credit Addendum was developed to \nclose the gap and get additional information for the purpose of \nawarding the correct DC.  Now the counties are not recording the \ninformation in the journal entry and waiting to include it on the \nDetention Credit Addendum.  Not getting the information needed \nto assess DC wastes time and impacts the time that DYS has to \ntreat youths. (Loughran, Scioto Report at pp. 9-10) \nThe youth in this system are utterly bewildered by this dispositional scheme.  \nThey repeatedly expressed to us their confusion; their feeling that the release and retain \nsystem is arbitrary and not particularly concerned with helping them.  Not knowing if and \nwhen you are “going home” and not grasping how and why that decision is made and \n  19\n\nthen remade, in our view, creates yet another, and significant, barrier to the rehabilitation \nof these youth.  \nWe understand that not all these structural-legislative issues are directly a part of \nthe litigation at hand, yet we would be remiss if we did not call attention to these matters \nsince they create a framework within which this litigation is played out. \nGuarino-Ghezzi and Loughran, describing the Ohio Juvenile System in 1994, \nfound 1800 youth in institutional settings (the approximate same number as of September \n2007).  Ohio is described as moving toward improvement in institutional programming \nand community alternatives.  The authors wrote hopefully about unit management; \nspecialized treatment; two new facilities designed to accomplish downsizing, more \nprogramming, and better medical and mental health treatment.  Susan Guarino-Ghezzi & \nEdward J. Loughran, Balancing Juvenile Justice 43-44 (1996). \nOhio River Valley (ORV) and Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility (Marion) \nwere opened in 1996 and 1999 respectively.  Whatever the ceremonial rhetoric, one \nglance at their architectural plans would disclose that each facility is designed as a very \nsecure prison.  Sad to say, our site visits disclosed that these new facilities are among the \nleaders in gratuitous staff-on-youth violence and are almost devoid of meaningful \ntreatment. \nThese facilities are the architectural embodiment of what S.H. team member, \nDave Roush, terms the adultification of Ohio’s juvenile justice system.  Scholars, like \nProfessor Barry Feld, argue that “juvenile courts punish delinquents in the name of \ntreatment but deny to them the protections available to criminals.” Barry C. Feld, Bad \nKids: Race and the Transformation of the Juvenile Court 288 (1999).8  Feld despairs of \nlegislators who are unwilling to provide for the welfare of all children providing for \nchildren who are delinquents. \nThis writer spoke at length with a 15-year resident who had been confined in \nORV’s Special Management Unit for about four months.  This meant confinement in a \nsmall, barely furnished segregation cell for 23 hours a day, 7 days a week.  A level \nsystem does allow youth to regain some freedom and amenities in two-week, discipline-\n                                                 \n8 See e.g., Aaron Kupchi, The Decision to Incarcerate in Juvenile and Criminal Courts, 31 Crim. Justice \nRev. 309 (2006), finding no differences among factors predicting sentencing across these two supposedly \ndistinct legal forums. \n  20\n\nfree increments.  The level system itself lacks any meaningful, procedural fairness, \ntreatment team input, or oversight. \nODYS’s current practice of isolating youth in these special units by whatever \nname the practice is given, is unconstitutional on its face.  Extended room isolation or in \ncells resembling those in use at Ohio’s Supermax (OSP) is a practice that should \nimmediately cease. \nAdequate treatment and educational opportunities in the isolation unit simply \nwere not present.  What was called a treatment team met weekly without the youth or a \npsychiatrist and functioned essentially as a unilateral classification-program committee. \nMarion’s Intensive Treatment Unit was similarly secure and similarly without \nadequate treatment.  We observed a tape of a slight, 15-year-old youth who had “cut” \nbeing subjected to a needless, life-threatening effort by five staff members to apply \nleather restraints.  Only when the youth instructed the staff, including a Unit Manager, on \nhow to apply this particular restraint did the horrifying, 35-minute incident conclude. \nThis same mentally ill youth later, and coincidentally, was observed during a \ndisciplinary hearing charged with creating an “institutional hazard;” that is, cutting on his \narm. The youth had no one to assist him; he was not informed of the potential \nconsequence of a plea, which he quickly entered; and he was not competent to challenge \nself-injury by a mentally ill youth as inapposite for a possible, sentence-lengthening \ndisposition. \nThe youth slowly withdrew as the hearing droned on; gradually settling into \nputting his head down into the arms he had enfolded at his desk.  This, in my view, was \nnot an act of official venality.  It was more likely a rigid adherence to a one-size fits all \ndisciplinary proceeding; it was the conversion of a therapeutic opportunity into a \npsychologically hazardous event.  It lacked elemental fairness and even a semblance of \nrationality.  It became all too emblematic of this facility. \nThe likelihood of settlement negotiations in S.H. was the stimulus for my modest \neffort to gain some understanding of Ohio’s Community Corrections Facilities (CCFs).  \nTo that end, I asked team member, David Roush to briefly visit the Northern Ohio \nJuvenile Community Corrections Facility in Sundusky and the facility in Canton. \n  21\n\nHis Report of October 19, 2007 is attached as Appendix C.  He noted that both \nfacilities operate very good treatment programs; that the small units are well staffed; \nyouth were polite, well mannered, and felt “safe;” and that the education program at \nNorthern Ohio could serve as a model. \nThere is more and it is all positive.  Should settlement discussions include \ndownsizing and a greater reliance on a community-based model, it would appear that \nOhio’s CCFs should be very seriously considered as models. \nIn the succeeding sections of this Report, we will use an area, or topical, approach \nas opposed to a facility-by-facility approach.  We will provide sufficient examples to \nsupport a particular finding but readers should be aware that the individual Reports, \nattached as Appendix D, and the notes of the experts will contain even more examples of \ncase studies and observations. \nThe direction of this Report has been discussed by most of the Team during a \ntwo-day meeting (Nov. 2-3, 2007) held in Tucson, Arizona.  This de Facto is the Report \nof the Team, although the Principal Investigator, Fred Cohen did the bulk of the writing \nand it is submitted in his name.  Readers will detect a certain unevenness in length in the \nvarious Sections that follow.  The fact that one section has far more space devoted to it \nthan another is not by itself indicative of relative importance.  I did not impose any rigid \nlimits on team members’ reports and, frankly, some just wrote more than others and I \nwielded a lighter editor’s touch than I might have. \nAs such, the writer accepts responsibility for any errors or editorial lapses that \nmay be found.  At the same time I wish to thank the members of the S.H. investigative \nteam for the high level of professional work reflected in their deadlines I felt constrained \nto impose. \n  22\n\nIII.  A SAFE ENVIRONMENT: FORCE, ISOLATION, AND RESTRAINT \n \nSafe Environment \nA safe environment is a necessary albeit not sufficient requirement for achieving \nany positive results with the youth entrusted to the custody of the Ohio DYS.  Our initial \nsite visits were to Scioto and they sparked some hope that DYS might have turned the \ncorner in this area. \nA new Superintendent, Chris Money, the eighth in seven years, is widely admired \nfor her work with adult prisoners and then in the Central Office of DYS.  Her Deputy for \nDirect Services, Nan Hoff, appears wholly committed, not merely to the safety of the \nScioto girls but to helping them.  The majority of the Scioto girls that I interviewed \nindividually and in groups answered yes to the question: Do you feel safe here? \nIn August 1998, acting as consultants to the then Director of DYS, Dr. Jane \nHaddad and I wrote: \n[L]ine staff follow a “control model” rather than a “treatment model” and \nespecially during hours when administrative and clinical staff are not \npresent.  Indeed, we may go further and suggest that staff reliance on force \nexceeds many adult prison systems.  It seems so pervasive that the overall \nnormative culture regimen becomes a rather hollow shell; a contradiction \nquickly absorbed by the youth.  Fred Cohen & Jane Haddad, Ohio \nDepartment of Youth Services Consultative Report, (Aug. 3, 1998)9  \nSome six years later in the Interim Report, I wrote, “We found the unwarranted \nuse of physical force and seclusion to be endemic to Scioto We [including Steve Martin] \nfound countless examples of situations where no force at all should have been used and \nothers where the force used was excessive.” \nThus, while we found essentially no change in this vitally important area over a \nsix-year period, ending in 2004, there is a glimmering of change accompanied by hope, \nfor example, at Scioto in 2007.  While this is hardly cause for celebration, Scioto has at \nleast applied the brakes and begun to inch forward.  For DYS as a whole however, the \n                                                 \n9 The Report was prepared in response to the initiation of a CRIPA investigation by the U.S. Dept. of \nJustice.  The term “normative culture” refers to the DYS’s then in vogue treatment philosophy.  It was \ndifficult to find any staff member who even knew what this treatment approach entailed. \n  23\n\nunwarranted and excessive use of force along with questionable isolation/seclusion \npractices remains of serious concern. \nDirector Stickrath has repeatedly communicated a DYS policy of zero-tolerance \nof staff abuse toward the youth.  New approaches to investigations of staff abuse are \nbeing adopted; training in verbal techniques to manage disputes will soon be complete for \nall staff; volunteers are beginning to saturate the various facilities bringing with them the \npotential for reducing staff violence; supervision on the units is being streamlined; and a \nnew classification system may contribute to a reduction in violence. \nThis Report, of course, is constrained by what team members observed at a \nparticular point in time.  While I credit the good faith commitment of Director Stickrath \nto reverse the embedded “culture of violence,” I believe he would agree that there \nremains “many miles to go.” \nThe November, 2004 Report also noted that we could find no integrated, overall \nmental health plan; only a well rehearsed, verbal adherence to so-called “normative \nculture,” the buzzword for a now abandoned treatment philosophy.  While Scioto clearly \nhas made some progress in the area of a safe environment, neither DYS nor Scioto has \nyet to develop and implement a cohesive, integrated, broadly understood overall \napproach to treatment and rehabilitation.  Scioto however, has at least begun to lay the \ngroundwork for a safe environment and, thereafter, possibly a more viable treatment-\nrehabilitation system. \nA juvenile custodial system might well be safe yet have an ineffective treatment-\nrehabilitation program.  However, it is inconceivable to even imagine an effective \nprogram of treatment-rehabilitation where the youth are afraid; afraid of staff or afraid of \neach other.  At ORV we determined also that staff fear the youth. \nFear at ORV is an all-consuming fire, fueled by the three-dimensional aspects of \nfear: youth fear other youth, youth fear staff, and staff fear youth.  The team expert in use \nof force, Steve Martin, writes in his individual report: \nThere are serious deficiencies in the administration of staff use of force at \nORVJCF.  The deficiencies are so pervasive that youth protection from \nharm by staff use of force is seriously compromised.  Having reviewed \nalmost over 350 incident reports, numerous videos and investigations, in \n  24\n\naddition to two days of on-site work, I believe there is evidence to support \na finding of a pattern and practice of unnecessary and excessive staff use \nof force that can be placed in one of three categories of risks of harm to \nyouths. \na.) unsafe practices that are a product of untrained or ill-trained personnel \nsimply doing their best to manage troublesome youths, e.g., inappropriate \napplication of tactical holds causing injury. \nb.) reckless practices in disregard of obvious risks of harm to youths, e.g., \nchokeholds \nc.) malicious infliction of force on youths, e.g., use of hard impact fist \nstrikes. (Martin, ORV Report, p. 3) \nThis expert’s conclusions will come as no surprise to the DYS administration or \nthe staff at ORV.  During the opening session of our September 13, 2007 site visit, \nSuperintendent Fred Nelson candidly told the Team of his concern with the level of \nviolence and property destruction. \nHe noted that general population youth have serious concerns for their personal \nsafety.  Staff are on “stress leave.”  Mr. Nelson indicated that he has even contacted the \nState Patrol for help. \nIn my at times heated group interview with ORV’s JCO union representatives, \nthey all passionately agreed that they do not receive sufficient training on use of force.  \nWith some minor variations, that complaint was raised in every group discussion I had \nwith union representatives from each facility we visited. \nThe variations included a complaint about a lack of clarity in the “rules of \nengagement” themselves; that is, exactly when is it proper to use force and exactly what \nphysical restraint techniques are permitted under what circumstances.  I will return to this \ntheme, infra. \nMost union representatives adhere to the “just a few bad apples” explanation \nwhen confronted with the observation that there is a pervasive culture of violence in \nDYS.  During my ORV, JCO session, I told the group that I believed they would not be \ncompletely honest with me concerning use of force issues. \n  25\n\nOne officer plainly was offended by that remark and suggested I was being \nsomewhat arrogant. (That may not be the exact term used).  I then slid my legal pad in the \nofficer’s direction and asked that the officer write the names of the “few bad apples” at \nORV. \nSilence. \nMy invitation obviously went unaccepted. The “few bad apples” then, are \nprotected by a code of silence. \nWe talked more easily of group activities having been dropped as too dangerous \nand the dangers of housing 13-year-olds with some 20-year-olds as “crazy.” \nExpert Steve Martin went on to point out that of the six facilities investigated \nORV has the most dysfunctional system in place for controlling staff misuse of force.  \nQuoting again from Steve Martin’s ORV Report: \nThe use of force incident packets often don’t reflect whether incidents \nhave been reviewed, other packets have review forms that are totally \nblank, and some packets contain two separate review forms, neither of \nwhich was complete.  The administrative review doesn’t include a viewing \nof available video unless the incident is referred for investigation.  Neither \nthe DSDS or the OA10 could articulate a reliable set of criteria used to \nconduct their reviews, nor was it clear when they refer an investigation to \nthe CIO.   \nIn addition to a flawed administrative review system, the facility has failed \nto utilize or employ a tracking system to monitor the status of the use of \nforce incidents they refer to local investigators.  Recently, an administrator \ntemporarily assigned from another facility to assist in identifying \nmanagement deficiencies at the facility, found 88 incidents that had been \nassigned to local investigators and had just “piled up” and had not been \ncompleted.  These investigations were forwarded to the CIO11 where they \nwere reviewed to determine which incidents should be investigated locally \nor by the CIO.  The majority of those incidents have been returned for \n                                                 \n10 DSDS is Deputy Superintendent of Direct Services; OA is Operations Administrator. \n11 CIO is Chief Inspectors Office, a Central Office staff position. \n  26\n\nlocal investigation.  It is important to note that the number of use of force \ninvestigations at ORVJCF is disproportionately high compared  (both \nlocal and CIO investigations) to the other DYS facilities.  The \ninvestigations that are completed at the local level are of a very \nquestionable quality, often resulting in facially unreliable findings.  \nFinally, employee sanctions are often inconsistent with the seriousness of \nthe use of force violation(s). (Martin, ORV Report at pp. 3-4) \nWith ORV, along with Marion and Indian River, in the top tier on the use of \nforce, restraints, and isolation, we find that of all the facilities that would benefit from a \nsound system to control misuse of force, ORV may well be the least equipped to do so. \nWe are well aware of the administrative oversight implications inherent in this \nanalysis.  We are also aware of a variety of efforts by Director Stickrath to resolve the \nORV dilemma.  Our investigative task, however, is to describe and analyze what we find \nat a given moment in time and for ORV we find a culture hostile to helping these youth \nand unable or unwilling to properly investigate use of force. \nReaders are referred to the Steve Martin, ORV Report of September 28, 2007, pp. \n5-7 for his incident/investigation summaries.  You will discover delayed investigations, \ncompromised investigations, and in Local Investigation 2007-136 March 23, 2007, where \na JCO was found to have hit a youth four to six times with a closed fist and the facility \nSuperintendent recommended removal from service.  The State Collective Bargaining \nBoard held that the findings did not support removal.12\n                                                 \n12 In Ronald C. Wilson v. ODYS, Case No. 06-REM-04-0214 (Dec. 5, 2007), the Administrative Law Judge \nupheld the decision of ODYS to remove appellant from his position as Operations Manager at Scioto.  \nWilson was found to have escalated a volatile situation leading to the needless restraint of a youth.  In \nanother incident, Wilson used a finger-flex hold on a youth, which resulted in this youth’s wrist being \nbroken. \n  27\n\nRestraints & Isolation13\nThe use of mechanical restraints and room isolation may fairly be dealt with in the \nsame general area as a “Safe Environment.” Physical force and mechanical restraints \nnever may be used for punishment while some forms of limited isolation are legally \nacceptable as punishment in both the adult and juvenile systems.14\nIn general we found that isolation is systematically used too frequently and for \nmuch too long.  Mechanical restraints, however, are rarely used except for two-point \nrestraints used to transport youth.  At Scioto, for example, we could find no record or \nevidence of the use of four-point restraints except a single instance where a girl asked to \nbe so restrained. \nBased on their categorical vulnerability, juveniles have prevailed in court on \nisolation and restraint claims where adults would not have.  See Lollis v. N.Y. State Dept. \nof Social Services, 322 F.Supp.473, 482, 484 (S.D.N.Y. 1970)(voiding the two-week \nconfinement of a 14-year old girl in a bare room with no recreation or reading material \nand finding the use of shackles on a male juvenile in isolation for periods of time ranging \nfrom 40 minutes to two hours impermissible).  See also Nelson v. Heyne, 355 F.Supp. \n451 (D. Ind. 1972)(discussing the right to treatment in conjunction with use of solitary \nconfinement). \nWhile I have elected to treat isolation and restraints as a question of safety, other \ncategorize this area as a constitutional deprivation of liberty.  Relying on an assessment \n                                                 \n13 Restraints refer to a device designed to interfere with the free movement of one’s arms and legs or which \ntotally immobilizes the person (for example, the four-point restraint) and which device must be modified or \ndiscontinued by a third person. \nAnalytically, one may approach the use of mechanical restraints in three different circumstances: (1) point-\nto-point movement within a facility; (2) movement outside the perimeter of a facility, typically to another \ndestination (such as to the hospital, court, prison); and (3) immobilization within the facility. \nVarious forms of mechanical restraints — cuffs and leg irons are the most common — are used when \ntransporting certain inmates, during visits, or when simply moving about the facility. \nThe primary concern in this Report is with category (3), immobilization within the facility.  See Cameron \nv. Tomes, 990 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 1993)(interestingly discussing the transport issue). \nIsolation or seclusion in the DYS system does not he a precise meaning.  In essence, seclusion involves \nplacing a youth alone in his or her own room or a so-called safe room for varying amounts of time. \nYouths also may be placed in a highly restricted cell for as much as 23 hours a day, 7 days a week as part \nof a Special Management Plan that appears to have no durational limit. This more nearly resembles the \npenal isolation found in adult supermax prisons or segregations units. \n14 See Fred Cohen, Isolation in Penal Setting: The Isolation-Restraint Paradigm, 22 Wash. U.J. of Law & \nPolicy 295, 306 et seq. (2006)(Based on testimony before the Commission on Safety & Abuse in Prisons). \n  28\n\nconducted by the San Francisco-based, Youth Law Center, a recent OJJDP-ABA Report \nconcluded: \nRestraints/Isolation. Mechanical restraints and excessive isolation in \njuvenile detention facilities stripped away the juveniles' liberty in violation \nof constitutional due process requirements. The report commented that \n\"our experience in past litigation is that courts are not persuaded by the \nexcuse [that restraints and isolation become necessary because] the mental \nhealth agency has not provided adequate services for, or removed from the \nfacility, emotionally disturbed youth.\" Furthermore, \"an extensive body of \ncase law sets limits on the deprivations to which inmates may be subjected \nin isolation\" and provides due process rights for disciplinary hearings on \ninstitutional rule infractions. (Patricia Puritz & Mary Ann Scali, Beyond \nthe Walls: Improving Conditions of Confinement For Youth in Custody 43 \n(ABA, 1998)) \nWhether approached as an issue of safety or in the more legalistic terms of \ndeprivation of liberty the use of mechanical restraints and physical isolation raise serious \nquestions.  In addition to the universally-endorsed “never for punishment” injunction \nseveral other principles should be articulated: \n1.  The factor of youth itself is a significant limitation on the use of isolation and \nmechanical restraints.  Thus, whatever the legal limitations in this area for adults, \njuveniles have a right to even greater protection. \n2.  The frequency, duration, and rationale for the use of isolation and mechanical \nrestraints are reliable indicators of the extent to which a system, or individual \nfacility is more or less punitive more or less devoted to treatment or rehabilitation. \nExpert Steve Martin, reporting on Scioto writes: \nThe use of isolation and seclusion is governed by at least three separate \nSOP’s: Seclusion, 301.05.03; Special Management Plans, 305.01.01; \nYouth Disciplinary Sanctions, 303.01.02.  The Seclusion SOP identifies \nfour separate categories of seclusion: Extended Seclusion (more than \n24hrs), Seclusion (less than 24hrs), Room Seclusion (less than 1hr), and \nSafe-Room (no time limitations).  The SOP for Youth Disciplinary \n  29\n\nSanctions provides for a period of seclusion up to 5 days.  The SMP SOP \nprovides for seclusion without time limitations.   \nSJCF very frequently uses seclusion pursuant to all three SOP’s.  The \n“Seclusion Summary Report,” (“SS Report”) May 1 through June 30, \n2007, reflects 267 seclusion intervention events totaling 3,485 hours.  The \nbasic seclusion policy, 301.05.03, at Section IV.A.15., provides that \nseclusion is not to be used “beyond 24 hours from the time seclusion was \nimplemented unless the youth behavior is a threat to the safety and \nsecurity of the institution and/or others.”  However, pursuant to SMP’s, \nthe facility is imposing a pre-determined number of hours in seclusion for \nacting out behaviors, see Incidents, ID 5502070733 & 5502070703, in \nwhich one youth “was placed in seclusion for 12 hours per SMP and \nanother in which cursing behavior “warrants an 8 hour seclusion period.”  \nIn discussing this issue with the DSDS it became apparent that the term \n“seclusion” may be applied too broadly at the facility, or rather too \nimprecisely, and may inflate the total number of hours reported.  If for \ninstance, a youth is committed to a term of isolation pursuant to a \ndisciplinary hearing, should this event be reported/recorded as \n“seclusion?”  Further, if a youth is placed in “seclusion” for a \npredetermined number of hours pursuant to a SMP, how should it be \nreported/recorded? [Note: this is aside from the issue of whether such \npredetermined lengths of stay are appropriate.]   It may be that SJCF \nofficials rely too heavily on seclusion as a management practice; however, \nuntil administrators, et al., determine exactly what constitutes “seclusion,” \nand the proper basis for a placement decision, a truly qualitative analysis \nis difficult to complete.  On a final note regarding seclusion, a review of \nthe SSR reflects a small number of the same youths produce a large \nnumber of seclusion interventions.   This same pattern was also evident in \nmy review of use of force incident reports.   (Martin, Scioto Report at \npp.12-13)(The incidents referenced in the text will be found in the full \nReport attached to the Final Report) \n  30\n\nPerhaps the most pernicious form of isolation relates to the Special Management \nPlans (SMP). \nWith reference to Scioto mental health expert, Dr. Leta Smith examined the \nmental health implications of SMP’s, noting: \n[A]ccording to the 2006 SOP 301.05.03 concerning Seclusion, youth \nplaced in seclusion shall be checked visually by staff at least every 15 \nminutes and shall be visited at least once each day by personnel from \nadministrative, clinical, social work, religious, or medical unit. There is no \nseparate seclusion Mental Health policy, and youth are too frequently \nplaced on the POD as part of special management plans and for suicide \nwatch. The Adjustment Pod is teaching youth little to nothing, especially \nwhen time and again Special Management Plans do not provide \nmeaningful opportunities to work toward defined goals related to \nbehaviors and/or to increase recovery. Plans are generally punitive and \nvery similar in structure for different circumstances and behaviors.  \nA review of SMPs for youth recently on the POD provided additional \nclear confirmation that the plans are problematic. These youth are on the \nmental health caseload and taking psychiatric medications.  For all these \nyouth a visit by psychology was the very rare exception. Case #1 provided \nfor a 2-1/2 month plan rather than a plan extending time as necessary, and \nwith no provision for shortening the time. Although the plan called for \ndaily contact from one member of the treatment team professional staff to \nminimize isolation and monitor mental health this was not the case. The \nSMP for youth #2 and youth #3 also included ‘regular’ meetings with \nclinical staff but these too were infrequent, and certainly far from daily. \nYouth #2 and youth #3’s plan called for 8 additional hours of seclusion for \n‘refusing direction.’  There are exceptions as youth #4’s plan is time \nlimited and provides graduated sanction, but again positive incentives are \nvirtually non-existent.  \nStaff need continued training and oversight on using these Special \nManagement Plans for behavioral improvement rather than punishment. \n  31\n\nThey should not routinely include the use of seclusion and need to be time \nlimited, individualized, with graduated punishments, incentives, and \ncarefully monitored and supported by clinical staff.  (Dr. Leta Smith, \nScioto & Marion Site Visits July 31-Aug. 3, 2007, p. 6-7)(Again, the \nyouth plans that are referenced are discussed in some detail in the full \nReport, which is attached.) \nAt ORV, as noted in Section II, I interviewed a 15-year-old youth confined to the \nIntensive Program Unit (IPU).  He had spent four months in this antiseptic, lock-down \nunit that resembled the units and cells at the Ohio State Penitentiary, Ohio’s supermax.  \nThe only difference is the cells at OSP had more furniture (a desk) and every cell has a \ntelevision. \nLevel 1 (Red) involves a minimum two-week, 23-hours a day, 7-dyas a week \nlockdown.  Youth can, and often do, stay at this level well beyond the two weeks.  Meals \nare taken in the cell and out-of-cell movement seems limited to showers. \nAt Level 2, youth are out for one hour of daily recreation, meals are available on \nthe unit outside the cell.   \nLevel 3 involves an hour at the gym, classroom attendance, and a bit more \nfreedom. \nThere is only one social worker on the unit with 20 youth in confinement.  There \nis in practical effect, no treatment whatever.  What goes by the name treatment team (a \nJCO, unit manager, teacher, and social worker) is more like a unilaterally, functioning \nclassification team. \nThe youth is not present on the Monday’s when they meet nor is there any \npsychiatrist.  The Team makes the all-important level decisions and does not review \ntreatment plans or progress. \nThe youth I interviewed conceded that there are fights on the unit, especially at \nLevel 2 and mainly around showers or phone calls.  He was surprisingly calm about his \nsituation; his desire to leave DYS and succeed.  He was most disappointed at not getting \nhelp with his problems and not being pushed with his education.  He wanted to be \nchallenged intellectually and not just vegetate in a secure cell on a secure unit. \n  32\n\nThis youth believed he had an I.Q. of 160.  Something I was unable to verify.  He \nhad some hope in his eyes; he was articulate and, no doubt, hard to manage.  The youth \nhad read all the Harry Potter books and wondered if I could get him some similar books \nto read.  I could only wonder how long that hope would survive, when would he simply \ngive up on a decent future and succumb. \nThe unit itself made an indelible impression with me as bringing to bear the worst \nthat adult corrections has — the supermax/secure segregation unit — to juveniles who \nhave been sent to DYS for treatment and rehabilitation. \nThis use of prolonged isolation under stark conditions, whether in the name of \ntreatment, management, or punishment must be dealt with in the resolution of this \nlitigation.  The current practices simply cannot be sustained. \n \nIncident Reports \nWith regard to Marion, expert Steve Martin reached the same conclusions as to \nuse of force as he found at ORV, finding a similar pattern and practice of unnecessary \nand excessive staff use of force.  Mr. Martin then examined use of force reporting and \nafter reviewing hundreds of recent Marion incident reports he concludes that staff \nfrequently submit reports that are incomplete and/or false. \nQuoting Mr. Martin: \nMoreover, there are incidents of force that are not reported at all.  Reports \nare often conclusory and lack sufficient detail to even determine the nature \nof force used.  Moreover, staff often use terms such as “fight break-up” \nwithout fully describing what they actually did. The following \nrepresentative incidents provide examples of a badly flawed reporting \nsystem at Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility. \nIncident ID–4102070485, June 25, 2007: This is an incident in which a \nJCO kicked a restrained youth in the head multiple times in plain view of \nsix staff members (based on my review of the video that captured the \nentire incident).  None of the JCO witnesses reported the kicks.  A nurse in \nattendance reported that the JCO’s “boot made contact with the left side of \nthe helmet the youth was wearing to prevent him banging his head.”  The \n  33\n\nsingle staff member who accurately reported the incident was the \nOperations Manager (“OM”).  The investigation of this incident did not \naddress any reporting issues. [Note:  at the time of my site inspection, the \ninvestigation had been completed sustaining the allegations against the \nJCO who kicked the youth; however, she remained in a contact position \nsupervising youths at the facility.  The Deputy Superintendent confirmed \nthat the facility is lacking a policy directive as to when staff are prohibited \nfrom working in a contact position during the pendency of an investigation \nof allegations of improper force.] \nIncident ID–4102070455, June 16, 2007: This was an incident in which a \nyouth sustained “a possible separated shoulder” when “fight break-up” \ntactics were used.  Neither of the officer participant reports was \nsufficiently detailed to allow any assessment of the cause of the injury to \nthe youth. \nIncident ID–4102070449, June 14, 2007: This was an incident in which \none officer reported that a Unit Administrator (“UA”) used a “fight break-\nup” tactic on a youth.  The UA reported that he used “Emergency Defense \n& Basic Block” on the youth.  The UOF policy defines Emergency \nDefense as the “highest level of staff response that carries a substantial \nrisk that it shall proximately result in the serious physical harm or the \ndeath of any person.”  There is evidence to suggest that the UA simply \npushed the youth back into his cell; however, the incorrect use of terms in \nthe absence of detailed reporting simply creates serious ambiguity as to \nwhat actually occurred. \nIncident ID–4102070292, May 9, 2007: This was an incident in which a \nyouth sustained a dislocated shoulder.  The two participant/witness \nofficers simply reported a “fight break-up” tactic that provided no \nplausible explanation for the dislocated shoulder.  A youth witness \nreported a chokehold was used. \nIncident ID–4102070487, June 25, 2007: This was an incident in which a \nyouth reported that he was choked by an officer.  A medical exam noted \n  34\n\nthat his “tonsils [were] enlarged.”  The video established that the officer \ndid indeed “wrap his left arm around the neck area” of the youth.  The \nofficer had failed to submit any report of this incident. (Martin, Marion \nReport at pp. 5-6) \nSome of the more egregious use of force situations at Marion involved \nsupervisors directly and improperly participating in the application of force.  This \npractice is objectionable even where the force might be needed and properly applied.  \nThe two disturbing incidents that follow are somewhat more aggravated than others \nreviewed but are nonetheless instructive: \nIncident ID–6020342, April 11, 2006: This was an incident in which \nofficers intervened in a fight between two youths in a classroom.  As the \ntwo youths were escorted through the hallway around other non-involved \nyouths, one of the non-involved youths exchanged words with an OAM \n(one of the supervisors should have secured the hallway prior to the escort \nof the two youths from the area).   As the youth was walking away with \nhis back to the OAM, rather than continue to supervise the dispersal of \nother youths in this potentially volatile situation, the OAM suddenly \nattacked the youth with a chokehold and took him to the ground.   \nNotwithstanding this gratuitous assault on the youth, compounded by his \nfailure to report the incident and his false statements during the course of \nthe investigation, the disciplinary sanction imposed was a 3-day \nsuspension. [Note:  one of the youths involved in the fight had earlier been \ntaken down in the hallway with a chokehold in which a very large officer \nremained on top of the youth until the youth experienced a loss of \nconsciousness.  When the OAM arrived upon this scene, he immediately \nbecame directly involved in the restraint of the now motionless youth.  \nThe medical report indicated the youth had sustained multiple head \ninjuries, was “sluggish to reaction” and was “profusely diaphoretic.” ] \nIncident ID–4102070363, May 26, 2007: This incident involved a youth \nwith an extensive history of mental health problems who was observed \nthreatening to engage in self-harm with a piece of plastic from a scrub \n  35\n\nbrush.  After complying with orders to relinquish the piece of plastic, the \nyouth was cuffed and an UA arrived on the scene to direct his movement \nto a safe room.  The UA was accompanied by multiple staff, including no \nless than four officers.  A decision was made to strip the youth15 and place \nhim in a suicide smock.  Rather than supervise staff, the UA took the \ndiminutive youth to the floor and straddled him with her considerable \nbody weight.  Thus began an excruciatingly long application of force in \nwhich the UA continued her direct involvement and failed to prevent other \nstaff from repeatedly engaging in tactics that created extreme risks of \nharm to the youth.  In reviewing the video of this incident, I observed \nmultiple instances in which the youth was placed in positions commonly \nassociated with in-custody deaths from positional asphyxia.  In a \nremarkable display of reckless force tactics, one officer attempted to place \nthe suicide smock on the youth’s head as a make shift spit-mask (see \nIncident ID-4102070448, in which a shirt was used on a cuffed youth as a \nmake shift spit-mask).  In another instance, an officer can be seen with his \nfull body weight on the youth’s back with his knee across the youth’s \nneck.  The decision was then made to place the youth in 2-point restraints.  \nNotwithstanding that the youth was cooperating with staff and even trying \nto assist them in securing the restraints, they were unable to secure the \nrestraints in a proper and timely fashion. [Note: In my considerable \nexperience reviewing use of force videos, I have rarely viewed an incident \nthat more graphically exemplifies the reckless risk of harm that may be \nvisited on a subject by ill-trained personnel.  It is not idle conjecture to \nsuggest this youth could have been fatally injured.  Finally, while I have \nnot conducted a full analysis of this event, I believe it is questionable as to \nwhether the initial use of force that precipitated the protracted application \nof force was even necessary.]  (Martin, Marion Report at pp. 7-8) \n                                                 \n15 Several youths in the group this writer interviewed reported that JCO’s “rip off our clothes and throw us \nin our rooms.”  How common this might be and under what circumstances is not known. \n  36\n\nHaving viewed the same video I will state in even stronger terms, there was no \nneed for the application of any force.  The frail youth was standing alone in a safe cell, \nsubdued, and no immediate danger to himself or anyone else.  Staff had only to remain at \nthe open door, observe the youth, and he would eventually have disclosed the implement \nhe used to scratch/cut his arms.  \nBeyond this critique on use of force is the total absence of a clinical presence or \nresponse to this incident involving a seriously mentally ill youth.  DYS staff view the \n“cutting” as open to a disciplinary charge of “creating an institutional hazard.” (The \nyouth’s blood, I am told, might create an infectious disease potential.) \nSurely this is an event (cutting) in which to intervene and to provide needed \nmedical care for these superficial wounds.  Just as surely this is a mental health event \ncalling for a clinical presence and involvement in de-escalation tactics and then \nsupportive therapy.  We, in turn, are constrained to report the event in its crudest, most \nprimitive terms: unnecessary and life-threatening, use of force plus the involvement of a \nUA. \nThe administrative reporting and review process here also is flawed beginning \nwith often deficient reports and an absence of identified criteria by which to conduct \nreviews.  There is no routine examination of video evidence. \nThe use of seclusion and isolation at Marion illustrates some important system-\nwide issues.  Marion makes frequent use of seclusion.  However, the Seclusion Summary \nReports do not include isolation imposed pursuant to the youth disciplinary system; \nyouths placed on the IPU (this includes the “23/7” room or cell confinement for the first \ntwo weeks); and the “lockdown” of youth who are disruptive at school. \nThe Marion Seclusion Summary Report for May 1 – June 30, 2007 identifies 268 \nseclusion events, with 25% of these involving just three youth.  All three also are over-\nrepresented in use of force incidents and have histories of mental health problems.16\nOur findings on use of force at Indian River regrettably mirror those for ORV and \nMarion.  To quote directly from expert Steve Martin: \nThere are serious deficiencies in the administration of staff use of force at \nIRJCF.  The deficiencies are so pervasive that youth protection from harm \n                                                 \n16 We uncovered no significant problems in the use of mechanical restraints at Marion. \n  37\n\nby staff use of force is seriously compromised.  Having reviewed almost \n500 incident reports, numerous videos and investigations, in addition to \ntwo days of on-site work, I believe there is evidence to support a finding \nof a pattern and practice of unnecessary and excessive staff use of force. . . \nThe patterns and practices seen at IRJCF are not unlike those seen at \nvirtually all the facilities subject to our inspection.  While there are \ncertainly differences and variances in the magnitude of particular \ndeficiencies at IRJCF vis-a-vis other facilities, the cumulative deficiencies \nacross all issues subject to my review result in the same findings of \npervasive risks of harm to the youths confined at IRJCF.     \nUse of force reports are often lacking in detail, contain conclusory \nstatements, and in some cases, are not even filed by all participants or \nwitnesses.  Supervisors are too often applying force rather than \nmanaging/overseeing an incident.  Administrative reviews are not \nsystematically conducted to include video reviews nor is identifiable \ncriteria consistently applied in making investigative referrals.  \nInvestigations are generally of a poor quality and are not conducted with \nthe degree of impartiality necessary to yield reliable findings.  Finally, \nemployee disciplinary sanctions are often too lenient, reduced in their \nseverity without a sound evidentiary basis, or not imposed at all. (Martin, \nIndian River Report at pp. 3-4) \nReaders are advised to consult the representative five summaries of incidents and \ninvestigations contained in the aforementioned Martin Report. You will discover false \nand misleading statements by staff; dubious, if not simply unbelievable investigations and \nreports, avoidable physical injuries inflicted on youth; and staff actions and reactions that \neither initiated or accelerated a confrontational situation. \nFor the May-July period, there were 818 intervention events at Indian River \ntotaling 26, 204 hours as compared to Mohican that totaled 2,874 hours for the same time \nperiod.  Indian River had 143 youths who each spent 72 or more hours in seclusion \ntotaling 17,271 hours as compared to Mohican who placed four youths in seclusion for \nmore than 72 hours each totaling 383 hours.  A large number of the seclusion hours for \n  38\n\nthis time period can be attributed to a program initiated by the superintendent in May \n2007 intended to reduce/manage high levels of violence and disruption occurring at the \nfacility. \nYouths who were engaging in disruptive conduct were isolated on one particular \nunit and single celled for program participation similar to the questionable Intensive \nProgramming Units at the Marion and Ohio River Valley facilities.  While the program \nreduced the violence in the general population, it increased significantly on the unit to \nwhich the disruptive youths were housed.  The superintendent abandoned the program in \nAugust due to her concerns over the number of youths being held in virtual “lock-up” on \nthe unit.   \nEven discounting the seclusion hours attributed to Operation Fresh Start, Indian \nRiver seclusion hours remain high.  Steve Martin’s review of incident reports for the \nperiod showed that seclusion is often used for punishment without utilizing the formal \nyouth disciplinary sanction process.   \nWhen a youth is given seclusion time pursuant to the disciplinary process, he may \nappeal the sanction which cannot be served until the appeal is resolved by central office.  \nIt can often be weeks until the appeal is processed; thus, the youth serves the time far \nremoved from the violation itself.  Facility officials understandably believe that the \npunitive value of seclusion is undermined for two reasons.  First, such punishment is \nmost effective if it is imposed close in time to the violation.  Second, if the youth has \nmade positive adjustment since the violation, to place him in punitive seclusion weeks \nafter the event can undermine his now positive adjustment. \nIn Steve Martin’s discussions with the OA on the Seclusion Summary Report it \nbecame apparent that it needs to be audited both by facility and central office officials.  \nFor instance, some facilities include disciplinary seclusion on the Seclusion Summary \nReport but Indian River doesn’t.  Indian River’s report was replete with entries in which \n“Room Seclusion” exceeded the one-hour time limit imposed by the seclusion policy yet \nno official had questioned these apparent violations of policy.   The Seclusion Summary \nReport provides extremely valuable information to both facility and central office \nofficials in terms of oversight; however, it simply is not being utilized at either level to \nmonitor this issue throughout the system. \n  39\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the vast majority of youths placed in seclusion at \nIndian River are placed in their assigned room. When a youth is placed in seclusion in a \ndouble cell situation, during the waking hours the bedding for both youths is removed \nwhich penalizes the non-involved youth.  Each housing hallway has a wet cell that is \nused when a youth is given seclusion pursuant to a disciplinary hearing.  \nWith regard to the Circleville and Mohican facilities we found that while there \nwere isolated instances of questionable use of force there is no pattern or practice of harm \ninflicted on youth confined there. \nAt Circleville, for July-August 2007, there were 30 interventions with any kind of \nphysical force, the lowest total for all six facilities visited.  By way of contrast, Marion’s \ntotals for a recent two-month period were 272. \nMohican was determined to be the facility where the review process most often \nresulted in predictable and systematic referrals for investigation.  Mohican also strictly \nfollows the review process required by the SOP on point whereas Marion and Indian \nRiver do not appear to use the appropriate form. \nThis, of course, suggests a flaw in the Central Office oversight/auditing of the \nadministrative review process. \nInterestingly, where the review of use of force is faithfully and systematically \ndone, we also find no serious pattern or practice of either unnecessary or excessive use of \nforce. \nCircleville uses seclusion less frequently and for briefer periods than the other \nfive facilities visited.  Over 91% of the seclusion events are for less than eight hours in \nduration with 70% less than four hours. \nOver a recent, three-month period, only five events resulted in seclusion for over \n36 hours and the incident reports show that serious misbehavior precipitated the event. \nMohican, on the other hand, makes more frequent use of isolation, although 76% \nare for zero-four hours in duration.  By way of contrast, Indian River averaged 32 hours, \nScioto 13 hours, and Marion eight hours.  Even so, the Superintendent at Mohican \ndeveloped a survey instrument to determine whether youth seek seclusion to be alone and \nto determine if a designated area versus a locked room might be a more appropriate \napproach. \n  40\n\nFour-point restraints at Mohican and Circleville appear to be rarely applied.  \nMohican rarely uses any kind of restraints and when applied, they are used in conjunction \nwith a Special Management Plan. \nAs a general proposition, where isolation and seclusion raise significant questions \nand present challenges for reform, the DYS system does not appear to make excessive, \ninappropriate or harmful use of mechanical restraints. \nIt is important, however, that training continue in this area emphasizing when and \nhow to use two- and four-point restrains and the special procedural and monitoring issues \nrelated to immobilizing youth with mental illness. \n \nSelect Use Of Force Incidents \nEnclosed with this Report is a DVD that contains several select” use of force” \nincidents that were witnessed by team member Steve Martin.  What follows is a narrative \nto accompany and enhance your understanding of the events portrayed on the DVD. \nWe request that the court keep the DVD under seal and that counsel not disclose \nthe DVD in order to protect the privacy of the youth. \n \n1). Scioto Incident, March 9, 2007:  This incident involved a female youth who \nhad recently engaged in self-injurious behavior (inflicting wounds with paper \nclips/writing instruments).  She pushed past staff to get out of her room on the Buckeye \nUnit. A JCO employed a chokehold as a takedown technique.  Immediately after the \ntakedown two staff members can be seen recklessly yanking and pulling on the youth’s \nlegs. The JCO continued to place his body weight on the youth while continuing the \nchokehold. In the presence of an OM, the JCO was allowed to continue this dangerous \nposition for an extended period of time, actually hindering the application of restraints, \nand causing the youth to repeatedly scream and hysterically plea to be released from the \nchokehold.  None of the incident reports referenced the chokehold.  Various reports \ndescribed her as “very combative” after the takedown when in fact she was likely \nstruggling as a result of air hunger or suffocation panic.  This incident was not referred \nfor any follow-up inquiry or investigation.  There is no evidence that the video was ever \nreviewed in concert with the incident packet.   \n  41\n\n2. Marion Incident, May 26, 2007: This incident involved a youth with an \nextensive history of mental health problems who was observed threatening to engage in \nself-harm with a piece of plastic from a scrub brush.  After complying with orders to \nrelinquish the piece of plastic, the youth was cuffed and an UA arrived on the scene to \ndirect his movement to a safe room.  The UA was accompanied by multiple staff, \nincluding no less than four officers.  A decision was made to strip the youth and place \nhim in a suicide smock.  Rather than supervise staff, the UA took the diminutive youth to \nthe floor and straddled him with her considerable body weight.  Thus began an \nexcruciatingly long application of force in which the UA continued her direct \ninvolvement and failed to prevent other staff from repeatedly engaging in tactics that \ncreated extreme risks of harm to the youth.   \nIn viewing this video it should be noted that there were multiple instances in \nwhich the youth was placed in positions commonly associated with in-custody deaths \nfrom positional asphyxia.  He remained in a face-down prone position much too long.   In \na remarkable display of reckless force tactics, one officer attempted to place the suicide \nsmock on the youth’s head as a make shift spit-mask which clearly impaired his air \npassage ways.  An officer can be seen with his full body weight on the youth’s back with \nhis knee across the youth’s neck with the suicide smock over his airways.  The youth \nactually screams that he can’t breathe.   \nThe decision was then made to place the youth in 2-point restraints.  \nNotwithstanding that the youth was cooperating with staff and even trying to assist them \nin securing the restraints, they were unable to secure the restraints in a proper and timely \nfashion.  It should be noted that 2-point wrist-to-wrist restraints (ambulatory restraints) \nare designed for the wrists to be cuffed to the side-front of the body.  In the video, it is \nclear that officers are attempting to cuff in the side-back with his arms turned backwards \ngreatly increasing the risk of fractures to his arms/shoulders.  After abandoning the first \nset of restraints, the officers persist in cuffing the youth in the same dangerous fashion.  It \nshould also be noted that the extraordinary length of time to make either set of restraints \navailable greatly increased the risks of harm to both the youth and staff. \n3. Marion Incident, June 25, 2007: This is an incident in which a JCO can be seen \nkicking the fully restrained youth in the head multiple times in plain view of six staff \n  42\n\nmembers.  After the JCO had been physically pulled away from assaulting the youth, all \nstaff then exited the room leaving the youth alone with the offending JCO. The JCO \nremained in the room alone with the youth for at least ten minutes.   \nNone of the JCO witnesses later reported the kicks.  A nurse in attendance \nreported that the JCO’s “boot made contact with the left side of the helmet the youth was \nwearing to prevent him banging his head.”  The single staff member who accurately \nreported the incident was the Operations Manager (“OM”).  The investigation of this \nincident did not address any reporting issues. [Note:  at the time of my site inspection, the \ninvestigation had been completed sustaining the allegations against the JCO who kicked \nthe youth; however, she remained in a contact position supervising youths at the facility.  \nThe Deputy Superintendent confirmed that the facility is lacking a policy directive as to \nwhen staff are prohibited from working in a contact position during the pendency of an \ninvestigation of allegations of improper force.] \n  43\n\nIV.  MENTAL HEALTH CARE:  TREATMENT, REHABILITATION & \nPROGRAMMING \n \nDr. Leta Smith in beginning her Summary Report of Initial Site Visits 1 (October \n7, 2007) states, “Overall the provision of mental health care and treatment throughout \nODYS is fundamentally deficient and structurally inadequate in design and function.”  \nApart from the often heroic efforts of isolated mental health care providers — certainly \nincluding Dr. Julie Neidermeyer — we could find no strength upon which to comment or \nbuild.  There has been a flurry of corrective plans and some action in this area, at least at \nScioto and Marion, but it came after our field investigation and too late to materially \ninfluence our general observations. \nIn our Interim Report of 2004 at pp. 27-31 we found that there were virtually no \nproactive mental health services; individualized treatment plans were lacking, along with \nproper documentation and a continuum of care.  There was no mental health unit, except \nin name. \nScioto, at best, provided crisis care and yet the then Clinical Services Director, \nbelieved that mental health care was good.  The then Director of DYS asked me to \nprepare a “Mental Health Program” for reforming mental health care, which I did.  (See \nAppendix E).  That program was never even commented upon by any DYS official.  \nThere are a number of initiatives in place, described in an Addendum to this Section but \nwe were unable to detect a measurable impact during the course of this investigation. \nKathy Burns, M.D., a highly regarded forensic psychiatrist, was asked to visit \nonly Scioto and Marion.  Dr. Burns found that the very basics of fundamental mental \nhealth are lacking.  This echoes Dr. Smith’s finding, it echoes the findings in the Interim \nReport, and it echoes my individual conclusions based on our current investigation.  The \nDYS officials in charge of mental health and rehabilitation cannot claim ignorance.  I \nhave been sounding the alarm now for about 10 years. \nPlease note that this investigation and Report does not confront mental health and \nrehabilitative care at the level of a debate e.g., on treatment modalities, efficacy studies, \nbed utilization studies, the formulary, and so on.  Those are matters to be dealt with in the \ncontext of even a dimly outlined system of care, a system we find lacking. \n  44\n\nThe overall mental health caseload is roughly 25% to 35% of all DYS youth and \nthat is low compared with other states and the available incidence data \nIn constructing a Model for dealing with the identification and treatment of youth \ninvolved with the juvenile justice system, Skowyra and Cocozza conducted the most \ncomprehensive study to date: 1,437 youth in three different states in three different types \nof juvenile justice settings detention, corrections, and community-based programs. \nThe results of the study, which were incorporated into the Model, confirmed that, \nregardless of level of care or geographic region of the country, the majority of youth in \nthe juvenile justice system meet criteria for at least one mental health diagnosis. Overall, \n70.4% of youth were diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder, with girls \nexperiencing a higher rate of disorders (81%) when compared to males (66.8%).  For \nmany of the youth in the study, their mental health status was complicated by the \npresence of more than one disorder.  Of those youth who were diagnosed with a mental \nhealth disorder, 79.1% met the criteria for at least one other mental health diagnosis.  The \nmajority of youth who met criteria for a mental health diagnosis were also diagnosed with \na co-occurring substance use disorder.  Among those youth with at least one mental \nhealth diagnosis, approximately 60% also met criteria for a substance use disorder.17\nThere is a stunning difference between this latest study and the Ohio caseload \neven allowing for the contingency that caseload figures may not completely reflect \ndiagnostic and off-caseload care.  It is not hyperbole to state that the Ohio DYS, like all \nsimilar state agencies, is a proxy mental health agency.  That being said, the need for \nfundamental change is — and has been — painfully obvious. \n  To the extent that one accepts significant system-wide underdiagnosis and \ntreatment, the consequences are broad and severe.  Delayed treatment means needless \nsuffering and preventable deterioration, the essence of Cruel and Unusual Punishment; \nself-harm and harm to others; inappropriate and harmful punishment for acting out \nbehavior driven by mental illness; needless isolation and its multiple, harmful \nconsequences; and, too often, the enhancement of self-loathing linked to self-destructive \nbehavior. \n                                                 \n17 Kathleen R. Skowyra & Joseph J. Cocozza, Blueprint for Change: A comprehensive Model for the \nIdentification and Treatment of Youth with Mental Health Needs in Contact with the Juvenile Justice \nSystem, p.IX (National Center for Mental Health & Juvenile Justice, 2007). \n  45\n\nWhether a class member’s right to treatment and rehabilitation is framed in terms \nof Due Process or Cruel and Unusual Punishment, our findings on the inadequacy of the \nsystem and the consequent harm will meet either a denial of a Due Process liberty interest \nor deliberate indifference to a serious mental disorder. \nAlexander S. v. Boyd, 876 F.Supp. 773, 796 (D.S.C. 1995), is perhaps the most \nrecent significant affirmative federal decision on behalf of juveniles’ rights to various \nforms of care.  The court specifically looked to the purpose of the juvenile court and \nfound that Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1983), required that children receive \ntraining that provides them with a reasonable opportunity to accomplish the purpose of \ntheir confinement, to protect the safety of the juveniles and the staff, and to ensure the \nsafety of the community once the juveniles are ultimately released. \nAlexander S. determined that minimally adequate programs and services are \nconstitutionally required and are to be designed to teach juveniles the basic principles that \nare essential to correcting their conduct.  These generally recognized principles include: \n(1) taking responsibility for the consequences of their actions; (2) learning appropriate \nways of responding to others (coping skills); (3) learning to manage their anger; and (4) \ndeveloping a positive sense of accomplishment.  ODYS officials indicate an existing \ncommitment to these principles. \nThis ruling is interesting for two other reasons.  First, unlike the court in \nYoungberg, the Alexander S. court envisioned training or treatment in relation to the \noutside world, not solely in relation to life inside the institution.  Second, in no right to \ntreatment case with which I am familiar before Alexander S. did a judge articulate the \npurpose of treatment.  While there is frequent talk about the need for treatment or \nrehabilitation, and many authorities set forth the techniques by which it should be done, \nnone grapple with the elusive, qualitative goals of treatment and none clearly defines \nrehabilitation or attempts to distinguish treatment from rehabilitation. \nAlexander S., then confirmed a right to treatment on behalf of the juveniles in the \ncustody of the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice and perhaps unwittingly did \nso in a fashion that enlarged the disease-oriented concept of treatment to include the \nbroader concept of rehabilitation.  \n  46\n\nJudge Alexander did link South Carolina’s statutory commitment to rehabilitation \n— much like Ohio’s — to the constitutional duties he articulated.  See Alexander S., 875 \nF.Supp. at 795-800 for a discussion of applicable constitutional standards, settling on the \nDue Process Clause.  \nMiller v. Natalucci-Persichetti, 1992 WL 1258522 (S.D. Ohio) concluded that a \njuvenile who is committed to a correctional, as opposed to a mental health institution, has \na right to treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Judge Rice focused on Ohio law \nand the absence of procedural safeguards which parallel those in a criminal proceeding.  \nThe court appeared to accept the fact that the juvenile involved in this case, and who \ncommitted suicide in a juvenile facility, had severe emotional problems.  Thus, this is not \na decision finding a broad-based right to treatment; only the relatively easy finding that \ninvoluntary custody in a government facility requires treatment of serious illnesses.   \nIt is my view of the law on point that all juveniles who are involuntarily confined \nhave at least the same right to mental health treatment as pretrial detainees and prison \ninmates.  Indeed, I feel certain that is the current state of the law. What is it that the \nhedge-term “at least” may encompass?  \nSimply , being young — an adolescent —  should be a powerful factor in \ndetermining the precise application of due process to a juvenile’s claim to adequate \nmental health care for serious mental health needs.  Deliberate indifference, if that is to \nbe the test, should be informed by the knowledge we now have concerning adolescent \ncognitive, intellectual, emotional, social, and moral development.  \nThe general acceptance of a need for early detection and intervention and of a \nvery high incidence of emotional and mental disorders among youth in official custody \nshould become benchmarks for the duty of care evaluated as a part of deliberate \nindifference analysis.  Early detection means one thing for an adult; for a young person it \nincludes early in life as well as early in onset. \nWhat follows is a slightly redacted version of the Report prepared by Dr. Kathy \nBurns after her site visits to Scioto and Marion.18  DYS’s problems begin at the front \ndoor during reception at Scioto and then pervade the entire system; understaffed, lacking \n                                                 \n18 Dr. Burns’ September 27, 2007 Report is so comprehensive and yet succinct that I see no point in \nparaphrasing from it.  This Report, then, will not also appear in the Appendix since the redaction relates \nonly to procedural-type matters.   \n  47\n\ncoherence and direction, lacking leadership, lacking the rudiments of legally mandated \nmental health care and basic rehabilitation efforts. \n \nScioto & Marion Report: Kathryn A. Burns, MD, MPH, 9/27/2007 \n* * * * \nScioto Juvenile Correctional Facility  \nScioto Juvenile Correctional Facility serves as the reception center \nfor both males and females entering ODYS.  Boys stay at the facility for \nthe reception and classification process and are transferred out to their \nassigned institutions within 30 days.  There are approximately 200 boys at \nScioto at any given time.  Scioto is the only ODYS facility for girls.  It \nserves as both reception center and parent institution for girls.  There are \napproximately 90 girls at Scioto.  The mental health program consists of \nreception screening and assessment for both boys and girls and outpatient, \nincluding crisis intervention, and residential treatment for girls.  The \nresidential treatment unit for girls at Scioto is analogous to the Intensive \nMental Health Unit at Marion for boys.   \nMental Health Services for Boys at Scioto:  Reception Screening & \nAssessment \nWhen boys arrive at Scioto, they are seen within the first hour of \narrival by medical nurses who screen for physical health issues, immediate \nmental health needs and psychotropic medication history.  Two medical \nnurses are assigned to the reception process for boys.  They are located in \na small office/examination room inside the building that is used for \nreception.  Medical nurses refer to the psychiatrist(s) based upon a youth’s \ncurrent or past psychotropic medication history.  Currently prescribed \nmedications are discussed with the psychiatrist on site and ordered by the \nmedical nurses to prevent any lapses in medication.  Non-emergency \nreferrals are scheduled to be seen by the psychiatrist within a few days of \narrival.  Emergency referrals for mental health are seen by the psychology \nstaff assigned to reception.  (Depending on the nature of the crisis, if a \n  48\n\npsychiatrist is on site at the facility, he or she will see the emergency \nreferrals in the reception area or can be contacted via telephone to provide \nconsultation and medication orders as necessary.) \n  Psychology staff assigned to reception score the arriving youths’ \nMAYSI-2, review the documentation accompanying the boys and conduct \nindividual standardized interviews with each boy within the first two \nweeks of arrival.  No further psychological or psychometric testing is \nroutinely conducted; some intelligence testing is completed in rare \ninstances.  The purpose of the psychological assessment appears to be to \narrive at an appropriate housing disposition and institutional classification \nand not for mental health treatment.  Psychology staff in this area rarely \nmake recommendations for treatment beyond placement on a watch or \nexpedited transfer to an “intensive” or “non-intensive” mental health unit \nbelieving that their role is simply to compile information for eventual \ntreatment providers further downstream as the boys are shipped out to \ntheir permanent/parent institution within 30 days.  In fact, one Ph.D. level \npsychology assistant who has been working in reception for several \nmonths (and was at the institution previously as well) said she did not \neven know how to make a referral to psychiatry, assuming that if it was \nneeded, the medical nurses would already have done so.  Mental health \nstaffing levels do not allow for the provision of treatment during the \nreception phase except for psychotropic medication, psychiatric \nassessment/follow-up and crisis intervention as needed.   \nMental Health Staffing  \n  At the time of the August site visit, mental health staffing levels \nconsisted of one licensed psychologist and three psychological assistants \nfor boys’ reception in addition to some adult psychiatry contract hours.  \nAs previously noted, this level of staffing provided for boys’ reception \npermits nothing in the way of treatment beyond on-going prescription of \npsychotropic medication and expedited transfer to another facility if \nadditional care is needed. \n  49\n\n  Mental health services for girls (reception, general outpatient, \ncrisis intervention and residential treatment) are provided by one full time \npsychologist and one 25 hours per week psychologist, two psychology \nassistants, 2 licensed (but not independently licensed) social workers, one \npsychiatric nurse and some psychiatric hours provided by adult \npsychiatrists on contract from Ohio State University (OSU.)  As in the \ncase with services for boys at Scioto, girls’ mental health services are \nprofoundly understaffed given the prevalence and severity of mental \ndisorders present in the population as well as the diversity of missions at \nthe facility (reception, classification, multiple security levels in the same \ninstitution, education, outpatient mental health care, crisis intervention, \nresidential mental health care, medical operations, etc.) in addition to there \nbeing  no access to an inpatient level of psychiatric care for girls so that \neven the most acute conditions are managed on-site!   The lone psychiatric \nnurse serves as a liaison from all areas of the institution to the contract \npsychiatrists and assures that boys and girls are scheduled to be seen by \nthe psychiatrists in a timely manner, that they receive prescribed \npsychotropic medications as ordered and without lapses and that all \npsychiatric orders are implemented.  There is little to no time whatsoever \navailable to do any sort of medication education or other psychiatric \nnursing intervention.  Further, the psychiatric nurse serves many clerical \nfunctions in that there are no clerical positions for the mental health \nprogram at Scioto. \n  There are approximately 34 hours per week of psychiatric time at \nScioto split among boys’ reception (approximately 20 hours), girls’ \noutpatient and residential mental health treatment unit.  Three psychiatrists \nprovide these hours – none of them are Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists \n(CAP).  When queried about whether or not this was believed to be a \nproblem, the “chief” or “main” OSU/ODYS psychiatrist said that most of \nthe kids were older adolescents/young adults rather than children and so \ndidn’t consider the lack of CAP training to be a problem.  While \n  50\n\nchronologically, I cannot argue with her rationale, I strongly believe that \nthese kids are psychologically and emotionally quite immature and that at \nleast some psychiatric time or consultation by a CAP is extremely and \nurgently important. \nPsychological and social services staffing levels for girls do not \npermit regular, individual (or group) on-going focused therapy because of \nthe frequency and urgency of crisis interventions and multiple daily \nmental health watch risk assessments.  At least one girl at Scioto had been \non a 1:1 watch every day, 24-hours per day, continuously for more than \ntwo months at the time of the August site visit.  Others had been on and \noff watches for shorter, but still extraordinarily long periods of time. \nGirls’ Residential Mental Health Unit (Special Needs Unit)  \n  The girls’ Special Needs Unit at Scioto is a 14 bed residential \nhousing unit for severely mentally ill girls.  It also contains an additional \napproximately 5 rooms behind a walled off area of the unit where mental \nhealth watches can be conducted in an area that is near, yet apart from and \nquieter than the rest of the unit.  As with the boys’ Intensive Mental \nHealth Unit, the admission, discharge and continued stay criteria for the \ngirls’ Special Needs Unit are unclear in existing DYS policy and \nprocedures.  None of these decisions appear to be functions of the \npsychiatrists, although their input is considered.  Similarly, programming \nand treatment expectations are non-specific.  However, most of the girls \nhoused on the unit appeared at the time of the site visit did appear to suffer \nfrom significant mental health problems which included a high prevalence \nof self-injurious and suicidal behavior. \nStaffing levels to manage a unit of this size and acuity were \nwoefully inadequate.  There was essentially no mental health group \nprogramming.  Social workers conducted some groups although these \nhave not historically been considered mental health interventions; they are \nnot documented in the mental health file nor necessarily part of the mental \nhealth treatment plan which is developed by psychology staff independent \n  51\n\nof other disciplines.  Individual mental health interventions are primarily \ncrisis interventions.  There is little or no time for routine, regular, on-going \nfocused psychotherapy.  Mental health care is essentially “on demand” \nthrough verbalizing intent to harm oneself or actually engaging in self-\ninjurious behavior.  Although there was some training for staff on the use \nof Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) several years ago, it is not \nutilized for reasons that are not clear given the population at Scioto and \nDBT’s demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of borderline personality \ncharacteristics including self-injury.   \nGirls in the mental health unit and in the watch area can be placed \non some level of individual observation for periods of days, weeks or even \nmonths, without a clear behavioral or other plan to intensify or otherwise \nmodify treatment interventions to get them off watch and back into routine \nactivities.  This continues to reinforce the notion that the way to get \nattention is to threaten or actually harm oneself because staff have no time \nto see anyone else.  It further diverts already scarce staff resources away \nfrom on-going, regular and perhaps prophylactic treatment of others.  \n**** \nMental Health Treatment \nAt the time of the site visit, 47 girls (approximately 50% of the \nfemale population) and 26 boys (13%) were prescribed psychotropic \nmedications.  These prevalence rates are substantially lower than we \nexpected and as reported in some other prevalence studies conducted in \njuvenile correctional populations.  The screening and referral processes \nboth at the time of reception and thereafter raise enough questions to call \nfor closer scrutiny during the remediation phase of S.H. \nBoys in reception receive little mental health treatment beyond \npsychotropic medication and individual psychiatric follow-up \nappointments.  Psychological staff conduct a type of reception assessment \nbut it appears to be aimed at arriving at an appropriate classification and \n  52\n\nplacement decision rather than designed for assessing (and then \naddressing) mental health treatment needs.     \nAs was the case for boys on the mental health caseload at Marion, \nthe girls on the mental health caseload receive parallel rather than \nintegrated care by the various staff involved.  Mental health treatment \nplans, if present, are developed unilaterally by psychology staff without \never having treatment team meetings.  There are three other types of \nmeetings at Scioto during which mental health information is discussed, \nbut none of them are actual mental health treatment team/treatment \nplanning meetings.  There are “Psychiatry Team Meetings” conducted \nweekly in which one psychiatrist and psychology staff meet to discuss \ngirls prescribed psychotropic medications.  These meetings are not \ndocumented and the patient does not attend.  There are “Clinical Team \nMeetings” during which psychology staff, the unit manager and social \nworker meet to discuss the mental health caseload.  These are not \ndocumented and neither the psychiatrist nor the patient attends.  There are \n“Interdisciplinary Team Meetings” that are meetings of psychology staff, \nunit staff, social workers, juvenile correctional officers, educational and \nrecreational staff during which individual girls are discussed and also \ninvited to participate.  The psychiatrist is not included.  These meetings \nare documented – but not in the mental health file.  Subsequently, it is not \na surprise that mental health interventions are parallel rather than \nintegrated and this is reflected in the documentation plan:  psychiatric \nassessments, follow-up notes and medication information are contained in \nthe youth’s medical file while psychology notes are contained in the \n“Psychological File.” Psychological files are maintained in the psychology \nstaff offices and are not provided to the psychiatrist when he or she is \nseeing cases.  Each youth also has a social services file which could \ncontain additional mental health information.  Additionally, psychology \nnotes and social service notes are in the process of being entered into \nMicrosoft Access Databases.  At the present time therefore, there are three \n  53\n\npaper files and two electronic files containing mental health information \nfor each youth.  Due to the ODYS interpretation of confidentiality rules \nand protected health information, not all disciplines have access to all of \nthese multiple files at the present time. \n  As previously mentioned, psychological interventions are \nfrequently limited to crisis interventions due to the paucity of staff \navailable to provide any on-going type of treatment as well as the acuity \nlevel of the girls on the Special Needs Unit.  Essentially no psychological \ntesting for diagnostic clarification, assessment or any other use of \nstandardized, objective instruments to monitor response to treatment are \nutilized.  Mental health staff at Scioto are looking forward to the adoption \nof a trauma-informed care treatment model department-wide as planned \nby Central Office Mental Health administrative staff.  Presently, \nessentially all mental health treatment provided is via individual sessions \nwith the psychiatrist or a psychologist; there is no group treatment and \nthere is no unifying model of psychotherapeutic intervention at the \ninstitution.   \nThe psychotropic medication formulary is unrestricted and all \nclasses of medications are available.  The frequency of psychiatric follow-\nup is approximately monthly, more frequently in reception given the short \nstays there.  The psychiatrists work with the lone psychiatric nurse and are \nable to schedule youths more frequently than monthly based upon clinical \nneed.  Laboratory studies and monitoring for potential physical health \ncomplications from the use of psychotropic medications are appropriate \nand timely.  The psychiatrists generally obtain verbal informed consent \nfrom a parent or guardian via telephone discussion when a child is under \nage 18.  This is documented in the medical paper file.  Informed consent \ndocuments are also mailed to parents for signature and return.  As was the \ncase at Marion, prescription of stimulant medications for treatment of \nADHD was extremely conservative, substituting use of Clonidine, atypical \nantipsychotics and mood stabilizing medications.   \n  54\n\n   Access to psychiatric inpatient care is not available unless a youth \nis 18 years old and can be hospitalized in an adult state psychiatric \nhospital.  This is a grave and unacceptably dangerous situation. \n \nMarion Juvenile Correctional Facility  \n  Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility is one of two “close \nsecurity” facilities operated by ODYS and houses only adolescent boys.  \nClose security is the highest security level in the ODYS system.  The \naverage daily population at Marion is approximately 275.  Most residents \nat the facility are transferred from the reception process at Scioto Juvenile \nCorrectional Facility although some transfer in from other lower security \nfacilities as a consequence of behaviors leading to an increase is security \nclassification. \n  The mental health program at Marion consists of outpatient \nservices, including crisis intervention services and an “Intensive” Mental \nHealth Unit.  The intensive mental health unit is a 12 bed residential unit \nto house boys who have been diagnosed as severely mentally ill.  The \nintensive mental health unit at Marion is the only such residential unit \noperated by ODYS and is intended to serve all boys, regardless of actual \nsecurity classification, in need of this level of mental health care.  ODYS \noperates three “Non-intensive” Mental Health Units at other facilities for \nboys who have “a moderately severe diagnosis and whose adjustment in \nthe general population would be compromised.”  (Mental Health \nClassification Standard Operating Procedure)   \n  In addition to general housing units and the intensive mental health \nunit, Marion also contains “Critical Program Unit” housing which is \nanalogous to an adult institution maximum security segregation unit. \nMental Health Staffing \n  At the time of the August site visit, mental health staffing consisted \nof one full-time psychology supervisor, one full-time psychologist, one \nfull-time psychology assistant, one full-time clerical support person and 20 \n  55\n\nhours per week of an adult psychiatrist contractor.  Notably, there were no \npsychiatric nursing staff, no independently licensed mental health social \nworkers and no access to a child and adolescent psychiatrist (CAP).  In \naddition, I was informed that the psychology supervisor had submitted her \nresignation and would be leaving in mid-September.  ODYS Central \nOffice staff were unable to articulate an emergency/temporary coverage \nplan for the psychology supervisor vacancy.  We have since learned that a \ncontract has been entered into and that position has been filled. \n  Mental health staff assignments were aligned as follows:  \npsychology supervisor position to provide administrative function, clinical \nsupervision, crisis intervention and coverage for other psychology staff; \npsychologist assigned to cover the Critical Program Unit and all other \noutpatient care; psychology assistant recently reassigned to Intensive \nMental Health Unit full time (previously 50% outpatient and 50% mental \nhealth unit) although he hadn’t yet started assignment full time on the unit \nbecause of the need to terminate/transfer previous outpatients; 20 hours \nper week psychiatric time to cover general outpatient, Critical Program \nUnit boys on psychotropic medications and Intensive Mental Health Unit.  \nIn addition to the mental health staff, one institutional social worker was \nrecently reassigned to the Intensive Mental Health Unit full time.  (She \nhad previously provided part-time coverage there.)  Notably, this social \nworker is not Master’s prepared, independently licensed or a mental health \nsocial worker per se.  She also had not yet been on the unit full time at the \ntime of the site visit due to personal illness and participation in \ndepartmental/institutional in-service training requirements (unrelated to \nmental health training.)  \n  Marion’s psychology supervisor was not aware of any plans to \nincrease mental health staffing nor was she consulted with respect to \nstaffing needs.  Dr. Scott-Johnson from Central Office reported that an \nadditional 2.5 psychology positions, one psychiatric nurse position and 0.5 \nFTE occupational therapist had been approved and another social worker \n  56\n\nposition had been requested for Marion.  She was not able to project when \nthe approved positions would be posted or ultimately filled.   \nIntensive Mental Health Unit (IMHU) \n  As previously noted, the Intensive Mental Health Unit is a 12-bed \nmental health residential treatment unit designed to house youth diagnosed \nas severely mentally ill according to ODYS policy and operating \nprocedures.  Existing policy and procedures are not clear with respect to \nadmission criteria, continued stay criteria, discharge criteria, \nprogramming/treatment expectations on the unit and they do not provide a \nclear distinction between the Intensive and so-called “Non-intensive” \nMental Health Units.  Dr. Scott-Johnson explained that referral into either \nthe Intensive or Non-intensive mental health units is made via discussion \nbetween sending and receiving institutional psychology staff with ultimate \napproval authority for transfer into or discharge from the units being a \nfunction of Central Office.  Notably, the psychiatrist is not involved in \nadmission or discharge decision-making process.  Similarly, neither the \npsychology supervisor nor the psychology assistant on site at Marion felt \nempowered to make admission or discharge recommendations: they had \nattempted discharge recommendations in the past without success and so \nwere resigned to working with whoever was sent to them for however long \nthey were there.  The Marion mental health staff believed that at least half \nof the boys residing on the Intensive Mental Health Unit were not \nseriously mentally ill but rather displayed highly problematic behaviors as \na result of Conduct Disorder and/or antisocial tendencies.   \n  At the present time, there are no mental health programming or \nmental health related group activities on the Intensive Mental Health Unit.  \nThe sole treatment modalities are monthly psychiatric follow-up for \npsychotropic medication checks and infrequent individual sessions with \nthe psychology assistant.  These are the same interventions and \nfrequencies of interventions as received by boys on the mental health \ncaseload residing in general population and receiving so-called outpatient \n  57\n\ntreatment.  Approximately half of the boys on the Intensive Mental Health \nUnit attend classes at the high school on site for six hours daily which \nbegs the question of why they wouldn’t be more appropriately housed on \neither a Non-intensive Mental Health Unit or simply in general population \nsince they aren’t receiving anything resembling “intensive” mental health \ntreatment and are clearly functioning fairly well.  I observed the boys who \ncould not attend regular school and so were attending a shortened school \nday in a classroom on the housing unit.  They displayed clear signs of \nhighly impulsive behaviors, hyperactivity and impaired attention span \nsuggesting un-treated, under-treated or treatment-resistant Attention \nDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD.)   \nMental Health Treatment   \n  At the time of the site visit, 51 boys were prescribed psychotropic \nmedications which represents approximately 18% of the population at \nMarion.  The complete mental health caseload consists of these 51 boys \nand an additional 11 boys being seen regularly by psychology staff \n(totaling 22.5% of the population.)  By all existing prevalence studies in \njuvenile correctional populations, this is a remarkably low prevalence and \nindicates deficient screening, assessment and referral procedures and \npractices – both during the reception process (addressed in the Scioto \nsection of this report) and subsequently.   \n  Mental health treatment plans, if present, are developed \nunilaterally by psychology staff without ever actually having treatment \nteam meetings.  (There are other types of meetings at which individual \nboys mental health needs and conditions are discussed but these do not \ninclude all disciplines or the youth, and are not always documented in any \nfashion.)  Subsequently, it is not a surprise that mental health interventions \nare parallel rather than integrated and this is reflected in the \ndocumentation:  psychiatric assessments, follow-up notes and medication \ninformation are contained in the youth’s medical file while psychology \nnotes are contained in the “Psychological File.” The psychological files I \n  58\n\nreviewed contained copies of some psychiatric notes, but no record of \npsychotropic medications.  Psychological files are maintained in the \npsychology staff offices and are provided to the psychiatrist on request \nwhen she is seeing cases.  Each youth also has a social services file that \ncould contain additional mental health information.  Additionally, \npsychology notes and social service notes are in the process of being \nentered into Microsoft Access Databases.  At the present time therefore, \nthere are three paper files and two electronic files containing mental health \ninformation for each youth.  Due to the ODYS interpretation of \nconfidentiality rules and protected health information, not all disciplines \nhave access to all of these multiple files even though all may be providing \ntreatment to the youth. \n  Psychological interventions are frequently limited to crisis \ninterventions due to the paucity of staff available to provide any on-going \ntype of treatment.  There is no departmental expectation regarding the \nformat for documentation of mental health sessions.  (The psychiatrist \nuses a Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan or SOAP format routinely \nas her own personal preference.)  Similarly, there is no department-wide \ndirection or prescription for type of psychological therapeutic \ninterventions provided although Central Office has recently initiated some \npreliminary training and steps to adopt a model for providing trauma-\ninformed care throughout the department.  Presently, essentially all mental \nhealth treatment provided is via individual sessions with the psychiatrist or \na psychologist; there is no group treatment.  No psychological testing for \ndiagnostic clarification, assessment or any other use of standardized, \nobjective instruments to monitor response to treatment are conducted at \nMarion.  The rationale for this omission in a system in which psychology \nstaff are the very backbone of the mental health system was inexplicable \nby any of the on-site psychological staff.  They said they had repeatedly \nrequested psychometric tools and that their requests were repeatedly \ndenied because of the expense involved.  Central office staff \n  59\n\nacknowledged that they had not been involved in securing these types of \nmaterials for the institutions, but were “getting ready to see what everyone \nneeded.”  The Deputy Superintendent of Programs said she was not aware \nthat psychological staff needed psychological testing materials but that if \nthey put together a list of what they needed, she would purchase the \nmaterials.   \n  On a brighter note, the psychotropic medication formulary is \nunrestricted and all classes of medications are available.  The frequency of \npsychiatric follow-up is approximately monthly.  The psychiatrist does her \nown follow-up scheduling so is able to see youth more frequently as she \nbelieves necessary.  Laboratory studies and monitoring for potential \nphysical health complications from the use of psychotropic medications \nare appropriate and timely.  The psychiatrist herself generally obtains \nverbal informed consent from a parent or guardian when a child is under \nage 18.  This is documented in the medical paper file.  Informed consent \ndocuments are also mailed to parents for signature and return. \n  Surprisingly, only 2 of the 51 boys receiving psychotropic \nmedications were prescribed stimulants in spite of the high prevalence of \nADHD in this population and stimulants being treatment of choice for the \ncondition.  When queried, the psychiatrist explained that some boys had \npreviously failed trials of treatment with stimulants; and some parents \nrefused to consent to stimulants.  Subsequently, she prescribed Clonidine \nand/or atypical antipsychotic medications and/or mood stabilizing \nmedication for diagnoses of ADHD and affective disorders.  (I suspect the \nexceptionally low use of stimulants is also due in part to the fairly \nconservative prescribing practice of the adult psychiatrist herself since \ntreatment failures on previous trials was certainly not documented \nanywhere.  Other contract psychiatrists use stimulants more frequently.) \n  [On further reflection, the author of this Report wishes to make it \nclear that there is room for legitimate disagreement here as to the \nprevalence and use of medication for the ADHD population.]   \n  60\n\n  Youth in the custody of ODYS have no access to inpatient \npsychiatric care until they are 18 years old and can be hospitalized in a \nstate psychiatric hospital.  Dr. Scott-Johnson and Dr. Marrow both said \nthat they have tried to secure a contract with an inpatient psychiatric care \nprovider to no avail because all providers that have been approached have \nrefused to serve this population. \nConclusion \n  The very basics of fundamental mental health care are seriously \nlacking at both Marion and Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facilities.  \nExisting policies and procedures lack sufficient detail and clarity.  Mental \nhealth treatment is essentially limited to either crisis intervention and/or \npsychotropic medication.  This is partly based upon inadequate staffing \nlevels but also based upon a culture that appears not to recognize that they \nare missing substantial numbers of youth who need treatment.  Caseload \nprevalence data alone is indicative of deficient screening, assessment and \nreferral procedures both at the time of reception and subsequently.  \nAdditional clinicians, including independently licensed, master’s prepared \nsocial workers, psychiatric nurses and clerical staff are needed \nimmediately.   \n  Mental health treatment records are fragmented at best.  There are \nat least five files containing mental health information, three paper files \n(medical, psychological and social services) and two electronic files \n(psychological and social services).  Although this is part of a transition to \nan eventual fully electronic file, it is not acceptable at the moment because \nnot all parties providing mental health interventions are permitted access \nto all parts of the information!  The fragmented nature of the \ndocumentation is a reflection of the fragmented care provided.   \n  The psychotropic medication formulary is open and unrestricted.  \nHowever, there appears to be a profound underutilization of stimulant \nmedications for the treatment of ADHD, particularly among the males at \nMarion who were observed to be exhibiting highly problematic symptoms \n  61\n\nand behaviors of the disorder, but also among the girls.  I believe this is \npartly a cultural issue in which the use of stimulants was not supported by \nthe ODYS medical director in the past, as well as the fairly conservative \nprescribing practices of the psychiatrist, Dr. Neidermeyer, [see author’s \ncomment at p. 60, supra] in addition to the issues she raised with respect \nto lack of guardian consent in some instances.  However, I also believe \nthat the lack of access to a Child and Adolescent trained psychiatrist, \neither to provide services directly or to serve as a consultant, is a serious \nproblem for ODYS and impacts upon the ability to secure guardian \nconsent as well as a myriad of other areas, not the least of which is \nrecognition of the profound psychological and emotional developmental \ndelays experienced by these youths. \n  The two residential mental health care units I visited were little \nmore than housing units.  There was essentially no mental health program \nabove that available to any other youth in any other housing unit at either \nfacility:  some social service groups (not considered mental health), \nindividual monthly psychiatric appointments, psychotropic medications \nand occasionally, some individual psychological intervention (mainly \ncrisis intervention.)   I will not dwell on the Scioto use of “restraints upon \nrequest” again except to reiterate that this practice falls well outside the \naccepted standard of care.  Lastly, the inability to access an inpatient level \nof psychiatric care is a grave and clinically dangerous situation that should \nbe addressed immediately. \n* * * * \n [End Burns Report] \n \nWhat has been said of Scioto and Marion can be said of the other DYS facilities \nwith variations based on size and mission.  Dr. Leta Smith visited and reported on all six \nfacilities visited by the “core team” and prepared a comprehensive summary of those \nvisits. \n  62\n\nAs with Dr. Burns’ Report, Dr Smith’s excellent “Summary” should be allowed \nessentially to speak for itself.  It is presented in an edited version and represents this \nwriter’s individual findings as well. There is some overlap with areas previously covered, \nbut in my view the overlap tends to strengthen the points and does not appear to be \ninconsistent.  \n \nSummary Report Of Initial Site Visits: Leta D. Smith, Ph.D., 10/7/ \n2007 \nA.   PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE  \nIntroduction  \nOverall, the provision of mental health care and treatment \nthroughout ODYS is fundamentally deficient and structurally inadequate \nin design and function. Although reported percentages vary from facility \nto facility, the identified mental health caseload of roughly 25-35% is \nnotably low (e.g., Marion 23%; ORV ~1/3) compared with other states \nand as cited in the prevalence literature, suggestive of inadequate mental \nhealth screening, assessment, and referral processes. This is a serious \ndeficiency as it leaves unidentified youth potentially at risk of unmet and \nuntreated mental health needs, symptoms which may deteriorate or \nexacerbate, and the behavioral manifestations of their illnesses to \npotentially jeopardize their own safety and that of other youth and/or staff. \nGiven the extremely limited clinical staffing throughout the system of \nmental health care, a youth who may be quietly suffering could easily be \noverlooked and needed mental health services neglected. According to \npsychiatry at Indian River Juvenile Correctional Facility (JCF), depression \nand anxiety disorders are under-diagnosed because youth do report their \nsymptoms for fear of looking weak. Meeting with non-mental health \ncaseload youth can contribute to early detection and possibly prevention of \nmental/ emotional disturbance, crises situations, and deterioration to more \nserious conditions.   \n  63\n\nThe vast majority of youth on the mental health caseload statewide \nwere identified at Scioto Reception (see Intake below) and/or receiving \npsychiatric medication, with the remainder referred by social work or \nother staff generally for acting out or ‘weird’ behavior [Ohio River Valley \nJCF (ORV)]. For example, at Scioto, because of staffing constraints and \nother impediments to adequate treatment (discussed below), Psychology \ninfrequently meets with girls on the mental health caseload for \nindividualized non-crisis oriented treatment, and rarely meets with the \nnon-mental health caseload youth. Depression is one of the most frequent \ndiagnoses, especially for mentally health caseload females in the juvenile \njustice population, with psychotherapy as the treatment of choice, \naccording to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \nalong with careful administration and monitoring of SSRI medications if \nprescribed.  \nThe result of a lack of appropriate recognition and response to \nserious mental health disabilities can result in self-harm, harm to others, \nand/or inappropriate punishment for acting out behaviors.  \nB.   ADEQUACY OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES \nIn a most major areas of mental health governance and service \ndelivery ODYS lacks adequate policies and protocols. These policies and \nprocedures must clearly articulate expectations and consequences for non-\ncompliance. \nAside from the inadequacies in content, there does not seem to be \nthe requisite clarity and working knowledge of existing policies and \nprocedures by clinical administration or staff. There seems to be confusion \nover what are existing, newly adopted, and/ or unofficial draft policies and \nprocedures. This may, in part, be the result of recent changes, some of \nwhich were driven by our team’s findings, in administration, staff, and \npolicies, procedure and practice. Written policies and procedures need to \nmeet good practice standards, but more importantly must be explicitly \n  64\n\narticulated, internally consistent, and communicated/disseminated so that \nadministration and staff are clear about expectations.   \nPolicies and procedures are the minimal guidelines for service \ndelivery and help to define what services should be provided to which \nyouth. To illustrate this point, per SOP 403.30.02 Psychology Services, \nyouth on the mental health caseload who are identified as appropriate may \nbe (emphasis added) provided with individual treatment sessions.   \nAnother blatant example is the lack of clarity as to mission and \nofficial policies/protocols concerns definitions and operations of the \nSpecial Needs as well as Intensive and Non-intensive Mental Health \nUnits. This has resulted in grossly inadequate mental health services for \nthose youth with the most serious levels of mental health need. There \ncontinues to be an absence of mental health programming or groups; \ninadequate staffing, training, etc. The needs of youth with serious mental \nhealth disabilities are neither understood nor adequately addressed, despite \nalmost 10 years of recommendations to correct these gross inadequacies. \nThis situation continues to pose serious risks, and is a serious waste of the \nappropriated limited clinical resources.  \nDecisions to develop or define facility mental health programs \n(policies, procedures, protocols, staffing, space, etc.) must include review \nand signoff by the clinical mental health hierarchy through Central Office \nin order to promote informed decision-making and present consistent staff \nexpectations and accountability. A unit’s clinical supervisor and/or \nclinician should be an integral stakeholder in this endeavor.   \nOther Procedure:  \nConsequence Log - Of serious concern is the use of a Consequence Log at \nIndian River’s NIMHU which JCOs can use to cite certain behaviors \nwithout review of the UBIR process; however, this counts against the \nyouth. This is a “slippery slope” and needs close attention.  \n \n \n  65\n\nC. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND PEER REVIEW PROCEDURES \nQuality assurance and peer review procedures are grossly \ninsufficient. Although there are some worthy data collection efforts (e.g., \nPerformance-based Standards Project; Circleville recidivism data), as the \nmental health program and staff expectations are clarified, quality \nassurance and peer review procedures must be developed.  \nStaffing competencies, performance indicators/outcome measures \nand formal systems of care coordination (integrated treatment plans and \nmeetings, records, logs, communications) are largely undeveloped aspects \nof a quality service system.   Monitoring of staff performance is needed, \nbased on clearly specified staff expectations. \nThe Mental Health Administration has been working to establish a \nmental health database, which they feel will provide some means of \nmonitoring clinical performance (e.g., individual contacts, family contact, \netc.). Although the new database offers some information concerning the \nnature and amount of staff contact with youth, it does not rectify the \nproblems with ODYS individual treatment planning and perpetuates the \nlack of integration between the disciplines (see Adequacy of Mental \nHealth Records below). Without necessary quality improvement systems, \nthere is no adequate clarity of clinical vision or purpose, ability to monitor \nperformance, nor necessary systematic capacity to identify and improve \nproblems.  \nIn the context of a comprehensive mental health system, it is \nessential that ODYS develop competencies in specifying and assessing \nindividual improvement toward mental health goals, along with clinical \nperformance, in order to move toward individual youth and staff progress \nand positive outcomes.    \nD.      MENTAL HEALTH STAFFING  \nMental health staffing does not yet support or promote adequate \ntreatment in accordance with good practice standards of care for juvenile \njustice mental health. The lack of mental health staffing significantly \n  66\n\ncompromises the safety and well being of youth by failing to support \nopportunities for adequate assessment, treatment or follow-up mental \nhealth services, especially given the large proportion of youth with \nextensive mental health needs.    \nClinical staffing must be increased, preferably as part of a \ncoordinated plan to reduce the facility census.       \nLeadership:  \nThe absence of effective mental health leadership continues to be \nof great concern. We find a failure to adequately recognize and respond to \nthe serious and complex needs of the mentally ill youth in the ODYS \nsystem; a demonstrated lack of knowledge of pertinent issues; and little \nevidence of leadership and commitment to advocate for critical mental \nhealth system needs and required change.  \nFacility Clinical Leadership Positions:  \nFacility clinical leadership positions cannot continue to remain \nunfilled. Vacancies in some facilities in the positions of Program Deputy, \nPsychology Supervisor, and/or Social Work Supervisor create a void in \nclinical leadership, supervision, advocacy and support for the mental \nhealth program (see below).   \nPsychiatry:  \nPsychiatric services are extremely limited and for the most part, do \nnot include much more than brief medication monitoring every 30 days. \nAt ORV for example, one psychiatrist provides 2-3 hours of services per \nweek with 121 youth on psychiatric medications. With so few hours the \npsychiatrist cannot participate in team meetings including the clinical \nteam, nor meet with psychology. Extended periods of time between \nmedication reviews, along with limited opportunity for monitoring and \nfollow-up at each visit, increases the risk of untoward medical, emotional, \nand behavioral outcomes.  \n \n \n  67\n\nSocial Work:  \nSocial workers are largely case managers who provide behavioral \ngroups. In order to begin to establish mental health staffing ratios, ODYS \nmust clarify whether Social Workers as presently trained and credentialed \nshould be included as clinical staff. If social workers are to continue in \ntheir stated role as clinicians, then their credentials and job expectations \nmust be commensurate with professional standards. Under present \ncircumstances, there is a major problem including social workers who are \nnot appropriately trained and credentialed as clinical staff.  \nMost of the social workers encountered at the various facility site \nvisits hold bachelor’s level degrees if they have a license. It is important \nthat any additional mental health unit social work staff are master’s level \nlicensed social workers (MSW, LICSW, etc.) Given the Union constraints, \nand that ODYS social workers almost exclusively do case management \nand behavioral groups, ODYS might consider clinical titles other than \nsocial worker (e.g., psychologist, mental health nurse), when enhancing \ncurrent levels of clinical staffing, until and unless master’s level social \nworkers become the standard.  Perhaps the current social work title would \nmore appropriately serve as the ‘therapeutic’ Unit Manager to support \nsystem needs.  \nPsychology:  \nPsychology is greatly understaffed, resulting in a crisis- oriented \napproach, and largely precluding the ability to provide needed individual \npreventive, on-going, and follow-up treatment. Since psychiatric hours are \nfew, and many social work staff have questionable clinical credentials, this \nleaves Psychology with the responsibility for treatment, provision of \nclinical groups, as well as providing assessments, clinical input for unit \nstaff, contact with families, etc. As a result, mental health needs largely go \nuntreated and related risks increase due to the understaffing.    \n \n \n  68\n\nPsychiatric Nurse:  \nAside from Scioto, I am not aware of other mental health nurses in \nthe system.  A Psychiatric nurse is an important interface in conveying \nclinical information to and from the psychiatrist, monitoring side effects, \nand behavioral and emotional adjustment, and providing individual and \ngroup medication education.   \nAs proposed at Marion, for example, a minimum of 0.5 FTE \nPsychiatric Nurse could provide support for the Intensive Mental Health \nUnit and also serve an additional .25 for the general population and .25 for \nthe CPI/ disciplinary unit.  \nOccupational Therapist (OT) and Recreational Therapist (RT) Services:  \nOT and RT provide valuable support for mental health populations, \nespecially those on units with more intensive mental health needs because \nthey can provide fine and gross motor activities as well as tasks which \nfocus attention and have a high probability of success for individuals \nsuffering from serious mental illness. These activities promote self-esteem \nand self-confidence for mentally ill youth who are frequently unable to \nparticipate in the more challenging schedule of general population. As part \nof an individual treatment plan, these activities also help youth divert \nexcess physical energies into positive/ constructive activities, rather than \nnegative emotional disturbance and/or behavioral acting out.   \nClerical support:  \nMost facilities do not have clerical support that is essential to \ntimely clinical communication, documentation, record-keeping, and \nmonitoring. Without clerical support, clinical information frequently \ncannot be processed and shared with Team members as needed to provide \nappropriate program placement decisions and treatment response. \nMoreover, valuable clinical time necessary for provision of assessment \nand other mental health services for youth is otherwise ‘wasted’ on \nclerical tasks, unnecessarily increasing the risk of harm due to unmet \nclinical concerns.  (This is not unlike the dentist situation where dentists \n  69\n\ndo “prep” and other work typically done by unavailable dental \nassistants/hygienists.) \nSTAFFING RATIOS19  \nAs previously stated, in order to begin to determine clinical staff-\nto-youth ratios, the qualifications of social worker must first be clarified. \nFacility size, physical plant, and level of care as part of a defined \ncontinuum of mental health services are all relevant to these decisions. \nAdequate case finding is necessary to determine the extent of mental \nhealth need throughout ODYS in order to plan for and define a system of \ncare. Notwithstanding these issues, it is clear that clinical staffing is \ninadequate.  \nOnce the extent of mental health need is assessed, it is likely that \nODYS will find that most youth have mental health needs that can be \nserved in the general population given adequate resources and program \nsupport for the provision of clinic services. Adequate mental health \nclinical staffing is necessary in general facility populations where the \nmajority of the youth with mental health needs reside. They require: \nongoing monitoring, brief intervention, and/or continuing mental health \nservices. This model also contributes to prevention by early identification \nand intervention before mental health deterioration and decompensation.  \nFor the purpose of this draft, clinicians are defined as \npsychologists, licensed master’s level social workers, and psychiatric \nnurses. \nGENERAL POPULATION CLINICAL STAFFING \nAlthough there are no formally accepted national standards for \nclinical staffing ratios for the juvenile justice setting of which we are \naware, staffing ratios will be offered here as general guidelines and a basis \nfor settlement talks based on the professional experience and expertise of \nthe team. Generally accepted clinical staffing for children and youth is \n                                                 \n19 The staffing ratios provided in this and the following sections are offered in the context of litigation \nleading, hopefully, to a settlement.  They should be viewed as springboards to discussion and not fixed \nratios to be “defended” by the Team. \n  70\n\ndouble that of adults. Given the particularly serious, complex, and deep-\nrooted mental health issues evidenced in the female juvenile justice \npopulation, even richer ratios are justified. The literature demonstrates that \nthe mental health needs for females are far more complex and extensive \nthan their male counterparts, whose needs are also significant.  \nStaffing ratios should meet the need to provide an individualized \ntreatment plan and needs for each youth, with prescribed interventions \ntoward specified goals and youth outcomes and group sessions to address \npervasive youth clinical needs (e.g., co-occurring substance abuse and \nmental health diagnoses). Overall facility population clinical caseloads are \nproposed at a ratio of 1 clinician to approximately 15 identified mentally \nill girls (i.e., 1:15). This level of staffing would allow youth individual \ntherapy up to twice a week, and still provide the opportunity to attend to \nthe other clinical functions (e.g., suicide watch, discharge planning, etc), \nas well as time consuming ancillary functions.  Clinical staffing levels for \nmales in general population might be considered at 1 clinician to 20 (i.e., \n1:20).  \nAdequate psychiatric resources are also necessary to provide \nmedication monitoring and adjustment as dictated by ODYS policy and \ngood practice, along with other traditional psychiatric services. \nRecognizing that Child and Adolescent psychiatrists are a scarce national \nresource and traditionally few and far between in juvenile justice settings, \nevery effort should be made to attract and cultivate partnerships (e.g., \nthrough Child Psychiatry and Forensic fellowship programs) with \nindividuals who have training and expertise in child and adolescent \npsychiatry. Dr. Burns, of course, echoes this call. \nPsychiatric support is proposed at 1:60-80.  \n(INTENSIVE) MENTAL HEALTH UNIT STAFFING  \nThe Mental Health Units must provide a level of staffing to ensure \na safe and therapeutic environment.  Clinical staffing patterns for each \nIMHU include a minimum of two (2) and preferably three (3) full time \n  71\n\nequivalent (FTE) mental health clinicians and a Treatment Team Leader. \nThe goal is to establish a multi-disciplinary treatment team, with a \nTreatment Team Leader and the remaining FTE’s selected from the titles \nof Psychologist, Licensed Master’s level Social Worker and Psychiatric \nNurse.  A minimum of 0.2 FTE (preferably 0.5 FTE) Psychiatrist is \nnecessary for the IMHU (plus an additional minimum of 0.3 FTE, \npreferably 0.5 FTE Psychiatrist for identified mentally ill youth in the \nfacility general population.  \nNON-INTENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT STAFFING  \nIn order to determine appropriate levels of staffing and number of \nnon-intensive mental health units needed, programs must be defined as \ncomponents of a continuum of mental health care.20 Other relevant factors \nare discussed at the beginning of this section.  If ODYS determines that a \nnumber of NIMHUs are necessary then perhaps additional classification \nconsiderations (e.g. age) could be added.  Depending on program \ndefinition (see Section K), the population for a step-down or intermediate \ncare program should not exceed 20 and should be staffed similarly to the \nIMHU given that the number of beds would be nearly double. If located \nproximate to the NIMHU, the Treatment Team Leader as well as the \nspecialized support staff (e.g., OT, RT) could be shared. Additional \npsychiatric services (~ 0.2 FTE) would be necessary.  \nE.       SUFFICIENCY OF ANCILLARY STAFF \nWithout a safe environment, effective treatment, programming, \nand/or learning cannot take place. Treatment and security go hand in hand, \neach required for the effectiveness of the other. All personnel must operate \nwith the expectation and understanding that they are, in effect, part of a \nTreatment Team, in which they function to support the treatment/ \nrehabilitative goals.   \n                                                 \n20 The term “Intermediate Care Units” as preferable to Non-Intensive Mental Health Units. Non-Intensive \nis inaccurate since seriously ill youth could be on this unit, requiring more enhanced care than available in \nthe general population. \n  72\n\nCurrently JCOs function almost exclusively as custodial staff. The \naddition of mid-level managers (i.e., Unit Managers) has provided some \nameliorating this security predilection; however, administration must \nsupport the UM’s important functions by minimizing their needs to be \npulled from their units for a variety of purposes.  \nJuvenile Correctional Officers (JCOs) ultimately should be \nintegrated into the treatment team. Behavioral issues should be addressed \nby JCOs within the structure of an effective behavioral management \nsystem, with an individual plan as indicated. The Ohio JCO job \ndescription, now ignored, specifically includes implementing treatment \nservices for mental health, sex offender, and chemical dependency \nprograms.  \nF. TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND DISCIPLINE OF CLINICIANS \nSUPERVISION \nFilling all Program Deputy and Psychology positions is essential in \norder for there to be appropriate facility clinical leadership presence, \nclinical support and supervision. A number of these positions have been \nvacant which drains scarce clinical resources to cover supervisory \nfunctions and more importantly further dis-empowers the clinical \nprogram, particularly when combined with an absence of mental health \nleadership and supervision in Central Office (e.g., Circleville CJF)  \nTRAINING \nMental health in-service for clinicians as well as for all levels of \nstaff is inadequate, thereby compromising their ability to respond as \neffectively to the serious mental health needs that the ODYS population \npresent.  \nIn-service opportunities must provide consistent messages, tied to \nclear expectations, including but not limited to newly articulated policies \nand protocols. For training to be effective, credible, and productive, it \nmust be clearly coordinated, planned, and delivered. \n  73\n\nClinical staff need system-wide consistent clinical enhancement \ntraining (e.g., DBT, treatment planning, etc.). Currently clinical staff are \nable to pursue additional clinical training of their own initiative and \nchoosing, and to then be reimbursed by ODYS. While this opportunity can \nprovide a positive supplement, the mental health administration must \ndevelop its own core clinical curriculum in order for all clinical staff to \nhave requisite training and skills that are expected and supported by the \nagency.  \nG.       ADEQUACY OF MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS \nStaff need to develop specific individual treatment plans and goals, \nand assess progress toward these goals. Plans need to include interventions \nthat are strength-based, work toward specific individualized goals, and \ninclude families whenever possible in treatment planning and delivery. \nCurrent ODYS treatment planning is generally inadequate. Progress notes \nare not in standardized (SOAP) format. Without an integrated treatment \nplan, a coordinated and purposeful treatment response does not exist. The \nseparate systems of clinical record-keeping are an obstacle to integrated \nand effective planning and treatment. In general administration and staff \ndo not seem to be clear on what a treatment plan is and particularly a \ncoordinated treatment plan.   \nThere is no single unified mental health clinical treatment plan \nwhere the youth participates in setting goals with steps to get there, and \nwhere progress is measured and documented. There needs to be one team \nthat sets a normative culture and speaks a common language that \naddresses the treatment of all aspects of the youth’s behavioral and \nemotional health and well-being. There needs to be a ‘holistic’ approach, \nso that there are consistent goals for the individual youth and so that staff \nof the various disciplines function as a team and provide informed and \nconsistent direction and support for successful youth treatment outcomes. \nTreatment and security are being compromised by the current \ninadequacies.    \n  74\n\nAlso noted consistently in all reports since 2004, ODYS has not \nestablished an integrated clinical hierarchy, treatment plan, or \ndocumentation system. Psychology is not a component of a \nmultidisciplinary treatment team in the commonly accepted sense. The \nrecord keeping is a nightmare, even with the new database. It is not in a \nstandard medical record format.  There are at least four separate records \n[i.e., psychology, social work (Unified Case Record/general file), school, \nand medical record]. There is no single mental health clinical treatment \nplan. There is a psychological file and a psychology database, not a mental \nhealth file. The Special Management Plan is not part of the database. The \nClinical Team Meeting notes are not kept in the file. It is extremely \ndifficult to find necessary clinical information with the beginning of a \ndatabase and paper files in multiple locations. The paper files are not \nordered consistently, and the records could benefit from tabs.  The \nCircleville clinical program is further limited by the absence of a \ncentralized file system, and psychology’s inability to access each other’s \nfiles without a cumbersome time-consuming process. This fragmented \nmeans of documentation and communication impedes integrated treatment \nplanning and necessary sharing of information for continuity of care. \nThere are a number of meetings where youth on the mental health \ncaseload are discussed, but they are neither consistently held nor \ndocumented throughout the facilities. Psychiatry Team Meetings are \nintended to include psychiatry and psychology; Clinical Team Meetings to \ninclude psychology, social work and unit manager; and Interdisciplinary \nTeam (IDT) meeting which is scheduled once per week and includes \nsocial work, psychology, UM, JCO, with until recently, the occasionally \nparticipating education, recreation, and/or health personnel. The IDT \nseems to be the best documented meeting; however, suffers from lack of \npsychiatric participation, limited opportunity/ time to discuss each youth, \nwhat staff expressed as a major focus on behavioral/ custodial concerns, \nand limited capacity for psychology’s direct  participation given multiple \n  75\n\nsimultaneous meetings and one/few psychology staff. This limits \nintegrated treatment planning with the risks and liabilities of failing to \ncommunicate and address treatment needs.  \nEffective treatment of youth does not and cannot occur until there \nis integrated treatment planning, communication and documentation.     \nH.   CRISIS MANAGEMENT AND SUICIDE WATCH POLICIES \nAND PROCEDURES  \nAs discussed in the 2004 report regarding Scioto, youth were using \nthe threat of suicide as a means of gaining attention or the opportunity to \nspeak with psychologists.  The relatively few psychologists spent most of \ntheir time responding to crises. Obviously suicide threats and the need to \nperform risk assessments further limits psychology time and ability to \nprovide other treatment aside from crisis intervention, and reinforces such \nattention-seeking behavior.  \nWhile it can be difficult in many cases immediately to distinguish \ndefinitively between a suicide gesture and attempt, youth remain on \nsuicide watch for questionably long periods of time, at Scioto, up to 30 \ndays or more. Extended suicide watch beyond several days is rarely, if \never, clinically warranted.  Extended use of watch is generally indicative \nof the need for youth to be receiving 1) more adequate assessment, 2) \ntherapy and/or 3) hospital level care.   \nThere are youth who seek suicide status as a means of gaining \nsafety from perceived or actual threats in population. Clinicians at ORV \n(Psychologists and Social Workers) note the increase in manipulated use \nof suicide watch to escape potentially threatening situations during the \npast seven to eight months. The number of suicide watch and behavior \nstatus also hit an all time high over the first seven months of 2007 \nincreasing from 11 to 29 on suicide watch, 4 to 6 on observations, and 11 \nto 27 on behavior status.  \nPsychology indicates that they have seen a dramatic increase in \nyouth who report being scared of peer violence, who are not on the mental \n  76\n\nhealth caseload, but who are manipulating suicide watch, once again, in \npursuit of a safe haven. Now precautionary status is not just for the \npsychiatrically vulnerable but is a result of a highly stressful environment \nfor youth, and certainly for staff as well.  \nCRISIS MANAGEMENT  \nSafety Plan – According to the revised 2006 SOP concerning \nYouth Disciplinary Procedures, a Safety Plan is a special management \nplan written to specifically manage assaultive and/ or threatening \nbehavior(s).  \nSpecial Management Plan (SMP) is a procedure designed to \ndecrease severe and/or chronic problem youth behavior(s). \nThe 2002 Special Management Plans Standard Operating \nProcedures (SOP) 305.01.01 requires that SMPs are to be signed ‘by the \nPsychology Supervisor (at institutions where there is one), Deputy \nSuperintendent of Programs and Superintendent or designee.’ If an SMP is \ndeveloped for a youth on the mental health caseload or being followed by \npsychology, the plan must be signed by a psychologist. SMPs requiring \nthe use of seclusion…will be reviewed on at least a weekly basis. As the \nPsychology Supervisor position was vacant at Scioto, for example, non-\nclinical staff provided signoff. \nMohican and Indian River JCF were more effective in having \npsychology sign-off on an SMP for a youth on the mental health caseload \nor followed by Psychology. Both the Psychologist and the facility \nProgram Deputy Mohican agreed that the Psychologist can refuse to sign a \nyouth’s SMP and this will be supported by the Program Deputy. In \ndiscussions with these staff, they recalled specific cases.  \nThe Psychologist notes that the goal is to keep youth out of \nseclusion and the SMPs are intended to help youth learn how to do so. The \nPsychologist and Social Work Supervisor are first to review the plans at \nIndian River and this way can reject them if they are clinically unsound. \n  77\n\nHowever, even with their good intentions, with all the youth on their \ncaseloads, and so many SMPs, some plans may ‘fall between the cracks.”   \nAs discussed further below in Section M., these plans for the most \npart are not individualized, strength-based, tied to treatment goals, nor \nproviding adequate incentives. Plans routinely include what we believe is \nconstitutionally excessive use of seclusion and frequently do not involve \nclinical signoff in non-mental health units.  \nI.   USE OF MECHANICAL RESTRAINTS ON MENTALLY ILL \nWARDS \nThe Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Mechanical \nRestraints 301.05.02 requires that ‘Mental Health staff shall conduct an \ninitial assessment of the youth upon notification of mental health or \npsychiatric concerns or when youth are restrained beyond 4 hours. JCOs \nmust report any health or mental health concerns immediately to nursing \nstaff and/or mental health staff and the Unit Administrator/Operations \nManager.  \nIn the event that restraints may be necessary to prevent self-injury, \na more restrictive separate SOP 301.05.04, Mechanical Restraints Used for \nPsychiatric Purposes applies. Both of SOPs are relatively new and issued \nin 2006. The SOP for psychiatric purposes to prevent self-harm requires \nthat mechanical restraints ‘shall only be applied with the approval of the \nSuperintendent and institutional Psychologist, Psychiatrist or Physician.’ \nThe use of mechanical restraints for these purposes is fairly well defined \nto include procedural requirements for a suicide risk assessment, less \nrestrictive interventions (but other forms of restraint nonetheless), along \nwith a plan which limits their use to an hour, with constant visual \nmonitoring including interaction, etc. JCOs who monitor the youth are \nrequired to report any health or mental health concerns immediately to \nnursing, and/or mental health staff and the Unit Administrator/ Operations \nManager.   \n  78\n\nJ.   ADEQUACY OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES/ \nPHYSICAL PLANT  \nMENTAL HEALTH UNITS \nThe Circleville NIMHU is the only ODYS mental health unit with \ntwo tiers, having 12 rooms upstairs, and 12 down. The tiers are open, and \nalso have vertical rail bars. Youth who are doing best have beds upstairs. \nThis physical plant design poses an unacceptably high suicide risk, \nespecially for youth with more serious mental health disabilities who are \nalready at higher risk of self harm and suicide as evidenced by their \nplacement and retention on the NIMHU. The physical plant is ripe for \ndiving into the floor below, surely resulting in serious injury and/or death, \nand/or hanging from the rungs on the rails, which provide no meaningful \nprotection from jumping, diving, or hanging.  There are relatively easy \nphysical changes that should be made as suicide prevention measures.21\nRUBBER ROOMS \nThe condition of the two rubber rooms at Indian River is \ndisgraceful, and again seriously limits the ability to provide necessary \nprotection for youth who require this room to prevent self-harm as a result \nof their mental illness. The rubber rooms actually are not seclusion rooms \nbut safety rooms.   \nOther youth outside the NIMHU are brought onto the NIMHU, \nmostly at night, when they cannot be managed elsewhere in the facility for \ntheir behaviors. For these facility youth, Psychology does not decide on \nentry and release from these rubber rooms. According to staff and youth \nreports, these youth disrupt the Unit with their loud noise, preventing them \nfrom sleeping, and intensifying their emotional distress.  \nNon-NIMHU youth have trashed the rubber rooms. There is \ngraffiti carved into the walls, floors, and ceiling, including with pen. One \nrubber room has at least a 10-inch circle where the rubber is ripped out of \n                                                 \n21 For example, encase the railings so there are no spaces and no ability to leap over the second floor railing \nand remove/repair loose and broken floor tiles, which can pose a potential risk for being used for cutting \nself or used as a weapon. \n  79\n\nthe door, exposing wood and leaving the loose door rubber exposed, \nposing hazards for health and safety by ingestion and head banging.  The \nsecond Indian River rubber room is also covered in graffiti and ripped up \nby youth in cuffs severely misbehaving from the E Unit. The damage to \nthe door of the second rubber room is even greater than the first. Neither \nof these rooms may now be used for mental health purposes as intended. \nOne youth on the NIMHU caseload routinely bangs his head on the wall, \nbut the rubber rooms cannot be used to protect him. \nNo youth from outside the NIMHU should be brought onto the \nUnit. While there is a need for certainly of protective, simple room \nhousing there must be a more appropriate place designed to house victim-\nprone and victims of violence.  \nThe rubber room at Marion Intensive Mental Health Unit also \ncontinues to be unavailable because a youth bit a hole in the wall. That \nroom is unavailable for use by the youth who have ‘intensive’ mental \nhealth needs and are at the highest risk of harming themselves or others.   \nThe very term “rubber room,” with its disgraceful, mental hospital \nimplications, and then the room itself and questionable usage calls for an \nurgent change in policy and procedure for youth who require brief periods \nof time in a safe place to sleep. \n SUICIDE WATCH ROOMS \nAt ORV (McGuffey), what distinguishes Suicide Watch rooms \nfrom other unit cells is that there are no shelves and that they have two as \nopposed to one window for observation. The metal beds provide \nunacceptably high risk factors for suicide and/ or harm to self or others. \nAlthough Intake is not in a mental health unit, youth at intake are \namong those at highest risk of suicide. The wet room at Indian River’s \nIntake Unit is also used for suicide watch. Everything is in view except the \nshower, which has handicap bars and can be observed only through a \nsmall window slot in the outer hallway. This is a high risk area. [Another \n  80\n\nmajor risk in using this room for suicide watch is the metal bed with legs, \nwhich should be replaced with a safety bed.]  \nLACK OF DEDICATED CLINICAL SPACE \nThe impact of the systemic lack of dedicated physical space for \nclinical services is most blatantly exemplified at Indian River. In order to \nprovide necessary access to Psychiatric treatment, Psychiatry needs a \ndedicated clinically appropriate space to meet with youth on their \ncaseload. The time psychiatrists and social workers spend looking for a \nclinically appropriate space, locating and transporting youth, and finding \nancillary clinical information obviously diminishes the limited psychiatric \ntime available for providing necessary and timely treatment and \nmonitoring of youth.  \nMental health care, at all facilities, requires a dedicated clinically \nappropriate space, assigned JCO transport of youth to and from their \nappointments, and necessary integration (including space proximate to \nclinical staff) between the disciplines for sharing of critical clinical \ninformation. All of these improvements would enhance fiscal efficiency \nand professional time needed for provision of treatment.  \nMENTAL HEALTH UNIT FURNISHINGS  \nBeds \nThere are five of double bunk beds on the NIMHU at ORV. \nAlthough they are kept vacant, bunk beds provide an opportunity for youth \nto dive into the floor from the top bunk. The upper bed, even if \nunoccupied provides an unacceptable suicide risk for this population. They \nalso provide the capacity for double-bunking which contributes to the \nlevel of aggression where they exist. Clinical staff on the NIMHU noted \nthat some of the emotional and behavioral improvement of youth on their \nunit can be attributed simply to the single bunking.  \nSafety furniture \nSafety furniture is a commonly accepted standard for mental health \npopulations. Metal bunk beds are unacceptable on a mental health unit \n  81\n\n(e.g., Circleville NIMHU) as they pose safety risks for their potential for \naffixing a ligature and their sharp edges.  Units should also have sand \nchairs or some form of heavier chairs (such as Moduform) rather than the \nstandard lighter chairs (e.g., Circleville NIMHU) so they cannot be \nthrown.  \nNIMHU Ceiling Grate \nThe Circleville bathroom ceiling has open grates which can \nprovide unnecessary suicide risk as a ligature can be suspended or affixed \nto the grates.     \nDoor Stop, Door Handles, Sink Fixtures \nEven the rather simply remedied physical plant recommendations \nfrom the Team’s first site were not addressed at the update visit to the \nMarion Intensive Mental Health Unit. The door stop behind the \nconference room door was not removed as recommended, presenting a \ncontinuing suicide risk for a population with intensive mental health \ndisabilities.  \nThe other recommended repairs also remained unaddressed. This \nincludes the door handles and sinks that need to be replaced with more \nsuitable fixtures for this population.  The door handles pose suicide risks \nand do not meet the commonly accepted standard for this population. The \nsink fixtures are easily disassembled and can be used as devices to cut self \nor others. The IMHU has already experienced this problem a number of \ntimes but rather than replace the sinks has continued to simply repair the \nsame sink fixtures.  \n[Information received after these issues were raised strongly \nsuggest that ODYS is being responsive to the physical plant problems \nidentified at Marion.] \nLack of Adequate Cameras  \nThroughout the system greater video camera coverage is needed. \nStaff and youth claim peer and staff abuse in areas where there is \ninadequate camera coverage (e.g., ORV sallyports). Indian River NIMHU \n  82\n\nis developing a comfort room that is being planned near the end of a \nlengthy hallway of cells. Cameras should be installed to enhance \nnecessary monitoring and to avoid the risks of self-harm and other \npotential abuse in the use of this fairly isolated room. Additionally, there \nneeds to be a clearly articulated program with policies and procedures for \nutilizing the comfort room.  \nK.    ADEQUACY OF MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS \n(INCLUDING NUMBER OF PROGRAMMING BEDS)  \nPSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT CAPACITY \nA capacity for psychiatric inpatient hospitalization is a critical \ncomponent of a mental health continuum of care that currently is lacking \nin ODYS. A mental health unit does not and cannot provide hospital level \ncare. It is totally unacceptable, legally and as a matter of policy, that there \nis no identifiable means to access psychiatric inpatient care for youth \nunder age 18.  \nOTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM COMPONENTS   \nThis section will more specifically discuss the lack of an ODYS \ncontinuum of mental health care. Access to and the extent to which \nprogram beds need to be developed has been discussed. The adequacy of \nprogram beds is a moot point when the units have no clear purpose or \ndefinition. There are no formal admission, retention and/or discharge \ncriteria or policies and procedures for these program components/ units.  \nThe mental health programming on the mental health units is \nlargely indistinguishable from that on the other units. The unit staff have \nlittle-to-no additional mental health training, and additional treatment \nprotocols have not been clearly defined.  As has been noted, an integrated \ntreatment team needs to be developed, with the JCOs included as integral \nmembers of the team in order to provide a coordinated and consistent \ntreatment response.   \n[End Smith Report] \n \n  83\n\nCertainly, any reader who has come this far will conclude that there simply is no \nmental health program worthy of the name now functioning within ODYS.  There are \ncertainly a series of ad hoc arrangements for care; there certainly are some dedicated \nproviders of care who struggle daily to help, but minimal constitutional obligations are \nnot being met and, sadly, this was the theme of the November 2004 Report. \nWe constantly hear a series of “we can’t,” “we tried,” “we didn’t know,” and \n“we’ll do better.”  This reminds me of a term I heard used by Federal District Court \nJudge Thelton Henderson in describing the dysfunctional California Department of \nCorrections as staffed by persons with “trained incapacity.” \nAt this point, however, an absence of funds or the difficulty of recruitment may \nserve as explanations but not as valid excuses for not having an acceptable mental health \nprogram. \nThe remainder of Dr. Smith’s full Report discusses continuum of care issues in \nthe form of units designed for intensive care and intermediate care and the need for \nprograms and services in the various restricted housing units.  Those areas of discussion \nand her concluding sections may be consulted but are not offered as findings by this \nwriter. \nIt is of the highest priority that ODYS cease and desist from the extended terms of \nde facto punitive isolation practices while adopting measures to assure the safety of youth \nand staff.  This will require staff enrichment, design modifications, new policy  & \nprocedures, and close oversight.  Beyond this troublesome area, DYS officials should \navoid the ad hoc responses to mental health care crisis — crisis that emerged because \nthey were observed, not sudden events — and develop, staff, and implement an overall, \ncomprehensive plan for a continuum of care. \n  84\n\nADDENDUM 22\nSection IV, Mental Health Care \n \n \nInitiatives in place to address Treatment: \n \n \nNATIONAL GRANT FOR MENTAL HEALTH \n•  Ohio has been selected as one of four states to participate in the MacArthur \nFoundation Models for Change Mental Health / Juvenile Justice Action Network \nGrant.  This initiative focues on system reform in mental health and substance \nabuse services for youth involved in the juvenile justice system, including DYS.  \nIt will assist Ohio’s juvenile justice system in developing and implementing \nimproved policies and practices based on the best available research and \ntechniques for mental health and substance abuse services. \n \nTRAUMA INFORMED CARE \n•  Because of the amount of trauma that ODYS youth have experienced, ODYS is \nworking to equip staff with more effective ways of working with a highly \ntraumatized population.  There is a Childhood Trauma Task group assembled to \ndevelop staff training on the prevalence and impact of trauma and provide \nstrategies for assisting these youth to cope and point out how “traditional” \ncorrectional practices have the potential to be re-traumatizing. \n  \n•  Training on Trauma Informed Care has begun and ODYS senior staff, psychology \nstaff, social work supervisors and mental health unit staff will be included in the \ntraining as well as unit staff.  As of December 2007, Dr. Marrow has trained well \nover 100 staff assigned to mental health units using the 6-hour trauma informed \ncare curriculum.   \n \n•  Trauma related programming has begun for the female population utilizing \nnationally recognized clinician Stephanie Covington’s work, with additional \nprogramming being developed for the females and males to assist them in \nmanaging their own trauma. \n \n•  ODYS, in collaboration with the Ohio Department of Mental Health, is funding \nthe implementation of the curriculum Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide to \nEducation and Treatment (TARGET) through a contract with Advanced Trauma \nSolutions.  The curriculum was selected by the Trauma Steering Committee and is \na promising practice developed by nationally known expert, Dr. Julian Ford. \nIntensive training for mental health units began in September 2007 and will \ncontinue in January 2008.   \n                                                 \n22 Submitted by ODYS to Fred Cohen on December 21, 2007.  Fred Cohen excised some of this submission \nand slightly edited other parts. \n  85\n\nMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES \n•  Capital funds in the amunt of $2.85 million were secured for the FY07-08 biennium with \nthe anticipation of building or restructuring the mental health units.   \n \n•  The programming, environment, and staffing are being modified on the male and female \nmental health units.  The new curriculum addresses the specific mental health needs of \nthe population by focusing on stabilization, emotion regulation and the development of \ncoping skills. This program integrates different phases with a richly staffed unit, sensory \nprograms and therapeutic atmosphere.  The last phase will focus on preparing the youth  \nto return to a lower level of care or for release.   \n \n•  ODYS is working with A.R. Phoenix Resources Inc., Dr. Alton to select a group \nof flexible curriculum to use with our youth in order to better meet their \nindividual needs.  The curriculum will be administered on a dosage basis which \nmeans that we can create program tracks that would benefit youth of all risk \nlevels, lengths of stay and need.  We anticipate training on the new curriculum to \nbegin in 2008. \n \n•  An intensive adolescent recovery substance abuse program has begun for female \nyouth at Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility. \n \n•  In 2005 the OSU contract for psychiatry was expanded to include all of ODYS’ \ncentral Ohio facilities. \n \n•  Contract negotiations with OSU to formalize the process for inpatient psychiatric \nservices has led to a contract, which is anticipated to go into effect January 15, \n2008.  Our team did not review this contract. \n \n•  A psychology position has been added to Scioto, specifically to assist with the \nmental health unit. \n \n•  All psychology assistants are masters trained clinicians. \n \n \nPOLICIES AND PROCEDURE \n•  Beginning in October 2005, following extensive discussion with the union, \nrequirements for clinical positions have been enhanced.  Since 2005, the number \nof licensed social workers has nearly doubled from 26 to 50. \n \n•  Policy has been developed to address restraint use on the mentally ill population \nand staff are now being trained on restraint techniques from the National \nTechnical Assistant Center (NTAC).  All training officers have been trained on \nthe new techniques by a nurse administrator. \n \n•  A mental health database is being created to monitor and share information. \n \n  86\n\n \nAESTHETICS IN THE UNITS \n•  Comfort rooms are being designed for use by youth on mental health units.  These \nrooms, or designated areas, will provide some degree of privacy and quiet where \nyouth can explore the use of many sensory items to assist them in managing stress \nand developing coping strategies.  The rooms are to be painted in serene tones and \nstocked with items that engage the senses such as video rockers, weighted \nblankets, stress balls, bean bags, and music which can be used by the youth while \nin the room. \n \n•  General population units are also to be changed and to become less punitive and \nmore normalized by including couches, rugs, richer colors and plant life. \n \n•  Approximately 150 leisure reading books (i.e. Harry Potter and Chicken Soup for \nKids) are now available in nearly every housing unit in each DYS institution. \n \n \nEFFORTS IN RECRUITMENT \n•  Given the difficulty of all state agencies to recruit psychologist and even greater \ndifficulty in finding adolescent and child trained psychologists ODYS is \nenhancing its effort in the hiring and recruitment of mental health professionals to \ninclude the following: \n \no  ODYS participated in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Services Task \nforce to review and determine creative ways of dealing with the issue of a \nsignificant deficit locally and nationally of child and adolescent \npsychiatrists \no  Partnered with the Ohio Psychological Association to assist in recruiting \npsychologists  \no  Expansion of the psychiatry contract for OSU. \no  Development and continuation of a social work internship program with \nThe Ohio State University School of Social Work \no  Development of an Internship/Postdoctoral program with Marshall \nUniversity at ORVJCF \no  Another postdoctoral program is planned with Wright State University \nSchool of Professional Psychology for the Central Ohio Facilities \no  A new bureau chief with background in residential mental health was \nhired in December 2007. \no  A psychiatrist has been identified for ORVJCF and will begin providing \n20 to 40 hours per week in January 2008 \no  ODYS has created one SW 3 position for each IMHU that requires a \nmaster’s level social worker with a license (LISW) or Professional \nClinical Counselor (PCC) \n \n \n  87\n\nV.  PROGRAMMING FOR JUVENILE SEX OFFENDERS \n \nThe vast majority of juvenile sex offenders (97%) that are processed through \nreception at Scioto have been adjudicated on a sexual offense.  These youth represent \nabout one-fifth (21%) of all the youth in the custody of DYS. \nAt the time of expert Dr. Robert Prentky’s visits to Ohio (Sept. 21, 22, and 23) \nthat amounted to some 384 youth designated as sex offenders in the system with 139 of \nthem assigned as “High Needs,” 70 as “Moderate Needs,” and 30 as “Low Needs.”  Of \nthe total of 384 juveniles designated as sex offenders, there were 145 youth still in the \ncustody of DYS but not in any sex offender programming. \nOf the 239 remaining in sex offender programming, 58% were classified as High \nNeeds.  Although bed space is a placement issue, staff asserted that bed availability is not \nan issue with respect to need classification.  Assessment staff stated to Dr. Prentky, “We \ndon’t even know what beds are available.  We see the worst of the worst, so the fact that \n60% are High Needs is no surprise.” \nBefore proceeding to an account of the expert review on our behalf by Dr. \nPrentky, a few cautionary words by this writer are in order.  First, and perhaps foremost, \nthe terms “sex offender,” “sexual psychopath,” “sexual predator, “ and “sexually \ndangerous” are not clinically valid terms.23  This means, in part, that there is no \nconstitutional right to treatment based on the disease model that underpins the Eighth \nAmendment’s or Fourteenth Amendment’s right to treatment. \nThe normative terms listed above do not tell us anything about treatment needs, \nthey do not allow us to distinguish offenders based on the nature of the offense, and they \nsay virtually nothing about risk.  The unitary terms such as sex offender or sex \npsychopath tells us much more about the purveyor than the offender.  Their use reflects a \nnormative stance that juveniles (and adults) who engage in criminally forbidden, sexually \nrelated conduct should be singled out for special attention, perhaps for special \nprogramming, and for post-adjudication or post-conviction registration that may last a \nlifetime. \n                                                 \n23 See Fred Cohen, Right to Treatment in the Sex Offender: Corrections, Treatment, and Legal Practice 24-\n1, 24-3 (Barbara K. Schwartz & Henry R. Cellini, ed’s., 1995)(Hereafter, Cohen, “Treatment.”) \n  88\n\nA moral judgment about the nature of an offense or the offender is distinct from a \nreasonable basis for treatment and a reasoned fear of recidivism.  Franklin E. Zimring in \nAn American Travesty: Legal Responses to Adolescent Sexual Offending 67 (2004) \nwrites: \nThe 15000 children and adolescents under eighteen years of age arrested \nfor sex crimes each year are a heterogeneous group in terms of their \noffense severity, their risk of future sexual misconduct, and their degree of \npsychological pathology.  The great majority of youthful sex offenders are \nunlikely to re-offend, and are not suffering from extensive clinical \ndisabilities.  But the few thousand juveniles who are arrested, in contrast \nto the millions who commit sex crimes, are often involved in behavior that \nharms people, usually children and adolescents.  The palpable harm \ncaused by many juvenile sex offenders requires an official response.  The \nlow risk of future sexual misconduct and the low likelihood of serious \nsexual pathology argue against life-altering interventions and permanent \nclassification in stigmatic categories as routine responses to adolescent \nsexual misconduct. \nThe legal issue within this litigation is not a demand for treatment based on sex \noffender designation.  Ohio law and policy, offering mandated treatment or programming \nis well within the boundaries of legal acceptability but is at the perimeter — and beyond \n— on the effective use of treatment resources. \nWe may presume that some juvenile sex offenders have a legitimate, diagnosable \nmental illness — Professor Zimring estimates that fewer than 10% of U.S. juveniles \narrested show any sign of paraphilia24 — and that group, of course, should be treated. \nUsing Professor Zimring’s estimate, for Ohio it may men that some 350 youth received \neither inappropriate or unneeded treatment or programming. \nAs for dangerousness or the risk of recidivism, it should be noted that we do not \nknow what proportion of the population of chronic sex offenders have juvenile sex \noffender records.  The few studies on point are not conclusive.  Variables that predict \n                                                 \n24 Franklin E. Zimring, An American Travesty: Legal Responses to Adolescent Sexual Offending 64 (2004) \n  89\n\nhigh recidivism in adult male offenders, youth and being unmarried, of course, do not \nwork with a population that is all young and single. \nCaldwell’s analysis of ten studies on point produced no consistent pattern.25  Only \na few studies even try to identify factors that distinguish juvenile reoffenders from those \nwho do not and the few studies published have conflicting results. \nDr. Robert Prentky, a nationally renowned figure in the field, was retained to \nassess the Ohio DYS sex offender assessment and treatment program simply because of \nthe emphasis given to it and the resources expended for such care.  I adhere to my earlier \ncautions about the false premises of current policy regarding both the need for treatment \nand the supposed distinctive threat posed by juvenile sexual misconduct. \nAt the same time, I reaffirm the desirability of evaluating the Ohio program on its \nown terms and to that end Dr. Prentky is to be commended for he report he prepared for \nthis investigation. \nAssessment \nDr. Prentky is one of the developers of the assessment protocol used in Ohio to \nassign sex offender “Needs” assessments.  In his Report to me of October 15, 2007, Dr. \nPrentky writes: \nAlthough it was never clear to me precisely how Need classifications are \nmade, the decision appears to hinge on the Juvenile-Sex Offender \nAssessment Protocol (J-SOAP), a risk assessment instrument development \nby Prentky & Righthand (2003) for male sex offenders in age range of 12 \nto 18.  Several “J-SOAP social workers,” trained by Dr. Righthand, \ncomplete the J-SOAP while the youth are at Scioto.  Although the J-SOAP \nassesses risk, it has no cut-off scores for degree of risk.  Since Dr. \nRighthand, in her trainings, is typically adamant that ranges (i.e., Hi, \nMod., or Low) not be invented by users and that the J-SOAP should be \nthought of as a “needs assessment” as much as a risk assessment, it \nappears that the staff have avoided the use of the word “risk” in favor of \n“needs.”  \n                                                 \n25 M.F. Caldwell, What We Do Not Know About Juvenile Sexual Reoffense Risk, 7 Child Maltreatment \n291-302 (2002), we do know that sex offender recidivism is low in the teen years. \n  90\n\nI requested and received a copy of a J-SOAP-II Report.   The first 3 pages \nof the 4-page report include the Reason for Referral, Presenting Problem, \nSources of Information, Family History, Prior Criminal History, Sexual \nHistory, Social History, and Impression and Recommendations.  On page \n4, at the end of Impressions and Recommendations, the J-SOAP scores are \nlisted, followed by Program Recommendations: High Needs.  In the final \nparagraph, entitled Summarize Criteria for Program Recommendations, it \nis stated that, “John is appropriate for High Needs Sex Offender \nProgramming for the following reasons: 1. Time frame of sexual \noffending was more than 6 months, 2.  Poor management of Sexual Urges, \n3. Multiple types and acts of delinquent behavior, 4. Poor socialization \nskills, and 5. Poor management of anger.”  In-other-words, there is no \nreference to the J-SOAP in justifying classification of High Needs.  \nRather, there are five factors that are listed to explain the classification.   \nThis three-tier system of classification is needlessly confusing, since the \nuse of terms like “High, Moderate, & Low” clearly impart the notion of \nrisk, whether the word Needs is substituted or not. Confusion arises from \nthe fact that there is no clear “line in the sand” marking the boundaries of \nthe three groups, or the precise procedure for placing kids into each of the \ngroups.  The J-SOAP-II, a risk assessment scale, is integral to the intake \nprocess, but it is unclear how the results are utilized.  When directly asked \nwhat a High Needs youth “looks like” compared to a Low Needs youth, I \nwas told that High Needs kids have (a) 3 or more victims, (b) duration of \noffending that lasts 12 months or longer, (c) preoccupation with deviant \nsexual themes, (d) a history of having been sexually or physically abused, \nand (e) excessive aggression.  By contrast, a Low Needs youth would have \nthe following profile: (a) only 1 victim, (b) no weapon used, (c) 3 or less \nincidents, (d) duration of offending that lasts less than 6 months, (e) J-\nSOAP scale 1-3 scores, (f) level of aggression (instrumental v. gratuitous) \nand (g) clinical decision.  If there is a structured, uniformly-applied, \noperational procedure for rendering classifications, this appears to be it.  \n  91\n\nUltimately, it appears that classification to High, Moderate, or Low groups \nis what might be called research informed clinical judgment.  All of the \nitems listed above appear on the J-SOAP.  Thus, it appears that a clinical \ndecision was made to select a few of them for determining classification. \nIt is not clear how, if at all, the J-SOAP scale scores are factored into these \ndecisions.  Although the hand full of items listed above can be used for \nthis screening purpose, their use can not be left to individualized \njudgment.  In- other-words, all of these items would require precise \noperationalization (i.e., how do we determine “excessive” aggression or \n“level” of aggression or “preoccupation with deviant sexual themes”?).   \nStaff raised a “regional” problem.   Youth from Cleveland arrive with a \nrisk assessment already having been done and all are “high risk.”  By \ncontrast, youth from other parts of the State arrive with no risk assessment. \nDr. Prentky’s concerns in other words, are with the selective and individualized \nuse of J-SOAP classification factors as a means to assign need (or risk).  He obviously \ndoes not challenge the validity of the instrument itself, only its haphazard use.  Some \nmight challenge the instrument’s utility for risk assessment itself and argue for clinical \nassessment of a diagnosable mental illness with the youth’s crime or crimes an important \nfactor in such diagnosis. \nDr. Prentky goes on to recommend change here: \nRecommendation:  Many of these classification problems can be shed by \nusing a system that is transparent, simple, workable, and that places a \nminimal burden on risk assessment. A simple breakdown would separate \nthese youth into: A. Standard Programming, B. Special Needs (i.e., those \npresently housed in Ash at Circleville, and C. Low Risk.  This eliminates \nthe most difficult, and arguably indefensible, distinction between “High” \nand “Moderate” risk offenders.  They would all be provided Standard \nProgramming.  The only distinctions that would have to made, and for \nwhich explicit criteria would be required, would be assignments to either \na Special Needs unit (i.e., those kids with severe developmental, social or \ncognitive deficits or a major psychiatric disorder) or to a Low Risk \n  92\n\nplacement (e.g., those kids with a single, isolated offense and an otherwise \nbenign history).  This type of categorization does not avoid entirely the \nissue of risk.  It addresses risk in a way that is both programmatically \nmeaningful (separating out those kids that do not need and are unlikely to \nbenefit from intensive sex offender specific treatment) and \npsychometrically reliable (i.e., classifying the lowest risk kids is \nsomething that we can do reliably). \nWhat follows are verbatim excerpts from Dr. Prentky’s report to me with \nparticular emphasis on Circleville, which is the focal point of Ohio DYS’s sex offender \nprogram.  \n Assessment Protocol at Scioto \nThe social work staff complete the J-SOAP and Hoge & Andrews’ Youth \nLevel of Service / Case Management Inventory.  Data for completion of \nthese two tests come from the records and an interview.  These results are \nused to inform treatment planning.  In addition, a PREA scale is used to \nscreen out youth that may be particularly vulnerable to sexual assault \nwithin the population.   This scale is a product from research spawned by \nthe 2003 Federal Prison Rape Elimination Act. A substance abuse \nscreening is done using the JASAE (Juvenile Automated Substance Abuse \nEvaluation), a computer-assisted evaluation developed by Bryan Ellis. In \naddition, the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument (MAYSI), \ndeveloped by Grisso and Barnum, is completed.  \nRecommendations:  The existing protocol is fine.   I would complement \nit, however, with a number of additional structured questionnaires that \nelicit feedback around targets areas of great concern:  (a) a detailed abuse /  \nmaltreatment history that asks not simply about the presence of a history \nof sexual abuse (as one example) but about all morbidity factors \nassociated with the abuse, including a complete chronology of caregivers, \n(b) Briere’s Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children / Trauma Symptom \nInventory – depending on the age of the youth; evaluating current signs \nand symptoms associated with abuse-related trauma is critical for \n  93\n\ninformed decisions about treatment, (c) a comprehensive, structured \nsexual history inventory, (d) one of several good questionnaires that have \nbeen developed for adolescents to assess the experience, intensity, and \ncontrol / management of angry feelings, and (e) neuropsychological \nscreening that briefly assesses neurocognitive deficits, including \nfunctional reading ability and comprehension.  All of these areas of \nassessment are essential for developing an informed, tailored plan that \ntreats all facets of a youngster’s functioning. \nAvailability of resources must be addressed. I heard the issue of resources \nraised many times by staff.  Ms. Williams, social work supervisor for \nmales at Scioto, observed that the number of youth arriving at Scioto has \ntripled, from an average of 2-3/month to a current average of 10 / month. \nThis past July, the intake was 16. Another staff member commented that, \n“As you draw up the census, you must draw up the resources.  This has \nnot happened.”   Adding the above suggested testing places the greatest \ntime demand on the youth themselves, with the obvious exception of \nneurocognitive testing.  I would estimate an additional 3 hours of time for \neach youngster, plus an additional 1-2 hours for a supervised, MA-level \npsychologist. Realistically, the additional required resources would be \nanother MA-level psychologist who is capable of administering and \ninterpreting neurocognitive tests for adolescents, and the purchase fees for \nthe tests themselves. \nCircleville Visit \nAs noted, I spent two full days at the Circleville Juvenile Correctional \nFacility.  I met with Thomas Teague (Superintendent), Rose Harmon \n(Executive Assistant to the Superintendent), Larry Alessio (Deputy \nSuperintendent and Director of Security), “Doc” Blackburn (Deputy \nSuperintendent for Finance), Linda Gable (Sex Offender Coordinator), \nTrecia Holdren (Social Work Supervisor), and Dr. Barbara Scott Johnson. \nI also met privately with several groups of youngsters representing both \nthe middle age (14-16) and older (17-19) kids, and separately with their \n  94\n\nunit therapists.  In addition, I met with a range of line therapists and \nclinicians (e.g., Mr. Smith, Dr. Lagregory, Ms. Brisbine, Dr. Garbrecht).  \nAlthough the census ranges from 144 to 156, at the time I was there, the \ncensus was “down” (133).  There are six housing units with 24 beds on \neach unit, except for Ash, which has 20 beds.  There are two housing units \nper building: Ash + Elm; Oak + Walnut; Hickory + Maple.  The first two \nbuildings (Ash & Elm and Oak & Walnut) have three social workers each \nand Hickory & Maple has four social workers.  Hence, the resident to \ntherapist ratio ranges from 12:1 on Hickory & Maple to 16:1 on Oak & \nWalnut.  In addition to the ten social workers assigned to the units, there \nare four psychologists (two doctoral-level and two Masters-level) who \nprovide “roving” services, as requested, to the residents at large.  \nPsychiatric services are contracted out to Ohio State University. \n**** \nProgramming \nThe program at Circleville has three phases.  Each phase is described in a \ndetailed 3-ring binder of information that was made available to me.  The \nphases, simply stated, are 1. Informational, 2. Offense/Cycle, & 3. Relapse \nPrevention Plan.  Advancing from one phase to another involves a post-\ntest as well as appearance before a transition panel.  The passing score on \nthe test to move to the next phase is 70-75%.  Phase III takes, on average \n4-6 months to complete, though some motivated kids can complete it in 3-\n4 months.  The entire program is designed to be completed in 12-18 \nmonths, though youngsters, if sufficiently motivated, can complete the \nprogram in 12 months.   Ordinarily, movement through the various levels \nof a program, from point of entry to pre-release, is clearly explicated, with \nconcrete goals and objectives for each phase and transitions that routinely \nfollow completion of those goals and objectives.  Those goals and \nobjectives must be clearly understood by the kids. \nRecommendation:  The psychotherapeutic component of the program is \nconsistent with what is provided elsewhere for juvenile sex offenders. It \n  95\n\nappears to be well thought out and appropriately implemented.  I would \nonly recommend, because of its obvious importance, that the goals and \nobjectives at each phase be addressed with each youngster in group or \nindividually and that the youngster be required to state in his own words \nwhat is required of him. The only aspect of the therapeutic part of \nprogramming that is neglected is childhood abuse and trauma.  I spoke \nwith Dr. Garbrecht, who runs SOS groups.  Survivors of Sexual Abuse \n(SOS) is a time-limited (10-11 weeks), voluntary process group that \nincludes a manual and homework.  The group is provided to very few kids \nand requires a sexual abuse history.  Everyone who comes to Circleville \nshould be evaluated for childhood history of abuse and trauma of any kind \nand provided, if deemed appropriate, intensive, focal treatment for their \nabuse.  In addition to appropriate screening (e.g., the TSCC) and process \ngroups, the facility should have at least one FT trained trauma therapist on \nstaff who can recognize symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and is skilled at treating it (including EMDR).  \n**** \nPrivilege System     \nThe privilege system has three levels: Basic, Additional, and Exceptional.  \nI requested and received a print out of the privilege assignments.   Of the \n132 kids assigned with privilege status, 37.9% were Basic, 25% were \nAdditional, and 37% were Exceptional.  Facility wide, 37% assigned to \nthe highest level of privilege is not unreasonable.  If one looks at the \nbreakdown by living unit, however, it is again noteworthy that Ash (and \nHickory) have the lowest proportion of kids (22% & 19% respectively) \nwith Exceptional privilege status.  By contrast, Elm, Maple, Oak, and \nWalnut have between 40% - 50% of their kids with Exceptional privilege \nstatus. \nPerhaps the more meaningful question, however, is the effectiveness of the \nprivilege system.   All youngsters that I spoke with who had anything to \nsay about the privileges available to them uniformly reported that the \n  96\n\nprivileges were trivial and effectively meaningless as external motivators \nto do their work.  It is easy to generate numerous examples of highly \ncoveted rewards for teenage boys, including a recreation room with music, \ntelevision or a movie-dedicated screen, pool table, etc; wider range of \nchoices of movies, including excellent educational movies that can be \nserve a dual psychotherapeutic role; a wider range of channels that can be \naccessed on their living unit TVs; a commissary with a much wider range \nof sought after products; their own kitchen and the opportunity to prepare \ntheir own meals (again, doubling as a practical life skill / training); \nteenage-friendly meals in the cafeteria, such as pizza and hamburgers, and \naccess to therapeutic community programs. \nRecommendation:  Because of the potential power of such privileges as \nmotivators, as well as vehicles for skill-building and therapy, I recommend \nthat an entire building be designated as Exceptional privilege.  Each \nbuilding has 48 beds in total.  Excluding Ash, there are already 45 kids \nclassified as Exceptional.  They could be placed in one building and that \nbuilding converted into a therapeutic community with many of the above-\nmentioned privileges provided.  The goal should be to convert all units \ninto therapeutic communities and strive to have two-thirds of the kids at \nExceptional privilege status.   \nTherapist Contact Time \nThe prison or institution-based treatment programs that I am acquainted \nexpect, in some cases require, anywhere from 15 to 20 hours/wk of \nclinical contact time for therapists.  This means that roughly half of the \ntherapist’s time is spent engaged in contact with the kids (e.g., running \nprocess groups, facilitating “house” or therapeutic community meetings, \nteaching psychoeducational classes, participating in therapy progress \nreview panels or committees, tutoring those taking psychoeducational \nclasses, doing individual behavior therapy, etc.).   I was disturbed by \ncomments from some of the kids about the unavailability of clinicians.  A \n  97\n\nboy stated, “Some kids will go on suicide watch just for someone to pay \nattention to you and talk to you.”   \nRecommendation: Clinicians should be required to log their clinical \ncontact time and demonstrate, as noted above, a minimum of 15-20 hours / \nweek providing direct service.  \nRelease \nRelease consists of four elements: 1. completing the “judge’s time” (the \nminimum to serve time given at adjudication), 2. completing all 3 phases \nof the program, 3. availability of a placement, and 4. a staffing. Staffing, \nwhich occurs toward the end or at the end of Phase II, take place at the \nDYS Regional Office. In addition to a member of the Release Authority in \nDYS Central Office and a parole officer and placement coordinator from \nthe appropriate parole region, staffing may include a victim services \ncoordinator, the assigned social worker, and parents or guardians.    \nThe Release Plan requires many tasks: 1. linking up with therapy and \nmedication in the community, 2. appropriate housing, 3. job placement, 4. \nobtaining a copy of one’s birth certificate, 5. setting up MR / DD services, \nif applicable, 6. obtaining a Medical / Medicaid card, if eligible, 7. \nobtaining a State ID, 8. obtaining a Social Security card, 9. submitting \npaperwork for SSI / SSDI, if eligible, 10. obtaining a Learner’s Permit \nfrom the DMV, if eligible,  and 11. arranging for services from the Bureau \nof Vocational Rehabilitation.  Although Re-entry teams from the \ncommunity (mentors) visit the facility, most of this work is done off-site at \nDYS Regional Office.   \nRecommendation: This entire process appears to be needlessly \ncumbersome.  I recommend that this entire process be accomplished “in \nhouse” (at the facility) and orchestrated by a release team at Circleville  \nwith the explicit mission of facilitating and streamlining a smooth return \nand optimally healthy readjustment in the community.  It is the \nyoungster’s life that is being pieced together.  He deserves to be integrally \ninvolved at every step in designing this plan.  It should not be done “from \n  98\n\nafar” and then handed to him as a fait accompli. The bridge from prison \nback to society must be erected jointly and paved as smoothly and as \nsensitively (to the needs of the youth) as possible.  Additionally, the J-\nSOAP does not appear to be part of this release process.  Since it is \nadministered at the beginning, it would make sense to re-administer it \n(Scales 3 & 4) at the end. Overall, it did not seem as though the J-SOAP \nwas being used in any programmatic way that warranted its inclusion.                     \nMiscellaneous: \nStaff Training and Supervision \nTherapists complained to me about the lack of staff training.  Apparently, \nall staff receive a 3 week “pre-service” designed for everyone (i.e., the \ntraining is not around therapy).  In addition, there is a one-week in-service \nevery year for clinical staff.   Several clinicians stated, in no uncertain \nterms, that this was not adequate and that they often felt that they did not \nknow what they were doing.   \n Clinical supervision is extraordinarily important in a program such as this, \nnot only because of the challenging nature of the individuals being treated \nbut because of the often disturbing material that comes up in therapy and \nthe conditions under which treatment takes place.  A high priority should \nbe placed on good staff supervision, not only to improve the quality of \ntreatment provided but to protect clinicians from burn out.   \nRecommendation:  All clinicians hired to treat kids at Circleville must be \nminimally prepared at the outset, reaching at least minimal best-practice \nstandards.  Therapists should be well grounded not merely in the mode of \ntreatment (cognitive-behavior therapy), but in boundaries, sensitivity (i.e., \nsensitivity training), normal adolescent development, normal sexuality, \nand degrees of deviant sexuality. With regard to supervision, I recommend \nthat all therapists have one hour of supervision each week, as well as \nparticipating in a supervision group once a week or once every two weeks.  \nI would also recommend that non-therapy staff also be afforded \nsupervision, though on a less frequent basis.   The therapists should be \n  99\n\nviewed as change agents, and, as such, the efficacy of the program hinges, \nin part, on their competence, if not their expertise.  \n[End Prentky Report] \n \nFinally, to the extent that DYS wishes to rethink the extent of its commitment to \nthe current sex offender treatment program, I would suggest that any Settlement in this \nproceeding include a provision requiring a study of the adjudication and disposition of \nfirst-time sex offenders; the presence of sexual paraphilia in the sentenced sex offender \npopulation, and the accuracy of assessments of dangerousness for that same population.  \nUltimately, the questions should be whether those juveniles who are truly dangerous are \nproperly dealt with; are those who need, or would benefit from, treatment receiving it; \nand may those without a clinical diagnosis requiring treatment be released from current \ntreatment-program obligations. \n \n \n \n  100\n\nVI.  EDUCATION \n \nWhat follows, with a few editorial massages, is the summary of the full report \nentitled, Review of Education Programs Provided to Juvenile Offenders in Ohio \nDepartment of Youth Services Juvenile Correctional Facilities, which is appended as part \nof Appendix D.  This obviously is less than the full report and more than the executive \nsummary attached to it. \nYou will find Ava Crow’s summary unsettling, even disheartening.  With the \nexception of kudos for the new Superintendent, there’s not much here to provide comfort \nfor readers looking to grasp something positive. \nThe formula for education in DYS appears to be: Those with the greatest need, \nreceive the least help. There are deficits in teaching staff, failure to comply with state and \nfederal laws on point, limited space, and limited help with vocational training or post-\nsecondary education opportunities. \nTeachers are fearful and stress leave is all too common. \nNo one asserts that teaching these youth in what is a correctional, prison-like \nsetting is easy.  Quite the contrary.  However, as the “Crow Report” depressingly shows, \nthose with the greatest need continue to be to those with the greatest need. \nThe full Report is compelling, perhaps mandatory, reading for everyone involved \nin this litigation.  The Summary, which follows, is a must: \nLeadership and Organizational Structure \n“Education programs in juvenile correctional facilities are the key \nfactor in assuring that students have the tools needed for successful \ntransition back into the community…Studies have shown that the potential \nfor recommitment drops when students in juvenile correctional facilities \nseriously address their education needs.”26  “Education is an essential \ncomponent of treatment and rehabilitation for incarcerated youth and is the \nfoundation for programming in many juvenile institutions (citation \nomitted).  Helping youth acquire educational skills is one of the most \n                                                 \n26 John Stewart, Ed.D, A Special Edition on Education Programs in Juvenile Correctional Facilities 53 \nJournal of Correctional Education #2, (6/02).   \n  101\n\neffective approaches to the…reduction of recidivism…Higher levels of \nliteracy are associated with lower (rates of) juvenile delinquency, rearrest \nand recidivism.”27   \nEducation, historically a local concern, has become much more \n“federalized.” No Child Left Behind (NCLB), an omnibus education \nstatute, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) require \nthat educators apply science, rather than instinct, to their teaching.  \nEducation is now a scientific profession, and requires the leadership of \neducation professionals.28  By hiring a new energetic school \nsuperintendent, DYS has taken an important step in moving the school \ndistrict forward, but it has a long way to go.  Using NCLB data, the district \nis designated by the Ohio Department of Education as “in Academic \nEmergency.”29  To transform this school district into an effective \neducational agency, the new Superintendent will need much assistance, \nand DYS must make substantial changes in its organizational structure and \nmanagement style. 30\nDYS has a “top down” management style that allows some \nimportant educational decisions to be made without input from the Bureau \nor school staff.  Information was received that school officials were not \nconsulted in the decision to change from an eight period to a six period \nday, but this is sharply denied by ODYS officials. School officials are \nsharply divided on the merits of this decision but unified on its major \nimpact on the delivery of educational services.  Regardless of which side \n                                                 \n27 Peter E. Leone, Ph.D., Sheri M. Meisel, Will Drakeford Special Education Programs for Youth with \n  \nDisabilities in Juvenile Corrections 53 Journal of Correctional Education #2 (6/02).  \n28 The NCLB statute references “research” or “research based” more than 200 times.  For example, local \nschool districts must assure the U. S. Department of Education that they will take into account “the findings \nof relevant scientifically based research,” and that they will implement school wide reform strategies that \n“use effective methods and instructional strategies that are based on scientifically based research.”   IDEA \nhas similarly changed its focus to providing services based on science.  “(S) Scientific, research-based \ninterventions may be used as a tool to identify specific learning disabilities.   The students’ IEPs are to \ncontain “statement(s) of the (student’s)… services, based on peer-reviewed research to the extent \npracticable…”   \n29 Department of Youth Services 2006-07 School Year Report Card, http://www.ode.state.oh.us/reportcard \n30 See OAC 3301-30-01(B); 3301-35-11(C). \n  102\n\nthey may take, all believe that additional input from education officials \nwould have resulted in a better decision.     \nThe non-inclusive nature of top down management extends to the \nhighest levels of DYS.  Reportedly, Bureau administrators are involved \nonly by invitation in many agency-wide decisions that directly or \nindirectly impact school services. For DYS to appropriately serve \nstudents, it should ensure that the Superintendent be at every central office \nmeeting where decisions are being made that even tangentially touch on \neducation. \nThe DYS organizational structure does not give the Bureau direct \nauthority to manage the schools. Despite statutory mandates, the school \nsuperintendent does not assign school personnel or evaluate the school \nprincipals.  As a result, the Bureau has perhaps even less power with \nindividual schools than it has in Central Office.  In some instances, there \nare active efforts to circumvent Bureau directives.  One Bureau \nadministrator, in talking about the schools, states, “I am just like a gnat \nthat they swat away.”   \nThere is evidence of the truth of this statement.  One principal, at \nstaff meetings is reported to say about Bureau directives, “This comes \nfrom Columbus.  They are only here six days a year, so we won’t worry \ntoo much about this.”31  In another example, in mid-August 2007, Bureau \nadministrators were alarmed to informally discover the existence of a \nprotective custody (PC) unit.  Record review reveals that students had \nbeen in this unit since at least July 5, 2007.  At the time of discovery, 25 \nyouth resided on this unit, 22 of whom were students, and 15 of whom \n                                                 \n31 The principal denies this statement, noting that he understands how “things can be misperceived.”  \nHowever, a teacher very supportive of the principal, when asked about the statement, replied, “I won’t say \nhe hasn’t said it,” and continued by explaining that staff members were  weary of directives from \nColumbus. \n  103\n\nrequire special education. Not one of these students was receiving \neducational services until discovery by the Bureau.32\nIn addition to the Bureau lacking authority, interviews establish \nthat institutional interests at the facilities sometimes impair efforts to \nprovide educational programming.  If there is a conflict between providing \nappropriate educational services for students and meeting other \ninstitutional needs or preferences, the other institutional needs and \npreferences prevail all too often. One example is at Luther Ball \n(Cuyahoga) where space is at a premium and school administrators and \nguidance counselors share offices. Two unit psychologists have private \noffices located in the school’s administrative hall, and although there are \ninsufficient classrooms to offer additional electives, a large classroom was \ntaken over for medical services.  Additionally a four-room module that \ncould be used to provide electives or special education is being used for \ngroup.  There are also two dorms that have been empty for an extended \nperiod of time because of staffing and are currently being used as a game \nroom and for programming.  One or both could be opened for career tech \nclasses or alternatively, used for some of the program offices and services \ncurrently located in the school.  Reportedly facility administrators are \ncontemplating changes, but at the time of the site visit, the situation was as \nis reported.    \nIn another example, the principal of a school was informed by the \nfacility superintendent that one of his best teachers should report to a \nclassroom that had been set up outside the school building for students on \nunit restriction.  Neither this principal nor any other educator had any \ninvolvement in determining an appropriate way to educationally serve \nthese students, in creating this classroom, or in determining which teacher \nwould be most appropriate to handle an alternative classroom setting.  No \nconsideration was given to the consequences to the school of moving this \n                                                 \n32 Students on PC require a safety plan.  Record review revealed that safety plans were written several days \nto several weeks after the students had been placed in PC.  For example, one student was place in PC on \nJuly 5, yet his safety plan was not written until August 7, 2007, shortly before the site visit. \n  104\n\nteacher out of the building.  Although there is a new director and facility \nsuperintendent, the original structure that allowed such a decision is still in \nplace.  \nAs a final organizational impediment, several principals reference \ninstitutional responsibilities that detract from their instructional leadership \nduties.  These responsibilities include completing administrative duty \nofficer responsibilities, participating in training not directly related to \nmanaging the school, conducting investigations and serving on \ninterdisciplinary committee hearings.  While it may not be appropriate to \nrelieve school principals of all of these responsibilities, consideration \nshould be given to limiting them.   \nIn sum, while DYS is to be commended for its ongoing efforts to \nstrengthen education, its organizational structure does not facilitate that \ngoal.  Accountability cannot be established if the Bureau remains impotent \nin addressing educational issues. If DYS schools are to ever successfully \nmeasure achievement by the quantity of student learning, the Bureau must \nbe empowered and principals must function as instructional leaders.   \nWhile facility administrators need to maintain an ownership \ninterest in school services within their facilities, the Bureau of Education \nmust be in charge of education and be given oversight responsibilities for \nthe schools.  Recommendations in the full education report are designed to \naddress these issues.   \nFull School Day and Staffing \nDYS fails to meet its responsibilities as a “parent” under Ohio’s \ncompulsory attendance statute and fails to meet the statutory requirement \nto provide a full school day.33  Scioto River (Scioto reception for boys) \nand the Freedom Center offer three hours or less of education to their \n                                                 \n33 There is not agreement on what constitutes a full school day.  DYS reports that its SOP providing, “The \nschool day…shall consist of scheduled classes, supervised activities or approved options for at least six \nhours” means that schools must operate for six hours per day but does not provide an entitlement to \nindividual students for six hours of educational services.  Even granting great deference to the agency in its \ninterpretation, OAC 3301-35-06 requires at least 5.5 hours of programming, and for this report, that figure \nis used as the measure of a “full school day.” \n  105\n\nstudents.  On paper, it appears that all other DYS schools provide a full \nschool day for all students.  In fact, that is not the case.  Teacher shortages \nare an overwhelming issue, and no DYS school is immune.  Limited \nclassroom space and the logistics of providing unit instruction are also \nmajor problems.   \nOn a randomly selected, given day, through review of student \nlocators, 598 or 43% of DYS youth received less than a full day of school.  \nTo demonstrate the impact on actual student lives one only needs to look \nat the numbers revealed on the 8/14/07 Hickory Grove (Marion) student \nlocator report.  Eleven students, mostly housed on unit six lost 100% of \ntheir class time for three days, for a total of 66 missed classes.  One \nhundred and ten class periods were missed by 83 students for whom there \nwas no teacher on that particular day.  These students lost 22% of their \nclass time on that day.  And finally six students housed on the Marion \nmental health unit were found to be getting only three 50-minute periods \nper day; one half the number offered to other students.   \nLack of a teacher or substitute is a common reason cited for loss of \nclass time.  Teacher staffing is a chronic and debilitating concern. Twenty-\nthree teaching positions were reported vacant in August 2007.  Some \nschools report a chronic shortage of three to four teachers. At Luther Ball \n(Cuyahoga), multiple classes were cancelled during a six-month period \ndue to teacher vacancies. At the time of the site visit, Hickory Grove \n(Marion) had four teacher vacancies which included library, science, \nEnglish and special education. The English vacancy is especially \nproblematic since it has been open since December 2006.  Two hundred of \nthe total 270 students are 9th and 10th graders, yet Hickory Grove has not \nhad an English teacher for these grades for eight calendar months. There \nwas no science class at Scioto River for a school term because of a \nvacancy.  The Starkey AOT class at Circleville did not meet for three \nweeks because the teacher was in training.  At Tecumseh (ORV) the short \nstaffing problem is reported to be cyclical.  One guidance counselor \n  106\n\nobserves that the school is fully staffed from January to June and short \nstaffed from July to October or November because teachers leave for the \npublic school systems in June and it takes four to five months to replace \nthem.  \nWhen substitutes are not available, librarians, guidance counselors \nand assistant principals are pulled to cover classes.  Additionally, special \neducation teachers are pulled out of their planning periods, and some are \npulled from their resource classrooms to cover general education classes.  \nThese measures result in classes that are of questionable educational \nvalue, in addition to having a detrimental effect on the overall operation of \nthe school.  Despite these efforts, many classes must be cancelled due to \nlack of sufficient staff.  Rather than sending the students back to the unit, \nsome school administrators move the students to the library or in the case \nof at least two schools, move them to a sterile holding room where no \neducational activity occurs.  In one hour at Hickory Grove at Marion, the \nholding room census soared to 76 (40 graduates and 36 students). Not \nsurprisingly, the holding room was the scene of more than a few \ndisturbances.  On a day at Indian River when four teachers were absent, \nthe shortage of substitutes necessitated one teacher’s class reporting to the \nholding room throughout the day. \nSchool administrators report that teacher stress contributes \ndramatically to their inability to staff a full educational day.  At more than \none school, principals explained that they fully expect teaching staff to use \nall their leave days due the stressful working conditions, and some \nteachers then obtain extended leave through the Family and Medical \nLeave Act or unpaid leave.  Assaults of teachers requiring hospital care \nare not unusual at some of the facilities, and the stress and physical \ninjuries combined result in extensive teacher absences that must be \ncovered.  School budgets do not cover the actual cost of necessary \nsubstitute teachers.  \n  107\n\nAn additional contributory factor causing short staffing is the \ninordinate length of time from hiring to the actual day that a teacher \nbegins to teach.  Principals estimate that the whole process of recruiting, \nhiring, and pre-service training takes no less than three months and can \nextend to five months.  Education administrators point out that much of \nthe pre-service training is of limited relevance to school staff.  Valuable \ntime spent in this orientation could be more effectively spent to meet \nschool staffing needs. \nLack of school space at some facilities is an additional contributory \nfactor in failing to provide all students with a full school day. Tecumseh at \nORV is currently almost 70 students over school capacity, meaning that \nfew, if any, students are receiving a full school day.  An administrator at \nTecumseh explains, “We don’t physically have enough seats or teachers to \ngive everyone six classes (of 50 minutes each). If the number of classes \nfor any youth drops to four, he goes on a waiting list until he can get what \nhe needs.  Right now there are 3 new youth on the waiting list who need \n10th grade English.  English is full.  Four youth that came in July did not \nhave the necessary five classes34 and they were also on the wait list.”  The \nnew classification system continues to overload Tecumseh at ORV and \nHickory Grove at Marion, contributing to a decreased school day at each \nfacility.  \nStudents with challenges such as mental illness or severe behavior \nproblems are often housed on specialty units or in isolation. The \neducational experience for many of these students often consists of no \nmore than a worksheet slipped under a locked cell door.  By even the most \noptimistic estimates, the educational day on these isolation units does not \ncome close to meeting the requirement of a full school day. \nThere are occasions when even token education does not occur for \nstudents in isolation or on the units. Hickory Grove (Marion) students lost \n                                                 \n34 This official believes that 250 minutes of instruction is the minimum requirement.  As discussed at Note \n8, it appears that the law requires at least 5.5 hours of instruction. \n  108\n\n3,725 hours of education in a school quarter because of students being \nplaced in isolation. In addition, the students in the Marion mental health \nunit receive only three hours of instruction per day, and this is decreased \nwhen the special education teacher is pulled to cover general education \nclassrooms. At Luther Ball at Cuyahoga Hills seven students have Special \nManagement Plans (SMPs) that require them to remain on the unit, usually \nfor five days, with school work dropped off.  To the extent there is any \n“instruction,” it is provided by a JCO. At Tecumseh (ORV), 18 students \nhoused in the Grant Unit receive only four classes per day.  \n“The education of our youth is intimately tied to crime and \ndelinquency rates.”35  Since it is likely that many or all DYS officials \nwould unequivocally agree with this statement, it is incomprehensible that \nthese same officials would tolerate anything less than a full day of school \nfor all the youth entrusted to their care.  \nSpecial Education \nThe current version of the federal special education statute, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA), \nreflects 30 years of pedagogical advances and refinements in the process \nof providing educational services for students with disabilities.  Over half \nof DYS students are protected under this statute, yet teachers often view \nIDEA as yet another paperwork burden. Minimal regard is given to the \nsubstantive provisions of the statute. This view and the antecedent failure \nto fully implement Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) are two of \nthe most disturbing facets of DYS non-compliance with the IDEA. \nFor the special education student to receive the benefit of the IEP, \nthe document must provided individualized services.  All education \nprofessionals must commit to implementation, to detailed monitoring of \nprogress, and to using the monitoring data to evaluate progress.  Review of \nIEPs and interviews with DYS teachers reveal that “special education” is \n                                                 \n35 Marisa Ostroff, Ed.D., Educational Attainment and Delinquency:  What Goes Up Brings the Other \nDown   7 Juvenile Correctional Mental Health Report #2, p. 21 (Jan/Feb 2007). \n \n  109\n\nalmost solely limited to “extended time” and “small group instruction.” \nThese benefits are provided to all DYS students.  Only a very few teachers \nsupplement these modifications or provide additional supplementary aids \nand services in accordance with a truly individualized education plan. The \nfollowing comments by DYS teachers reflect the predominant attitudes \nabout special education:   \n•  At Indian River, a special education teacher states, “I don’t always go look \nat the IEP when a student gets here.  There are 8-10 coming and going \nevery month.”  The teacher continues by noting that in teaching, “I shoot \nfor 3rd-4th grade level; you can’t individualize.”  Regarding monitoring \ndata, a special education teacher states, “I ask the regular education \nteachers, “What is he doing and how is his behavior,” and this information \nis requested “only when a new IEP is due—I don’t have enough time to do \nit any other time.”  A general education teacher notes, “I think the special \neducation teachers spend a lot of time writing IEPs that do not get read.”  \n•  At Tecumseh (ORV), a general education teacher states, “I have never \nbeen asked for progress on IEP goals.”  Another general education teacher \nstates, “Progress may be general or specific.”  A special education teacher \nnotes, “Probably now progress data is (sic) based more on lesson plans, \nbut we’re moving towards IEP goals.”   \n•  At Luther Ball (Cuyahoga), a special education teacher notes that there are \ngeneral education teachers “who don’t know their special education \nstudents.”  A general education teacher explains that he “didn’t typically \nget IEPs,” doesn’t know if he can access them electronically and has never \nbeen asked for progress data. \n•  One particularly challenged general education teacher states that “generic \nconcepts” are taught in the class; noting that all youth “get the same folder \nthat is not on their level” because individualizing student work is too \ndifficult.  This teacher notes that students will, from time to time, argue \nabout the work and what their IEP goals require, but the teacher explains \nthat it is simply too difficult to address these issues. \n  110\n\n•  Another particularly challenged general education teacher, found in the \nhallway, explained his presence by stating that a collaborating special \neducation teacher was currently with his class.  He then stated that he \n“didn’t really know if it was his class” noting that “the special education \nteacher acted like it was her class, so maybe it was,” but he thought it was \nhis.   \n•  Several general education teachers, although aware of their students’ IEPs \nnevertheless teach those students from the class lesson plans.  A couple of \nthese teachers note that they make sure their students “get their special \neducation—extra time to complete work and a small group.” \nAnother significant area of non-compliance relates to the federal \nstatute’s mandates related to behavior and changes of educational \nplacements.  To shape student behavior, schools use SMPs rather than the \nfederally mandated behavior intervention plans based on functional \nbehavioral assessments.  In clear violation of federal law, DYS IEP teams \nnever use the mandated procedures for disciplinary changes of placement. \nAt Tecumseh (ORV), school administrators or teachers make \nplacements into the Alternate Learning Center (ALC) for school-related \nbehavior. After 10 days of compliant behavior, the student returns to the \nregular school setting, but if a YBIR is written within a specified period of \ntime, the student automatically returns to the ALC.  Tecumseh is under the \nmisperception that placement in the ALC is not a “change of placement” \nbecause the students’ general education teachers bring work over to the \nALC each period and the students remain on the general education \nteachers’ class rolls.  The teacher in the ALC is a highly qualified teacher \n(HQT) special education teacher.  While this situation presents a good \neffort to stay within the change of placement rules without actually using \nthe required process, it does not comply with IDEA.  In determining \nwhether the rules apply, the issue is whether the student’s learning \nexperiences are significantly changed. ALC students are forced to leave \nthe general education classrooms at the school building and move to a unit \n  111\n\nclassroom where their interactions are limited to the other students placed \nthere.  They do not change classes and although a general education \nteacher is present each class period, s/he is also serving the students in \nindividual cells, and the primary responsibility for instruction in the ALC \nrests on the HQT special education teacher.  The ALC is designed to be \nmore restrictive than the school building, and thus, by definition, \nplacement constitutes a ”change of placement.”  Calling the ALC teacher a \ncollaborating teacher and leaving the students on the rolls of the general \neducation teachers do not change this fact. \nEach “change of placement,” when accomplished for school-\nrelated behavioral problems and cumulating to more than 10 days in a \nschool year is almost always an occasion when institutional correctional \npolicy is being used to override and violate federal education law.  \nNot only is the IEP team the sole “decider” of educational changes \nof placement, if the change is a disciplinary change resulting from the \nstudent’s behavior in the school, a specific process must be followed. This \nprocess is designed to ensure that students not be excluded from the school \nbuilding for behavior related to their disability. Generally, a student cannot \nbe moved to a disciplinary educational placement for more than 10 days \nunless an IEP team meeting is convened and a determination is made \nabout whether the student’s behavior in the school results from his \ndisability.  The IEP team must consider the completion of a functional \nbehavioral assessment and a behavior intervention plan for the student.  If \nthe IEP team determines that the student’s behavior is a manifestation of \nthe student’s disability, the student usually may not be suspended from the \nschool program for more than 10 days per school year; the student must \nremain in or be returned to the educational setting where the behavior \noccurred; and the student’s behavior must be addressed by modifying the \nspecially designed instruction and supplementary aids and services \nprovided to the student. The disciplinary changes of placement rules are \ncomplicated, and a Flow Chart is attached as Appendix II to the full \n  112\n\neducation report.  The only thing immediately crystal clear is that these \nchanges of placement decisions are education decisions to be made by IEP \nteams and are not decisions to be made, as they now are, by facility \nadministration, IATs, treatment teams or psychologists.  Although several \ninterviewees present persuasive reasons for the existing change of \nplacement practices, they nevertheless violate IDEA.   DYS must address \nthese placement issues in a manner consistent with federal law.   \nThe failure to provide students with individualized IEPs that are \ncollaboratively developed in IEP team meetings with appropriate members \npresent violates IDEA.  The failure to teach to the IEP goals and the \nfailure to appropriately and accurately monitor progress violate IDEA.  \nThe failure to use positive behavioral interventions in behavior \nintervention plans and the failure to use the mandated procedures for \ndisciplinary changes of placement all violate IDEA. \nOther major areas of non-compliance with the federal statute are \ndiscussed in the full education report, and recommendations are made.  \nThe DYS school system has made substantial progress in addressing \nminimal legal compliance with some IDEA mandates.  But to effectively \neducate the special students protected by IDEA, partial compliance is \ncertainly not enough. \nInstructional Practices and Discipline \nThe entire DYS school system struggles with the problem of \ninconsistency in discipline.  Effective teachers have far fewer discipline \nreferrals than the less effective teachers.  Additionally, administrators \nexpress frustration at the “quick trigger” of some teachers, who invariably \nare the more challenged teachers.  After seven weeks of an eight-week \ngrading period at Indian River, the number of In School Suspension (ISS) \nreferrals ranged from one to five for some teachers up to 60 and 70 for \nothers.  The total of ISS referrals for those weeks was 917.  The principal \nof Luther Ball (Cuyahoga) related that four teachers call for help more \n  113\n\noften than the rest of the combined teaching staff. These trends are \nmirrored throughout the DYS system. \nAdministrators were asked to identify their most and least effective \nteachers, and these teachers were then observed and/or interviewed. Those \nidentified as successful teachers issued the fewest YBIRs and ISS \nreferrals.  These teachers followed detailed lesson plans and employed a \nvariety of methods to present the material to students. Their students were \nengaged and appeared to be content.   \nThe less effective teachers issued the most YBIRs and ISS \nreferrals.  Their lesson plans often consisted of no more than a page \nnumber and an assignment.  These teachers were observed to have the \nleast amount of content in their lesson.  The majority of these teachers \nrelied on individual seat work, with worksheets and little or no instruction. \nIn these situations, each student got his own folder and when he had a \nquestion, he was to wait patiently until the teacher had time to help him.  \nThis method delivered information to students who already understood the \nsubject matter.  They were observed to work through the lesson in the first \n20 or 30 minutes and then they finished and were ready to get into \nmischief.  For students who were having difficulty or appeared totally lost, \nthe experience was extremely frustrating.  When help finally arrived, the \nteacher frequently was observed to share a few words with the student \n(often, the answer to the worksheet question, with minimal, if any, \ninstruction as to why it was the answer), and the teacher would then move \nto the next student who was calling out or raising a hand.  The student \noften appeared to be as perplexed as before the “help” arrived.  \nThrough its Character Counts program, DYS encourages the use of \npositive reinforcement.  However punitive actions far outnumber any \npositive rewards.  During the month of April, Indian River identified a \ntotal of 766 violations and wrote only 49 Commendable Conduct reports.  \nIn July 2007, Hickory Grove (Marion) reported 1323 violations while only \none Commendable Conduct report was written.  Tecumseh (ORV) also \n  114\n\nreported over 900 YBIRs in one month and a very small number of \nCommendable Conduct reports.   \nInterviews with principals and review of professional evaluations \nreveal that school administrators are fully aware of the ineffective \nteachers.  With some exceptions, principals utilize evaluations to put \nteachers on notice of needed improvement.  If quality instruction is to be \ndelivered to students, it is imperative that administrators’ focus \nconcentrated energy on improving the instructional practices of teachers \nalready identified as ineffective. \nWhile school culture and classroom management skills have a \ndramatic impact on student behavior, other institutional factors contribute \nto the safety concerns of teachers.  Chaos and unrest initiated in areas \noutside the school were observed to carry over into the classroom, to the \ndetriment of all students. Sixty-two percent of all teachers express \ndissatisfaction with school safety.36  Interviews with staff reveal \nwidespread concern about the increasing prevalence of gang activity in the \nstudent population.  When questioned about the nature of the gang \nactivity, one assistant principal familiar with gang dynamics, explained \nthat the gang leaders remain in the background, giving  assignments to \nyouth wishing to be identified with a certain gang.  A typical assignment \nmay be to perform a “hit” on another youth.  An especially competent \nEnglish teacher at Tecumseh (ORV) expressed her frustration at the \nnumber of “hits” that occurred in her classroom in one month.  Each of \nthese incidents occurred during hall movement when a fledgling gang \nmember would dart into her classroom and hit another student. The \nteacher explained that when these disruptions occurred in her classroom, \nthe first ten minutes of the class were spent with the JCOs breaking up the \nfight and cleaning up blood.  She knew that the students would not be, \nshall we say, quite as focused as she would like for the balance of the \n                                                 \n36Ohio Department of Youth Services, 2007 District Plan, 7. \n  115\n\nclass.  Her experiences were not atypical of other incidents related by \nschool staff.   \nThe prevalence of gang behavior is a growing concern that schools \ncannot address alone.  Realistically, a certain number of these incidents \nwill occur in a correctional facility, and will increase with overcrowding.  \nThe new superintendent at Marion referenced the great need for a culture \nchange, and the Indian River superintendent states that they are working \non a culture change in her facility.  It is critical that school and facility \nstaff coordinate and work together to solve this problem with structured \ncommunication and cooperation between the schools and units.   \nEducational Assessment, Guidance Counseling & Reentry Services \nDYS fails to adequately provide a system of academic and career \ntechnical counseling and initial screening.  Guidance counselors and \nteachers report that standardized tests given at the reception center often \nresult in unreliable scores due to a number of factors related to emotional \nand physical adjustment to incarceration. At least one school retests all of \nits students because of the unreliability of the data received from Scioto \nreception, and staff in several schools suggests that it would be more \nreliable to test the students after they have had time to adjust to new \nsurroundings.  \nCounselors do not provide an adequate system of academic, career \ntechnical and postsecondary counseling for students.  If a student \napproaches the guidance office with a request for guidance in any of these \nareas, the counselors will assist the student, but there is no system in place \nto inform students of these services, nor is there a systematic effort to \nencourage students to seek postsecondary education. \nCounselors cite time limitations as reasons for not fully performing \nduties that are additional to scheduling and transcript issuance. In theory, \nscheduling should become easier once the new computerized learning \nsystem is functioning.  However, this theory has yet to be tested.  In the \nmeantime, two DYS schools have devised methods to extend the reach of \n  116\n\nexisting counselors.  At Scioto reception, the TO provides that four \nteachers, rather than guidance counselors, perform assessment duties \nunder the supervision of one guidance counselor.   At Hickory Grove \n(Marion) where the guidance position is vacant, these duties have been \nperformed by a teacher relieved of classroom duties and a permanent \nsubstitute teacher under the supervision of an assistant principal. Adapting \nthese models, under the supervision of a guidance counselor, all DYS \nschools could utilize competent administrative assistants, much like the \nspecial education assistants, to perform technical duties.  This would free \nup guidance counselors to provide intensive counseling on career tech and \npostsecondary issues.    \nThe Bureau’s mission is to provide educational programs and \nservices to help students develop competencies necessary for successful \nreentry into the community.  However, funding for postsecondary options \nhas been removed; a counterproductive action that likely ensures that \nachievers in the facility rise no higher.  Additionally, opportunities that \nwere once available to selected students off-grounds, such as work \nopportunities and even, at one facility after assiduous efforts by an AOT \nteacher, a college visit, are no longer available.  Reentry efforts are \nadditionally hampered by restrictions on intranet access for students who \nare not able to access hometown newspapers to survey job and housing \noptions and are not able to access a wealth of information about \npostsecondary options.  All of these restrictions make successful reentry a \nchallenge for even the most motivated student.   \nThere are creative ways to bridge transition to the community.  The \nIndian River AOT teacher brought postsecondary options into the school \nby bringing in a nearby college class to complete a joint project with \nstudents.  This project culminated in program where every student, dressed \nin a suit and tie, made a presentation to a group of more than 100 people.  \n  117\n\nEach participating DYS student obtained college credit for the work.37  \nThis effort should be replicated, and other facilities should be encouraged \nto develop similar outreach efforts.   \nCareer-Technical and Job Training \nDYS convened a Job Skills Committee in 2007 which identified \nthe strengths and weaknesses of the career tech programs.  The \nrecommendations of that committee do not go far enough to address the \nlack of an effective career tech program in the DYS school system. \nThe vast majority of students do not receive systematic career \ncounseling.  At reception, all youth take the career interest inventory \nwhich helps the youth identify personal vocational interests and skills. The \nresults of this inventory resemble a wish list and do not provide a basis \nupon which to individualize the educational plan for the youth.  For many \nstudents, the inventory will be helpful only if they are also provided \nsystematic academic and career technical counseling to assist in \ndeveloping realistic goals.   \nCareer tech administrators acknowledge that there have been zero \ncompleters of any of the two-year career tech classes “in several years.”  \nThe administrator attributes this to the short terms of commitment for \nDYS youth.  This explanation ignores the substantial number of DYS \nyouth incarcerated for two years or more, none of whom has completed a \ncareer tech program. The stated mission of DYS is to provide educational \nprograms to help youth successfully reenter their home communities.38  \nYouth cannot achieve successful reentry without job skills.   \nDiscussions with Bureau administrators about the career tech \nprograms reveal that some of the problems of the program are related to \nthe apparently inflexible requirements of the Ohio Department of \n                                                 \n37 The college students working on the project wanted to provide gifts to the facility students at the end of \nthe project—the AOT teacher recommended dictionaries which, she noted, students will steal.  \nInterestingly, the assistant principal at Hickory Grove also provides rhyming dictionaries as rewards, noting \nthe students’ intense interest in these.  There is a message here about students’ interest in learning.  \n38 Ohio Department of Youth Services, 2007 District Plan, 2. \n  118\n\nEducation (ODE), through which career tech programs are unit funded.  A \nfrustrated career tech teacher shared this insight:  \n “In the public schools, virtually every DYS youth would be a \nviable candidate for career tech.  Youth with behavior problems that don’t \ndo well anywhere else often do well in career tech classes. Even the \nsmallest school should have career tech classes that are full. However, \ncurrent requirements related to funding units through ODE prevent this \nfrom happening.”  \nYouth are placed in DYS according to security and treatment \nneeds.  While there are several career tech offerings in the system, it is \nonly by happenstance that a youth’s placement will match his actual \ninterest and aptitude.  For example, Indian River offers a strong auto body \nrepair class, but a student with aptitude for auto body repair may be \nassigned to Luther Ball (Cuyahoga) where there is no class.  Students with \naptitude for anything other than office technology have no substantive \noptions if placed at Luther Ball (Cuyahoga) or Willis (Scioto).  \nThe classification system and ODE’s inflexible requirements are \nnot the only challenges to a robust career tech program.  Each school has \nnumerous high school graduates and GED completers that would benefit \nfrom attending career tech classes while also boosting the census of \nendangered classes. However, ODE requires that a graduate or GED \ncompleter take two additional classes when enrolling in career tech.  This \nrequirement virtually eliminates the possibility that a youth in either of \nthese categories will opt for career tech preferring, instead, to sit in a \nholding room or on the unit.   \nAnother substantial road block to successful career tech \nprogramming involves limited space. Space limitations play a significant \nrole in the electives that may be offered. Tecumseh (ORV) and Luther \nBall (Cuyahoga) are bursting at the seams with virtually every square inch \nutilized.  An annex at Tecumseh was planned to house additional career \n  119\n\ntech offerings, but this facility has not materialized.  Luther Ball has \nempty dorms but they have not been converted to school space. \nEducational Programs and Support \nSeveral identified student populations are not receiving instruction \nof high quality designed to meet their needs.  One such group is the \nstudents whose reading scores are so low as to result in their exclusion \nfrom the Striving Readers (Read 180) grant awarded to DYS in March \n2006.  These are “beginning readers” and on October 30, 2007, they \ncomprised approximately 7% of the DYS population.  Guidelines for Read \n180 specifically exclude students whose reading scores label them \n“beginning readers,” thus excluding the students with the most severe \nreading deficits.  Compounding the problem for these unfortunate students \nis the decision at all schools except Indian River to convert Title I reading \npositions to math.  Therefore, students with the most severe need for \nremedial reading are receiving the least amount of direct services—their \nTitle I reading services have been eliminated and they are excluded from \ndirect services in the Read 180 classrooms.39  Although Bureau officials \nbelieve that the mandated P.D. for all teachers under the reading grant will \nimprove reading in the general education classrooms, no evidence of that \nwas seen during observations.  To make matters worse, it is reported that \nthe new computerized learning system will not have instructional software \nto teach pre-literate students to read.  Thus the students with the lowest \nreading scores have no targeted direct programming to assist them in \nlearning to read, and no remedy is in sight. \nThis regulation is also not met for some other groups, including the \nlimited but growing number of 12- and 13-year-old students in the custody \nof DYS.  DYS has no middle school to serve these students.  They are \nsandwiched in to high school classes, sometimes with 20-year-old \nstudents.  These classes simply are not “appropriate to the students’ age \n                                                 \n39 The elimination of the Title I reading teachers also negatively affects those students who are slightly \nbetter than “beginning readers” but who are in the roughly 50% of students randomly selected to not \nparticipate in Read 180. \n  120\n\n(and) developmental needs.”  The older, often toughened students become \nthe role models for these 12- and 13-year olds.   \nPhysical Plant \nLuther Ball at Cuyahoga, Tecumseh at ORV, and Scioto River \n(boys’ reception) have classroom and office space problems.  Luther Ball \nat Cuyahoga Hills and Hickory Grove at Marion additionally have issues \nimpacting safety, and Luther Ball has sanitation concerns.  These \nproblems interrelate with other challenges in the facilities, compounding \ndifficulties for staff and impairing the quality of education provided to \nstudents.   \nLuther Ball at Cuyahoga Hills is overcrowded.  The lack of \nclassroom space limits the number of electives students can be offered, \nnegatively impacting student scheduling, student idleness, and educational \noutcomes for students. Career tech classes are almost non-existent because \nof lack of adequate space.  At Indian River, students are placed in \nclassrooms, “based on wherever there is a seat.”  Hickory Grove at Marion \nuses its IAT to make educational placement decisions for students being \nconsidered for placement in the mental health unit classroom, and it was \nexplained that if there are no seats, “we just don’t start up the IAT process \nuntil there’s an open slot.” \nAlthough reportedly shared space has now been found for the \ncontract Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) at Luther Ball, for months \nshe often had to hunt for a work space upon arrival.  She reports that this \nsearch for an area where she could work with a student could take as much \nas half an hour each day she arrived.  This is contract time that could \notherwise have been productively spent on student services.  While school \nspace is occupied by non-educational staff and services, special education \nclasses are splitting a classroom, an assistant principal shares an office \nwith another staff person, two guidance counselors share a large room \nwith an administrative assistant, and special education teachers are sharing \n  121\n\nwork space with the SLP.  All of these limitations negatively impact the \nquality of youth learning.  \nCeiling tiles are broken or missing in at least one classroom and \nthe ISS room at Luther Ball.  Reportedly students have used the missing \ntiles to attempt to crawl into the ceiling for whatever egress that might \ngive them.  Despite requests extending more than ten weeks to repair these \ntiles, they remain missing or broken.  Additionally, there is a serious \nbathroom issue at the school affecting facility conditions that impact \nstudent learning.   \nA Scioto administrator notes that there is a “lack of space to \neducate both boys and girls for a full school day; a lack of space to work \nwith students 1:1; a lack of space for administrative staff.” The Scioto \nRiver (boys’ reception)) guidance counselor shares a cramped office with \na special education teacher and the school secretary.  There is no space for \nprivate conferences or telephone conversations. Finally, the most crucial \nspace limitation at Scioto River is that the shortage of classrooms limits \nthe students to only three hours of class per day.  \nTecumseh at ORV is also suffering severe space limitations.  \nCommon areas in the school, such as hallways, cannot expand to \naccommodate the additional students that have arrived.  During the site \nvisit, there were 240-260 students moving in the hall at any one time, and \nthere were 36 to 50 students per period who had no class because there are \ninsufficient numbers of classrooms and teachers.  Since the site visit, the \nclassification system has resulted in even more students at Tecumseh, with \nstudents now receiving even fewer classes.  \nDuring the Tecumseh visit at ORV, when the temperature was in \nthe high 80s and low 90s, an air conditioning unit was not functioning in \nthe building housing the Intensive Programming Unit (IPU) and the \nAlternative Learning Center (ALC).  Although fans were operating, they \nwere not reaching the individual cells nor were they serving the ALC. On \nthe next day, this air conditioning unit was still broken and the units \n  122\n\nserving the school building proper were also down.  By mid-afternoon, all \nteachers had their doors open and there was discussion of canceling \nclasses.  Tecumseh school officials report that this experience is not an \nanomaly; there are frequent problems with both the air conditioning and \nheating systems. \nThere are also security and safety issues at some schools.  Within \nthe last few months, gang-related assaults on students have been reported \nat Tecumseh (ORV) and Hickory Grove (Marion).  Since January 2007, \nstudent assaults on staff members have been reported at Hickory Grove \nand Indian River and there may be additional incidents at these and other \nDYS schools. Deficiencies exist in the security systems.  There is a need \nfor security cameras. The man-down system at Hickory Grove at Marion \nrequires parts ordered from overseas.  Thus, when it was hit by lightening \nduring the site visit, it could not be immediately repaired and teachers had \nno classroom security.  \nThe fire alarm cannot be heard in two classrooms at Luther Ball at \nCuyahoga, and the “man down” hardwired buttons on the walls do not \nfunction in any of the classrooms.  Staff members have radios, and the \nprincipal explained that on occasions when they are short on radios, she \nand/or the Program Deputy relinquish theirs.  At the time of the site visit, a \nwork order had been in place for an extended period of time to fix the \ndoors to the gym.  That had not happened, and students were popping the \ndoors open, contributing to already existing problems in gym class.40   \nSupplements \nSupplements about the school programs at Marion, the Freedom \nCenter and Willis (the program for girls at Scioto) are attached to the full \neducation report.  The Willis program is substantially improved from \n2004.  There are significant problems with the Freedom Center education \nservices.  The school program at Marion also has serious problems, and \n                                                 \n40 This class is substantially over cap because there are no other electives available.  The class is already the \nsource of many, many behavioral issues without the complication of additional youth coming in and out. \n  123\n\nmany of the CRIPA issues identified by Dr. John Wills Lloyd’s September \n26, 2005 report continue to be areas of great concern.   \nTo supplement Dr. Lloyd’s findings:  \n•  Child Find efforts appear to be improved, but it is recommended that the \nBureau of Education continue to monitor this area.   \n•  Issues remain with IEP team membership and the collaborative drafting of \nIEPs.   \n•  Significant issues remain with changes of educational placement to an \nalternative learning center and to unit instruction; with individualization of \nstudent services on IEPs and the monitoring of progress on IEP goals; with \nthe effective use of positive behavior interventions; with the use of \nfunctional behavioral assessments and behavior intervention plans; and \nwith the quality of instruction and classroom management.   \n•  Dr. Lloyd expressed concerns about limited professional development \nbeing made available in many of these areas.  The Bureau and school have \nmade professional development available, but this has not ameliorated \nmany of the concerns it was apparently designed to address. \nConclusion \nIn sum, it will be a daunting task for the DYS school system to \nbring itself into minimal compliance with federal and state law.  It will \ntake organizational commitment, increased resources and focused energy.  \nAnything less will merely maintain the deficient status quo. \n[End Crow Report] \n \n \n  124\n\nADDENDUM 41\nSection VI, Education \n \n \nImproving Education Opportunities \n \n \n•  ODYS secured a 5 year $14 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education.  \nThis grant allows us to provide intensive literacy intervention to a subset of our \npopulation who are deficient at least two grade levels.  This grant has also \nprovided DYS the opportunity to train our education professionals to infuse \nliteracy into every subject.  The program is an intensive daily 90-minute class, in \nwhich a group of 12-15 students rotate in to different stations for short blocks of \ntime.  The stations include video software, student / teacher one-on-ones, audio \nbooks and paperbacks to ensure that students, regardless of learning method, are \nable to benefit.    \n \nODYS will collaborate with the Ohio Department of Education to provide a \ntraining curriculum for DYS instructors.  The Ohio State University’s Center for \nLearning Excellence will develop the research evaluation component of the \nproject.  Since DYS was the only correctional system in the nation to apply for \nthis grant, the results of this study could be the benchmark for literacy programs \nin juvenile justice systems nationwide.   \n \n•  All teaching positions in the ODYS school district requiring a Highly Qualified \nStatus are filled with teachers who are Highly Qualified in the subject matter \nunder the No Child Left Behind Act. \n \n•  In 2008 the ODYS school district will move to provide individualized learning \nenvironments for all youth via the student learning system.  This web-based \nprogram will allow each student to be assessed in all core academic areas and will \nthen design an individualized learning curriculum for each student.  This will \nallow each student to work at his or her individual ability level and allow the \ndistrict to accurately assess student progress. The program also provides the \npotential for accelerated credit recovery, improving a youth’s chances at \nachieving a diploma. \n                                                 \n41 Submitted by ODYS to Fred Cohen on December 21, 2007.  Fred Cohen excised some of this submission \nand slightly edited other parts. \n  125\n\nVII.  OVERCROWDING & STAFFING: TRAINING AND PROGRAMMING \n \nOvercrowding \nThe general population juvenile correctional facilities (JCF) (IRVCF, MaJCF, \nORVJCF, and SJCF) are overcrowded.  These facilities operated at 141% of rated \ncapacity on the dates of our assessments.  Only the treatment-oriented facilities (Mohican \nand Circleville) operated below rated capacity (see Roush Report, Table 2). \nResearch and experience indicate that there are no benefits and many liabilities to \nyouth or staff in crowded institutions.  Indicators of safety and programming suffer \nduring periods of crowding, and this level of crowding is sufficient to have a clear and \nnegative effect on those indictors.  Levels of crowding co-vary with the Performance-\nbased Standards (PbS) measures of safety and program effectiveness (see Roush Report, \nTable 3). \nExpert David Roush asserts that overcrowding creates social density problems \nassociated with adverse effects that are particularly aggravated with children and youth. \nWhen crowding or density increases, studies have found: \n•  Decreases in the ability to classify and treat; incarceration becomes \nwarehousing. \n•  Effects apply to not only residents but also staff. \n•  Increases in the frequency and rate of disruptive behaviors; effects are \naggravated with juvenile and young adult offenders. \n•  Decreases in residents’ perceptions of order, organization, and staff \nsupport. \n•  Decreases in involvement with peers; decreases in classroom cooperation, \nand lower school grades. \n•  Decreases in perceptions of safety. \n•  Increases in aggressive behaviors in boys; girls were unaffected. \n•  Increases in the rates of social withdrawal, of avoidance of eye contact, \nand of solitary play. \n•  Increases in the rates of juvenile-on-staff injuries. \n•  Increases in the rate of suicidal behaviors. \n  126\n\n•  Increases in the rate of isolation (room confinement) less than 24 hours in \nduration. \n•  Increases in the rate of injury. \nOvercrowding negatively affects privacy. For example, youth we spoke with \nrequested more supervision for the bathroom area. Because of double occupancy or a \ndoubling of the capacity, it takes longer to shower in the living unit, so several JCFs \nmodified the bathrooms to make more room for group showers which, in turn, impinge \non privacy. Additionally, there are no surveillance cameras in the bathrooms, and \nresidents state that the absence of cameras makes the bathroom dangerous. \nThe need for time-phasing or sharing of recreational space means that it is not \nuncommon for groups or living units to participate in the large muscle exercise period \nimmediately following a meal. At two JCFs, the large muscle exercise (recreation) \noccurred at 7:50 a.m. \nThe IJA-ABA, Juvenile Justice Standards: Corrections administration, Sec. 7.2 \n(1996), drafted in the early 1970’s, adopted the “smaller is better” philosophy and \npromulgated a limitation on the size of residential facilities in the range of 12 to 20 \noccupants.  Table 2 of the Roush Report describes rated and actual capacity for the \nfacilities visited. \nThe Boone Unit at Scioto was found to be 262% over capacity, Building 6, Unit \nD at Marion was at 192% of capacity, and Aviation-Rickenbacker at ORV was at 205% \nof capacity.  Circleville had only one unit slightly above capacity because the facility \nitself went from a two-person to a one-person celling arrangement in light of recent \nlitigation. \nWhen facilities are overcrowded and staff size is not adjusted accordingly, the \npotential for exacerbating the negative consequences listed above increases dramatically.  \nAt a certain point the crowding-harm to youth calculus is such that DYS violates its \nconstitutional obligation to provide youth with a safe environment. \nStaffing \nWhether this Report speaks to education, mental health, or security, there is a \ncommon thread to our findings: Staffing is inadequate.  The normative term \n“inadequate,” in turn, takes on meaning only in the context of the objectives to be \n  127\n\nachieved.  In this section, I will speak primarily of security and safety.  Term member \nDavid Roush, in his report, states bluntly, “DYS is severely understaffed at the JCO job \nclassification.  Current staffing is below a basic level to ensure safety, order, and \nprograms.” \nThis finding, of course, relates understaffing to violence: youth-on-youth and \nstaff-on-youth.  The ripple effect of the JCO shortage reaches powerfully into what \nappears to be the primary job irritant for the JCOs: the dreaded mandation. \nI personally interviewed JCO, union representatives in each of the six facilities I \nvisited (25 people).  Their chief complaint was being required to work mandatory \novertime.  Marion JCOs represent that the average workweek for them includes 24 hours \nor more of overtime per week. \nI interviewed one JCO who took pride in working 80 hours for as long as he could \nremember.  He put two daughters through medical school by following this work \nschedule.  He did not complain about mandation nor did he distinguish to me mandated \novertime from voluntary overtime. \nIn Section V, discussing mental health issues, we noted that the JCOs function \nprimarily as custodial staff when they might be much more effective as a part of a \ntreatment-rehabilitation system and team.  Their job descriptions would appear to support \nthe role of JCOs in facilitating group discussion and assisting youth in the development \nof goals and acceptable social behavior. \nThe team found no evidence that JCOs accept or perform this more expansive \nrole, certainly not in any systematic fashion.  However, even if the expanded role were to \nbe embraced it simply could not be performed with the current numbers of JCOs and \ntheir educational background and training. \nWe were unable to acquire precise data on the incidence of mandated overtime.  \nHowever, we have sufficient confidence in the data and anecdotal material we do have to \ndescribe mandation as a serious systemic problem in need of early resolution. \nAdditional JCO staffing, if done properly should enhance safety and security in \nthe facilities and also solve the most nagging problem as universally expressed by JCOs: \nmandated overtime. \n  128\n\nIn analyzing JCO staff shortfalls, the investigative team strongly believes that it \nwould be a fundamental error to begin hiring JCOs without first reviewing and \ndetermining what role, if any, there should be for JCOs beyond security and safety.  An \nexpanded role for JCOs, in turn, would make sense in the context of a review and \npossible reconstitution of the architecture and objectives of the agency itself. \nWorking within the framework of a safety and security mission, team member \nDavid Roush asked: What is an appropriate staffing ratio?  What follows is his approach \nto answering that question.  This is a difficult question because of multiple perspectives. \nRoush referenced an Ohio ratio of 1:12, which may not be directly applicable here, as one \nof his basis for estimating JCO needs. There is a real ratio based on current practices \n(1:24). There is a ratio based on practitioner experience (1:10). There is a best practices \nratio derived from a review and summary of research and professional writings on the \ntopic of staff sufficiency (1:8). \nBased on evidence acquired to date, the current DYS staffing patterns have been \nable to accomplish only one of its affirmative duties, security. Perceptions of safety are \nsubstantially low among residents and staff. Both express substantial levels of fear for \ntheir personal safety (see Roush Report, Table 3).  Over 60% of the teachers in the DYS \neducation system report that they fear for their safety. \nThe fiscally responsible staffing goal should be a DYS operation that is adequate \nin numbers and possesses the skills necessary to do the job.  “Adequate” means that the \nstaffing ratio (number youth per JCO staff) should be at the point where safety, security, \norder, and programs operate effectively. The skill development function brings with it the \nexpectation that staff perform their job duties competently within a viable system that \nprovides quality leadership and supervision.) \nThe perspective on “adequate” staffing differs between the adult corrections and \nthe juvenile justice viewpoints. At the core are the differences with adolescent \ndevelopment. From the adolescent perspectives (safety, security, order, and programs), an \nadult corrections expert’s tour of the JCFs may prompt only a mild concern or comment \nabout inadequate staffing.  However, from the juvenile justice expert’s perspective, the \nsame tour literally takes one’s breath away. Explaining the severity of the understaffing \n  129\n\nto those with an adult corrections model prompts the use of exaggerated analogies and \nmetaphors. \nThe current staffing levels (Tables of Organization or Matrix staffing numbers) \nlikely derive from staffing estimates calculated on a ratio (1:12) when institutional \ncapacities were substantially less. Therefore, the alternative way of addressing the \nstaffing ratio without adding staff is to reduce the population of DYS institutions and \nmaintain the present “law and order” model. \nJCO staffing levels now are so low that they likely covary with other indicators, \nespecially those that measure safety and bureaucratic dysfunction. This is the case when \ncomparing the staff shortage numbers per JCF with corresponding PbS measures of \nsafety and program outcomes. From a methodological perspective, caution is warranted \nsince support for bureaucratic dysfunction might simply be another measure of \ninadequate staffing. \nIf the 1:12 ratio is used as the definition of “lean” staffing, will require 188 new \nFTE JCO positions (not including those Matrix positions that are currently vacant) and an \nincrease in the personnel budget of $ 7.8 million annually based on a starting salary of \n$15 per hour. (For the 1:10 ratio, the annual increase is $ 10.6 million and, for the 1:8 \nratio, the annual increase is $ 14.2 million.) This remedy is expensive. Hence, a workable \nalternative could be a plan that incrementally expands JCO staffing and responsibilities \nwhile reducing institutional populations and increasing reliance on community resources. \nThis Report offers no firm recommendation on JCO staffing other than to assert \nthat current staffing under current conditions is too low.  Settlement discussions might \nfocus on 90 new positions as a low and 188 as a high with a final number subject to \nnegotiation and the possibility of an objective post-settlement study. \nWithout addressing this issue, the JCOs will continue to struggle with the fallout \nof mandation while security and safety will remain problematic. \nTraining \nTraining differs from education in that training is focused on skills and task/job \nperformance. While there clearly may be some overlap, educational enterprises seek to \nconvey ways of thinking; acquisition of data; and broad, general concepts.  Education is \nto architecture what training is to carpentry. \n  130\n\nTeam member David Roush found no evidence of educational programs at the \nTraining Academy (TA) and had serious questions about the training program for DYS \nstaff. \nThe TA itself has excellent physical space, adequate training staff, and some \nacceptable training materials.  Evaluations of trainees, however, are too subjective.  Due \nto the shortages of JCOs, trainers work individually and prompt trainees on how to \nanswer post-test questions correctly, thereby increasing the numbers that pass the training \nand move to the JCFs for work assignments. \nOnce a fledgling JCO completes the TA training and moves on to a JCF there will \nbe only one training officer who, in turn, must use fellow JCOs and other staff as trainers.  \nWith 30 of the 40 hours of annual mandatory training prescribed by DYS, this leaves \nlitter time for facility-specific issue training. \nA theme that emerged from the interviews with training officers was the concept \nof “temporary proficiency.” Two training officers used the term when discussing physical \nrestraint training. Their belief was that most JCOs do not remember the Response-to-\nResistance (R2R) protocols and techniques. Without an ongoing annual refresher course, \nthere contention was that staff have only a temporary proficiency in the approved \nrestraint strategy following the Pre-Service Academy.  This, of course, was independently \ndescribed by team member Steve Martin. \nOn-the-job-training (OJT) is the main influence on JCO behavior according to \nJCOs and training officers. It is correctional, custodial, and security-oriented; and it \nreinforces the harsh staff climate in each JCF. \nThe OJT is an 80-hour process that reinforces most of the poor practices in the job \nperformance of JCOs. None of the training officers reported regular meetings with the \nmentor JCOs to discuss, review, or evaluate the OJT process. Furthermore, training \nofficers indicated that they do not get training or guidance from DYS regarding OJT. No \none mentioned a recent meeting of training officers to discuss or evaluate OJT. \nThe system avoids information and concepts from the childcare and adolescent \nperspectives. The heavy emphasis on the correctional aspects (security, staff safety, and \ncontrol) seems to preclude information about adolescence and the legal rights of juveniles \nthat could be helpful in altering behavior. This preoccupation creates a condition where \n  131\n\nthe absence of a broad-based training experience and the lack of openness to the \nuniqueness of adolescence, combine to enforce the culture of violence we have observed. \nAs if moving lockstep with adult corrections, JCOs receive training and \ninformation on STG (security threat groups) without clear differentiations with mental \nhealth behaviors. To use Maslow’s hackneyed adage, “When a hammer is the only tool in \nyour toolbox, soon all of your problems begin to look like nails,” it seems as if security is \nthe only tool in the JCO toolbox and all misbehaviors look like a security threat. \nThe training philosophy we observed contributes to the adultification of Ohio’s \njuvenile corrections system. \nBased on the training and job shadowing provided to the new JCO, he or she \nlikely goes into a situation assuming that the youth want to fight. Youth see a JCO’s \nhostile, menacing appearance (stern looks, tough and confident demeanor) and respond in \nkind with a hostile display (or bravado for peers). New staff conclude that their original \nexpectation was correct: The youth do want to fight. It never dawns on anyone that \nperhaps staff that look for trouble, create or sustain the hostility. \nWhatever its origins, the adult corrections metaphor is a bad choice for use with \njuveniles but an even poorer choice when used alone or without a treatment strategy. Not \ninsisting on a duty to perform rehabilitative functions from the JCO allows, even \nencourages, JCOs to entertain a very limited set of solutions to solve any problem and a \nvery limited set of ways to organize themselves. JCOs solve problems by sanctioning \ninappropriate behaviors (tickets, behavioral incident and discipline reports), tightening \ncontrols, introducing more discipline and structure, sending for reinforcements (signals or \ncodes), or clarifying responsibilities, i.e., holding youth accountable by focusing greater \ntime and attention on the relationship between misbehaviors and sanctions. \nApplication of an adult corrections philosophy to juvenile corrections usually \nmeans (a) a diminishing of the roles and responsibilities of line staff (JCOs), i.e., they \nwould no longer be viewed by youth or the system as adjuncts or partners in the behavior \nchange or rehabilitation process, and (b) an increasing emphasis on safety, security, and \ncontrol in the job description. These safety, security, and control functions are viewed by \nadministration as much less complex, requiring fewer skills on the part of JCOs and, \ntherefore, based on extrapolations from the adult corrections experience, capable of being \n  132\n\naccomplished with fewer numbers of staff with lower pre-employment qualifications and \npay grades. \nThe architecture of Ohio’s juvenile corrections has taken on prison-like qualities, \ni.e., harder construction, increased and enhanced security technology, and the ability to \nlockdown quickly various areas of the institution from a central surveillance location. \nThe exemplar of this architecture is, for example, the Marion Juvenile Corrections \nFacility. \nStaff are trained to find problems and to sanction them, i.e., hold youth \naccountable. PbS data suggest this confrontational approach disproportionally affects \noutcomes negatively. Staff functioning with this approach appear to far outnumber the \npositive ones mentioned earlier, and they have the dominant influence in most of the \ngeneral population JCFs. \nMany of the staff interviewed expressed a sense of moral outrage about the youth \nin their care, of a need to enforce accountability for the derelictions of the youth in their \ncharge.  Certainly nothing in the training was designed to even challenge these beliefs; \nbeliefs that when translated into action creates a battlefield mentality. \nStaff repeatedly raised the same question, “What about the victim?” References \nwere made to the sexual abuse of children, and then someone would ask the hypothetical \nquestion about how you or anyone would feel if one of these youth had raped your child. \nIn each interaction, staff cynically juxtaposed heinous behaviors with “official” DYS \nconsequences of playing video games, watching TV, or having pizza parties. These JCOs \nare angry that an adequate or sufficient punishment had not yet been inflicted upon these \nyouth. They expressed a sense of moral outrage that DYS would allow youth to continue \nto get away with disgusting behaviors. \nArmed with the righteousness of moral outrage these staff members are quick to \nmove to a physical restraint or excessive force, and often are strategic in the location to \navoid cameras or to shield cameras from the view of the force.  Their behavior, then, is \nnot viewed as improper; it is the hand of the righteous combating evil. \nOne ORV resident interview group (six youth) was unanimous in its allegations \nthat it had witnessed staff assaulting youth. Several youth in the group described different \nways that staff would physically abuse them. They indicated that staff would initiate a \n  133\n\nrestraint and then call for an administrator. The abuse occurs between the time of the call \nand the arrival of the administrator. Youth claim that JCOs tell the administrator that the \nyouth acted out or attacked them, so they were forced to initiate an immediate restraint. \nThe youth then claim that the official response from administration is that they arrived on \nthe unit after the restraint was initiated. \nIn response to the question about how staff get away with excessive force in areas \nwith cameras, the group described a process where JCOs would stand between the \noffending staff member and the camera while excessive force was applied. They \nindicated that an example of this strategy occurred the evening before at about 8:00 p.m. \non their unit. \nFollowing the interview, interviewer David Roush asked to see the digital \nrecording from that particular unit. It seemed a simple request since on the previous day \nhe had watched as one management person located and showed the digital recording of \nmy tour of the same living unit. For this request, a series of technical problems and \nomissions prevented anyone at the facility from being able to retrieve the video. Staff did \nfind the incident report and one administrator indicated that he had direct knowledge of \nthe restraint. He qualified his comments by stating, “The restraint had already occurred \nby the time I reached the unit.” \nExpert Roush made several other, equally unsuccessful attempts to see the camera \nrecording of this event.  DYS has not refuted the claims of these youth despite the \nexistence of a camera system designed for that very purpose. \nStaff training overemphasizes the prevention of problems.  “No problems,” “no \ntickets” become the primary indicators of a youth’s success as opposed to exhibiting \nprogress, appropriate behavior, and learning.  As mental hospitals found “success” in the \nsilence of their residents brought about by the newly discovered psychotropic \nmedications; as prisons take pride in no escapes, no suicides, and no “tickets” for \ninmates, JCFs follow in their wake. \nTraining appears to strengthen the JCOs’ ability to spot misbehaviors and to \ndetermine the appropriate amount of sanction, consequence or force required to induce \ncompliance. A competent youth behavior management training program would teach \nstaff members (1) how to weaken or eliminate misbehaviors and (2) how to expand and \n  134\n\nstrengthen appropriate behaviors.  The DYS adult corrections bias focuses on only one-\nhalf of the process and thereby contributes to the overall malaise.  \nAs one example of a standardized omission of the positive aspects of youth work, \nthe “On-The-Job Training Manual” provided us for our assessment contains 52 pages of \nperformance objectives and steps (activities) that constitute a checklist of training \nactivities for new JCOs. All of these activities must be demonstrated to the new JCO, and \nthe designated staff member then ensures that the new JCO performs each activity. \nNowhere in the 52 pages is there anything that addresses the importance of \nreinforcement, encouragement, or praise. Nowhere is there a step or activity that teaches \na skill of recognizing what youth do appropriately. \nTraining staff understand this problem, and most indicated that they or their \ntrainers do try to talk about the importance of a positive approach. At IRJCF, the trainer \nprovided a PowerPoint presentation about reinforcement of positive youth behavior. \nThere were no indications that the materials are part of the training curriculum, or a \nlesson plan, nor a record of its use. \nStaff training currently lacks clarity on the fundamental distinctions between legal \nrights and duties.  For every right possessed by youth, there is an affirmative duty placed \non staff.  Where law is mentioned or taught it is by non-lawyers and too often as a device \nto avoid liability. \nEach area of juvenile law on point has its own substance: use of force, isolation, \nmental health, and so on.  Staff, of course, must know when and how to use force.  They \nalso should know why the law is different for youth; the long history of legal distinctions \nbased on youth; the law’s implicit and explicit adoption of reduced culpability and \nsalvagability based on youth; the law’s commitment to reformation. \nTo that end, we would urge the creation of introductory and advanced courses on \njuvenile law and custodial obligations with regard to youth.  This writer would be pleased \nto prepare such materials, pilot them, and “train the trainers” for the future. \nTraining Remedies \nWhat follows is a series of suggestions for consideration of the parties in revising \nand improving existing DYS training programs: \n  135\n\n•  All training topics should have a lesson plan that exists separate from \nPowerPoint slides and contains training objectives, useful participant \nhandouts, and an evaluation experience that identifies participants who \nhave not acquired basic skill levels because of the training. \n•  More trainers are needed. There should be a full-time trainer for every 50 \nFTE staff members. \n•  DYS should upgrade and expand its training materials, particularly \naudiovisual resources that are juvenile specific. The Training Department \nshould consider establishing a relationship with the juvenile justice \ntraining staff at the University of Illinois at Springfield. \n•  DYS should improve the content and quality of staff training by \nembracing a balanced approach to juvenile corrections, specifically a \nstrengthening of the JCOs skill development from a strength-based or \npositive perspective. The current training program is out-of-balance and \noveremphasizes discipline and control. Safety and security are \nstrengthened, not compromised, by a strengths-based component. \n•  Changes in the philosophy of JCO training must be reflected in the \nrecruitment and selection of new staff. It is far easier and more effective to \nteach someone who likes youth how to do safety and security than it is to \nteach someone who does safety and security well how to like youth. \n•  DYS needs to change its training strategy and materials away from a adult \ncorrections philosophy to a juvenile corrections or juvenile careworker \nmodel. \n•  DYS should collect feedback and information from each JCF regarding \nlocal training needs for JCO staff. \n•  DYS should conduct focus groups to evaluate and improve OJT. \n•  DYS should infuse a positive and strengths-based perspective into line \nstaff training materials whenever possible. \n•  Courses in juvenile law and recognizing and dealing with mental illness \nshould be developed and initially taught by recognized experts in the field who would \nthen “train the trainers.” \n  136\n\nVIII.  HEALTH AND DENTAL SERVICES \n \nHealth Services Overview \nThe physical health care needs of incarcerated youth rest on the same principles \nof cognitive, developmental and associated disabilities as the provision of mental health \ncare.  There is no question that incarcerated youth have a legal right to appropriate \nphysical as well as mental health care.42\nAs Michael D. Cohen, M.D. et al point out: \nAlthough there is a pervasive impression that adolescents are “basically \nhealthy,” this is not always the case.  There are many chronic conditions \nthat are present from childhood, and many of the chronic diseases of \nadults, such as hypertension, Type-2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease, \nhave their onset in adolescence.  Although youth may not yet be \nsymptomatic or disabled, they still need care to prevent long-term \ncomplications of these conditions.  Asthma is the most common chronic \nmedical conditions, but there are a multitude of childhood chronic \nillnesses with a prevalence of 1 per 1,000 or less, which are found in youth \nserved by juvenile justice programs.  Recurrent or persistent symptoms in \nan apparently healthy youth may be the initial presentation of a serious \nchronic illness. \nSeveral studies have examined the prevalence of chronic conditions in \nadolescents and delinquents.  An analysis of the 1984 National Health \nInterview Survey showed a prevalence of 6.2% for all types of disability.  \nThe four most common disabling conditions were mental disorders; \nrespiratory conditions, principally asthma; nervous system disorders, \n                                                 \n42 There is no clear line of cases distinguishing the right to correctional health care for juveniles from the \nsame right for adult inmates.  William J. Rold, The Legal Context of Correctional Health Care for Juveniles \nin NCCHC, Standards for Health Services in Juvenile Detention and Confinement Facilities 14-5 (2004), \ncorrectly posits the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as the juvenile’s constitutional basis \nfor the right, but his discussion of the right itself simply parallels the adult’s Eighth Amendment rights as \ninitiated by Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976).  This would mean a medical need must be “serious” and \nthe poor medical care must be traced to a provider’s or custodian’s “deliberate indifference.” \n  137\n\nprincipally seizures; and disorders of the ear and mastoid, principally \nhearing impairments.43\nThe modifier “appropriate” refers to the special medical considerations dictated \nby youth.  Issues of delayed puberty and short stature, nutritionally adequate diets, health \npromotion, and disease avoidance may not be entirely unique to the juvenile population \nbut they are of transcendent importance. \nA medical record either is or is not fit for its intended purpose and has no special \nrequirements for youth.  Continuity of care concerns are crucial for adults and juveniles. \nInjuries, in turn, are quite common in juvenile facilities whether caused by \nyouthful exuberance, staff or youth assaults or athletic activities.  In turn, there must be \nclear guidelines for clinical assessment and physician referral. \nJuveniles in custody have at least the same constitutional right to medical care as \ntheir adult counterparts serving time in prison.44  This means that only serious medical \nconditions mandate care and that care is evaluated by the standard of deliberate \nindifference; a standard less demanding on providers and system functionaries than \nmalpractice.  In my view, the fact that juveniles in the custody of DYS have not been \nconvicted of a crime, that the source of the right is the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due \nProcess Clause, and that the consequences of medical failures for youth can be more \nserious and certainly more long-lasting than for adults argues for a wider net of legal \nresponsibility.45\nI used a similar approach in discussing a juvenile’s right to correctional mental \nhealth care.  That is, one can use the Due Process foundation for juveniles’ rights as a \nspringboard to broadening the medical conditions requiring care or one can accept the \nmore narrow Eighth Amendment-Estelle v. Gamble base but argue that “serious” and \n“deliberate indifference” have a different, more expansive, meaning in the world of \njuvenile corrections. \n                                                 \n43 Michael D. Cohen, Larry Burd, & Mary Beyer, Health Services for Youth in Juvenile Justice Programs \nin Clinical Practice in Correctional Medicine 120, 135 (Michael Puisis, ed., 2d ed 2006). \n44 See note 41, supra. \n45 See American Public Health Association, Standards for Health Services in Correctional Institutions, \nStandard VII.B (2003). \n \n  138\n\nJuveniles, of course, are not placed in official custody for medical care; the right \nto medical care arises from conditions detected when custody is assumed.  With mental \nhealth care, one might argue that juveniles are placed in official custody, if not \nexclusively, then importantly, for rehabilitation and that mental health treatment is a \nsignificant subset of rehabilitation.  Thus, the expansive legal argument for mental health \ncare may be somewhat easier to sustain than the one made here for medical care. \nAs this Section unfolds it will become apparent that the DYS system is riddled \nwith serious deficiencies.  For example, the medical assessments performed at Scioto JCF \nare not monitored for quality or accuracy and do not “connect” the youth to the receiving \nfacility.  Medication administration does not meet current nursing standards, laboratory \nservices have been subject to serious delays and inaccuracies, medical records are \nincomplete, preventive care is dubious, and chronic care clinics simply do not exist. \nThe Medical Director clinically manages the Central Medical Unit at Scioto, \nspending between 600-800 hours annually on site.  This hardly leaves time for peer \nreview, quality assurance, policy development or any other activities associated with \nmedical leadership and administration. \nAs will be developed, this is a system in search of system and in need of \nfundamental change in order to provide legally obligated medical care. \nCurrent Structure of Medical Services \nDYS has one civil servant physician who serves as the Department’s Medical \nDirector.  This position is considered a Bureau Chief and reports to the Deputy Director \nfor Treatment and Rehabilitation Services.  All other physicians are employed by contract \nfor a maximum number of hours per fiscal year.  Dental services are also provided by \ncontract and are addressed under Dental Services in Section VII in the main report.   \nConsultation (technical supervision) for complex cases is provided by the \nDepartment’s Medical Director and direct supervision is provided by the Program Deputy \nat each facility.  The Medical Director currently conducts no peer review.  This should be \na requirement of the position to insure that medical practice standards are being met.  \nPolicies that govern the practice of medicine in DYS facilities should be promulgated \nthrough this office and the Medical Director should have recognized authority in this \narea. \n  139\n\nThere is a Director of Nursing at the Bureau Chief level and all Health Care \nAdministrators report to this individual as well as to the local Program Deputy.  The \ncollaborative relationship between the Medical Director and the Director of Nursing is \nnot currently defined and ultimately must be.  For example, nurses are responsible for \ncompleting initial health appraisals and physicians should have a role in designing those \nappraisals so that critical areas of adolescent development and health history are \nadequately addressed along with family history and personal history of medical and \nmental health. \nThe Medical Director and Director of Nursing should drive policy/procedure \ndevelopment for all medical matters and submit that material for Departmental approval \nthrough the Deputy Director for Treatment and Rehabilitation Services.  Each should, as \nappropriate, participate with the Program Deputy in the assessment and evaluation of \nphysicians and healthcare administrators at the facility level based on clinical practice \nrequirements and current position description specifications. \nMedical Assessments \nInitial assessments are completed at Scioto Juvenile Correction Facility and the \ninformation contained in these documents sets the parameters for care and treatment of \nyouth during his/her stay at ODYS.  Timeliness of the completion of all initial \nassessments (medical, mental health, education etc.) is monitored at Scioto and reported \nto institution administration and central office managers.   \nTimelines currently are being met for the majority of cases.  There are no \npenalties, except incidentally for the youth, if the work is not completed in a timely \nmanner.  Those penalties include delays in enrollment in the educational program and the \nprovision of medical and mental health treatment.    \nThe quality and accuracy of these initial appraisals is not being monitored.  This \nquality improvement process must be added to the Scioto protocols and rigorously \npursued.  The history provided by families is not correlated with the initial or subsequent \nmedical and mental health assessments completed at parent institutions.  Also absent \nfrom the initial appraisal are assessments of physical and sexual development based on \nage and the youth’s current nutritional status.  Hearing and visual tests are to be \n  140\n\ncompleted as parts of the initial physical examination process but often were absent from \nthe medical file. \nAs part of the transfer process, physicians’ review the initial and transfer \ndocuments, if available, and document the review in the progress notes section of the \nindividual youth’s file.  These notes give no indications of the physician’s conclusions \nbased on the information available.  No health status is included; for example, healthy \nmale, immunizations complete, no significant youth or family history of chronic disease \nor mental health issues noted.  When a medical problem has been identified there is no \nphysician note indicating the status of the problem or response to treatment, or even a \ntimeframe for actually examining the youth.    \nYouth are not present during these initial physician record reviews.  When the \nyouth is seen there is no correlation of information documented to confirm the \nphysician’s impressions from the record review.  The lack of documented information \nresults in delays in needed, and at times, vital treatment or the recognition of chronic \ndisease.  In some cases, acute conditions also were missed, or treated but not \ndocumented.  The only penalty we could detect is suffered by youth who have not \nreceived adequate medical care.   \nThe failure to document the use of available information and connect that to the \nyouth’s current health status must be immediately corrected.  The policies on Health Care \nAppraisal and Examination (403.11) and Special Needs Health program (403.15 III and \nIV) should be revised as well as the Transfer Health Appraisal (403.12).  The failure to \ndocument clinical impressions and integrate information that is available results in the \nprovision of inadequate or incomplete care that may then require a higher level of care, \ne.g. emergency room care or hospitalization at a later date accompanied, of course, by \nneedless pain and suffering.   \nRecommended Improvements  \n1.  Initial health care appraisals should be completed by RNs’ and there should be an \narea for the physician’s signature and comments.  These appraisals must include \nan assessment of the adolescent’s physical and sexual development, nutritional \nstatus as well as the areas of mental health etc. \n  141\n\n2.  The transfer health appraisal must be completed by the sending facility and \naccompany all youth at the time of transfer.  These must include: a summary of \nfindings, a summary of care and treatment provided with the youth’s response, a \nlist of current medications and compliance and a list of specialty appointments \ncompleted or pending.              \n3.  The receiving facility, RN and physician should document a review of the \nmaterials received and correlate that information with the youth’s health status on \narrival and at the time of the initial examination by the physician. \n4.  Chronic care clinics should be established for youth with chronic diseases.  \nMonitoring of the youth’s status should be consistent with nationally established  \nguidelines for adolescent care.  These same standards should be used to develop                  \ninstitutional procedures driven by ODYS policy.  There is currently no chronic \ncare program!  Youth with chronic diseases are not seen regularly for status \nchecks and the assessment of the efficacy of the current treatment regime.  This \nbasic lack of care leads to episodic treatment at higher levels than might have \nbeen required.  The lack of chronic care clinics for those who require them \nillustrates systemic failure to engage youth in their own effective disease \nmanagement and care. \n5.  Policy and procedure must require an active system of care with youth seen at \nthe first available physician visit following an acute episode of illness, a specialty \nappointment, hospitalization, etc. \nThere must be better integration of all available medical information.  The \ndiagnostic conclusions and consequent care based upon this information must be clearly \nand specifically documented and maintained in the medical record.  Failure to correlate \nand validate information as received and used by qualified clinicians leaves the youth at \nmedical risk and DYS at risk for failure to treat, or properly treat, when the information \nis, and has been, available but not been used.   \nDetermining that an acute or chronic disease is not present should also be \nconsistently documented. \nMedical information and its use while at the reception center sets the course of \ncare for youth during his/her entire DYS stay.  Qualitative reviews of the material \n  142\n\ncollected and used should be routinely monitored.  Corrective action, including policy \nand procedure review, education and training, should be taken in cases where \nassessments are incomplete; accurate information is not relayed in a timely manner or \nfollow up is not documented. \nInfirmary Care \nDYS has a central medical unit (CMU) at SJCF that is clinically managed by the \nDYS Medical Director requiring 600-800 hours of his time on site annually.  This unit is \nused primarily for convalescent care and appears to have an adequate number of beds \n(10).  Each facility uses a local hospital for emergency care, local specialists may be used \nfor chronic and acute disease and/or providers utilized prior to incarceration may \ncontinue to provide care as required.  \nA review of four infirmary cases, all involving recent surgery, revealed gaps in \nthe medical records.  In one case, the record from the parent institution had not been sent \nand was never available during the youth’s stay even though he was not to return to the \nsame institution.  Medical staff were providing care having no idea of the youth’s history \nor needs beyond the immediate post-operative state.   \nThree of the youth had abnormal blood pressure readings that were never reported \nto the physician, noted by the physician or assessed over time.  A youth with asthma used \nhis inhaler three times in one week; these were not reported to the physician nor were \npeak flow values recorded by the nurse.  Team members brought each of these cases to \nthe attention of the Medical Director.  \nThe amount of time the Medical Director spends on the provision of direct care \nmust be considered in relation to his administrative responsibilities of peer review, policy \ndevelopment, and quality improvement initiatives etc.  It appears that the amount of time \nspent in direct care at the CMU and as consultant/provider at other facilities severely \nlimits his ability to conduct these activities in a timely, consistent and meaningful \nmanner.  As DYS assesses the ongoing requirements for an acceptable level of medical \ncare, the overall requirements of the Medical Director position and support staff for this \nposition must be seriously considered and then clearly defined. Performance consistent \nwith these requirements should then be monitored as with any other DYS position. \n  143\n\nMedication Administration  \nMedication administration in the majority of DYS facilities did not meet current \nnursing practice standards.  Medications were prepared in advance and not always \nadministered by the nurse who prepared them, a serious misstep.  Medications also were \nrecorded before they were administered, not recorded at all or recorded at a time other \nthan when administered.  Blank spaces on the medication administration records \n(MAR’s) were not reported as medication errors as required by DYS policy.   \nDYS recorded a total of 35 medication errors for a 12-month period for all \nfacilities.  Reviews of MAR’s at every facility showed that one facility easily could have \nthat many errors in one month with omissions (medications not given as ordered) alone.  \nThere is no assessment of the impact of the medication error whether it’s the wrong \nmedication, medication administered to the wrong person, effects of a double dose due to \nrecording errors, or not giving the medication because it was not available, and so on.  \nThere are several layers of risk involved:  not giving medications as prescribed may \ncontribute to worsening of the illness and require more complex treatment as a result; and \noverdosing can result in an extreme response requiring emergency care or hospitalization. \n DYS is also at financial risk for the medications as ordered and the cost of \nadditional care and treatment.  \nMedications can be ordered on an as needed basis; to deal with recurring pain is \none example of when this usually occurs.  The physician's order usually specifies the \nnumber of hours that must lapse between doses (\"one dose every three to four hours\") \nand may also include the maximum number of doses that can be administered within a \n24- hour period (for a maximum of eight doses).  DYS currently makes this type of \nmedication available upon request (as it should be) at breakfast, lunch and dinner-regular \nmedication times.  The purpose of as needed or \"PRN\" medications is to effectively \ncontrol or maintain a manageable level of pain or to diminish the acuity of an asthma \nepisode.  These medications must be available by request and consistent with the assessed \nneed for them 24 hours per day, as ordered. \nOne facility has self-administered medications for all youth.  Individually labeled \nmedications, including the youth’s name, the name and dose of the medication and the \nfrequency of administration identified are provided for each youth.  The youth and \n  144\n\nsupervisory staff member both sign that the medication was administered, refused etc.  \nThis is evidence of a program that provides education on the importance and purpose of \nthe medications as ordered and engages the youth in the management of his care.  All \nfailures to comply with medications as ordered are immediately addressed by the nurse \nand documented.  Such interventions are rarely required as reported by staff and youth \nand confirmed by record review.  \nPharmacy services, especially for those facilities contracting with ODMH, are not \nroutinely monitored for timeliness and accuracy of deliveries.  Delays in providing \nmedications as ordered results in potential harm to the youth.  Delay can also result in \nadditional cost to DYS when medications must be purchased from the local pharmacy to \ncover the gap.   \nJoint monitoring of the pharmacy contract and its provisions should be conducted \nnot less than quarterly with facility staff and the pharmacy provider.  This process was \nbeing considered as we completed our visits but action had not yet been taken. \nLaboratory Services \nNurses complete blood draws and prepare samples for laboratory testing ordered \nby the physician at all but one facility.  Those facilities that use the ODRC, CMC lab \nhave experienced delays and inaccuracies in test results.  These issues are being \naddressed by ODRC and recent improvements were noted.  Those facilities that utilize \nlocal or private laboratories have had no difficulties with the timeliness of results or the \naccuracy of values as reported.   \nPhlebotomy services should be considered for the reception center due to the \nnumber of tests routinely required.   \nPhysicians initial and date lab results as they are reviewed.  There is, however, no \nprogress note that addresses variances from the lab norms and the impact, if any, on the \ncare to be provided.  This is both a documentation issue and an integration of care issue, \nas other members of the treatment team may not recognize the impact of lab values on the \nyouth’s current health status. \nInfection Control \nInfection control is not routinely addressed at the facility level.  There is an \neducational program on infection control strategies included in pre-service training and a \n  145\n\none-hour program during annual training sessions for all categories and levels of staff.  \nYouth and staff are encouraged to wash hands frequently and all facilities have \neducational posters and reminders posted on this specific topic as part of the universal \nprecautions program.   \nThere is no Infection Control Coordinator and there is no tracking or monitoring \nof infectious diseases.  This area should be developed by the DYS Medical Director, or \nby someone under his supervision, and be instituted as a recognized institutional \nprogram.  Infectious diseases must be tracked and many are required to be reported to the \nlocal health authority, e.g. sexually transmitted diseases.   \nThe occurrence of Methicillin resistant staphylococcus (MRSA) and Methicillin \nsensitive staphylococcus infections should be tracked by facility and across the system.  \nNone of this work currently is being completed.  The lack of attention to infection control \nposes a threat to youth and staff alike. Sexually transmitted diseases can be treated but \nmay require life long medication and special precautions to avoid transmitting the disease \nto sexual partners.  MRSA is treatable but can be life threatening and approximately \n18,000 die of this infection annually.              \nMedical Equipment and Space \nMedical equipment and clinic space is adequate overall.  Space for the storage of \nmedications at the smaller facilities compromises the presence of hand washing facilities \nand infection control practices for the preparation and administration of medications.   \nThe area for storage of medical and dental files at many of the facilities is inadequate and \nseems to encourage dismantling the file to “make things work better”; a dilatory practice \nthat should be prohibited.  There are no medical records technicians; nurses are \nresponsible for maintaining the medical records, which takes time away from clinical \nduties.  All areas, we are pleased to report, were clean and well maintained.    \nMedical equipment is consistent with population needs and is maintained in good \nrepair.  Dental equipment with the exception of Cuyahoga Hills also was consistent with \npopulation needs and maintained in good repair.  The status and use of medical \nequipment should be regularly reviewed so that adequate planning and timelines for \nreplacement can be established.  \n  146\n\nNone of the facilities have room for infirmary or convalescent care in the medical \narea.  The use of the ten beds in the central infirmary located at Scioto seems to be \nworking satisfactorily despite the transportation logistics that must be considered from \nboth time and cost perspectives.  Youth are transported to OSU, Columbus Children’s or \na local hospital for emergency or scheduled care and then to the central medical unit \n(CMU) for convalescence, if required.  One example of this is youth with a broken jaw \nwho have corrective surgery and then spend six weeks at the CMU.  Frequently youth are \nnot to return to the sending facility and are transported to a new parent facility upon \ndischarge.  At this time, other than improving the consistency and quality of care in the \ncentral medical unit there are no recommendations for change. \nDocumentation \nDYS policy requires documentation in multiple places and formats.  There are \nelectronic files which must be completed and then added to the paper file, there are the \nrequired shift logs, nurse sick call logs, doctor sick call logs, et al, and the medical file \nitself with S (subjective) O (objective) A (assessment) P (plan) (SOAP) notes.  Much of \nthis information is duplicative and results in gaps or incomplete documentation in each of \nthe formats required. \nThe medical record is to be a chronological and complete record or ‘story’ of the \nyouth and all aspects of care provided.  This includes each element of history (medical, \npsychiatric, developmental), each complaint, problem or need identified and the \nassessment and diagnosis in each instance through the treatment and response or outcome \nof care as provided.  DYS has improved the order and organization of the medical file but \nmuch remains to be done to make it a complete document that is an effective means of \ncommunication between shifts and disciplines. \nProblem lists should be located in the same area in each file and readily apparent \nor available in the file.  Those lists should be current and list all problems of significance; \nissues that have been treated and resolved should be so identified as indicated on the form \nin use.  Medical records should be reviewed quantitatively and qualitatively to insure that \ninformation is complete and accurate. The youth’s current status with regard to chronic \ndisease should be clearly identified on the problem list and in the plan of care. \n  147\n\nThe history reflected by the problem sheet is important to the overall care of each \nyouth and especially important to the care of those with chronic disease.  The medical \nhistory of each youth must be as complete as possible, consistent with identified \nproblems or needs and available to all members of the treatment team.  The medical \nhistory that is established initially by the physicians at SJCF sets the parameters for care \nthroughout the youth’s stay so complete integration and accuracy of all data available is \nrequired.  The current reception process does not insure that this will occur and must be \naddressed by the Medical Director and Director of Nursing.  \nPhysician notes were found to be incomplete.  They must be comprehensive and \ninclude the course of care, the problem, the treatment, and the outcome of each treatment \nprovided.  Notes should address the history and testing used to reach a diagnosis as well \nas a complete description of findings upon physical examination.  The degree of control \nshould be identified for chronic diseases and the level of acuity should be clearly stated \nfor new diseases.   \nExamples of inadequacies are as follows:  A youth with a history of asthma and \nreceiving medications was received at the parent facility and while the chronic disease \nand medications were noted, there was no statement of health status by the physician.  \nMedications were not ordered, again without any documentation on why, until six days \nlater.  \nAnother typical example is that of a youth complaining of urinary symptoms. A \nurinalysis and testing for sexually transmitted diseases (STD’s) was completed.  One \nweek following the initial appointment an antibiotic was prescribed for two weeks.  The \nphysician’s note did not indicate that he had seen the youth or the reason for medications.  \nThe urinalysis was normal and the STD testing was negative.  The physician did see the \nyouth several days after the antibiotic was started but for a new problem and made no \nmention of the youth’s response to the antibiotics or that testing had been completed and \nwas within normal limits or negative.  The note indicated only that the exam was normal.     \nAnother youth was noted as vomiting blood, an endoscopy was ordered and \ntreatment followed.  Subsequent episodes of hematemesis followed along with trips to the \nhospital and orders for additional testing.  There was no information available in the \n  148\n\nmedical file regarding the hospital visits, the results of testing or any effort by the \nphysician to follow up on these findings.   \nThese examples are representative of what was not found in physician \ndocumentation across the system of medical care.  One need not be a clinician to be \ndisturbed by our findings.  In the scheme of things, these omissions move medical care \non line with mental health, use of force/safety, and education in the frontline of remedial \nconcerns. \nVital signs that are significantly above or below the normal range for adolescents \nshould be assessed for a defined period of time with guidelines for the frequency of \nreporting results/findings to the physician.  The physician’s review of these results should \nidentify the relationship to an existing or new problem or disease.  Consistent with the \ninformation previously noted, there is no documentation in the file to indicate the \nassessments either have been completed or considered by the physician in the provision \nof care.   \nAll off site evaluations and appointments require a face-to-face appointment with \nthe physician and youth to present and discuss the results and the plan of care.  \nDocumentation of this meeting should be available in the progress notes as well as the \nindividual plan of care that has been documented.  This process, if it occurs, is not being \ndocumented. \nYouth injury assessments must include a description of the activity or event that \nled to the nurse’s examination as well as the description of injuries and the action taken.  \nSymptoms reported by youth should be verbatim and without interpretation.  \nAssessments that are incomplete or documentation that is incomplete regarding the signs \nand symptoms described by the youth may result in inadequate or improper treatment.  \nThere were numerous examples of youth who complained of symptoms consistent with \nurinary tract infections.  These youth, depending on the nurse’s note or the verbal \ninformation provided over the phone but not documented, were not seen by the physician.  \nThose youth who continued to complain of symptoms were eventually seen, 2-3 weeks \nafter the initial complaint, and testing was then completed.  In one of these cases, \ntreatment was initiated only after identification by a team member, despite test results \n  149\n\nthat clearly identified a urinary tract infection requiring treatment had been available in \nthe medical file for approximately one month. \nInterval histories, contacts with medical services, need to be made available for \nphysicians at the time of appointments.  This is especially important for youth with \nchronic diseases.  Failure to report or note interval histories resulted in medications being \ncontinued as usual when data indicated a change was required or should have been \nconsidered.  The continuing lack of effective communication and documentation \ncompromises the quality of care being provided. \nQuality Improvement \nQuality improvement is identified as an initiative encompassed by DYS but there \nis no evidence that the techniques are currently in use.  Statistical data is collected and \nsubmitted to a variety of central office areas but there is no evidence the information is \nused in any fashion.  There is no quality assessment and monitoring program for facility \nclinical and program services; no needs assessment of the population to insure that \nprogramming exists to meet those existing needs; and there are no outcome measures for \nindividual levels of treatment or any aspect of medical or mental health care.  \nNursing staff at the privately contracted medical services at Marion complete \nmonthly quality assurance forms as required by the parent company.  These requirements \ndo not appear to have been adapted to an adolescent population rendering their usefulness \nquestionable. Completing questionnaires on adult standards of care, the care typically \nprovided by employees of the company, does not address the identified needs of an \nadolescent population. Even if the criteria for review were to be made consistent with \nadolescent standards of care, the topics change monthly.  The change in topic makes it \nimpossible to determine if the criteria used (the previous month) are pertinent to the \nactual provision of care or to determine if any change or trend has been noted based on \ninformation previously collected.   \nIn the case of dental quality assurance, which had been completed for one month \nas required, there was no evidence in the dental or medical files to support the findings \nthat had been submitted.  The areas being monitored included the nurse’s assessment of \ncomplaints of dental pain, the treatment initiated and the follow up assessment and care \nprovided by the dentist.   \n  150\n\nAn active quality improvement program should be established at each facility and \nthe provision of care should be monitored and assessed on a regular basis.  The program \nshould include peer review at regular intervals and qualitative and quantitative medical \nrecord reviews at a minimum. \nEducation on Health Issues, Medication, Nutrition, and Personal Hygiene \nDYS nursing staff have developed educational modules for pregnancy, chronic \ndisease, nutrition and personal hygiene classes.  Nurses complete these modules with \nyouth during intersession and, as required, on a one-to-one basis. Youth seem to enjoy \nand learn from these sessions.  Youth frequently identify topics to be included in the \ncurriculum.  The success of the program is based on verbal reports from youth because \ndocumentation of the key points presented and the youth’s comprehension and ability to \napply the information to his/her care is not consistently available.  Many of these topics \ncould be considered for inclusion the educational program in the Science and Health \nclasses.  The advantage of adding these topics to the education curriculum would make \nthe information available to a larger population and qualify for educational credit for the \nyouth participating.  \nThere is an informed consent form and notification process for youth and family \nwhen psychotropic medications are ordered.  Mohican has a program developed \nspecifically for adolescents with pictures and uncomplicated terminology that can be \nunderstood and used by youth. This program reportedly was shared with other Health \nCare Administrators but it was not in evidence in any other facility.  Notification to \nparents/family was months behind at one facility.  Notifications at another facility were \ncompleted only with the appointment of a psychology supervisor and immediately prior \nto a Cohen team visit.  \nYouth should be engaged in mental health care and the psychiatrist does \ndocument the risks and benefits of the medications as ordered in her appointment \nsummary.  Family members should also be engaged in this care and have this information \nmade available in a timely manner.  Medical nurses are responsible for the administration \nof the medications as ordered and should also be confirming that the consent process has \nbeen completed.  This does not routinely occur. \n  151\n\nThere is no educational requirement or process used for medications ordered for \nmedical purposes.  Nurses’ report providing a basic description of what the drug is \nintended to do but there is no documentation to confirm that this has occurred.  Classes \non similar medications, the purpose, use, risks and benefits should be considered. \nDocumentation should include the participants, the information presented and the \nindividual’s ability to use the information in a meaningful manner. \nPeople who understand a disease process and the impact of the disease, now and \nin the future, are more likely to participate in their own care and address medical needs in \na more timely and responsible manner.  DYS has a captive audience and the opportunity \nto develop a program and relationships with medical providers to enhance the provision \nand quality care for youth.  They also have, but do not use, these opportunities to develop \npositive medical relationships with the limited numbers of youth with chronic disease. \nMental Health Treatment Plans46\nYouth engaged in mental health programs are seen by and involved with \neducators, nurse, and physicians.  These individuals should have a working knowledge of \nthe plan of care for these youth and any special needs that have been identified.  \nCurrently, mental health treatment plans are not individualized or completed by a \nmultidisciplinary treatment team.  The psychiatrist addresses future plans and any \neducation provided in a narrative summary following each individual session.  This \ninformation is available in both the medical and mental health file, usually within seven \ndays following the appointment.   \nNo other mental health information, beyond the initial intake screen, is available \nto medical staff.  It would be preferable to have one medical record that housed all \ninformation but short of that there must be some form of communication so that nurses \nand physicians can respond to behaviors as prescribed in the individualized mental health \ntreatment plan and in concert with mental health staff members.  Medical staff should be \nrepresented on the interdisciplinary treatment team.   \nThe plans that are in use are restrictive and concentrate on extinguishing \nbehaviors without offering acceptable behaviors or developing new skills to resolve \n                                                 \n46 Despite the potential redundancy with Section IV on mental health, I elected to retain these comments \nsince they come from a nurse and a physician. \n  152\n\nproblems effectively.  Mental health services require immediate and ongoing attention \nand they require integration with medical services. \nSpecial Management Plans \nSpecial management plans are used as a disciplinary tool for youth who \nfrequently aggressive or flagrantly violate institutional rules.  There are three levels of \nspecial management plans with the least restrictive generally used for youth receiving \nmental health services.   \nThese plans, like current mental health plans, are based on extinguishing \nbehaviors without offering acceptable alternatives.  There is a team approach to special \nmanagement plans usually including the Superintendent, Psychology Supervisor and \nCustody staff.  Excluded medical staff should be represented at these meetings to \ncoordinate elements of necessary medical treatment. There does not appear to be any \nassessment of facts beyond the immediate charge or violation.  There is no review of the \noutcome of the plans when used previously or the frequency of use of the same plan for \nthe same youth for the same problem.  All this data would be useful in developing a \nmeaningful plan.  For example, the special management plans in use at Indian River uses \nthe guidelines that were developed for these plans as the plan itself.  The guidelines were \nintended as a starting point to the development of a plan that would meet individual youth \nneeds even when the only consideration is discipline or correction of a recurring problem \nbehavior. \nStaffing for Physicians and Nurses and Related Areas \nStaffing allocations for nurses and physicians, and related support staff, medical \nrecords technicians, phlebotomists and secretarial support are inadequate for the current \nnumber of youth housed in DYS facilities requiring a safe environment, education and \ntreatment for medical and mental health issues.  \nThe number of positions allocated for nursing staff does not appear to have \nincluded a relief factor for these 24/7 positions that is consistent with DYS benefit/leave \npolicies.  If professional competency were maintained at the highest levels, the current \nnumbers of staff without consideration for days off, vacation and sick leave, disability \nand occupational injury leave would still leave a deficit and create problems for youth \nand staff alike.  \n  153\n\nMandated overtime is being used less in this staffing area because staff members \nnow have the opportunity to schedule overtime in advance. Mandated shifts do occur \nwith regularity to meet institutional minimums although nursing staff at most of the \nfacilities make every effort to work out leaves in advance and minimize the need for \nmandated overtime to occur.  These efforts should be recognized but do not eliminate the \nneed for a relief factor to be included in identifying staffing allocations. \nConcerns about actual numbers of staff available must be tempered by the time \nnow utilized for programs and individual or group services.  The educational program, \nfor example, takes priority over many daytime hours and suggests that clinical staff \nshould have non-traditional schedules.  Staffing dynamics and priorities should be \nexamined and an overall approach to staffing then developed.   \nBefore the numbers of staff required for clinical service can be realistically \nevaluated the roles and responsibilities of these care providers and support personnel \nneed to be clearly defined.  The priority is to provide a safe, healthy environment with \nzero tolerance for aggression from youth and staff alike.  Within the context of no verbal \nor physical aggression, staff members have to learn how to lead and provide behavioral \nvalues in the course of daily tasks.  Youth and adults need to understand that behavior has \nconsequences but that proper consequences do not insure proper behavior.  Rules should \nbe simple, clear and enforceable but not designed to delay or remove access to care.  \nEnforcing the rules should be completed in a consistent and dispassionate manner-not by \nmanipulating rewards and punishment.  The repetitive nature of explaining and enforcing \n(saying what you mean and meaning what you say) rules should be a responsibility not \nonly of staff members but of youth who can take on leadership roles within their own \npeer group to aid in the management of day to day activities.  (Lighthouse Youth Center \nat Paint Creek is an excellent example of this approach.) \nClinical services should be clearly defined and provided in a timely and \nprofessional manner while incorporating the goals identified for each youth in education, \nmental health care, and in concert with medical care.  DYS had adequate policies in most \nof these areas and encourages or requires facilities to develop local procedures or \nprotocols for many of these policies and yet the deficits and lack of timeliness continue to \noccur (e.g. medication administration, documentation, integration of available \n  154\n\ninformation).  As noted above, the rules should be simple and clear.  These same rules \nshould be enforced consistently and dispassionately.  The quality of care and services \nshould be monitored and assessed consistently at the local and central level, as should the \navailability and competency of staff.  \nThe difficulty in recruiting competent medical staff for existing positions is a \nrecurring theme.  Given the duration of existing vacancies in facilities consideration \nshould be given to adjusting pay rates to competitive levels with the private sector and to \nconsidering additions to the benefit package.   \nThe current organizational structure does not encourage thinking, the sharing of \neffective ideas or decision-making that benefit youth.  Encouraging the growth of \nprofessional staff and providing evidence that creative thought and approaches are valued \nshould also contribute to successful recruitment and retention of competent and \ncommitted staff. \nStaffing recommendations for medical and related staff follows as Attachment 1.  \nNumbers of existing positions were provided by DYS; recommended numbers are \nbaseline figures and computed on current duties and expectations but not done by \nlocation.  These numbers are also related to current population levels.  Hours of work \nshould be consistent with youth and programmatic need and the availability of family. \nNurse practitioners should be added to the staffing mix to complement the number \nof physicians and to provide clinical supervision for nursing staff.  \nNutrition \nDYS provides a 3300-calorie diet, which is consistent with adolescent needs.  \nThose with special dietary requirements appear to be accommodated and educated.  \nPregnant females are to have meals adjusted to meet the demands of pregnancy in \nadolescence.  These comments are based on the existence of these guidelines.  The \nnutrition program was not adequately assessed to determine the efficacy of the program \nor individual factors. The girls at Scioto frequently complained that pregnancy diets were \nnot adequate. \nComments \nThere is a crisis of leadership at the Deputy Director level that is reflected at the \nfacility level.  The lack of direction and programming that is evident at the facility level \n  155\n\nseems to be generated from Central Office since communication and collaboration are not \nin evidence.  The messages to those in the field are incomplete and inconsistent at best.  \nThere does not seem to be an acknowledgement that removing a previously accepted \napproach requires both a simple explanation of why and a replacement.  The same error \nthat is being made with youth on special management plans is being made with \nemployees.  The impact of these errors for youth and for staff is not easily measured but \nit clearly prohibits the accomplishment of providing a safe environment for youth or staff. \nSummary \nThe Medical Team visited Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility, Marion Juvenile \nCorrection Institution, Indian River Juvenile Correction Institution and Cuyahoga Hills \nJuvenile Correction Facility in August and September of 2007.  Ohio River Valley also \nhad a medical but no dental review and basic nursing services were reviewed at each \nfacility the Core team visited.  Youth interviews were conducted at every facility visited. \nFindings \n•  Medical care and the documentation of the care provided require close attention.  \nThere must be a program established for the recognition and care of chronic \ndiseases identified in this adolescent population.  There must be greater attention \npaid to developmental norms and to the standards of care for an adolescent \npopulation.     \n•  There must be additional attention to the special needs of female adolescents in all \naspects of programming and care.  Developmental milestones for physical and \nemotional development should be identified and used in the provision of care and \neducation.  Dietary and physical activity behaviors should be monitored and \ndesigned to engage youth in healthy lifestyle choices that can transfer to a \ncommunity setting. \n•  Acute care is provided consistent with need but is not addressed as part of \nongoing care to diminish the requirement for an emergency response and to \nengage the youth in managing his/her own health care effectively. \n•  Access to medical staff is adequate and nurses are available 24/7 on site for all but \nFreedom Center.  The night nurse at Scioto reports to Freedom Center if needed \nduring the nighttime hours. \n  156\n\n•  Education on preventing disease is reported as being provided but, if it is, is \ninadequately documented.  The prevention of disease and normal human \ndevelopment should be a recognized part of both medical and educational \nprograms and particularly important in an adolescent population. \n•  Plans of care for medical and mental health needs should be individualized and \navailable in the medical file for the multidisciplinary treatment team that must be \ndeveloped. \n•  Quality improvement programs and infection control must be developed. \n•  The dietary and nutritional programs should be assessed to insure compliance \nwith available standards of care for adolescent populations. \n•  Medical staffing should be adjusted to meet operational demand and to set a \nstandard for care in the absence of nationally recognized staffing ratios, \n•  An active program of health care that is multidisciplinary in approach and \nsupported by policy and procedure is a current requirement.  Engaging youth in \nunderstanding their own needs and participating in care should be a focus of all \nprograms. \n  157\n\nATTACHMENT 1 \n \n \nStaffing Recommendations47\n1.  There must be a relief factor established and considered for all nursing positions. \n2.  Credentials must be consistent with the population served; e.g. family practice \nphysicians. \n3.  Competency of all staff should be regularly assessed and consistent with program \nexpectations as described in position descriptions. \n4.  Peer review should be completed for each professional employee on a regular \nbasis. \nPhysician  Current 22 hours/week  Recommend: 60 hours/week plus \nspecialties \nNurse  Current 48.5 hours/week  Recommend: 60 hours/week \n(Marion not included) \nMedical Records Tech  Current 0  Recommend: 1 for large facilities; \n0.5 for small facilities \nHealth Info Tech  Current 0  Recommend: 1 for large facilities; 0.5 \nfor small facilities to complete \nscheduling of appointments, etc. \nPhlebotomist    Recommend: 6-15 hours/week \ndepending on facility need. \n \nThe baseline recommendations considered current duties and expectations but not \nlocation or facility security levels.  Hours of work should be consistent with program \nneeds and the availability of youth as well as family members.  The increase in nurses \nshould include nurse practitioners that would complement the physician numbers and \nprovide clinical supervision for registered nurses.  The projections for physicians include \nestablishing chronic care clinics and an effective healthcare education program.   \n                                                 \n47 We offer these recommendations at least as starting points for any subsequent negotiations that follow \nthis Report. \n  158\n\nDENTAL (ORAL) SERVICES \nJuveniles’ legal right to dental care is of equal significance to the undoubted right \nto mental health and medical care.  Indeed, NCCHC, Standards, Y-A-01 Access to Care \nreads, “Juveniles have access to care to meet their serious medical, dental, and mental \nhealth needs.”  NCCHC promotes timely access to a licensed dentist and the compliance \nindictors, Y-E-06 are: \n1.  All aspects of the standard are addressed by written policy and defined \nprocedures. \n2.  Oral screening by the dentist or qualified health care professionals trained \nby the dentist is performed within 7 days of admission to the correctional \nsystem. \n3.  Instruction in oral hygiene and preventive oral education are given within \n14 days of admission. \n4.  An oral examination is performed by a dentist within 60 days of \nadmission. \n5.  Oral treatment, not limited to extractions, is provided according to a \ntreatment plan based upon a system of established priorities for care. \n6.  Radiographs are appropriately used in the development of the treatment \nplan. \n7.  Consultation through referral to oral health care specialists is available as \nneeded. \n8.  Each juvenile has access to the preventive benefits of fluorides in a form \ndetermined by the dentist to be appropriate for the needs of the individual. \n9.  Where oral care is provided on site, contemporary infection control \nprocedures are followed. \n10. Extractions are performed in a manner consistent with community \nstandards of care and adhering to the American Dental Association’s \nclinical guidelines. \nThe American Public Health Association, Standards for Health Services in \nCorrectional Institutions, p. 111 (2003), notes: \n  159\n\nDental caries (soft, decayed area in a tooth) and fractured front teeth are \nthe most common physical health problems among incarcerated youth.  \nMoreover, adolescence is the age of greatest incidence of caries in the \npermanent molar teeth.  Filling existing caries and application of pit and \nfissure sealants to intact molars are highly effective interventions to stop \nfurther deterioration and preserve the permanent teeth into adult life. \nThere is not a great deal of case law in the area of correctional dentistry.  What \nexists is exemplified by Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 555, 576 (10th Cir. 1980), “[D]ental \ncare is one of the most important medical needs of inmates.” See also Hartsfield v. \nColburn, 371 F.3d 454 (8th Cir. 2004), on pre-trial detainee, dental care rights. \nI need not repeat here what was previously written about competing constitutional \nsources for the right and my belief that juvenile status argues for a more expansive test \nfor mandated care than a narrow reading of the Estelle, “seriousness” – “deliberate \nindifference” test. \nCaries are endemic to youth and, interestingly, caries was considered to be a \nserious condition by the Second Circuit on the theory that it is a degenerative condition \nlikely to produce agony, loss of the afflicted tooth, or even infection.  Thus, a dental \ncondition viewed by some as “minor” may legally be characterized as “serious” based on \nthe likelihood of what it may become. \nSeriousness alone, however, may not be enough if the requisite mental state is \nlacking.  In McCarthy v. Place, 2007 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 41977 (S.D. Ohio, June 8, 2007), \nthe court found that enduring six months of excruciating pain due to an untreated \ntoothache was serious.  However, the court found that deliberate indifference was lacking \nsince the dentist had an explanation for his omission and the plaintiff’s proof was \ninadequate.  Place, of course, is about damages while S.H. is about injunctive relief. \nWhat follows is the substance of the Dental Summary Report prepared by team \nexpert Donald Sauter, DDS, MPA.  Dr. Sauter concludes, “that the overall Ohio DYS \ndental program is inadequate.”  He specifies the areas of greatest deficits and \nrecommends changes needed to achieve acceptability. \n  160\n\nMethodology and Techniques \nIn preparation for the site visits, Dr. Sauter reviewed policies related to dental \nservices, Ohio State Dental Board Law and Rules, November 2006, the Ohio State Dental \nBoard Infection Control Manual, June 2004, Centers for Disease Control Guidelines for \nInfection Control in Dental Health-Care Settings – 2003, and previous site ODYS site \nvisit reports. He then developed 17 review steps to determine the extent to which the \nODYS institutions were in compliance with their P&P and providing dental care \nconsistent with the dental literature and regulatory guidelines and rules. These steps \nserved as standards to provide a focus and consistency for my reviews. \nQuality of care and level of care must be distinguished. To determine whether \ncare is of adequate quality Dr. Sauter looked to professional organizations such as the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the American Dental Association, infection \ncontrol guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as \nthe professional literature. While it may be appropriate to vary the level of care (scope of \nservices) provided, dependent on a correctional setting, length of time in custody, and the \nlike, the evidence-based literature describes minimum standards of quality for dental \nprocedures.    \nThis report is structured around five areas: 1) access to timely care, 2) adequacy \nof physical facilities, 3) quality of the providers, 4) quality of the care, and 5) overall \nprogram management.  \nRecommendations on how to achieve an “adequate” level and quality of care are \nprovided.  \nIn establishing a definition of an adequate level of care I am cognizant that the \ncorrectional environment is unique and that:  \n… the focus of correctional dentistry is the control of acute dental pain; patient \neducation of the major factors that influence oral health and general well-being; \nconsistent application of preventive dental modalities; the elimination of dental \npathology; and restoration of function … recognizing that … restoring a patient to \noptimal function is often a difficult and sometimes unattainable goal. Dental therapy in \n  161\n\nthe correctional environment should be conservative and meet the professional \nstandards of acceptable care found in other public health settings.48\nSite Visits \nSite visits were conducted at four ODYS facilities.  Dr. Sauter accompanied the \nMedical Investigation Team comprised of Barbara Peterson, RN, and Ron Shansky, MD.  \nTwo days were spent at each facility reviewing medical and dental records, interviewing \nstaff, and observing their work.  A thorough review of the dental physical plant and its \ncontents also was conducted. \nAccess to Care \nInmate Orientation to Dental Care Access \nJuveniles should have a clear idea of what dental services are afforded to them. \nThey should know that emergent care is readily accessible and that routine care may \nrequire waiting to have lower priority dental problems stabilized. Juveniles should have \ndetailed information regarding entitled care. \nWe recommend that the ODYS develop a policy regarding inmate access to acute \nand routine dental treatment. HSAs and dentists should work together to develop a \nsystem for patient education to include an oral and written presentation describing, in \ndetail, procedures for accessing each level of dental care provided at their institution. \nAccess to Oral Hygiene Supplies \nAn inspection of the personal hygiene kits distributed to the juveniles was \nconducted.  Dental floss was not present in any of these kits.  Dental floss loops were \navailable for distribution at IRJCF but the system was cumbersome and provides a \ndisincentive for the juvenile to floss.  \n It is recommended that floss in some form be made available to the juveniles.  It \nis necessary to maintain good oral hygiene.  Arguments about “safety” are essentially \nbaseless. \nUrgent Care \nThe current system of making appointments for patients with complaints of pain \nresults in some patients not being assessed and stabilized in a timely manner.   Dental and \n                                                 \n48 Makrides NS, Costa JN, Hickey DJ, Woods PD, Bajuscak RE.  Correctional Dental Services, in Puisis \nM. Clinical Practice in Correctional Medicine, 2nd ed. (Mosby, 2006). \n  162\n\nmedical records were reviewed of patients with chief complaints of pain in DIT -1049.  \nSome nursing entries in the medical progress notes documented adequate stabilization of \npain while others did not.  The stabilization of pain by the nurses is inconsistent.  The \nSOAP format was not used for any of the dentist entries. \nThe lag between a Nurse Health Call or HSR request for pain and stabilization by \na dentist is excessive.  The ODYS is not providing timely (within 24 hours) stabilization \nof dental pain.  \nJuveniles with urgent dental conditions must be able to obtain stabilization of pain \nwithin 24 hours.  The nurses should receive training in triaging and stabilizing dental \npain. Nurses should consistently document the assessment of patients requesting dental \ncare.  Furthermore, the dentist and nurses should document emergency or essential / \nurgent dental care visits using the SOAP format.  \nBroken Appointments  \nDental patients are typically escorted to and from their appointments by a JCO.  \nAt all facilities visited the dentist gives the officer a list to maintain a continuous flow of \npatients.   At CHJCF, MaJCF, and IRJCF patients are delivered to the dental clinic in a \nmanner which minimizes down time.   SJCF, however, has problems with patient flow \ndue to lack of escorts and conflicts in programming. \nIt is recommended that the ODYS administration eliminate delays in dental \ntreatment at SJCF and all facilities where patient flow is a problem.  Juveniles should be \navailable for treatment during all the hours the dentists are present in an ODYS facility. \nQuality of Care \nScreenings and Examinations \nSJCF is responsible for the Reception Screening examinations for the ODYS \nsystem.  Records were reviewed to determine the quality and consistency of the \nScreening Exam (DIT-1). A Dental Screening Examination as defined by the ODYS \nPolicy 403.13 will: 1) expose dental bite wing x-rays, 2) examine the teeth and tissues 3.) \nidentify oral health condition 4) specify the priorities of treatment by category. These \nscreenings must be documented on the Dental Record (ODYS DMH-0059). Therefore, if \n                                                 \n49 DIT-1 through DIT-17 can be found in each site visit report completed by Dr. Sauter.  Those reports are \nappended at part of Appendix C. \n  163\n\nany of the elements of the examination are not present (care prioritized into categories, \noral health condition, diagnostic bite wing x rays, ODYS dental form DMH-0059, etc), \nthe examination is incomplete and out of compliance with ODYS policy.   \nThe records reviewed at each facility in DIT-1 showed all inmates had Reception \nCenter Nurse Screening and Assessment and a Dental Screening Examination.  However, \nmost of the Dental Screening exams were incomplete.   Priorities of care were not \nspecified on all of the charts.  The need for an annual follow up exam was not \ndocumented in all the records.  Timeliness of exams was largely in compliance with \nODYS policy 403.13, except at Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile Correctional Facility. \nODYS policy 403.13 requires the development of an individualized treatment \nplan for juveniles receiving dental care.  Most charts reviewed did not have a documented \nindividualized treatment plan.  Some charts listed carious lesions, but they were not \nprioritized.  Thus there was no treatment plan, just a list of problems. \nControls must be put in place to ensure that juveniles be provided examinations as \noutlined in ODYS Policy 403.13.   \nPrimary Prevention  \nIn DIT-1, 10 records were reviewed at each facility to measure the level and \nquality of dental care provided at intake, and compliance with ODYS policy.   While all \nthe juveniles had documentation of an initial dental prophylaxis and oral hygiene \ninstruction, none had received topical fluoride treatments.  Some topical fluoride is being \napplied at follow up dental prophylaxis visits,  but the method of delivery (on floss or \npainted on the teeth) is ineffective.  Fluoride varnish would be an effective way of \nplacing topical fluoride.   \nIt is recommended that an effective method of topical fluoride application is \nutilized as part of primary caries prevention in ODYS.   \nDental Sealants    \nNone of the charts reviewed of juveniles who had been at in ODYS for at least 13 \nmonths had any documentation of sealant placement.  An interview with one dentist \nrevealed he did not feel sealants were an appropriate treatment as he had seen caries \nassociated with some sealant placement.  Sealant placement and topical fluoride \ntreatments, however, are recommended as part of primary prevention of dental caries \n  164\n\nduring the teenage years through early adulthood by the American Academy of Pediatric \nDentistry.  \nIt is recommended that the pits and fissures of non-carious permanent teeth be \nsealed to help prevent future decay. \nOral Hygiene Education \nAll of the initial dental prophylaxis and oral hygiene education is provided at \nSJCF.  One dentist was observed providing intake dental prophylaxis to three juveniles.  \nNo direct oral hygiene education was observed on the three patients being treated.   When \nthe dentist was questioned about what oral hygiene education is typically provided, he \npointed to the posters on the wall.  He said he answers questions if the youth have any. \nThe oral hygiene education program in the ODYS is inadequate.   \nIt is recommended that the ODYS develop a meaningful oral hygiene education \nprogram structured to train juveniles mindful of the disproportionate numbers that have \ndifficulty learning. \nDental Caries Stabilization - Secondary Prevention  \nMany of the patient charts reviewed in DIT-1, DIT-2, DIT-9, and DIT-10 had \ndocumentation of dental caries.  Not all the dental records reviewed of juveniles who had \nbeen in the ODYS at least 13 months had documentation that caries had been stabilized \nor was being watched due to their incipient nature unless the patient refused treatment.  \nDental records reviewed showed a systematic deficiency in the area of the monitoring \nand stabilization of dental caries.  Annual recall exams and dental prophylaxis at CHJCF \nwere not completed on time or at all in many cases.   All other facilities reviewed were \nlargely in compliance with the ODYS policy on recall exams and dental prophylaxis. \nJuveniles at Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility and Scioto Juvenile \nCorrectional Facility did have documentation of caries stabilization for those individuals \nwith stays over 13 months.   Prioritization and treatment of caries that have progressed \nbeyond the demineralization stage is recommended as part of secondary prevention of \ndental caries during the teenage years through early adulthood by the American Academy \nof Pediatric Dentistry.      \nIt is recommended that juveniles with dental caries be monitored by the dentists in \nODYS.     Dental caries should be prioritized by level of severity at the time of the initial \n  165\n\ndental exam.  Timing of recall appointments for caries stabilization should be based on \nthe level of the severity of the carious lesions.  ODYS should track annual dental \nexaminations and dental prophylaxis to insure policy compliance. \nRemovable Partial Dentures, Crowns, and Fixed Partial Dentures \nDental records were reviewed for documentation of replacement of anterior teeth \nwith fixed and removable partial dentures.  The dental literature does show some \ncorrelation between oral health, self esteem, and missing front teeth in juveniles.50 The \ndentists and HSAs were interviewed at each facility about the process of obtaining \nauthorization for fixed and removable partial dentures and full crowns.  Full crowns are \nneeded to prevent molar teeth treated with root canal therapy from fracture.  Crowns and \nbridges are needed in a small number of cases to protect and preserve badly broken down \nbut restorable front teeth. ODYS is providing removable partial dentures, fixed partial \ndentures and crowns for patients who need them.  The dentist determines the need for a \npartial denture or crown and submits the request verbally to the HSA.  There were no \nreports or documentation of partial denture or crown treatment being denied.  There were \nno dental casts or dentures available, however, to evaluate quality of prosthodontic \ntreatment. \nThe dentist determines who is to be provided with partial dentures and crowns. \nAvailability of Specialists \nDental specialists in oral surgery, orthodontics, and endodontics are available and \nutilized for patients who cannot be treated by the institution dentist. \nTreatment by dental specialists is available when needed. \nSpecial Needs Patients \nDr. Traugh, who works at 3 of the 4 facilities visited, was interviewed concerning \npatients with such special needs as mental retardation and mental health problems that \nwould make them unable to receive dental care without pre-medication.  Dr. Traugh has \nnot had a problem managing patient behavioral problems during treatment.  No inability \nto treat patients due to behavioral problems was noted in any of the documents reviewed. \n                                                 \n50 See, Patel RR, Tootla R, Inglehart MR, Does oral health affect self perceptions, parental rating and \nvideo-based assessments of children’s smiles?, Community Dent Oral Epidemiology 2007; 35:44-52; Davis \nDM, Fiske J, Scott B, Radford DR, The emotional effects of tooth loss: a preliminary quantitative study; \nBr. Dent J 2000 188: 503-506; and Margolis FS, The esthetic space maintainer; Compendium Continuing \nDental Education 2001 Nov, 22(11):911-4. \n  166\n\nGiven the high incidence of mental health problems in juvenile justice facilities, \nthe issue of special needs management of dental patients should be monitored by the \nODYS. \nQuality Management \nQuality Assurance \nMarion Juvenile Correctional Facility is the only institution visited where there \nwas documentation of a dental quality assurance program.   One quality assurance \n“screen” was:  “Significant dental conditions are recorded on the problem list”.  The QA \nreport said this in 100% compliance.  A review of dental records revealed this was not the \ncase. \nAnother QA screen measured was: “All dental sick call requests from the \nprevious 90 days were triaged within 24 hours”.  The QA screen rated compliance as \nN/A.  This dental program component should have been monitored, as it is one of the \nmost important functions of the dental program.  Many of the nursing assessments of \ndental complaints were found to be inadequate.  Since nurses are responsible for \nstabilization of dental pain in the absence of the dentist.  As nurses do the intake dental \nscreenings they are also responsible for recognizing and triaging dental disease.   \nDeficiencies in the dental program simply are not being addressed by the current quality \nassurance program.    \nThe Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility dental quality assurance program was \nrated as ineffective. \nPeer Review \nThere was no documentation of a dental peer review program in ODYS \nA clinically-oriented, dental quality assurance and peer review program must be \ndeveloped and become part of ODYS policy.  This system should have thresholds by \nwhich deficiencies in procedure, quality, or appropriateness can be corrected.  \nDental Record Documentation  \nHealth History \nA copy of the Nurse Intake Screening form was attached to each dental record \nexcept at CHJCF where the medical and dental records are combined.  This screening \nform contains a health history which is competed by interviewing the patient and it is \n  167\n\nadequate to address conditions that may affect the health of the patient undergoing dental \ntreatment.   The nurse will note dental abnormalities in the dental section of this form. \nThe health history available to the dentist during treatment is adequate to identify \nconditions where precautions should be taken or physician consultations are needed. \nTreatment Plans \nODYS dental policy 403.13 requires a treatment plan to be created that \ndocuments dental priorities by category.  Review of records in DIT-1 and DIT 2 revealed \ndental problems were not prioritized by category.  The dental examination is conducted at \nSJCF.  Dental needs are listed but not prioritized at this exam.  The dental charts do not \nlist the initial components of a comprehensive treatment plan: examination, prophylaxis \nand oral hygiene education, and diagnostic radiographs.  These initial components are \nbeing completed at the reception center, but should be listed and marked complete on the \ntreatment plan.  The dental carious lesions should be listed in ascending order of severity \nso the parent institution can more effectively triage teeth that are a priority for \nstabilization to prevent tooth loss. \nIt is recommended that comprehensive dental treatment plans be created that \nprioritize dental problems by level of severity.  ODYS should revise their policy to \ndescribing the treatment planning procedure in detail.   \nSOAP Format \nThere was a consistent lack of use of the SOAP format in filling out the dental \nrecord for non-routine (urgent care) dental visits.  This should be a standard procedure \nwhen the appointment is non-routine, i.e. generated by a complaint by the juvenile.  With \njuveniles being evaluated and treated by multiple providers, it is important for each \nprovider to record and assess the patient’s chief complaint to assure it is being addressed \nand needed treatment is being provided.  The standardized SOAP format creates a \nconsistent data set, which facilitates tracking of the patient’s progress. The plan should \ninclude follow up to insure the patient is dentally stabile.   According to ODYS POLICY \n403.05.01 the SOAP format shall be used in the progress note. The SOAP format is a \nconcise and widely accepted format for documenting urgent dental care.  It focuses the \nclinician to follow a logical process in diagnosis and treatment.  \n  168\n\nIt is recommended that the ODYS Medical Director ensure policy compliance as \nthe SOAP format is used most institutional settings. \nPhysical Resources  \nEquipment Condition  \nThe dental clinics and their contents were examined at each facility.   There is a \ngeneral need at all the facilities visited for more instruments used to perform dental \nprophylaxis and caries restorative procedures.  The dental operatory at IRJCF is in good \ncondition but the clinic needs some small cabinetry changes to accommodate a dental \nassistant.   The CHJCF clinic needs complete remodeling of the cabinetry to allow for the \naddition of a dental assistant.  The MaJCF and SJCF clinics are adequate in space and \nlayout.   \nA systematic equipment and instrument inventory of all their clinics must be \nconducted.   Adequate hand instruments and other equipment should be obtained to allow \nfor uninterrupted dental care while the dentist is present.   Necessary cabinetry changes \nshould be made to allow for addition of a dental assistant.   \nHuman Resources \nDental Clinic Staffing \nThere are adequate dentist hours allocated to all the facilities visited.   However, \nlack of a dental assistant makes overall dental staffing inadequate because dentists must \nthen perform duties not commensurate with their professional competence.  Infection \ncontrol is compromised without a dental assistant available for surgical retraction, high \nspeed evacuation, instrument delivery, restraint of sudden errant patient movement, and \nproper pre and post dental operatory preparation. \nIn the interest of a more dentally stabile population, the ODYS could add dental \nhygienist hours at the parent (non-reception) facilities.  This way the dentists at SJCF \ncould focus more attention to stabilizing large carious lesions on the male juveniles prior \nto their transfer.   The initial and annual dental prophylaxis and oral hygiene education \ncould be done more effectively by a dental hygienist.  Dental hygienists could administer \neffective topical fluoride therapy.   \nThe oral hygiene education program and lack of topical fluoride application in the \nODYS is clinically inadequate.     \n  169\n\n It is recommended a dental assistant be hired to work with the dentist when \nhe/she is at the facility.  Consideration should be made to adding dental hygienists at the \nparent facilities to improve primary prevention and provide for the stabilization of caries \nearly in the juveniles stay.   \nHygienists \nOhio Department of Youth Services dental policy 403.13 requires a dental exam, \noral hygiene instruction, a dental cleaning and dental ”bite-wing” x-rays for all new \njuveniles within 14 days of admission to the ODYS.   Due to the lack of dental \nhygienists, ODYS dentists are providing the dental cleanings and oral hygiene instruction \nat the reception and non-reception facilities.   The site visit investigation revealed that the \noral hygiene instruction provided by ODYS was inadequate.   \nDental cleanings consume a significant portion of the dentist’s time at Scioto \nJuvenile Correctional Facility (SJCF).   One side effect is that male juveniles do not have \nthe access to dental caries stabilization that the current dentist staffing could provide with \nthe addition of dental hygienists and a change in the deadline for performing the dental \ncleanings and oral hygiene instruction.    \nIt is common knowledge in the dental community that dental hygienists are more \ncompetent performing dental cleaning than dentists.  They have far more training in \nremoving hard and soft deposits from teeth without damaging the tissues.   Dental \nhygienists are also more competent in providing meaningful oral hygiene education to \nindividuals with varying levels of learning ability.  This is especially important given the \nincidence of learning disabilities and mental health problems in a juvenile detention \nfacility. \nRecommendation:  Dental hygienists should be added at all facilities in the ODYS \nto improve the quality of the dental cleanings and oral hygiene instruction/education. \nHygienists: Staffing \nMany of the juveniles do not have large quantities of hard deposits on their teeth.  \nThis would allow the dental hygienist to perform the cleaning and oral hygiene education \nin about 30 minutes.   Currently fluoride treatments are not being provided at intake.  \nFluoride treatments provided later in their stay are largely ineffective as noted in the \nODYS Dental Summary Report.  The dental hygienist could provide effective fluoride \n  170\n\ntreatments consistent with Academy of Pediatric Dentistry Guidelines.   Eight dental \nhygienist hours per week per facility would be a good initial staffing level for each \nfacility.   This would be in addition to the current dentist hours.   \nRecommendation:  Eight hours per week of dental hygienist services should be \nadded at each facility.  This should be monitored for effectiveness.  \nHygienists: Costs \n  To support an estimate of costs of dental hygienist hours we quote a recently \npublished article in the Journal of Public Health Dentistry:  \nThe average dental hygienist in Cincinnati, Ohio, makes $30.00 per hour, with \nmore than half receiving retirement and health insurance benefits. \nSince the dental hygienists will be hired as contractors it is unlikely they will \nreceive any benefits.  The ODYS should expect to pay contract dental hygienists over \n$30/hour if they offer only an hourly wage. \nLicensure and Required Certificates   \nAccording to Ohio Administrative Code, all clinics must have a copy of dentists' \nand hygienists’ licensure available for review. No dental hygienist or dental assistant is \nemployed.  Documentation of current licensure of the dentists is on file at all the facilities \nreviewed.  \nQuality of Providers - Dentists \nThe dentist at CHJCF is not providing adequate follow up for caries, annual \nexaminations, and annual dental prophylaxis (DIT-2, DIT-3).  The dentist at CHJCF is \nnot removing all debris from instruments prior to sterilization (DIT-15).  The dentist at \nCHJCF has fabricated removable partial dentures without restoring dental caries.   Thus, \nthe performance of the dentist at CHJCF is believed to be inadequate.   \nThe dentist providing services at IRJCF, SJCF, and MaJCF extracted teeth \nwithout adequate dental radiographs.   Documentation shows this to be corrected \nfollowing our August 2007 site visits.  This dentist is now considered to be adequate. The \ndocumentation of the other dentists reviewed shows their care is adequate.  \nThe quality of three of the four dentists reviewed is adequate.   It is recommended \nthat the ODYS medical director monitor all dental and infection control procedures and \ntake steps to insure all the ODYS dentists are of adequate quality. \n  171\n\nQuality of Providers - Dental Assistants \nNo dental assistant was employed. \nIt is strongly recommended that the ODYS provide dental assistants to work with \nthe dentists. \nInfection Control \nSome of the barrier techniques being used in the clinic were observed.  Spore tests \nwere conducted weekly in three out of four facilities.  IRJCF was sending their tests in \nmonthly.   There was a lack of biohazard labeling on all the ultrasonic cleaners and day \nlight loaders.  The instruments were in sterile packs.  CHJCF instruments were \ncontaminated with dental cement in sterilized packs.  This debris prevents complete \nsterilization of the instruments.   Other handled and stored instruments properly.   Eye \nprotection was not provided to the patient at any of the facilities.  The ODYS dental \nprogram will be considered inadequate unless all facilities comply with accepted Center \nfor Disease Control and Prevention infection control guidelines.51   \nDental extractions are being performed without a dental assistant.  This places the \noperator and patient of risk from bloodborne pathogens.   For example, The Federal \nBureau of Prisons dental policy states, “Surgical procedures will not be performed \nwithout a dental assistant. Institutions should provide one dental assistant for each \nclinical dentist.”  This is a standard in the private and public sector dentistry.   \nIt is recommended that the HSA and dentist review the CDC Bloodborne \nPathogens Standard and follow the guidelines provided in that document.  Current \nprocedures are inadequate.  Dental surgical procedures to include extractions should not \nbe performed without a dental assistant. \nDental Program Management   \nODYS Dental Policy and Procedures   \nThe ODYS dental policy 403.13 was discussed with the ODYS Medical Director, \nDr. John Bradley, and Dr. Mark Traugh the SJCF dental contractor. Dr. Traugh works at \n5 of the ODYS facilities and thus has an excellent working knowledge of the overall \nODYS dental program.  Dr. Traugh was observed to be a very hard working and \n                                                 \n51 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health-Care \nSettings - 2003. MMWR 2003; 52(No. RR-17):[inclusive page numbers]. \n  172\n\ncommitted professional.  He takes real ownership in the overall ODYS dental program.  \nReview of the dental records of patient populations managed by Dr. Traugh show his \nconcerted effort to stabilize dental disease and promote oral health.  Dr. Traugh could be \nmuch more effective with the addition of dental hygienist and dental assistant hours at the \nfacilities he visits.   \nThe current dental policy needs to be rewritten to include instructions on \nexamination, treatment planning, categories of care, emergent, urgent and routine dental \ncare, prevention, dental prophylaxis, fluoride treatments, sealants, caries control etc.   Dr. \nTraugh’s observations and analysis of the problems lead us to believe he is capable of \ncrafting an expanded and practical ODYS dental policy and procedure manual. \nIt is recommended that the ODYS medical director work with Dr. Traugh to \nexpand the dental policy manual.  The current manual is not adequate. \nConclusion \nAs a result of this investigation we conclude that the overall ODYS dental \nprogram is inadequate.   \nIn summary, changes need to be made in the areas of: staffing (dental assistant), \ndiagnostic radiography (pre-extraction radiographs), infection control (labeling of \nbiohazards, sterilization of instruments, spore testing, gowns and patient eye protection) \nurgent care tracking (complaints of pain assessed, and consistently stabilized and \ndocumented by nursing or dental staff within 24 hours), primary prevention (fluoride \ntreatments and sealants, annual prophylaxis and adequate oral health education, access to \ndental floss),  categorizing treatment priorities-secondary prevention (caries stabilization-\nsecondary prevention, annual follow up exams, fabrication of partial dentures without \ncaries stabilization), dental record documentation (treatment plans, SOAP format), and \naccess to care (written and verbal instruction on the specifics of requesting emergency, \nurgent and routine dental care). \n \n  173\n\nIX.  RELEASE AUTHORITY \nAs the S.H. investigative team conducted its various site visits the Release \nAuthority was consistently referred to by the various youth we interviewed.  Our \nexperience at Mohican epitomizes the frustration of DYS youth with the Release \nAuthority.52   \nMohican terms itself a Therapeutic Community (TC); as a one-of-a-kind \ncorrectional facility for males with serious substance problems.  The TC program begins \nwith orientation, moves on to Phase 1 and Phase 2, which are core treatment, and \nconcludes with Phase 3, relapse prevention. \nThe entire program takes six months and eligible youth must have at least that \nmuch time remaining on their sentence. \nThe MJCF intake manager stated that she is very conscious of the time issue.  \nBecause MJCF requires a minimum six-month stay — the average length of stay is seven \nmonths — the intake manager tries to select youths that have six months or more \nremaining on their sentences.  If they do not have enough time to complete the program, \nshe will check with court personnel, the Release Authority and the youth’s probation \nofficer; \nIt appears that by the time youths are being identified as in need of this intensive \nsubstance abuse treatment program, many have less than six months remaining on their \nsentences.  Consequently, their placement time is being extended by the Release \nAuthority so that they can complete the program.   \nFor example, one youth interviewed was on ‘revocation’ status; the judge gave \nhim a 90-day revocation sentence.  He was placed in Cuyahoga Hills for 45-60 days with \na release date in July.  In June, the Release Authority added five months based on the \n“matrix offense” guidelines, considering the time it would take him to complete the \nprogram at MJCF.  He was placed in MJCF on June 17.   \nFour other youths interviewed received five, four, two and one month added time \nrespectively from the Release Authority — using the ‘matrix offense’ guidelines — in \norder to give these youths sufficient time to complete the program. \n                                                 \n52 See Section II, for additional discussion focusing on detention credit. \n  174\n\nThe youths at this facility, and every other institution, believe that the Release \nAuthority’s extension of the sentence given by the judge is unfair. \nTo our knowledge, such extensions are viewed officially as within the \nlegislatively created upper limit of the judicial disposition — age 21 — and they lack any \npretense of due process.  The youth, however, feel powerless and victimized often by \nevents beyond their control, e.g., an extended stay in reception, which results in a \nprogram time add-on. \nThe Release Authority does not assess “matrix offense” time while the youth are \nat the Scioto Intake and Reception Center.  The time is added well after a youth has \nentered an institution – not knowing up front how long they can expect to be in an \ninstitution contributes to the youth’s sense of unfairness. \nMany of the youths who are ultimately placed in the Mohican program have been \nin other institutions for brief periods of time while the selection process is ongoing.  For \nexample, one youth interviewed spent two months in Scioto, one month in Indian River \nand when released, he will have spent nearly 8 months in Mohican.  Had the referral \nprocess begun as soon as he was committed to DYS, either while he was still in the \ncounty detention center or at least while he was going through assessment at Scioto, he \nwould have begun his substance abuse treatment virtually upon commitment to DYS and \nhis bed could have been freed up three months earlier. \nThe Release Authority Board, effective on July 1, 1998, makes release and \ndischarge decisions for the Department of Youth Services.  The same legislation also \ncreated an Office of Victim Services, the judicial release process, and the requirement for \ncourts to submit a Disposition Investigation Report (DIR) for each youth committed to \nDYS.   \nThe Release Authority consists of five board members, one of whom is \ndesignated as Chair, three hearing officers, the Office of Victim Services, and support \nservices staff.  The Authority serves as the final and sole agency for release and discharge \ndecisions based on the standards of public safety and the best interests of the child.53\n                                                 \n53 Team member David Roush was our principal investigator in this area and he interviewed the following: \nSharon Haines, Jennifer Fears, Norman Hills, Terry Kennedy Mancini, C. Q. Morrison, Renee Burch, \nDoneta Riegsecker, Aldine Gaspers, Kristine Bell, Walt Fluellen, and Damita Peery. \n  175\n\nRelease Authority Functions \nThe basic functions of the Release Authority include:  \n1.  Setting the Presumptive Release Date (PRD) from institutional care and \nPresumptive Discharge Date (PDD) from DYS custody, \n2.  Completing release and discharge reviews, \n3.  Establishing expectations, \n4.  Considering input from victims, the courts, and prosecutors, \n5.  Meeting with youth, and, \n6.  Providing system quality assurance. \nThe first two functions are more objective with specified criteria for calculating \ndates and timelines for accepting or rejecting release and discharge decisions.  The \ncriteria appear to be consistent with the Ohio Juvenile Code. \nFunctions 3 through 6 are less structured and more open to the individual \ninterpretation of board members.  Allegations of inconsistency from JCF residents and \nstaff stem from the absence of clear-cut criteria along with the method of distributing \ncaseloads.  Each incoming youth to DYS is assigned a board member who is ultimately \nresponsible for his or her case throughout the DYS commitment.  Board members did not \ndescribe much interaction in the review of difficult cases.  Indeed, a frequent criticism of \nthe Release Authority is that the five members appear to function more as individuals \nthan a unified decision-making body. \nSetting Dates \nThe nature of the Ohio Code and the decision-making criteria of the Release \nAuthority predispose youth to longer stays than necessary in institutions or on parole.  \nThe courts complete a Disposition Investigation Report (DIR) that includes the arrest \nrecord, victim information, and victim impact statements.  The DYS reception process \nincludes assessments for mental health, medical, education, substance abuse, \nleisure/recreation, religious, security threat groups, Prison Rape Elimination Act, and sex \noffenders.   \n                                                                                                                                                 \nFred Cohen interviewed Sharon Haines also and held discussions with Director Stickrath and several \nattorneys. \n  176\n\nThe information combines to present a picture of the youth based largely on \nproblems and deficits.  This information combines with the Level of Service Inventory \n(LSI) and with the local juvenile court commitment order specifying the offense to \nestablish the Presumptive Release Date based on the Release Matrix (see Table 1).  DYS \nstaff and residents refer to the Release Matrix as “matrix time,” giving it a supernatural \nflavor that it actually may deserve. \nLevel of Service Inventory (LSI) \nThere are problems with the use of the LSI.  DYS is in the process of addressing \nthese issues through research by the University of Cincinnati.  Director Strickrath \nindicated that he expects the findings from the University of Cincinnati study soon.  \nNonetheless, the Release Authority was unable to respond to several of the criticisms of \nthe LSI identified by Austin (2006).54  For example, DYS has not separately normed the \nLSI for girls.  This raises the possibility that DYS misclassifies females based on the LSI \nsince males and females respond differently to the test.  \nDYS has not done an inter-rater reliability study among those individuals who \nadminister the LSI at reception.  Inter-rater reliability is a significant problem with the \nLSI. \nFinally, DYS does not account for the differences between the static and the \ndynamic factors within the LSI.  This may be addressed in the validity studies undertaken \nat the University of Cincinnati.55\nSet and Forget \nDirector Strickrath expects the University of Cincinnati study (a) to provide DYS \nwith a greater ability to identify the low risk youth and (b) to provide evidence to change \nthe criteria for setting the PRD for low risk youth and moving them quickly toward \nrelease.  The group will be called “Set and Forget” based on the relative lack of problems \nthese youth have presented in the JCFs.   \n \n                                                 \n54  James Austin, “How much risk can we take? The misuse of risk assessment in corrections.” Federal \nProbation, 70 (2), 2006.  Austin argues that inmates are not properly assessed for risk by most agencies.  \nAustin worries that too much emphasis on risk has diminished efforts to provide basic treatment \nservices. \n55 As of the cut-off date for preparing this Report, we have not had the opportunity to study the Univ. of \nCincinnati’s work on point. \n  177\n\nRelease and Finances \nThe local courts, by statute, also play a role in the release process.  The court has \njurisdiction to authorize an early release up to the Minimum Sentence Expiration Date \n(MSED).  If a court orders release before the mid-point between the commitment (minus \nlocal detention time) and the MSED, the court must provide probation services following \nthe youth’s release.  If the court orders release after the mid-point but before the MSED, \nthe youth is placed on DYS parole.  After the MSED — and most PRDs are beyond the \nMSED — the Release Authority has sole jurisdiction.  This arrangement calls attention to \nthe Presumptive Release Date, which is based on statutory requirements that tend to \nlengthen a youth’s time in the institution beyond the MSED. \nIf the court releases before the mid-point, the court supervises and pays for the \nservices.  If the court releases after the mid-point date, DYS pays for and supervises \nparole.  Like many of the decisions surrounding DYS commitments, the financial \narrangements are critical to understanding decisions.  Much of this stems from the \ncomplicated formula for state reimbursements of county expenditures for out-of-home \nplacements through RECLAIM Ohio. \nIf our description of the relationship between the courts and DYS ended here, I \nthink it would be fair to term it bewildering and needlessly influenced by considerations \nof finance.  As this narrative proceeds we will move beyond bewildering and into the \nincomprehensible. \nReview Hearings \nRelease Authority officials referred to 90-day cycles for reviews.  The Authority \nnotifies all interested parties 45-days in advance of a review hearing.  Hearing Officers \nconduct informal follow-up contacts with institutional social workers to make sure that \nthe appropriate paperwork is filed with the Release Authority.  While reluctant to indicate \nthe percentage of hearings that are postponed because of local institutional staff \nmembers’ failures to complete and submit paperwork in a timely fashion, Authority staff \nacknowledged the problem and conceded that it occurs more often than is acceptable to \nthem.  We suspect this is “code” for “a lot.” \nWhen asked to explain the reason for this problem, most indicated that JCF social \nworkers have too many youth on their caseloads and have other duties that distract them \n  178\n\nfrom completing the paperwork.  This is yet another example where the number of \npositions assigned to fulfill various functions within the institution is insufficient to \nachieve institutional goals. \nRelease Authority personnel conveyed the impression to Dave Roush and Fred \nCohen that they are an embattled group.  Several board members emphasized their \nadvocacy for youth, which they believe goes largely unnoticed because of all the \nconstraints placed upon their decision-making by Ohio law.   \nWhen challenged on issues about length of treatment, about incentives or good \ntime, or about reducing a youth’s exposure to a dangerous institutional setting, the \nAuthority officials acknowledged the concerns but blamed their patterns of decision-\nmaking on systems issues that constrain their discretion.  While this is likely the case in \nmany instances, these protests should not disguise the institutionalized commitment to \npublic safety.  This takes the form of continued incarceration even when it is known (or \nbelieved) that the DYS intervention itself may aggravate the youth’s perceived risk to \npublic safety.  Youth advocacy aside, the Release Authority board members seem clear in \ntheir commitment to make a quality decision about who is ready for release, and “public \nsafety” trumps “the best interest of the child” every time. \nThis is yet another decisional point where childcare rhetoric is trumped by the \nadultification-law enforcement model.  Efforts to treat and rehabilitate are blunted at the \nback end of the system.   \nThe quality of release decisions depends on the quantity and quality of \ninformation coming in from the institutions, and hearing officers repeatedly complained \nthat this is their greatest concern.  In the absence of useful information, hearing officers \nmust increase the amount of time taken to review a file because they have to follow-up \nwith youth and staff or locate information from various files. \nPrior to PRD \nSuperintendents and Regional Administrators may submit a request for a special \nreview for an early release of a youth if his or her circumstances change.  When asked if \nanyone was aware of a superintendent submitting a special request, board member Hills \nindicated he had received two from newly minted Superintendent Oprisch at the Indian \n  179\n\nRiver Juvenile Corrections Facility (Oprisch has been with DYS for about six months).  \nHe approved only one.   \nThis is a telling example about the Release Authority.  First, no one presented the \nspecial review strategy as being advocated by DYS.  Second, even though the numbers \nwere small, it seems particularly problematic that the Release Authority would deny any \nspecial review request from an institutional superintendent or regional administrator, \nexcept on the basis of technicalities or statutory constraints.  In an era of site-based \nmanagement, the centralization of the release function increases the disconnect between \ninstitution and release decisions.  Denial of a special review and an early release likely \nundermines the authority of the superintendent in the eyes of JCF residents.  Hopefully, \nthe denial was based on a technicality or statutory constraint.   \nPerceived Needs \nWhen asked what was needed to make things run more efficiently, Release \nAuthority staffers suggested (a) improved internal communications, (b) program \ndevelopment based on effective outcomes as opposed to whatever was the popular \nstrategy of the day, (c) a better fit between placements for youth and safe environments to \nremedy the inability to separate vulnerable from predatory youth, (d) a shift in facility \noperations that returns the juvenile correctional officer to the primary correctional \nintervention (a caregiver model), (e) a return to single occupancy rooms, and (f) \nprograms and services that meet the needs of girls.   \nThe Release Authority board members agreed that it is time for a complete \nrevision of the Juvenile Code.  The current code dates from 1984, and many Release \nAuthority staff find it as problematic as we do. \nRevocation \nRevocations are done by the local juvenile court.  There are two general pathways \nto revocation, one through the Bureau of Parole and the other through juvenile court \ninitiative usually based on commitment of a new felony offense or community outcry.  \nThe Release Authority does not play a role in either process.   \n  180\n\nIt is important to understand the financial arrangements associated with the \ndifferent types of revocation.  First, when a juvenile court revokes the probation or parole \nof a youth that it released from a DYS institution before the mid-point date, the juvenile \ncourt usually pays the entire amount of the youth’s re-incarceration at a JCF.  Second, if \nthe court revokes a youth released by DYS, the court typically pays only the first 30 days \nof the revocation. \nData on revocations appear similar to the demographics of DYS commitments.  It \nis difficult to determine any increased level of disproportionate minority involvement in \nrevocations beyond that already present in the commitment process.  \nBureau of Parole Revocations \nDYS Parole supervises the youth’s reintegration to the  community.  In addition to \nthe conditions for parole, the Bureau supplies a range of program and services to assist \nthe youth in adjusting to the community.  When youth do not comply with the terms of \nparole, technical violations occur.  The Bureau has a range of administrative sanctions \nthat include verbal house arrest, electronic monitoring, altering parole conditions or \nextending discharge, last chance agreements (sometimes these occur in the home and \nserve as official notice to parents), petitioning a youth back to court for an official \ntongue-lashing.  These strategies help the parole officer keep the youth in the community.   \nWhen this approach fails, the Bureau can petition the juvenile court for a hearing \nwith an attorney to revoke the DYS parole, based on an accumulation of documented \nviolations.  When this occurs, the court typically pays the first 30 days of costs incurred \nby the revocation.  The Bureau of Parole estimates roughly one third or more of the \nrevocations occur in this manner. \nRe-Offense Revocations \nThe Bureau estimates that about two-thirds of revocations occur as the result of a \nsubstantial problem in the community, such as committing a new felony offense or in \nsome fashion eliciting “public outcry” about public safety.  We understand that this basis \nfor revocation is legally dubious, certainly without further explanation, which we are \ncurrently unable to provide at this time.  One generalization by the Bureau is that this \nsecond strategy normally occurs in larger counties because of the lack of re-entry \nprograms, services, and resources. \n  181\n\n \nChallenges \nThe primary problem facing the Bureau of Parole is the unpredictability of release \ndates.  The second major problem is the inability of the JCFs to prepare youth for re-\nentry.  Youth do not appear to have sufficient employment skills, employment strategies, \nor appropriate places to live following release from the JCF.  The magnitude of this \nstatement of a problem is belied by its brevity.  Readiness for release and an affirmative \nrelease environment are critical elements in that continuity of care process. \nSummary and Recommendations \nThe DYS release, discharge, and revocation processes are complicated, involving \nmany factors that impact the discretion of the individuals charged with making decisions \nin these areas.  Even the success of RECLAIM Ohio adds a level of complication to the \nrelease, discharge, and revocation equations based on how reimbursement is calculated \nand when it occurs in the sequence of events.  It will take more than the limited time we \nhave had to understand more fully the DYS system of release, discharge, and revocation.  \nHowever, our time was sufficient to acquire enough information to form impressions, to \ndiscover patterns, and to identify recommendations for improvement consistent with the \nobjectives of this investigation. \nThe Release Authority staff is an interesting combination of individuals with \nvarious specialties and experiences.  Two hearing officers were former JCF \nsuperintendents, as was the chief of the Bureau of Parole.  Among this mix of DYS \nstaffers, it is difficult to find anyone who consistently endorses the JCF interventions as \neffective.  Instead, staffers readily admit to safety problems stemming from a lack of \nprogram and treatment consistency and from too many youth with too few staff who too \noften opt for security over reformation.   \nSeveral changes warrant consideration: \n1.  The sense of a system out-of-balance starts with the Ohio Code.  Any \nsettlement should include a commitment to further study and revision of \nthe relevant statutory provisions. \n2.  Statutory constraints on release and discharge decisions are weighted \nagainst the youth and add to a youth’s time.  These constraints need re-\n  182\n\nthinking from a procedural, operational, and decision-making basis.  That \nis, the youth should not be penalized with additional time when staff or the \nsystem cause reception, transfer and paperwork delays and review \npostponements. \n3.  The special review should become a clearly defined and articulated \nprocedure advocated by the Release Authority and Central Office as a \nmeans to strengthen (a) site-based management, (b) the creation of \nincentives for appropriate youth behaviors, and (c) the reduction of the \naverage length of stay (ALOS), thus assisting if only slightly in lessening \ncrowding. \n4.  There is a troubling overemphasis on the JCFs as the location for services and \ntreatments specified by the Release Authority when setting the individual’s \nrelease expectations.  When staff generally criticize JCF treatment services as \nineffective and then postpone release until the completion of such a program, the \nprocess appears singularly punitive.  There should be an expansion of step-down \nmechanisms whereby youth can receive certain specified treatment programs in \nthe community.  \n     \n  183\n\n \nTable 1.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE, YOUTH ADVOCATE & DISCIPLINE \n \nGrievances \nAt a meeting in his office, I asked Mr. Rufus Thomas, then DYS Chief Inspector, \nif he thought the DYS grievance process was working.  His candid response was, “The \nquality of the response is the weakest part.” \nA recent internal review of the youth grievance process, culminated in a Report \nfrom Andrew Propel, Office of Project Management (OPM), dated September 6, 2007.  \nThe Report noted the importance of the process without explicitly stating what it should \naccomplish.  Further, youth were found to have easy access to the process based on a \nmonthly average of 647 grievances filed. \nYouth also were found to have a “fair” understanding of the process and while \ntimeliness in response has improved, required timelines are not being met. \nThe internal Report noted that most DYS responses are “fair” with a “significant \npercentage” granted.  I found no definition or criteria for “fair” or specific numbers \nsupportive of “significant” favorable results for youth. \nAccess to the process measured primarily by the number of grievances filed is \nmisleading.  Indeed, during our site visit investigations we found that numerous \ngrievances could be indicative of JCO’s, or even Unit Managers, telling a youth to file a \ngrievance instead of resolving an individual, early fixed problem.   \n“These shoes don’t fit and my feet hurt bad!”  “So? Go file a grievance.” \nOne cannot begin to evaluate a grievance system without some agreement on the \nmission, the essential objectives of the process.  I strongly suspect that there is no shared \nunderstanding, or clearly articulated statement, of such mission. \nThis is not unique to DYS and it is a problem endemic to adult and juvenile \ncorrections.  One might ask, for example, if the grievance system is viewed as an \nalternative to litigation?  As essentially an informal local mechanism to quickly resolve \nindividual concerns?  As essentially concerned with identifying and broadly resolving \nmore systemic issues and, thus, closely related to the Q.A. process?  As primarily a \n“venting” mechanism more important for the filing of a complaint than its resolution. \n  185\n\nI’m certain these are other possible objective but the one’s just listed are quite \nrepresentative.  What also seems rather certain is that DYS itself has not arrived at a clear \ndecision and what the grievance process should accomplish. \nWithout pretending to have done a broad, representative sampling, the youth we \nspoke to about grievances had little or no confidence in the process.  Questions about its \nefficacy were more often greeted with amusement than support. \nThe recent CIIC Report56 notes that any youth wishing to file a grievance may \nreceive the assistance of any staff person.  An attorney may help the youth prepare a \ngrievance form but may not write on the form, may not request its processing, and may \nnot process the form. \nViolation of such rules may result in the suspension of the offending attorney’s \nvisiting rights.  While I understand the desire to avoid creating an adversary process, it is \ndifficult to understand the hostility directed to lawyers who might help an illiterate youth \nprepare a grievance.  This type of help is a far cry from a spirited defense or prosecution. \nThere appears to be a functional breakdown in the grievance process at the \nthreshold: large numbers of these youth are operating at an extremely low level of \nliteracy.  Without help in preparing a grievance, the youths’ cause for concern and desire \nfor relief may simply be unintelligible or not presented in a fashion favorable to the \nyouth.  And yet there is no mandated assistance and serious threats of sanction directed at \nlawyers. \nCuriously, the internal “Popel Report” of September 6, 2007 complains about \ngrammatical and spelling errors by staff and the use of “shortcuts” (“ua” instead of Unit \nManager).  I found no reference there to the difficulty youth likely have in framing a \ngrievance and asking for relief. \nAt a minimum, if the grievance system is to work, the youth should have a right to \nassistance on the preparation of a grievance.  For youth who are unable to orally pursue \ntheir grievance there also should be help available.  A simple expedient would be to \ncreate a list of employees from which a youth may select an “adjuvant” for help in \npreparing a grievance. \n                                                 \n56 Correctional Institution Inspection Committee Report (CIIC): Evaluation of the Department of Youth \nServices Grievance Procedures, p. 80 (Aug. 16, 2006)(Hereafter CIIC Report). \n  186\n\nWith criteria to be developed to establish need, that same staff list could be used \nfor the additional aid needed by those youth who lack the capacity or communicative sills \nto orally present and perhaps speak persuasively on behalf of the grievance. \nThis same assistance, in turn, could apply to the appeal process. \nNo staff member should be allowed to participate in such an assistance program \nwithout having taken specialized training on just how to provide this assistance. \nIn my discussion with Mr. Thomas I suggested that grievants obviously seek a \nremedy consonant with their grievance.  However, there are some studies, at least in the \nadult system, suggesting that “winning” is not the only measure of satisfaction; a belief \nthat one was treated fairly may be equally important. \nIn the same vein, there are three areas of decision-making that most directly \nimpact youth in the custody of DYS and where there is a feeling of helplessness as to the \ndecision-making: grievances, discipline and classification/placement/release decisions.  \nThe perceived unfairness of these areas contribute to the youths’ cynicism and very likely \nmay serve as a needless obstacle to achieving positive change. \nIn the current DYS system, the role of the institutional coordinator needs to be \nrevisited and very likely revised.  See Policy No. 304.03, Section D for functions of the \ngrievance coordinator.  If an informal resolution is not obtained then the grievance \ncoordinator appears to be the central figure in any resolution.  Yet, the coordinator has no \nspecial training and no clearly defined role.  The coordinator may be a Deputy in one \nfacility and an executive secretary in another. \nI was told that “people who are good with data get dumped on” to do this job.  \nThis relates to the Activity Management System (AMS) now in place to document \nincidents and grievances within DYS.  The grievance coordinator (or Site Manager’s \ndesignee) is to document in the AMS and this may be a case where documentation \nrequirements overwhelm substantive and procedure needs. \nWhen I asked Mr. Thomas how he would describe the role of the coordinator he \nsaid it was to serve as a conduit and not a problem solver.  Who then regularly solves \ngrievances nee problems remains unclear to this writer.  What is clear, however, is that if \nthe DYS grievance system is to function efficiently and fairly the process must be easily \n  187\n\naccessible, youth should have a right to assistance, and the norm should be to resolve \nissues at the local level as expeditiously and fairly as possible. \nAn adversary model is not needed and, indeed, may be a negative element.  That \nis, there need not be a zero-sum-winner and loser game here.  The objective should be to \nachieve some measure of satisfaction and a sense of fairness with the youth. \nData collection and analysis should, inter alia, be aimed at detecting grievance \ntrends suggestive of systemic concerns requiring system-wide action. \nThe CIIC Report at page 18 recorded a number of problem areas: Only 60% of \nthe grievances were recorded as completed; 60% of grievances at Indian River and 85% \nat Mohican had no response recorded; Mohican granted no grievances, Indian River \ngranted 5%, and Circleville granted only 4%.  Cuyahoga Hills, on the other hand, granted \n42%. \nIt is difficult to interpret these wildly disparate results.  It would be a mistake to \nconclude, for example, that Circleville is an oppressive and unfair facility while \nCuyahoga Hills is wonderfully youth-oriented.  Our site visits belay that impression. \nMore likely, these results speak to what is grieved and how the process is \nconducted and not the climate of the facility. \nOver a four-month period only 69 grievances were reported on the use of force; \nthat is, about 3.82%.  Our interview and record data studies suggests that staff use of \nforce is among the most common problem experienced and yet of 464 grievances about \nstaff in the period studied only 69 were designated as use of force. 57\nThe “no response” problem obviously is a serious one.  The CIIC Report notes:  \n \nGRIEVANCES WITH NO RECORDEDGRIEVANCE \nCOORDINATOR ACTION \nThe lack of response to juvenile grievances is a major problem currently \nfaced by the DYS system. Several institutions (Cuyahoga Hills JCF, \nCircleville JCF, Ohio River Valley JCF) appear to be very good at \nrecording at least some action taken by the Grievance Coordinator in \n                                                 \n57 Complaints about staff amounted to 25.7% of all grievances for the period, twice as many as the next \ncategory.  CIICR Report, p. 23. \n  188\n\nresponse to the grievance. Other institutions, particularly Indian River JCF \nand Mohican JCF, report many extremely serious grievances with no \nrecorded response or action taken by the Grievance Coordinator. This \ncauses great concern, as all grievances should be answered, most \nespecially those that are serious. \nThe following is just a sample of the grievances from January 2006 that \nrecorded no response or action taken by the Grievance Coordinator. A full \nlisting of all grievances from January 2006 that did not record any \nresponse/action can be found at the end of this report. (Note: Grievances \nhave been edited for grammar, spelling, and confidentiality. All notes \nmade within the text are of the Grievance Coordinator.) \nOne serious area to highlight is the high number of medical grievances \nwith no recorded response at Marion JCF. The Grievance Coordinator \neven notes that he or she cannot understand what the youth is writing, but \nthere is no recorded action or response. Face to face interviews should be \nimperative in such instances. \nIndian River JCF \n•  The teacher … keeps provoking me to get into trouble.

There is simply no way that a person without \ntraining and education in the clinical area of complaint can satisfactorily resolve a \ngrievance concerning diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis. \nFailure to obtain a pass, delayed receipt of medically required shoes, even delay n \nreceiving, for example, Motrin can be resolved without clinical input.  However, where \nthe complaint involves receipt of the wrong medication, a challenged diagnosis, or the \nwrong medical  procedure, DYS should consider a process whereby an independent \nclinician in the appropriate field reviews the grievance, interviews the challenged \nclinician, studies the records, and resolves the problem with ameliorative action. \n  191\n\nThere would, of course, have to be further study of this proposal and rule making \non point.  However, if one objective here is to reduce pain and suffering and limit liability \nexposure, then something resembling this process should be considered. \nJ.P. Litigation \nI am, of course, aware of the litigation and Stipulation of Settlement in J.P. v. \nTaft.  J.P. is independent of S.H. but the right of access to the courts, which includes a \nright to legal assistance, is focused on resolving what appears to be the identical issues of \nconditions of confinement as encompassed by S.H. \nAs I understand J.P., the Settlement does not provide counsel for youth to litigate \nagainst DYS.  Sharon Hicks, the J.P. attorney, serves as a conduit to other attorneys.  In \nspeaking with her she noted the difficulty in creating a “stable of lawyers” and even in \npersuading individual lawyers to accept DYS youth cases for litigation. \nMs. Hicks also regularly visits DYS facilities and reportedly finds herself \nadvising youth on grievances, answering questions on sex offender registration, and \ngang-related issues.  In other words, while she is supposed to serve as a conduit to other \ncounsel and to sort out meritorious from non-meritorious cases, she now seems to be less \nconduit and more problem-solver and information provider. \nThe parties might well consider seeking to consolidate J.P. with S.H. particularly \nif there is to be post-settlement monitoring.  Youth who seek damages for harm inflicted \non them obviously would retain the right to individual lawsuits and provision could be \nmade in S.H. for a referral process. \nYouth Advocate \nDon Reyna serves as the Youth Advocate (his professional card adds the title \n“Ombudsman”).  This position has existed for about three years and Mr. Reyna has been \nin the position since its inception. \nIn an interview with this writer on October 16, 2007, Mr. Reyna stated that while \nhe was hired by Geno Natalucci-Persichetti, the job description never was clarified for \nhim.  Indeed, he believes the former Director hired him in response to some [unnamed] \nlawsuit but after being hired he was given practically no direction.  The current job \ndescription reads:  \n  192\n\n60% — Under administrative direction, relives the Deputy Director 5 \n(DD) of the most difficult administrative duties plans, coordinates, \nformulates, and implements the Department of Youth Services’ (DYS) \nYouth Advocate Program & applicable policies and procedures (e.g., \nensures complete access by all youth housed by DYS to all applicable \ngrievance forms, personally assists youth with the completion and tracking \nof paperwork necessary to file grievances; etc.): ensures all facility staff \nmaintain the Grievance Tracking System in order to maintain accurate and \ncomplete record of youth grievances (e.g., logs date grievance filed, nature \nof complaint, parties involved, outcome, etc.); assists DD in defining & \ndeveloping agency strategies regarding the Youth Advocate Program (e.g., \nbenchmarks other State’s juvenile correctional facilities, researches \ncurrent trends related to the detention of youth, etc.); address inquires \nfrom the public regarding the Youth Advocate Program; act on behalf of \n& for the DD in his/her absence for reasons pertaining to the maintenance, \nfunction, or existence of the Youth Advocate Program; requires extensive \ntravel which may involve overnight stays. \n30% — Provides training to incarcerated youth and DYS employees for \nthe Youth Advocate Program (e.g., eligibility, time limits and other related \nlaws, policies and procedures, etc.); ensures proper form development and \nmaintenance and accessibility by all DYS sites; utilize a personal \ncomputer; researches, creates, maintains, and provides initial and ongoing \ntraining for all DYS staff and youth. \n10% — Speak on behalf of the Director & for the Chief of Staff at \ninterdepartmental meetings &/or committees addressing the rights of \nincarcerated youths; act on behalf of Director & give technical advice to \nthe Chief of Staff for special projects/emergency responses. \nMr. Reyna has been a police officer and previously served as a Deputy Warden at \ntwo Ohio prisons.  I found him to be a warm, genuinely concerned individual but placed \nin a position that is almost hopeless. \n  193\n\nI asked about supportive staff and Mr. Reyna indicated for staff, he has a “car and \na cubicle.”  He does consider the facility grievance coordinators as part of “his staff” but \nI took that to be, at best, a metaphor. \nWhat then, does the Youth Advocate actually do?  He is in the field four days a \nweek, trying to be at each facility twice each month.  The week before we spoke, Mr. \nReyna indicated that forty youths at ORV wanted to see him. \nMr. Reyna lives in the Columbus area and returns home each night from a site \nvisit.  ORV is about a 3-hour drive each way and if he works an 8 or 9 hour day that \nmight give him 2 or 3 minutes with each youth if he went non-stop. \nI do not believe I need to complete the thought here. \nMr. Reyna views himself, in some sense as a part of the grievance system.  He \nstates that when he is at a facility the youth call him the grievance man.  He does listen to \nyouth complaints about not getting their clothing back clean, “we wear rags!,” complaints \nabout bed linens, and the like. \nHe uses his knowledge of the personnel and the system to help resolve these \nindividual complaints. Whether he is simply a parallel track to the grievance system or \nmore like an independent agent attempting to solve youths’ problems is unclear to me. \nFinally, Mr. Reyna also prepares Conditions of Confinement Reports for the \nDirector who described him to me as “my eyes and ears” in the facilities. \nA copy of three of such reports are attached at Appendix F. \nThe concept of a youth advocate or Ombudsman is one that deserves a good deal \nof support.  However, with no staff and an uncertain mandate, Mr. Reyna is in an \nuntenable position.  The first order of business should be to clarify the role and as a \nbarometer of the office’s significance, staff it accordingly.  On April 23-23, 2006, a \nconference entitled, “Opening a Closed World” was held at the LBJ School of Public \nAffairs in Austin, Texas. \nSpeakers reviewed the various approaches taken by the Council of Europe (Sylvia \nCasale), the British Prison Inspector (Anne Owers), the Swedish Ombudsman for Penal \nMatters (Cecilia Nordenflt), and the California Inspector General (Matthew Cate).58  \n                                                 \n58 Conference materials are in the possession of Fred Cohen. \n  194\n\nSeveral themes emerged: an Ombudsman must be independent, well funded and staffed, \nand able to bring about change. \nThe resolution of individual problems of inmates and residents is less important to \nthis type of office than the identification of system problems and their solution.  It is the \ndifference between an individual lawsuit seeking damages and a broad-based, class-\naction, conditions lawsuit. \nAt the moment, the Youth Advocate’s office is largely symbolic, but worthy of \nexpansion along with role clarification.  It could well serve as adjunctive to the individual \nproblem-solving of an effective grievance system in pursuit of system problems and \nchange. \nThe Disciplinary Process \nThis writer has studied the various Policies and SOPs governing the DYS \ndisciplinary system and observed several disciplinary hearings.  In Section II, I described \na disciplinary hearing involving a seriously disturbed, 15-year-old accused of creating an \n“institutional hazard;” that is, cutting his arm. \nHe had no one to assist him, he entered a guilty plea with no explanation of the \npotential consequences, and the mental health representative present (I suppose) to help \ndid nothing.  The youth hardly was competent to challenge the charge itself based, as it \nseemed, on a direct manifestation of his illness. \nBased on a request from Deputy Director Monique Marrow, I outlined my \nsuggestions for conducting a disciplinary hearing where the youth is on the mental health \ncaseload or otherwise manifests evidence of a mental disorder. That outline follows: \n1.  No charge should be brought up at a hearing when the hearing officer previously \ndetermines it has no basis in law or fact.  \n2.  You do not ask the youth, \"You don't want assistance, right?\"  Just the opposite \npresumption should apply and with retarded or mentally ill youth, I would always \nassign a trained representative or a youth advocate.  \n3.  Where a youth is on the mental health caseload then the Mental Health \nAssessment form used by DRC is a decent model.  The initial questions relate to \nhearing competency; that is, does the youth understand the charges; is he/she able \n  195\n\nto assist an advocate; (new here) does the youth know what the potential \nconsequences are if found guilty?  \n4.  You cannot assume these youth know what it means for example, to \"create a \ninstitutional hazard.\"  The hearing officer must record the proceeding (it is not \ndone now) and make certain there is a record to support going forward and a \nrecord as to competency and consequences.  \n5.  Treatment team should carefully consider the negative consequences of any \npotential disposition and, turning it around, suggest (when possible) a disposition \nconsistent with the treatment plan.  \n6.  Where a youth begins to deteriorate during a hearing, the hearing officer should \nsuspend the hearing, stating \"why\" for the record and indicate when it might be \ncontinued (e.g., when the attending psychiatrist indicates the youth is sufficiently \nstable to proceed).  \n7.  Finally, the record should reflect the extent to which the youth's illness or \ncondition contributed to the violation that is the subject of the hearing.  This is not \nto create a type of insanity defense but to put the behavior into context.  The more \ntherapeutic the environment, the easier it will be to view harmful conduct as \n\"acting out\" v. \"willfully disobey.\" \nI understand that this is not in policy and procedure or SOP format, but I do \nsuggest it is a reasonable basis for handling discipline involving a mentally disordered \nyouth. \nIn reviewing SOP, 303.01.03 (revised, Sept. 27, 2006), I found the rules to be a \nbit more complicated than need be or perhaps it would be more accurate to say, verbose.  \nSection IV, A (7)(c) should be revisited.  As with the grievance process, staff assistance \nis discretionary, mandatory if the youth so requests. \nI could find nothing explicit on the representative’s role except a suggestion that it \nis evidence gathering.  I think it is worth considering mandatory assignment of staff \nassistance with the role varying depending on what the youth requires.  That would \ninclude evidence gathering, interviewing staff or youth, assisting in understanding the \ncharge, challenging a charge, speaking to the disposition, and the like. \n  196\n\nUnderstanding the consequences of a guilty plea, in turn, would be central and I \nwould anticipate “plea deals” with the tribunal. \nFinally, the prospect of 180 days disciplinary time added to the length of sentence \nand extended terms of isolation are highly dubious sanctions. \nIn my judgment, extending a term of confinement, even though it is, in fact, \nmoving a release date, is a sanction so severe that a facility disciplinary board should not \nhave that authority. \nAny term of “penal isolation” for more than, say, five days is constitutionally \nsuspect and in any settlement of this case, that issue must be clearly resolved. \n  197\n\nXI.  MISCELLANEOUS \n \nLighthouse Youth Center at Paint Creek \nOn October 2, 2007, Team Member Barbara Peterson paid a one-day visit to the \nprivately owned and operated residential center at Paint Creek, outside the village of \nBainbridge, Ohio.  It was originally funded by a grant from the Office of Juvenile Justice \nand Delinquency Prevention to explore the effectiveness of private sector options for a \nstaff-secure residential treatment of serious juvenile offenders. \nBased on Ms. Peterson’s brief visit and assessment Report, Paint Creek appears to \nbe a success worthy of further study and evaluation.  What follows is Ms. Peterson’s brief \nreport: \nThe Lighthouse at Paint Creek is a privately owned and managed \nresidential rehabilitation center for males age 15-18.  Maximum capacity \nis 67. \nThe facility is located on 33 acres in Ross County.  The original buildings, \nit had been a sports camp, were used initially to house youth and \nprograms.  Since 2001 two residential halls, one with 30 beds, the other \n33, have been built.  There are 51 single rooms and 6 that house two \nyouth. \nIn 1998 an eight-room school was constructed.  The original campus had a \ncombination baseball diamond/football field and two tennis courts and \nthose remain today.  The tennis courts are used for “vennis” a combination \ntennis/volleyball game invented by youth.  Three volleyball courts and a \ntrack have been added.  There are plans to replace the current activities \nbuilding with a full size gymnasium.  Due to space limitations in the \ncurrent building the emphasis is on outdoor recreation activities in all but \nthe coldest weather.   \nThe campus is open; there are no fences and no locks on the doors.  \nYouth, except for those in the final phases of programming, are always \nwithin sight of a staff member.  Those nearing release may spend time \ndoing chores off the unit but must report in at regular intervals and must \n  198\n\nattend programming if scheduled.  There has never been a successful \nescape; attempted escapes average one per year for 19 years.         \nAll staff are trained in positive interventions to de-escalate or manage \ndifficult situations.  Over the past three years the average for use of \nphysical restraints is eight times per year.  Since 1986 no youth or staff \nmember has sustained a serious injury as a result of youth to youth, youth \nto staff, or the use of physical restraint. \nThe philosophy of LYC-PC provides the basis of all programming and \ninterventions.  It states:  “We provide interventions that promote positive \nrelationships and responsible lifestyles for juvenile male offenders and \ntheir families”.  The core values of programming are listed as:  positive \nchange occurs only when there is an atmosphere of mutual respect and \npersonal safety; responsible thinking leads to responsible behavior and a \npositive community support system enhances positive changes. \nProgram components include group and individual counseling sessions \nwith the emphasis on group activity.  Each resident has a case manager \nwho helps him with all individual issues including family contact, \ndevelopment of an individual treatment plan, and communicating progress \nto referring courts and DYS. \nThere is a peer-mentoring program and behavior modification and reality \ntherapy are interwoven into all programs.  The center offers chemical \ndependency and sex offender services and mental health support.  \nTreatment never ends at LYC-PC.  Even at meals staff sit at round tables \nand have ‘mealtime’ conversations with youth as they all eat.   \nEducation staff is comprised of 4 academic teachers, one career based \nprogram teacher (CBIP) and one computer instructor.  Boys are able to \nearn 5 credits per year.  Age and the number of high school credits earned \nprior to admission make the GED a better option for most of these youth \nand 74% leave the program with a GED certificate. \nCBIP focuses on job finding and retention skills, consumer math and life \nand social skills.  Youth who are within six months of release can be \n  199\n\nassigned to a workstation on campus.  Each receives a stipend based on his \nefforts at work and school.  Each is eligible for an increase in stipend \nevery eight weeks.   \nEvery resident has computer classes and the level of training is based on \nindividual competency.  Certificates are available for every level of \nachievement and are posted in the classroom.   \nIn 2004 a college class of 12 qualifying students was initiated as a pilot \nprogram.  Due to the success of this trial the program continues. \nThere is one nurse for this facility.  Medications, from individually labeled \nprescription bottles, are self-administered under the supervision of a youth \nworker who notes the medications as taken.  Failure to take a medication \nas ordered is reported to the nurse who follows up with the youth.  She \nsees youth individually and provides education about the medications and \nthe importance of taking it as prescribed.  The need for the nurse to \nintervene is rare.  The expectation is that youth will be responsible with \nmedications and they are.   \nA dentist sees all youth every six months.  Services are provided off \ngrounds.  Youth are also seen by the dentist immediately prior to release to \ncomplete any work and insure dental health at the time of discharge.   \nA family practitioner is available on grounds one day per month.  His \nfamily practice partners also provide immediate and emergency care off \nsite as required.  Youth with a chronic disease such as asthma are seen \nregularly and an interval history is provided for the physician’ visit. \nLaboratory and x-ray services are provided off-site. \nImmunizations are documented and completed as necessary.  The nurse \nprovided basic health education on a number of topics including normal \ngrowth and development and sexual development.  She provides disease \nrelated information on a 1:1 basis. \nThere are two youth workers per housing unit on first and second shifts \nand one on the night shift.  Youth participate in and are responsible for \nmany aspects of programming and unit management.  During visits to \n  200\n\neach housing unit youth were engaged in meaningful activities.  Youth \nearn jobs such as door monitor to remind others of the rules of conduct if \nnecessary.  It was difficult to identify staff initially because they also were \ninvolved with youth in activities.  There was no yelling at any time yet \nthere was always conversation. \nTwo youth conducted my tour of the campus.  They were knowledgeable \nabout all aspects and areas of the program and included all buildings in the \ntour.  One of the former dorms is used for semi-independent living \nquarters for youth awaiting release and who have earned the privilege.  \nThese youth continue in all scheduled programming and unit activities but \nare permitted to sleep independently in one room of the former dorm. \nThere is also a cabin on grounds that has been renovated and is available \nfor families who are visiting.  One of my guides was to be released the \nfollowing Monday and his father would be staying in the cabin overnight.  \nThe Program Director suggested he might be able to stay with his father in \nthe cabin.  She encouraged him to follow up by asking his unit. \nThe size and setting of this facility are unique in DYS as is the relationship \nalthough the youth are not precisely the same as those in all other \nfacilities.  The attitudes of all staff encountered were positive, youth felt \nempowered prepared to sustain the changes they had made.  Youth \ninterviewed individually and as a group had nothing but positive \ncomments about the experience and each also had a plan for the future. \nThere is much to be learned from this facility. \n \n  201",

MARBLEY \nvs. \nHARVEY J. REED, \nDefendant. \nCONSENT ORDER \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nOn May 20, 2008, the Court entered a Stipulation for Injunctive Relief (Doc. 10 8) resolving \nclaims regarding conditions of confinement at facilities housing youth committed to the custody \nof the Ohio Department of Youth Services.  On December 7, 2012, Defendant filed a Motion to \nTerminate the Stipulation.  Doc. 336.  As set out in detail below, the parties hereby agree that the \nDefendant has achieved substantial compliance in many areas covered by the Stipulation and that \nmany of those paragraphs of the Stipulation should be terminated.  The parties further agree that \nas set out in this Order, the Stipulation shall be continued on a very limited basis.  A chart \ndetailing the topics to be terminated, the topics to be monitored only for quality assurance, and \nthe topics for which direct monitoring shall be continued for a limited duration, is attached and . \nincorporated herein.  The parties agree that for the purpose of this Consent Order and to the \nextent it may become necessary to resolve any disagreement, which Stipulation paragraph(s) \nrelate to the topics listed under categories II A and II B and II C of the attached chart (Exhibit 1 \nto the Consent Order) will be determined by Monitor Will Harrell.  Finally, the parties agree that \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 359 Filed: 01/18/13 Page: 2 of 7  PAGEID #: 12268\nthis Consent Order resolves the issues addressed in the Motion by Plaintiff for Specific \nPerformance (Doc. 328) which is hereby withdrawn with prejudice. \nII.  SUBSTANTIVE REMEDIAL MEASURES \nA.  Topics and Stipulation Paragraphs Terminated By this Order \nThe Parties agree that Court enforcement with respect to the listed substantive areas and \nrelated Stipulation paragraphs is hereby terminated because the Defendant has achieved \nsubstantial compliance and/or there is no current and ongoing constitutional violation in these \nareas.  These terminated topics are listed as such at II A on the attached chart. \nB.  Topics and Stipulation Paragraphs Limited to Quality Assurance Monitoring \n1.  Category II B of the attached chart reflects that a number of topics and related \nStipulation paragraphs shall be monitored by the designated subject matter expert to \ndetermine whether the Defendant has effectively implemented a quality assurance \nsystem. The parties have not agreed with respect to whether there are ongoing \nconstitutional violations in these areas but do agree to continue the quality assurance \nmonitoring of these topics.  The Monitor will report on compliance in a timely \nmanner in order to recognize substantial compliance as soon as it is achieved. \n2.  Court Jurisdiction over the topics and related Stipulation Paragraphs listed on the \nchart under II B shall be terminated after:  (1) the Defendant has established and the \nMonitor has approved a program of quality assurance/improvement (as defined in \nStipulation ,-rSW) with respect to that topic; and then (2) the Defendant maintains that \nquality assurance/improvement program in substantial compliance with its terms for a \nperiod of three months.  The Monitor and appropriate subject matter experts shall \nwork closely with Defendant to, within thirty days of the entry of this order, either \n2 \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 359 Filed: 01/18/13 Page: 3 of 7  PAGEID #: 12269\napprove the existing quality assurance I improvement or modify and then approve the \nquality assurance I improvement programs as appropriate.  The burden shall be on the \nDefendant to demonstrate substantial compliance.  Notwithstanding the above, court \njurisdiction over the topics and related Stipulation Paragraphs listed on the chart \nunder II B shall be terminated on May 20, 2013 with prejudice unless Plaintiffs prove \npursuant to the requirements of the PLRA that there is a current and ongoing violation \nof a federal right requiring the Court's continuing jurisdiction ofthis topic. \nC.  Topics and Stipulation Paragraphs With Ongoing Monitoring \n1.  The Parties agree that the substantive area of Mental Health and the related sub \ntopics and the special management units/Progress Units specifically identified at \nII C of the attached chart shall continue to be directly monitored as set forth \nherein by the designated subject matter experts until substantial compliance has \nbeen achieved. \n2.  The provisions set out in II C shall be terminated and the case closed after the \nDefendant has substantially complied with these terms for a period of six months. \nThe parties acknowledge the provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n(P.L.R.A.), 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(l)(A)(ii) making reliefterminable \"1 year after \nthe date the court has entered an order denying termination of prospective relief,\" \nand expect that substantial compliance can be achieved within that timefrarne. \nThe parties expect that direct monitoring will shift to quality assurance \nmonitoring in this area during the last quarter of2013. \n3.  Progress Unit.  Notwithstanding the above terms, the parties agree that the terms \nof the attached Consent Order entered into in USA v. State of Ohio, USDC, SD \n3 \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 359 Filed: 01/18/13 Page: 4 of 7  PAGEID #: 12270\nOH, Case No. 2:08-cv-475 (Doc. 107) (Exhibit 2 to the Consent Order) shall be \nincorporated by reference into this Order and shall apply regardless of the facility \nwhere the Progress Unit may be housed.  The Progress Unit currently has \napproximately 20 youths and clinical staffing that includes three psychologists, \none psychiatrist, one psychiatric nurse, and three social workers.  The clinical \nstaffing may be reasonably adjusted based on fluctuations in the youth population \nand/or based on reasonable professional judgment.  A psychiatrist or psychologist \nor staff member approved by a psychiatrist or psychologist shall facilitate the IDT \nfor the youth on the Progress Unit with attendance and input as appropriate \npursuant to reasonable professional judgment, from social work, psychology, \noccupational therapy, medical, education, recreation, unit management and youth \nspecialists. Effective quality assurance/quality improvement shall be established \nand implemented in the Progress Unit.  Finally, the parties agree that plaintiff \ncounsel will reasonably limit visitation to the youth in the Progress Unit to \nevenings, weekends, or Intersession when possible, so as to not obstruct \nprogramming, education, or the delivery of services.  If due to an emergency \nvisiting is necessary at other times, Plaintiff counsel will discuss the matter with \ndefense counsel and resolve the matter in a way that minimizes any disruption. \nMonitoring of the Progress Unit shall be conducted in the same manner and by the \nsame subject matter experts monitoring the Progress Unit pursuant to the Consent \nOrder in the USA case.  This provision shall be terminated on the same date the \nConsent Order entered into in USA v. State of Ohio, USDC, SD OH, Case No. \n2:08-cv-475 (Doc. 107) terminates unless Defendant has not achieved compliance \n4 \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 359 Filed: 01/18/13 Page: 5 of 7  PAGEID #: 12271\nwith all the provisions included herein. Should the Progress Unit be relocated \nfrom Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility before substantial compliance has been \nachieved, then this order, including all attachments, will remain in place until \nsubstantial compliance is achieved at the new location. \n4.  The burden shall be on the Defendant to demonstrate substantial compliance. \n\"Substantial Compliance\" shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this \nagreement as it has in USA v. State of Ohio. \nIII. MISCELLANEOUS \nA.  Any other remedial topics not listed or not clearly related to a topic under II of this order \nor on the chart or not addressed herein shall be terminated immediately unless Plaintiffs \nprove pursuant to the requirements of the PLRA that there is a current and ongoing \nviolation of a federal right requiring the Court's continuing jurisdiction of this topic. \nB.  The Defendant shall continue to compensate the Monitor and the subject matter experts \nassigned by the monitor to assist with this consent order consistent with the terms of the \nStipulation until this Consent Order is terminated.  The Monitor shall make every effort \nto reduce monitoring fees commensurate with the reduced work anticipated as a result of \nthis consent order. The monitoring team shall consist of no more than the monitor, \nassistant to the monitor, and seven subject matter experts. \nC.  The Defendant shall continue to pay Plaintiffs' counsel fees and costs consistent with the \nterms of the Stipulation until the Stipulation is terminated. The fees for 2012 will not \nexceed the fees paid for services in 2011. \nD.  The Parties agree that this Consent Order complies in all respects with the requirements \nof 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(l)(A), and that the record in this case may serve as the factual and \n5 \n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK Doc #: 359 Filed: 01/18/13 Page: 6 of 7  PAGEID #: 12272\nlegal basis for a Court order issued pursuant those requirements. Based on the record \nbefore it, the Court finds that the prospective relief provided by this Consent Order is \nnarrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the constitutional violations \nand is the least intrusive means of doing so.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce \nthis Consent Order's terms and shall have the power to enforce the Consent Order \nthrough specific performance and all other remedies permitted by law.  The parties agree, \nhowever, that any dispute shall first be submitted to the Monitor for a ruling and may \nonly be appealed pursuant to FRCP 53.  Accordingly, the parties further agree that \nDefendant's Motion to Terminate the Stipulation (Doc. 336) is hereby resolved. \nIT IS SO ORDERED \nDATE:  January 18,2013 \nStipulated and Agreed: \ns/ Alphonse A.

This Stipulated Judgment is entered into by the parties to resolve all of the claims \nmade in this action and seeks to build on initiatives already commenced by Ohio \nGovernor Ted Strickland and Ohio Department of Youth Services (“DYS”) \nDirector Thomas Stickrath to fundamentally improve the care and treatment of \nyouth in DYS custody.  In this case, the Plaintiffs S.H., a minor child by and \nthrough her next friend Brenda Woods; D.J, a minor child by and through her next \nfriend Vera Johnson, and B.F., a minor child, by and through his next friend Rod \nFuller, bring a number of claims on behalf of the class of all youth who are or will \nbe in the custody of and under the supervision of DYS, relating to their care and \ntreatment by Defendant, Thomas Stickrath, Director of DYS. \n2.  This action was filed by Plaintiffs on December 20, 2004.  Plaintiffs allege a \nsystem-wide failure regarding conditions of confinement within facilities operated \nby DYS that endanger Plaintiffs’ physical health and safety; threaten Plaintiffs’ \n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 2 of 90\nemotional and psychological well-being; deprive Plaintiffs of adequate \nprogramming, education, medical and mental health care, and dental care; and \ndeprive Plaintiffs of due process of law.    On July 9, 2007, the court entered an \norder certifying this case as a class action and naming Alphonse A. Gerhardstein, \nKimberly Brooks Tandy, Jennifer M. Kinsley, Maria Ramiu, and David Singleton \nas class counsel.  The class is defined as: \nAll persons who are or who will be committed to the legal custody of the \nDepartment of Youth Services (DYS) and housed in one of its eight facilities at \nCircleville Juvenile Correctional Facility, Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile Correctional \nFacility, Freedom Center, Indian River Juvenile Correctional Facility, Marion \nJuvenile Correctional Facility, Mohican Juvenile Correctional Facility, Ohio \nRiver Valley Correctional Facility, Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility, or \nhoused in Lighthouse Youth Center, Paint Creek, a private facility. \n \n(Order 7/09/07, Doc. 67) \n3.  On May 18, 2007, the Court approved a case management plan under which the \nparties agreed to a joint fact finding team.  The fact finding team was headed by \nFred Cohen, Esq., and it proceeded with a thorough, independent, neutral \nexamination of the facts related to the duration and conditions of confinement at \nfacilities operated by DYS, including but not limited to excessive use of force; \narbitrary and excessive use of isolation and seclusion; arbitrary and excessive \ndiscipline; abusive violation of privacy; inadequate mental health care; inadequate \nhealth care; inadequate educational services; inadequate programming; failure to \nadequately train and supervise staff; failure to protect from harm; failure to provide \nan adequate grievance process; and failure to provide equal access to placement and \nservices for females.  The Team filed its report with the court in a timely fashion on \nDecember 31, 2007.  (Cohen Report).  The parties agree with the Report’s major \nfindings concerning use of force, use of seclusion, and provision of medical, mental \n2 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 3 of 90\nhealth, and education services.  The Report, which is hereby incorporated, \nestablishes that the conditions of confinement for the members of the class fall \nbelow the constitutional and statutory standards in all categories addressed by the \nFact Finding Team.  The Report served as the basis for the extensive, informal \nnegotiations that followed. \n4.  By entering into this Stipulation, the Defendants do not waive, and are not \nauthorized to waive, the sovereign immunity of the State of Ohio, or the State's \nimmunity from suit guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment. \n5.  The parties have conducted extensive informal negotiations since the filing of the \nFact Finding Report.  These negotiations have included the parties as well as legal \nand medical experts in juvenile treatment and care.  These negotiations have been \nundertaken in good faith and at arm’s length allowing the parties to reach agreement \non the procedures and substantive criteria the parties will follow for ensuring the \ndelivery of constitutionally and legally adequate services.  The parties freely and \nvoluntarily, and with the advice of counsel, enter into this Stipulated Judgment for \nthat purpose. \n6.  The Defendants agree to use their best efforts to obtain the necessary funding to \nimprove the juvenile system and to otherwise comply with the standards of care \nincluded in this Stipulation. \n7.  This Stipulation is narrowly drawn to meet the applicable constitutional and \nstatutory standards and the following terms and conditions are to serve as the basis \nfor the injunctive relief encompassed herein. \n3 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 4 of 90\nII.

Comprehensive Continuum of Care in a Regionalized Services Delivery \nSystem.  DYS shall develop a continuum-of-care system that emphasizes \nprevention, intervention and treatment in local communities using evidenced-\nbased or promising practices based on evidence programming, academic and \ntherapeutic based residential care, and a strong system of aftercare to assist \nyouth with successful re-entry after incarceration.  A regional service delivery \nsystem should be created that supports the use of small (12-48 bed) \ncommunity-based facilities in order to keep appropriate juveniles as close to \nhome as possible, and make use of community services.  DYS shall reduce the \npopulation of the current facilities in accordance with a plan and schedule to be \nprepared by DYS in consultation with plaintiffs.  The goal regarding the \nexisting facilities shall be that no living unit in any DYS facility shall house a \npopulation that exceeds that unit’s rated capacity.  The goal of the regional \nplan is to expand regional beds while downsizing or closing existing facilities.  \nThe following factors shall be addressed by the parties in the development of a \nplan to achieve these goals: \na.  The impact of beds to be added by the opening of regional facilities;  \nb.  The impact and implementation of the uniform risk assessment tool \nthat is expected to be in use by Ohio Juvenile Judges in 2009; \nc.  DYS agrees to provide population numbers to the Monitor at intervals \ndetermined by the parties, including the Monitor.  If upon review of the \npopulation numbers the Monitor determines that notification to the \nparties is warranted, said notification will be the sole responsibility of \n1 0\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 11 of 90\nthe Monitor. \nd.  Regular communication with the juvenile judges and other stakeholders \nregarding the limitations on state resources and the need to be efficient \nwith said resources; \ne.  Ongoing assessment of the plan on public safety; \nf.  Ongoing assessment of the plan on local detention facilities, CCFs, and \nother community facilities and programs; \ng.  Ongoing review of the Reclaim formula in order to facilitate the \nachievement of the goals; \nh.  Implementation of the commitment to plan for re-entry with each \nyouth; from the moment he/she enters DYS custody; \ni.  Impact of any changes in method of determining release from custody; \nj.  Impact of the security classification of all of the youth.  \nk.  Whether, on agreement of the parties, based on appropriate juvenile \ncorrectional reasons, the goal with respect to a particular living unit \nshould be modified; provided, however, that no modification would \npresent a threat to security or delay the delivery of services to any \nyouth. \n14. Task Force.  In order to assist the parties to accomplish the regional service \ndelivery goal and the goal of reducing institutional population set out in \nparagraph 13, above, the existing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Task \nForce of stakeholder representatives will continue its work of developing and \nopening small (12-48 bed) regional facilities to serve youth committed to DYS \n1 1\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 12 of 90\nthat are appropriate for placement in regional facilities.  The appropriate task \nforce subcommittee will continue to explore the extent to which existing \nCommunity Correctional Facilities (CCF) should be addressed in the ultimate \nplan for DYS.  The transition plan shall be completed no later than six months \nafter the effective date of this Stipulation.  The task force, using CBT and other \nconcepts, shall work broadly to establish a plan to retain juvenile offenders in \nthe community when possible; substantially reduce the current reliance on \ninstitutional confinement; and, where appropriate, return those juveniles who \nmust be institutionalized to the community through a series of graduated \nprograms responsive to individual needs. It is anticipated that the parties and \nMonitor or a representative shall participate in the task force.   \n15. Least Restrictive Alternatives.  The DYS continuum of care for youth should \nprovide rehabilitation while protecting the community.  DYS secure facilities \nshould normally be utilized to incarcerate and treat high-risk, serious and \nchronic juvenile offenders.  The least restrictive appropriate alternative should \nalways be preferred in order to decrease the number of youth in secure care, \nincluding community correctional facilities or other residential programs.  This \nprinciple shall be communicated to Ohio’s juvenile judges, who shall be \nencouraged to exercise their discretion consistent with this principle.   \n16. Cost Effective Measures.  The system developed should maximize cost \neffectiveness and the use of taxpayer’s money.  \n17. Equitable Treatment for All Youth.  The continuum of care should promote \nequal and equitable treatment for all youth. DYS must focus on the \n1 2\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 13 of 90\ndisproportionate commitment of youth of color and work to identify and \nreduce disparities.  DYS must also develop programming that is culturally \nsensitive, gender sensitive, and disability-responsive. \n18. Effective and Consistent Admission Assessment and Ongoing \nAssessments.  Placement and treatment decisions must be formed by validated \nrisk and need assessment instruments that are multi-pronged and ongoing to \nrespond to the changing needs of youth; to ensure that youth are placed in the \nleast restrictive environment possible; and to ensure that youth are not \nincarcerated longer than necessary for successful reentry.  \n19. Youth-Focused Care.  The DYS system of care must reflect the individual, \nfamilial, social, educational, developmental and psychological needs of youth \nserved.  DYS shall implement individualized, dynamic treatment planning and \nprogramming informed by principles of adolescent development and facilitated \nthrough active youth involvement. \n20. Quality Treatment Interventions.    DYS shall employ interventions that \nincorporate appropriate professional standards of care to include outcome \nmeasures to support effectiveness. \n21. Engagement of Families.  DYS shall strive to involve family, family \nsurrogate, or other significant adult relationships at all levels in the youth’s \ncare, and maintain ongoing, family-friendly, open communications regarding \nyouth throughout their stay.  DYS’ family-centered philosophy shall include \nyouth offenders who are themselves parents and seek to be a caregiver in their \nchildren’s lives. \n1 3\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 14 of 90\n22. Qualified Work Force Properly Deployed.  Professional and correctional \nstaff must be trained, retained and supervised through effective leadership to \nbe a workforce that is youth-focused and strength-based in its approach.  \nHiring, training and ongoing management of personnel to build adolescent \ndevelopment expertise, cultural competence and a genuine sense of care and \nconcern for the youth is essential.  DYS shall expand and refine the role of \nJCOs beyond their current, nearly exclusive function as custodial staff. DYS \nshall continue to support and shall adequately staff unit management in the \ncurrent facilities. \n23. Education Opportunities.  An education system that provides opportunities \nfor continued educational and/or vocational training is essential.  The \neducation component should be designed with appropriate assessments and \nopportunities to advance students at their own pace, taking into account any \nspecial needs that have been identified.  Educational services must necessarily \nbe balanced with security needs, but nonetheless must comply with all state \nand federal laws and regulations. \n24. Grievance System.  An effective grievance process that is responsive to youth \nneeds and concerns, and which timely investigates complaints and \ncommunicates with youth is essential.  Youth must have ready access to the \ngrievance system without fear of intimidation or reprisal if they use it.  \n25. Access to Advocates/Attorneys.  Youth must have easy access to advocacy \norganizations and attorneys to ensure they are informed about their rights and \ncan exercise their rights.  Youth have a constitutional right to challenge the \n1 4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 15 of 90\nfact, duration or conditions of their confinement, and must have the assistance \nof attorneys to aid them in making legal challenges. Reasonable attorney \naccess shall not be hampered.   \n26. Strong Re-entry Programs.  Re-entry efforts should begin at the time of \nadmission and utilize a wrap-around case management function which includes \nresidential options for youth who cannot return home to their families. \n27. Fair and Effective Release Process.  A system for decision making regarding \nrelease must be based upon accurate and current information regarding a \nyouth’s risk and needs, the due process rights of the youth, timely and ongoing \ncommunication with treatment staff, parents or other responsible adults, and \nmust comply with notifications as required by law.  Release decisions should \nbe fair, consistent, and result in youth that are held no longer than necessary \nfor successful re-entry.  There should be accountability and oversight of \ndecision making regarding release. \n28. Accountability and Monitoring.  A strong system of accountability must be \nput in place through systematic monitoring and evaluation of programs and \ntreatment of juveniles.  \nC.  IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES \n29. In accordance with the findings in the Cohen Report, the parties agree that use \nof force by staff, isolation practices, the absence of acceptable mental health \ncare and other appropriate programming, overcrowding, and the deficiencies in \neducation are such that class members are at risk physically, psychologically, \nand educationally. \n1 5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 16 of 90\n30. All policies and procedures (P & P) in the areas described in paragraph 29 \nshall immediately be subject to review and revision as a joint effort by DYS \nand the Monitor conducted in consultation with the class counsel. \n31.  All personnel, environmental, training, and other necessary changes required \nto implement the revised policy and procedures in the above described areas \nshall be undertaken and completed with all deliberate speed and in accordance \nwith specific schedules submitted by DYS and after consultation with class \ncounsel.  \n32. Plan for Reforming Release: The parties shall work with the Monitor and \nprepare a plan for reforming release standards and procedures.   This plan will \nexplore potential revisions of the release authority statute and/or rules; the \nimpact of sentencing that requires mandatory time for certain crimes; whether \ncourt jurisdiction should extend over each youth throughout commitment, and \nother issues related to release that may seem relevant to the task force.  This \nplan shall be completed within sixty days of the effective date of this \nStipulation.  After the plan is completed those measures within the power of \nDYS to implement shall be promptly implemented.  The parties shall work \ntogether to secure the agreement of other branches of government with respect \nto those measures that require the cooperation of other branches of government \nfor implementation.  While this planning process is underway the stay of the \nlitigation in J.J. v. ODYS, No. 2:07-cv-170 (S.D. Ohio) will continue.  Should \nthe parties reach an impasse regarding release from custody one or both of the \nparties may move to lift the stay and litigate that case.   \n1 6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 17 of 90\nD.  REVIEW OF RECENT CHANGES \n33. Within thirty days of the effective date of this Stipulation, DYS shall submit to \nthe Monitor and serve on class counsel a list and detailed description of all \nchanges or additions made by the agency from May 18, 2007. \n34. Unless it is self-evident or included as part of the text of listed changes or \nadditions, DYS shall include a brief description of the history of the program \nupon request by the Monitor. \nE.  POLICIES & PROCEDURES \n35. All existing Policies and Procedures (P& P) not encompassed by the \nprovisions of Section C will be reviewed and revised as needed.  The policy \nand procedures will be designed to meet or exceed the minimum level of care \nrequired by the relevant statute or constitutional Amendment.  The initial \npolicy and procedures review shall be initiated by DYS officials working with \nthe Monitor, subject to review by class counsel. \n36. The policy and procedures review and revision should be completed within \nnine (9) months of the effective date of this Stipulation.  Upon completion of \nreview and revision, DYS shall begin the process of formal adoption and \nimplementation, and shall modify all post orders, job descriptions and \nperformance evaluation instruments in a manner consistent with the revised \npolicy and procedures.  \n37. Following formal adoption, DYS shall launch a training program designed to \nfamiliarize all relevant personnel, including clinical treatment staff, unit staff \nand JCOs with new policies and procedures.  To the extent possible, training \n1 7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 18 of 90\non the revised policy and procedures shall occur prior to implementation. \n38. Staff training on policy and procedures shall be included in the annual in-\nservice training and shall emphasize those aspects of the policy and procedures \nspecific to staff roles in the facilities.  All DYS training programs shall include \nprovisions for testing those completing the training programs. \n39. Mental Health and Medical policy and procedures shall be general and system-\nwide as well as site-specific.  Site-specific measures are deemed particularly \nimportant at facilities serving a special population (e.g., Scioto girls, facilities \nwith special mental health units). \n40. Site-specific measures may not be inconsistent with the system-wide policy \nand procedures. \n41. Following adoption and implementation of the revised policy and procedures, \nCentral Office will annually review each policy and procedures.  The review \nshall not be pro forma.  Subject to modification within the discretion of the \nMonitor, documentation will identify the participants, basis for the review, and \nthe rationale for each change to be made and for the continuation of existing \nprovisions left without change. \n42. This section requires overall review and revision of policy and procedures and \nsubsequent sections will contain more specific principles or content for \nparticular areas. \nIV.  INTAKE AND CLASSIFICATION \n43. Admissions and Intake: DYS shall develop and implement policies, procedures, \nand practices to establish a consistent, orderly admissions intake system that is \n1 8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 19 of 90\nconducive to gathering necessary information about youth; to disseminating \ninformation to staff providing services and care for youth; and to maintaining youth \nsafety. DYS shall ensure that all staff is attentive to the heightened risk of suicide \non facility intake units.  \n44. Assessment and Screening.  To the extent possible assessments completed at the \nlocal level shall be used to minimize time in the reception center.  DYS shall ensure \nthat trained personnel implement a standardized process for assessments and \nscreenings to capture information in a number of areas  including, but not limited \nto,  positive adaptations to past treatment experiences;  coping mechanisms, \nstrengths and resiliencies; family history;  work experience and career goals; \ncognitive assessment and adaptive functioning/school behavior; and diagnoses \nlinked to functional problems. DYS should continue to consider the inclusion of \nadditional validated assessment instruments.  \n45. Orientation.  The orientation shall clearly set forth the rules youth must follow \nwhile at DYS; explain how to access medical and mental health care and the \ngrievance system; include simple directions for reporting abuse and assuring youth \nof their rights and responsibilities to be protected from retaliation for reporting \nallegations of abuse, and provide information pertinent to the youth's participation \nin DYS programs. The rules for all programs should also be posted conspicuously \nin the living units. \n46. Introductory Handbook: DYS shall revise the Introductory Handbook to reflect \nDYS’ mission.  \n47. Classification and Housing.  Youth shall be housed pursuant to a validated \n1 9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 20 of 90\nsecurity classification system that assures placement in a housing unit appropriate to \nthe treatment and programming needs of the youth and the risks of harm associated \nwith that youth. \nV.  HOUSING UNITS \n48. Unit Staff Central to Service Delivery.  Each youth shall continue to be assigned \nto a specific housing unit.  Units shall be staffed by a unit manager and social \nworker(s).  All services delivered to the youth shall be coordinated through the unit \nmanager.  Reentry planning for the youth shall start as soon as the youth enters the \nunit and continue through release.  Unit staff shall be responsible for \ncommunicating with the family or significant adult and engaging those family or \nfamily surrogate figures in the life of the youth in a meaningful way.  Unit staff \nshall also participate as appropriate in the Interdisciplinary Team and/or \nrehabilitation teams associated with the youth on the unit. \n49. Unit Staffing.  There shall be sufficient staff at the unit level to perform these \nfunctions in a manner that allows timely reports, assessments, meetings and \ninformation sharing regarding each youth.  Ordinarily, no unit social worker should \nhave more than twenty youth on his/her caseload at any one time. \n50. Phones in Units.  The phone system within each unit shall allow adequate low cost \ncontact with family or family surrogates, and significant others via telephone, in \nparticular when distances between a youth’s home and the JCF are great. \n51. Records.  DYS shall establish a policy and procedure requiring that appropriate \nunit staff have access to all records necessary for adequate delivery of services on \nthe unit.   \n2 0\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 21 of 90\nVI. REHABILITATION AND PROGRAMMING \n52. All Youth Entitled to Rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation refers to the process of \ncreating or restoring to the individual socially acceptable behaviors and values, and \nis not dependent on a clinical diagnosis. \n53.  Unified Case Plans.  Every youth in the custody of DYS is entitled to a unified \ncase plan and the staff and physical resources designed to implement such plan. \n54. All Staff Participate in Rehabilitation.  All staff members who have regular \ncontact with youth shall have a defined role in the rehabilitative effort. \n55. Routine Interactions With Youth Designed to Promote Positive Behaviors.  \nDYS shall maintain an environment within each facility that creates a socio-cultural \ncontext that supports social adjustment and the development of pro-social skills.  \nBehavior will be managed through the recognition that adolescents learn from one \nanother as well as adults in authority, via observation, imitation and modeling.  The \nrehabilitation planning for youth shall take into consideration cognitive, behavioral \nand environmental influences.  DYS shall develop behavior management strategies \nthat will support social development and social adjustment of youth.  DYS shall \ndevelop and implement policies, procedures and practices that ensure effective \nresources to assist all staff in the creation of a youth monitoring system that is \nconsistent throughout all facilities.    Behavior intervention methods will be utilized \nas part of the daily activity of youth in a fair, firm, and consistent manner \nthroughout all DYS facilities.  Implementation of adopted methods will encourage \nthe increase of positive behaviors and improved social adjustment and the decrease \nof attention-seeking negative and self-destructive behaviors. \n2 1\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 22 of 90\n56. Structured Programming.  The DYS rehabilitation plan for each youth shall be \nimplemented in the context of a system-wide range of structured rehabilitative \nservices, including an appropriate mix of physical, recreational, or leisure activities, \nduring non-school hours and days (“Structured Programming”). DYS shall develop \nand implement Structured Programming at each facility from the end of the school \nday until youth go to bed, and on weekends. For youth housed in closed room \nenvironments, Structured Programming shall be designed to ensure that youth are \nnot confined in locked rooms except: (a) from after Structured Programming to \nwake-up; (b) as necessary where the youth poses an immediate risk of harm to self \nor others; or (c) following an adequate disciplinary hearing, pursuant to an \nappropriate disciplinary sanction. Structured Programming shall be designed to \nmodify behaviors, provide rehabilitation to the types of youth committed to each \nfacility, address general health and mental health needs, and be coordinated with \nyouth's individual behavioral and treatment plans. DYS shall also ensure that large \nmuscle exercise is available consistently for all youth for a minimum of one hour \ndaily. DYS shall also ensure that youth receive programming activities that are \nrequired for parole eligibility in a timely manner. \n57. Volunteers.  The Rehabilitation program shall continue expanding the use of \nvolunteers. \n58. Special Needs Youth.  DYS shall ensure that youth with special needs (e.g., youth \nwith mental illness, mental retardation, developmental disabilities, or physical \ndisabilities) obtain appropriate care, programming, and group therapy (as \nappropriate), including any accommodations in other programming related to their \n2 2\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 23 of 90\nspecial needs. \n59. Comfort Rooms.  DYS also shall ensure that there is a clearly articulated program \nwith policies and procedures for utilizing any comfort room. \n60. Quality Assurance for Rehabilitation.  DYS shall develop quality assurance \nmechanisms to assess whether the program is implemented correctly and \nconsistently across all settings and to assess the effectiveness of interventions used.  \nDYS shall annually survey facility staff and youth to secure feedback on program \nimplementation. \n61. Rehabilitation Program Development and Staffing.  Within 180 days of the \neffective date of this Stipulation, DYS shall prepare a detailed rehabilitation \nprogram describing the behavior management plan, Structured Programming and all \ncomponents thereof (e.g., structured recreation, weight loss, arts and crafts, etc.) \nand the proposed staffing both in terms of quantity, training and education, and \nallocation.  The rehabilitation program shall be reviewed by the Monitor and class \ncounsel. Staffing for rehabilitation programming and the allocation of such staff \nshall be the subject of a detailed annual review and report by the Monitor, who shall \ninclude any specific recommendations for change. \n62.  Sex Offender Programming.  All youth entering DYS who have been \nadjudicated for a sexually oriented offense shall receive assessments and \ntesting specific to their needs.  Upon completion of the assessment process, \nlicensed professionals shall recommend programming specific to the youth’s \ntreatment needs that is normed for adolescent populations, and reliant upon \nobjective, evidence-based criteria.  A Unified Case Plan as described in \n2 3\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 24 of 90\nparagraph 53 shall be developed in collaboration with the youth, the youth’s \nfamily, licensed professionals and the youth’s Inter/Multi Disciplinary Team \nto identify how the individual needs of the youth shall be met.  DYS shall \ndevelop a sex offender program to be delivered in a hierarchical system of \ncare approach to address the individual needs of the youth and the level of \nthe offense.  All professionals working with the sex offender population \nshall receive annual training specific to their level of intervention with the \nyouth.  Policies, procedures, practices and quality assurance measures shall \nbe created to address program service delivery specific to the sex offender \npopulation. \n63. Sex Offender Programming and Release. DYS shall ensure that release \ndecisions for those who receive Sex Offender programming are consistent \nwith the process employed with other offenders, and properly accommodate \nany special criteria imposed by state or federal law.  Juvenile offender \nregistrants are not required to comply with the residency restriction codified \nin R.C. 2950.034 and DYS shall not enforce a residency restriction against \nsuch juvenile offenders1. \n64. Ordinarily, no youth should have his/her stay at DYS extended because of a \ndelay in providing services at the facility level.  Short extensions may be \nappropriate if a youth is very close to achieving a GED or finishing a \nprogram if completion of that program in the community would cause the \n                                                 \n1 The residency restriction only applies to an offender “who has been convicted of, is convicted \nof, has pleaded guilty to, or pleads guilty to a sexually oriented offense or a child-victim oriented \noffense.”  R.C. 2950.034 (A).  By definition, a juvenile offender registrant “means a person who \nis adjudicated a delinquent child.”  R.C. 2950.01(M) (Emphasis added). \n2 4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 25 of 90\nyouth an undue hardship.  An extension may also be appropriate where \nnecessary to complete a program required by a statute as part of the \ndisposition. \nVII. SAFE ENVIRONMENT: STAFFING, FORCE, CRISIS \n     MANAGEMENT, RESTRAINT, INVESTIGATIONS \n \n65. Generally.  DYS shall, at all times, provide youth in the facilities with safe living \nconditions. As part of this requirement, DYS shall take appropriate measures to \nensure that youth entrusted to DYS shall receive individual care, treatment, and \nrehabilitative services in the least restrictive setting, consistent with the youth's \nneeds, documented security concerns, and generally accepted professional standards \nof care. \n66. JCO Staffing.  Adequate staffing is critical to safety for youth and staff alike.  DYS \nshall ensure maintenance of staff levels permitting staff to supervise youth safely, \nprotect youth from harm, allow youth reasonable access to medical and mental \nhealth services, and provide adequate time for out-of-room activities.  DYS shall \ncomplete its current JCO staffing study and attempt to fill the positions identified in \nthat study within 180 days of the effective date of this Stipulation.  The staffing \nstudy and implementation efforts shall be submitted to Class Counsel for review \nand to the Monitor for evaluation and review upon the effective date of the \nStipulation.  The parties recognize that DYS is attempting to reduce the youth \npopulation by the effective date of this Stipulation.  DYS shall have a period of one \nyear from the effective date of this Stipulation to report on whether the staff hired \npursuant to its JCO staffing study is adequate to meet the goals of this Stipulation.  \nClass Counsel shall review said report and provide input to the Monitor, who shall \n2 5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 26 of 90\ndetermine whether the goal of adequate JCO staffing has been achieved.   \n67. JCO Qualifications.  DYS shall take all reasonable means to employ only \nindividuals fit to work with youth residents as JCOs.  DYS shall conduct an \nappropriate background check, including a criminal record check on all candidates \nfor employment.  \n68. JCO Duties and Training.  JCO duties shall include tutoring, homework \nassistance and other participation in youth programming and activities.  Training \nshall be directed to improving the JCO’s skill development from a strength-based or \npositive perspective.  JCO training must embrace the rehabilitation program and \nphilosophy surrounding services to youth. \n69. Staff Training. DYS shall train all institutional staff in behavior management, de-\nescalation techniques, appropriate communication with youth, and crisis \nintervention before staff may work in direct contact with youth. Training for all \nstaff shall have lesson plans that exist separate from PowerPoint and contain \ntraining objectives, useful participant handouts, and an evaluation experience that \nidentifies participants who have not acquired the basic skill levels through the \ntraining. DYS shall upgrade and expand its training materials, particularly \naudiovisual resources that are juvenile specific.  The Training Department should \nreview the juvenile justice training resources at the University of Illinois at \nSpringfield and at the Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice as models for use at \nDYS.  DYS shall collect feedback and information from each JCF regarding local \ntraining needs for staff.  DYS shall conduct focus groups to evaluate and improve \nOn the Job Training. \n2 6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 27 of 90\n70. Use of Force – Generally – Legal Standard Adopted.  The State shall, at all \ntimes, provide youth in the Facilities with safe living conditions.  As part of this \nrequirement, the State shall take appropriate measures to ensure that youth are \nprotected from abuse and neglect, use of excessive force, undue seclusion, undue \nrestraint, and over familiarization. The State shall develop and implement \ncomprehensive policies, procedures and practices limiting use of force on youth to \nsituations where it is objectively reasonable and necessary.  Staff shall be required \nto adequately and promptly document and report all uses of force. \n71. Guiding Principles for Use of Force Policies.  In developing use of force policies, \nprocedures and training materials, DYS will be guided by the following: \na.  DYS policies, procedures and practices should require use of the least \namount of force appropriate to the risk posed by the youth and that require \nstaff to adequately and promptly document and report all uses of force by \nstaff;  \nb.  force should be limited to situations where the youth is currently \nphysically violent and poses an immediate danger to himself/herself or \nothers; or the youth is affirmatively physically resisting institutional rules; \nor \nc.   the institution has attempted and exhausted a hierarchy of non-physical \nalternatives; \ni.  the attempt to use non-physical alternatives has been documented; \nand \nii.  a supervisor is present and supervising the use of force; \n2 7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 28 of 90\nd.  policies should: \ni.  limit the amount, form, and duration of uses of force to the \nminimum necessary to prevent harm to persons or obtain \ncompliance with institutional rules (where compliance is necessary \nunder the circumstances), and require that all staff implementing \nsuch force be trained appropriately; and \nii.  explicitly state that verbal abuse and physical punishment are \nnever acceptable, and expressly prohibit use of force practices that \nare incompatible with minimum actions necessary to prevent harm \nor obtain compliance with reasonable and proper orders including \nbut not limited to practices such as inappropriate shoving, pushing, \nkicking, or striking youth, or inappropriately holding youth in a \nmanner inconsistent with the techniques formally approved and \ntaught to staff at the facilities; and \ne.  policies should ensure that JCO’s are closely supervised and monitored, \nthat all staff are held accountable for the use of excessive force or abuse \nthrough appropriate disciplinary action, and that all staff persons who are \nmandatory reporters of abuse under Ohio law have reviewed and signed a \nstatement setting forth those obligations. \n72. Gangs.  DYS shall utilize strategies that are appropriate and fair to staff and youth \nalike for management of the problems caused by youth gangs within the facilities. \n73. Video Monitoring.  DYS shall ensure that adequate video camera coverage is \nprovided throughout all facilities, including in sallyports and other isolated areas, to \n2 8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 29 of 90\nenhance necessary monitoring and to avoid the risks of self-harm and other \npotential abuse.   \n74. Crisis Management Generally.  DYS shall ensure that Safety Plans, Special \nManagement Plans (SMPs), isolation and any other procedure designed to decrease \nsevere and/or chronic problem youth behavior, including assaultive and/or \nthreatening behavior, are individualized, strength-based, tied to treatment goals, and \nprovide adequate incentives for changing youth behavior. DYS shall ensure that \nsuch procedures are time limited, with graduated punishments and incentives, and \nare carefully monitored and supported by a representative of the Interdisciplinary \nTeam. \n75. Special Management Plans and Isolation.  DYS shall ensure that SMPs and other \ncomparable procedures for youth will involve a member of the Interdisciplinary \nTeam to signoff in non-mental health units.  DYS shall ensure that such procedures \nfor youth who are on the mental health caseload or who are being followed by \nPsychology, require approval by a psychologist and are reviewed on at least a \nweekly basis. DYS shall ensure that SMPs and other comparable procedures for \nyouth involve a careful assessment of facts beyond the immediate charge or \nviolation.  DYS shall ensure that such procedures are reviewed to determine the \nfrequency and outcomes of any previously-used plans, that the procedures are \ndesigned to meet individual youth needs even when the only consideration is \ndiscipline or correction of a recurring problem behavior, and that the plans offer \nacceptable behaviors or new skill development to resolve problems effectively. \n76. Crisis Management Policies. DYS, with consultation from the Monitor and class \n2 9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 30 of 90\ncounsel, and as part of a plan to revise policies regarding seclusion, isolation and \ncrisis management, will dramatically reduce and eventually close the intensive \nprogramming units as currently operated.  Said plan will be developed within 60 \ndays of the effective date of this Stipulation.  The principles that will guide \ndevelopment of this plan include: \na.  Ensure that any youth placed in restraint beyond one hour is assessed by a \ntrained medical professional, in a documented manner, and is regularly \nmonitored by a JCO trained in the administration of restraint. \nb.  Clearly specify the factors warranting the imposition of each approved form \nof isolation; specify the manner in which isolation shall be imposed, \nsupervised, terminated, and documented; expressly prohibit unapproved \nforms of isolation; and require authorization from the Superintendent (or \nhis/her designee) for isolation beyond three hours. \nc.  Prohibit use of isolation as an immediate punishment or as informal \ndiscipline, and, to the extent possible, use isolation only when less \nrestrictive means of obtaining compliance with programming requirements \nor lawful orders have been properly, but unsuccessfully, attempted. \nd.   If isolation is used for discipline it must be appropriate for the youth, and \nthe youth must receive a due process hearing prior to the imposition of said \ndiscipline.   \ne.  Release youth from cool off promptly after they no longer pose a significant \nrisk of danger to themselves or others, or no longer pose an immediate threat \nof elopement.  \n3 0\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 31 of 90\n77.

The \npolicy shall require that staff use appropriate safeguards against asphyxia when \napplying restraints. Except as necessary for control after an event, the policy shall \nlimit the use of handcuffs and leg restraints for point-to-point movement within \nfacilities.  A restraint device intended to immobilize should be an extraordinary \nevent that is clearly defined, ordered by an appropriate supervisor with clinical \noversight, of very limited duration, and thoroughly documented. \n78. Restraints – Training.  DYS shall require that staff be appropriately trained in \nrestraint techniques before applying restraints, and that such training include the \nrisks of asphyxia associated with prone restraint and prone containment. \n79.

DYS shall ensure that adequate staff, \nspace, and time are provided for the necessary planning, implementation, and \noversight of mental health services. \n87. Mental Health Policies and Procedures.  DYS shall establish adequate policies \nand procedures that meet professional practice standards for every major area of \nmental health governance and service delivery. These guidelines for service \ndelivery shall help to define what services should be provided to which youth. They \nmust be explicitly articulated, internally consistent, and communicated or \ndisseminated to ensure that clinical administration and staff have clear, current, \nworking knowledge of existing policies and procedures, expectations, and \nconsequences for non-compliance.  DYS shall ensure that facility mental health \nprograms (policies, procedures, protocols, staffing, space, etc.), including review \nand approval by the clinical mental health hierarchy through Central Office, shall \npromote informed decision-making and consistent staff expectations and \naccountability.

DYS \nshould consider the availability of career tech offerings as one factor in assigning \neligible youth to particular facilities. \n6 9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 70 of 90\n213. DYS should continue to negotiate with the Ohio Department of Education \n(“ODE”) to obtain waivers or explore alternate sources of funding to address \nconditions that impair student access to career tech programs in the DYS school \nsystem.  The Bureau shall explore other funding opportunities to supplement the \ncurrently available career tech offerings, including funding for aptitude and career \ninterest inventory counseling, even if adult education funding is used and must be \nsupplemented from other monies.  \n214. DYS shall explore collaborative arrangements with public schools or adult \neducation providers to provide satellite career tech programs on DYS school \ncampuses, as well as new career tech options that tap into the service industry and \nnon-traditional careers and possibilities for educational options such as independent \nstudy as a way for graduates or GED completers to meet one or two of the academic \nrequirements for career tech.  Staff should continuously seek collaboration with \nlocal businesses. DYS also shall explore options for transporting selected students \nto existing community career tech or adult education programs. \n215. DYS should ensure that all students, including judicially released students, \nreceive a certificate of hours completed and competencies mastered upon leaving \ncareer tech classes, in order to facilitate the transfer to career tech classes outside of \nDYS.  The Bureau should make all certification tests immediately available to \nstudents eligible to take them. \n216. Site-specific Career & Job Training Requirements: As part of the development \nof the education plan at the reception center, the Bureau should consider options to \nallow males to begin Administrative Office Technology (AOT) classes at William \n7 0\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 71 of 90\nK. Willis High School, which they could continue at their next placement, and \nwhich would bolster enrollment in order to save the class from elimination.  DYS \nshall promptly provide space for additional school programs at Tecumseh High \nSchool at Ohio River Valley Juvenile Correctional Facility.  If there is no other way \nto provide all students with a full school day, DYS should build the new career tech \nbuilding at Tecumseh. \nF.  Educational Programs & Support \n217. DYS should ensure that all classroom space on units be wired for Customized \nStudent Learning System (CSLS). DYS shall provide sufficient professional \ndevelopment to enable teachers to implement CSLS successfully and to prevent the \ndegradation of the system into high-tech worksheets unlikely to improve student \nachievement or behavior.  \n218.

D. on collaborative teaching is required for general and special \neducation teachers, with follow-through to ensure that the precepts of \neffective collaboration are embedded. \nb.  All teachers need P. D. on the writing of Individualized Education Plan \n(“IEP”) goals; on the variety of modifications, special education services \nand supplementary aids and services available to assist in implementing \nIEP goals; and on appropriate progress data collection strategies.  \nTeachers, principals, and appropriate facility staff should receive training \non the purposes of Functional Behavioral Assessments (FBAs) and \nBehavioral Intervention Plans (“BIPs”) and training on how to conduct \nFBAs and write and monitor BIPs, including monitoring strategies.  \nc.  School staff members should receive information on the range of related \nservices available for special education students, with examples of those \n7 4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 75 of 90\nrelated services that might be particularly appropriate for DYS students.  \nIEP team members also must be advised of their obligation to include all \nneeded related services on students’ IEPs, without regard to whether the \nservices are immediately available at the school. \nd.  Facility administrators, psychologists, school administrators and IEP team \nmembers should receive training on change of placement requirements. \ne.  IEP team members should receive P. D. on how to conduct manifestation \ndeterminations.  Because most DYS students’ disabilities are inextricably \nintertwined with their behavior, the P. D. must provide guidance on the \nappropriate factors to consider in conducting manifestation \ndeterminations. \nf.  IEP team members should receive structured P. D. on the importance of \ntransition planning, integration of transition goals with reentry efforts, and \nthe drafting of appropriate transition plans.   \ng.  DYS will require appropriate IEP team membership at IEP team meeting.  \nThe practice of case managers fully drafting IEPs should be abandoned \nand all IEP team members should collaboratively draft IEPs.  \n228. Guidance counselors shall be provided with electronic access to students’ full \nIEPs at all schools, rather than the IEPs-at-a-Glance, in order to facilitate \nappropriate scheduling. IEPs-at-a-Glance will be made electronically available to \nteachers requesting them. \n229. DYS shall provide teachers with a form to assist in progress data monitoring, and \nteachers shall be required to monitor progress toward IEP goals.  Monitoring of IEP \n7 5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 76 of 90\ngoals, as well as effective co-teaching and familiarity with, and teaching to, IEP \ngoals shall be considered in the evaluation process for all teachers. \n230. DYS shall create a method of monitoring the implementation of transition goals \nfor students.  Transition plans should be included on the IEPs-at-a-Glance so that \ngeneral education teachers are made aware of them. All DYS schools shall use \nappropriate placement procedures when moving students to more restrictive \neducational settings for school-related behavior.  Students whose behavior is a \nmanifestation of their disability shall not be excluded from their current school \nsettings without following special education due process procedures.   DYS \nofficials shall monitor change of placement practices to ensure that appropriate \nprocedures are being followed, and that IEP teams are not inappropriately excluding \nstudents for whom the school building is the least restrictive environment and are \nnot using the process to exclude students whose behaviors are manifestations of \ntheir disabilities. \n231.  DYS shall ensure that school psychologists are available to support the learning \nneeds of youth within the Buckeye United School District.  This would include \nconducting behavior, aptitude and achievement evaluations for identification of \nstudent disabilities and the development of individualized education plans, \nFunctional Behavior Assessments (FBA), and Behavior Intervention Plans.   \nXIV. GRIEVANCE SYSTEM AND YOUTH ADVOCATE \n232. Generally.  Within 90 days of the effective date of this Stipulation, DYS shall \nimplement a grievance system that has been reviewed by class counsel and the \nMonitor.

The grievance system shall be easily accessible to youth, shall \nensure the right to meaningful assistance for youth in preparing and appealing \ngrievances, and should empower those staff involved in the system to resolve issues \nat the local level as expeditiously as possible.  Youth shall easily be able to obtain \ngrievance forms without staff involvement.  The objective of the grievance system \nshall be to achieve, among the youth who participate, a reasonable level of \nsatisfaction and a sense of fair treatment.  DYS shall establish grievance response \ndeadlines, provide staffing sufficient to meet those deadlines, and enforce the \nresponse deadlines.  DYS shall collect appropriate grievance data, which shall be \nanalyzed on a regular basis to determine problem trends.

Neutral fact finders shall \npreside at the hearing.  \n237. Disciplinary Dispositions.  The disciplinary system shall include a range of \nconsequences consistent with the treatment goals of the youth.  Within 90 days of \nthe effective date of the Agreement DYS in consultation with the plaintiffs and the \nMonitor will develop expanded disciplinary dispositions to be utilized with youth \nconvicted of institutional violations.  Disciplinary time shall not be added to the \nyouth’s DYS stay or sentence by the hearing panel.  As part of the effort to expand \ndisciplinary dispositions the parties will determine whether to allow hearing panels \nto make a recommendation on whether disciplinary time should be added to a \nyouth’s DYS stay.  This shall be done in conjunction with the plan for reforming \nrelease.  Isolation as a disciplinary measure shall only be utilized in accordance \nwith the plan to be developed pursuant to paragraph 76. \n238. Discipline of Youth on Mental Health Caseload.  When a youth is on the \nmental health caseload, the Institutional Disciplinary Committee (IDC) Capacity \n7 8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 79 of 90\nReview form shall be used to determine hearing capacity, i.e., whether the youth \nunderstands the charges, is able to assist an advocate, and understands the potential \nconsequences of a finding of guilt.  The record of the proceeding shall include any \nfacts as to capacity and awareness of consequences.  The treatment team should \ncarefully consider the negative consequences of any potential disposition, and \nsuggest a disposition when possible consistent with the treatment plan.  When a \nyouth begins to deteriorate during a hearing, the hearing officer shall suspend the \nhearing, noting the reason why, and indicating when it might be continued (i.e when \nthe appropriate clinician determines that the youth is sufficiently stable to proceed).  \nThe hearing will be recorded.  The record should reflect the extent to which the \nyouth’s illness or condition contributed to the violation that is the subject of the \nhearing in order to put the behavior in context. \nXVI. DOCUMENTATION AND DATA ACCESS \n239. Generally.  Within 180 days of the effective date of this Stipulation, DYS shall \nimplement a documentation and data access system that has been reviewed by class \ncounsel and the Monitor.

The annual comprehensive report shall include data on population \ndemographics, length of stay, discipline, use of force, isolation, programming, \neducation, medical and mental health care, hospitalization rates, inmate complaints, \nand other indicia of quality of care. \n252. The Monitor shall include in his review a longitudinal study of randomly selected \nyouth who shall be followed from commitment through reentry to the community as \none tool to use in assessing the impact of this Stipulation.  \n253. In the event that Fred Cohen is unable or unwilling to serve as the Monitor, the \nparties shall each nominate two candidates as a Monitor and, with or without the \nparties’ agreement, the Court will appoint another Monitor from those persons \nnominated.  If the Court does not find any of the nominated persons to be \nacceptable, the Court shall ask the parties for additional nominations. \n254. The Monitor shall not be subject to dismissal except upon good cause and the \nagreement of both parties or by the Court upon motion of one of the parties and a \nshowing of good cause. \n255. The person serving as Monitor in this Agreement shall also serve as Monitor \nshould there be an agreement between the United States of America and the State of \nOhio resolving the findings by the United States Department of Justice regarding \n8 4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 85 of 90\nthe conditions of confinement at Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility and Scioto \nJuvenile Correctional Facility. \nXVIII. DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n256. In the event a dispute arises as to whether Defendants have failed to substantially \ncomply with any term of this Stipulation, counsel for the parties shall proceed as \nfollows:   \na.  Counsel for the parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve any \ndifference that may arise between them over matters of compliance, \nutilizing the Monitor initially in an effort to resolve such dispute. Prior to \nthe initiation of any proceeding to enforce the provisions of this \nStipulation, Plaintiffs’ counsel shall notify Defendants’ counsel in writing \nof any claim that Defendants are in violation of any provision of this \nStipulation.   \nb.  Within thirty (30) business days of the receipt of this notice, counsel for \nPlaintiffs and Defendants shall meet in an attempt to arrive at an amicable \nresolution of the claim. Either party may request the attendance and \ninvolvement of the Monitor at such meeting. If, after twenty (20) business \ndays following such meeting, the matter has not been resolved, \nDefendants’ counsel and the Monitor shall be so informed by Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel, in writing, and Plaintiffs may then have due recourse to any \nappropriate legal proceeding or agree that the Monitor may render a final \nand binding decision.  The time frames set out in this paragraph will not \nprevent the parties from seeking prompt judicial relief in the event of an \n8 5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 86 of 90\nemergency posing an immediate systemic threat to the health or safety of \nyouth. \nc.  The parties anticipate that there will be a consent decree in the case \nof USA v. Strickland, USDC SD OH 2:08-cv-00475-ALM-MRA.  The terms of \nthat decree will require that the DOJ consult with class counsel in this case and \nthat DOJ and Class Counsel jointly utilize this dispute resolution process with \nrespect to any claim by the DOJ that the defendant has failed to substantially \ncomply with any term of the decree in USA v. Strickland, USDC SD OH 2:08-cv-\n00475-ALM-MRA. \n257. Any complaints by youth objecting to any conditions of confinement \nencompassed by this Stipulation shall be addressed through DYS grievance \nprocedures.  Exhaustion of such institutional grievance procedures through appeal \nto the Chief Inspector shall be a condition precedent to any legal action by a youth. \nDuring the pendency of this Stipulation, copies of any such complaints resulting in \ndecisions by the Chief Inspector and related documents shall be provided to the \nMonitor as requested. \n258. No legal action seeking equitable relief relating to the issues resolved herein, \nincluding a motion to enforce the terms of this Stipulation, shall be filed on behalf \nof the Plaintiff class or by a member of the Plaintiff class without first resorting to \nthe dispute resolution mechanisms set out in this Stipulation, i.e., advising the \nDefendants of the issue and making a good faith effort to resolve said issue \nextrajudicially. \n259. The Plaintiffs shall not seek an order of contempt unless and until (1) the \n8 6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 87 of 90\nPlaintiffs have sought to enforce this Stipulation by filing an appropriate motion \nwith the Court and (2) the Court has issued a clear and unambiguous order of \nspecific performance to the Defendants.    \nXIX. COMPLIANCE AND TERMINATION \n260. The parties agree that a five (5) year period is presumptively required to retain, \ntrain and oversee the additional staff and implement the terms agreed upon in this \nStipulation.  The parties acknowledge the provision of the Prison Litigation Reform \nAct ( P.L.R.A.), 18 U.S.C.A. § 3626 (F)(b)(1), making prospective relief terminable \ntwo (2) years after a court has approved such prospective relief and fully expect that \nthe status of reforms and timetable for actions under this Stipulation will require \ncontinued jurisdiction of the court for the entire period set out in this Stipulated \nJudgment. \n261. Oversight by the Monitor shall continue for five (5) years following the entry of \nthis Stipulation unless sooner terminated on motion to the Court by the Defendants, \nand a finding is made by the Court following a determination on that issue by the \nMonitor, that substantial compliance has been achieved on all terms and been \nmaintained for a period of two years in all areas. \n262. Notwithstanding the P.L.R.A. or any other law, Defendants may move to \nterminate this Stipulation and dismiss the case on the ground that all of the \ninstitutions subject to this Stipulation have been found to be in substantial \ncompliance for at least two years. \n263. The court shall find that this Stipulation satisfies the requirements of 18 U.S.C.A. \n§ 3626 (a)(1)(A) and shall retain jurisdiction to enforce its terms.  The court shall \n8 7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 88 of 90\nhave the power to enforce the Stipulation through specific performance and all \nother remedies permitted by law.   \nXX. ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS \n264. DYS shall pay Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys fees and costs.  Plaintiffs and \nDefendants shall seek to stipulate the fair and reasonable amount of attorneys’ fees \nand costs as of the fairness hearing in this action.  If a stipulation is not achieved, \nPlaintiffs shall apply to the Court for an award of fees and costs.  In no event shall \nDefendants contest the fact that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party.  Plaintiffs shall \nreceive fair and adequate fees and costs for representation of the class during \nmonitoring of the Stipulation. \nXXI. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS \n265. Youth with Criminal Charges based on Conduct within DYS Facilities.  The \nparties shall work together with the Ohio Attorney General (OAG), local courts and \nlocal law enforcement to expedite disposition of all criminal cases involving DYS \nyouth based on conduct of the youth in DYS facilities.   \n266. In entering this Stipulation, the parties agree and represent that this Stipulation is \nfair, reasonable, and adequate to protect the interests of the class of Ohio juveniles \nincarcerated within DYS facilities and all parties.  \n267. This Stipulation is binding upon the Defendants named in this lawsuit, the \nDefendants' successors in office, employees and agents, and the Plaintiffs. \n268. Except where otherwise provided, the Defendants shall be obligated to perform \ntheir obligations under this Stipulation upon the date of the filing of the Court's \napproval of the Order for Injunctive Relief in this matter. \n8 8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 89 of 90\n269. Only the Plaintiffs named in this Stipulation shall have standing to file a motion \nseeking enforcement of any of the terms and conditions of this Stipulation.   As \nclass representatives, Plaintiffs can adequately represent the interest of the class of \nOhio juveniles in the custody of DYS.  The fact that Plaintiffs have been released \nfrom custody will not interfere with their ability to serve as class representatives.  \nPlaintiffs may replace class representatives from time to time as needed upon notice \nto Defendants and approval of the Court.  This Stipulation does not confer, and is \nnot intended to confer, any rights upon any other party. \n270. This Stipulation in no way waives or otherwise affects, limits, or modifies the \nobligations of youth to comply with the exhaustion requirements of the P.L.R.A., \nany current or future state or federal law governing the rights and obligations of \nincarcerated persons, and the Ohio Administrative Code and other applicable \npolicies, procedures, or regulations. \n271.  The Defendants agree that at the present time they are not aware of any conflict \nbetween this Stipulation and the Laws of the State of Ohio or any presently existing \ncollective bargaining agreements to which the State is a party.  The Defendant DYS \nOfficials further agree that they will not seek any new laws or the execution of new \ncollective bargaining agreements, or any changes or amendments to existing laws or \ncollective bargaining agreements that would undermine the obligations taken in this \nStipulation. \n272. This Stipulation reflects the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes any \nprior written or oral agreements between them.  No extrinsic evidence whatsoever \nmay be introduced in any judicial proceeding to provide the meaning or \n8 9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-ALM-TPK     Document 108      Filed 05/21/2008     Page 90 of 90\nconstruction of this Stipulation. \n273. The language of this Stipulation shall be construed as a whole and in accordance \nwith its fair meaning. \n274. The obligations governed by this Stipulation are severable and, if for any reason \nany part of this Stipulation is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such a \ndetermination shall not affect the remainder. \nIT IS SO STIPULATED AND AGREED \n     s/Algenon L.

The\ncase has been referred to the Magistrate Judge for full disposition\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).  For the following reasons, all the\nmotions will be granted.\nI.\nThis class action lawsuit was initiated by female inmates\nhoused in the Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility (“Scioto”).\nThe named plaintiffs moved for class certification on January 19,\n2005.  That motion was denied without prejudice.  \nOn  July  29,  2005,  the  case  was  stayed  pending  settlement\nnegotiations.    Those  negotiations  were  not  successful.\nConsequently, the named plaintiffs moved to lift the stay and amend\nthe complaint to include in the class all persons who are or will\nbe committed to the legal custody of the Ohio Department of Youth\nServices.  (Joint Notice of filing The Parties’ Proposed Class\nCertification Order (doc. #66), Ex. 2).  The motions to lift the\nstay  and  to  amend  the  class  action  complaint  are  unopposed.\n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM -TPK Doc #: 67  Filed: 07/09/07 Page: 2 of 8  PAGEID #: 318\n(Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Lift Stay and Amend\nComplaint (doc. #60)) and are therefore granted. \nOn June 25, 2007, both the named plaintiffs and the defendants\nfiled  a  “Joint  Notice  of  filing  The  Parties’  Proposed  Class\nCertification Order” (doc. #66), indicating that both parties agree\nthat class certification is appropriate.  The Court interprets this\nnotice to be a renewal of the original class certification motion.\nII. \nAlthough  Rule  23(a)  requirements  are  procedural,  not\njurisdictional,  in  nature,  a  party  must  satisfy  the  requisite\ncriteria before class certification can be granted.  In order for\nclass  certification  to  be  granted,  the  Court  must  analyze  any\nrequest to certify a class in light of the four factors outlined in\nRule 23.  See, e.g., Equal Opp. Comm. v. Whirlpool, 80 F.R.D. 10,\n14 (N.D.Ind.1978) (citing Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d\n747, 757 (3d Cir.1974))(“The Rule 23 prerequisites are mandatory”);\nCharal v. Andes, 81 F.R.D. 99, 100 (E.D.Pa.1979)(citing Wetzel v.\nLiberty Mutual Ins. Co., 508 F.2d 239, 246 (3d Cir.1975))(“The\nsatisfaction of each of these requirements is mandatory and may not\nbe  waived”).    Put  simply,  parties  cannot  consent  to  Rule  23\ncertification.  Rather, the Court may certify the proposed class\nonly if it concludes, based on the record before the Court, that\nthe four factors stated in Rule 23 are satisfied.\n     Rule 23(a) states:\nOne or more members of a class may sue or be\nsued as representative parties on behalf of\nall only if (1) the class is so numerous that\njoinder of all members is impracticable, (2)\nthere are questions of law or fact common to\nthe class, (3) the claims or defenses of the\nrepresentative  parties  are  typical  of  the\nclaims or defenses of the class, and (4) the\nrepresentative  parties  will  fairly  and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.\nThese  four  requirements  are  known  as  numerosity,  commonality,\n2\n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM -TPK Doc #: 67  Filed: 07/09/07 Page: 3 of 8  PAGEID #: 319\ntypicality, and adequacy of representation.\nA district court is required to conduct a “rigorous analysis”\ninto whether the prerequisites of Rule 23 are satisfied before\ncertifying a class.  General Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161\n(1982).  While a district court has broad discretion on whether to\ncertify a class that determination must be made within the confines\nof  Rule  23.    See  Gulf  Oil  Co.  v.  Bernard,  452  U.S.  89,  100\n(1981)(district court bound by Federal Rules).\nA class is not maintainable as a class action merely because\nit is designated as such in the pleadings.  In re American Medical\nSystems, Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1079 (6th Cir.1996).  Although a\nhearing prior to class certification is not always required, “it\nmay be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before\ncoming to rest on the certification question.”  Id. (citing Falcon,\n457 U.S. at 160).  As the Court of Appeals has stated:\nMere repetition of the language of Rule 23(a)\nis not sufficient.  There must be an adequate\nstatement of the basic facts to indicate that\neach  requirement  of  the  rule  is  fulfilled.\nMaintainability may be determined by the court\non the basis of the pleadings, if sufficient\nfacts  are  set  forth,  but  ordinarily  the\ndetermination  should  be  predicated  on  more\ninformation than the pleadings will provide.\nWeathers  v.  Peters  Realty  Corp.,  499  F.2d  1197,  1200  (6th\nCir.1974)(citation omitted).\nAccording to the amended complaint, which the Court, in this\norder, is granting leave to be filed, the proposed class consists\nof\n[a]ll persons who are or who will be committed\nto  the  legal  custody  of  the  Department  of\nYouth Services (DYS) and housed in one of its\nfacilities  at  Circleville  Juvenile\nCorrectional Facility, Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile\nCorrectional Facility, Freedom Center, Indian\nRiver Juvenile Correctional Facility, Marion\nJuvenile  Correctional  Facility,  Mohican\n3\n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM -TPK Doc #: 67  Filed: 07/09/07 Page: 4 of 8  PAGEID #: 320\nJuvenile  Correctional  Facility,  Ohio  River\nValley Juvenile Correctional Facility, Scioto\nJuvenile Correctional Facility, or housed in\nthe  private  facility  the  Lighthouse  Youth\nCenter,  Paint  Creek  (collectively  the  DYS\nfacilities).\n(Joint Notice of filing The Parties’ Proposed Class Certification\nOrder (doc. #66), Ex. 2).  Because the named plaintiffs did not\nfile  additional  evidence  to  support  their  motion  for  class\ncertification, see Falcon, 457 U.S. at 161 (party seeking the class\ncertification bears the burden of proof), the Court will analyze\nthe amended complaint to see if sufficient facts are set forth to\nallow the Court to certify a class.\nA. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be “so numerous that\njoinder of all members is impracticable.”  There is no strict\nnumerical test for determining the impracticability of joinder.\nAmerican Medical Systems, 75 F.3d at 1079.  Instead, the numerosity\nrequirement varies depending on the specific facts of each case.\nId.  Additionally, when the class size reaches substantial numbers,\nthe  impracticability  requirement  is  usually  satisfied  based  on\nnumbers alone.  Id. (citing 1 Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte,\nNewberg on Class Actions, § 3.05, at 3-26).\nThe amended complaint indicates that as many as 1800 youths\nare confined to a DYS facility on any given day.  This does not\ninclude  any  future  potential  juveniles  who  would  or  could  be\nsubjected to the alleged constitutional violations detailed in the\ncomplaint.  The Court concludes that this number is so large that\njoinder of all juveniles at DYS facilities is impracticable.\nB. Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class” before certification can be granted.  The\ncommonality  test  is  qualitative,  rather  than  quantitative,  in\n4\n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM -TPK Doc #: 67  Filed: 07/09/07 Page: 5 of 8  PAGEID #: 321\nnature, meaning that there needs to be only one single issue common\nto all class members.  Id. at 1080 (citing 1 Newberg on Class\nActions, § 3.10, at 3-50).\nIn  the  instant  case,  the  named  plaintiffs  claim  that  the\nalleged  illegal  policies,  conditions  and  practices  at  DYS\nfacilities in Ohio are consistently applied to all persons housed\nwithin the correctional system.  Because all proposed class members\nare subjected to these systemwide polices, conditions and practices\nwhich  are  alleged  in  the  amended  complaint,  and  which  include\nexcessive use of force, excessive use of isolation and seclusion,\nexcessive  discipline,  violation  of  privacy,  inadequate  medical\ntreatment, inadequate healthcare, inadequate educational services,\ninadequate  programming,  inadequately  trained  prison  personnel,\nfailure to protect from harm and failure to provide an adequate\ngrievance system, the Court concludes that there are questions of\nlaw common to all members of the proposed class and, very likely,\ncommon questions of fact as well.\nC. Typicality\nRule  23(a)(3)  states  that  “claims  or  defenses  of  the\nrepresentative parties [be] typical of the claims or defenses of\nthe class.  The Court of Appeals indicated that\n[t]ypicality determines whether a sufficient\nrelationship exists between the injury to the\nnamed plaintiff and the conduct affecting the\nclass,  so  that  the  court  may  properly\nattribute  a  collective  nature  to  the\nchallenged conduct.  In other words, when such\na relationship is shown, a plaintiff’s injury\narises from or is directly related to a wrong\nto a class, and that wrong includes the wrong\nto the plaintiff.  Thus, a plaintiff’s claim\nis typical if it arises from the same event or\npractice or course of conduct that gives rise\nto the claims of other class members, and if\nhis or her claims are based on the same legal\ntheory.\n5\n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM -TPK Doc #: 67  Filed: 07/09/07 Page: 6 of 8  PAGEID #: 322\n***\nA  necessary  consequence  of  the  typicality\nrequirement  is  that  the  representative’s\ninterests will be aligned with those of the\nrepresented  group,  and  in  pursuing  his  own\nclaims, the named plaintiff will also advance\nthe interests of the class members.\nId. at 1082 (citing 1 Newberg on Class Actions, § 3.13, at 3-75 and\n3-76(footnote omitted)).\nHere,  because  the  named  plaintiffs  are  seeking  systematic\nchanges  to  the  alleged  unconstitutional  and  illegal  policies,\nconditions and practices at DYS, the Court concludes that the named\nplaintiffs’ interests are aligned with those of the proposed class.\nMoreover,  the  named  plaintiffs’  pursuit  of  claims  against  the\ndefendants  advances  the  interests  of  all  the  purported  class\nmembers.\nD. Adequacy of Representation\nRule  23(a)(4)  permits  certification  only  if  “the\nrepresentative  parties  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the\ninterests of the class.  The Court of Appeals annunciated two\ncriteria  in  determining  adequacy  of  representation:  “1)  the\nrepresentative must have common interests with unnamed members of\nthe class, and 2) it must appear that the representatives will\nvigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified\ncounsel.”  Senter v. General Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 525 (6th\nCir.1976).\nThe amended complaint states, in relevant part, that\n[t]he  named  Plaintiffs  will  fairly  and\nadequately  represent  the  interests  of  the\nclass.  These plaintiffs possess the requisite\npersonal interest in the subject matter of the\nlawsuit.    They  are  represented  by  counsel\nexperienced  in  class  action  litigation  on\nbehalf  of  children  involving  conditions  of\nconfinement.    Alphonse  A.  Gerhardstein  is\ncurrently lead class counsel on three pending\n6\n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM -TPK Doc #: 67  Filed: 07/09/07 Page: 7 of 8  PAGEID #: 323\nclass  actions  and  has  previously  served  as\nclass  counsel  on  many  civil  rights  and\ncriminal  justice  class  actions  during  his\nthirty year career.  The Youth Law Center has\nlitigated on behalf of children confined under\nabusive and illegal conditions of confinement\nin federal court in eighteen states over the\npast  twenty-six  years.    The  Children’s  Law\nCenter has extensive litigation experience in\nfederal and state court on behalf of children.\nSimilarly, Jennifer Kinsley and the firm of\nSirkin,  Pinales,  and  Schwartz  LLP  has\nextensive  experiences  in  civil  rights\nlitigation, including class action litigation\nof  [sic]  behalf  of  incarcerated  juveniles.\nFinally, the Ohio Justice & Policy Center has\nalso litigated federal class actions relating\nto conditions of confinement and other civil\nrights issues arising in state institutions.\n(Motion to Lift Stay and Amend Compl. (doc. #46), Ex. 1 at ¶ 19).\nBased on this statement in the amended complaint, the Court\nconcludes that the named plaintiffs have common interests with the\nunnamed  members  of  the  class.    Specifically,  the  named  class\nmembers are recent or current juveniles that have been subjected to\nthe  alleged  unconstitutional  and  illegal  DYS  practices.\nAdditionally, the Court concludes that the named plaintiffs will\nvigorously prosecute the interests of the class because the named\nplaintiffs have a significant interest in eliminating any potential\nillegal and unconstitutional DYS practice that the named plaintiffs\nthemselves may be subjected to on a reoccurring basis.  Finally,\nbased on the experiences of the attorneys representing the class,\nit appears that the class’s legal representation is sufficient.\nE. Rule 23(b)\nRule 23 requires not only that the four prerequisites of Rule\n23(a) be met, but it also requires that Rule 23(b) be satisfied as\nwell.  That rule states, in relevant part:\nAn action may be maintained as a class action\nif the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are\n7\n\nCase: 2:04-cv-01206-ALM -TPK Doc #: 67  Filed: 07/09/07 Page: 8 of 8  PAGEID #: 324\nsatisfied,  and  in  addition  ...  the  party\nopposing the class has acted or refused to act\non grounds generally applicable to the class,\nthereby  making  appropriate  final  injunctive\nrelief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief\nwith respect to the class as a whole.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2).\nBecause the plaintiffs seek solely injunctive relief directed\nto alleged systematic unconstitutional and illegal DYS practices,\nconditions and policies, the Court concludes that Rule 23(b)(2)\ncertification is appropriate.\nIII.\nBased on the foregoing, the unopposed motions to lift stay and\namend  complaint  (doc.  #46)  and  the  unopposed  motion  for  class\ncertification (doc. #6 as renewed by #66) are granted.  The Clerk\nshall detach and file the amended complaint attached to doc. #46.\nFurther,  the  Court  certifies  a  class  in  this  case  under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) which consists of the following:\n[a]ll persons who are or who will be committed to\nthe  legal  custody  of  the  Department  of  Youth\nServices (DYS) and housed in one of its facilities\nat  Circleville  Juvenile  Correctional  Facility,\nCuyahoga  Hills  Juvenile  Correctional  Facility,\nFreedom Center, Indian River Juvenile Correctional\nFacility,  Marion  Juvenile  Correctional  Facility,\nMohican Juvenile Correctional Facility, Ohio River\nValley  Juvenile  Correctional  Facility,  Scioto\nJuvenile Correctional Facility, or housed in the\nprivate facility the Lighthouse Youth Center, Paint\nCreek (collectively the DYS facilities).\n/s/ Terence P.

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT \n  1.  This is a civil rights class action brought by Plaintiffs on behalf of all juveniles \nwho are now or in the future in the custody or under the supervision of the Ohio Department of \nYouth Services ((cid:147)ODYS(cid:148)).  Many of these young people are subject to abusive, inhumane, and \nillegal conditions, policies, and practices.  Defendant is deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs(cid:146) \nconstitutional and legal rights and Defendant(cid:146)s conditions, policies, and practices at ODYS \nfacilities constitute punishment and a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, \npractices, and standards.\n  2.  Plaintiffs bring this action to redress violations by the Defendant, acting under \ncolor of state law, of the civil and constitutional rights of Plaintiffs.  The conditions at ODYS \nfacilities, and the policies and practices of the Defendant, endanger Plaintiffs(cid:146) physical health \nand safety, threaten Plaintiffs(cid:146) emotional and psychological well being, deprive Plaintiffs of \nadequate programming and education, and deprive Plaintiffs of due process of law.\n  3.  Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the Plaintiff class, seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief against Defendant in his official capacity on the grounds that Defendant has \ndeprived Plaintiffs of their rights secured to them by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution, as enforced by 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and relevant provisions of federal \nand state law.\nII. JURISDICTION \n  4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3), this being \nan action to redress the deprivation of rights under color of state law secured by the Constitution \nof the United States, the Civil Rights Act, and 42 U.S.C. §1983. \n2\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 3 of 19\n  5.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(4), this \nbeing an action to secure declaratory and injunctive relief under Acts of Congress providing for \nthe protection of civil rights, specifically the Civil Rights Act.\n  6.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331(a), this \nbeing an action in which the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States.\n  7.  This Court is authorized to grant declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202 and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  8.  This court has supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367 to review \nand decide Plaintiffs(cid:146) state law claims. \nIII. VENUE \n9.  The Southern District of Ohio is an appropriate venue for this action pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) as the acts and events giving rise to the claims herein occurred within the \nboundaries of the Columbus Division of the Southern District of Ohio.\nIV. PARTIES \nA. Plaintiffs \n10.  Each of the named Plaintiffs is a citizen of the United States and is currently \neither incarcerated in an ODYS facility or under parole to ODYS.  Each of the named Plaintiffs \nis personally subjected to Defendant(cid:146)s conditions, policies, and practices, as set forth herein, and \neach of the named Plaintiffs suffers actual injury as a result of those conditions, policies, and \npractices.\n11.  Each of the named Plaintiffs who is a minor sues through his or her Next Friend, \nwho is their parent or other adult citizen of the State of Ohio.\n3\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 4 of 19\n12.  Plaintiff S.W. is a minor female from Dayton, Ohio and was incarcerated at \nScioto Juvenile Correctional Facility as of July 23, 2004.  The conditions, policies, and practices \ndescribed in this complaint to which she has been subjected include verbal abuse by juvenile \ncorrection officers, excessive use of force by juvenile correction officers, failure of the Scioto \nstaff and the chief inspector to respond to her written grievances, and failure to have her claims \nof abuse reported to the Ohio State Highway Patrol.  S.W. has filed grievances regarding these \nissues, including an appeal to the Chief Inspector(cid:146)s office.\n13.  Plaintiff D.J. is a minor female from Cleveland, Ohio and has been incarcerated at \nScioto Juvenile Correctional Facility since March 7 , 2003.  The conditions, policies, and \npractices described in this complaint to which she has been subjected include inappropriate use \nof isolation and excessive use of force by a juvenile correction officer, physical abuse by \njuvenile correction officers, failure to provide adequate dental care, and invasion of privacy.\nD.J. has filed written grievances regarding these issues, including an appeal to the Chief \nInspector.\n14.  Plaintiff B.F. is a 16 year old male from southern Ohio who has been incarcerated \nat various ODYS facilities, including Circleville Juvenile Correctional Facility and Ohio River \nValley Juvenile Correctional Facility.  He is presently housed at Ohio River Valley Correctional \nFacility.  The conditions, policies, and practices described in this complaint to which he has been \nsubjected include excessive use of force by juvenile correction officers, the failure of juvenile \ncorrection officers to protect him from physical and sexual abuse by other juvenile inmates, \ndenial of adequate medical care, denial of adequate mental health programming and treatment, \ndenial of adequate educational services, and denial of an adequate grievance process.\n4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 5 of 19\nB.  Defendant \n15.  Defendant Thomas Stickrath is the director of the Ohio Department of Youth \nServices.  Pursuant to Chapter 121 of the Ohio Revised Code, Defendant Stickrath has full \ncontrol of all juvenile institutions and programs under The Ohio Department of Youth Services(cid:146) \n((cid:147)ODYS(cid:148)) administration. ODYS is an agency of the State of Ohio and, pursuant to Ohio Rev. \nCode § 5130.03, is mandated to control and manage all state institutions or facilities established \nor created for the training or rehabilitation of delinquent children committed to ODYS.  As the \ndirector of ODYS, Defendant Stickrath has been personally and directly involved in decisions to \nestablish and maintain the conditions, policies, and practices described in this complaint.  \nPlaintiffs bring this action against this Defendant in his official capacity. \nV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n16.  The named Plaintiffs, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n(b)(2),  bring this action on behalf of themselves and on behalf of a class of persons defined as:\nAll persons who are now, or in the future, will be held in the custody or under the \nsupervision of ODYS . \n17.  The class of Plaintiffs is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, \nwith as many as 1800 youth confined at facilities operated by ODYS on any given day.  In \naddition, there are questions of law and fact common to the members of the Plaintiff class. These \ninclude the factual circumstances and the legality and constitutionality of the conditions, \npolicies, and practices under which Defendant confines Plaintiffs at ODYS facilities.\n18.  Defendant imposed the conditions, policies, and practices challenged in this \naction on the named Plaintiffs and on the members of the Plaintiff class so that the claims of the \nnamed Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class.  \n5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 6 of 19\n19.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \nThese Plaintiffs possess the requisite personal interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit.  They \nare represented by counsel experienced in class action litigation on behalf of children involving \nconditions of confinement.  Alphonse A. Gerhardstein is currently lead class counsel on three \npending class actions and has previously served as class counsel on many civil rights and \ncriminal justice class actions during his thirty year career.  The Youth Law Center has litigated \non behalf of children confined under abusive and illegal conditions of confinement in federal \ncourt in eighteen states over the past twenty-six years.  The Children(cid:146)s Law Center has extensive \nlitigation experience in federal and state court on behalf of children.  Similarly, Jennifer Kinsley \nand  the firm of Sirkin, Pinales, and Schwartz LLP has extensive experience in civil rights \nlitigation, including class action litigation of behalf of incarcerated juveniles. Finally, the Ohio \nJustice & Policy Center has also litigated federal class actions relating to conditions of \nconfinement and other civil rights issues arising in state institutions.   \n20.  Defendant has acted and continues to act in a manner generally applicable to the \nclass, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief and injunctive relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole.\n21.  The injuries suffered by the named Plaintiffs and the members of the Plaintiff \nclass are capable of repetition, yet may evade review, thereby making class relief appropriate.  \nVI.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Characteristics of the Facilities, System and the Class Population\n22.   ODYS operates several juvenile correctional institutions, including but not \nlimited to Circleville Youth Center, Cuyahoga Hills Boys School, Indian River School, Marion \nJuvenile Correctional Center, Mohican Youth Center, Ohio River Valley Youth Center, Scioto \n6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 7 of 19\nJuvenile Correctional Center, and the Freedom Center. These institutions are state facilities \ncreated by the General Assembly under the management and control of ODYS. \n23.  ODYS Also contracts with a private operator for the management of the Paint \nCreek youth center. After custody, juveniles are often placed on parole for a period to insure \nadjustment during reentry to the community.\n24.   Juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent for committing acts that if committed by \n an adult would constitute felonies may be committed to ODYS for an indefinite period of time \nup to and until the child turns 21. \n25.   Juveniles who have been adjudicated felony delinquents are eligible for \nplacement at juvenile corrections facilities. A felony delinquent is a child at least 12 and less \nthan 18 who has been adjudicated a delinquent child for committing an act that if committed by \nan adult would be a felony offense.  A felony delinquent can also be an adult between the ages of \n18 and 21 who is in the legal custody of ODYS and has committed a felonious act while in \ncustody.\n26.   Juveniles committed to ODYS range in age from 12 to 21. Placement in an \ninstitution or community corrections facility may be from several months for as long as several \nyears. The average age of admission in Ohio is 15.9 years. \n27.  Committed juveniles, by virtue of their age, lack of maturity, and education \nlevels, are often unfamiliar with their legal rights and remedies. In addition, they are often \nunaware of how to obtain access to the courts or challenge the legality of their commitments, \ntheir continued confinement, and institutional practices and conditions that may violate their \ncivil rights. \n7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 8 of 19\nB.  Use of Excessive Force \n  28.  With Defendant’s knowledge, and pursuant to official policy and custom, staff at \nfacilities operated by ODYS use physical force on Plaintiffs when such force is excessive, \nunreasonable, and unnecessary to protect Plaintiffs from injury to themselves or to prevent injury \nto others.\n  29.  Staff uses physical force in such a way to cause physical pain, emotional harm, \nand physical injury to Plaintiffs by hitting, choking, gripping, grabbing, twisting, bending, and \napplying other applications of force on youth when they do not present a danger to themselves or \nothers.  Staff invite and heighten confrontation by approaching youth in an argumentative, \nthreatening, and abusive manner. \n  30.  Staff use mechanical restraints, applying 4-point restraints to youth in isolation \nwhen the youth are fully in control and compliant and do not pose an imminent threat to \nthemselves or others.  \n  31.   In other instances where force may be warranted, ODYS staff unnecessarily \napply excessive amounts of force resulting in physical injury and emotional harm to Plaintiffs. \nC.  Arbitrary and Excessive Use of Isolation and Seclusion \n32.  Defendant regularly places Plaintiffs in lockdown and isolation for arbitrary \nreasons and for grossly excessive periods.  Defendant routinely places Plaintiffs in isolation for \nseveral hours to several days as a disciplinary measure.  Defendant also places Plaintiffs in \nspecial (cid:147)isolation(cid:148) cells, often as an informal disciplinary measure for arbitrary reasons and \nwithout providing due process.  Some ODYS facilities maintain units that are locked down for \n23 hours a day and select youth often spend several months in these units.  \n8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 9 of 19\n33.  As a result of continuing policies and practices, Defendant regularly places \nPlaintiffs in isolation as punishment, for the convenience of staff, or in some instances, instead of \ntherapeutic programming.  Defendant does not have a procedure by which qualified \nprofessionals determine the need for isolation or the amount of time necessary for isolation.  \nDefendant fails to use isolation only for instances where Plaintiffs pose an immediate threat to \nthe health or safety of themselves or others.  Defendant fails to release Plaintiffs from isolation \nwhen they have demonstrated that they are in control of themselves.  Defendant fails to \nadequately monitor Plaintiffs in isolation. Defendant fails to provide adequate education, \ncounseling, recreation, or other rehabilitative treatment to Plaintiffs in isolation.  \n34.  Although Defendant has written policies for procedural due process on discipline, \nin practice Defendant often fails to provide minimum procedural due process protections to \nPlaintiffs accused of violating institutional rules and facing substantial periods of isolation.\n35.  Plaintiffs held in isolation experience extreme loneliness, anxiety, rage, and \ndepression, among other potentially debilitating emotional and psychological problems.  \nDefendant fails to ensure that prolonged use of isolation does not have adverse psychological \nconsequences on isolated youth. As a result of Defendant(cid:146)s continuing policies and practices of \nprolonged isolation, girls suffer from physical injuries, including self inflicted injuries and \nemotional harm.  \nD.  Arbitrary and Excessive Discipline \n36.  Defendant subjects Plaintiffs to an arbitrary and punitive disciplinary system.  \n37.  ODYS staff arbitrarily punish Plaintiffs for behavior such as (cid:147)being \nargumentative,(cid:148) mopping incorrectly, horse-playing with other children, and (cid:147)rapping.(cid:148)  \n9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 10 of 19\n38.  Defendant(cid:146)s arbitrary practices lead to excessive punishment for Plaintiffs, \nincluding increased lockdown and isolation. These practices are especially detrimental for \nPlaintiffs with mental health problems including mental illnesses. Defendant has failed to \nadequately train and supervise staff to respond in appropriate ways to Plaintiffs with mental \nhealth issues.  Excessive and arbitrary isolation are particularly harmful for Plaintiffs with \nmental health issues, and cause the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain on these Plaintiffs.  \n39.  Defendant(cid:146) arbitrary policies and practices also result in additional and extended \nincarceration.\nE.  Abusive Violation of Privacy \n40.  With Defendant(cid:146)s knowledge, and pursuant to official policy and custom, ODYS \nstaff conduct strip searches of youth in their facilities.  This practice is abusive and demeaning to \nPlaintiffs. \nF.  Inadequate Mental Health Care \n41.  Defendant is deliberately indifferent to the serious mental health needs of \nPlaintiffs. A significant number of youth in ODYS have a mental health diagnosis and many of \nthese youth take psychotropic medications. However, other than the provision of crisis \nintervention services and the dispensing of psychotropic medication, Defendant fails to provide \nany regular individualized psychiatric treatment, counseling, or psychotherapy to Plaintiffs in \nneed of such services.\n42.  Defendant fails to provide a continuum of mental health services to meet the \nneeds of Plaintiffs.  Defendant fails to maintain adequate mental health records for Plaintiffs.  \nDefendant fails to employ a sufficient number of qualified mental health professionals to counsel \nand treat Plaintiffs with mental health treatment needs.   Defendant also fails to provide adequate \n10\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 11 of 19\nor effective group counseling by trained staff.  Defendant fails to adequately train and supervise \nstaff to care for youth with mental health needs.  \n43.  As a result of these failures, Plaintiffs do not receive counseling or other \nnecessary mental health treatment, and their mental condition deteriorates. The result is that \nPlaintiffs with mental health treatment needs are incarcerated at ODYS facilities without access \nto adequate mental health care.  \nG.  Inadequate Health Care \n44.  Defendant is deliberately indifferent to the health needs of the Plaintiffs. \nDefendant provides medical assessments to Plaintiffs upon admittance, but fails to provide \ntimely access to qualified health professionals when Plaintiffs are in need of health services - and \nDefendant fails to deliver adequate healthcare services, when those services are provided.\nDefendant also fails to provide a continuity of medical care and adequate documentation for the \ncare that is provided.  Defendant has a history of failing to respond to medical needs in a timely \nand adequate manner.     \n45.  As a result of Defendant(cid:146)s deliberate indifference, Plaintiffs with health care \nneeds do not receive adequate treatment and suffer physical and emotional harm.\nH.  Failure to Provide Access to Adequate Education Services \n46.  Defendant has failed to develop and implement policies and procedures to assure \nthat all Plaintiffs have access to educational services mandated by state and federal law.  \nDefendant(cid:146)s deficiencies include the failure to meet the classroom instructional mandates of state \nlaw, to provide an adequate number of teachers to prevent regular cancellation of classes, to \nprovide access to guidance services necessary to Plaintiffs achievement of educational and career \nplanning goals required as a part of their rehabilitation and treatment, and to provide disabled \n11\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 12 of 19\nstudents with a free and appropriate education, including related and transition services, in \naccordance with the IDEA and state statutory requirements. \n47.   As a result of Defendant(cid:146)s failures, Plaintiffs are denied their right to education, \nare subject to having their incarceration time extended for failure to meet treatment goals, and \nare denied the opportunity to meaningfully participate in the facility(cid:146)s (cid:147)level system(cid:148) and receive \nthe benefits associated therewith.\nI.  Inadequate Programming \n48.  Defendant has failed to provide Plaintiffs with adequate programming.  Defendant \nfails to provide any regular structured indoor or outdoor recreation.  Furthermore, Defendant \nfails to provide access to regular large muscle exercise activities. As a result, Plaintiffs suffer \nfrom extended periods of force idleness.   \nJ.  Failure to Adequately Train and Supervise Staff \n49.  Defendant has failed to adequately train and supervise staff at ODYS facilities for \nthe usual and recurring situations that they face and Plaintiffs are injured as a direct \nconsequence.  The need for more and different staff training is so obvious that Defendant(cid:146)s \nfailure to provide such training amounts to deliberate indifference.  \n50.  As a result of Defendant(cid:146)s failure to adequately train and supervise staff, \nPlaintiffs suffer from physical and emotional harm and fail to receive treatment consistent with \nthe purposes of their confinement. \nK.  Failure to Protect from Harm \n51.  Defendant has endangered Plaintiffs by inadequately training staff for their \ncustody duties, by focusing on the use of force and unreasonable bodily restraints as methods of \ncontrolling Plaintiffs, by inadequately supervising staff, by failing to investigate and abate \n12\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 13 of 19\ndangerous conditions, by failing to develop and follow an effective internal review process for \nreporting policy violations, and by failing to discipline staff appropriately.  Defendant fails to \nprotect youth from injury by staff and other youth. \n  52.  Defendant has failed to employ an adequate classification system for housing unit \nassignments and fail to provide adequate staffing in living areas, thereby endangering the safety \nand security of Plaintiffs.  Staff regularly fail to monitor Plaintiffs who are placed in seclusion, \nfail to monitor and prevent Plaintiffs from engaging in self-mutilation or other self-injurious \nbehavior, and fail to protect vulnerable girls from injury from other residents. \n53.  As a result of Defendant(cid:146)s failure to protect youth confined in ODYS facilities \nfrom harm, Plaintiffs suffer repeated physical and emotional injuries at the hands of staff and \nother youth. \nL.  Failure to Provide Adequate Grievance System \n54.  Defendant has failed to provide meaningful access to and maintain an adequate \ngrievance system. The grievance policies are not clear and the policies are inconsistent with the \ngrievance forms provided to youth.  Grievance forms are not always available and staff interferes \nwith Plaintiffs(cid:146) access to the grievance system through acts of intimidation and retaliation.  \nDefendant does not timely, if at all, respond to grievances and fails to keep adequate records of \ngrievances filed.  Investigations of grievances are inadequate and when responses are provided \nthey rarely are adequately resolved.\n55.  Grievances alleging use of excessive force or other improprieties by staff are \noften left in interminable limbo as they are investigated by the Chief Inspector from ODYS(cid:146) \ncentral office. Investigations completed by the Chief Inspector(cid:146)s Office varied widely in quality \nand accuracy.\n13\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 14 of 19\n56.  Plaintiffs are routinely subjected to retaliation from staff for filing grievances or \nparticipating as a witness in grievances filed by other youth.  Staff retaliate by imposing \nunjustified discipline, denying earned privileges, denying access to services, and threatening and \nintimidating youth.   \nM.  Failure to Provide Equal Access to Placements and Services \n57.  Defendant has failed to provide female Plaintiffs with equal access and services \nprovided to boys committed to the custody of ODYS.  Defendant fails to maintain any \ncommunity correction beds for girls and thus female Plaintiffs are subjected to confinement in \nmore restrictive, more punitive settings than their male counterparts.  \nVII. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES \n  58.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all available administrative remedies for the \ndeprivations complained of herein.  \nVIII. NECESSITY FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;\n  NO ADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW \n59.  Defendant has acted and continues to act in violation of the law as described \nherein. Plaintiffs do not have an adequate remedy at law. As a proximate result of the policies, \npractices, acts, and omissions of Defendant, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer \nserious and irreparable physical, psychological, mental, and emotional injuries. Plaintiffs have \nno plain, adequate, or complete remedy at law to redress the wrongs described herein. Defendant \nhas acted and continue to act in violation of the law, and Plaintiffs will continue to suffer \nirreparable injuries from the conditions of confinement at ODYS facilities and Defendant(cid:146)s \npolicies, practices, acts, and omissions. \n14\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01206-GCS-TPK     Document 46-2     Filed 04/04/2007     Page 15 of 19\nIX.  KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEFENDANT \n60.  The Defendant has acted, and continues to act, under the color of state law with \nrespect to all matters alleged herein.

      "title": "Justice Department Settles Lawsuit Against State of Ohio to End Unlawful Seclusion of Youth in Juvenile Correctional Facilities ",
      "text": "6/17/2014 USDOJ: Justice Department Settles Lawsuit Against State of Ohio to End Unlawful Seclusion of Youth in Juvenile Correctional Facilities\n \nHome   »  Briefing Room   »  Justice News Printer Friendly\nDepartment  of  Justice\nOffice of Public Affairs\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, May 21, 2014\nJustice  Department  Settles  Lawsuit  Against  State  of  Ohio\nto  End  Unlawful  Seclusion  of  Youth  in  Juvenile\nCorrectional  Facilities\nThe United States and private plaintiffs announced today that it has reached an agreement with the state\nof Ohio, under which the State Department of Youth Services (DYS) will dramatically reduce, and\neventually eliminate, its use of seclusion on young people in its custody.  DYS will also ensure that\nyoung people in its juvenile facilities receive individualized mental health treatment to prevent and\naddress the conditions and behaviors that led to seclusion.  The order resolves allegations that the state\nsubjects young people with mental health needs in its custody to harmful seclusion and withholds\ntreatment and programming, in violation of their constitutional rights. \n \n“Overreliance on solitary confinement for young people, particularly those with disabilities, is unsafe\nand counterproductive,” said Attorney General Eric Holder.  “This agreement will help ensure that\nincarceration in Ohio's state facilities is humane and that appropriate treatment is provided for young\npeople with mental illness.  The Justice Department will continue to evaluate the use of solitary\nconfinement so that it does not become a new normal for incarcerated juveniles.”\n           \nThe department first investigated conditions at Ohio juvenile correctional facilities in 2007 and found\nconstitutional deficiencies in the state’s use of physical force, mental health care, grievance\ninvestigation and processing and use of seclusion.  The department entered into a consent decree with\nthe state in June 2008 to remedy these violations at the Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility and the\nsince-closed Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility.  Simultaneously, private plaintiffs in the case S.H.  v.\nReed  entered into a consent decree with the state regarding similar deficiencies at all of the state’s\njuvenile correctional facilities.  However, between November 2013 and January 2014, data from the\nReport a Crime\nmonitoring of both consent decrees revealed that Ohio had continued to use unlawful seclusion on youth\nat Scioto and in the other facilities.  Get a Job\n \nLocate a Prison, Inmate, or Sex Offender\nOn March 12, 2014, the department moved to supplement its original complaint by including the state’s\nuse of unlawful seclusion at all of its juvenile correctional facilities.  The court granted the motion on Apply for a Grant\nMarch 28, 2014, and the department filed the supplemental complaint on March 31, 2014.  The\ndepartment also sought a temporary restraining order requiring immediate measures to curb the state’s Submit a Complaint\nexcessive seclusion of youth with mental health disorders.  The agreed order resolves the United States’ Report Waste, Fraud, Abuse or Misconduct\nclaims in its motion for a temporary restraining order, as well as a motion for specific performance filed to the Inspector General\nby the S.H.  plaintiffs. \nFind Sales of Seized Property\n \nAs an interim measure prior to the elimination of disciplinary seclusion for youth, the state will Find Help and Information for Crime\ndramatically reduce the conditions under which seclusion is allowed and the duration of seclusion.  The Victims\nstate will also reduce the potential harms caused by seclusion by increasing access to therapeutic,\nRegister, Apply for Permits, or Request\neducational and recreational services while a young person is in seclusion.\nRecords\n \nThe order requires the state to implement quality assurance measures to verify mental health treatment Identify Our Most Wanted Fugitives\nintegrity, develop comprehensive assessments of youth, eliminate the use of disciplinary seclusion on\nFind a Form\nyouth with mental health needs, except for the most serious offenses, limit the amount and duration of\ndisciplinary seclusion in the limited circumstances when it is permissible, conduct regular checks on Report and Identify Missing Persons\nyouth who are secluded for safety concerns in order to release youth as soon as possible and perform\nContact Us\nindividualized treatment plan reviews and modifications to address violent behaviors.  The order\nincludes performance standards to measure compliance with these requirements, which will be jointly\noverseen by the monitors in the existing United States and S.H.  consent decrees. \n \nBecause the order also reflects the state’s commitment to eliminate all disciplinary seclusion, the\ndepartment agreed to withdraw its remaining claims regarding the state’s seclusion of youth who do not\nhave an identified mental health disorder.  The department can renew those claims later if the state\nmakes insufficient progress in eliminating all forms of disciplinary seclusion. \nhttp://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/May/14-crt-541.html 1/2\n\n6/17/2014 USDOJ: Justice Department Settles Lawsuit Against State of Ohio to End Unlawful Seclusion of Youth in Juvenile Correctional Facilities\n \n“The state of Ohio, the administrators of the Department of Youth Services and their counsel are to be\ncommended for their commitment to reforming Ohio’s juvenile correctional facilities,” said Acting\nAssistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division.  “Ohio’s commitments in this\nagreement will go a long way toward reducing the harm young people are experiencing in the state’s\njuvenile correctional facilities, especially young people with mental health needs.”  \n \n“This agreement will provide significant relief to youth in DYS custody by ensuring they receive\nappropriate mental health treatment and are not subject to excessive seclusion,” said U.S. Attorney\nCarter Stewart for the Southern District of Ohio.  “Today, the state has taken an important step in\nrectifying the unconstitutional conditions in its juvenile correctional facilities.”\n \n“We applaud the state for its commitment to rectifying the overuse of seclusion on youth in its custody,”\nstated U.S. Attorney Steven M. Dettelbach for the Northern District of Ohio.  “The agreement we are\nannouncing today – which is the result of the collective efforts of the Justice Department, the private\nplaintiffs and the state of Ohio – will put in place reforms that will drastically improve outcomes for\nthese youth.” \n \nThe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 authorizes the department to seek a remedy\nfor a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of youth in\njuvenile justice institutions.  Please visit the division website to learn more about this act and other laws\nenforced by the Civil Rights Division.\n \nThis agreement is due to the efforts of the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division, the U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the Southern District of Ohio, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of Ohio.  This agreement is also due to the work of plaintiffs’ counsel in S.H., Alphonse\nGerhardstein of Gerhardstein & Branch Co. LPA, and Kim Tandy of the Children’s Law Center Inc., and\nto the leadership of the Ohio DYS.\n14-541 Civil Rights Division\nABOUT   RESOURCES    CAREERS\nSite Map   For Employees\nThe Attorney General Forms Legal Careers\nArchive Office of the Inspector\nBudget & Performance Publications Interns, Recent Graduates, Accessibility General\nand Fellows\nStrategic Plans Case Highlights FOIA Government\nDiversity Policy Resources\nLegislative Histories   No FEAR Act\nAGENCIES Veteran Recruitment Information Quality Plain Writing\nUSA.gov\nNEWS Privacy Policy\nBUSINESS Justice News CONTACT Legal Policies & BusinessUSA\nBusiness Opportunities Disclaimers\nThe Justice Blog\nSmall & Disadvantaged\nBusiness Public Schedule  \nGrants Videos\nPhoto Gallery\nhttp://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/May/14-crt-541.html 2/2",
