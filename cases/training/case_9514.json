At an initial conference held on 10/1/99, a discovery schedule was set with respect to the individual pltffs. All discovery was to conclude by 6/23/00. By order dtd 6/23/00 this Court granted pltffs' request to extend the discovery schedule and directed the parties to complete discovery by 9/5/00. The parties were advised that in the event the class certification motion changed the landscape of discovery, the discovery schedule could be revised. On 3/8/01, Judge Hurley rendered a decision denying class certification. Inasmuch as the discovery cut−off date was 9/25/00 and there has been no class certification, this case will be marked ready for trial. A settlement conference will be held on 5/30/01 @10:00. If the case does not settle, this case will be marked ready for trial. In the event Judge Hurley reverses his prior decision dtd 3/8/01, the above settlement conference will include a discussion of a newly revised discovery schedule. set pretrial order due for 5/1/01 So Ordered.

As to the claim that the amount of the deposit is excessive as far exceeding the dollar amount of anticipated claims to be made against the common fund, that application is denied because (1) it was not advanced previously, and (2) it is unaccompanied by statutory or decisional authority indicating that the requested adjustment should be made. Lastly, the defendants correctly not that the judgment as written requires that deposit of the money absent any provision about interest being earned on those monies during a period they are held by the Court Clerk. Accordingly, as part of the anticipated stay application, I will entertain an application that I direct the Clerk to place the deposited common fund in an interest bearing account and I will welcome input from counsel as to the nature of the account into which the sums should be deposited. terminating 468 Motion to Alter Judgment.

The Court placed a hold (i.e. stoppage on the running of the three year statute of limitations) on May 20, 1999. That hold continues to be in effect until 180 days after June 16, 2016, so that you will have until at least December 13, 2016 to file an individual lawsuit for additional damages. This means the amount of time you have to file a separate lawsuit depends upon the date you were stripped search. For example, if you were strip searched anytime from May 20, 1996 until November 16, 1996, you have until December 13, 2016 to file a separate individual lawsuit for additional damages. For example, if you were strip searched on June 1, 1997, you would have one year after December 13, 2016 to file your individual lawsuit for additional damages. If you were strip searched on June 1, 1998, you would have two years after December 13, 2016 to file your individual lawsuit for additional damages. If you were strip searched on June 1, 1999, you have the entire three−year statute of limitations period to file a separate lawsuit. If you have a question about additional damages or the amount of time you have to file a separate you should contact an attorney. See attached Memorandum & Order. Ordered by Judge Denis R. Hurley on 7/28/2016. (Gapinski, Michele) (Entered: 07/28/2016)"

    "summary": "<p>On June 3, 1999, a plaintiff represented by New York attorney Robert L. Herbst filed a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiff challenged the blanket strip search policy of the Nassau County Correctional Center. Under the policy, all misdemeanor and minor offense arrestees were allegedly strip-searched without any suspicion that they were concealing weapons or other contraband. The plaintiff claimed that the policy violated the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification. This case, which was styled Augustin v. Jablonsky, followed another case, <a href=\"../../../../case/210/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shain v. Ellison</a>, 96-CV-3774, that was filed against Nassau County by attorney Herbst and also challenged the County's strip-search policy. This case was filed just days after the Court in Shain v. Ellison issued an order finding the Nassau County strip search policy unconstitutional. See Shain v. Ellison, 53 F.Supp.2d 564, 565 (E.D. N.Y. 1999).</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the Augustin case, two similar suits&mdash;<a href=\"../../../../case/9622/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">O'Day v. Nassau County</a>, 99-cv-2844, and <a href=\"../../../../case/9893/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Iaffaldano v. County of Nassau</a>, 99-cv-4238&mdash;had also been filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, challenging the blanket strip search policy of the Nassau County Correctional Center. All plaintiffs moved to consolidate the cases and for class certification for a class defined as \"all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been admitted to the Nassau County Correctional Center and strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion.\" The District Court (Judge Denis J. Hurley) consolidated the cases but denied class certification. 2001 WL 770839 (E.D. N.Y. Mar. 08, 2001).</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs renewed the motion for class certification several times, and each one was denied.</p>\r\n<p>The parties eventually entered into a stipulation for settlement, under which the defendants agreed to pay the lump sum of $350,000 to the ten named plaintiffs in the consolidated cases, who agreed to split the fund equally and receive $35,000 each. The stipulation reserved plaintiffs' right to appeal the District Court's orders denying class certification and, in the event that the orders were overturned, the defendants agreed that the named plaintiffs could continue to pursue the class claims and be entitled to receive up to $1,000 more in incentive payments if a class was eventually certified. If the orders denying certification were not overturned on appeal, the plaintiffs would be allowed to request attorneys' fees up to $125,000. Judge Hurley approved the settlement on July 5, 2005. The plaintiffs then appealed the certification denial.</p>\r\n<p>The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case with instructions to certify a class as to liability and consider certifying a damages class as well. In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219 (2nd Cir. 2006).</p>\r\n<p>On remand, the District Court certified a liability class and the parties briefed the issue of certification of a damages class. The liability class consisted of all persons arrested for misdemeanor and non-criminal offenses in Nassau County who thereafter were strip searched upon entry to Nassau County Correctional Center, from May 20, 1996, to June 1, 1999.</p>\r\n<p>On March 27, 2008, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion to extend class certification to include damages. The Court held a hearing in March 2009 and set the trial for September 2009. Following the hearing, the Court issued an opinion holding that the parties could select their own witnesses from the class, but that each witness would only be able to testify as to the facts of the strip search (and not their personal feelings about their experiences). 2009 WL 706252. The plaintiffs moved for the Court to reconsider the order that witnesses only testify as to the facts of their experiences, but the Court denied the motion. 2009 WL 1312909. The defendants, on the other hand, requested access to class members in order to select witnesses, but the Court also denied this request, stating that there was no need for access because witnesses would only testify as to the details of search procedures. 2009 WL 1456011.</p>\r\n<p>On February 25, 2010, the Court allowed the defendants to reduce the class size. 2010 WL 680988.</p>\r\n<p>Trial was held in late 2009, and on September 22, 2010, the Court held that the defendants had unlawfully strip searched people arrested for misdemeanor and non-criminal offenses after admitting them to the correctional center. The Court ordered the defendants to pay $500 per strip search in general damages to compensate each person affected by the unlawful searches. 742 F. Supp. 2d 304. The Court held that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) was inapplicable to this case and thus did not limit recovery, since the PLRA's recovery limitation applied only when a plaintiff was incarcerated at the time of bringing suit, and the named plaintiffs in this case were not incarcerated at the time of bringing suit. 2010 WL 3781563.</p>\r\n<p>On October 19, 2011, the Court decertified the class on the defendants' motion, holding that special damages must be determined on an individual basis. 819 F. Supp. 2d 153.</p>\r\n<p>On July 18, 2013, the defendants moved the Court to reconsider the January 16, 2007 order granting summary judgment on liability in favor of plaintiffs. The defendants based their argument on the Supreme Court's 2012 decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11854\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Florence v. Bd. Of Chosen Freeholders.</a>&nbsp;In that case, the Supreme Court decided that new-admit strip searches did not violate constitutional rights. This court followed Florence and granted the defendants' motion with respect to constitutional claims, but upheld its grant of summary judgment based on state claims against strip searches. 958 F. Supp. 2d 339.</p>\r\n<p>On April 2, 2014, the court awarded $4,018,030.25 in attorney fees and costs to the plaintiffs' class counsel. 2014 WL 1338426. On April 10, 2014 the court entered final judgment for the defendant on Federal constitutional claims, and for the plaintiff class on state constitutional claims, awarding $11,508,000 in damages as well as attorney's fees. Both the plaintiff class and the defendant filed appeals.</p>\r\n<p>The defendant filed for additional time to make the deposit necessary for the disbursement of compensatory damages. On April 30, 2014, Judge Denis R. Hurley denied this motion as premature. The defendants then moved for a show cause hearing to stay the execution of judgment. Following a show cause hearing on June 4, 2014, the court ordered to stay the award for 180 days, with an alternative option to stay payment indefinitely with the posting of a $11,508,000 bond.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed a motion to stay the final judgment in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals on November 12, 2014. The court granted this motion on December 23, 2014.</p>\r\n<p>On February 26, 2016, the Appellate court (Judge Jose A. Cabranes, Judge Rosemary S. Pooler, Judge Denny Chin) upheld the District court ruling. The court agreed with the District court's reasoning that there were no grounds for federal relief but there were state constitutional violations for which the plaintiffs were entitled to relief.</p>\r\n<p>On August 18, 2016, the Appellate court denied the defendants' motion to stay the mandate. On September 6, 2016, the defendants filed a writ of certiorari to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. On October 12, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the writ of certiorari.</p>\r\n<p>On June 19, 2017, the New York Solicitor General; the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA); the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS); and the New York State Department of Health (DOH) moved to intervene in the proceedings. On June 29, 2017, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) moved to intervene. Both sought intervention to acquire access to information so that the list of class members could be updated in an effort to locate class members and provide them with monetary relief. On July 26, 2017, Judge Hurley granted their motion to intervene, citing the fact that the intervenors had a genuine interest in the matter. The parties would then have access to the database, but limited to only updated addresses.</p>\r\n<p>The case is closed.</p>",

Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 308 n.11 (1986), a plaintiff may recover \n \nonly nominal damages in the absence of proof of actual injury. See 2 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 7.4(1)-(2) (2d ed.1993); \nsee, e.g., Ruggiero v. Krzeminski, 928 F.2d 558, 563-64 (2d Cir.1991) (upholding district court’s entry of nominal damages award \nin § 1983 action where the jury found a Fourth Amendment violation but did not award actual damages); Hunter v. Auger, 672 \nF.2d 668, 677 (8th Cir.1982) (directing the district court to allow nominal damages for a Fourth Amendment violation resulting \nfrom strip searches of relatives visiting prisoners at state penitentiary where there was no showing of actual damages). \n \n5  The first question is certainly a “common” one in the sense that it is common to any lawsuit filed in this district against which a \nRule 12(b)(6) motion has been made. But it is not common, of course, to the merits of any cause of action brought by Plaintiffs or \n \notherwise. Although the Shain decision appears likely to have some kind of class-wide significance, the Court is unsure what the \nPlaintiffs intend by their second question; whether Shain has res judicata value, offensive or defensive collateral estoppel value on \ncertain elements, or merely precedential value, has not yet been addressed in any degree of specificity by the parties. Finally, to the \nextent the effects of the PLRA would only impact certain plaintiffs, the seventh question raises the spectre of individualized \nstanding determinations, not determinations that are common to all members of the putative class. \n \n6  The Court considers the individualized questions raised by Defendants concerning whether particular plaintiffs will satisfy the \nclass definition to be more appropriately addressed as questions of class specificity, see Daniels, 198 F.R.D. at ___, 2001 WL \n \n62893 at *4, or class manageability under Rule 23(b)(3)(D), see Noon v. Sailor, No. NA99-0056-C-H/G, 2000 WL 684274, at *3-4 \n(S.D.Ind. Mar. 14, 2000), recons. denied, 2000 WL 684219 (S.D.Ind. Apr. 17, 2000), not predominance under Rule 23(b)(3). \n \n7  In a later decision, the court in Gary addressed the predominance question in a more expansive manner in denying the defendant’s \nmotion to decertify the class. See Gary v. Sheahan, No. 96-C-7294, 1999 WL 281347 (N.D.Ill. Mar. 31, 1999) [hereinafter “Gary \n \nII” ], appeal dismissed, 188 F.3d 891 (7th Cir.1999), reh’g and reh’g en banc denied, id. \n \n8  Inasmuch as the conclusion in Klein rested on additional factual considerations that do not appear to be present in this action, the \nforce of its conclusion as applied to this case is blunted. On the other hand, its reasoning as to the individualized inquiry of a \n \nplaintiff’s “emotional constitution” fully applies. \n \n \n  12 \n \n\nAugustin v.

The parties agree that they are entering into this \njudgment in order to settle these individual claims only, and to avoid the \nconsiderable expense that would be incurred by the continued complex and \nlengthy litigation of these claims.  Plaintiffs have requested that the $350,000 in \ndamages be distributed evenly among the ten individual plaintiffs.  Defendants \nhave no objection to this distribution.  The parties agree that the $35,000 in \ncompensatory damages received by each individual plaintiff in no way reflects a \nconcession by defendants that the amount received is the actual value of any such \nclaim made now or in the future.  Further, even if the denial of class certification \nis reversed on appeal, none of these ten individual plaintiffs can increase his or \nher compensatory damages, nor receive any punitive damages, based on his or her \ninjuries, but rather may only seek or receive additional compensation for \nattorney's fees and his or her time and effort as a class representative, subject to \nthe limits specified in paragraphs 7 and 9 below; \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 104      Filed 07/05/2005     Page 3 of 9\n\\2)  all class claims, including attorneys' fees and costs, are expressly reserved and \npreserved; \n(3)  the individual plaintiffs expressly retain the right to appeal denial of class \ncertification on behalf of the putative class; \n(4)  each individual plaintiff (a) suffered an \"actual, concrete injury\" and (b) will \nretain a \"personal stake\" in the outcome of the appeal of the denial of class \ncertification, including but not limited to the sharing of attorneys' fees and costs \nwith the putative class and compensation for time and effort expended as a class \nrepresentative as specified in paragraph 7 below; \n(5)  defendants will not oppose the individual plaintiffs' appeal of denial of class \ncertification on grounds of lack of standing or mootness arising from the \nsettlement of these cases. Defendants retain the right to raise standing and/or \nmootness objections to the appeal of class certification with respect to those issues \nfor which the existence of these grounds lies without regard to settlement of these \ncases; \n(6)  if the denial of class certification is reversed on appeal, the individual plaintiffs' \nstanding in this action will relate back to the time in which class certification was \ninitially deni ed; \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 104      Filed 07/05/2005     Page 4 of 9\n(7)  if the denial of class certification is reversed on appeal, defendants will not contest \nthe adequacy of the individual plaintiffs to continue to represent the certified class \nas class representatives on the basis that they have already settled their \ncompensatory and punitive damages claims.

INTRODUCTION \nAt the end of its August 24 decision directing the certification of a liability class, the \nSecond Circuit said with respect to a damages class: \nIn light of our direction to certify a class on the issue ofliability ... we also instruct \nthe District Court to consider anew whether to certify a class to damages as well. \nThe District Court should bear in mind that \"[t]here are a number of management \ntools available to a district court to address any individualized damages issues.\" \nIn re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219,231 (2d Cir. 2006) (citations \nomitted) \nAs this Court appeared to recognize at the November 28, 2006 conference, and as argued \nmore fully below, the Second Circuit has suggested strongly that the class plaintiffs' damages \nclaims should be addressed on a class-wide basis, and that this Court should exercise its \ndiscretion to determine the best way to do so in these particular circumstances.  We discern this \nsuggestion not merely from the appellate court's language, but also from the legal principles \nupon which it based its decision to certify the liability class, which apply equally to the issue of \ndamages certification and which militate strongly in favor of certification. \nThis Court would not be charting new territory by certifying a damages class.  As noted \nbelow, several other courts in the Second Circuit and elsewhere have certified damages classes in \nstrip search cases.  On the other hand, should this Court decline to certify a damages class, the \nreal-world consequences would be devastating to the class, and to the class members' ability to \npress their damages claims.  While each of the approximately 23,000 members would \ntheoretically have the right to retain counsel and press his or her compensatory and punitive \ndamages claims individually, we know from past experience in this County and in other strip \nsearch cases around the country that few would likely have the wherewithal and resources to \n2 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 3 of 12\nfollow through on their own by locating and hiring an attorney to bring an individual action. \nThus, practically, not certifying a damages class would mean the end of the case for almost all \n23,000, and they would recover nothing notwithstanding defendants' concession that all suffered \na human dignity and constitutional rights violation.  This would be a manifestly unjust result, and \none contrary to the reasoning and purpose of the Second Circuit's decision. \nAs the Second Circuit noted in its August 24 decision, there are numerous ways to \ndeal with damages on a class-wide basis after certification.  As discussed below, damages have \nbeen awarded on a class-wide basis in numerous strip search cases, using methods which could \neasily be applied in this case.  Certifying a damages class and adopting one of these mechanisms \nfor adjUdicating damages would be the fairest, most efficient, and most logical way to conclude \nthis case and adhere to the Second Circuit's mandate. \nII.  THE SECOND CIRCUIT DECISION STRONGLY SUGGESTS DETERMINING \nDAMAGES ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS \nA review of the Second Circuit's August 24 decision strongly suggests that certification \nof a damages class is the proper course of action for this Court to take.  This is based not only on \nthe language ofthe opinion itself, including the explicit and pointed instructions to consider \ncertifying a damages class, but also on its principal justifications for ordering certification of the \nliability class. \nA.  The Plain Language of its Opinion Reveals the Second Circuit's View that this \nCourt Should Certify a Damages Class \nBy \"instruct[ingJ\" this Court \"to consider anew\" whether to certify a class on damages as \nwell as liability, and by cautioning it that it \"should bear in mind\" that \"there are a number of \nmanagement tools available\" to a district court \"to address any individualized damages issues,\" \n3 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 4 of 12\nwe respectfully contend that the Court of Appeals made patent its view that certification appears \nto be just as appropriate in this case for damages as it was for liability.  The appellate court could \nsimply have remanded the case for liability certification and further proceedings as this Court \ndeemed fit and proper.  It did not.  Instead, the Second Circuit reached out to suggest damages \ncertification as well, specifically referring to prior Circuit case law emphasizing the various ways \nto manage a damages class.  Accordingly, the most logical reading of the August 24 decision is \nthat it signals that certification of a damages class is warranted and would be appropriate in this \ncase, leaving to the discretion of this Court how best to structure and manage the damages class \nto resolve the damages claims most fairly and efficiently on a class-wide basis. \nB.  The Principles Underlying the Second Circuit's Decision to Certify a Liability \nClass Apply to Certification of a Damages Class \nThis reading of the decision is supported not merely by its language but also by the \nprinciples which the Court of Appeals held required certification on liability; for those very same \nprinciples strongly support certification on damages as well.  Time and again the Second Circuit, \nciting its own precedent as well as the Federal Rules and Advisory Committee Notes, \nemphasized the foundational purpose of using the class action mechanism, namely the need to \nadjudicate claims in the fairest and most efficient manner possible.  Thus, in assessing the nature \nof this case and the justification for certification of a liability class, the Second Circuit stated that \nthe purpose of the class action mechanism is to \"achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, \nand to promote uniformity of decision to persons similarly situated ....\"  In re Nassau County \nStrip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 225, citing F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3) Adv. Corn. N. to 1966 Amend. \nAnd again, citing the Advisory Committee Notes to the Federal Rules and stating that Rule 23 \n4 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 5 of 12\n\"seeks greater efficiency via collective adjudication and, relatedly, greater uniformity of decision \nas to similarly situated parties.\" rd. at 228.  Ultimately it was the Second Circuit's emphasis on \nthis foundational principle that led it to find that certification was the fairest and most efficient \nmethod of adjUdicating these claims and thus the superior way to proceed. rd. at 230.  Notably, \none key component of the Second Circuit's finding was its view that \"concentrating the litigation \nin one forum streamlines the litigation process.\" rd. \nWhile the Second Circuit's analysis focused on certification for liability purposes, its \nreasoning, and these Rule 23 principles upon which it is based, are equally applicable to \ncertification for purposes of damages.  There can be no doubt that adjudicating damages on a \nclass-wide basis is the fairest and by far most efficient way to proceed. \nFor while a liability judgment and notice to the class would be significant developments \nin making the 23,000 class members aware of their rights and initially affording them a \ntheoretical opportunity to seek vindication of those rights, such judgment and notice would not \nbe remotely sufficient in these circumstances to enable them actually to obtain relief.  The class \nmembers here are not sophisticated businessmen well-versed in obtaining counsel to press civil \nclaims.  Most are among the more marginalized persons in our society, with the least resources .. \nin short, the least likely among us to be able to press the rest of the way on their own. See, e.g., \nD'alauro v. GC Services Ltd. Partnership, 168 F.R.D. 451, 458 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (in considering \nRule 23(b)(3) superiority, it \"is appropriate for the court to consider the 'inability of the poor or \nuninfonned to enforce their rights and the improbability that large numbers of class members \nwould possess the initiative to litigate individually\"') (quoting Haynes v. Logan Furniture Mali, \nInc., 503 F.2d 1161, 1165 (7th Cir. 1974)); Rodriguez v. Carlson, 166 F.R.D. 465 (E.D. Wash. \n5 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 6 of 12\n1996) (Rule 23(b )(3) class superior because highly unlikely that indigent non-English speaking \nplaintiffs would bring suit absent class certification); Patrykus v. Gomilla, 121 F.R.D. 357, 363 \n(N.D. Ill. 1988) (strip search case). \nOur initial research suggests that, even when damages have been settled on a class-wide \nbasis in strip search cases, generally only one-third or less of class members respond to notice \nand come forward to seek damages, even when all that is required is just filling out a \nquestionnaire.  Few if any class members ever come forward with their own lawyers to opt out \nand seek damages on their own, despite the availability of the recovery of legal fees pursuant to \nthe fee shifting provisions of the civil rights laws, such as 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Accordingly, if class \ncertification on damages were denied here, we can expect few if any of the 23,000 class members \nto appear with lawyers to commence individual cases on their own, and thus few if any would \nrecover anything. 1 \nThis is exactly what the defendants are counting on.  Having finally been prevented by the \nSecond Circuit from effectively escaping liability certification by conceding liability, defendants \nnow hope to avoid any real monetary consequences for their conduct by escaping certification on \ndamages.  Defendants know full well that most of the victims would not be able to pursue \nindividual damages litigation, for the same reasons the Second Circuit emphasized in \ndetermining that liability certification should not be denied:  where individual damages are \nlIndeed, it bears reminding that the only person to our knowledge who litigated the \nconstitutionality of the County's unconstitutional blanket strip search policy, in effect since at \nleast 1984, was an attorney, Ray Shain, who in 1996 had the motivation and resources to \ncommence the case which ultimately led to this class action case.  Other than Shain and this case, \nwe know of no other plaintiffs who have sought to challenge that policy or recover damages, \neven after the policy was declared unconstitutional in 1999. \n6 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 7 of 12\nrelatively low, there is less incentive for an individual class member to come forward and pursue \nhis or her claim individually, especially when he or she would be responsible for the costs of \nlitigation themselves.  Thus, there is a substantial risk that almost all of the 23,000 constitutional \nviolations in this case will go unremedied if class certification on damages is denied and \nindividuals are required to fend for themselves to pursue damages.  Such result would provide \nyet another road map for constitutional violators to follow in seeking to avoid any real \nconsequences for systemic unconstitutional conduct like that here. \nSection 1983 has a dual purpose - compensation to civil rights victims and deterrence to \nfuture unconstitutional conduct. See Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247,256-57 (1978).  Failing to \ncertify a damages class and adjUdicating damages on a class-wide basis would undermine both of \nthese purposes. \nDenying class certification on damages would have other patently undesirable results.  If \neven a small percentage of class members were to appear individually to try their damages \nclaims, the Court would be inundated with hundreds if not thousands of individual cases on its \ndocket, with the risk of wildly inconsistent jury verdicts on compensatory and punitive damages \nfor human dignity violations of a similar nature resulting from the same blanket unconstitutional \nstrip search policy. \nThus, requiring these class members to pursue individual damages actions creates the \nworst of both worlds and undermines the purposes of Rule 23 in every way - by effectively \ndenying real-world relief to most class members, by failing to provide a comprehensive method \nto ensure that victims truly receive a fair remedy for their constitutional injury, by undermining \nconsistency in adjudicating damages for similar injury, and by promoting inefficient and \n7 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 8 of 12\nburdensome individual litigation that might unnecessarily clog this Court's docket.  The Second \nCircuit obviously recognized these pitfalls in instructing the Court to consider all the \nmechanisms available to it to address damages on a class-wide basis.  And in fact, there are \nreadily available, effective, and manageable models for doing so in the strip search context, since \nall class action strip search cases we have found have resulted in a class-wide resolution of \ndamages claims, see, e.g., Brecher v. St. Croix County, 2004 WL 1196982 (W.D. Wis. 2004); \nBruce v. County of Renseelaer, 2003 WL 22436281 (N.D.N.Y. 2003);  Dodge v. County of \nOrange, 02-CV-769 (CM) (S.D.N.Y.); Marriot v. Montgomery County, 03-CV-531 (DNH) \n(N.D.N.Y.); Bynum v. District of Columbia, 02-CV-956 (RCL) (D.D.C.); Bull v. County of \nSacramento, 01-1545 (Cal. Super. Ct.);2  Mack v. Suffolk County, et al., 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. \n2000); Tyson v. City of New York, 97-CV-3762 (JSM) (S.D.N.Y.); Doe v. Calumet City, 1993 \nWL 512788 (N.D. Ill. 1993). \nIII.  METHODS FOR CLASS-WIDE DAMAGES ADJUDICATION \nThere are innumerable ways to adjudicate damages on a class-wide basis after \ncertification.  Significantly, based on a comprehensive review of the case law and conversations \nwith other practitioners in this field, we know of no strip search case where certification, at least \nfor liability, has been granted (which occurs in viliually every such case) that has not been \nresol\\Ted by settleme11t all a class-v/ide basis, and tllcrc is no reason that tIle sallIe should 110t \noccur here. \n2Bull was a state court action involving federal constitutional claims. \n8 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 9 of 12\nA.  Class-Wide Damages Resolution \nThere are a number of ways class damages claims have been resolved on a class-wide \nbasis that could be applied here.3 \nFirst, all class members could simply share a fixed class-wide damages fund on an equal, \npro-rata basis.  This model was employed in the Marriot v. County of Montgomery case.  We \nhave annexed the distribution plan for that damages structure as Exhibit A. \nA second way would be to create a tiered-system in which class members would be \ncategorized and given points based on certain factors, such as, for example, the nature of the \noffense for which he or she was arrested, and/or the number of unconstitutional strip searches to \nwhich they were subjected.  Then, damages would be distributed from a fixed class-wide \ndamages fund, \\vith those with more points receiving a greater share of the award.  A successful \nexample of this model of structuring class-wide damages was employed in Mack v. Suffolk \nCounty, supra.  The Mack distribution formula is annexed hereto as Exhibit B.4 \nB.  Class-Wide Damages Adjudication in the Absence of Settlement \nIn the event defendants, after defending an admittedly unconstitutional policy for almost \neight years, remain unwilling to settle on a class-wide basis, there are other models by which \n3We have recently been provided with categorical data on the more than 23,000 class \nmembers, including age, gender, crime(s) charged, and number of admissions.  After class \ncertification on damages, and after analyzing the data, we expect to be able to engage in \nsettlement discussions with defense counsel about which of these ways could most fairly and \nefficiently be applied in this case.  In the unlikely event that the case is note settled, we could \nthen recommend to defense counsel and the Court which of the methods summarized in Section \nB below could most fairly and efficiently be applied in this case to adjudicate the class mem bers' \ndamages claims. \n40ther models, of course, have been employed and are available. See, e.g., Tyson v. City \nof New York, supra. \n9 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 10 of 12\nclass damages claims can be litigated, borrowing from models employed in similar contexts \nwhere there may be some variance in the damages claims of class members but certainly, as here, \nnot sufficiently individualized to override the strong factors supporting class certification. \nOne method is to employ the tier-system utilized in Mack, discussed above, with \nrepresentative damages jury trials or hearings before a special master for a small sampling of \nindividuals from each ofthe tiers (or subclasses) of plaintiffs.  The average damages award per \nrepresentatives of each subclass could then be applied as the damages award for all class \nmembers in each damages subclass.  So, for instance, if the Court held damages trials or a special \nmaster conducted damages hearings for five representative members of one subclass and the \naverage of all the damages awards was $10,000, then all members ofthat subclass would be \na'.varded $10,000.  The advantage of this method is that it permits limited evidentiary hearings to \nhelp determine class-wide damages awards while minimizing the burden on the Court and the \nexpense to the parties. \nAnother method would be to follow the model set forth in Hilao v. Marcos, 103 F.3d 767 \n(9th Cir. 1996), which entailed conducting individual damages hearings for a larger, statistical \nsampling of subclass members.  Hilao involved a class of torture victims of the Marcos regime, \nwhere the physical and mental/emotional distress injuries would be expected to vary more widely \nthan the humiliation, human dignity and mostly garden-variety emotional distress injury here in \nthe strip search context.  Nevertheless, damages class certification was upheld by the Court of \nAppeals, along with the district court's trifurcation of the case.  Stage one determined liability \nand stage two punitive damages liability and class-wide exemplary damages.  The final stage of \nthe litigation involved litigation ofthe compensatory damages for class members.  This was \n10 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 11 of 12\naccomplished by taking a statistical sampling of 137 members of the approximately 10,000 \nmember class.  A special master conducted damages hearings for these 137 class members based \non seven different factors, including mental abuse, fright and anguish, age of the victim, and \nphysical and mental injuries.  The Special Master then made recommendations for 131 class \nmembers (recommending against awards for 6 members), which were divided into subclasses. \nHe then determined the average award for each subclass and recommended that conesponding \ndamages amount be awarded to each corresponding subclass member.  The same method could \nbe utilized in this case, with class-wide punitive damages adjudication last to comport with more \nrecent Supreme Court jurisprudence on punitive damages. \nAnother approach would simply be to appoint a special master to oversee individual \ndamages hearings, \"vhich \"vould havc the benefit of some unifol111ity of assessment among class \nmembers. \nYet another possible method would be comparable to that employed in  Lowery v. Circuit \nCity Stores, Inc., 158 F.3d 742, 754 (4th Cir. 1998), which we discussed in our February 25,2003 \nreply brief in support of our renewed motion for class certification.  A jury would be empaneled \nfor a period of a few weeks, hearing and adjudicating as many individual class members' \ndamages claims as feasible.  When that jury's period was complete, a new jury would be \nempaneled for the same period, and so forth until all the class members damages claims were \ntried. \nThe point is to certify the class for damages so that damages can be determined on a \nclass-wide basis, because it is both feasible and the right thing to do -- to make sure that the \nconstitutional rights of as many class members as possible can be vindicated by an award of \n11 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 12 of 12\ndamages while simultaneously deterring these defendants and other governmental institutions \nfrom employing unconstitutional schemes in the future.  Once defendants know that they can not \nescape responsibility for these violations by avoiding class certification on damages, we can then \nhave a serious settlement discussion.  If we can not settle, then we could have a more concrete \ndiscussion as to which of the feasible methods summarized above is best suited to the facts of \nthis case.  By that time, we will have had an 0ppOliunity to analyze the data recently provided to \nus in digital form by the County relating to the 23,000 class members, an analysis which is \nnecessary in order for class counsel to recommend a more specific method of adjudication in the \nabsence of settlement, for we will then know what factors, if any, we think meaningfully \ndistinguish the class members. \nIV. \nOur 23,000 class plaintiffs have so far waited between eight and eleven years for their \ndamages remedy.  A damages class should be certified without further delay, together with such \nother and further relief to plaintiffs which to this Court seems just and proper. \nDate:  New York, New York \nJanuary 17, 2007 \nRODert Herbst \nSpencer Freedman, Esq. \nOf Counsel \nTo:  Dennis Saffran, Esq., Counsel for Defendants \nMatthew D.

DEFINITIONS \n1.  A \"Claimant\" is a person who submits a valid complete Settlement Claim \nForm postmarked on or before September 20, 2002 to the claims administrator. \n2.  A \"Participating Class Member\")s a claimant who has been verified as a \nclass member by the claims administrator after review of the information supplied by the \nclaimant in the Settlement Claim Form. \n3.  The \"Data\" is the electronic booking data used by Suffolk County which has \nbeen provided to plaintiffs' counsel. \nII.  PARTICIPATING CLASS MEMBER VERIFICATION \n4.  The claims administrator will verify that a claimant is  a class member by \nreviewing the information provided by the claimant in the Settlement Claim Form and \nchecking it against the data. This information includes the claimant's name, social security \nnumber, date of birth and any alias information. \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56-3      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 3 of 8\n5.  If a claimant cannot be verified as a class member, the claims administrator \nwill send a Notice of Claim Denial to the claimant within- 14 davs of the deadline for \n/ \nsubmitting Settlement Claim Forms.  A copy of the notice is attached as Exhibit D.  Any \nclaimant who disagrees 'ivith the determination that she is not a class member may appeal \nto a special master to be appointed by the Court mthin 14 days from the date the claims \nadministrator sends the claimant the Notice of Claim Denial.  The claimant must submit \na written statement with supporting documentary evidence whjch shows that the data is \nincorrect or incomplete.  The evidence may include a notarized letter from t~e County, \ncriminal offender's record information (CORl), or certified court documents from  the \ncriminal case.  The special master will make a determination of class membership vvithin \n30 days of the claimant's appeal of claim denial and will report his findings to the claims \nadministrator and class counsel.  Rulings by the special master shall be final and binding. \n6.  Rose King, attorney for Suffolk County, has a1s·0 agreed to accept telephone \ncalls from claimants to verify the data.  If attorney King is able to verify that a claimant \nis a class member, she mll forward the verified class member's booking information to the \nclaims administrator and class counsel.  The verified class member mIl need not appeal \nto the special master. \n7.  If claimant is  verified  as  a class  member,  the claims  administrator will \nidentify all of the class member's booking admissions into the Jail during the class period \nby reviewing the name,  Suffolk County unique identification number, social security \nnumber and date of birth of the class member. \n2 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56-3      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 4 of 8\nIII.  SETTLEMENT CATEGORIES \n8.  To determine each participating class member's-share in the settlement, the \nclaims administrator will place the class member into one of four settlement categories \nbased on the data. \n9.  Membership in a settlement category vvill be determined based on the crime \ncharged at time of the participating class member's admission into the Nashua Street Jail. \nIf the participating class member was charged vvith more than one crime during t0e class \nperiod, the most severe crime determines her membership in a settlement \ncat~gory. \n10.

Hurley, Judge), denying plaintiffs’ repeated class certification motions\n32 for lack of common issue predominance.  The District Court expressed “considerable doubt” as\n33 to whether it could certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A) when it\n34 already had determined that plaintiffs’ claims as a whole failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)’s\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 2 of 21\n1 predominance requirement.  The District Court further concluded that, even if it could do so,\n2 common liability issues that defendants had conceded no longer factored into the predominance\n3 analysis.  The District Court thus denied plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class on the issue of\n4 liability.\n5 We hold that (1) district courts may certify a class on a particular issue regardless of\n6 whether plaintiffs’ claims, as a whole, satisfy the predominance test; (2) the District Court erred\n7 when it excised common liability issues from its predominance analysis due to defendants’\n8 concession; and, as a result, (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion in declining\n9 to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A).\n10 REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.\n11 _________________________________\n12 ROBERT L.

Goodman, County Attorney\n22 of Nassau County, David B. Goldin, Deputy County Attorney, on the brief), Mineola,\n23 NY, for Defendants-Appellees.\n24 _________________________________\n25 STRAUB, Circuit Judge:\n26 This appeal is the latest installment in a series of litigations over the Nassau County\n27 Correctional Center’s (“NCCC”) blanket strip search policy for newly admitted, misdemeanor\n28 detainees (“the policy”).  Plaintiffs, who were strip searched pursuant to the policy, appeal from a\n2\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 3 of 21\n1 series of orders entered in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Denis J.\n2 Hurley, Judge) denying their repeated motions for class certification on the ground that\n3 individual issues predominated over common ones.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) (requiring that\n4 “questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions\n5 affecting only individual members”).  \n6 During the course of class certification motion practice, plaintiffs requested that the\n7 District Court certify a Rule 23(b)(3) class solely on the issue of liability, as permitted by Rule\n8 23(c)(4)(A).  In response, defendants conceded their liability to plaintiffs.  The District Court\n9 denied the motion.  As an initial matter, the District Court expressed serious doubt over whether\n10 it could certify a class on the issue of liability since it already had determined that plaintiffs’\n11 claims, as a whole, failed the predominance test.  Even if it could do so, the District Court\n12 reasoned that defendants’ concession removed common liability issues from the predominance\n13 analysis.  With common liability issues so excised, the Court concluded that individual liability\n14 issues, such as the application of an affirmative defense, predominated.  The Court thus denied\n15 plaintiffs’ motions for class certification on the issue of liability.\n16 The precise issues on appeal are whether (1) a court may certify a Rule 23(b)(3) class as\n17 to a particular issue when it already has determined that the claim as a whole fails the\n18 predominance test; (2) common issues that are conceded remain part of the predominance\n19 analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion by failing to certify a class\n20 on the issue of liability.  As set forth more fully below, we hold that (1) a court may employ rule\n21 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class as to an issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies\n22 the predominance test; (2) the District Court erred when it concluded that defendants’ concession\n3\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 4 of 21\n1 eliminated liability issues from the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its\n2 allowable discretion by failing to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rules\n3 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A).  Accordingly, we reverse the District Court’s orders dated September 23,\n4 2003 and November 7, 2003 to the extent that they deny certification as to the issue of liability,\n5 and we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n6 BACKGROUND \n7 In 1999, the District Court for the Eastern District of New York held that defendants’\n8 blanket policy of strip searching newly admitted, misdemeanor detainees violated clearly\n9 established Fourth Amendment law.  See Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999),\n10 aff’d,  273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001).  Although the policy has never been formally enjoined, Shain\n11 v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2004) (vacating injunction for lack of standing), defendants\n12 assert that following the District Court’s 1999 decision, they ceased implementing it.\n13 Shortly after the District Court’s 1999 decision, plaintiffs brought three separate actions\n14 in the Eastern District of New York: Augustin v. Jablonsky, No. 99 Civ. 3126, O’Day et al. v.\n15 Nassau County Sheriff’s Department, et al., No. 99 Civ. 2844, and Iaffaldano v. County of\n16 Nassau, No. 99 Civ. 4238.  Together, plaintiffs named as defendants Nassau County, Sheriff\n17 Joseph P. Jablonsky, the Sheriff’s Department, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, the\n18 Division of Corrections, the Port Washington Police District and its chief of police, William\n19 Kilfoil, and up to 200 subordinate John and Jane Doe corrections officers.\n20 Each action alleged that plaintiffs were arrested on misdemeanor charges unrelated to\n21 weapons or drugs and thereafter strip searched, without individualized suspicion, pursuant to the\n22 policy.  Plaintiffs claimed that the strip searches violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Fourth, Fifth,\n4\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 5 of 21\n1 Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, section 12\n2 of the New York State Constitution.  They sought compensatory and punitive damages, a\n3 declaration that the policy was unconstitutional, and an injunction barring enforcement of the\n4 policy.  They also sought to maintain each litigation as a class action.\n5 In February of 2000, plaintiffs moved to consolidate all three actions and certify a unified\n6 class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3).1  Plaintiffs defined the class as follows: “[A]ll persons arrested\n7 for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been admitted to the Nassau County\n8 Correctional Center and strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion.”  In an\n9 opinion and order dated March 8, 2001, the District Court granted that branch of the motion\n10 seeking consolidation and denied that branch seeking class certification.  See Augustin v.\n11 Jabolonsky, No. 99 Civ. 3126, 2001 WL 770839 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2001). \n12 The District Court determined that plaintiffs satisfied the four requirements of\n13 numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n14 However, it denied certification for lack of common issue predominance.  The Court recognized\n15 certain common questions, namely, (1) whether defendants maintained a blanket strip search\n16 policy; (2) whether that policy was unconstitutional; and (3) whether some or all defendants may\n17 be held liable.  Nonetheless, it determined that individualized issues predominated, in particular:\n18 (1) whether subordinate Jane and John Doe defendants might escape liability in some cases\n19 because, notwithstanding the blanket policy, they had reasonable suspicion to search certain\n20 detainees; (2) the existence of proximate causation for each alleged injury; and (3) compensatory\n1Because motion practice on the question of class certification continued in various\niterations for more than four years, we describe only those aspects of the District Court’s\ndecisions that are relevant to our own.\n5\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 6 of 21\n1 and punitive damages calculations.\n2 The District Court noted the possibility of sua sponte certifying a class solely on the issue\n3 of liability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A), which allows for class certification “with respect to\n4 particular issues.”  It declined to do so because it did not wish to “undertake plaintiffs’ burden”\n5 to “craft and submit a proposal,” and because, as a legal matter, it perceived “considerable doubt\n6 as to the propriety of using Rule 23(c)(4)(A) in this fashion.”  In particular, the Court relied on\n7 Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734 (5th Cir. 1996) for the proposition that courts may not\n8 employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to single out the issue of liability for class treatment unless the “cause\n9 of action, as a whole,” first satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement.  Id. at 745 n.21\n10 (emphasis added by District Court).\n11 Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration.  They first asserted that they would no longer seek\n12 judgment against subordinate Jane and John Doe defendants.  Since that modification would\n13 render the question of liability identical for nearly all class members, plaintiffs next asserted that\n14 the Court should certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A).  They again\n15 defined the class as “all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been\n16 admitted to the [Nassau County Correctional Center] and strip searched without particularized\n17 reasonable suspicion.”\n18 In an opinion and order dated May 23, 2001, the Court agreed that plaintiffs’ forbearance\n19 of their claims against subordinate defendants “removes the possibility of individualized liability\n20 determinations.”  “To be sure,” the Court acknowledged, “the absence of individualized\n21 questions of liability militates in favor of partial certification solely on that issue.”  It\n22 nevertheless denied the motion.  \n6\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 7 of 21\n1 The District Court again noted its “concern that partial certification might not be\n2 appropriate in the first instance where the cause of action, as a whole, does not satisfy the\n3 predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).”  “Even assuming” that Rule 23(c)(4)(A) could be\n4 used in that fashion, the Court denied the motion because plaintiffs’ proposed class definition\n5 “would necessitate mini-trials just to determine class membership.”  In order to determine class\n6 membership, the Court believed, each would-be class member would have to show affirmatively\n7 that he was strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion – a criterion that the\n8 definition incorporated.  This burden was complicated by the fact that defendants claimed that\n9 they had ceased the blanket strip search policy after the Eastern District’s 1999 decision in Shain,\n10 and thereafter conducted strip searches only with particularized reasonable suspicion.\n11 In January 2003, plaintiffs renewed their motion for class certification as to liability and\n12 offered a new definition of the class as follows: “[A]ll persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-\n13 criminal offenses in Nassau County who thereafter were strip-searched at the NCCC pursuant to\n14 defendants’ blanket policy, practice and custom which required that all arrestees be strip-\n15 searched upon admission to the facility . . . .”  (alterations incorporated).  By referring only to the\n16 “blanket policy,” this new definition did not require plaintiffs to show that reasonable suspicion\n17 was absent in each case, and it excluded individuals strip searched after the 1999 Shain decision,\n18 when defendants ceased implementing the policy.  Plaintiffs also reiterated that they withdrew\n19 their claims against individual John and Jane Doe corrections officers.\n20 In response, defendants conceded “the one common issue” that in their view “might be\n21 appropriate for class certification . . . namely, whether the NCCC’s strip search policy during the\n22 class period was constitutional.”  (alterations incorporated).  Specifically, defendants recognized\n7\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 8 of 21\n1 that they “are bound by Shain under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.”  \n2 The District Court denied the renewed motion.  In an opinion and order dated September\n3 23, 2003, the Court determined that defendants’ concession removed all common liability issues\n4 from its predominance analysis.  Accordingly, the only liability issue that remained was an\n5 individual one: whether, notwithstanding the policy, some plaintiffs were searched based upon\n6 “reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.”  “With the liability issue thus\n7 circumscribed,” the Court wrote, “certification as to that issue would not serve any purpose.” \n8 Interestingly, the Court recognized that the individualized “‘reasonable suspicion inquiries’ will\n9 be de minimis” for two reasons: because defendants conceded that “such an inquiry will only be\n10 sought regarding a limited number of plaintiffs,” and because pursuant to United States v. Colon,\n11 250 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2001), reasonable suspicion must be possessed by some law\n12 enforcement officer at the time of the search and may not be retroactively imputed.\n13 Plaintiffs moved again for reconsideration on October 2, 2003.  In an opinion and order\n14 dated November 7, 2003, the District Court adhered to its earlier determinations and also\n15 concluded – for the first time – that for the same reasons informing its predominance analysis,\n16 plaintiffs failed to satisfy another one of Rule 23(b)(3)’s requirements, specifically, that the\n17 proposed class action be “superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\n18 adjudication of the controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In one last effort to “determine if its\n19 decision was in some other way improper,” the Court examined the policies of efficiency and\n20 uniformity animating Rule 23, and concluded that they did not favor certification.  The Court\n21 also noted that individual plaintiffs would have little trouble securing counsel to pursue their\n22 claims because their damages likely would be large enough to provide the necessary economic\n8\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 9 of 21\n1 incentive.\n2 The parties later reached a settlement in which defendants paid the lump sum of $350,000\n3 to the ten plaintiffs, who agreed to split the funds equally.  Plaintiffs reserved their right to appeal\n4 the District Court’s orders denying class certification, which they timely exercised.2 \n5 DISCUSSION\n6 I. Standard of Review\n7  We review the District Court’s denial of class certification for abuse of discretion. \n8 Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147, 162 (2d Cir. 2001).  However, we\n9 “review de novo the district court’s conclusions of law that informed its decision to deny class\n10 certification.”  Parker v. Time Warner Entm’t Co., 331 F.3d 13, 18 (2d Cir. 2003) (quotation\n11 marks omitted).  Further, we are “noticeably less deferential when the district court has denied\n12 class status than when it has certified a class.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted and alterations\n13 incorporated); Robinson, 267 F.3d at 162.  We note that while the application of the incorrect\n14 legal principle often necessitates reversal under the “abuse of discretion” standard, such reversal\n15 need not indicate any “abuse” by the District Court as that word is commonly understood.  See\n16 Zervos v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., 252 F.3d 163, 168-69 & nn.4-6 (2d Cir. 2001) (distinguishing\n17 among various meanings of “abuse of discretion”).  \n18 II. The Requirements and Purpose of Rule 23(b)(3)\n19\n20 In order to achieve class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs must (1) satisfy\n21 the four requirements of Rule 23(a), which are numerosity, typicality, commonality, and\n2Although these plaintiffs have settled their individual claims, they have reserved their\nright, in the event of a class settlement, to “seek or receive additional compensation for attorney’s\nfees and [their] time and effort as . . . class representative[s].”\n9\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 10 of 21\n1 adequacy of representation; (2) demonstrate that common “questions of law or fact” predominate\n2 over “any questions affecting only individual members”; and (3) establish that the class action\n3 mechanism is “superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\n4 controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\n5 As a general matter, the “Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed\n6 classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”  In re Visa\n7 Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 136 (2d Cir. 2001) (quotation marks\n8 omitted).  The Rule “encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve economies\n9 of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,\n10 without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.”  Fed. R. Civ.\n11 P. 23(b)(3) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend.\n12 In light of these purposes, we have set forth that although “a defense may arise and may\n13 affect different class members differently, [this occurrence] does not compel a finding that\n14 individual issues predominate over common ones.”  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 138 (internal\n15 quotation marks omitted).  So “long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class\n16 members together, variations in the sources and application of a defense will not automatically\n17 foreclose class certification.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted and alterations incorporated).\n18 III. The District Court Erred in Failing to Certify a Class on the Issue of Liability\n19 Pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A)\n20 As set forth more fully below, we conclude that the District Court erred by failing to\n21 certify a class on the issue of liability.3  We first conclude that, contrary to the District Court’s\n3We reach this conclusion without considering whether the District Court should have\ncertified a class as to plaintiffs’ entire claims – an issue that, as set forth more fully below, we\n10\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 11 of 21\n1 reservations, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class on a particular issue even if\n2 the action as a whole does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement.  Second, we\n3 hold that the District Court committed legal error in concluding that defendants’ concession\n4 eliminated common liability issues from Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance analysis.  Third, this\n5 error caused the District Court to exceed its allowable discretion in concluding that\n6 individualized liability issues predominated over common ones, and that the class action\n7 mechanism is not a superior litigation vehicle under these circumstances.\n8 A. A District Court May Certify a Class as to Specific Issues Regardless of\n9 Whether the Entire Claim Satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)\n10\n11 Whether a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class as to a specific issue\n12 where the entire claim does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement is a matter of\n13 first impression in this Circuit.  See Robinson, 267 F.3d at 167 n.12 (identifying question as one\n14 of first impression and declining to resolve it).  It also is a matter as to which the Circuits have\n15 split.  Id.  \n16 The Fifth Circuit has adopted a “strict application” of Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance\n17 requirement.  Id.  Under this view, “[t]he proper interpretation of the interaction between\n18 subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(4) is that a cause of action, as a whole, must satisfy the predominance\n19 requirement of (b)(3) and that (c)(4) is a housekeeping rule that allows courts to sever the\n20 common issues for a class trial.”  Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 745 n.21 (5th Cir.\n21 1996).\n22 The Ninth Circuit holds a different view.  Pursuant to that court’s precedent, “[e]ven if\nask the District Court to revisit in light of our holdings.\n11\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 12 of 21\n1 the common questions do not predominate over the individual questions so that class certification\n2 of the entire action is warranted, Rule 23 authorizes the district court in appropriate cases to\n3 isolate the common issues under Rule 23(c)(4)(A) and proceed with class treatment of these\n4 particular issues.”  Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 1996);  cf.\n5 Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 439 (4th Cir. 2003) (holding that courts may\n6 employ Rule 23(c) to certify a class as to one claim even though all of plaintiffs’ claims, taken\n7 together, do not satisfy the predominance requirement).  \n8 We agree with the Ninth Circuit’s view of the matter.  First, the plain language and\n9 structure of Rule 23 support the Ninth Circuit’s view.  Rule 23(c)(4) provides as follows:\n10 When appropriate (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a\n11 class action with respect to particular issues, or (B) a class may be\n12 divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the\n13 provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied\n14 accordingly.    \n15 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) (emphases added).\n16 As the rule’s plain language and structure establish, a court must first identify the issues\n17 potentially appropriate for certification “and . . . then” apply the other provisions of the rule, i.e.,\n18 subsection (b)(3) and its predominance analysis.  See Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439 (reasoning that\n19 the rule’s language provides this “express command” that “courts have no discretion to ignore”).\n20 Second, the Advisory Committee Notes confirm this understanding.  With respect to\n21 subsection (c)(4), the notes set forth that, “[f]or example, in a fraud or similar case the action\n22 may retain its ‘class’ character only through the adjudication of liability to the class; the members\n23 of the class may thereafter be required to come in individually and prove the amounts of their\n24 respective claims.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend. (emphasis added). \n12\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 13 of 21\n1 As the notes point out, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4) when it is the “only” way that a\n2 litigation retains its class character, i.e., when common questions predominate only as to the\n3 “particular issues” of which the provision speaks.  Further, the notes illustrate that a court may\n4 properly employ this technique to separate the issue of liability from damages.\n5 In addition, as the Fourth Circuit has noted, the Fifth Circuit’s view renders subsection\n6 (c)(4) virtually null, which contravenes the “well-settled” principle “that courts should avoid\n7 statutory interpretations that render provisions superfluous.”  State St. Bank & Trust Co. v.\n8 Salovaara, 326 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2003).  Pursuant to the Fifth Circuit’s view, “a court\n9 considering the manageability of a class action – a requirement for predominance under Rule\n10 23(b)(3)(D) – [would have] to pretend that subsection (c)(4) – a provision specifically included\n11 to make a class action more manageable – does not exist until after the manageability\n12 determination [has been] made.”  Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439.  Accordingly, “a court could only\n13 use subsection (c)(4) to manage cases that the court had already determined would be\n14 manageable without consideration of subsection (c)(4).”  Id.\n15 Finally, we note that the commentators agree that courts may use subsection (c)(4) to\n16 single out issues for class treatment when the action as a whole does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3). \n17 See 7AA Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1790 (3d ed. 2005) (stating that\n18 subsection (c)(4) “best may be used to designate appropriate classes or class issues at the\n19 certification stage” so that “the court can determine whether, as so designated, the other Rule 23\n20 requirements are satisfied”); 6 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions §\n21 18:7 (4th ed. 2002) (“Even cases which might not satisfy the predominance test when the case is\n22 viewed as a whole may sometimes be certified as a class limited to selected issues that are\n13\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 14 of 21\n1 common, under the authority of Rule 23(c)(4).”).\n2 For those reasons, we hold that a court may employ subsection (c)(4) to certify a class as\n3 to liability regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance\n4 requirement.\n5 B. The District Court Erred When It Concluded that Defendants’ Concession\n6 Eliminates Common Liability Issues from Rule 23(b)(3)’s Predominance\n7 Analysis\n8\n9 As noted above, the District Court reasoned that the major liability issues common to the\n10 class – whether defendants implemented a blanket strip search policy, and if so, whether they are\n11 liable for it – were eliminated from the predominance analysis by defendants’ concession. \n12 Whether a concession can limit the predominance analysis in that fashion also is a question of\n13 first impression.  For three reasons, we conclude that a concession does not eliminate a common\n14 issue from the predominance calculus, and that the District Court erred in holding otherwise.\n15 First, because the predominance analysis tests whether the class is a “‘sufficiently\n16 cohesive’” unit, In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 136, all factual or legal issues that are common to\n17 the class inform the analysis.  See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 621 (1997)\n18 (“Subdivisions (a) and (b) focus court attention on whether a proposed class has sufficient unity\n19 so that absent members can fairly be bound by decisions of class representatives.”).   In turn, an\n20 issue is common to the class when it is susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof.  In re Visa\n21 Check, 280 F.3d at 136 (“In order to meet the predominance requirement . . . a plaintiff must\n22 establish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof, and thus\n23 applicable to the class as a whole, predominate over those issues that are subject only to\n14\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 15 of 21\n1 individualized proof.” (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration incorporated)); see also\n2 Heerwagen v. Clear Channel Commc’ns, 435 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that “a\n3 plaintiff must show that those issues . . . subject to generalized proof outweigh those issues that\n4 are subject to individualized proof”); Moore v. PaineWebber, Inc., 306 F.3d 1247, 1252 (2d Cir.\n5 2002) (same).  That the class-wide proof comes in the form of a simple concession rather than\n6 contested evidence certainly shortens the time that the court must spend adjudicating the issue,\n7 but it does nothing to alter the fundamental cohesion of the proposed class, which is the central\n8 concern of the predominance requirement.  See 2 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg\n9 on Class Actions § 4:25 (4th ed. 2002) (“[T]he predominance test does not involve a comparison\n10 of court time needed to adjudicate common issues weighed against time needed to dispose of\n11 individual issues . . . .”); 7AA Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1778 (3d ed.\n12 2005) (“[C]lockwatching is not very helpful in ascertaining whether class-action treatment would\n13 be desirable in a particular case.”).  Similarly, the fact that an issue is conceded or otherwise\n14 resolved does not mean that it ceases to be an “issue” for the purposes of predominance analysis. \n15 Even resolved questions continue to implicate the “common nucleus of operative facts and\n16 issues” with which the predominance inquiry is concerned.  See Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v.\n17 Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir. 2000) (“[T]he fact that an issue has been resolved on\n18 summary judgment does not remove it from the predominance calculus.”).  Just as much as do\n19 contested issues, resolved issues bear on the key question that the analysis seeks to answer:\n20 whether the class is a legally coherent unit of representation by which absent class members may\n21 fairly be bound. \n22 Second, Rule 23 seeks greater efficiency via collective adjudication and, relatedly, greater\n15\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 16 of 21\n1 uniformity of decision as to similarly situated parties.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) adv. comm. n.\n2 to 1966 amend.  For these reasons we have written that when plaintiffs are “allegedly aggrieved\n3 by a single policy of defendants,” such as the blanket policy at issue here, the case presents\n4 “precisely the type of situation for which the class action device is suited” since many nearly\n5 identical litigations can be adjudicated in unison.  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 146.  \n6 Eliminating conceded issues from Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance calculus would\n7 undermine the goal of efficiency by requiring plaintiffs who share a “commonality of the\n8 violation and the harm,” nonetheless to pursue separate and potentially numerous actions\n9 because, ironically, liability is so clear.  Id. (noting that class action management “problems pale\n10 in comparison to the burden on the courts that would result from trying the cases individually”). \n11 Such a result also undermines the goal of uniformity by creating the risk of inconsistent decisions\n12 through the repeated litigation of the same question; here, for example, each individual plaintiff\n13 would have to establish anew that defendants were collaterally estopped by their prior concession\n14 and, if not, that defendants were liable on the merits.  Cf. Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc., 208 F.3d\n15 at 299 (concluding that because certification was “necessary to determine whether the prior\n16 resolution carries res judicata effect with respect to purported class members,” the district court\n17 properly took account of “the common nucleus of operative facts and issues, even though certain\n18 of these already had been resolved”).  Although defendants have conceded liability to these\n19 plaintiffs, there is no guarantee that they would concede liability in a case or series of cases\n20 involving significantly higher damages.  Further, courts might differ as to whether, in light of the\n21 settlement, the requirements of collateral estoppel were met, specifically, whether the issue of\n22 liability was “actually litigated and decided” and whether its “resolution  . . . was necessary to\n16\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 17 of 21\n1 support a valid and final judgment on the merits.”  Ball v. A.O. Smith Corp., 451 F.3d 66, 69 (2d\n2 Cir. 2006); cf. In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 429 F.3d 370, 387 n.15 (2d Cir. 2005)\n3 (“[I]t is clearly a permissible byproduct of settlement that future hypothetical plaintiffs might be\n4 forced to relitigate the same issues involved in the settled cases.”); Marvel Characters, Inc. v.\n5 Simon, 310 F.3d 280, 289 (2d Cir. 2002).\n6 Finally, we find further support for our view in the specific circumstances of this case. \n7 Defendants possess, but have not disclosed, records of all the newly-admitted misdemeanor\n8 detainees strip searched pursuant to the blanket policy.  Absent class certification and its\n9 attendant class-wide notice procedures, most of these individuals – who potentially number in the\n10 thousands – likely never will know that defendants violated their clearly established\n11 constitutional rights, and thus never will be able to vindicate those rights.  As a practical matter,\n12 then, without use of the class action mechanism, individuals harmed by defendants’ policy and\n13 practice may lack an effective remedy altogether.  Cf. Deposit Guar. Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445\n14 U.S. 326, 339 (1980) (noting that in certain cases “aggrieved persons may be without any\n15 effective redress unless they may employ the class-action device”); Tardiff v. Knox County, 365\n16 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (“[F]or most strip search claimants, class status here is not only the\n17 superior means, but probably the only feasible one (one-way collateral estoppel aside), to\n18 establish liability and perhaps damages.”).  Further, if defendants may utilize their concession to\n19 defeat class certification, it would work the perverse result of allowing them to escape the cost of\n20 their unconstitutional behavior precisely because their liability is too plain to be denied.  No\n21 other court has sanctioned such a result; nor shall we.\n22 Accordingly, we hold that defendants’ concession of liability does not eliminate that\n17\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 18 of 21\n1 otherwise common issue from Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance analysis, and the District Court\n2 erred when it concluded to the contrary.\n3 C. The District Court Erred in Determining that, as to Liability, Individual Issues\n4 Predominated\n5\n6 As we have established, the District Court was (1) free to certify a class on the issue of\n7 liability notwithstanding its conclusion that the action as a whole did not satisfy the\n8 predominance requirement and (2) required to consider conceded common liability issues in its\n9 predominance analysis.  We now apply these principles to the District Court’s opinion and order\n10 dated September 23, 2003 in which it denied certification on the issue of liability, as well as that\n11 dated November 7, 2003 in which it adhered to its September decision.  The class definition at\n12 issue was as follows: “[A]ll persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in\n13 Nassau County who thereafter were strip-searched at the NCCC pursuant to defendants’ blanket\n14 policy, practice and custom which required that all arrestees be strip-searched upon admission to\n15 the facility . . . .”  (alterations incorporated).  \n16 As noted, that definition obviated the need for individualized proceedings to determine\n17 class membership.  The definition referenced only defendants’ “blanket policy,” thus avoiding\n18 questions of probable cause and excluding individuals strip searched after the policy’s cessation.\n19 Since defendants possess records of misdemeanor detainees strip searched during the policy\n20 period, determining class membership would be simple.  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 142\n21 (approving class certification where “class members . . . can be identified by defendants’ own\n22 records”).\n23 The class definition also implicated two broad common liability issues: whether the\n18\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 19 of 21\n1 blanket policy existed and whether defendants are liable for its implementation.  The only\n2 countervailing, individualized liability issue was whether, regardless of the policy, some\n3 plaintiffs were strip searched based upon “reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.” \n4 The existence of this defense does “not . . . foreclose class certification.”  Id. at 138 (internal\n5 quotation marks omitted).  Further, as the District Court recognized, “any such ‘reasonable\n6 suspicion inquiries’ will be de minimis”; indeed, defendants set forth that “such an inquiry will\n7 only be sought regarding a limited number of plaintiffs.”  In light of the pervasive character of\n8 the common liability issues and the admittedly de minimis nature of individualized liability\n9 issues, we conclude that the District Court erred by holding that individual liability issues\n10 predominated over common ones in its decisions dated September 23, 2003, and November 7,\n11 2003.\n12 D. The District Court Erred in Concluding that the Class Action Device Is Not a\n13 Superior Litigation Mechanism\n14\n15 For Rule 23(b)(3) certification to be proper, a class action also must be the most “fair and\n16 efficient” method of resolving this case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In analyzing that question,\n17 courts must consider four nonexclusive factors: (1) the interest of the class members in\n18 maintaining separate actions; (2) “the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the\n19 controversy already commenced by or against members of the class”; (3) “the desirability or\n20 undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum”; and (4) “the\n21 difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.”  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n22 23(b)(3).  Contrary to the District Court’s conclusion in its decision dated November 7, 2003, all\n23 of these factors – as well as the reasons set forth above regarding efficiency and fairness – favor\n19\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 20 of 21\n1 class certification.\n2 First, the class members have little interest in maintaining separate actions since there\n3 already exists a concession of liability in this action and, without class notification, most putative\n4 class members will not even know that they suffered a violation of their constitutional rights. \n5 Second, this action already has progressed substantially and, again, offers the benefit of a liability\n6 phase that can be resolved quickly and conclusively.  Third, concentrating the litigation in one\n7 forum simplifies and streamlines the litigation process.  Fourth, we perceive little difficulty in\n8 managing a class action on the issue of liability, especially since the District Court already has\n9 noted that any individualized inquiries will be few and far between.  Accordingly, we conclude\n10 that the District Court erred in holding that a class action was not the most fair and efficient\n11 litigation vehicle under these circumstances.\n12 CONCLUSION\n13 We hold that (1) district courts may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class on a\n14 designated issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies the predominance test; (2)\n15 conceded common issues remain part of the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court\n16 exceeded its allowable discretion in denying Rule 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A) class certification on the\n17 issue of liability in its decisions dated September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003.4\n4Because we have found that certification as to liability is proper pursuant to Rule\n23(b)(3), there is “no necessity” of addressing alternate grounds for certification, such as Rule\n23(b)(2), that the District Court rejected.  Cf. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 147 (declining to\nreview district court’s ruling on Rule 23(b)(2) certification after concluding that Rule 23(b)(3)\ncertification was proper) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, since we base our decision\non the September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003 orders, we need not consider the District\nCourt’s August 20, 2004 order, in which it rejected a radically different class definition for\nfailure to satisfy Rule 23(a).  \n20\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 21 of 21\n1 In light of our direction to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to the definition\n2 set forth in the September 23 decision, we also instruct the District Court to consider anew\n3 whether to certify a class as to damages as well.  The District Court should bear in mind that\n4 “[t]here are a number of management tools available to a district court to address any\n5 individualized damages issues,” such as bifurcation, the use of a magistrate or special master,\n6 alteration of the class definition, the creation of subclasses, or even decertification after a finding\n7 of liability.  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 141.  \n8 In sum, we remand to the District Court with instructions to certify a class as to liability\n9 and consider certifying a damages class as well.\n21",

Goodman\nNassau County Attorney\nOne West Street\nMineola, New York 11501\nBy: Dennis J. Saffran, Esq.\nLiora Ben-Sorek, Esq.\n\nHURLEY, Senior District Judge:\nFollowing remand by the Second Circuit, see In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, \n461 F.3d 219 (2d Cir. 2006), this Court, by Order dated January 16, 2007, (1) certified for\nliability purposes a class consisting of “all persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal\noffenses in Nassau County who thereafter were strip searched at the Nassau County Correctional\nCenter pursuant to defendants’ blanket policy, practice and custom which required that all\narrestees be strip-searched upon admission to the facility, from May 10,1996 until and including\nJune 1, 1999\"; (2) appointed counsel for the class; and (3) granted summary judgment on liability\nfor all strip searches upon admission to the facility against defendants Joseph Jablonsky and the\nCounty of Nassau and in favor of the certified class and each and every member thereof. \nPresently before the Court is Plaintiffs’ application to certify the class as to Plaintiffs’ entire\nclaims, i.e., to extend class certification to include damages.  Defendants oppose the application\non the grounds that the predominance test for class certification cannot be met because of the\n“highly variable and individualized damages” of the class members.  As set forth in detail below,\nthe Court finds that extending class certification to the entire claim is appropriate because\nquestions common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers and a class action is superior to other available methods for adjudicating this\ncontroversy.  Accordingly, the application is granted.\nBackground\nThe background of this action is set forth in the prior decisions of this Court as well as\nthe Second Circuit’s decision directing this Court to certify a class on liability and to consider \n2\n\nanew whether to certify a class as to damages as well.  Familiarity with those decisions is\npresumed.   It suffices to note that these consolidated actions seek damages due to the blanket\npolicy of the Nassau County Correction Center (“NCCC”) of strip searching newly admitted,\nmisdemeanor detainees.   Said policy was declared to violate clearly established Fourth\nAmendment law in Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), aff’d in part,\nremanded in part, 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001).\nDiscussion\nI.  Class Certification Generally\nClass action certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  Class\ncertification may be granted only if the court “is satisfied after a ‘rigorous analysis’ that the\nprerequisites of Rule 23 have been satisfied.”  In re Initial Public Offering Sec. Litig., 471 F.3d\n24, 32 (2d Cir. 2006), clarified on denial of rehear’g, 483 F.3d 70 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Gen.\nTel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)).  The following standard governs\nclass certification motions in the Second Circuit:\n(1) a district judge may certify a class only after making\ndeterminations that each of the Rule 23 requirements has been met;\n(2) such determinations can be made only if the judge resolves\nfactual disputes relevant to each Rule 23 requirement and finds that\nwhatever underlying facts are relevant to a particular Rule 23\nrequirement have been established and is persuaded to rule, based\non the relevant facts and the applicable legal standard, that the\nrequirement is met; (3) the obligation to make such determinations\nis not lessened by overlap between a Rule 23 requirement and a\nmerits issue, even a merits issue that is identical with a Rule 23\nrequirement; (4) in making such determinations, a district judge\nshould not assess any aspect of the merits unrelated to a Rule 23\nrequirement; and (5) a district judge has ample discretion to\n3\n\ncircumscribe both the extent of discovery concerning Rule 23\nrequirements and the extent of a hearing to determine whether such\nrequirements are met in order to assure that a class certification\nmotion does not become a pretext for a partial trial of the merits.\nId.  \nA moving party must satisfy all four prerequisites to certification contained in Rule 23(a). \nAdditionally, the class must be maintainable as defined in Rule 23(b).  This Court has already\nfound that Rule 23(a)’s requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy have\nbeen met in this case. \nTurning then to Rule 23(b), it is subsection 3 on which these Plaintiffs rely.  Under Rule\n23(b)(3), a class action may be maintained if: \n(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the\nmembers of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of the controversy. . . .\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\nFor a class to be certified under Rule 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs must demonstrate both (1) that\nthe questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions\naffecting only individual members; and (2) that a class action is superior to other available\nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\nII.  The Requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) Have Been Met\nA.   Rule 23(b)(3) Generally\nThe predominance and superiority requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) “ensure that the class\nwill be certified only when it would ‘achieve economies of time, effort and expenses and\npromote . . . uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated, without sacrificing \n4\n\nprocedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.’”  Cordes & Co. Fin. Servs. Inc.\nv. A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., 502 F.3d 91, 104 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Amchem Prods. Inc. v.\nWindsor, 521 U.S. 591, 615 (1997) (ellipses in original)). \n“To meet the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3), a plaintiff must establish that\nthe issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof, and thus applicable to the class\nas a whole . . . predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized proof.”  In re\nVisa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 136 (2d Cir. 2001) (quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).  The predominance inquiry “tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently\ncohesive to warrant adjudication by representation,” Moore v. PaineWebber, Inc., 306 F.3d 1247,\n1252 (2d Cir. 2002), and “all factual or legal issues that are common to the class inform the\nanalysis.”  Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 227.  “[A]n issue is common to the\nclass when it is susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof.”  Id.   “The Rule ‘encompasses\nthose cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and\npromote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated, without sacrificing procedural\nfairness or bringing about other undesirable results.’”  Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) adv.\ncomm. n. to 1966 amend.). \nB.  The Contention of the Parties   \nIn their initial submission following remand by the Second Circuit, Plaintiffs argued that\nthe class certification should include damages so that damages can de determined on a class wide\nbasis.  Plaintiffs suggested several “models” whereby damages could be determined class wide.  \nTwo of the models were settlement models previously rejected by this Court.  Another model \n5\n\nwas one that was discontinued when it proved too cumbersome, leading to decertification of the\nclass before damages were determined.  See Lowery v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 158 F.3d 742,\n758 (4th Cir. 1998).  The final model was one that the appellate court conceded was\n“unorthodox” and raised serious due process concerns but was justified by the extraordinarily\nunusual nature of the case.  See Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 782-87 (9th Cir. 1996).  \n  In response to queries by this Court, Plaintiffs have refined their position.  Plaintiffs\nmaintain that the injury to human dignity is common to the class in its scope, nature, cause and\nharm suffered.  They assert that “[t]he amount recoverable for this injury does not depend on the\ncharacteristics of each individual; rather the injury to human dignity suffered by each plaintiff,\nand resulting right to compensatory damages for such injury, redound to each plaintiff in the\nsame manner because of his or her humanity.”  Pls.’ Mem. in Further Supp. of Cert. of a\nDamages Class Pursuant to Court’s May 30, 2007 Order (“Pls.’ Supp. Mem.”) at 2.   It is further\nargued that the injury to human dignity is inextricably intertwined in the nature of the unlawful\nact at issue - the strip search - and therefore certain damages can be presumed such that there are\nsufficient commonalities as to damages to support a finding of predominance.  Id.1   Defendants\nrespond that presumed or general damages are granted only in limited, individual situations and\nthe award of presumed or general damages in a class action is unprecedented and was, in fact,\nimplicitly rejected by the Second Circuit in the context of a strip search in Shain v. Ellison, 273\n1  With respect to those class members that may have suffered special damages, Plaintiffs\nare unwilling to concede at this point that such damages may not be common.  They maintain the\nCourt should find predominance in the damages for human dignity issue and await discovery\nbefore determining how to handle any claims of special damages. \n6\n\nF.3d 56, 67 (2d Cir. 2001).  Defs.’ Supp. Mem. Pursuant to Court’s May 30, 2007 Order in Opp.\nto Cert. of a Damages Class (“Defs.’ Supp. Mem.”) at 2. \nC.  The Issue of General Damages for Dignity Harm Predominates\nIn Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247 (1978) and Memphis Community Sch. Dist. v. Stachura,\n477 U.S. 299 (1986), the Supreme Court established the basic parameters for awarding\ncompensatory damages in Section 1983 actions.  The Court in Carey held, in a case involving\nprocedural due process, that it is inappropriate to permit “presumed damages.”  Rather, the\npurpose of damages awards in § 1983 actions is to compensate for actual injury.  In the absence\nof proof of actual injury, students wrongfully suspended from school in violation of procedural\ndue process were entitled only to nominal damages and not unspecified damages to compensate\nthem for injury inherent in the nature of the wrong.  435 U.S. at 252-55.  In Memphis\nCommunity, the Court reiterated that when “§ 1983 plaintiffs seek damages for violations of\nconstitutional rights, the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to principles\nderived from the common law of torts.”  477 U.S. at 306.    To that end, “damages based on the\nabstract ‘value’ or ‘importance’ of constitutional rights are not a permissible element of\ncompensatory damages in [§ 1983] cases” and “nominal damages, and not damages based on\nsome undefinable ‘value’ of infringed rights, are the appropriate means of vindicating rights\nwhose deprivation has not caused actual, provable injury.”  Id. at 308 & n.11, 310.  Whether the\nconstitutional basis for § 1983 liability is substantive or procedural, “damages must always be\ndesigned to compensate for the constitutional deprivation.”  Id. at 309.   \nThe Court in Memphis Community did, however, distinguish between damages based on\nthe value of the constitutional right violated and presumed damages.  The Court stated: “When a\n7\n\nplaintiff seeks compensation for an injury that is likely to have occurred but difficult to establish,\nsome form of presumed damages may possibly be appropriate. . . . In those circumstances\npresumed damages may roughly approximate the harm that the plaintiff suffered and thereby\ncompensate for harms that may be impossible to measure.”  Id. at 311 (citations omitted).    \nHere, the Plaintiffs are not claiming damages based on the value of their Fourth\nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.   Such a claim is\nforeclosed by Carey and Memphis Community.  Plaintiffs maintain that once an illegal strip\nsearch is shown to have taken place, a fortiori there is injury to human dignity.  This position\nfinds support in the Second Circuit’s decision in Kerman v. City of New York, 374 F.3d 93 (2d\nCir. 2004). \nIn Kerman, a jury found that the plaintiff’s fourth amendment rights were violated by his\nunjustified detention in a psychiatric hospital overnight but awarded him only nominal damages\nof one dollar.  The trial court denied the motion of the plaintiff, Kerman, for a new trial as to\ndamages on his fourth amendment claims and Kerman appealed.  The Second Circuit reversed,\nholding that while Kerman was not entitled to a new trial with respect to damages for his claimed\nphysical pain, mental suffering and medical expenses, he should have been granted a new trial\nwith respect to damages for his loss of liberty.  Id. at 122.  \nThe Second Circuit began its damages discussion by noting that a plaintiff is not\nautomatically entitled to a substantial damages award because he has been deprived of a\nconstitutional right.  For example, “when a jury has found that the plaintiff proved a defendant\nused excessive force against him in violation of his rights under the Fourth or Fifth Amendment,\na verdict that the plaintiff is not entitled to compensatory damages is not necessarily\n8\n\nimpermissible.  A jury could reasonably find that only nominal damages are appropriate where\nfor example, a plaintiff’s testimony as to his injuries lacks objective support or credibility, or\nwhere both justified force and unjustified force were used, either of which could have caused his\ninjuries . . . .”  Id.  at 123.   Applying these principles to the case before it, the Kerman court\nconcluded that the jury was not required to credit the testimony regarding Kerman’s mental\nsuffering and psychological injuries and therefore he was not entitled as a matter of law to\ncompensatory damages for his claims of physical pain, medical expenses, emotional suffering\nand psychological injuries. Id. at 124.  \nThe Court then turned to Kerman’s damages claim for his loss of liberty and\ndistinguished it from his other damages claims.  “In contrast, where the jury has found a\nconstitutional violation and there is no genuine dispute that the violation resulted in some injury\nto the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to an award of compensatory damages as a matter of law.” \nId.  The Court noted that in Raysor v. Port Authority, 768 F.2d 34, 38-39 (2d Cir. 1985) “where\nthe plaintiff was indisputably deprived of his liberty, and the conduct of the defendant\nresponsible for the deprivation was found to be unlawful, [it has] held that the plaintiff is entitled\nto compensatory, not merely nominal, damages.”  The Court continued:\nRaysor is consistent with traditional common-law principles\ngoverning entitlement to damages for the tort of false\nimprisonment.  That tort ‘is complete with even a brief restraint of\nthe plaintiff’s freedom; it is not necessary that any damages result\nfrom it other than the confinement itself. . . . The compensatory\ndamages that may be awarded for false imprisonment fall into two\ncategories: general damages and special damages. . . . General\ndamage is a harm of a sort inseparable from the unlawful restraint.\n. . . For false imprisonment, upon pleading and proving merely the\nunlawful interference with his liberty, the plaintiff is entitled to\ngeneral damages for loss of time and humiliation or mental\n9\n\nsuffering. . . . Items of special damage [, on the other hand,]\ncommonly include physical discomfort, shock or injury to health,\nloss of employment and injury to the plaintiff’s reputation or credit\nand must be specifically pleaded and proven. . . . In contrast\ngeneral damage need not be specifically proved - it may be inferred\nfrom the circumstances of the arrest or imprisonment and would\ninclude at least the value of the time lost by the plaintiff during the\nperiod of detention.\n374 F.3d at 125 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Because the jury was not instructed\nthat if they found the defendant had acted without probable cause Kerman was entitled to\ncompensatory damages for his loss of liberty, a new trial was necessary.   Id. at 129.  Accord\nGardner v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., 907 F.2d 1348 (2d Cir.1990) (upholding separate\ndamages awards for (1) general damages for deprivation of liberty, redressing the denial of free\nmovement and the violation done to the plaintiff’s dignity as a result of the unlawful detention,\nand (2) special damages for pain and suffering from the resultant anxiety disorder). \nHere, it cannot be disputed that the violation at issue  - the strip search - resulted in some\ninjury to the class members.  As Plaintiffs aptly state:\nThe language used in cases to describe unlawful strip\nsearches captures the intuitive understanding of the harm\nnecessarily caused by such searches.  The intrusion caused by a\nstrip search is so great that objection to it is “instinctive.”  See Bell\nv. Wolfish, 411 U.S. 520, 528 (1979) (strip-search with visual\ninspection is the practice that “instinctively” gives “the most\npause”).  Strip-searches have been variously characterized as “a\nserious impairment of privacy” and a “serious intrusion.” N.G. v.\nConnecticut, 382 F.3d 225, 234 (2d Cir. 2004); “uniquely invasive\nand upsetting,” id. at 239 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting); and\n“demeaning,” “dehumanizing” and “terrifying,” MaryBeth G. v.\nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).  See Weber\nv. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986) (describing strip/body\ncavity searches as “so intrusive and demeaning”); Doe v. Renfrow,\n631 F.2d 91, 93 (7th Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (unlawful strip search\nviolated “any known principle of human decency” and “exceed[ed]\n10\n\nthe ‘bounds of reason’ by two and a half country miles”). \n. . .  In Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F. Supp. 486, 489 (E.D. Wisc.\n1979), the district court observed that as to visual strip search\n“[w]hile the total time involved in a strip search is minimal, the\nhumiliation and embarrassment experienced by the offenders are\nmuch more lasting,” and described a strip search as being “an\nintrusion on one’s personal dignity,” id. at 490.  Notably, most of\nthese descriptions of the violative quality of unlawful strip searches\nwere offered without specific references to the plaintiffs’ testimony\nabout their experiences; rather, the courts spoke to the common\nnature of the harm caused by strip searches.\nPls.’ Supp. Mem at 8-9.  At the very least, class members are entitled to general damages.\nDefendants maintain that the Second Circuit’s decision in Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56,\napproving the award of nominal damages,  is an implicit rejection of the argument that the victim\nof an unlawful strip search is entitled to general damages for injury to human dignity.  The Court\ndisagrees.  There is no indication in Shain that the parties raised, or that the Second Circuit\nconsidered, whether the plaintiff was entitled to general damages for the unlawful strip search. \nRather, the question was whether that plaintiff was entitled to special damages and as to that\nquestion the Court found that the evidence was insufficient and therefore a nominal damage\naward was appropriate.  Id. at 67.  Shain does not bar general damages for unlawful strip\nsearches.  \nNor is the Court persuaded by Defendants’ argument that even if general damages are\nawardable in a strip search case there is no reason to believe that the rule would be extended to\nclass actions.  The Second Circuit has recognized, for example, that class-wide rather than\nindividual assessments of monetary relief may sometimes be appropriate in class discrimination\ncases.  See Robinson v. Metro-North, 267 F.3d 147, 161 n. 6 (2d Cir. 2001).  See also Berger v.\nIron Workers Reinforced Rodmen, Local 201, 170 F.3d 1111, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (holding\n11\n\nthat it was appropriate to presume that as a result of race discrimination those class members who\nwere experienced rodmen suffered emotional distress by having to subject themselves to an\nunnecessary training program for up to two years before being permitted to take union entrance\nexam and therefore damages award was supported and appropriate).  Moreover, “[p]roof of\naggregate monetary relief for [a] class is feasible and reasonable under various circumstance.”  3\nNewburg on Class Actions § 10:2.  As the authors of one noted treatise have stated: “In situations\nwhen aggregate proof of damages is sought to be proved on behalf of a class, no special or\nunique rules of evidence are involved; nor are any special substantive principles invoked; nor is\ndefendant’s monetary liability increased at all from what it would be if all class members\nindividually proved their monetary claims.  Courts have approved various methods of discovery\nand determining damages in class actions on the basis of classwide, rather than individualized\nproof of damages and the use of statistics and representative samples are one such method.”  Id.  \nFinally, the Second Circuit has noted that those cases in which plaintiffs are “aggrieved by a\nsingle policy of the defendants” and there is a “strong commonality of the violation and the\nharm” are “precisely the type of situation[s] for which the class action device is suited.”  In re\nVisa Check, 280 F.3d at 146.    Here, class members were aggrieved by a single, admittedly\nunlawful policy and there is a strong commonality between the strip search violation and the\nharm.  There is no reason that a jury in this case, hearing the procedures used by Defendants for\nstrip searches together with the testimony of a number of class members as to the circumstance of\nactual searches, could not determine an amount of general damages awardable to each member of\nthe class.  Concededly, care would have to be taken to ensure that the amount awarded for\ngeneral damages excludes all elements of special damages that individual class member might\n12\n\nthen pursue.  But the task, albeit difficult, is doable.  \nIn sum, the Court determines that the issue of general damages is predominate.\nD.  The Requirement of Superiority Has Been Met\nRule 23(b)(3) requires a court to consider whether a class action is superior to other\nmethods of adjudication.  To that end the court should examine “the interest of members of the\nclass in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;” “the extent and\nnature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of\nthe class;” “the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the\nparticular forum;” and “the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of the class.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  All these factors favor certification in this case.\nGiven that liability is established and the issue of general damages predominates,\nconcentrating the litigation in one forum will simplify and streamline the litigation process. As a\npracticable matter, neither joinder nor intervention is a realistic alternative.  It would appear that\nmembers of the class have little interest in individually controlling separate actions as the Court\nhas not been advised by the parties that any individual suits have been filed despite the amount of\ntime that has passed since this action was commenced.  The Court finds that Plaintiff have\nsatisfied the superiority requirement. \nConclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiffs’ motion to extend class certification to include\ndamages is hereby granted.  It should be noted that Plaintiffs are not asking this Court to select a\nparticular damages model or to certify any subclasses for special damages as to do so would be\n“premature.”   Thus, the Court has neither selected nor foreclosed any particular damages model;\n13\n\nnor has it gone beyond determining that the predominancy of general damages warrants\nextending class certification from solely liability to liability and damages. \nPlaintiffs shall submit a proposed order on notice within ten (10) days of the date hereof. \nThe parties shall appear for a conference on May 9, 2008 at 2:00 p.m.\nSO ORDERED.\nDated: Central Islip, New York\nMarch 27, 2008\n/s/____________________\nDenis R.

SO ORDERED. \nHowever, until the number of “Book and Bail” inmates, if    \nany, is determined, see footnote 3 supra, the total amount   \nof the general damages verdict against defendants may \n Footnotes \n \n1  The class definition is “all persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in Nassau County who thereafter were strip \nsearched at the Nassau County Correctional Center pursuant to defendants’ blanket policy, practice and custom which required that \n \nall arrestees be strip-searched upon admission to the facility, from May 20, 1996 until and including June 1, 1999.” (Jan. 16, 2007 \nOrder at 2.) \n \n2  In 1999, the Hon. Leonard D. Wexler of the Eastern District of New York held that Nassau County’s blanket policy of strip \nsearching all newly admitted misdemeanor and non-criminal charged detainees at the NCCC violated clearly established Fourth \n \nAmendment law. Shain v. Ellison, 53 F.Supp.2d 564 (E.D.N.Y.1999), aff’d in part and remanded in part, 273 F.3d 56 (2d \nCir.2001). Following Judge Wexler’s 1999 decision, Nassau County reported that it “had officially ended its blanket strip search \npolicy.” Shain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211, 214 (2d Cir.2004). And, as explained in the text, infra, defendants in the present case have \nconceded liability as to subject strip searches leaving solely the issue of damages to be resolved. \n \n3  All class members were necessarily strip searched given the definition of the class. However, the precise size of the class has not \nyet been determined. Although the parties agree that the non-felony admittees during the class period, and concomitant searches, \n \ntotal approximately 17,000 and 23,000 respectively, defendants contend that not all such admittees were strip searched; some, as \nthe result of the practice of “book and bail,” were released from the correctional facility after admission but prior to a strip search \nbeing conducted due to bail being posted on their behalf in the interim. (See Trial Transcript (“Tr.”) 1911:1–1912:4.) That issue is \npresently sub judice. \n \n4  Given the sensitivity of the subject matter, the Court has elected to refer to testifying class members by their first names and the \nfirst letter of their last names. \n \n \n5  Christopher W., unlike the other class members who testified, was called to the stand by the defense as part of their case. (Tr. \n1377:3–6.) \n \n \n6  The Court notes that while the lesson plan recites that the searching officer should run his fingers or a wide-tooth comb through an \ninmate’s hair, CO Pound, the author of the lesson plan, testified at his deposition that he “would never do that. [He] would never \n \nput [his] hands on an inmate. The inmate would do that.” (Pound Dep. (Court Ex. 4) at 73:7–13.) \n \n7  Neither the testifying class members nor COs were able to identify the other with respect to any particular search. NCCC has \nessentially no records to fill that void by linking a particular officer to a strip searched inmate. Accordingly, each officer testified \n \nbased on the strip search procedure he or she used during the class period, with the class members relying on their memories to \nreconstruct the details of the subject searches. \n \n8  Each stall was also 34″ wide, with the entrance being 30″ in width given a two inch lip on each side of the front opening; the depth \nof stalls were 48″. (Tr. at 807:9–14.) \n \n \n9  Parenthetically, class member Oscar A.—discussed infra in text—testified that he did not see any stalls in the room where he was \nstrip searched (Tr. at 481:21–23), even though it is uncontroverted that all male class members were strip searched in the same \n \nroom which room contained stalls. \n \n10  In so concluding, the Court has considered, and rejected as devoid of evidentiary support, the notion advanced by plaintiffs “that \nthe primary purpose ... of the strip search procedure was to inculcate submission to authority rather than seriously to search for \n \ncontraband in the bodily orifices of those being strip searched.” (Pls.’ Comments on Defs.’ Proposed Findings of Fact and \nConclusions of Law (“Pls. Comments”) at 19.) To the contrary, the purpose of the search was to see if an inmate was harboring \ncontraband on his or her person. (See e.g., Tr. at 997:3–5, 1120:24–1122:1, 1585:9–12.) \n \n11  Each of the testifying COs attended the Academy prior to 1997. \n \n\n \n   \n12  Deputy Undersheriff Donahue submitted a like Declaration fifteen months earlier in Shain, 53 F.Supp.2d 564 in which the above \nquoted language appears verbatim. (Court Ex. 2, ¶ 9.) \n \n \n13  Cpl. Jorgensen testified at deposition that a direction that an inmate lift his scrotum was “optional” (Tr. at 941:4–942:2), which \ncalls into question the legitimacy of defendants’ apparent bright line denial that such a step, as testified to by several class \n \nmembers, was part of some strip searches. \n \n14  The trial evidence on time of exposure was generally limited to the time an inmate was totally naked. Accordingly, the estimates in \nthe text are based on that evidence and not, for example, to possible subsets of that condition such as how long a female inmate’s \n \nbreasts were uncovered while other private parts of her anatomy were clothed. \n \n15  The admissibility of the 1997 Lesson Plan implicates a mixed question of fact and law. \n \n \n16  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d) indicates that an admission by a party-opponent is not deemed an “exception” to hearsay rule but rather as \nbeing “exempt” from the rule as non-hearsay. Graham, Handbook on Evidence, § 801:15. \n \n \n17  Plaintiffs also refer to Sergeant Harrs’ deposition, Court Exhibit 5, as to the purported significance of the 1997 Lesson Plan. (Pls.’ \nProp. Findings at 17–19.) \n \n \n18  The affront to human dignity occasioned by being illegally strip searched occurs each time an individual is thus victimized. \nAccordingly, given that some class members were subjected to more than one new admit strip search during the class period, the \n \ngeneral damages award shall be per strip search, not per person. \n \n19  See this Court’s March 27, 2008 Memorandum and Order regarding class certification for damage purposes (particularly the \nportion entitled “The Issue of General Damages for Dignity Harm Predominates”) which is hereby incorporated by reference; not \n \ncited in the March 27, 2008 Memorandum and Order, but nonetheless relevant vis-a-vis the distinction between general and special \ndamages is Martinez v. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 445 F.3d 158, 161 (2d Cir.2006). \nFor the Court’s analysis in applying established Second Circuit jurisprudence concerning the general damages brought about by \nthe loss of liberty necessarily inherent in a proven false arrest claim to the current unconstitutional strip search scenario, and for \ndoing so in a Fed. R. of Civ. P. 23 context, see Mar. 27, 2008 Memorandum and Order at 8–13. \n \n20  “[I]f the Court’s general damages verdict is substantial enough to provide reasonable compensation to the class, plaintiffs are \nconsidering foregoing the next stage of the compensatory damages case in an effort to move this case more expeditiously to a \n \nconclusion ....” (Pls.’ Comments at 56–57 n. 24.) \n \n21  After the conclusion of the briefing in the case at bar, the Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the S.D. Ohio’s \ndecision. See McCabe v. Parker, 608 F.3d 1068 (8th Cir.2010). Although upholding the district court decision granting a new trial \n \nand offering remittitur, the Eighth Circuit held that the remittitur amount was too low as it violated the maximum recovery rule. \n \n22  One of those cases was Tyson v. City of New York, No. 97 Civ. 3762(JSM) in which “a class of pre-arraignment detainees [reached \na settlement with the City under which] individual awards ... averag[ed] ... approximately $3,800 per person,” 233 F.R.D. at 389. \n \n \n23  City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448 (2d Cir.1974). \n \n \n24  I found that none of the six “European Court of Human Rights” cases cited by defendants (see Defs.’ Prop. Findings at 28–29) \nwere of aid to the Court. \n \n \n25  The periods of incarceration are provided in an earlier Nolley decision viz. Nolley v. County of Erie, 776 F.Supp. 715, 717 \n(W.D.N.Y.1991). \n \n \n \n  \n ",

Thus, it appears as if the Court would need to affirmatively certify a subclass or subclasses in order to \ncontinue the litigation, rather than [ ] formally decertify the class in order to bring it to a conclusion.” (Defs.’ Mem. at 2.) \n \n2  In Kerman, a jury found that the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by his unjustified detention in a psychiatric \nhospital overnight, but awarded him only nominal damages. The Second Circuit found that he was entitled to a new trial with \n \nrespect to his claim for damages due to his loss of liberty. The Circuit noted that a plaintiff is never automatically entitled to a \nsubstantial damages award simply because he has been deprived of a constitutional right. See Kerman, 374 F.3d at 122–23. But \nwhere, as in Kerman, a jury found that a constitutional violation unquestionably resulted in an injury to the plaintiff, that plaintiff \nwas entitled to an award of “compensatory, not merely nominal, damages.” Id. at 125. In its March 27, 2008 Memorandum & \nOrder, this Court saw no dispute that the unconstitutional strip searches at issue “resulted in some injury to the class members.” \n(Mar. 27, 2008 Mem. & Order at 10.) For the reasons set forth in Kerman, the Court found that “[a]t the very least, class members \nare entitled to general damages.” (Id. at 11.) \n \n\n \n \n3  Class membership is approximately 17,000; some class members were strip searched more than once, resulting in approximately \n22,000 strip searches of class members during the class period. \n \n \n4  “Garden-variety,” as used herein, is plaintiffs’ term—not the Court’s. Plaintiffs use the term to suggest a form of damages that \nhave  a  certain  degree  of  commonality,  such  that  individualized  proof  would  not  be  necessary.  In  repeating  plaintiffs’ \n \n“garden-variety” term in this Memorandum & Order, the Court does not adopt or attempt to reconvey such a suggested meaning. \n \n5  Robinson involved a motion for Rule 23(b)(2) class certification of a claim “seeking both injunctive relief and non-incidental \nmonetary damages.” 267 F.3d at 164. When discussing plaintiffs’ Title VII disparate impact claims, the Second Circuit stated that \n \nif the plaintiffs established a statutory violation, “the court may order prospective class-wide injunctive relief.” Id. at 161. The \nCircuit continued: “Still, in order for an employee to obtain individual relief (e.g., back or front pay), an inquiry similar to the \nremedial stage of a pattern-or-practice disparate treatment claim is generally required.” Id. In its March 27, 2008 Memorandum & \nOrder, this Court cited to a footnote in Robinson in which the Second Circuit stated: “Both parties correctly note that some cases \nmay require class-wide, rather than individualized assessments of monetary relief.” Id. at 161 n. 6 (collecting cases, none of which \nissued a class-wide award for emotional distress damages). The Second Circuit further noted, however, “this is the exception, not \nthe rule: Where possible, ‘there should be ... a determination on an individual basis as to which class members are entitled to \n[recovery] and the amount of such recovery.” Id. (quoting Shipes v. Trinity Indus., 987 F.2d 311, 318 (5th Cir.1993)). \n \n6  In Berger, a class of African–American ironworkers brought a race discrimination action under § 1981 and Title VII against their \nlocal and international unions. The trial court bifurcated liability and damages, and plaintiffs succeeded in proving liability at trial. \n \nBerger, 170 F.3d at 1116. The case was then referred to a Special Master who held individual trials for each class member and then \nissued a report recommending, inter alia, compensatory damages awards to the 18 remaining class members who had not already \nsettled with the defendants. Id. at 1117, 1138. The court found that “courts may properly infer emotional distress from factual \ncircumstances—and award damages to compensate for that distress—but may not presume damages from a bare violation of a \nstatutory or constitutional right.” Id. at 1138. The court then found that the “awards in the instant case are supported by the proper \nkind of inference.” Id. Importantly, those awards were rendered after individual trials held for each class member—not on a \nclass-wide basis. See id. (noting the awards ranged from $2,500 to $25,000). \n \n7  According to the docket sheet in McBean v. City of New York, 02 CV 5426 (S.D.N.Y.), a stipulation of settlement was submitted \nfor court approval a few months after the August 2009 decision cited above, and that settlement was approved by the court by \n \nOrder dated October 22, 2010. \n \n8  “The Dodge plaintiffs [sought] to represent a class consisting of all persons accused of misdemeanors who were strip searched \nupon their initial arrival at OCCF from January 31, 1999 through August 6, 2002. The Rango plaintiffs [sought] to represent a class \n \nconsisting of all persons accused of felonies who were strip searched upon their arrival at OCCF during the same period.” Dodge, \n226 F.R.D. at 179. \n \n9  According to the docket sheet in Dodge v. County of Orange, 02 CV 769 (S.D.N.Y.), the parties in both the Dodge and Rango \nactions reached settlement shortly after the class certification decision was issued. \n \n \n10  According to the docket sheet for Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 01 CV 2600 (S.D.N.Y.), the case settled and was dismissed before \nany determination as to liability was made. \n \n \n11  The cases collected by Langley dealt with awards of backpay—not emotional distress damages. “[C]alculating the amount of \nbackpay lost by  members of the class because of the employer’s discriminatory  employment practices does not require \n \nindividualized proof because the aggregate amount of backpay does not depend on the individual circumstances of any class \nmember.” United States v. City of New York, 2011 WL 2680474 at *16 (E.D.N.Y. July 8, 2011). \n \n12  The trial court noted that “although the time when each [of the deceased claimants] was last seen alive is known with reasonable \ncertainty,” there was no evidence in the record as to the exact time of their deaths. In re Moore–McCormack Linse, Inc., 184 \n \nF.Supp. 585, 590 (S.D.N.Y.1960). Accordingly, the trial court’s “estimate [of] the time of death ... is that each deceased died one \nhour after he was last seen alive....” Id. \n \n13  “Young Docket No. ––––” refers to docket entries on the electronic docket sheet for Young v. County of Cook, 06 CV 552 \n(N.D.Ill.). \n \n \n14  Cook County as well as Cook County Sheriff Michael Sheahan and Sheriff employees (collectively, “Sheriff defendants”) were \nnamed as defendants in Young. Cook County and the Sheriff defendants each moved separately for summary judgment. \n \n \n15  The Court notes that this approach would appear to have the attendant benefit of facilitating settlement, in that it would give each \nparty an idea of the verdict amounts possible. Should both parties be interested in utilizing a similar approach with an aim at \n \n\n \n  achieving settlement of the entire matter, they should inform the Court within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Order. To \ndetermine the viability of that approach, counsel for the parties are directed to meet and confer within fifteen days of the date of \nthis Order to see if such an approach is likely to promote a settlement. The initial contact for this purpose shall be made by \nAttorney Robert L. Herbst. \n \n16  The Court has considered sua sponte whether some type of statistically significant random sampling method could be utilized to \ndetermine emotional distress damages for individual class members. Such an approach does not appear viable. The main support \n \nfor such an approach would stem from the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Hilao v. Estate of Ferdinand Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 771 (9th \nCir.1996), which involved a class action seeking damages based upon human rights abuses committed by the Philippine military. \nIn the compensatory damages phase of the litigation, a statistically significant sample of the 9,541 claims were randomly selected \nand information about the individual sample claims was used to determine compensatory awards to the sub-classes of remaining \nclass members. See id. at 783. The Ninth Circuit ultimately held the “district court’s methodology” was “unorthodox” but was \n“justified by the extraordinarily unusual nature of this case.” Id. at 786. \nIn a strong dissent, Circuit Judge Rymer disagreed, emphasizing that “[e]ven in the context of a class action, individual \ncausation and individual damages must still be proved individually.” Id. Several courts have raised serious questions about the \nNinth Circuit’s conclusions in Hilao, and have agreed instead with the sentiments expressed in Judge Rymer’s dissenting \nopinion. See, e.g., Cimino v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 151 F.3d 297, 319 (5th Cir.1998) (“Finally, we find ourselves in agreement \nwith the thrust of the dissenting opinion [in Hilao ].”); In re Fibreboard Corporation, 893 F.2d 706, 707 (5th Cir.1990) \n(expressing a “profound disquiet” with trial court’s approach in managing litigation of 3,031 asbestos cases, when only “certain \nrepresentative cases” would be tried on the issues of liability and damages to a jury); The Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. \nTalisman Energy, Inc., 226 F.R.D. 456 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (“The dissent in Hilao was the better reasoned decision and identified \nthe very problems that infect this application for certification.”). \n \n17  Plaintiffs have consistently referred to special damages as encompassing claims for varying levels of emotional distress damages. \nWhile the Court recognizes that special damages could potentially include those outside the realm of emotional distress damages, \n \nplaintiffs have never raised such claims. \n \n18  In the most recent round of briefing, counsel referred the Court to arguments made as part of prior written submissions. In future \nwritten submissions, the parties may not simply incorporate past arguments by reference, but must restate those arguments so as to \n \nproperly focus the Court on the legal points they wish to make. \n \n19  Interestingly, should the Court adopt plaintiffs’ “modest proposal,” “plaintiffs would agree to forego any further trial(s) or \nproceedings with respect to emotional damages and end the case now.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 3.) \n \n \n20  See Crown, Cork & Seal Co., Inc., 462 U.S. 345, 353–54, 103 S.Ct. 2392, 76 L.Ed.2d 628 (1983) (“We conclude ... that the \ncommencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would \n \nhave been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action. Once the statute of limitations has been tolled, it \nremains tolled for all members of the putative class until class certification is denied. At that point, class members may choose to \nfile their own suits or to intervene as plaintiffs in the pending action.”) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); see also \nDefs.’ Mem. at 12 n. 5 (citing 5 Moore’s Fed. Practice—Civil § 23.65[1] [a] ). \n \n21  Plaintiffs assert that the “class plaintiffs” are entitled to pre-judgment interest running “from the date of the strip search, or, \nalternatively, the entire class is entitled to prejudgment interest from some middle ground date during the class period (e.g., \n \nDecember 1, 1997), until the entry of judgment, at the New York State statutory rate of nine percent per year.” (Pls.’ Nov. 19, 2010 \nLetter at 1.) \n \n22  Plaintiffs assert that in Green v. Torres, 98 CV 8700, a “federal civil rights action against a municipality with both federal \nconstitutional  and  state  law  claims  as here,”  following  a  jury  verdict  and  award  of  $58,508  to plaintiff,  Judge  Rakoff \n \n“supplemented the jury’s award ... with $12,594.44 in pre-judgment interest....” (Pls.’ Nov. 19, 2010 Letter at 2.) Plaintiffs, \nhowever, have failed to furnish a copy of that judgment or otherwise demonstrate that the plaintiff in Green was permitted to \nrecover pre-judgment interest on an award for exclusively emotional distress damages, as opposed to an award of back pay or lost \nwages. \n \n \n  \n ",

By Memorandum & Order dated March 27, 2008, \nthe Court found that the issue of general damages due to the asserted injury to human dignity predominated, and concluded that \n \nthere was “no reason [to believe] that a jury ... could not determine an amount of general damages awardable to each member of \nthe class.” (Mar. 27, 2008 Order at 7–12, 2008 WL 850268.) The parties waived the right to a jury trial and submitted the issue of a \ngeneral damages determination to the Court. After an eleven-day bench trial, the Court awarded general damages in the amount of \n$500 per strip search. (Sept. 22, 2010 Order, 742 F.Supp.2d 304, 331–32 (E.D.N.Y.2010).) By Memorandum & Order dated \nOctober 19, 2011, the Court held that it would not extend class certification to permit plaintiffs to pursue a class-wide award for \n“garden-variety” emotional distress damages, and concluded that emotional distress damages beyond those which are inseparable \nfrom the injury to human dignity may be awarded only on an individual, case-by-case basis. (Oct. 19, 2011 Order, 819 F.Supp.2d \n153, 161–66, 175–76 (E.D.N.Y.2011).) \n \n2  The petitioner and other detainees were instructed to remove their clothing while a corrections officer “looked at their ears, nose, \nmouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits, and other body openings.” Florence, 132 S.Ct. at 1514. The petitioner alleged that \n \n“he was required to lift his genitals, turn around, and cough in a squatting position as part of the process.” Id. \n \n3  Plaintiffs’ citation to Benjamin v. Jacobson, 172 F.3d 144 (2d Cir.1999) is inapposite. In that case, the Second Circuit dealt with \nthe effect that the enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PLRA”) had on earlier consent decrees entered into to \n \nresolve class actions brought by pretrial detainees against the City of New York. The Circuit described the applicable legal \nframework as follows: “Under the separation of powers, Congress lacks the authority to alter a finally rendered judgment ordering \nthe payment of money. On the other hand, to the extent that a court’s final judgment consists of an injunction, Congress may \nrequire alteration or termination of its future effect if the law on which the injunction was predicated has been changed.” Benjamin, \n172 F.3d at 161. Plaintiffs argue that, pursuant to this distinction articulated in Benjamin, that “judgments in actions at law for \ndamages [ ] are inherently final.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 22.) Of course, there has been no “finally rendered judgment ordering the \npayment of money” in this case, see Benjamin, 172 F.3d at 161, nor is there any statutory or Congressional action involved. The \ncases cited by plaintiffs involving settlement agreements (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 22–23) are similarly inapplicable. \n \n4  Parenthetically, during the general damages trial held during November and December 2009, class member Kevin Murray testified \nfor plaintiffs that following his arrest on “March 27, 1997,” he was placed in a “holding cell at NCCC” with “six to eight” other \n \npeople. (See Nov. 30, 2009 Trial Transcript (“Tr.”) at 171.) \n \n5  Class members Michael Fanning and Mary Beth Paden submitted declarations in opposition to the relief sought by defendants in \nwhich each estimated the time new admittees were free to leave their cells [and, thus, free to intermingle with other new admittees] \n \nwas limited to one hour daily, rather than the more extensive periods recited in the Golio Declaration. (See Sept. 28, 2012 Decl. of \nFanning at ¶ 3 and Sept. 29, 2012 Decl. of Paden at ¶ 5.) Two other class members, viz. Heidi Kane and Gregg Wills, filed \ndeclarations stating that their respective experiences upon entry to the NCCC were essentially devoid of contact with other \ninmates. (See Sept. 29, 2012 Decls. of Kane and Wills; see generally, the Sept. 29, 2012 Reply Decl. of Golio ¶¶ 9 and 10, \ndetailing, inter alia, how the experiences recited by the four class member declarants are not representative of the approximately \n17,000 class members, and is also at odds with the then operative “official Policies & Procedures of the Sheriff’s Department” \nwhich mandated that “inmates housed in ‘New Admit’ housing areas are to be afforded six hours of time out of their cells in their \nassigned housing area each day consistent with facility safety and security concerns,” citing Nassau County Sheriff’s Department \nPolicies & Procedures No. CD–08–01–02, eff. June 14, 1994 (attached as Ex. A), § X(B) at 6.) \nIncidently both Fanning and Wills, after being strip searched sometime prior to, or during the first 72 hours of confinement, \nwere placed in NCCC’s general population, unlike Kane and Paden who were not. \n \n6  As plaintiffs, in endeavoring to downplay the significance of the Golio Declaration, state: “[T]he Golio Declaration does not really \ncontravene the essential thrust of the Donahue, Gregg and Fanning Declarations and the testimony of Sheriff Jablonsky and Lt. \n \nConsidine. The fact that new admits are held in temporary cells for a short time upon entering the facility, and that when escorted \nto their own cells in the separate new admit housing facility, they may congregate in a common area for some period of time ... \ndoes not [, Plaintiffs’ argument continues,] amount to substantial contact, and hardly constitutes the sustained, prolonged and often \nunrestricted intermingled contact in general population to which Florence’s holding is cabined.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 14 (emphasis \nadded).) As stated in the text, the Court disagrees with the final conclusion drawn by Plaintiffs. \n \n7  One such circumstances presumably would entail the space and staff available in the facility at the time of the arrestee’s admission. \n \n \n8  Were the situation otherwise, perhaps it could be argued that the search at Burlington was somehow legitimized as a precondition \nto his admission to the Essex County Correctional Facility. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n9  Article I, Section 12 of the New York State Constitution provides in pertinent part: “The right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, \n \nbut upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or \nthings to be seized.” \n \n \n ",

As a result, summary judgment as to liability was entered against \n \ndefendants on behalf of the “class and each and every member thereof.” (Case No. 99 CV 2844, Docket No. 122.) \n \n3  The same two methods are also utilized under the law of the State of New York. See, e.g., Flemming v. Barnwell Nursing Home \nand Health Facilities, Inc., 56 A.D.3d 162, 165, 865 N.Y.S.2d 706 (3d Dep’t 2008), aff’d, 15 N.Y.3d 375, 912 N.Y.S.2d 504, 938 \n \nN.E.2d 937 (2010); Fiala v. Metro.

Parenthetically, \nFlemming was partially overruled on another ground by a 2011 amendment to CPLR Rule 909, as indicated in the practice \ncommentaries to that Rule. See Alexander, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s CPLR Rule 909. \n \n4  The billing records consist of (1) the time records maintained by each of the five firms participating in the representation of the \nclass, which records list the date, time expended, and nature of the service provided by each attorney or paralegal as the case may \n \nbe who worked on the case (“service provider”) (identified by his or her initials), and (2) the concomitant Declarations of \nAttorneys Herbst, Smith and Brinckerhoff which—subject to some notable exceptions to be discussed in the text, infra—provide \nthe names, together with background information, of the individual service providers. \n \n5  Notwithstanding the “in Camera Review” portion of the caption, the records were made available to defendants pursuant to a \nsubsequent court order. \n \n \n6  See p. ––––, infra. \n \n \n7  See history of the Shain litigation supra at pp. –––– – ––––. \n \n \n8  Given the dearth of information about the “interns and students,” an award for their services is not warranted. \n \n \n9  As noted earlier in the text, defendants maintain that it is unclear whether plaintiffs are billing their full hourly rates for travel to \nand from the courthouse rather than the customary fifty percent of that rate. That complaint is unaccompanied, however, by the \n \nidentity of the subject entries either by firm, date, total sum involved, or otherwise. The Court declines defendants’ implicit \ninvitation to peruse the literally thousands of billing entries to fill this specificity void in the presentation of their argument since \nthe lodestar is being computed solely as a cross-check. \n \n\n \n \n10  While Robert L. Herbst is presently Senior Counsel to the law firm of Giskan Solotaroff Anderson & Stewart LLP, prior to June \n2009, he was a senior partner in the law firm of Beldock Levine & Hoffman LLP, and prior to October 28, 2002, he was a partner \n \nin the law firm of Herbst & Greenwald LLP. (See Herbst Decl. at 1.) \n \n11  From the materials submitted, Brinckerhoff and Wang are listed above as “partners.” Moreover, reference to the websites provided \nin paragraph 4 of Brinckerhoff’s March 19, 2012 Declaration, shows that Emery, Saylor, Abady and Rosenfeld are partners as \n \nwell. Although the rates requested for the services of Morrison, and Cuti suggest their partnership status, rates alone are \ninsufficient to warrant that conclusion absent other information. Accordingly, the latter two attorneys are treated as “associates.” \n \n12  “[A] reasonable fee is an estimation of ‘what a reasonable, paying client would be willing to pay, given that such a party wishes to \nspend the minimum necessary to litigate the case effectively.’ ” In re Citigroup Inc.

Class members are entitled to be notified  penalty of perjury that, to the best of my recollection, I \nnot only of the general damages award but also of the  was strip searched at the Nassau County Correctional \nother major benefit received by class counsels on their  Center  following  my  arrest  for  a  misdemeanor  or \nbehalf, i.e. the concession of liability and the anticipated  noncriminal offense on the dates listed in Section 2, \neffect  of  that  concession  on  subsequently  commenced  above.”  That  sentence  shall  be  followed  with:  “I \nlawsuits seeking special damages.  acknowledge that Nassau County may challenge my \n   claim.” \nThe misspelled first word on the second page has been \ncorrected to read “were” and the “a” immediately before  *5  Any  objections  to  or  comments  regarding  the \nthe word “previous” has been deleted.3  proposals outlined above or the attached documents \n   shall  be  filed  on  or  before  February  3,  2012.  Any \n  replies shall be filed on or before February 10, 2012. \n(Jan. 25, 2012 Order at 4.) \nProposed Book and Bail Draft Notice (Exhibit 1)    \nBy letter dated February 3, 2012, defendants advised that \nDefendants’ comments about the proposed Book and Bail  they had “no objections to the Notice and Claim Forms \ndraft notice read in pertinent part:  proposed by the Court for ... the potential Book & Bails.” \n \n\n \n(Defs.’ Feb. 3, 2012 Letter at 1.)    \n   The Court has also changed some of the language in \nBased on the County’s representation, I viewed—and still  Section 2 sua sponte. In the proposed Book and Bail \nview—the  matter  as  resolved.  Incidentally,  however,  claim  form,  that  Section  reads:  “Below  are  listed  the \ndeletion of the subject modifier to the attestation clause  booking dates for each date of arrest for a misdemeanor or \nwould likely have an unnecessary inhibiting affect upon  non-criminal offense from May 20, 1996 through June 1, \naggrieved persons. Simply put, some members may be  1999 when you were strip-searched at the Nassau County \nunderstandably  hesitant  to  unequivocally  swear  under  Correctional  Center.”  (Emphasis  added).  Telling  the \npenalty of perjury to being strip searched upon admission  recipients of the form that they “were strip-searched” on \nto the NCCC during the class period if, for instance, their  the dates listed runs counter to the very reason that some \nexperience was a decade or so ago and this was not their  of the 17,000 believed class members were sent Book and \nsole strip search experience. To the extent their attestation  Bail notices and claims forms, i.e. to determine which of \n“to  the  best  of  [their]  recollection,”  is  arguably  those individualarrestees were not strip-searched because \n“equivocal,” the County is hard pressed to legitimately  they were released on bail prior to that part of the intake \ncomplain since (1) it provided the list of class members  process being conducted. Accordingly, Section 2 will be \nfrom its records, only later carving-out possible book and  modified by replacing the word “were” with the term \nbail exceptions to that list, and (2) more importantly, it  “may have been.” In addition, the box entitled “Value of \nhas the right to challenge the accuracy of any book and  Your  Claim”  under  Section  2  has  been  deleted  as \nbail attestation.  confusing  for  essentially  the  same  reason,  as  well  as \n   unnecessary. \nWith respect to defendants’ objection to the fourth bullet    \npoint concerning purported “legal advice” being provided  *6  Section  3  has  also  been  modified,  sua  sponte,  by \nin  the  Notice,  that  issue  was  addressed  earlier  in  inserting  “one  or  more  of”  in  the  second  sentence \nreviewing defendants’ challenges to the Non–Book and  immediately before the phrase “on the date(s) listed in \nBail Draft Notice.  Section  2,”  coupled  with  a  direction  in  Section  2  to \n   “cross-out (by putting a line through) any ‘Line # (s)’ \n  which pertain to an arrest which did not result in your \nbeing strip searched upon admission to the Nassau County \nCorrectional Center.” The reason for this modification is \nProposed Non–Book and Bail Claim Form (Exhibit 4)  that arrestees within the Book and Bail category who had \nmore than one qualifying arrest did not necessarily have \nDefendants advise that “[t]his form is acceptable subject \nthe same experience on each occasion. \nto the objections [raised and decided] on the record.” \n  \n(Defs.’ Mar. 5, 2014 Letter at 4.) \n \n  \n \nCONCLUSION \nProposed Book and Bail Claim Form (Exhibit 2)  This Memorandum and Order has been written solely to \nexplain  to  counsel  the  reasons  behind  the  major \nWhat I said earlier about defendants’ objection to the \nmodifications  to  the  proposed  forms  presented  by \nphrase  “to  the  best  of  my  recollection”  is  hereby \nplaintiffs pursuant to my direction. \nincorporated by reference.4 \n  \n  \nSO ORDERED. \nDefendants’ request that the Court add the term “upon \n  \nadmission” in the second line of “Section 3” is granted. \n \nThe  term  shall  appear  in  the  modified  claim  form \nimmediately after the word “searched.” \n Footnotes \n \n1  Forms 31 and 32 have been renumbered and re-titled such that currently, Form 70 is “Judgment on a Verdict” and Form 71 is \n“Judgement by the Court Without a Jury.” \n \n \n2  The other major items included within the proposed judgment submitted by plaintiffs which were challenged by defendants in their \nMarch 5, 2014 letter, were addressed vis-avis the subject matter involved in this Court’s Memorandum & Order dated April 2, \n \n2014 as amended on April 7, 2014. \n \n\n \n \n3  This change has also been made to page 1 of Exhibit 1. \n \n \n4  Parenthetically, the likely inhibiting affect of deleting the subject language from this claim form is even more pronounced since \nhere the class member attests to having been strip searched on a given day or days instead of sometime during the approximately \n \nthree year class period. \n \n \n ",

Hurley, Judge), denying plaintiffs’ repeated class certification motions\n32 for lack of common issue predominance.  The District Court expressed “considerable doubt” as\n33 to whether it could certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A) when it\n34 already had determined that plaintiffs’ claims as a whole failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)’s\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 2 of 21\n1 predominance requirement.  The District Court further concluded that, even if it could do so,\n2 common liability issues that defendants had conceded no longer factored into the predominance\n3 analysis.  The District Court thus denied plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class on the issue of\n4 liability.\n5 We hold that (1) district courts may certify a class on a particular issue regardless of\n6 whether plaintiffs’ claims, as a whole, satisfy the predominance test; (2) the District Court erred\n7 when it excised common liability issues from its predominance analysis due to defendants’\n8 concession; and, as a result, (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion in declining\n9 to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A).\n10 REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.\n11 _________________________________\n12 ROBERT L.

Goldin, Deputy County Attorney, on the brief), Mineola,\n23 NY, for Defendants-Appellees.\n24 _________________________________\n25 STRAUB, Circuit Judge:\n26 This appeal is the latest installment in a series of litigations over the Nassau County\n27 Correctional Center’s (“NCCC”) blanket strip search policy for newly admitted, misdemeanor\n28 detainees (“the policy”).  Plaintiffs, who were strip searched pursuant to the policy, appeal from a\n2\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 3 of 21\n1 series of orders entered in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Denis J.\n2 Hurley, Judge) denying their repeated motions for class certification on the ground that\n3 individual issues predominated over common ones.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) (requiring that\n4 “questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions\n5 affecting only individual members”).  \n6 During the course of class certification motion practice, plaintiffs requested that the\n7 District Court certify a Rule 23(b)(3) class solely on the issue of liability, as permitted by Rule\n8 23(c)(4)(A).  In response, defendants conceded their liability to plaintiffs.  The District Court\n9 denied the motion.  As an initial matter, the District Court expressed serious doubt over whether\n10 it could certify a class on the issue of liability since it already had determined that plaintiffs’\n11 claims, as a whole, failed the predominance test.  Even if it could do so, the District Court\n12 reasoned that defendants’ concession removed common liability issues from the predominance\n13 analysis.  With common liability issues so excised, the Court concluded that individual liability\n14 issues, such as the application of an affirmative defense, predominated.  The Court thus denied\n15 plaintiffs’ motions for class certification on the issue of liability.\n16 The precise issues on appeal are whether (1) a court may certify a Rule 23(b)(3) class as\n17 to a particular issue when it already has determined that the claim as a whole fails the\n18 predominance test; (2) common issues that are conceded remain part of the predominance\n19 analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion by failing to certify a class\n20 on the issue of liability.  As set forth more fully below, we hold that (1) a court may employ rule\n21 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class as to an issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies\n22 the predominance test; (2) the District Court erred when it concluded that defendants’ concession\n3\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 4 of 21\n1 eliminated liability issues from the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its\n2 allowable discretion by failing to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rules\n3 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A).  Accordingly, we reverse the District Court’s orders dated September 23,\n4 2003 and November 7, 2003 to the extent that they deny certification as to the issue of liability,\n5 and we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n6 BACKGROUND \n7 In 1999, the District Court for the Eastern District of New York held that defendants’\n8 blanket policy of strip searching newly admitted, misdemeanor detainees violated clearly\n9 established Fourth Amendment law.  See Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999),\n10 aff’d,  273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001).  Although the policy has never been formally enjoined, Shain\n11 v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2004) (vacating injunction for lack of standing), defendants\n12 assert that following the District Court’s 1999 decision, they ceased implementing it.\n13 Shortly after the District Court’s 1999 decision, plaintiffs brought three separate actions\n14 in the Eastern District of New York: Augustin v. Jablonsky, No. 99 Civ. 3126, O’Day et al. v.\n15 Nassau County Sheriff’s Department, et al., No. 99 Civ. 2844, and Iaffaldano v. County of\n16 Nassau, No. 99 Civ. 4238.  Together, plaintiffs named as defendants Nassau County, Sheriff\n17 Joseph P. Jablonsky, the Sheriff’s Department, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, the\n18 Division of Corrections, the Port Washington Police District and its chief of police, William\n19 Kilfoil, and up to 200 subordinate John and Jane Doe corrections officers.\n20 Each action alleged that plaintiffs were arrested on misdemeanor charges unrelated to\n21 weapons or drugs and thereafter strip searched, without individualized suspicion, pursuant to the\n22 policy.  Plaintiffs claimed that the strip searches violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Fourth, Fifth,\n4\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 5 of 21\n1 Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, section 12\n2 of the New York State Constitution.  They sought compensatory and punitive damages, a\n3 declaration that the policy was unconstitutional, and an injunction barring enforcement of the\n4 policy.  They also sought to maintain each litigation as a class action.\n5 In February of 2000, plaintiffs moved to consolidate all three actions and certify a unified\n6 class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3).1  Plaintiffs defined the class as follows: “[A]ll persons arrested\n7 for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been admitted to the Nassau County\n8 Correctional Center and strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion.”  In an\n9 opinion and order dated March 8, 2001, the District Court granted that branch of the motion\n10 seeking consolidation and denied that branch seeking class certification.  See Augustin v.\n11 Jabolonsky, No. 99 Civ. 3126, 2001 WL 770839 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2001). \n12 The District Court determined that plaintiffs satisfied the four requirements of\n13 numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n14 However, it denied certification for lack of common issue predominance.  The Court recognized\n15 certain common questions, namely, (1) whether defendants maintained a blanket strip search\n16 policy; (2) whether that policy was unconstitutional; and (3) whether some or all defendants may\n17 be held liable.  Nonetheless, it determined that individualized issues predominated, in particular:\n18 (1) whether subordinate Jane and John Doe defendants might escape liability in some cases\n19 because, notwithstanding the blanket policy, they had reasonable suspicion to search certain\n20 detainees; (2) the existence of proximate causation for each alleged injury; and (3) compensatory\n1Because motion practice on the question of class certification continued in various\niterations for more than four years, we describe only those aspects of the District Court’s\ndecisions that are relevant to our own.\n5\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 6 of 21\n1 and punitive damages calculations.\n2 The District Court noted the possibility of sua sponte certifying a class solely on the issue\n3 of liability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A), which allows for class certification “with respect to\n4 particular issues.”  It declined to do so because it did not wish to “undertake plaintiffs’ burden”\n5 to “craft and submit a proposal,” and because, as a legal matter, it perceived “considerable doubt\n6 as to the propriety of using Rule 23(c)(4)(A) in this fashion.”  In particular, the Court relied on\n7 Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734 (5th Cir. 1996) for the proposition that courts may not\n8 employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to single out the issue of liability for class treatment unless the “cause\n9 of action, as a whole,” first satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement.  Id. at 745 n.21\n10 (emphasis added by District Court).\n11 Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration.  They first asserted that they would no longer seek\n12 judgment against subordinate Jane and John Doe defendants.  Since that modification would\n13 render the question of liability identical for nearly all class members, plaintiffs next asserted that\n14 the Court should certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A).  They again\n15 defined the class as “all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been\n16 admitted to the [Nassau County Correctional Center] and strip searched without particularized\n17 reasonable suspicion.”\n18 In an opinion and order dated May 23, 2001, the Court agreed that plaintiffs’ forbearance\n19 of their claims against subordinate defendants “removes the possibility of individualized liability\n20 determinations.”  “To be sure,” the Court acknowledged, “the absence of individualized\n21 questions of liability militates in favor of partial certification solely on that issue.”  It\n22 nevertheless denied the motion.  \n6\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 7 of 21\n1 The District Court again noted its “concern that partial certification might not be\n2 appropriate in the first instance where the cause of action, as a whole, does not satisfy the\n3 predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).”  “Even assuming” that Rule 23(c)(4)(A) could be\n4 used in that fashion, the Court denied the motion because plaintiffs’ proposed class definition\n5 “would necessitate mini-trials just to determine class membership.”  In order to determine class\n6 membership, the Court believed, each would-be class member would have to show affirmatively\n7 that he was strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion – a criterion that the\n8 definition incorporated.  This burden was complicated by the fact that defendants claimed that\n9 they had ceased the blanket strip search policy after the Eastern District’s 1999 decision in Shain,\n10 and thereafter conducted strip searches only with particularized reasonable suspicion.\n11 In January 2003, plaintiffs renewed their motion for class certification as to liability and\n12 offered a new definition of the class as follows: “[A]ll persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-\n13 criminal offenses in Nassau County who thereafter were strip-searched at the NCCC pursuant to\n14 defendants’ blanket policy, practice and custom which required that all arrestees be strip-\n15 searched upon admission to the facility . . . .”  (alterations incorporated).  By referring only to the\n16 “blanket policy,” this new definition did not require plaintiffs to show that reasonable suspicion\n17 was absent in each case, and it excluded individuals strip searched after the 1999 Shain decision,\n18 when defendants ceased implementing the policy.  Plaintiffs also reiterated that they withdrew\n19 their claims against individual John and Jane Doe corrections officers.\n20 In response, defendants conceded “the one common issue” that in their view “might be\n21 appropriate for class certification . . . namely, whether the NCCC’s strip search policy during the\n22 class period was constitutional.”  (alterations incorporated).  Specifically, defendants recognized\n7\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 8 of 21\n1 that they “are bound by Shain under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.”  \n2 The District Court denied the renewed motion.  In an opinion and order dated September\n3 23, 2003, the Court determined that defendants’ concession removed all common liability issues\n4 from its predominance analysis.  Accordingly, the only liability issue that remained was an\n5 individual one: whether, notwithstanding the policy, some plaintiffs were searched based upon\n6 “reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.”  “With the liability issue thus\n7 circumscribed,” the Court wrote, “certification as to that issue would not serve any purpose.” \n8 Interestingly, the Court recognized that the individualized “‘reasonable suspicion inquiries’ will\n9 be de minimis” for two reasons: because defendants conceded that “such an inquiry will only be\n10 sought regarding a limited number of plaintiffs,” and because pursuant to United States v. Colon,\n11 250 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2001), reasonable suspicion must be possessed by some law\n12 enforcement officer at the time of the search and may not be retroactively imputed.\n13 Plaintiffs moved again for reconsideration on October 2, 2003.  In an opinion and order\n14 dated November 7, 2003, the District Court adhered to its earlier determinations and also\n15 concluded – for the first time – that for the same reasons informing its predominance analysis,\n16 plaintiffs failed to satisfy another one of Rule 23(b)(3)’s requirements, specifically, that the\n17 proposed class action be “superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\n18 adjudication of the controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In one last effort to “determine if its\n19 decision was in some other way improper,” the Court examined the policies of efficiency and\n20 uniformity animating Rule 23, and concluded that they did not favor certification.  The Court\n21 also noted that individual plaintiffs would have little trouble securing counsel to pursue their\n22 claims because their damages likely would be large enough to provide the necessary economic\n8\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 9 of 21\n1 incentive.\n2 The parties later reached a settlement in which defendants paid the lump sum of $350,000\n3 to the ten plaintiffs, who agreed to split the funds equally.  Plaintiffs reserved their right to appeal\n4 the District Court’s orders denying class certification, which they timely exercised.2 \n5 DISCUSSION\n6 I. Standard of Review\n7  We review the District Court’s denial of class certification for abuse of discretion. \n8 Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147, 162 (2d Cir. 2001).  However, we\n9 “review de novo the district court’s conclusions of law that informed its decision to deny class\n10 certification.”  Parker v. Time Warner Entm’t Co., 331 F.3d 13, 18 (2d Cir. 2003) (quotation\n11 marks omitted).  Further, we are “noticeably less deferential when the district court has denied\n12 class status than when it has certified a class.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted and alterations\n13 incorporated); Robinson, 267 F.3d at 162.  We note that while the application of the incorrect\n14 legal principle often necessitates reversal under the “abuse of discretion” standard, such reversal\n15 need not indicate any “abuse” by the District Court as that word is commonly understood.  See\n16 Zervos v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., 252 F.3d 163, 168-69 & nn.4-6 (2d Cir. 2001) (distinguishing\n17 among various meanings of “abuse of discretion”).  \n18 II. The Requirements and Purpose of Rule 23(b)(3)\n19\n20 In order to achieve class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs must (1) satisfy\n21 the four requirements of Rule 23(a), which are numerosity, typicality, commonality, and\n2Although these plaintiffs have settled their individual claims, they have reserved their\nright, in the event of a class settlement, to “seek or receive additional compensation for attorney’s\nfees and [their] time and effort as . . . class representative[s].”\n9\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 10 of 21\n1 adequacy of representation; (2) demonstrate that common “questions of law or fact” predominate\n2 over “any questions affecting only individual members”; and (3) establish that the class action\n3 mechanism is “superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\n4 controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\n5 As a general matter, the “Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed\n6 classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”  In re Visa\n7 Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 136 (2d Cir. 2001) (quotation marks\n8 omitted).  The Rule “encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve economies\n9 of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,\n10 without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.”  Fed. R. Civ.\n11 P. 23(b)(3) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend.\n12 In light of these purposes, we have set forth that although “a defense may arise and may\n13 affect different class members differently, [this occurrence] does not compel a finding that\n14 individual issues predominate over common ones.”  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 138 (internal\n15 quotation marks omitted).  So “long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class\n16 members together, variations in the sources and application of a defense will not automatically\n17 foreclose class certification.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted and alterations incorporated).\n18 III. The District Court Erred in Failing to Certify a Class on the Issue of Liability\n19 Pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A)\n20 As set forth more fully below, we conclude that the District Court erred by failing to\n21 certify a class on the issue of liability.3  We first conclude that, contrary to the District Court’s\n3We reach this conclusion without considering whether the District Court should have\ncertified a class as to plaintiffs’ entire claims – an issue that, as set forth more fully below, we\n10\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 11 of 21\n1 reservations, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class on a particular issue even if\n2 the action as a whole does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement.  Second, we\n3 hold that the District Court committed legal error in concluding that defendants’ concession\n4 eliminated common liability issues from Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance analysis.  Third, this\n5 error caused the District Court to exceed its allowable discretion in concluding that\n6 individualized liability issues predominated over common ones, and that the class action\n7 mechanism is not a superior litigation vehicle under these circumstances.\n8 A. A District Court May Certify a Class as to Specific Issues Regardless of\n9 Whether the Entire Claim Satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)\n10\n11 Whether a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class as to a specific issue\n12 where the entire claim does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement is a matter of\n13 first impression in this Circuit.  See Robinson, 267 F.3d at 167 n.12 (identifying question as one\n14 of first impression and declining to resolve it).  It also is a matter as to which the Circuits have\n15 split.  Id.  \n16 The Fifth Circuit has adopted a “strict application” of Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance\n17 requirement.  Id.  Under this view, “[t]he proper interpretation of the interaction between\n18 subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(4) is that a cause of action, as a whole, must satisfy the predominance\n19 requirement of (b)(3) and that (c)(4) is a housekeeping rule that allows courts to sever the\n20 common issues for a class trial.”  Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 745 n.21 (5th Cir.\n21 1996).\n22 The Ninth Circuit holds a different view.  Pursuant to that court’s precedent, “[e]ven if\nask the District Court to revisit in light of our holdings.\n11\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 12 of 21\n1 the common questions do not predominate over the individual questions so that class certification\n2 of the entire action is warranted, Rule 23 authorizes the district court in appropriate cases to\n3 isolate the common issues under Rule 23(c)(4)(A) and proceed with class treatment of these\n4 particular issues.”  Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 1996);  cf.\n5 Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 439 (4th Cir. 2003) (holding that courts may\n6 employ Rule 23(c) to certify a class as to one claim even though all of plaintiffs’ claims, taken\n7 together, do not satisfy the predominance requirement).  \n8 We agree with the Ninth Circuit’s view of the matter.  First, the plain language and\n9 structure of Rule 23 support the Ninth Circuit’s view.  Rule 23(c)(4) provides as follows:\n10 When appropriate (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a\n11 class action with respect to particular issues, or (B) a class may be\n12 divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the\n13 provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied\n14 accordingly.    \n15 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) (emphases added).\n16 As the rule’s plain language and structure establish, a court must first identify the issues\n17 potentially appropriate for certification “and . . . then” apply the other provisions of the rule, i.e.,\n18 subsection (b)(3) and its predominance analysis.  See Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439 (reasoning that\n19 the rule’s language provides this “express command” that “courts have no discretion to ignore”).\n20 Second, the Advisory Committee Notes confirm this understanding.  With respect to\n21 subsection (c)(4), the notes set forth that, “[f]or example, in a fraud or similar case the action\n22 may retain its ‘class’ character only through the adjudication of liability to the class; the members\n23 of the class may thereafter be required to come in individually and prove the amounts of their\n24 respective claims.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend. (emphasis added). \n12\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 13 of 21\n1 As the notes point out, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4) when it is the “only” way that a\n2 litigation retains its class character, i.e., when common questions predominate only as to the\n3 “particular issues” of which the provision speaks.  Further, the notes illustrate that a court may\n4 properly employ this technique to separate the issue of liability from damages.\n5 In addition, as the Fourth Circuit has noted, the Fifth Circuit’s view renders subsection\n6 (c)(4) virtually null, which contravenes the “well-settled” principle “that courts should avoid\n7 statutory interpretations that render provisions superfluous.”  State St. Bank & Trust Co. v.\n8 Salovaara, 326 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2003).  Pursuant to the Fifth Circuit’s view, “a court\n9 considering the manageability of a class action – a requirement for predominance under Rule\n10 23(b)(3)(D) – [would have] to pretend that subsection (c)(4) – a provision specifically included\n11 to make a class action more manageable – does not exist until after the manageability\n12 determination [has been] made.”  Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439.  Accordingly, “a court could only\n13 use subsection (c)(4) to manage cases that the court had already determined would be\n14 manageable without consideration of subsection (c)(4).”  Id.\n15 Finally, we note that the commentators agree that courts may use subsection (c)(4) to\n16 single out issues for class treatment when the action as a whole does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3). \n17 See 7AA Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1790 (3d ed. 2005) (stating that\n18 subsection (c)(4) “best may be used to designate appropriate classes or class issues at the\n19 certification stage” so that “the court can determine whether, as so designated, the other Rule 23\n20 requirements are satisfied”); 6 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions §\n21 18:7 (4th ed. 2002) (“Even cases which might not satisfy the predominance test when the case is\n22 viewed as a whole may sometimes be certified as a class limited to selected issues that are\n13\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 14 of 21\n1 common, under the authority of Rule 23(c)(4).”).\n2 For those reasons, we hold that a court may employ subsection (c)(4) to certify a class as\n3 to liability regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance\n4 requirement.\n5 B. The District Court Erred When It Concluded that Defendants’ Concession\n6 Eliminates Common Liability Issues from Rule 23(b)(3)’s Predominance\n7 Analysis\n8\n9 As noted above, the District Court reasoned that the major liability issues common to the\n10 class – whether defendants implemented a blanket strip search policy, and if so, whether they are\n11 liable for it – were eliminated from the predominance analysis by defendants’ concession. \n12 Whether a concession can limit the predominance analysis in that fashion also is a question of\n13 first impression.  For three reasons, we conclude that a concession does not eliminate a common\n14 issue from the predominance calculus, and that the District Court erred in holding otherwise.\n15 First, because the predominance analysis tests whether the class is a “‘sufficiently\n16 cohesive’” unit, In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 136, all factual or legal issues that are common to\n17 the class inform the analysis.  See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 621 (1997)\n18 (“Subdivisions (a) and (b) focus court attention on whether a proposed class has sufficient unity\n19 so that absent members can fairly be bound by decisions of class representatives.”).   In turn, an\n20 issue is common to the class when it is susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof.  In re Visa\n21 Check, 280 F.3d at 136 (“In order to meet the predominance requirement . . . a plaintiff must\n22 establish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof, and thus\n23 applicable to the class as a whole, predominate over those issues that are subject only to\n14\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 15 of 21\n1 individualized proof.” (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration incorporated)); see also\n2 Heerwagen v. Clear Channel Commc’ns, 435 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that “a\n3 plaintiff must show that those issues . . . subject to generalized proof outweigh those issues that\n4 are subject to individualized proof”); Moore v. PaineWebber, Inc., 306 F.3d 1247, 1252 (2d Cir.\n5 2002) (same).  That the class-wide proof comes in the form of a simple concession rather than\n6 contested evidence certainly shortens the time that the court must spend adjudicating the issue,\n7 but it does nothing to alter the fundamental cohesion of the proposed class, which is the central\n8 concern of the predominance requirement.  See 2 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg\n9 on Class Actions § 4:25 (4th ed. 2002) (“[T]he predominance test does not involve a comparison\n10 of court time needed to adjudicate common issues weighed against time needed to dispose of\n11 individual issues . . . .”); 7AA Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1778 (3d ed.\n12 2005) (“[C]lockwatching is not very helpful in ascertaining whether class-action treatment would\n13 be desirable in a particular case.”).  Similarly, the fact that an issue is conceded or otherwise\n14 resolved does not mean that it ceases to be an “issue” for the purposes of predominance analysis. \n15 Even resolved questions continue to implicate the “common nucleus of operative facts and\n16 issues” with which the predominance inquiry is concerned.  See Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v.\n17 Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir. 2000) (“[T]he fact that an issue has been resolved on\n18 summary judgment does not remove it from the predominance calculus.”).  Just as much as do\n19 contested issues, resolved issues bear on the key question that the analysis seeks to answer:\n20 whether the class is a legally coherent unit of representation by which absent class members may\n21 fairly be bound. \n22 Second, Rule 23 seeks greater efficiency via collective adjudication and, relatedly, greater\n15\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 16 of 21\n1 uniformity of decision as to similarly situated parties.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) adv. comm. n.\n2 to 1966 amend.  For these reasons we have written that when plaintiffs are “allegedly aggrieved\n3 by a single policy of defendants,” such as the blanket policy at issue here, the case presents\n4 “precisely the type of situation for which the class action device is suited” since many nearly\n5 identical litigations can be adjudicated in unison.  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 146.  \n6 Eliminating conceded issues from Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance calculus would\n7 undermine the goal of efficiency by requiring plaintiffs who share a “commonality of the\n8 violation and the harm,” nonetheless to pursue separate and potentially numerous actions\n9 because, ironically, liability is so clear.  Id. (noting that class action management “problems pale\n10 in comparison to the burden on the courts that would result from trying the cases individually”). \n11 Such a result also undermines the goal of uniformity by creating the risk of inconsistent decisions\n12 through the repeated litigation of the same question; here, for example, each individual plaintiff\n13 would have to establish anew that defendants were collaterally estopped by their prior concession\n14 and, if not, that defendants were liable on the merits.  Cf. Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc., 208 F.3d\n15 at 299 (concluding that because certification was “necessary to determine whether the prior\n16 resolution carries res judicata effect with respect to purported class members,” the district court\n17 properly took account of “the common nucleus of operative facts and issues, even though certain\n18 of these already had been resolved”).  Although defendants have conceded liability to these\n19 plaintiffs, there is no guarantee that they would concede liability in a case or series of cases\n20 involving significantly higher damages.  Further, courts might differ as to whether, in light of the\n21 settlement, the requirements of collateral estoppel were met, specifically, whether the issue of\n22 liability was “actually litigated and decided” and whether its “resolution  . . . was necessary to\n16\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 17 of 21\n1 support a valid and final judgment on the merits.”  Ball v. A.O. Smith Corp., 451 F.3d 66, 69 (2d\n2 Cir. 2006); cf. In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 429 F.3d 370, 387 n.15 (2d Cir. 2005)\n3 (“[I]t is clearly a permissible byproduct of settlement that future hypothetical plaintiffs might be\n4 forced to relitigate the same issues involved in the settled cases.”); Marvel Characters, Inc. v.\n5 Simon, 310 F.3d 280, 289 (2d Cir. 2002).\n6 Finally, we find further support for our view in the specific circumstances of this case. \n7 Defendants possess, but have not disclosed, records of all the newly-admitted misdemeanor\n8 detainees strip searched pursuant to the blanket policy.  Absent class certification and its\n9 attendant class-wide notice procedures, most of these individuals – who potentially number in the\n10 thousands – likely never will know that defendants violated their clearly established\n11 constitutional rights, and thus never will be able to vindicate those rights.  As a practical matter,\n12 then, without use of the class action mechanism, individuals harmed by defendants’ policy and\n13 practice may lack an effective remedy altogether.  Cf. Deposit Guar. Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445\n14 U.S. 326, 339 (1980) (noting that in certain cases “aggrieved persons may be without any\n15 effective redress unless they may employ the class-action device”); Tardiff v. Knox County, 365\n16 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (“[F]or most strip search claimants, class status here is not only the\n17 superior means, but probably the only feasible one (one-way collateral estoppel aside), to\n18 establish liability and perhaps damages.”).  Further, if defendants may utilize their concession to\n19 defeat class certification, it would work the perverse result of allowing them to escape the cost of\n20 their unconstitutional behavior precisely because their liability is too plain to be denied.  No\n21 other court has sanctioned such a result; nor shall we.\n22 Accordingly, we hold that defendants’ concession of liability does not eliminate that\n17\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 18 of 21\n1 otherwise common issue from Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance analysis, and the District Court\n2 erred when it concluded to the contrary.\n3 C. The District Court Erred in Determining that, as to Liability, Individual Issues\n4 Predominated\n5\n6 As we have established, the District Court was (1) free to certify a class on the issue of\n7 liability notwithstanding its conclusion that the action as a whole did not satisfy the\n8 predominance requirement and (2) required to consider conceded common liability issues in its\n9 predominance analysis.  We now apply these principles to the District Court’s opinion and order\n10 dated September 23, 2003 in which it denied certification on the issue of liability, as well as that\n11 dated November 7, 2003 in which it adhered to its September decision.  The class definition at\n12 issue was as follows: “[A]ll persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in\n13 Nassau County who thereafter were strip-searched at the NCCC pursuant to defendants’ blanket\n14 policy, practice and custom which required that all arrestees be strip-searched upon admission to\n15 the facility . . . .”  (alterations incorporated).  \n16 As noted, that definition obviated the need for individualized proceedings to determine\n17 class membership.  The definition referenced only defendants’ “blanket policy,” thus avoiding\n18 questions of probable cause and excluding individuals strip searched after the policy’s cessation.\n19 Since defendants possess records of misdemeanor detainees strip searched during the policy\n20 period, determining class membership would be simple.  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 142\n21 (approving class certification where “class members . . . can be identified by defendants’ own\n22 records”).\n23 The class definition also implicated two broad common liability issues: whether the\n18\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 19 of 21\n1 blanket policy existed and whether defendants are liable for its implementation.  The only\n2 countervailing, individualized liability issue was whether, regardless of the policy, some\n3 plaintiffs were strip searched based upon “reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.” \n4 The existence of this defense does “not . . . foreclose class certification.”  Id. at 138 (internal\n5 quotation marks omitted).  Further, as the District Court recognized, “any such ‘reasonable\n6 suspicion inquiries’ will be de minimis”; indeed, defendants set forth that “such an inquiry will\n7 only be sought regarding a limited number of plaintiffs.”  In light of the pervasive character of\n8 the common liability issues and the admittedly de minimis nature of individualized liability\n9 issues, we conclude that the District Court erred by holding that individual liability issues\n10 predominated over common ones in its decisions dated September 23, 2003, and November 7,\n11 2003.\n12 D. The District Court Erred in Concluding that the Class Action Device Is Not a\n13 Superior Litigation Mechanism\n14\n15 For Rule 23(b)(3) certification to be proper, a class action also must be the most “fair and\n16 efficient” method of resolving this case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In analyzing that question,\n17 courts must consider four nonexclusive factors: (1) the interest of the class members in\n18 maintaining separate actions; (2) “the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the\n19 controversy already commenced by or against members of the class”; (3) “the desirability or\n20 undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum”; and (4) “the\n21 difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.”  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n22 23(b)(3).  Contrary to the District Court’s conclusion in its decision dated November 7, 2003, all\n23 of these factors – as well as the reasons set forth above regarding efficiency and fairness – favor\n19\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 20 of 21\n1 class certification.\n2 First, the class members have little interest in maintaining separate actions since there\n3 already exists a concession of liability in this action and, without class notification, most putative\n4 class members will not even know that they suffered a violation of their constitutional rights. \n5 Second, this action already has progressed substantially and, again, offers the benefit of a liability\n6 phase that can be resolved quickly and conclusively.  Third, concentrating the litigation in one\n7 forum simplifies and streamlines the litigation process.  Fourth, we perceive little difficulty in\n8 managing a class action on the issue of liability, especially since the District Court already has\n9 noted that any individualized inquiries will be few and far between.  Accordingly, we conclude\n10 that the District Court erred in holding that a class action was not the most fair and efficient\n11 litigation vehicle under these circumstances.\n12 CONCLUSION\n13 We hold that (1) district courts may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class on a\n14 designated issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies the predominance test; (2)\n15 conceded common issues remain part of the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court\n16 exceeded its allowable discretion in denying Rule 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A) class certification on the\n17 issue of liability in its decisions dated September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003.4\n4Because we have found that certification as to liability is proper pursuant to Rule\n23(b)(3), there is “no necessity” of addressing alternate grounds for certification, such as Rule\n23(b)(2), that the District Court rejected.  Cf. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 147 (declining to\nreview district court’s ruling on Rule 23(b)(2) certification after concluding that Rule 23(b)(3)\ncertification was proper) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, since we base our decision\non the September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003 orders, we need not consider the District\nCourt’s August 20, 2004 order, in which it rejected a radically different class definition for\nfailure to satisfy Rule 23(a).  \n20\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 51-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 21 of 21\n1 In light of our direction to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to the definition\n2 set forth in the September 23 decision, we also instruct the District Court to consider anew\n3 whether to certify a class as to damages as well.  The District Court should bear in mind that\n4 “[t]here are a number of management tools available to a district court to address any\n5 individualized damages issues,” such as bifurcation, the use of a magistrate or special master,\n6 alteration of the class definition, the creation of subclasses, or even decertification after a finding\n7 of liability.  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 141.  \n8 In sum, we remand to the District Court with instructions to certify a class as to liability\n9 and consider certifying a damages class as well.\n21",

Defendants persist with the kinds of meritless arguments that \nfor years have delayed resolution of this matter.  Contrary to basic notions of fairness, defendants \noriginally manipulated their admission of liability into a justification for denial of class \ncertification.  The Second Circuit exposed their manipulation, refusing to deny certification \nsimply because \"liability is so clear\" as to be conceded.  In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, \n461 F.3d 219, 228 (2d Cir. 2006). \nIronically, defendants now attempt to leverage mandated liability class certification to \nblock meaningful relief to the class.  In so doing, first, they ignore the Second Circuit's \nsuggestion of class-wide damages resolution and misrepresent the practical implications of \ninstead relegating the determination of damages to thousands of individual actions.  In reality, \nsuch an outcome would leave the vast majority of class members uncompensated, and the \nDistrict Court, as well as Nassau County, inundated with thousands of largely repetitive \nindividual trials and fee applications, in violation of Rule 23(b )(3).1 \nSecond, defendants distort the legal implications ofthe Second Circuit's decision by \nassessing damages certification in a vacuum, apart from the established liability class.  Because \nthe extension of class certification to damages would transform this entire action into a class \naction, Rule 23(c)(4)(A) no longer applies.  Accordingly, the District Court should conduct a \nThe argument that denial of class certification on damages would expose the judiciary to a flood \nI \nof individual claims that could be handled more effectively in the aggregate is not inconsistent \nwith the concern that it would also deprive the vast majority of liability class members of access \nto relief.  Even if only 10% of the class members were to pursue individual claims, the district \ncourt would face roughly 2,300 actions. \n1 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 3 of 12\npredominance analysis of the action as whole, factoring in both the common liability and \ncommon damages issues, the latter ofwruch are much more prevalent than defendants admit. \nOn these grounds, plaintiffs urge the District Court to certify a class for this entire action \nin accordance with the Second Circuit's August 24,2006 decision. \nII.  DENIAL OF CERTIFICATION WOULD CONTRADICT PURPOSES OF RULE 23 \nThe Second Circuit decision relied on principles of faimess and efficiency to conclude \nthat the class action device is a superior litigation mechanism for addressing liability issues in \nthis case.  Nassau County, 461 F.3d at 230.  Applying the same principles, the court in Tardiffv. \nKnox County granted class certification on both liability and damages claims in a strip search \naction.  See 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st't Cir. 2004).  Like plaintiffs, the Tardiff court reasoned that \"the \nvast majority of claims would never be brought unless aggregated.\" Id. \nDefendants dismiss such concems as mere sentiment that \"cannot overcome the legal \nrequirements of the Rule [23] itself,\" as well as on practical grounds.  Defs.' Br. at 13-14. \nHowever, they are remiss in assuming that the availability of attorney's fees, notice of liability \ncertification, and res judicata on liability would translate into adequate, let alone uniform, access \nto the courts for the vast majority of plaintiffs entitled to damages.2  First, most plaintiffs are \nunlikely to seek individual representation, even ifthere were attorneys willing to represent them.3 \nDefendants attribute to plaintiffs' counsel an envisioned \"average damages award of$10,000 \n2 \nper claimant\" and claim that it is inconsistent with our concern that most liability class members \nwould not pursue relatively low damages on their own.  Defs.' Opp. at 13-14.  Defendants take \nout of context what plaintiffs' memorandum oflaw makes plain - that we invoked a hypothetical \nmonetary value to illustrate a tier-system approach to class damages resolution, with no intention \nof predicting the actual value of damages in these papers.  Pis.' Mem. at 10. \nPlaintiffs question whether defendants would oppose certification if they truly believed that a \n3 \nsignificant number of plaintiffs would litigate individually against them for damages and \n2 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 4 of 12\nSecond, defendants forget that Rule 23(b )(3) explicitly mandates the consideration of fairness \nand efficiency.  Most plaintiffs have similar claims for damages that can be resolved uniformly in \nthe aggregate, see Part III infra, so SUbjecting them to actions before different judges and juries \nwould undermine the \"goal of uniformity\" that the Second Circuit has clearly embraced.  Nassau \nCounty, 461 F.3d at 228.  Third, Part III demonstrates that plaintiffs' request for class \ncertification is well grounded in the predominance requirement of Rule 23.  Because common \nquestions predominate over individual ones, certification would be fair and efficient. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CLASS SATISFIES THE RULE 23 PREDOMINANCE TEST \nThe language and logic of the Second Circuit's decision counsel the District Court to hold \nthat common issues predominate over individualizcd ones, whether the damages claims are \nviewed separately under Rule 23(c)(4)(A) or together with the liability claims in the context of \nthis entire action IDlder a standard Rule 23(b)(3) approach.  With that said, as defendants predict, \nplaintiffs contend that this Court must take the latter approach.  Defs.' Opp. at 6 n.3.  Partial \ncertification is not applicable now that the Circuit has ordered the creation of a liability class \nbecause certification of the damages claims would convert this entire action into a class. \nThe Second Circuit's understanding of the predominance test implicitly calls for class \ncertification of this entire action, just as it explicitly justified reversal of the District Court's \nliability certification ruling.  The Circuit stated that the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance test is met, \neven if \"a defense may arise and may affect different class members differently, ... [s Jo long as a \nsufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together .... \"  Nassau County, \n461 F.3d at 225 (internal citation and quotations omitted).  Accordingly, recognizing the presence \nattorney's fees. \n3 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 5 of 12\nof \"two broad common liability issues,\" albeit conceded, the Court directed class certification on \nliability despite the existence of individualized liability issues stemming from defendants' \nreasonable suspicion defense.  Id. at 229-30.  The same rationale should counsel the District \nCourt to certify a class on all claims in this action despite the existence of some individualized \nemotional distress damages. \nMore specifically, viewing plaintiffs' claims in their entirety, the Second Circuit's finding \nthat common liability issues predominate over individual liability issues acttmlly changes the \nmath behind the District Court's overall predominance analysis.  What the District Court \nconcluded  that, because liability does not present a question to be adjudicated, and \"[w   ]hat \nremains principally for adjudication are individual compensatory damages issues ... , class \nquestions do not 'predominate over questions affecting only individual members, \", Mem. & \nOrder (Nov. 7,2003) at 5-6 (internal citation omitted) - must now be revisited under the Second \nCircuit's ruling.  The Circuit was clear that defendants' concession of liability \"does not \neliminate [liability as] a common issue from the predominance calculus, and that the District \nCourt erred in holding otherwise.\" Nassau County, 461 F.3d at 227.  Thus, conceded common \nliability issues, including whether the blanket policy existed and whether defendants are liable for \nits implementation, must now factor into the predominance analysis. \nThe common liability issues, together with the common damages issues, plainly outweigh \nthe de minimis individualized liability issues as well as the mental distress claims.  See Nassau \nCounty, 461 F.3d at 229.  This action consists of significant common damages questions that can \nbe resolved on a class-wide basis.  Because defendants have conceded the use of an \nunconstitutional blanket strip search policy to which all plaintiffs were subjected, in all \n4 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 6 of 12\nlikelihood, plaintiff..~ commonly suffered injury to human dignity.  As a result, at a minimum, \nthey are all entitled to some uniform amount of compensatory damages, as well as punitive \ndamages.  \"[P]unitive damages issues easily qualify as common issues for class treatment in a \nRule 23(b)(3) voluntary class.\"  Sala v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., 1988 WL 84125 at * \n1 (B.D. Pa. Aug. 4, 1988) (internal citation omitted).  Plaintiffs entitled to special, individualized \ndamages are likely to be in the minority.  Thus, even assuming consideration of a damages class \nthrough the lens of23(c)(4)(A), common damages issues predominate over individualized ones. \nOther cases demonstrate that common damages can be ascertained in a class-wide strip \nsearch action and that efficient mechanisms exist to address the remaining variable damages.  For \ninstance, parties have agreed that class members who present without claims of \"special injury\" \nare entitled to a benchmark amount of damages, obviating the need for the kind of detailed \ninquiry that individual damages trials would entai1.  See, e.g., Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 7.  Moreover, \nas the court noted in Tardiff, a separate mechanism, such as the use of a special master, could be \nemployed \"to determine the (potentially few) serious claims to special injury.\"  Id. \nThe Second Circuit has previously stressed that the question for the purposes of \ndetermining predominance is not whether individual damages issues  but whether they \npredominate over the common issues.  See Visa Check, 280 F.3d 124, 138 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"[i]f \ndefendants' argument (that the requirement of individualized proof on the question of damages is \nin itself sufficient to preclude class treatment) were uncritically accepted, there would be little if \nany place for the class action device ....) ; see also 1 Newberg & Conte, Newberg on Class \nActions § 3.16 (4th ed. 2002) (footnotes omitted) (classes raising common liability issues should \nbe certified \"even where the amounts of damages claimed var[yJ among class members.\"); \n5 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 7 of 12\nTardiff, 365 F.3d at 6 (affirming certification in a strip search class action with individualized \ndamages issues).  Though individual issues may exist in this action, it can nonetheless be \ncertified effectively because common issues predominate.4 \nFurther, in light of the Second Circuit's ruling, the District Court should find that the \ncases defendants rely on do not support denial of certification here.  Defendants concede that \nJudge McMahon's holding in Franklin v. County of Dutchess, 225 F.R.D. 487 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) \n\"on partial certification of a liability class has of course been superseded by the Circuit's ruling \nin this case,\" but erroneously maintain that \"her reasons for declining to certify a class as to \ndamages remain compelling.\" Defs.' Opp. at 7-8.  They again fail to perceive that common \nliability issues - whether disputed or not  must remain part of the predominance calculus. \nJudge McMahon wrongly determined that class certification would serve no purpose because \n\"defendants' liability appears to be a foregone conclusion\" and therefore the only \"disputed \nissues left to try are the inherently individualized issues ....\"   225 F.R.D. at 491.  As explained \nabove, since she was wrong on liability, her entire analysis fails. \nThe District Court should also decline to follow Judge McMahon's example in Dodge v. \nCounty of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), where she unjustifiably denied class \ncertification on damages in contravention of Rule 23, as well as Second Circuit law.  Rule \nDefendants' contention that the denial of class certification for damages in this case is \n4 \nsupported by the Second Circuit's citation to the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 23(c)(4)(A) \nis inapplicable for two reasons.  See Defs.' Opp. at 3-4.  First, these notes suggest that, in a fraud \ncase, it may be appropriate to certify a class only as to liability gthe character of the class cannot \nbe maintained into the damages phase.  However, as detailed above, class character is maintained \nthroughout this action because common issues predominate over individualized ones.  Second, \nand relatedly, these Advisory Committee Notes pertain to partial certification, which is no longer \napplicable in this case.  The Second Circuit in Nassau County invoked them in the context of \npartial certification - when it was still appropriate.  See 461 F .3d at 226. \n6 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 8 of 12\n23(b )(3) considers whether common questions predominate in the action as a whole.  Without \nfirst evaluating the ratio of common issues to individualized damages issues in the entire action, \nJudge McMahon looked narrowly to whether \"individualized questions dominate the issue of \ndamages.\"  226 F.R.D. at 183 (emphasis supplied).  However, as a matter of logic, Rule \n23(c)(4)(A) should not be used to preclude complete certification when it is appropriate under a \nbroader analysis, as in the case at hand.  Moreover, the fact that Dodge ultimately settled on a \nclass-wide basis suggests that any individualized issues were indeed susceptible to class-wide \nmanagement.  Dodge v. County of Orange, 02-CV-769 (CM) (S.D.N.Y.). \nIn Maneely v. City of Newburgh, also a strip search case, Judge McMahon admitted that \n\"[ d]istrict court judges have disagreed about whether to certify classes in cases with facts similar \nto this one\" and that \"[a] number of courts have granted class certifieation.\"  208 F.R.D. 69, 77 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2002).  In particular, she discussed Visa Check, where the Second Circuit approved a \nclass on liability and damages despite the presence of individualized damages issues.  See id. \nJudge McMahon declined to follow Visa Check for reasons not applicable here.  See id. at 77-78. \nUnlike the Maneely plaintiffs, but like the plaintiffs in Visa Check, plaintiffs here will be able to \nanalyze the categorical data on over 23,000 class members to streamline the damages issues for \nthe District Court, and use the same data to establish class membership.  Accordingly, the \nDistrict Court should be mindful of the words of the Seeond Circuit: \"While ... di fficulties in \nmanaging this large class action may arise, these problems pale in comparison to the burden on \nthe courts that would result from trying the cases individually.\" Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 146. \nJudge McMahon never confronted the chaos of thousands of individual damages actions because \nManeelyalso settled on a class-wide basis.  01-CV-02600 (CLB) (MDF) (S.D.N.Y.). \n7 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 9 of 12\nInstead of drawing attention to Visa Check, defendants mischaracterize the Second \nCircuit's holding in Robinson v. Metro North Commuter Railroad Co., 267 F.3d 147 (2d CiI. \n2001), as well as the holdings of strip search cases in other circuits.  The Robinson court never \nmade the distinction between damages and liability that defendants imagine.  In fact, much like \nthe Second Circuit in Nassau County, the Robinson court also instmcted the district to reconsider \ncertification of the entire action, even in the presence of compensatory and other non-incidental \ndamages issues.  Robinson, 267 F.3d at 164, 167. \nIn addition, despite defendants' contentions to the contrary, the holdings in Tardiff, and \nMack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000), strongly support certification ofa class \non the entire action at hand.  In Tardiff, the First Circuit approved a class on all claims in a strip \nsearch case despite the need for individualized damages decisions, reasoning that the court would \nhave practical options for addressing damages.  365 F.3d at 7; see also supra.  The District Court \nhere has the same options at its disposal. \nSimilarly, in Mack, the court certified a class of strip search victims on both liability and \ndamages claims, reserving the options of \"subclasses or, at worst, decertitying the class\" if \nproblems arose.  191 F.R.D. at 25.  Again, this District Court maintains the same safety valves. \nHowever, it would be premature to deny certification before attempting to provide broad relief \nvia the class action mechanism.  After all, the Mack court, like Judge McMahon in the above \ncases, ultimately succeeded in distributing damages on a class-wide basis.  See Plfs.' Mem. at 9. \nIV.  CLASS-WIDE DAMAGES ADJUDICATION WOULD BE FAIR AND EFFICIENT \nDespite their admitted culpability in violating plaintiffs' rights, defendants are quick to \n8 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 10 of 12\ndismiss the instructive value of eases in which class-wide damages were resolved via settlement. \nSee Defs.' Opp. at 14-15.  However, other courts have made clear that settlement is an \nappropriate class management consideration.  Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 7 (approved class on \n=-'::-::.L.::.:.Q;.' \nentire action, reasoning that, \"if and when liability is established and the remaining dispute is \nonly the amount of damages, it is common experience that a great many claims settle.\"). \nDefendants may become less cavalier about their culpability if confronted with a damages class. \nIf settlement ultimately proves infeasible, the District Court will have the opportunity to \nmaximize efficiency by seeking feedback from both plaintiffs and defendants regarding effective \nmanagement tools for class-wide resolution of damages - per the Second Circuit's mandate.5 \nConcluding now that the class should not be certified for damages is entirely premature. \nDefendants suggest that the damages distribution model approved in Hilao v. Marcos, \n103 F.3d 767 (9th Cir. 1996) raises due process concerns in the less \"extraordinary\" context of \nthis case.  They are incorrect.  To determine whether the model afforded defendant adequate due \nprocess in Hilao, the court weighed its effects on the defendant's interest against plaintiffs' \ninterest in the procedure, with \"principal attention\" to the latter.  103 F.3d at 786.  Plaintiffs' \ninterest, like that of the Hilao class members, \"is enormous, since adversarial resolution of each \nAs defendants concede, the Second Circuit encouraged the District to consider a number of \n5 \nmanagement tools.  Nassau County, 461 F.3d at 231.  Defendants highlight that the Circuit \nidentified \"decertification after a finding ofliability\" as one of these tools.  Defs.' Opp. at 2. \nHowever, the Circuit listed decertification as the last of five tools - four of which can be used to \nmaintain a damages class - with a direct citation only to  461 F .3d at 231.  In Visa \nCheck, the Second Circuit recognized decertification as a last resort.  280 F 3d at 141 (\"the \n[lower] court specifically recognized its ability to modifY its class certification order, sever \nliability and damages, or even decertify the class if such an action ultimately became necessary.\") \n(emphasis supplied). \n9 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 11 of 12\nclass member's claim would pose insurmountable practical hurdles.\"  Id.  The Hilao court also \nrecognized the judiciary's substantial ancillary interest in avoiding \"individual adversarial \ndeterminations of claim validity [that] would clog the docket of the district court for ... years.\" \nId. at 786-87.  In contrast, defendants merely have an interest in the total amount of damages. \nSee id. at 787.  Thus, defendants' due process concerns are misplaced. \nFinally, defendants baselessly contend that a sampling methodology is not appropriate \nhere because plaintiffs' injuries vary more widely than those of the class members in Hilao.  As \nunderscored in Part III supra, all of the plaintiffs in this action are likely to suffer from injury to \nhuman dignity due to a blanket strip search policy, which should entitle them to common \ncompensatory damages, as well as punitive damages.  If anything, the Hilao class members \nendured a greater variety of injuries because they were subjected to a range of torture methods. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nAfter nearly a decade of litigation, this case is at a crossroads.  The District Court \npossesses the legal and moral authority to provide - through complete class certification  relief \nfor thousands of plaintiffs who will not otherwise obtain damages.  The alternative is to allow the \ndefendants to continue stonewalling plaintiffs' access to justice and allow them, after admitting \nliability, to bear no meaningful consequences to their longstanding unconstitutional policy. \nGiven that the purpose of Section 1983 is not only to compensate civil rights victims, but also to \ndeter future unconstitutional conduct, Careyv. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247,256-57 (1978), this Court \nshould grant certification on this entire action without significant further delay and provide such \nother and further relief to plaintiffs which it deems just and proper. \n10 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 58      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 12 of 12\nDate:  New York, New York \nMarch 1, 2007 \nRespectfully submitted, \nJonathan C.

The PLRA’s Limitation of Recovery Is \nThe Court is aware that its conclusion is contrary to the  Inapplicable to Individual Class Members Where the \ndecision  in  Cox  v.  Malone,  199  F.Supp.2d  135  Named Plaintiffs Were Not Incarcerated When the \n(S.D.N.Y.2002), aff’d, 56 Fed. Appx. 43 (2d Cir2003).

Nor does this Court find it  when  the  complaints  in  these  actions  were  filed.  The \npersuasive.

According  to  the  Cox  court,  §  exhaustion requirement vis a vis class actions and are \n1997e(e)’s  “purpose  is  accomplished  whether  section  distinguishable  on  that  ground.  Indeed,  given  that \n1997e(e)  is  applied  to  suits  brought  by  inmates  exhaustion  allows  prison  officials  an  opportunity  to \nincarcerated at the time of filing or by former inmates  address the merits of a claim and that requiring all class \nincarcerated  at  the  time  of  the  alleged  injury  but  members to exhaust could unduly burden a complaint \nsubsequently released.

In  both  cases  the  courts  merely  state  a \nthe requirement of adequacy of representation contained  conclusion without any analysis. See Phipps v. Sheriff of \nin  Rule  23  of  Federal  Rules  of  Civil Procedure.  The  Cook County, 681 F.Supp.2d 899 (N.D.

Having previously found that the named plaintiffs  plaintiff was a prisoner the PLRA would not preclude \nhad commenced the action after their incarceration and  their claims “or the claims of other class members who \nthat § 1997e(e)’s limitation did not apply to them, the  were  not  incarcerated”);  Malone  v.  Becher,  2003  WL \nKelsey Court reasoned that “[i]t follows that no other  22080737,  *1  (S.D.Ind.  Aug.  29,  2003)  (stating  that \npotential class members commenced this suit, although  claims  “would  be  subject  to  the  physical  injury \nthey  may  join  the  class.

The Kelsey court’s reference to class  recovery  does  not  apply  where,  as  here,  none  of  the \nmembers “joining” is unfortunate as Rule 23 class actions  named  plaintiffs  who  brought  the  class  action  were \nare not “opt-in” actions which potential plaintiffs “join”  incarcerated at the time the action was commenced. Given \nbut rather “opt-out” actions in which class members must  this conclusion it is unnecessary for the Court to address \naffirmatively exclude themselves. Nonetheless, this Court  whether general damages for the harm to human dignity \nreaches the same conclusion as Kelsey.  are damages for “mental or emotional injuries” under the \n   PLRA. \nAs  discussed  earlier,  Congress’  focus  in  enacting  the    \nPLRA  was  not  all  claims  arising  during  a  plaintiff’s   \nincarceration  but  rather  only  actions  brought  by \nincarcerated  persons.  As  a  result,  the  PLRA’s \napplicability depends on the whether the plaintiff brings  Conclusion \nthe action while incarcerated or free. Thus, holding that \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court holds that the \nthe PLRA’s recovery limitation depends on the named \nrecovery limitation of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of \nclass  action  plaintiffs’  incarceration  status  is  not \n1997 (“PLRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), is inapplicable to \nrepugnant to the PLRA’s purpose. Moreover, the instant \nthe present case. \nactions were “brought” by the named plaintiffs albeit on \n  \nbehalf of others similarly situated; they were not brought \nSO ORDERED. \nby the unnamed class members. Thus, under the literal \n  \nlanguage  of  the  PLRA,  its  limitation  on  recovery  on \n \napplies to actions “brought” by an incarcerated person. \n Footnotes \n \n1  By Memorandum and Order dated November 19, 2009, the Court held that defendants had waived any affirmative defense of \nexhaustion under the PLRA. \n \n \n2  The parties waived the right to a jury trial on the issue of general damages. \n \n \n3  The PLRA defines a prisoner as “any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, \nor adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or \n \ndiversionary program.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(h). \n \n4  The Court recognizes that the PLRA limits recovery in actions by “a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional \nfacility,” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) (emphasis added), and not to prisoners confined in medical facilities or mental institutions, see \n \nPerez v. Westchester Cnty Dept. of Corrections, 587 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir.2009). That distinction does not appear relevant for \npresent purposes and therefore the Court shall simply refer to prisoner(s) or plaintiff(s) who are incarcerated. \n \n5  Defendants make no claim that any of the named plaintiffs were incarcerated at the time these actions were filed. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n ",

In re Nassau County Strip Search\nCases, 461 F.3d 219, 231 (2d Cir. 2006).  As set forth below, now that a class has been\ncertified on the common and conceded issue of liability (and the class members thus\nafforded notice of the liability judgment), the remaining issues of damages clearly do not\nsatisfy the predominance test of Rule 23 (b) (3).\nPer this court’s Individual Practice Rule 2.I, defendants respectfully request oral\nargument of this matter.\nA. The Language and Logic of the Second Circuits’s \nDecision Do Not Support Damages Class Certification.\nAs a preliminary matter, one can dispense quickly with plaintiffs’ wishful sugges-\ntion that “the Court of Appeals made patent its view that certification appears to be just as\nappropriate  . . .  for damages as  . . .  for liability.”  Pls’ Mem. Law at 4.  Of course, when\nthe Court of Appeals wishes to make “patent its view” on an issue of law before it, it\nknows how to do so expressly, as it has done here on the issue of liability class certifica-\ntion.  On the other hand, when the Court remands an issue for reconsideration  after\nclarifying other issues in a case, as it has done here on the issue of damages class certifica-\ntion, it is clear that the Court has not determined or fully considered the remanded issue.\nRather, its intent is for the district court to do so de novo in light of the Circuit’s interven-\ning guidance.  This common sense understanding of the purpose of a remand is further\nsupported here by the very language of the Circuit’s remand instructions upon which\n- 1 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 6 of 22\nplaintiffs rely.  While the Court counseled this court to “bear in mind that ‘[t]here are a\nnumber of management tools available to a district court to address any individualized\ndamages issues,’ ” it specifically identified “decertification after a finding of liability” as\none of these tools.  461 F.3d at 231 (quoting In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust\nLitigation, 280 F.3d 124, 141 (2nd Cir. 2001), cert. denied, Visa U.S.A., Inc. v. Wal-Mart\nStores, 536 U.S. 917 (2002)).\nPlaintiffs are also incorrect to argue that the “principles underlying” the Circuit’s\nliability class decision also support certification of a damages class.  Pls’ Mem. Law at 4.\nIn fact, the Circuit’s legal analysis points to precisely the opposite conclusion.  In holding\nthat this court should have granted partial certification under Rule 23 (c) (4) (A) as to the\nissue of liability even if the action as a whole did not satisfy the Rule 23 (b) (3) predomi-\nnance test, the Court set forth the proper analysis to be followed when partial certification\nof a Rule  23 (b) (3) class as to particular issues in a case – such as liability or damages – is\nsought under Rule 23 (c) (4) (A).  After examining the language of Rule 23 (c) (4) (A)1, the\nCourt stated:\nAs the rule’s plain language and structure establish, a court\nmust  first  identify  the  issues  potentially  appropriate  for\ncertification “and . . . then” apply the other provisions of\nthe rule, i.e., subsection (b) (3) and its predominance anal-\nysis.\n1 “When appropriate (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with\nrespect to particular issues,  . . .  and the provisions of this rule shall then be construed and\napplied accordingly.”  461 F.3d at 226 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (c) (4) (A)) (emphases\nadded by the Court).\n- 2 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 7 of 22\n461 F.3d at 226 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (c) (4) (A)).\nApplying this methodology when “the issues potentially appropriate for certifica-\ntion” are those of liability, common questions predominate, and partial certification under\nRule 23 (c) (4) (A) is therefore proper, as the Court found.  See 461 F.3d at 229-30.  Just as\nsurely, however, when, as in the present posture of this case on remand, “the issues\npotentially appropriate for certification” are those of damages – which this and other\ncourts have repeatedly found to be “inherently individualized” in a strip search case (see\nPoint B, infra) – common questions do not predominate, and partial certification is not\nappropriate.\nThis application of the Court’s legal analysis to the present damages class issue is\nstrikingly supported by the passage in its opinion immediately following its discussion of\nthe language of Rule 23 (c) (4) (A), in which it discusses the Advisory Committee Notes to\nthe rule and cites approvingly the Advisors’ contemplation of cases in which only liability\nwill be tried on a class basis while damages will be tried in individual suits:\n[T]he Advisory Committee Notes confirm this understand-\ning [of the language of the rule].  With respect to subsec-\ntion (c)(4), the notes set forth that, “[f]or example, in a\nfraud or similar case the action may retain its ‘class’ charac-\nter only through the adjudication of liability to the class; the\nmembers of the class may thereafter be required to come in\nindividually  and  prove  the  amounts  of  their  respective\nclaims.”\nAs the notes point out, a court may employ Rule 23 (c) (4)\nwhen  . . .  common questions predominate only as to the\n“particular issues” of which the provision speaks.  Further,\nthe notes illustrate that a court may properly employ this\n- 3 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 8 of 22\ntechnique to separate the issue of liability from damages.\n461 F.3d at 226 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 Advisory Committee Note to 1966 amendment\non subdivision (c) (4)) (italicized emphasis added by the Court; other emphases added\nhere).\nFinally, plaintiffs’ argument that the Second Circuit decision “strongly suggests\ndetermining damages on a class-wide basis,” Pls’ Mem. of Law at 3, is further belied by\nthe apparent practical rationale for the decision.  In holding that a liability class should be\ncertified notwithstanding defendants’ concession of liability, the Court noted that “[a]bsent\nclass certification and its attendant class-wide notice procedures,” most of those subject to\nthe strip search policy would never know of the concession, and thus, “[a]s a practical\nmatter” would never have the opportunity to assert their rights.  461 F.3d at 229.  But this\nnotification will be achieved by virtue of the liability class certification.  After receiving\nthis notice, those liability class members who wish to “may thereafter be required to come\nin individually and prove the amounts of their respective claims” in individual lawsuits, as\nthe Advisory Committee contemplated in the note approvingly quoted by the Court.  See p.\n3 supra.  As discussed in detail in Point B below, most of the courts that have considered\nthe issue have found that this strikes the proper legal and policy balance in strip search\ncases, in which the damages are highly individualized, subjective and variable.  It adheres\nto the predominance rule, while still allowing those liability class members most person-\nally aggrieved by the strip search policy to claim damages, but without diverting scarce\npublic resources to provide a windfall to those who suffered no emotional injury.\n- 4 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 9 of 22\nB. The Proposed Damages Class Does Not Satisfy the \nPredominance Test for Certification Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b) (3).\nA party seeking to certify a Rule 23 (b) (3) class – either as to the action as a whole\nor as to particular issues pursuant to Rule 23 (c) (4) (A) – must establish inter alia “that the\nquestions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any\nquestions affecting only individual members.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b) (3).\nIn its previous decisions repeatedly denying class certification in this case even\nprior to defendants’ concession of liability, this court stressed that the proposed class did\nnot satisfy this predominance test because the highly variable and inherently individualized\ndamages  suffered  by  the  putative  class  plaintiffs  would  necessarily  overshadow  the\ncommon liability issues:\n[P]laintiffs’ claims for damages are particularly unsuited for\na  class  action  since  each  individual  determination  turns\nupon numerous factual considerations.  . . .  \n. . .  Since the extent of any psychological trauma or dis-\ntress felt by inmates who were searched must be calculated\ninto their damage awards, it will be necessary to inquire\ninto the mental and physical health of each plaintiff before\nand  after  the  searches  were  allegedly  conducted.    Such\nintimate, individual, and fact specific determinations do not\nlend themselves to consideration in the context of a class\naction suit.\nMem. Op. and Order dated Mar. 8, 20012 at 23-24 (quoting Klein v. DuPage County, 119\nF.R.D. 29, 31, 32 (N.D. Ill. 1988)).\n2 available as Augustin v. Jablonsky, 2001 U.S. Dist.

[T]he court anticipates individualized and\nhighly specific mini-trials regarding damages [for] mental\ndistress claims [which] will necessarily involve individual-\nized inquiries into, inter alia, the age, gender, employment\nhistory and personal history of the putative class members.\nThese individualized plaintiff-by-plaintiff inquiries clearly\npredominate over any common issues.\nMem. & Order dated Sept. 23, 2003 at 7-8.  See also Mem. & Order dated Nov. 7, 2003 at\n5-6 (after removal of liability issue from the case, “[w]hat remains . . . for adjudication are\nindividual . . . damage issues.  Under such circumstances, class questions do not ‘predomi-\nnate over questions affecting only individual members’ ”); accord Mem. Op. and Order on\nRecons. dated May 23, 2001 at 15.\nWhile the Second Circuit’s decision establishes that this did not justify denial of\nliability  class  certification  (and  consequent  lack  of  notice  to  the  class  members),  the\nreasoning still applies with full force to the present renewed motion to certify a class as to\ndamages issues as well.  Indeed, the Circuit Court’s holding that the predominance test\nanalysis must be applied only to the particular issues for which partial certification under\nRule 23 (c) (4) (A) is sought (see pp. 2 - 4 supra; 461 F.3d at 226-27) makes it even clearer\nthan before that it is inappropriate to certify a damages issues class.3\n3 Plaintiffs may object that extending class certification to damages would not be partial\ncertification under Rule 23 (c) (4) (A), as was the Circuit’s grant of liability class certification,\nas  it  would  result  in  the  entire  action  being  a  class  action,  and  that  therefore  Rule\n(continued...)\n- 6 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 11 of 22\nThe court’s denial of damages class certification in the present case reflects the\ncourse that other federal courts have repeatedly said should be taken in a strip search\naction or other case involving highly individualized and subjective damages.  Perhaps the\nclearest  and  most  relevant  statements  of  this  are  found  in  Judge  McMahon’s  recent\ndecisions  in  a  triad  of  cases  involving  strip  search  policies  in  Dutchess  and  Orange\nCounties: Franklin v. County of Dutchess, 225 F.R.D. 487 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), Dodge v.\nCounty of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), and Maneely v. City of Newburgh,\n208 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).  In each of these cases, as in the present case, plaintiffs\nchallenged a blanket policy of strip searching pre-trial detainees upon admission to jail,\nwithout  regard  to  individualized  reasonable  suspicion  that  they  were  secreting  drugs,\nweapons or contraband, and sought to certify a Rule 23 (b) (3) class of persons who had\nbeen subject to the policy.\nIn Franklin, as here, the county conceded the existence of such a blanket search\npolicy, 225 F.R.D. at 490, 491, and like the present court Judge McMahon therefore\ndenied either (b) (3) certification of the whole action or partial certification of the liability\nissue under Rule 23 (c) (4) (A), concluding that “[n]ot only is there no common question\nthat predominates, there is no common question to try.”  225 F.R.D. at 492.  While her\nholding on partial certification of a liability class has of course been superseded by the\n3 (...continued)\n23 (c) (4) (A) is not applicable.  But then plaintiffs would have to establish that the action as\na whole satisfies the predominance test, and the Circuit did not disturb this court’s holding\nthat it does not.\n- 7 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 12 of 22\nCircuit’s ruling in this case, her reasons for declining to certify a class as to damages\nremain compelling:\nThe disputed issues left to try are the inherently individual-\nized issues of what exactly happened to a particular plain-\ntiff,  how  it  affected  him,  physically  and  mentally,  and\nwhether there are mitigating circumstances that bear on his\nentitlement to recover damages (such as the possibility that\na strip search could have been conducted legally if only the\nDCJ  personnel  had  bothered  to  make  an  individualized\nevaluation of the particular plaintiff’s circumstances).\nId. at 491-92.\nThe relevance of Dodge, decided the same day as Franklin, may be even clearer in\nlight of the Circuit ruling here.  For there the defendant county refused to concede the\nexistence of a blanket strip search policy, and Judge McMahon therefore granted partial\n(b) (3) certification pursuant to Rule 23 (c) (4) (A), as the Circuit has now instructed should\nhave  been  done  here.    However,  Judge  McMahon  stressed  that  the  certification  was\n“limited to the issue of liability only,” 226 F.R.D. at 181 (emphasis added) (see also id. at\n184, 185), and that “the issue of damages, if it cannot be settled, will be litigated  . . .  on\na case-by-case basis.”  Id. at 186.\nIn discussing the unsuitability of the damage claims for class treatment in a strip\nsearch case, Judge McMahon emphasized, as did this court in the present case, their\ninherently individualized nature:\nWhen we turn to damages, however, it is clear that individ-\nual issues predominate.  Even if the plaintiff class members\nwere strip searched illegally pursuant to a uniform policy,\nnot all arriving inmates will have suffered in the same way\n- 8 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 13 of 22\nor to the same extent.  Some may have suffered physical\ndamages as a result of a strip search.  Some may have been\nseverely psychologically damaged.  Some, perhaps many,\nwill not have found the experience terribly degrading.  And\nthere will undoubtedly be certain [plaintiffs] – who knows\nhow  many?  –  whose  damages  may  be  limited  precisely\nbecause they could have been legally strip searched if [Jail]\npersonnel had simply assessed each new arrival for factors\nthat would render a strip search permissible under Second\nCircuit jurisprudence.\nId. at 182-83.\nSimilarly  in  Maneely,  another  case  in  which  the  defendants  denied  that  they\nmaintained a blanket policy of strip searching all arrestees without regard to individ-\nualized suspicion, and thus disputed that they were constitutionally liable, see 208 F.R.D.\nat 78-79, Judge McMahon partially certified a class only as to the liability issue of whether\na blanket policy existed.  Id. at 78.  As to damages, however, she stated that “[i]f the class\nprevails on these [liability] issues, then individual plaintiffs can come forward to litigate,\nin individual suits, the issue of whether  . . .  they suffered damages.”  Id. at 79 (emphasis\nadded).\nOther federal courts have made this same distinction between class certification of\nthe liability phase and the damages phase in a strip search action or other case involving\nhighly subjective and personalized injuries.  Thus, in Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1\n(1st Cir. 2004), as in Maneely and Dodge, the court affirmed class certification in a strip\nsearch case only for resolution of such disputed common liability issues as whether a\nblanket policy existed.  Id. at 4-5, 6-7.  Beyond that, the court suggested that, as these\n- 9 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 14 of 22\nissues were resolved and liability established, “the more the class action might look like a\nbundle of individualized damage claims wholly unsuited for class resolution,” with “each\nclass member  . . .  testify[ing] separately as to the circumstances, emotional damage, lost\nwages, medical treatment, doctor bills, and so on.”  Id. at 6.  “At that point,” the court\nheld, unless a settlement on damages could be reached, it would be proper for the district\ncourt to “enter a judgment of liability, leaving class members to pursue damage claims in\nseparate law suits.”  Id. at 7 (citing, inter alia, Maneely) (emphasis added).  See also Mary\nBeth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1267 n.2 (7th Cir. 1983) (class action challeng-\ning City’s strip search policy decertified for purpose of damages determination).\nThe court made a similar distinction between liability and damages certification in\nAllen v. Int’l Truck & Engine Corp., 358 F.3d 469 (7th Cir.  2004), in which plaintiffs\nsought to certify a class of minority employees in a Title VII action alleging pervasive\nracial harassment at their workplace.  The Court of Appeals directed only the certification\nof a Rule 23 (b) (2) class for the purpose of seeking equitable relief, while noting the\nlikelihood that the district court would find that “other issues, such as assessment of\ndamages for each worker, must be handled individually.”  358 F.3d at 472.  In making this\ndistinction between equitable relief and damages, the court noted the inherently “subjec-\ntive reactions” to racial hostility, which may have “rolled off the backs of some workers,”\nid., while others “suffered great distress,” id. at 471.\nNotably, the Second Circuit made the same distinction in Robinson v. Metro North\nCommuter Railroad Co., 267 F.3d 147, 167-69 (2nd Cir. 2001), directing partial (b) (2)\n- 10 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 15 of 22\ncertification of the liability stage of a Title VII pattern-or-practice discrimination claim,\nbut noting the likelihood that “the remedial stage [would] ultimately [be] resolved on a\nnon-class basis.”  Id. at 168.  \nThe Fifth Circuit similarly declined to certify a (b) (3) class to seek Title VII\ndamages in Allison v. Citgo Petroleum, 151 F.3d 402 (5th Cir. 1998), holding that:\nThe plaintiffs’ claims for  . . .  damages must  . . .  focus\nalmost entirely on facts and issues specific to individuals\nrather than the class as a whole:  . . .  how did [discrimina-\ntion]  affect  each  plaintiff  emotionally  and  physically,  at\nwork and at home; what medical treatment did each plain-\ntiff  receive  and  at  what  expense;  and  so  on  and  so  on.\nUnder such circumstances, an action conducted nominally\nas a class action would degenerate in practice into multiple\nlawsuits separately tried.\nId. at 419 (citation omitted).4\nEven in Carnegie v. Household Int’l, 376 F.3d 656 (7th Cir. 2004), cert. denied sub\nnom., H&R Block, Inc. v. Carnegie, 543 U.S. 1051 (2005), a financial overcharge case in\nwhich damages were objectively calculable and varied by only about $15 between putative\nclass members (see id. at 661), the court affirmed class treatment of only the liability\nphase of the action, stating:\nOften  . . .  there is a big difference from the standpoint of\nmanageability between the liability and remedy phases of a\nclass action.  The number of class members need have no\nbearing on the burdensomeness of litigating a violation  . . .\n4 In Robinson, supra, the Second Circuit declined to follow Allison’s standard for\ncertification under Rule 23 (b) (2) of an action seeking both equitable relief and damages.\nHowever, Robinson did not involve Rule 23 (b) (3) and thus did not discuss this aspect of\nAllison.\n- 11 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 16 of 22\nWhether particular members of the class were defrauded\nand if so what their damages were are another matter, and it\nmay be that if and when the defendants are determined to\nhave violated the law separate proceedings of some charac-\nter will be required to determine the entitlements of the\nindividual class members to relief.\nId. (emphasis added).\nSee also Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000), a strip search case\nupon which plaintiffs rely in their Memorandum, in which the court noted that it would\nconsider decertifying the class for the damages phase of the litigation.  Id. at 25 & n.17.\nAccord Pyke v. Cuomo, 209 F.R.D. 33, 45-47 (N.D.N.Y. 2002) (“certify[ing] a plaintiff\nclass  for  liability  purposes  only,”  and  noting  that  “ultimately  individualized  proof  of\ndamages may be necessary,” and that “the court may consider a decertification of the class\nfollowing liability determinations”).\nFinally,  it  bears  repeating,  as  discussed  in  Point  A  above,  that  the  Advisory\nCommittee notes to Rule 23 expressly contemplate cases in which certification will only\nlast for “the adjudication of liability to the class,” while in order to obtain damages the\nerstwhile class members will “be required to come in individually and prove the amounts\nof their respective claims” in individual suits.  See p. 3 supra; Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 Advisory\nCommittee Note to 1966 amendment on subdivision (c) (4).\n- 12 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 17 of 22\nC. Plaintiffs’ Argument That Denial of Damages Class Certification \nWould Be at Odds with the Purposes of the Rule Is Flawed.\nIn the face of this case law, plaintiffs’ main argument continues to be that the\ndenial of class certification, even at the damages stage, would be at odds with the spirit of\nRule 23 and the civil rights laws, given the economically “marginalized” status of many of\nthe class members.  See Pls’ Mem. of Law at 5-7.  Thus  they continue to reject as naive\nthis court’s view (see Nov. 7, 2003 Mem. & Order at 7) that the availability of attorneys’\nfees and “the absence of any need for an attorney to establish liability” would provide\nsufficient  incentive  for  the  filing  of  individual  damages  lawsuits  on  behalf  of  those\nliability class members aggrieved by the strip search policy.  It is noteworthy, though, that\nJudge McMahon reached the exact same conclusion in Maneely as did the court here:\nWhile potential plaintiffs in these individual suits may well\nbe economically and socially marginalized persons, resolv-\ning their common [liability] claims on a class-wide basis\nwill provide incentive for them to bring suit.  If class coun-\nsel obtains a judgment that Newburgh had a blanket strip\nsearch  policy,  it  will  be  res  judicata  in  each  individual\nlawsuit.  Because plaintiffs who prevail in these cases –\neven those who recover nominal damages – may recoup\nattorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, any misdemeanor or\nviolation arrestee  . . .  should be able to obtain counsel.\n208 F.R.D. at 79 (citing Mid-Hudson Legal Services, Inc. v. Grand Union, Inc., 578 F.2d\n34, 37 (2d Cir. 1978)).\nIn this connection, it should be noted that while plaintiffs argue that most liability\nclass members would not pursue individual damages litigation because the “individual\ndamages are relatively low,” three pages later they envision an average damages award of\n- 13 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 18 of 22\n$10,000 per claimant for at least one sub-class if a damages class is certified.  Compare\nPls’ Mem. of Law at 6-7 with id. at 10.\nFinally, as to plaintiffs’ argument regarding the underlying purposes of Rule 23 and\nthe civil rights laws, however compelling these factors are, they simply cannot overcome\nthe  legal  requirements  of  the  Rule  itself,  such  as  the  predominance  test.    A  similar\nargument was rejected in Lowery v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 158 F.3d 742, 759 (4th Cir.\n1998), a case cited by plaintiffs: “If we were to hold these factors to be the predominant\nconsiderations for certifying a civil rights class, then nearly every suit alleging a pattern or\npractice of discrimination would be certified for class action because these factors would\nexist in nearly every case.”\nD. The “Methods for Class-Wide Damages \nAdjudication” Suggested by Plaintiffs Are Unconvincing.\nPlaintiffs cite only four cases in support of their contention that “[t]here are innum-\nerable ways to adjudicate damages on a class-wide basis after certification.”  Pls’ Mem.\nLaw at 8.  Two of these cases, Mack v. Suffolk County, supra, and Marriot v. Montgomery\nCounty, 03-cv-531 (N.D.N.Y. 2006), are totally irrelevant to analyzing the difficulty of\nclass-wide damages adjudication because they involved settlement plans in which each\nclaimant received a stipulated amount without having to establish any damages.  As this\ncourt stated in previously rejecting similar models advanced by plaintiffs:\nAt most, Plaintiffs have shown that the parties can consent\nto  assign  arbitrary  value  to  such  [subjective  emotional]\nfactors  to  efficiently  administer  a  settlement  agreement.\n- 14 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 19 of 22\nThe Court assumes, on a motion to certify a class that is not\na “settlement class” that this action will go to trial on the\nmerits, in which case Defendants will be entitled to put\nPlaintiffs to their proof of compensatory damages.\nMem. Op. and Order on Recons. dated May 23, 2001 at 16 n. 6 (emphasis in original;\ncitations omitted).\nIn one of the two other cases cited by plaintiffs, Lowery v. Circuit City Stores, Inc.,\nsupra, 158 F.3d at 754 & n. 2, both the district court and the Circuit actually rejected the\nmethod of damages adjudication offered by the plaintiffs here as a model.  In fact, the\ndistrict court decertified the class before the damages phase of trial after it “found the\nmethod of trying class members’ claims to a series of two-week juries to be cumbersome\nand inefficient.”  Id. at 754.  The Court of Appeals upheld this decertification, stating:\n[T]he district court had legitimate concerns that trying the\nsuit as a class action would be unwieldy and unfair to Cir-\ncuit City.  First, the district court rightly questioned whether\nthe Plaintiffs’ proposed trial procedure would be an effi-\ncient  or  accelerated  method  of  disposing  of  the  claims.\nWhile holding two-week trials with separate juries on the\nclass members’ claims would have doubtlessly been more\nefficient and accelerated than bringing dozens of individual\nsuits, that fact does not require the district court to certify a\nclass  action  that  would  nevertheless  be  inefficient  and\ncumbersome.\nId. at 758.\nFinally, plaintiffs rely upon Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 782-87 (9th\nCir. 1996), an extraordinary suit brought in the United States courts on behalf of Filipino\ncitizens who had suffered torture, summary execution or “disappearance” at the hands of\n- 15 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 20 of 22\nthe Marcos dictatorship.  The Ninth Circuit majority, over a vigorous dissent, affirmed the\nmethod of awarding damages to thousands of claimants based upon a small statistical\nsampling of claims, rather than requiring individualized proof.  The majority acknowl-\nedged that the “unorthodox” methodology raised “serious” due process concerns, and\ncould be cause for “profound disquiet,” but found that it was nonetheless “justified by the\nextraordinarily unusual nature of this case.”  Id. at 785, 786.  No such extraordinary\nmeasures or compromises with due process are required here.  Unlike Hilao, this is not a\ncase in which torture victims and the survivors of the executed and the “disappeared” on\nthe other side of the world seek compensation from the estate of a deposed tyrant.  This is\na case in which residents of this County and its environs sustained what plaintiffs acknow-\nledge were “mostly garden-variety emotional distress injuries,” Pls’ Mem. of Law at 10,\nfor which they seek compensation in competition with others in need of public funds.\nMoreover, in asserting that the horrific injuries in Hilao “would be expected to vary more\nwidely”  than  the  “garden-variety”  injuries  here,  id.,  plaintiffs  confuse  severity  with\nvariance.  In fact, one of the factors relied upon by the Hilao court in affirming the\nsampling methodology there was the “similarity in the injuries suffered by many of the\nclass members.”  103 F.3d at 786.  By contrast, as this court and others have stressed, the\nmajor reason for denying damages class certification in a strip search case is that the far\nmore modest emotional injuries suffered by some but by no means all of those subjected to\nan illegal strip search vary widely.\n- 16 -\n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 57      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 21 of 22\nCONCLUSION\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  renewed  motion  for  damages  class  certification\nshould again be denied.\nDated:Mineola, New York\nFebruary 13, 2007\nRespectfully submitted,\nLORNA B.

Hurley \nUnited States District Judge \nEastern District of New York \n100 Federal Plaza \nCentral Islip, NY 11722 \nRe:  Augustin v, Jablonsky, et al., 99-CV-3126 (DRH) / \nNassau County Strip Search Cases 99-CV-2844 (DRH) \nDear Judge Hurley: \nPer Your Honor's request at the last conference, we are writing to address the issue of \nproviding notice to all class members while balancing their privacy interests and the \nconfidentiality of sealed criminal records. \nAs an initial matter, it has long been established that state law privileges do not apply in \nfederal civil rights actions.  See King v. Conde, 121 F.R.D. 180 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). Rather, the \nCourt must balance the interests favoring and opposing disclosure. In this case, the interests in \nunsealing the records far outweigh any confidentiality concerns.  Absent disclosure, notice would \nbe impossible and potentially thousands of individuals to whom the County has conceded \nliability would be denied the notice necessary to vindicate their constitutional rights. This would \nwholly thwart the class action mechanism and the Second Circuit's mandate in this case.  While \nwe have not found other published decisions in the strip search realm, given the number of strip \nsearch class actions, including in New York State, in which notice of certification and/or \nsettlement has been served, it is clear that other courts have made a similar calculus.  Any \nconfidentiality concerns can be addressed by thoughtful design of actual notice to class members. \nSome possibilities include sending notice in a plain envelope with the federal court's address as a \nreturn address and having the notice come on the Court's letterhead. \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 53      Filed 12/20/2006     Page 2 of 2\nBELDOCK  LEVINE  &  HOFFMAN LLP \nEven if arguendo the state law privilege did apply in this federal civil rights action, the \nclear language of CPL § 160.50 pennits the unsealing and production of sealed criminal records \nto a \"designated agent\" of the defendant.  In this case, given that the class has been certified and \nwe represent all members of the liability class, we believe we are designated agents for purposes \nof compliance with the statute. \nIf the Court has any lingering concerns, it could issue an unsealing order for any sealed \nrecords in the interest of permitting aggrieved individuals to have notice sufficient to vindicate \ntheir federal civil rights.  Similar unsealing orders have been issued in other federal civil rights \nclass actions.  For instance, in MacNamara v. City of New York, 2006 WL 3298911 (S.D.N.Y. \nNov. 13, 2006), Magistrate Judge Francis issued an unsealing order for the arrest records of all \nindividuals arrested at various Republican National Convention demonstrations. \nThe need for unsealing criminal records in the instant case is even more compelling than \nin MacNamara.  In that case, class certification has not yet been granted, and the principal \npurpose ofthe request for the unsealing order was to help the individual plaintiffs establish a \nMonell claim and establish grounds for class certification.  Here, those whose records would be \nunsealed are already members of a certified class, and it is their constitutional interests which \nwould be directly thwarted absence unsealing and notification. \nFor these reasons, we believe that providing the information necessary to serve notice on \nall class members would be appropriate and necessary to vindicate these civil rights claims. \ncc: All counsel \n2 ",

For the following reasons, the \nCourt grants Defendants' motion and denies Plaintiffs' motion. \nI.  DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO \"CLARIFY\" THE PREVIOUS CONCESSION \nOF LIABILITY. \nTo render the circumstances of the instant cross-motions clear, the Court must \nprovide some procedural background to this case. All of the following facts are derived \nfrom the undisputed procedural background of the instant case. \nOn May 20, 1999, the first of these three consolidated putative class action cases, \nFrancis O'Day. et al. v. Nassau County. et al. (99-CV-2844), was initiated by filing a \ncomplaint. This complaint sought equitable relief and damages due to a strip search \npolicy utilized by the Nassau County Correctional Center (\"NCCC\"). As alleged in this \ncomplaint, NCCC's strip search policy was applied to all individuals charged with \nmisdemeanors and minor offenses, regardless of any specific factual circumstances. On \nJune 1, 1999, Judge Wexler, in Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), \naff'd. in relevant part, 273 F.3d 56 (2001), held that \"[t]he policy of strip searching all \nmisdemeanor and minor offense arrestees remanded to the NCCC, without requiring any \nsuspicion that the remanded individual is concealing weapons or other contraband, \n-2-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 3 of 15\nviolates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" 53 F. Supp. 2d at 568. \nThe other two complaints relevant to the instant action were filed after Judge Wexler's \nruling. The Court now considers all of the complaints. \nThe amended complaint in Francis O'Day (99-CV-2844), was filed on August 24, \n1999. In that complaint, the named plaintiffs sought monetary and injunctive relief due to \n(1) Defendants' policy of strip searching all non-felony admits to the NCCC and also (2) \ndue to Defendants alleged policy of strip searching all persons who have posted bail, or \nwho have otherwise been deemed releasable by a court, and who are then strip searched \nagain upon their return from court. See O'Day Amended Complaint~ 2. The amended \ncomplaint also alleges a \"policy practice and custom\" of unconstitutionally delaying in \nreleasing individuals who have already posted bail or are otherwise deemed \"releasable.\" \nId. ~ 3. \nThe amended complaint in Gardy Augustin. et al.. v. Joseph Jablonsky. et al. (99-\nCV-3126), the second initiated of the consolidated actions, seeks money damages and \ninjunctive relief for Defendants' purported policy of searching non-felony-charged \nindividuals when they are admitted to NCCC. See Augustin Amended Complaint~~ 3, 8-\n21. This amended complaint does not allege causes of action for either searches at other \npoints during detention or for any delays in being released. \nFinally, the amended complaint filed in Iaffaldano v. The County ofNassau. et al. \n(99-CV-4238), seeks money damages and injunctive relief from Defendants' purported \n-3-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 4 of 15\npolicy of searching non-felony-charged individuals when they are admitted to NCCC. See \nIaffaldano Amended Complaint~~ 4-6. This amended complaint targets the routine strip \nsearches that were conducted upon and during admittance to the NCCC. See id. ~ 34. No \nclaims are made for delays in being released. \nAfter the Shain decision, the Court received a motion to consolidate all of the \nabove captioned cases and to certify a class. The class definition suggested by Plaintiffs at \nthat time embraced \"all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who \nhave been admitted to the [NCCC] and strip searched without particularized reasonable \nsuspicion.\" On March 8, 2001 the Court granted the motion for consolidation and denied \nPlaintiffs' motion for class certification. See Augustin v. Jablonsky, No. 99-CV-3126, \n2001 WL 770839 (E.D.N.Y. March 8, 2001) (\"March 8 Order\"). In that order the Court \nheld, inter alia, that the proffered class definition would cause individual issues to \nsubstantially predominate over all common issues, thereby rendering class certification \ninappropriate. The Court denied reconsideration in a May 23, 2001 Memorandum \nOpinion and Order (\"May 23 Order\"). Plaintiffs' subsequent interlocutory appeal was \ndenied by the Second Circuit. \nOn September 23, 2003, the Court addressed Plaintiffs renewed motion for class \ncertification (\"September 23 Order\"). In connection with that renewed motion, Plaintiffs \nrevised the definition of their putative class. This proposed class definition included \nall persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in Nassau \nCounty who thereafter were strip[- ]searched at the [NCCC] pursuant to \n-4-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 5 of 15\ndefendants' blanket policy, practice and custom which required that all \narrestees be strip-searched upon admission to the facility .... [This \ndefinition shall not] include individuals who were strip[-]searched after \nJudge Wexler's June 1, 1999[,] decision in Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d \n564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), affd., 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 123 \nS.Ct. 672 (December 9, 2002) .... \nPlaintiffs' Mem. at 2. \nHowever, because Defendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' motion contained certain \nnotable language, the Court did not reach that class definition. The relevant language \nstated: \n[D]efendants concede the existence of the one common issue that might be \nappropriate for class certification ... -namely, whether the [NCCC]'s strip \nsearch policy during the class period was constitutional. However, in Shain, \n... the Second Circuit held that the NCCC's policy of strip searching \npersons charged with a misdemeanor and remanded to the facility in the \nabsence of reasonable suspicion that they were carrying weapons or \ncontraband was unconstitutional. Defendants are bound by Shain under the \ndoctrine of collateral estoppel .... Given that the constitutionality of \nNCCC's strip search policy has now been resolved, there is no need to \ncertify a class with respect to that issue. \nDefendants' Opp. Mem. at 8 (citations and footnotes removed) \nThe Court read this language \"as a concession ofliability as to the named Plaintiffs \n(and, presumably, as to all others similarly situated) except to the extent that some \ncorrections officers may have searched some plaintiffs based upon a reasonable and \ncontemporaneously held suspicion rather than pursuant to the blanket strip search policy \nthen in effect.\" September 23 Order at 5-6 (footnote omitted). However, the Court gave \nDefendants the opportunity to retract or modify this concession. See id. at 6 n. 2. Despite \nthis clear and unambiguous opportunity, Defendants did not withdraw or otherwise \n-5-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 6 of 15\nmodify the concession. In fact, they later reaffirmed their concession. On the basis of this \nconcession, the Court found that there were no remaining common disputed issues of fact \nor law and held that class certification would be inappropriate. The Court later reaffirmed \nthis holding despite Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. See October 27, 2003, Order. \nThe circumstances have since changed. Defendants have since referred the instant \ncase away from their previous counsel; presumably preferring representation by the in \nhouse Nassau County Attorney's Office. This new counsel now seeks to \"clarify the \nprevious concession ofliability.\" At first blush, it appeared to the Court that Defendants \nsought to retroactively alter the basis for the Court's substantive orders in this case. For \nthis reason, in a conference connected with this request to clarify, the Court indicated that \nDefendants may need to explain why the principle of judicial estoppel would not apply. \nSee United States v. Hussein, 178 F.3d 125, 130 (2d Cir. 1999). Subsequently, the Court \nissued an order directing Defendants to make a formal motion to clarify the prior \nconcession. One of the issues that the Court directed Defendants to address in their \nmotion was the aforementioned doctrine of judicial estoppel. Upon review of Defendants' \nclarified concession, which the Court does not consider inconsistent with the prior \nconcession, and the absence of any prejudice to Plaintiffs, the Court concludes that the \nmotion should be granted. \nThe Court has carefully read Defendants' motion. As set out therein, Defendants' new \nconcession only applies to the blanket strip searches of all non-felony \"new admits\" to the \n-6-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 7 of 15\nNCCC. Defendant do not concede liability as to any other alleged strip search policy. As an \ninitial matter, the Court fails to see how this concession is different than the one that was \nmade in connection with the September 23 Order. The instant concession applies solely to \nthe blanket search policy as it was applied non-felony new admits to NCCC while the \nconcession made in connection with the September 23 Order conceded liability in connection \nwith Shain. Since, as discussed supra, Shain concerned the constitutionality of the policy \nrequiring strip searches of all non-felony admitees to NCCC, the Court cannot divine any \nsubstantive difference between the two concessions.1 Since such a difference is a necessary \nelement for the invocation ofj udicial estoppel, the Court concludes that this doctrine should \nnot prevent Defendants from the asserting the concession articulated in the context of the \ninstant motion. \nFurthermore, the Court notes that it cannot ascertain any prejudice to Plaintiffs \nflowing from this clarified concession. Indeed, although Plaintiffs express exasperation with \nthe \"clarification,\" they do not actively oppose Defendants' motion. Therefore, in light of the \nobservation that the two concessions are substantively identical and the lack ofp rejudice, the \nCourt accepts Defendants' clarified concession ofliability. For the purposes of clarity, the \nCourt will set forth this concession as follows: the County's amended concession ofliability \napplies solely to the blanket search policy as it was applied non-felony new admits to NCCC; \n1Due to this absence of any substantive difference, the Court cannot ascertain why \nDefendants felt obligated to clarify their concession, thereby necessitating the instant cross \nmotions. However, whatever the reasons, Defendants have endeavored to clarify their position. \n-7-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 8 of 15\nit does not cover the alleged strip search policy covering all persons who have posted bail or \nhave otherwise been deemed releasable, which is the subject of certain claims by some, \nalthough not all, of the named plaintiffs in this consolidated case, see Amended Complaint, \nFrancis O'Day (99-CV-2844). \nII.  PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS. \nIn response to Defendants' application to change their concession, Plaintiffs now \nrenew their motion for class certification with a new proposed class definition. To certify a \nclass  pursuant  to  Rule  23,  the  putative  class  members  must  first  establish  that  the \nprerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been met and then establish that the action qualifies for \ncertification in accordance with Rule 23(b )(1 ), Rule 23(b )(2) or Rule 23(b )(3). See In re Visa \nCheck/MasterMoneyAntitrustLitigation, 280 F.3d 124,  132-133  (2d Cir.  2001).  This \nrequires a rigorous analysis at each step.  See Selby v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 197 \nF.R.D. 48, 54 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). The Court now considers the proposed class definition in \nlight of these standards. \nA.  Plaintiffs' Proposed Class Definition. \nPlaintiffs allege a new class definition. This proposed class definition includes \"all \npersons who have or will be arrested for non-felony offenses and admitted to the NCCC.\" \nPlaintiffs' Mem. at 5. Plaintiffs indicate thatthis definition embraces all individuals that were \n-8-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 9 of 15\narrested between May 20, 1996, and the future date of an order from the Court directing \nDefendants to cease their policy. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should certify five \noverlapping subclasses. As presented, the Court is unwilling to accept this definition. \nB.  Rule 23(a). \nUnder Rule 23(a), there are four prerequisites to certification of a class: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) \nthere are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or \ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of \nthe class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). As currently framed, Plaintiffs' class definition fails to satisfy three of \nthe four prerequisites for class certification. \nAs an initial matter it is clear that the first prerequisite, sometimes referred to as \n\"numerosity,\" is  satisfied  by Plaintiffs'  proposed  class  definition.  Defendants  do  not \nmeaningfully argue that the individuals embraced by the instant proposed class definition fail \nto satisfy the numerosity requirement. Thus, joinder of the individuals embraced by the \nsuggested class definition would indeed be impracticable. The other three prerequisites to \nclass certification, however, are not satisfied by this definition. \nOn the face of the proposed class definition, no questions oflaw or fact are common \nor typical to all members of the class. These requirements are considered together because \n[t  ]he commonality and typicality requirements tend to merge into one another, \nso that similar considerations animate analysis of Rules 23(a)(2) and (3). The \ncrux of both requirements is to ensure that \"maintenance of a class action is \n-9-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 10 of 15\neconomical and [that] the named plaintiffs claim and the class claims are so \ninterrelated that the interests oft he class members will be fairly and adequately \nprotected in their absence.\" \nMarisol A. by Forbes v.  Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 376 (2d Cir.  1997) (citations omitted) \n(quoting General Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n. 13 (1982)). \nTo satisfy the commonality requirement, Plaintiffs must establish that their claims \nshare a common question oflaw or fact. See In reAgent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d \n145, 166-167 (2d Cir. 1987). The class, as defined, does not share such an issue. This lack \nof commonality springs from the extremely broad character of the proposed class definition. \nThis is best highlighted by comparing Plaintiffs' proposed subdefinitions. See Plaintiffs' \nMem. at 5. By way of illustration the first four subdefinitions involve strip search policies \nat NCCC while the fifth  subdefinition merely embraces those who, under the specific \ncircumstances of each of their individual cases, were delayed in their release from NCCC \nafter being deemed \"releasable.\" As framed, there is no adequate degree of factual or legal \ncommonality among these subdefinitions, all of which are embraced by the larger proposed \nclass definition. Next, the Court notes that the June I, 1999, cessation of the new admits \npolicy that resulted in strip searches for the named Plaintiffs obviates any commonality with \nindividuals who were later searched. Thus, as framed, the only commonality lies in the fact \nthat  all  members  were  arrested  for  non-felony  crimes.  However,  this  common,  and \nundisputed, arrest history does not set forth an adequate common issue of law or fact. \nA class representative's claims are \"typical\" under Rule 23(a)(3), where each class \nmember's claims arise from the same course of events and each class member makes similar \n-10-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 11 of 15\nlegal arguments to prove defendants' liability. See Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. \nCo., 267 F.3d 147,  155  (2d Cir. 2001). \"While it is settled that the mere existence of \nindividualized factual questions with respect to the class representative's claim will not bar \nclass certification, class certification is inappropriate where a putative class representative \nis subject to unique defenses which threaten to become the focus of the litigation.\" Gary \nPlastic Packaging Com. v. Merrill Lynch. Pierce. Fenner & Smith. Inc., 903 F.2d 176, 180 \n(2d Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). The individualized fact questions relevant to the instant \ncase have been thoroughly discussed in previous orders. The Court will not address those \nissues again in the context of the instant motion. Nonetheless, other problems remain with \nthe purported typicality of this class definition. As it stands, the fifth subdefinition details a \nfactual scenario that is not typical ofthe class members. There is no allegation that there was \na policy of delaying people who have been deemed \"releasable.\" Therefore, the instant class \ndefinition embraces a claim that could conceivably only embrace the named Plaintiffs who \nhave asserted this claim. Furthermore, the Court notes that the claim for delay in release is \natypical even among the named Plaintiffs. For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to \nestablish typicality for the purposes of the instant class definition. \nFor all of the reasons discussed supra, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not \nestablished the requirements set for in Rule 23(a). \n-11-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 12 of 15\nC.  Timing. \nAll of the named Plaintiffs were searched pursuant to a strip search policy that ended \non June 1, 1999. The proposed class definition, however, encompasses the period between \nMay 20, 1996, and the future date of an order from the Court directing Defendants to cease \ntheir policy. As such, the proposed class is currently unbounded in both its size and time. The \nnumber of people falling within that proposed class and the circumstances of their cases are \npractically impossible to predict. \nPlaintiffs provide no support for such an unbounded class. The Court is aware that \nclass precision is less important in the Rule 23(b )(2) context. See Anderson v. Coughlin, 119 \nF.R.D.  1,  3  (N.D.N.Y.  1988).  However,  both Rule  23(b)(2)  and  Rule  23(b)(3)  class \ncertification is sought by Plaintiffs. Moreover, the instant class is so imprecisely defined that \nthe Court feels it may be unworkable. Finally the Court notes that it is appropriate for the \nCourt to ensure that the class definition is \"precise, objective, and presently ascertainable.\" \nNicholson v. Williams, 205 F.R.D. 92, 97 (E.D.N.Y. 2001). For these reasons, the Court \nconcludes that further briefing is appropriate regarding the time limits on the proposed class \ndefinition. \nD.  Additional Problems with the Instant Class Definition. \nThe Court notes that Plaintiffs again seek class certification for those acts where \nDefendants have conceded liability. For the reasons discussed in both the Court's September \n-12-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 13 of 15\n23 Order and the October 27 Order, the Court declines to certify a class that would include \nacts for which liability is  conceded. Since Plaintiffs'  current proposed class definition \nembraces such conceded causes of action, even under Defendants' amended concession of \nliability, this definition is framed improperly. \nIn addition, the Court harbors doubts that the named Plaintiffs are representative of \nthe putative class. Plaintiffs now seek to certify a class, in part, as to individuals that were \nsearched pursuant to an alleged post-Shain policy of searching all non-felony admitees to \nNCCC. Due to the vintage of the instant case, none of the named Plaintiffs were searched \npursuant to that alleged policy. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the named Plaintiff can \nadequately represent that portion of the proposed class. \nFinally, the Court notes that instant class definition embraces individuals that were not \nincluded in the prior class definitions. In particular, the Court notes that a class based upon \ndelays in being released are wholly inconsistent with all of Plaintiffs' prior class definitions. \nFurthermore, the Court notes that a class embracing searches other than those made upon \ninitial admittance into NCCC, i.e. searches embraced by the facts of the Shain case, is clearly \ninconsistent with the definition addressed in the September 23 Order. Accordingly, the only \ntruly inconsistent position advanced by the parties in the context of the instant cross-motions \ncomes from Plaintiffs, not from Defendants. \nIt is unclear what consequences flow from the fact that Plaintiffs' current position is \ninconsistent with their position during the previous five years of this litigation. However, \n-13-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 14 of 15\ninconsistently alleged classes have been found to support the denial of motions to certifY \nclasses in other cases. See Cavallo v. Utica-Watertown Health Ins. Co .. Inc., 191 F.R.D. 342, \n346 (N.D.N.Y. 2000); cf. W. Alton Jones Foundation v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 97 F.3d 29, \n35 (2d Cir. 1996); Soranno v. New York Life Ins. Co., No. 96-CV- 7882, 2001 WL 290303, \nat *3 (N.D. Ill. March 20, 2001); Ernest P. Kline & Eugene F. Knopf. v. First Western \nGovernment Securities. Inc .. eta!., No. 83-CV-1076, 1996 WL 153641, at *12 (E.D.Pa. \nJanuary 24, 1996). As such, the Court feels obliged to note some of the inconsistencies in \nPlaintiffs' class definitions. \nE.  Rule 23(b) (2) and Rule 23(b) (3). \nBecause of the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs have not satisfied 23(a), the Court \ndoes not reach the propriety of certifYing the proposed class definition under Rule 23(b) (2) \nor Rule 23(b )(3). \nIII.  CLASS  CERTIFICATION  UPON  THE  DEFINITION  ADVANCED IN \nCONNECTION WITH THE SEPTEMBER 23 ORDER. \nPlaintiffs suggest that, should the instant class definition not warrant certification, the \nCourt should certifY a class pursuant to the definition earlier provided in connection with the \nSeptember 23 Order. The Court disagrees. As discussed supra, the Court does not find any \nsubstantive difference between Defendants two concessions. For this reason, the prior class \n-14-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 15 of 15\ndefinition  would fail  for  the  identical  reasons  articulated in the  September 23  Order. \nAccordingly, the Court declines to certify a class based upon that earlier submitted, and \npreviously rejected, class definition. \nIV.  CONCLUSIONS. \nFor the reasons discussed supra, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to change \ntheir concession ofliability and DENIES Plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. \nSO ORDERED \n/s/ \nJ \nDated:  Central Islip, New York \nAugust 20, 2004  - -UilrtedStirtes Dlstrict Judge \n-15-",

First, Defendants maintain that the proposed \nOpinion  publication in The New York Times, the cost of which, \n  approximately $78,000, “dwarf[s] the total cost of all the \nother  publications  combined”1  is  a  waste  of  resources \ngiven  that  the  demographics  of  its  readership  do  not \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nmatch  Plaintiff’s  asserted  demographics  of  the  class. \nSecond, defendants argue that because the cost of three \ninsertions in the Daily News is approximately $29,000, \nHURLEY, Senior District Judge. \nwhile the cost of three insertions in the New York Post, \nwhich has a much larger circulation, is approximately \n*1 The purpose of this memorandum is to address certain \n$7,500.00, the abbreviated notice should be published in \nissues  that  have  been  raised  with  respect  to  class \nthe Daily News only once, perhaps on a Sunday when the \nnotification and the cost therefor.

Finally, \n19, 2009, March 23, 2009, March 25, 2009, March 30, \ndefendants oppose plaintiffs’ request that the Court “order \n2009 and April 6, 2009. \nthe defendants to pay each publication invoice within five \n  \ndays of its submission to the county’s attorneys.” \n \n  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B) requires, for \nBackground  a class certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), that a court \n“direct to class members the best notice that is practicable \nBy way of background, the Court, by Memorandum and  under the circumstances, including individual notice to all \nOrder dated March 16, 2009, directed that the defendants  members  who  can  be  identified  through  reasonable \npay the costs of class notification subject to the following  effort.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2) (b).
