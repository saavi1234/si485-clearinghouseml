Following their arrests, plaintiffs were transferred to the custody of the U.S. Marshall and then detained in holding cells at the D.C. Superior Courthouse.  Plaintiffs alleged that, while in custody, they were subjected to unlawful strip searches which had been conducted by deputy U.S. Marshals in the absence of any individualized reasonable suspicion.  Plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the George Washington University Law School and the People's Law Resource Center, alleged that such searches violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. Plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages and class certification.</p><p>On April 19, 2006, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the suit.  The District Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, dismissing the claims raised against two former U.S. Marshals who were sued in their official capacity, but refusing to dismiss the claims raised against Marshal Dillard in his individual capacity.  Specifically, the Court held that (1) Plaintiffs' Bivens claims were timely; (2) Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Marshal Dillard was a state actor; (3) Marshal Dillard was not entitled to qualified immunity at the motion to dismiss phase; and (4) Plaintiffs adequately stated a claim under the Fourth Amendment.  Bame v. Clark, 466 F.Supp.2d 105 (D.D.C. Dec 11, 2006).  </p><p>Marshal Dillard initially filed a notice of appeal but subsequently moved to dismiss the appeal.  The appeal was dismissed by the District Court on June 11, 2007.  Bame v. Dillard, 2007 WL 1760490 (D.C.Cir. Jun 11, 2007). </p><p>On May 22, 2008, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer granted class certification.  Bame v. Clark, 2008 WL 2168393 (D.C.Cir. May 22, 2008). </p><p>On August 25, 2009, Judge Collyer denied the defendant's and the plaintiff's motions for summary judgment. Bame v. Dillard, 647 F.Supp.2d 43 (D.C. Cir. 2009). The defendant appealed. </p><p>On March 25, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Judge dismissed the case, holding that it was not clearly established in 2002 that the strip search of a person being introduced into a detention facility violated the Fourth Amendment, and that therefore, the defendant was entitled to qualified immunity and to summary judgment.

Plaintiffs Paul Bame, Ivan Welander, and Greg Keltner bring this action on their own \nbehalf and on behalf of all other men who were arrested on September 27, 2002 during \nseveral large protests involving hundreds of people in downtown Washington, D.C, and \nwho were subjected to an unlawful strip search as described herein. On September 28, \n2002, several hours following their arrest, the men were subjected to unlawful strip \nsearches by defendants deputy U.S. Marshals acting under the supervision of Todd \nDillard, then the U.S. Marshall for the District of Columbia. The strip searches were \nconducted without reasonable, particularized, individualized suspicion in violation of \ntheir Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action and plaintiffs’ 42 U.S.C. §1983 and Bivens \nclaims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3).   \n3.  Venue is appropriate in this District because each of the claims for relief arose in this \n \n2 \n\n \njudicial district. \nPARTIES PLAINTIFF \n4.  Plaintiff Paul Bame was arrested on charges of “incommoding”  and two other minor \ninfractions during a mass protest in Washington, D.C. on September 27, 2002. He was \narrested by officers of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia \n(“D.C. Police”), or officers of police departments acting under the supervision of the D.C.  \nPolice.   \na.  After his arrest he was initially held in custody of the D.C. Police and then was \ntransferred to the custody of deputy U.S. Marshals and held in their custody for \nseveral hours lasting into September 28, 2002. \nb.  While held in custody of the U.S. Marshals, several deputies conducted a strip \nsearch on him in the presence of eight to twelve other male arrestees, who were \nstrip searched at the same time.  The search performed on him was conducted \nwithout the deputies having any individualized, reasonable suspicion upon which \nto base a search. \nc.  He was released a few hours later after appearing before a judge at the federal \ncourthouse.  He was not required to post bond. \nd.  He is an adult resident of the State of Colorado.  \n5.  Plaintiff Greg Keltner was arrested during a mass protest in Washington, D.C. on \nSeptember 27, 2002. He was arrested by D.C. police officers, or officers of police \ndepartments acting under the supervision of the D.C. Police.   \na.  After his arrest he was initially held in custody of the D.C. Police and then was \n \n3 \n\n \ntransferred to the custody of deputy U.S. Marshals and held in their custody for \nseveral hours lasting into September 28, 2002. \nb.  While held in custody of the U.S. Marshals, several deputies conducted a strip \nsearch on him in the presence of eight to twelve other male arrestees, who were \nstrip searched at the same time.  The search performed on him was conducted \nwithout the deputies having any individualized, reasonable suspicion upon which \nto base a search. \nc.  He was released a few hours later without being brought before a judge and \nwithout posting bond.  \nd.  He is an adult resident of the State of Wisconsin. \n6.  Plaintiff Ivan Welander was arrested during a mass protest in Washington, D.C. on \nSeptember 27, 2002. He was arrested by D.C. police officers, or officers of police \ndepartments acting under the supervision of the D.C.  Police.   \na.  After his arrest he was initially held in custody of the D.C. Police and then was \ntransferred to the custody of deputy U.S. Marshals and held in their custody for \nseveral hours lasting into September 28, 2002. \nb.  While held in custody of the U.S. Marshals, several deputies conducted a strip \nsearch on him in the presence of eight to twelve other male arrestees, who were \nstrip searched at the same time.  The search performed on his was conducted \nwithout the deputies having any individualized, reasonable suspicion upon which \nto base a search. \nc.  He was released a few hours later without being brought before a judge and \n \n4 \n\n \nwithout posting bond.  \nd.  He is an adult resident of the State of Wisconsin. \nPARTIES DEFENDANTS \n7.  Defendant John F. Clark, is sued in his official capacity as the Acting Director of the \nUnited States Marshal’s Service (“USMS”), which is an agency of the United States \nGovernment. \n8.  Defendant George B. Walsh is sued in his official capacity as the United States Marshall \nfor the District of Columbia. \n9.   Todd Walther Dillard was the United States Marshall for the District of Columbia at all \ntimes relevant to this action.  He is sued in his individual capacity. \n10.  Defendants John Does 1 through 15 were, or are, deputy United States Marshals at all \ntimes relevant to this action.  They are each sued in their individual capacity. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n11.  Named plaintiffs bring this action under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3) on \nbehalf of the class consisting of:  \na.  each man who was: (1) arrested on September 27, 2002 by the D.C. Police \nofficials during a series of mass protests in downtown Washington, D.C.; (2) \nremanded by D.C. Police, following that arrest, into the custody of the U.S. \nMarshal for the District of Columbia prior to being released; and (3) subjected by \ndeputy U.S. Marshals to a strip, visual, body cavity search without any \nparticularized or individualized reasonable suspicion that he was concealing \ndrugs, weapons or other contraband; (4) excluding, however, all men arrested \n \n5 \n\n \nwithin the confines of Pershing Park on September 27, 2002. \n12.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The exact number \nof the class membership is not known.  However, records of the D.C. Superior Court \ndated September 28, 2002, entitled “IMF Mass Protest Lock Up List” list at least ninety \nmen.  On information and belief, at least half this number were arrested at mass protests \nother than at Pershing Park.  Thus, this class consists of at least 45 men, and possibly \nmore than one hundred men. \n13.  The class is manageable in that all members of the proposed class will be identifiable \nfrom records in the possession of defendants, and from other official records. \n14.  There are questions of fact and law which are common to all class members, and \ncommon to the claims of the named plaintiffs, including: \na.  What were the nature and extent of the strip searches conducted on every member \nof the plaintiffs class? \nb.  Whether the searches conducted by defendants on the plaintiff class members \ncomported with the standards provided under the Fourth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution? \nc.  What policies, customs, or practices resulted in the defendants conducting strip \nsearches on the plaintiff class members? \nd.  Whether the U.S. Marshal’s Service, the United States Marshal in his official \ncapacity, or former Marshal Dillard in his individual capacity, were deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of the class members by failing to train their staff \nconcerning reasonable search procedures, sufficient to give rise to a claim against \n \n6 \n\n \nhim under 42 U.S.C. §1983? \ne.  Whether the law in the District of Columbia was sufficiently clearly established as \nof September, 2002 with regard to the legality of the strip searches conducted by \ndefendants, such that the defendants are not protected by any qualified immunity? \nf.  Whether the class members sustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of \nsuch damages? \ng.  Whether Defendants were acting as an agent of or in joint action with the District \nof Columbia, or otherwise acting under color of D.C. law? \n15.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the \nclass.   \na.  Named plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of all class members in that they \nwere each subjected to unlawful strip searches during the same mass arrest \nepisode of custody as the other class members, each of whom suffered a similar \nstrip search; \nb.  Named plaintiffs have no conflicts with the other class members; \nc.  There are no individual questions on the issue of liability, since every member of \nthe plaintiff class was subjected to a blanket strip search. \n16.  Named plaintiffs have retained counsel who have handled complex federal court class \nactions in various issue areas, including claims for unlawful strip searches of prisoners.   \na.  Lynn E. Cunningham has practiced law in the District of Columbia for thirty \nyears and handled successful class action litigation in the areas of welfare rights, \nhealth benefits, housing rights, as well as prisoner’s rights.   \n \n7 \n\n \nb.  Zachary Wolfe has practiced law for four years in the District of Columbia, \nhandling a variety of cases, including successfully challenging illegal police \nactions with regard to public protests in D.C..  \nGENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n17.  On September 27, 2002, hundreds of persons, including plaintiff class members, staged a \nmass protest of certain federal agency policies in various locations in downtown \nWashington, D.C., including outside the International Monetary Fund headquarters, and \nvarious government agency and corporate headquarters buildings. \n18.  Hundreds of protestors, including plaintiff class members, were arrested by D.C. Police \nofficers, and police officials from other agencies acting under the direction of D.C. \npolice, and under the police powers of the Government of the District of Columbia. \n19.  After being held in the custody of the D.C. Police for many hours, the plaintiff class \nmembers and other arrestees were remanded by D.C. Police officials to the defendants \nduring the night of September 27, 2002 and then held in custody at the United States \nCourthouse for the District of Columbia, awaiting arraignment on the criminal charges \nlodged against them. \n20.  Plaintiffs and plaintiff class members were held in the custody of USMS, and in the \nphysical custody of the individual defendants until the charges alleged against them could \nbe determined, judicially or otherwise.  This determination occurred during the day on \nSeptember 28, 2002.   \n21.  While in the custody of the USMS, each and every plaintiff class member, and other \narrestees, was subjected to strip searches in spite of the marshals having no individualized \n \n8 \n\n \nreasonable suspicion for doing so. \n22.  On information and belief, defendant Dillard and the USMS deputies conducted the \nuniform, blanket strip searches of each and every class member male arrestee on \nSeptember 28, 2002 pursuant to an official USMS custom, policy or practice. \n23.  The strip searches conducted on the plaintiffs and plaintiff class members entailed the \nfollowing actions: \na.  Small teams of defendants took aside small groups of eight to twelve plaintiff \nclass members into a separate holding area; \nb.  Plaintiffs were ordered to drop their trousers and underpants, face a wall, and to \nsquat down and cough in front of the deputy marshals; \nc.  No contraband was found on any class member; \nd.  On information and belief, no records were made by the defendants of the results \nof the strip searches. \n24.  The strip searches were intimidating, humiliating, and subjected each class member to \nstrong emotional distress. \n25.  Within a few hours after the strip searches were conducted, each class member was \nreleased either under bond, after pleading guilty to a minor offense such as failure to obey \na police officer or “incommoding,” or without any charge being advanced against him. \n26.  No class member was tried or convicted of any felony or crime involving violence or \ndrug charges in connection with the arrests on September 27, 2002. \n27.  Both male and female protest arrestees were subjected to the searches.  On information \nand belief, the women’s claims with regard to strip searches are addressed under separate \n \n9 \n\n \nlitigation.   \n28.  On information and belief, claims of persons arrested at Pershing Park protests on that \nday are also addressed under separate litigation. \nCLAIM ONE – BIVENS PERSONAL LIABILITY OF  \nFORMER UNITED STATES MARSHALL TODD WALTHER DILLARD  \nAND OF UNITED STATES MARSHALL SERVICE  \nEMPLOYEES DOES 1-15 FOR  \nVIOLATION OF FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS. \n \n29.  Plaintiffs re-allege and reincorporate paragraphs 1 through 28 herein.  \n30.  Named plaintiffs and every member of the plaintiff class have a right protected under the \nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution not to be subjected to unreasonable \nsearches and seizures by persons acting under United States and District of Columbia \ngovernmental authority. \n31.  The said protection includes the right of an arrestee held on a non-drug, non-violent \noffense in police custody not to be subjected to a strip search in the absence of an \nindividualized, reasonable suspicion on the part of the searching officer that there is a \nbasis for the search. \n32.  Defendants Dillard and John Does numbers 1 through 15 violated that right, while acting \nin their capacity as U.S. Marshal and deputy U.S. Marshals by conducting on each named \nplaintiff and each member of the plaintiff class a search on September 28, 2002, \nconsisting of the one or more of the defendants personally ordering each individual \nplaintiff to remove his clothing and exposing private parts of his body to a full visual \ninspection by one or more of the defendants, in the presence of other class members. \n33.  The defendants conducted the said searches in the absence of any reasonable, \n \n10 \n\n \nindividualized suspicion that any plaintiff was secreting any form of contraband on his \nperson. \n34.  Defendants violated clearly established law in conducting the searches:    \na.  Washington, D.C. had been the site of large scale protests for decades prior to \nSeptember, 2002. \nb.  These protests have resulted many times in arrests of large numbers of protestors.  \nc.  Courts had ruled in previous decades on the proper standards for the police \ntreatment of arrested protestors, and held that certain forms of highly intrusive \nsearches of such arrestees’ persons were violative of Fourth Amendment \nstandards. \nd.  As a result, the law governing what constitutes a reasonable ground for strip \nsearching a prisoner had, as of 2002, long been clearly established in the District \nof Columbia, and, in particular, the illegality of conducting strip searches without \nany individualized, reasonable suspicion upon which to ground the searches. \ne.  The defendants conducted the searches when acting under governmental \nauthority. \nf.  The defendants had fair notice of the applicable legal standard for the conduct of \nstrip searches of prisoners. The plaintiffs were non-violent, non-felon, non-drug-\nrelated prisoners, who had been arrested in the course of a peaceful protest against \ngovernment policies.  \ng.  All the searches were highly invasive strip searches  \n35.   There are no special factors to suggest to that the Court should decline to provide a \n \n11 \n\n \nspecial cause of action or a remedy for the defendants’ violations of plaintiffs’ rights. \n36.  Individual defendants are each individually and directly liable under the Fourth \nAmendment to each member of the plaintiff class for monetary damages for the injuries \ncaused by defendants’ conduct. \n37.  The claim entails an appropriate, judicially manageable remedy, namely, money damages \nwhich may be imposed on each of the defendants individually. \nCLAIM TWO — INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ PERSONAL LIABILITY  \nUNDER 42 U.S.C. §1983 FOR VIOLATION OF  \nTHE PLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS  \n \n38.  Plaintiffs re-allege and reincorporate paragraphs 1 through 37 herein. \n39.  Defendants, in addition to being employees of the federal government, were at all \nrelevant times acting as agents of, or in joint action with, the District of Columbia, for the \npurposes of assisting the D.C. police in the conduct of police operations during the mass \nprotests which occurred on September 27, 2002. \n40.  The U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia derived his authority over the plaintiff \nclass while they were in custody of the USMS and the deputy marshals pursuant to \nstatutes of the District of Columbia, including D.C. Code §§ 13-302, 16-703, 23-501, 23-\n561, and 23-581 and cooperative agreements entered into between the U.S. Marshals \nService and the Government of the District of Columbia pursuant to D.C. Code § 5-\n133.17.   \n41.  The operations of the USMDC are funded in part by the District of Columbia. \n42.  The USMDC and his deputies acted at all relevant times as the agents of, or in joint \naction with, the Government of the District of Columbia. \n \n12 \n\n \n43.  Individual defendants were following USMS policy, customs, and practices, which were \nthe moving force behind the deprivations of the plaintiff class members’ Fourth \nAmendment rights. \n44.  At all relevant times individual defendants were acting within the scope of their \nemployment, their acts were motivated by a desire to further the interests of the USMS, \nand such individuals were acting in furtherance of the business of the USMS. \n45.  Individual defendants proceeded under color of District of Columbia law to assume and \nretain custody of the plaintiffs and all members of the plaintiff class following their \ncustody of the D.C. Police. \n46.  Individual defendants proceeded under color of District of Columbia law to conduct the \naforementioned strip searches of the plaintiffs and all members of the plaintiff class. \n47.  Individual defendants are therefore liable under 42 U.S.C.§ 1983 for monetary damages \nfor subjecting all members of the plaintiff class to violations of their Fourth Amendment \nrights to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. \nCLAIM THREE — OFFICIAL CAPACITY LIABILITY OF \nJOHN CLARK OF THE UNITED STATES MARSHALS’ SERVICE \nAND UNITED STATES MARSHALL WALSH \nUNDER 42 U.S.C. §1983 FOR VIOLATION OF  \nTHE PLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS \n – FAILURE TO TRAIN \n \n48.  Plaintiffs re-allege and reincorporate paragraphs 1 through 47 herein. \n49.  USMS training of the deputy marshals was inadequate as to the well established legal  \nstandards with regard to what constitutes a lawful search of a prisoner, such that the \ndeputies’ handling of the custody and searches were clearly violative of plaintiffs’ rights. \n50.  The USMS and the U.S. Marshall, in his official capacity, showed deliberate indifference \n \n13 \n\n \nto the rights of the plaintiffs and the plaintiff class members by failing to train the deputy \nmarshals responsible for the custody of the plaintiff class members concerning the \nprocedures required for searches of protestors held in custody under Fourth Amendment \nstandards. \n51.  The violations on September 28, 2002 of plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights were \nforeseeable because of the USMS’s and the U.S. Marshal’s failures to train the deputy \nmarshals who conducted the searches. \n52.  The USMS and the U.S. Marshall were proceeding under color of D.C. law to hold and \ndetain the plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class on September 28, 2002, and as \nsuch were agents of, or in joint action with, the District of Columbia. \n53.  The USMS and the U.S. Marshall are liable to the plaintiffs under the Fourth \nAmendment, enforced under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for money damages arising from the \ninjuries suffered by the named plaintiffs and by each member of the plaintiff class as a \nresult of the unlawful strip searches. \nCLAIM FOUR — OFFICIAL CAPACITY LIABILITY OF  \nJOHN CLARK OF THE  UNITED STATES MARSHALS’ SERVICE \nAND UNITED STATES MARSHALL WALSH \nUNDER 42 U.S.C. §1983 FOR VIOLATION OF  \nTHE PLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS \n – UNLAWFUL OFFICIAL CUSTOM, POLICY, OR PRACTICE \n \n54.  Plaintiffs re-allege and reincorporate paragraphs 1 through 53 herein. \n55.  On information and belief, the USMS deputies proceeded on September 28, 2002 to \nconduct strip searches on the plaintiffs and plaintiff class members pursuant to a long-\nstanding custom, practice, or policy of the USMS of conducting such searches on persons \nin USMS custody following arrests in the District of Columbia during politically \n \n14 \n\n \ngrounded, mass protests. \n56.  The USMS and the U.S. Marshall were proceeding under color of D.C. law to hold and \ndetain the plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class on September 28, 2002, and as \nsuch were agents of or in joint action with the District of Columbia. \n57.  The USMS and the U.S. Marshall are liable to the plaintiffs under the Fourth \nAmendment, enforced under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for money damages arising from the \ninjuries suffered by the named plaintiffs and by each member of the plaintiff class as a \nresult of the unlawful strip searches. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant the following relief: \nA.  Enter an Order authorizing this matter to proceed as a class action, and certifying \nnamed plaintiffs Paul Bame, Ivan Welander, and Greg Keltner as representative \nplaintiffs, and designating the undersigned as class counsel, on behalf of the \nfollowing class: \neach man who was: (1) arrested on September 27, 2002 by the D.C. Police \nofficials during a series of mass protests in downtown Washington, D.C.; (2) \nremanded by D.C. Police, following that arrest, into the custody of the U.S. \nMarshal for the District of Columbia prior to being released; and (3) subjected by \ndeputy U.S. Marshals to a strip, visual, body cavity search without any \nparticularized or individualized reasonable suspicion that he was concealing \ndrugs, weapons or other contraband; (4)  excluding, however, all men arrested \nwithin the confines of Pershing Park on September 27, 2002. \n \n15 \n\n \nB.

Plaintiffs Paul Bame, Ivan Welander, and Greg Keltner bring this action on their own \nbehalf and on behalf of all other men who were arrested on September 27, 2002 during \nseveral large protests involving hundreds of people in downtown Washington, D.C, and \nwho were subjected to an unlawful strip search as described herein. On September 28, \n2002, several hours following their arrest, the men were subjected to unlawful strip \nsearches by defendants deputy U.S. Marshals acting under the supervision of Todd \nDillard, then the U.S. Marshall for the District of Columbia Superior Court. The strip \nsearches were conducted without reasonable, particularized, individualized suspicion in \nviolation of their Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and \nseizures. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over the this action and plaintiffs’ 42 U.S.C. §1983 and \nBivens claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3).   \n3.  Venue is appropriate in this District because each of the claims for relief arose in this \njudicial district. \n \nPARTIES PLAINTIFF \n4.  Plaintiff Paul Bame was arrested on charges of “incommoding” and two other minor \n \n2 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  33  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \ninfractions during a mass protest in Washington, D.C. on September 27, 2002. He was \narrested by officers of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia \n(“D.C. Police”), or officers of police departments acting under the supervision of the D.C.  \nPolice.   \na.  After his arrest he was initially held in custody of the D.C. Police and then was \ntransferred to the custody of deputy U.S. Marshals and held in their custody for \nseveral hours lasting into September 28, 2002. \nb.  While held in custody of the U.S. Marshals, several deputies conducted a strip \nsearch on him in the presence of eight to twelve other male arrestees, who were \nstrip searched at the same time.  The search performed on him was conducted \nwithout the deputies having any individualized, reasonable suspicion upon which \nto base a search. \nc.  He was released a few hours later after appearing before a judge at the federal \ncourthouse.  He was not required to post bond. \nd.  He is an adult resident of the State of Colorado.  \n5.  Plaintiff Greg Keltner was arrested during a mass protest in Washington, D.C. on \nSeptember 27, 2002. He was arrested by D.C. police officers, or officers of police \ndepartments acting under the supervision of the D.C.  Police.   \na.  After his arrest he was initially held in custody of the D.C.

Plaintiff Ivan Welander was arrested during a mass protest in Washington, D.C. on \nSeptember 27, 2002. He was arrested by D.C. police officers, or officers of police \ndepartments acting under the supervision of the D.C.  Police.   \na.  After his arrest he was initially held in custody of the D.C.

Defendant John F. Clark, is sued in his official capacity as the Acting Director of the \nUnited States Marshal’s Service (“USMS”), which is an agency of the United States \nGovernment. \n8.  Defendant Steve Conboy is sued in his official capacity as the United States Marshal for \nthe District of Columbia Superior Court (USMDC). \n9.  Defendant Todd Walther Dillard was the United States Marshal for the District of \nColumbia Superior Court at all times relevant to this action.  He is sued in his individual \ncapacity. \n10.  Defendants John Does 1 through 15 were, or are, deputy United States Marshals at all \ntimes relevant to this action.  They are each sued in their individual capacity. \n \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n11.  Named plaintiffs bring this action under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3) on \nbehalf of the class consisting of:  \na.  each man who was: (1) arrested on September 27, 2002 by the D.C. Police \nofficials during a series of mass protests in downtown Washington, D.C.; (2) \nremanded by D.C. Police, following that arrest, into the custody of the U.S. \nMarshal for the District of Columbia prior to being released; and (3) subjected by \ndeputy U.S. Marshals to a strip, visual, body cavity search without any \nparticularized or individualized reasonable suspicion that he was concealing \n \n5 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  66  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \ndrugs, weapons or other contraband; (4) excluding, however, all men arrested \nwithin the confines of Pershing Park on September 27, 2002. \n12.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The exact number \nof the class membership is not known.  However, records of the D.C. Superior Court \ndated September 28, 2002, entitled “IMF Mass Protest Lock Up List” list at least ninety \nmen.  On information and belief, at least half this number were arrested at mass protests \nother than at Pershing Park.  Thus, this class consists of at least 45 men, and possibly \nmore than one hundred men. \n13.  The class is manageable in that all members of the proposed class will be identifiable \nfrom records in the possession of defendants, and from other official records. \n14.  There are questions of fact and law which are common to all class members, and \ncommon to the claims of the named plaintiffs, including: \na.  What were the nature and extent of the strip searches conducted on every member \nof the plaintiffs class? \nb.  Whether the searches conducted by defendants on the plaintiff class members \ncomported with the standards provided under the Fourth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution? \nc.  What policies, customs, or practices resulted in the defendants conducting strip \nsearches on the plaintiff class members? \nd.  Whether the U.S. Marshal’s Service, the United States Marshal in his official \ncapacity, or former Marshal Dillard in his individual capacity, were deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of the class members by failing to train their staff \n \n6 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  77  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \nconcerning reasonable search procedures, sufficient to give rise to a claim against \nhim under 42 U.S.C. §1983? \ne.  Whether the law in the District of Columbia was sufficiently clearly established as \nof September, 2002 with regard to the legality of the strip searches conducted by \ndefendants, such that the defendants are not protected by any qualified immunity? \nf.  Whether the class members sustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of \nsuch damages? \ng.  Whether Defendants were acting as an agent of or in joint action with the District \nof Columbia, or otherwise acting under color of D.C. law? \n15.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the \nclass.   \na.  Named plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of all class members in that they \nwere each subjected to unlawful strip searches during the same mass arrest \nepisode of custody as the other class members, each of whom suffered a similar \nstrip search; \nb.  Named plaintiffs have no conflicts with the other class members; \nc.  There are no individual questions on the issue of liability, since every member of \nthe plaintiff class was subjected to a blanket strip search. \n16.  Named plaintiffs have retained counsel who have handled complex federal court class \nactions in various issue areas, including claims for unlawful strip searches of prisoners.   \na.  Lynn E. Cunningham has practiced law in the District of Columbia for thirty \nyears and handled successful class action litigation in the areas of welfare rights, \n \n7 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  88  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \nhealth benefits, housing rights, as well as prisoner’s rights.   \nb.  Zachary Wolfe has practiced law for five years in the District of Columbia, \nhandling a variety of cases, including successfully challenging illegal police \nactions with regard to public protests in D.C..  \nGENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n17.  On September 27, 2002, hundreds of persons, including plaintiff class members, staged a \nmass protest of certain federal agency policies in various locations in downtown \nWashington, D.C., including outside the International Monetary Fund headquarters, and \nvarious government agency and corporate headquarters buildings. \n18.  Hundreds of protestors, including plaintiff class members, were arrested by D.C. Police \nofficers, and police officials from other agencies acting under the direction of D.C. \npolice, and under the police powers of the Government of the District of Columbia. \n19.  After being held in the custody of the D.C. Police for many hours, the plaintiff class \nmembers and other arrestees were remanded by D.C. Police officials to the defendants \nduring the night of September 27, 2002 and then held in custody in holding cells of the \nD.C. Superior Courthouse for the District of Columbia, awaiting arraignment on the \ncriminal charges lodged against them. \n20.  Plaintiffs and plaintiff class members were held in the custody of USMS, and in the \nphysical custody of the individual defendants until the charges alleged against them could \nbe determined, judicially or otherwise.  This determination occurred during the day on \nSeptember 28, 2002.   \n21.  While in the custody of the USMS, each and every plaintiff class member, and other \n \n8 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  99  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \narrestees, was subjected to strip searches in spite of the marshals having no individualized \nreasonable suspicion for doing so.   \n22.  On information and belief, defendant Dillard and the USMS deputies conducted the \nuniform, blanket strip searches of each and every class member male arrestee on \nSeptember 28, 2002 pursuant to an official USMS custom, policy or practice. \n23.  The strip searches conducted on the plaintiffs and plaintiff class members entailed the \nfollowing actions: \na.  Small teams of defendants took aside small groups of eight to twelve plaintiff \nclass members into a separate holding area; \nb.  Plaintiffs were ordered to drop their trousers and underpants, face a wall, and to \nsquat down and cough in front of the deputy marshals; \nc.  No contraband was found on any class member; \nd.  On information and belief, no records were made by the defendants of the results \nof the strip searches. \ne.  Plaintiffs, and on information and belief, Plaintiff class members, were subjected \nto pat-down searches and visual inspection repeatedly and were in close physical \nproximity to other arrested persons as well as law enforcement over a period of \nhours prior to the strip search complained of herein. \n24.  The strip searches were intimidating, humiliating, and subjected each class member to \nstrong emotional distress. \n25.  On information and belief, defendants’ conduct of the said searches was malicious and \nrecklessly indifferent to the rights and interests of the named plaintiffs and of all the \n \n9 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  1100  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \nmembers of the class. \n26.  Within a few hours after the strip searches were conducted, each class member was \nreleased either under bond, after pleading guilty to a minor offense such as failure to obey \na police officer or “incommoding,” or without any charge being advanced against him. \n27.  No class member was tried or convicted of any felony or crime involving violence or \ndrug charges in connection with the arrests on September 27, 2002. \n28.  Both male and female protest arrestees were subjected to the searches.  On information \nand belief, the women’s claims with regard to strip searches are addressed under separate \nlitigation.   \n29.  On information and belief, claims of persons arrested at Pershing Park protests on that \nday are also addressed under separate litigation. \n \nCLAIM ONE – BIVENS PERSONAL LIABILITY OF  \nFORMER UNITED STATES MARSHALL TODD WALTHER DILLARD  \nAND OF UNITED STATES MARSHALL SERVICE  \nEMPLOYEES DOES 1-15 FOR  \nVIOLATION OF FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS. \n \n30.  Plaintiffs re-allege and reincorporate paragraphs 1 through 29 herein.  \n31.  Named plaintiffs and every member of the plaintiff class have a right protected under the \nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution not to be subjected to unreasonable \nsearches and seizures by persons acting under United States and District of Columbia \ngovernmental authority. \n32.  The said protection includes the right of an arrestee held on a non-drug, non-violent \noffense in police custody not to be subjected to a strip search in the absence of an \n \n10 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  1111  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \nindividualized, reasonable suspicion on the part of the searching officer that there is a \nbasis for the search. \n33.  Defendants Dillard and John Does numbers 1 through 15 violated that right, while acting \nin their capacity as U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia Superior Court and deputy \nU.S. Marshals by conducting on each named plaintiff and each member of the plaintiff \nclass a search on September 28, 2002, consisting of the one or more of the defendants \npersonally ordering each individual plaintiff to remove his clothing and exposing private \nparts of his body to a full visual inspection by one or more of the defendants, in the \npresence of other class members. \n34.  The defendants conducted the said searches in the absence of any reasonable, \nindividualized suspicion that any plaintiff was secreting any form of contraband on his \nperson. \n35.  Defendants violated clearly established law in conducting the searches:    \na.  Washington, D.C. had been the site of large scale protests for decades prior to \nSeptember, 2002. \nb.  These protests have resulted many times in arrests of large numbers of protestors.  \nc.  Courts had ruled in previous decades on the proper standards for the police \ntreatment of arrested protestors, and held that certain forms of highly intrusive \nsearches of such arrestees’ persons were violative of Fourth Amendment \nstandards. \nd.  As a result, the law governing what constitutes a reasonable ground for strip \nsearching a prisoner had, as of 2002, long been clearly established in the District \n \n11 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  1122  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \nof Columbia, and, in particular, the illegality of conducting strip searches without \nany individualized, reasonable suspicion upon which to ground the searches. \ne.  The defendants conducted the searches when acting under governmental \nauthority. \nf.  The defendants had fair notice of the applicable legal standard for the conduct of \nstrip searches of prisoners. The plaintiffs were non-violent, non-felon, non-drug-\nrelated prisoners, who had been arrested in the course of a peaceful protest against \ngovernment policies.  \ng.  All the searches were highly invasive strip searches  \n36.   There are no special factors to suggest to that the Court should decline to provide a \nspecial cause of action or a remedy for the defendants’ violations of plaintiffs’ rights. \n37.  Individual defendants are each individually and directly liable under the Fourth \nAmendment to each member of the plaintiff class for monetary damages for the injuries \ncaused by defendants’ conduct. \n38.  The claim entails an appropriate, judicially manageable remedy, namely, money damages \nwhich may be imposed on each of the defendants individually. \n \nCLAIM TWO — INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ PERSONAL LIABILITY  \nUNDER 42 U.S.C. §1983 FOR VIOLATION OF  \nTHE PLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS  \n \n39.  Plaintiffs re-allege and reincorporate paragraphs 1 through 38 herein. \n40.  Defendants, in addition to being employees of the federal government, were at all \nrelevant times acting as agents of, or in joint action with, the District of Columbia, for the \n \n12 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  1133  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \npurposes of assisting the D.C. police in the conduct of police operations during the mass \nprotests which occurred on September 27, 2002. \n41.  The U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia Superior Court derived his authority over \nthe plaintiff class while they were in custody of the USMS and the deputy marshals \npursuant to statutes of the District of Columbia, including D.C. Code §§ 13-302, 16-703, \n23-501, 23-561, and 23-581 and cooperative agreements entered into between the U.S. \nMarshals Service and the Government of the District of Columbia pursuant to D.C. Code \n§ 5-133.17.   \n42.  The operations of the USMDC are and were at all relevant times funded in part by the \nDistrict of Columbia. \n43.  The USMDC and his deputies acted at all relevant times as the agents of, or in joint \naction with, the Government of the District of Columbia. \n44.  Individual defendants were following USMS and USMDC policy, customs, and \npractices, which were the moving force behind the deprivations of the plaintiff class \nmembers’ Fourth Amendment rights. \n45.  At all relevant times individual defendants were acting within the scope of their \nemployment, their acts were motivated by a desire to further the interests of the USMS \nand USMDC, and such individuals were acting in furtherance of the business of the \nUSMS and USMDC. \n46.  Individual defendants proceeded under color of District of Columbia law to assume and \nretain custody of the plaintiffs and all members of the plaintiff class following their \ncustody of the D.C. Police. \n \n13 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  1144  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \n47.  Individual defendants proceeded under color of District of Columbia law to conduct the \naforementioned strip searches of the plaintiffs and all members of the plaintiff class. \n48.  Individual defendants are therefore liable under 42 U.S.C.§ 1983 for monetary damages \nfor subjecting all members of the plaintiff class to violations of their Fourth Amendment \nrights to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. \nCLAIM THREE — OFFICIAL CAPACITY LIABILITY OF \nJOHN CLARK OF THE UNITED STATES MARSHALS’ SERVICE \nAND UNITED STATES MARSHALL STEVE CONBOY \nUNDER 42 U.S.C. §1983 FOR VIOLATION OF  \nTHE PLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS \n – FAILURE TO TRAIN \n \n49.  Plaintiffs re-allege and reincorporate paragraphs 1 through 48 herein. \n50.  USMS training of the deputy marshals was inadequate as to the well-established legal  \nstandards with regard to what constitutes a lawful search of a prisoner, such that the \ndeputies’ handling of the custody and searches were clearly violative of plaintiffs’ rights. \n51.  The USMS and the U.S. Marshal for D.C. Superior Court, in his official capacity, showed \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of the plaintiffs and the plaintiff class members by \nfailing to train the deputy marshals responsible for the custody of the plaintiff class \nmembers concerning the procedures required for searches of protestors held in custody \nunder Fourth Amendment standards. \n52.  The violations on September 28, 2002 of plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights were \nforeseeable because of the USMS’s and the U.S. Marshal’s failures to train the deputy \nmarshals who conducted the searches. \n53.  The USMS and the U.S. Marshal for D.C. Superior Court were proceeding under color of \nD.C. law to hold and detain the plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class on September \n \n14 \n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011883333--EEGGSS          DDooccuummeenntt  78          FFiilleedd  1100//2288//22000055          PPaaggee  1155  ooff  1188(cid:10)(cid:10)\n \n28, 2002, and as such were agents of, or in joint action with, the District of Columbia. \n54.  The USMS and the U.S. Marshall for D.C.

Police \nofficials during a series of mass protests in downtown Washington, D.C.; (2) \nremanded by D.C. Police, following that arrest, into the custody of the U.S. \nMarshal for the District of Columbia prior to being released; and (3) subjected by \ndeputy U.S. Marshals to a strip, visual, body cavity search without any \nparticularized or individualized reasonable suspicion that he was concealing \ndrugs, weapons or other contraband; (4) excluding, however, all men arrested \nwithin the confines of Pershing Park on September 27, 2002. \n \n  The grounds for this motion are, first, the number of persons in the class are so numerous, \ni.e., over 90 men, that class treatment is the most effective means of adjudicating their claims \nagainst defendants.  Second, named plaintiffs and all the class members share siginifcant \ncommon issues in their claims, and these issues predominate over any issues pertaining to any \nindividual plaintiffs.  Third, the claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the \nclass as a whole.  Fourth, the named plaintiffs and their counsel will adequately represent the \n  1 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 2 of 25(cid:10)\n \nclass.  Counsel are experienced in handling class action litigation.  Finally, for purposes of \ntreatment of the class claims under Rule 23(b)(3), the class is manageable, notice to the class can \nbe readily achieved, and the issue of how to treat individual damages does not predominate over \nthe other issues raised by plaintiffs’ claims, making class treatment of these claims superior to \nany other approach. \n  A memorandum of points and authorities and a proposed Order are submitted in support \nthis motion.  \n  Plaintiffs’ counsel have consulted by email with defense counsel, pursuant to Local Rule \n7(m), as to whether defendants might consent to this motion, and they have not yet responded as \nof the filing date of this motion. \n  Wherefore, plaintiffs’ respectfully request that the Court grant this motion for class \ncertification.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/Lynn E.

The men had been arrested by members of the \nD.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), and cooperating police officers, at a large scale, \nwidespread, political protest held in Washington, D.C. on September 27, 2002 near the \nheadquarters for the International Monetary Fund.  All the men were arrested for failing to obey \npolice orders, or similar minor offenses, while protesting near the intersection of Connecticut \nAvenue and K Street, N.W. and nearby areas, other than Pershing Park where other protests were \n  4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 5 of 25(cid:10)\n \nheld.1  Following their arrest, the men were held with arrestees from other protests for several \nhours in the custody of the D.C. police before being turned over to the custody of the deputy \nmarshals, who are defendants herein.  The deputy marshals proceeded to hold them in custody \nfor several additional hours, before conducting the strip searches complained of herein.  Shortly \nafter the searches were conducted, the men appeared before D.C. Superior Court judicial \nofficers, and were released upon “post and forfeit” or upon “citation release”.  Several hundred \nother persons, men and women, were also arrested within Pershing Park, but they are not part of \nthis action.  Some number of women were arrested with the proposed class of men, and they too \nare not part of this action because their claims are addressed in other litigation.2   \nPlaintiffs seek the Court’s approval of a class defined as follows: \nAll men who were: (1) arrested on September 27, 2002 by the D.C. Police officials during a \nseries of mass protests in downtown Washington, D.C.; (2) remanded by D.C. Police, \nfollowing that arrest, into the custody of the U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia prior to \nbeing released; and (3) subjected by deputy U.S. Marshals to a strip, visual, body cavity \nsearch without any particularized or individualized reasonable suspicion that he was \nconcealing drugs, weapons or other contraband; (4) excluding, however, all men arrested \nwithin the confines of Pershing Park on September 27, 2002. \n \n  The proposed class of men herein are most likely members of the plaintiff class certified \nby this Court in one other suit against the D.C. government and certain of its officials, and \nvarious federal agencies and officials. Diamond, et al. v. District of Columbia, Civil Action 03-\n2005(EGS) (D.D.C., class certified March 3, 2004).  Moreover, additional related litigation has \n                                                 \n1  The factual allegations recounted in this and the following two paragraphs are set forth in the Amended \nComplaint[8]. The Court has taken note of the widespread demonstrations in Washington, D.C. and related mass \narrests in its opinion certifying classes in Barham v Ramsey, and Chang et al. v U.S. et al, 217 F.R.D. 262 (2003). \n2  Johnson et al. v. D.C. et al., Civil Action No. 02-2364 (RMC) where a class of female plaintiffs are \nchallenging the long-standing practice of the marshals in D.C. of strip searching certain categories of female \narrestees, but not male arrestees. \n  5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 6 of 25(cid:10)\n \nbeen filed to challenge other aspects of the police handling of other parts of the protest, \nparticularly arrests occurring in Pershing Park. Barham v Ramsey and Chang et al v. U.S. et al., \nsupra.  However, none of these other actions entail the claims raised herein.  In other words, \nnone of the other suits raise claims for monetary damages against defendants herein, i.e., the U.S. \nMarshal in his official capacity, the U.S. Marshal’s Service, former marshal Todd Dillard in his \nindividual capacity, or the various unknown deputy marshals who actually conducted the \nsearches on the proposed class of men arrested outside of Pershing Park on September 27, 2002.   \nPaul Bame, Greg Keltner, and Ivan Welander, the three named plaintiffs herein, all were present \nwith the other men and women at the protest at Connecticut and K Street or other nearby protest \nsites, were not arrested at Pershing Park on September 27, 2002, were arrested for minor offenses \nat protests outside of Pershing Park, and all were transferred from the custody of the MPD to the \ncustody of the deputy U.S. marshals before being strip searched shortly before their court \nreleases.   \n  The parties in the related litigation as well as the Court, have had opportunity to develop \naspects of the factual record with regard to the protests and arrests that occurred on September \n27, 2002.  That record need not be repeated in detail here.  Nevertheless, that record, insofar as it \nhas been developed thus far, corroborates the essentials of the allegations made in the Amended \nComplaint herein [8].  The protests, of which the proposed class of men were a part, were \npolitical in nature, were non-violent, and involved engagement in free speech by the protestors.  \nPolice arrests of the protestors were either entirely illegal, or were arrests not for crimes that \nmight serve as the basis for strip searches of the arrestees while in police custody. The arrestees \nwere held in police custody, were not intermingled with other non-protesting arrestees, and all \n  6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 7 of 25(cid:10)\n \nwere released without significant legal punishment, either in the form of being fined, or \nsentenced.  \n  The Court has already certified classes in the “related”  cases just mentioned.3 There is \nevery reason to certify the class herein as well, as this memorandum will demonstrate.  \nResolution of the class members’ damages claims are best resolved on a class-wide, group basis.  \nThere are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because defendants treated all \nplaintiffs similarly, and, to plaintiffs’ knowledge, did not keep records of the results of the \nsearches.  Once the plaintiffs establish the fact of the strip searches, and the existence of the \npolicies and practices applied, the burden will fall on the defendants to demonstrate, as an \naffirmative defense, that particular searches were reasonable.  Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 \nF.R.D. 16, 24 (D. Mass. 2000).  Therefore, defendants can not show that any of the searches \nwere conducted based on an individual determination of reasonable suspicion.  On the issue of \ndamages, the Court may bifurcate the liability phase of the case from the relief phase, as \ndiscussed below. Alternatively, the Court is empowered to conduct sample trials to determine the \namount of damages due each class member, again as discussed below. \n \nLAW APPLICABLE TO THE CLASS;  \nTHE PROPOSED CLASS MERITS CERTIFICATION  \n \nThis and Other Courts Have Certified Classes in Similar Cases \n  Courts have regularly certified classes in arrest cases where arrestees challenge a policy \nor pattern of conduct of the arrest and initial detention procedures that affects all or an \n  7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 8 of 25(cid:10)\n \nascertainable segment of an arrestee population. Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167 (D.C. Cir. \n1977); Washington Mobilization Cttee v. Cullinane, 400 F. Supp. 186 (D.D.C. 1975), aff’d in \npart, rev’d in part, 566 F.2d 107 (D.C. Cir. 1977); Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 31 (1st \nCir. 2003). \n  On facts parallel in relevant aspects to this case, other courts on many occasions have \ncertified similar classes of pre-trial detainees subjected to unlawful strip searches.4  Maneely v. \nCity of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y. 2002)(certification granted of class challenging \npolicy of conducting blanket strip searches of pretrial arraignment prisoners); Mack v. Suffolk \nCounty, 191 F.R.D. 16, 17 (D. Mass. 2000) (certification granted to class of female arrestees \nchallenging a policy of subjecting all female arrestees to blanket strip searches);  Johns v. \nDeLeonardis, 145 F.R.D. 480 (N.D. Ill. 1992) (class certified where approximately twenty-five \nwomen were subjected to illegal strip search by Chicago police officers in a police raid).  \n  Moreover, this and other Courts have certified classes of prisoners unlawfully strip \nsearched during incarceration or pending release following a judicial finding that a prisoner was \neligible for release.  Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004)(affirming grant of class \ncertification to class of detainees challenging jail strip search policies);  Bynum v. District of \nColumbia, 257 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2002)(RCL)(class certified of in-custody defendants who \nwere returned to DC Jail for out-processing and subjected to suspicionless strip searches after a \n                                                                                                                                                             \n3  The Court in Johnson v D.C., supra, has denied the motion for class certification without \nprejudice because the matter was referred to mediation. \n4  The classic definition of a strip search is the exposure of the naked body for inspection, \nthe most invasive version of which is the visual body cavity strip search.  See e.g., Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).   \n \n  8 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 9 of 25(cid:10)\n \njudge had ordered their release state a claim under the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth \nAmendment); Masters v.

County of Montgomery, 2005 U.S. \nDist.

Wis. 2003)(granting class certification to class of strip search plaintiffs); \nMack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000); Gary v. Sheahan, 1999 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 5616 (E.D.

Calumet City, Illinois, 754 F. Supp. 1211(N.D. Illinois 1990) (summary judgment granted \nto class of strip searched female arrestees).  \n  Judge Green certified a class of all current and future women inmates in the District of \nColumbia Department of Corrections challenging guard on inmate sexual misconduct and other \nprison conditions under Rule 23(a), 23(b)(1) and 23(b)(2).  Women Prisoners of District of \nColumbia Department of Corrections v. District of Columbia, 877 F. Supp. 634, 635 (D.D.C. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 10 of 25(cid:10)\n \nDecember 13, 1994) rev’d in part, aff’d in part, 93 F.3d 910 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (certification of \nclass not part of appeal). \n \nThe Court’s Authority to Certify Class Actions and Subclasses \n  Rule 23 provides for class action treatment of claims when the named plaintiffs can show \nthat all the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, and that the class falls within one of the \ncategories of Rule 23(b).5  Pigford v. Glickman, 182 F.R.D. 341 (D.D.C. 1998); \nFranklin v. Barry, 909 F. Supp 21, 30 (D.D.C. 1995)(citing 7A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal \nPractice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1759, at 102 (1986)). \n  Class actions have two primary purposes: (1) to accomplish judicial economy by \navoiding multiple suits; and (2) to protect the rights of persons who might not be able to present \nclaims on an individual basis.  See, e.g., Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345 (1983).   \nThe United States Supreme Court has endorsed the class action procedure as a superior method \nof adjudicating cases like this where there are numerous claims that are too small to litigate \nindividually.  Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 809 (1985)(\"Rule 23 is given \nliberal rather than restrictive construction, and courts are to adopt a standard of flexibility . . .\").  \nSharif ex rel. Salahuddin v. New York State Educ. Dep't., 127 F.R.D. 84, 87 (S.D.N.Y. 1989).  \n                                                 \n5  The class in the instant case is likewise readily determinable and definable.  For \ndiscussions of the requirement in this circuit that this standard be met, see, Franklin v. Barry, \n909 F. Supp. at 30; Keepseagle v. Veneman, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25220, Civil Action No. 99-\n3119, mem. op. at 1011 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2001) (citations omitted);  Barham v.

Most of the cases would too small to be \nlitigated individually. The District Court in Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n8643 (S.D.N.Y.) granted certification of a class solely on the issue of whether defendant \nmaintained a policy of conducting blanket strip searches of pretrial arraignment prisoners.   \n  The plaintiffs propose the creation of a class in this case because the members share \nseveral common questions, primarily whether the defendants maintained a policy or practice of \nconducting blanket strip searches and visual body cavity searches on class members following \ntheir arrest on September 27, 2002. The plaintiffs propose the recognition of a class in this case, \nrather than filing separate actions, for reasons of manageability and judicial economy.   \n  This strip search class is especially well suited to class treatment.  Federal Courts in the \nDistrict of Columbia, Boston, Chicago, as well as New York and Maine, have certified similar \nclasses. Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983); Byum v.

See Maneely, supra;   \nKennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir. 1989)(invalidating policy requiring \nvisual body cavity searches of all felony arrestees regardless of reasonable suspicion), and the \nFirst Circuit says the rule applies to arrestees arrested on minor charges even when they will be \nheld in a maximum security prison and intermingled with persons serving felony sentences, \nSavard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 2003)(holding policy of strip-searching persons \narrested for non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanors, in the absence of particularized \nsuspicion, violated the Constitution, even where the arrestees will be intermingled with the \ngeneral population in a maximum security prison, but granting qualified immunity to officers for \nsearches that occurred before March 17, 2000).   \n \nPresumptions applicable to motion for certification \n  In a class certification motion, plaintiffs’ allegations in the complaint are taken as true, \nand inquiry into the merits of the case is improper except to determine whether there is a realistic \nclaim.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1974); Curtin v. United Airlines, \nInc., 275 F.3d 88, 92 (C.A.D.C. 2001) (citing Eisen, 417 U.S. at 177); Blackie v.

Rule 23(a) are commonality, numerosity, typicality of \nclaims, and adequacy of representation.  The plaintiffs must meet the certification requirements \nindependently. Alexander v. FBI, 971 F. Supp. 603 (D.D.C. 1997); Pigford, 182 F.R.D. 341, 346 \n(D.D.C. 1998).   \n \nPlaintiffs Meet the Numerosity Requirement.  \n  “Lock Up Lists” were prepared by MPD officers at the Blue Plains holding facility where \nnamed plaintiffs and members of the proposed plaintiff class were taken after their arrests.  \nThese lists show ninety-two persons with male names, or listed by the male name of “John Doe”, \na strong indicator that the arrestee was a male person.  These lists are sufficient evidence at this \nstage of the proceedings of the number of men who constitute the proposed class.  The lists are \nattached as Exhibit 1.   \n  In addition, named plaintiff Paul Bame is prepared to testify that he personally witnessed \nat least eighty men from the protests held in the two cell blocks at the D.C. Superior courthouse \nfacilities under the supervision of the deputy marshals dozens; that he was strip searched in a \nbatch of eight to twelve men; and that he understood that all the men held in the two cell-blocks \nwere strip searched in batches by defendant marshals on the morning of September 28, 2002.  \n  13 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 14 of 25(cid:10)\n \nGreg Keltner is prepared to testify that he was processed by the deputy marshals on the morning \nof September 28, 2002 along with a batch of at least 30 other men from the protest arrests, all of \nwhom were strip searched in small groups.  \n  Moreover, the Court has certified two sub-classes totaling several hundred persons in the \nDiamond v. D.C., supra, class action and it is likely that many of the male members of those \nclasses are members of the proposed class herein. \n  Whatever may be the final tally of members of the propose class, numerosity is present \nhere, since there are at least thirty, and more likely at least ninety, members of the class. \n  To satisfy the numerosity requirement, plaintiffs need only show that the number of \nproposed class members is sufficiently large such that it would be extremely difficult or \ninconvenient to join all the members of the class.  Moreover, the proposed class is dispersed \nacross the country, making joinder impracticable.   Chang v. U.S., 217 F.R.D. 262 (D.D.C. \n2003); Franklin v. Barry, 909 F. Supp. at 30-31, (citing Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 \n(2d Cir. 1993));  Kifafi v. Hilton Hotels Retirement Plan, 189 F.R.D. 174, 176 (D.D.C. 1999); \nPigford v.

Printing Industry of Metropolitan Washington, D.C., Inc., 92 F.R.D. 51, 53 (D.D.C. \n1981).   \n  Ninety-two persons is a sufficient number to satisfy the numerosity requirement, as \nwould be thirty persons.  The numerosity requirement “does not require immense numbers of \nplaintiffs.  Nor does it require that the exact number of class members or their identities be \nalleged.” Johns v. DeLeonardis, 145 F.R.D. 480 (N.D. Ill. 1992) (numerosity requirement \nsatisfied and class certified where approximately twenty-five women were subjected to illegal \n  14 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 15 of 25(cid:10)\n \nstrip search by Chicago police officers in a police raid; citing Swanson v. American Consumer \nIndus., 415 F.2d 1326, 1333 n.9 (7th Cir. 1969) (class of forty would have been acceptable)); \nPatrykus v. Gomilla, 121 F.R.D.  357, 361 (N.D. Ill.  1988) (class of 50 sufficient)).  To satisfy \nthe numerosity requirement, “Plaintiffs need only show that the number is sufficiently large such \nthat it would be extremely difficult or inconvenient to join all the members of the class.”  \nFranklin, 909 F. Supp. at 30.  This Court has held that generally 40 members will satisfy the \nnumerosity requirement.  Neal v. Moore, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21339, *24 (D.D.C. 1994).   \n  The party moving to certify the class need not supply the exact number of the class \nmembers.   Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 33, citing Kifafi v. Hilton Hotels Retirement Plan, 189 F.R.D. \n174, 176 (D.D.C. 1999) (\"So long as there is a reasonable basis for the estimate provided, the \nnumerosity requirement can be satisfied without precise numbers.\") .    \n  A more refined number of class members herein will be determined upon further \ndiscovery. \n \nThe Class Presents Common Issues of Law and Fact. \n  The commonality test is met where there is at least one issue, the resolution of which will \naffect all or a significant number of the putative class members.   Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 33;  \nKifafi, 189 F.R.D. at 176-77.  This case presents several issues, each of which is common to each \nmember of the class: \n1.  What were the nature and extent of the strip searches conducted on every member of the \nplaintiffs class? \n  15 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 16 of 25(cid:10)\n \n2.  Whether the searches conducted by defendants on the plaintiff class members comported \nwith the standards provided under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution?6 \n3.  What policies, customs, or practices resulted in the defendants conducting strip searches \non the plaintiff class members? \n4.  Whether the U.S. Marshal’s Service, the United States Marshal in his official capacity, or \nformer Marshal Dillard in his individual capacity, were deliberately indifferent to the rights of \nthe class members by failing to train their staff concerning reasonable search procedures, \nsufficient to give rise to a claim against them under 42 U.S.C. §1983? \n5.  Whether the law in the District of Columbia was sufficiently clearly established as of \nSeptember, 2002 with regard to the legality of the strip searches conducted by defendants, such \nthat the defendants are not protected by any qualified immunity? \n6.  Whether the class members sustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such \ndamages? \n7.  Whether Defendants were acting as an agent of, or in joint action with, the District of \nColumbia, or otherwise acting under color of D.C. law? \n  There are no individual fact questions on the issue of liability, because apparently none of \nthe defendants kept records of the searches.  Therefore, once plaintiffs establish a policy and \npractice of the searches, none of the defendants will have evidence to show that any of the \n                                                 \n6  Significantly, as plaintiffs are prepared to show in later filings, every single one of the twelve federal \ncircuits, except for the Third Circuit (and not counting the Federal Circuit), have held that the Fourth Amendment \nprohibits strip searches of arrestees and detainees charged with non-drug misdemeanors and other minor offenses \nwithout an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that the person being searched is concealing drugs, \nweapons or other contraband.  See also, e.g., Helton v. U.S., 191 F. Supp.2d 179, 184-5 (D.D.C. 2002);  Bynum v. \nD.C., 257 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2002)(denying D.C. motion to dismiss claims for strip searches of persons ordered \nreleased). \n  16 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 17 of 25(cid:10)\n \nsearches were conducted based on an individual determination of reasonable suspicion.  Once \nplaintiffs establish the existence of a policy or practice, the burden will fall on the defendants to \ndemonstrate, as an affirmative defense, that particular searches were reasonable.  See, e.g., \nBynum, supra; Helton, supra;  Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 24 (D. Mass. 2000).   \n \nNamed Plaintiffs Raise Claims Typical of the Proposed Class. \n  Named plaintiffs’ claims are typical because they arise from the same practice or course \nof conduct by the defendants, and they are based on the same legal theory as those raised by all \nclass members.  Bynum v. D.C., 214 F.R.D. at 34; Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 22; Stewart v. Rubin, 948 \nF. Supp. at 1088. The named plaintiffs satisfy this requirement because each of them and each \nmember of the class has the same legal theory based on the same pattern of facts: each class \nsuffered Constitutional injury because each one was subjected to standardized searches \nconducted by defendants in connection with arrests which were, in turn, based on minor, non-\nviolent infractions by persons engaged in a mass protest, all without any individualized, \nreasonable suspicion upon which to base such searches. As set forth in the First Amended \nComplaint, each of the named plaintiffs, Paul Bame, Gregory Keltner, and Ivan Welander were \narrested for minor infractions with the other class members on September 27, 2002, and held in \nthe custody of the D.C. Police officers.  Early in the morning of September 28, 2002, they were \ntransferred to the custody of deputy U.S. Marshals, and subjected by those deputies to a full body \nstrip search, without any individualized, reasonable suspicion upon which to base such searches.  \nA few hours later, all members of the class, including the three named plaintiffs, were released \nby a judicial officer of D.C. Superior Court.   \n  17 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 18 of 25(cid:10)\n \n \nThe Proposed Class Is Adequately Represented. \n  Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the class have adequate representation. Bynum, 214 at 35; 7 \nChang, 217 F.R.D. at 273; Coleman v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 196 F.R.D. 193, 198 \n(D.D.C. 2000); Pigford, 182 F.R.D. at 350; Kifafi, 189 F.R.D. at 177; Vargas, 119 F.R.D. at 295.  \nThis requirement is met when there is no conflict of interest between the legal interests of the \nnamed plaintiffs and those of the proposed class.   Additionally, counsel for the plaintiffs must be \ncompetent to represent the class. \n  In this case, no conflicts of interest exist between the representative plaintiffs and the \nproposed class.  The named plaintiffs seek to redress the deprivation of rights conferred upon \nthem and on all class members by the United States Constitution.  The representative plaintiffs’ \ninterests do not conflict with those of the putative class.  Just the opposite, the issues presented \nby the named representatives mirror those faced by the putative class, which stands only to gain \nby this action. \n  Plaintiffs’ counsel are competent to represent the members of the class with great vigor \nand adequate resources.  Two attorneys with years of experience handling class actions will \nprovide the legal representation in this case.  \n                                                 \n7  The Court in Bynum noted: “ ‘Two criteria for determining the adequacy of \nrepresentation are generally recognized: 1) the named representative must not have antagonistic \nor conflicting interests with the unnamed members of the class, and 2) the representative must \nappear able to vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.’\".  \nAccord, Twelve John Does v.

The \nonly significant individual factual issue is the amount of damages for each member of the class.  \nHowever, the existence of individual damage calculations does not make individual damages \npredominate over the common issues.  McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 239 U.S. App. D.C. 247, 741 \nF.2d 1406, 1410, 1413(D.C. Cir. 1984)(class certification permissible even in the presence of \nindividual damages claims).  Bynum v.

Ill.)(District Court denied defendants’ motion to decertify the class of women \narrestees subject to blanket strip search, as to damages.);  Smilow v. Southwestern Bell Mobile \n  20 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 21 of 25(cid:10)\n \nSystem 323 F.3d 32, 39-40(1st Cir. 2003); In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust Litigation, \n280 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied, Visa U.S.A.

Met-Coil Systems Corp., 319 F.3d 910, 912 (7th Cir. 2003). \n \nTreatment as a Class Action Is Superior. \n  The primary consideration in determining whether a class action is “superior” is the \navailability and viability of other possible ways of handing the claims raised.   \nHandling this matter through a series of individual cases is a possible, but inferior alternative.   \nFirst, the individual class members are widely dispersed geographically. Second, the filing of \nindividual claims, possibly through the retainer of separate counsel, risks the Court entering \ndifferent relief for different individual plaintiffs.  Third, the Court and counsel would have to \nmake a wide array of duplicate findings of fact and conclusions of law in a series of individual \nactions.  Damages in individual cases may  be inadequate to attract sufficient counsel to \nrepresent individuals on a case-by-case basis.  Moreover, even if separate counsel were available, \nmanaging dozens of individually filed lawsuits would create a serious administrative challenge \nfor the Court, as well as for the array of counsel needed to handle the series of cases.  In short, \nthe class action is the superior proceeding. \n  Another alternative is for the Court to bifurcate the liability and damages phases of the \ncase, certify a class for liability purposes, and then require the parties to try the damages claims \nfor each individual claim.  Several mass damages claims such as this have been tried using \nsample trials to determine the amount of damages liability.  Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, \n  21 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 22 of 25(cid:10)\n \n103 F.3d 767 (9th Cir. 1996).  Determination of damages is manageable without destroying the \ncohesiveness of the class because damages can be determined by: (1) establishing class-wide \ndamages on an aggregate basis in a single trial using a schedule or statistical sampling, (2) by \nmini-trials before judges or magistrates; or, (3) by a claims procedure agreed upon by the parties. \nSee, Neal v. Director, D.C. Dep't of Corrections, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11543 (D.D.C. 1995) \n(discussing methods of establishing damages for class members after liability determination).  \nThere is a trend in favor of using such aggregate damage trials.  3 Newberg 10.5 at 483-487 (4th \ned. 2002); Blue Cross & Blue Shield of N.J., Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 133 F. Supp. 2d 162, 169 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2001); Long v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 761 F. Supp. 1320, 1326 (N.D. Ill. 1991); \nLangley v. Coughlin, 715 F. Supp. 522, 531 (S.D.N.Y. 1989); A Model Plan To Resolve Federal \nClass Action Cases By Jury Trial, 88 VA. L. REV. 405 (2002).   \n  In short, once liability is established in a case such as this, where the individual class \nmembers were subjected to essentially the same strip searches at the same time, trial of the \namount of damages for each class member should prove highly manageable. \n \nNature and Extent of Any Litigation Already Commenced \n  For reasons unknown to plaintiffs’ counsel or to the named plaintiffs, the other litigation \nalready commenced with regard to claims arising from the mass protests held on September 27, \n2002 in Washington, D.C. have not addressed the claims raised herein.  Many months have \npassed since those cases were filed, yet the parties in those cases apparently have  chosen not to \nraise the claims made herein.  Thus, those lawsuits will not result in issue preclusion for the \n  22 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 23 of 25(cid:10)\n \nclaims herein, nor provide the specific relief sought herein.  Accordingly, no reason exists under \nFRCP Rule 23 to prevent this matter going forward while the other litigation is pending. \n \nDesirability of concentrating the Litigation in One Forum \n  This case and the other related cases are all filed in the forum covering the venue where \nthe mass protests took place and where the actions of defendants in response to the mass protests \noccurred.  There is no other forum that would be more appropriate.  Individual members of the \nproposed class are dispersed geographically throughout the country.  Indeed, two of the three \nnamed plaintiffs reside within the State of Wisconsin, and the third resides in Colorado.  They \nhave consented to filing the action in this forum. \n \nThe Class is Manageable. \n  As stated, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability regarding the class of \nplaintiffs because apparently none of the defendants kept records of the searches complained of, \nand therefore none of the defendants can show that any of the searches were conducted based on \nan individual determination of reasonable suspicion.  The only facts which plaintiffs will have to \nshow are the circumstances of the arrests and detention, the practice of the strip searches, and \nmembership in the class.  Plaintiffs can establish membership from a ministerial inspection of the \ncomputer and paper records maintained by defendants of the arrests of protestors held on \nSeptember 27, 2002.  The other facts will not be seriously in dispute and can readily be proven. \nThe only individual questions will be questions of the amount damages and those questions can \nbe accommodated through class treatment of the claims, as discussed above. \n  23 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 24 of 25(cid:10)\n \n \nNOTICE PROPOSALS \n  FRCP Rule 23 (c)(2)(B) requires that the “[C]ourt must direct to the class members the \nbest notice practicable...”.  Plaintiffs propose that defendants provide to plaintiffs’ counsel all \npaper and electronic data in their possession, in a form useable by plaintiffs, relating to every \nclass member arrested on September 27, 2002 at the relevant protests.  This information is \nalready in the possession of the Defendants, and may already have been provided in the related \ncases.  The proposed Order filed with this motion would require defendants to provide plaintiffs’ \ncounsel with these records so that notice could be sent to the members of the class. \n  Plaintiffs further propose drafting a notice satisfying the requirements of Rule 23 and \nLCvR 23.1, subject to review by defendants, and mailing the notice to all class members.  Since \nthe class is relatively small, apparently less than 100 persons, a mailing by counsel will be \nrelatively simple.  Plaintiffs propose that the notice direct recipients to respond to plaintiffs’ \ncounsel at one of their offices.  Plaintiffs further propose that Defendants pay for the cost of \nmailing out the notice, as provided in the proposed Order. \n  In addition, plaintiffs propose to create a website for the case to provide members of the \nproposed class information about contacting plaintiffs’ counsel and to obtain information about \nthe case.  It may be possible to link this proposed website to the other websites already up which \nare providing information to members of the other classes already certified in the related cases. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Named Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification pursuant to \nRule 23(a), 23(b)(3) should be granted.  \n  24 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 18-1     Filed 02/08/2006     Page 25 of 25(cid:10)\n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n/s/ Lynn E.

See Amended\nComplaint, ¶¶ 1, 4-6, 12, 15.  John F. Clark and Steve Conboy are\neach sued only in their official capacities; Todd Dillard is sued\nonly in his individual capacity.  Id., ¶¶ 7-9.\nThe specific relief sought beyond certification of a class,\nis the award of damages and an award of attorneys’ fees and costs\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Amended Complaint at 16.  The\nofficial capacity claims (i.e. those against Defendants Clark and\nConboy) are subject to dismissal because there has been no waiver\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 4 of 29(cid:10)\nof sovereign immunity for such claims.  In any event, the claims\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 are subject to dismissal because such\nclaims apply only to actions by persons acting under color of\nstate law, and the defendants were acting under color of federal\nlaw.  Any Bivens1 claim is subject to dismissal as untimely. \nInsofar as Plaintiffs may seek to pursue Bivens claims on behalf\nof anyone who identified themselves to police as required by law,\nthey lack standing to pursue such a claim.  Finally, the Bivens\ndefendant would, at a minimum, enjoy qualified immunity for any\nclaim that he allowed strip searches of the arrestees entering\nthe Superior Court cell block who refused to identify themselves\nto police.\nARGUMENT\nSovereign immunity and limitations of Section 1983\nPlaintiffs’ official capacity claims (i.e. those against\ndefendants Clark and Conboy) are subject to dismissal because\nthere has been no waiver of sovereign immunity for a money\ndamages claim against the sovereign for a purported violation of\na Constitutional right, and an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nexplicitly applies to those persons who, while acting under color\nof the law of any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia\n1  See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau\nof Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).\n-2-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 5 of 29(cid:10)\n(collectively the “State”), violate the protected constitutional\nor federal statutory right of another.  \nPlaintiffs seek only monetary relief in this action for an\nasserted violation of a constitutional right.  See Complaint, ¶¶\n52, 58.  There has been no waiver of sovereign immunity for such\na claim.  FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 478 (1994) (a\nconstitutional tort claim is not cognizable under the FTCA);\nSettles v. U.S. Parole Commission, 429 F.3d 1098, 1106 (D.C. Cir.\n2005) (sovereign immunity bars Section 1983 claims against a\ngovernment agency); Kauffman v. Anglo-American School of Sofia,\n28 F.3d 1223 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Clark v. Library of Congress, 750\nF.2d 89, 102-104 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (sovereign immunity acts as a\nbar to a damages remedy against a federal employee in an official\ncapacity). \nIn any event, Section 1983 provides:\nEvery person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State\nor Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or\ncauses to be subjected, any citizen of the United\nStates or other person within the jurisdiction thereof\nto the deprivation of any rights, privileges or\nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall\nbe liable to the person injured in an action at law,\nsuit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress,\nexcept that in any action brought against a judicial\nofficer for an act or omission taken in such officer’s\njudicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be\ngranted unless a declaratory decree was violated or\ndeclaratory relief was unavailable.  For the purposes\nof this section, any Act of Congress applicable\nexclusively to the District of Columbia shall be\nconsidered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.\n-3-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 6 of 29(cid:10)\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (emphasis added).\nThus, § 1983 does not generally apply to federal officials\nacting under color of federal law.  See Daly-Murphy v. Winston,\n837 F.2d 348, 355 (9th Cir. 1987).  Rather, by its terms,  § 1983\napplies only to actions under color of state law and does not\nordinarily provide a basis for claims against federal officials. \nThe only possible exception occurs when there is a conspiracy\nbetween state and federal officials resulting in an abuse of\nauthority derived from state law.  Kletschka v. Driver, 411 F.2d\n436, 448 (2d Cir. 1969). \nNot only has there been no waiver of sovereign immunity, as\nmade clear in Settles, but the Federal Government and its\nofficials in their official capacities are not even “persons”\nwithin the meaning of the Section 1983.  Section 1983 permits\nsuit against a \"person\" acting under color of law of any state. \nThe United States Marshals Service is not a \"person\" for purposes\nof this statute, and therefore cannot be sued under § 1983.  See\nAl Fayad v. C.I.A., 229 F.3d 272 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (government is\nnot a \"person\" absent affirmative evidence in statute of intent\nto include sovereign government within term).  See also Hindes v.\nFDIC, 137 F.3d 148, 158 (3d Cir. 1998) (\"We find no authority to\nsupport the conclusion that a federal agency is a ‘person'\nsubject to section 1983 liability, whether or not in an alleged\nconspiracy with state actors.  We, therefore, hold that federal\n-4-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 7 of 29(cid:10)\nagencies are not ‘persons' subject to section 1983 liability.\");\nHoffman v. U.S. Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev., 519 F.2d 1160,\n1165 (5th Cir. 1975) (\"a federal agency is also excluded from the\nscope of section 1983 liability\").  When sued in their official\ncapacities, government officials are not personally liable for\ndamages; rather the damages action is equivalent to one against\nthe government itself.  See Atchinson v. District of Columbia, 73\nF.3d 418, 424 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  That plaintiffs may have named\n(or sought to name) federal employees as defendants in their\nofficial capacities does not operate to evade the immunity of the\nsovereign.  See Clark v. Library of Congress, 750 F.2d at\n102-104. \nThe legislative history clearly shows that Congress did not\nintend for Section 1983 to apply against federal actors. \nInstead, it was promulgated to provide a measure of federal\ncontrol over state officials who were either unwilling or unable\nto protect certain individuals against the deprivation of their\nconstitutional rights.  Section 1983 provided a remedy where none\nexisted.  It provided a mechanism to protect against a state\nofficial’s conduct.  \nThe named defendants in the instant action are alleged to\nhave operated as current or former officers of the United States\nMarshals Service.  See Amended Complaint, Caption and ¶¶ 1, 7-10. \n-5-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 8 of 29(cid:10)\nAs such, these officers would have acted under color of federal\nlaw, specifically under color of 28 U.S.C. §§ 561-569.2\nCongress, in describing a 1979 amendment to Section 1983\n“makes clear that Federal courts shall have jurisdiction of\nsection 1983 actions against District of Columbia officials\nacting under authority of local laws, even if those laws were\npassed by Congress.”  H.R. Rep. No. 96-548, at 2 (1979),\nreprinted in 1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2609, 2610.\nThus, the words and history of Section 1983, including the\n1979 amendment do not provide for a cause of action under Section\n1983 under the circumstances described in plaintiffs’ Amended\nComplaint.  The purpose of Section 1983 was to provide a cause of\naction where there was none.  Indeed, Congress in 1979 did just\nthat when it again provided individuals within the District of\nColumbia with a remedy for the deprivation of protected rights\nwhere there was none before.  In the instant case, plaintiffs’\nremedy, if one exists, was created by the Supreme Court in\nBivens.  Under proper circumstances, Plaintiffs may pursue a\nFourth Amendment claim under the Bivens doctrine against a\n2  It is worthy of note that the authority of United States\nMarshals and Deputy U.S. Marshals extends beyond the District of\nColumbia (or whatever district in which they primarily work), to\nany state in which they may execute the laws of the United\nStates.  28 U.S.C. § 564; United States v. Boettcher, 588 F.2d 89\n(4th Cir. 1978) (U.S. Marshal may execute arrest warrants at any\nplace within jurisdiction of the United States); United States v.\nHanna, 114 WLR 1153 (Super. Ct. 1986)(noting extraterritorial\nnature of certain Superior Court warrants).\n-6-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 9 of 29(cid:10)\nfederal employee in his or her individual capacity, but not a\nSection 1983 action.  See e.g., Berry v. Funk, 146 F.3d 1003,\n1013 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (noting that plaintiffs can bring Bivens\nactions against federal officials and section 1983 actions\nagainst state officials); McCord v. Bailey, 636 F.2d 606, 613\n(D.C. Cir. 1980) (“Actions of federal officers are outside of\n[section 1983's] proscriptions.”); Kingsley v. Bureau of Prisons,\n937 F.2d 26, 30 n. 4 (2nd Cir. 1991) (an action brought pursuant\nto Section 1983 “cannot lie against federal officials”); Heck v.\nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994) (stating that section 1983 provides\naccess to a federal forum for claims of unconstitutional\ntreatment at the hands of state officials); Community For\nCreative Non-Violence v. Unknown Agents of the United States\nMarshals Service, 791 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1992) (the United States\nMarshals Service for the Superior Court of the District of\nColumbia was acting under color of federal law when Deputy\nMarshals executed an arrest warrant issued by the D.C. Superior\nCourt).  \nThe traditional definition of acting under color of state\nlaw requires that the defendant in a § 1983 action have exercised\npower \"possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only\nbecause the alleged wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of\nstate law.”  Williams v. United States of America, 396 F.3d 412,\n414 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (emphasis added) (quoting United States v.\n-7-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 10 of 29(cid:10)\nClassic, 313 U.S. 299, 326 (1941)); West v. Adkins, 487 U.S. 42,\n49 (1988); accord Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187 (1961)\n(adopting Classic standard for purposes of § 1983) (overruled in\npart on other grounds); Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social\nServices, 436 U.S. 658, 695-701 (1978)); Polk County v. Dodson,\n454 U.S. 312, 317-18 (1981).   \nThe Williams court held that a Section 1983 action could not\nbe maintained against a special police officer employed by the\nU.S. Government Printing Office, who allegedly unlawfully\narrested appellant.  Id. at 413.  The Government Printing Office\nis a federal agency which employed the appellee as a special\npoliceman.  Id.  Federal law authorized these policemen to \nmake arrest[s] for violations of laws of the United\nStates, the several States, and the District of\nColumbia; and enforce the regulations of the Public\nPrinter, including the removal from Government printing\noffice premises of individuals who violate such\nregulations.

(citing 44 U.S.C. § 317).  Williams, was arrested by Officer\nHardwick and thereafter alleged the deprivation of his Fourth and\nFifth Amendment rights in violation of Section 1983.  The Court\nrejected Williams’ contention holding that Williams could not\nmaintain a cause of action against the officer under Section 1983\nand noting that “plaintiffs alleging abuse by federal officials\n-8-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 11 of 29(cid:10)\nare not without a remedy. . . as Williams could have brought an\naction against Hardwick under Bivens. . .”  Id., at 416.  \nTo constitute state action, “the deprivation must be caused\nby the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State .\n. . or by a person for whom the State is responsible,” and “the\nparty charged with the deprivation must be a person who may\nfairly be said to be a state actor.”  Id.  “[S]tate employment is\ngenerally sufficient to render the defendant a state actor.” \nLugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 936,  n. 18, 937\n(1982); see also Williams, supra., at 414-16.  Moreover, a\ndefendant in a § 1983 suit acts under color of state law when he\nabuses the position given to him by the State.  See Monroe v.\nPape, 365 U.S. at 172.  Thus, generally, \"a public employee acts\nunder color of state law while acting in his official capacity or\nwhile exercising his responsibilities pursuant to state law. See,\ne.g., Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535-536 (1981); Adickes v.\nS.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 152 (1970).\nThe Ninth Circuit in Tongol v. Usery, 601 F.2d 1091 (9th\nCir. 1979), discussed the “color of state law” requirement. \nTongol involved state officials who sought to recover\noverpayments of Federal Supplemental Benefits (“FSB”) under the\nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974.  Id. at 1097.  \nThe Court held that the state officials who sought to recover\nthese FSB overpayments were empowered to act only by virtue of\n-9-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 12 of 29(cid:10)\ntheir authority under state law.  Id.   The Court went on to hold\nthat “the ‘color of state law’ requirement of section 1983 has\nconsistently been treated as the same thing as the ‘state action’\nrequirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. [citations omitted].  \nId. at 1095.  Courts applying the ‘color of state law’\nrequirement have indicated that the relevant inquiry focuses not\non whose law is being implemented, but rather on whether the\nauthority of the state was exerted in enforcing the law.\n[citations omitted].”  Id. at 1097.  \nThe Third Circuit has held that “there [i]s no set formula\nfor determining whether the employees of an agency with both\nstate and federal characteristics must be examined to consider\nwhether the acts complained of were sufficiently linked to the\nstate.”  Johnson v. Orr, 780 F.2d 386, 390 (3rd Cir. 1986).  “A\ncrucial inquiry is ‘whether day-to-day operations are supervised\nby the Federal [or state] government.’” United States v. Orleans,\n425 U.S. 807, 815 (1976).  \nIn Case v. Milewski, 327 F. 3d 564, 567 (7th Cir. 2003), the\ncourt recognized two circumstances in which a party may be found\nto act under color of state law.  The first is when the states\nhave cloaked the defendants in some degree of authority, normally\nthrough employment or some other agency relationship.  Id. at\n567; see Yang v. Hardin, 37, F.3d 282, 284 (7th Cir.\n1994)(finding that Chicago police officers were acting under\n-10-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 13 of 29(cid:10)\ncolor of state law when “[t]hey were on duty, wearing Chicago\npolice uniforms, driving a marked squad car and were\ninvestigating a crime.”); Pickrel v. City of Springfield,\nIllinois, 45 F.3d 1115, 1118 (7th Cir. 1995) (finding an off-duty\nSpringfield, Illinois police officer could have been acting under\ncolor of state law because he was wearing his police uniform and\ndisplaying his badge.)\nThe second circumstance is when the defendants have\nconspired or acted in concert with state officials to deprive a\nperson of his civil rights.  In order to establish a conspiracy,\nthe party must demonstrate that the state officials and the\nprivate party somehow reached an understanding to deny a party of\nhis constitutional rights.  Case, 327 F.3d 564, 567 [citations\nomitted].  The court further acknowledged that “although an\naction brought pursuant to § 1983 cannot lie against federal\nofficers acting under color of federal law, it is assumed that a\n§ 1983 action can lie against federal employees . . . as it can\nagainst private individuals . . . if they conspire or act in\nconcert with state officials to deprive a person of her civil\nrights under color of state law.” (emphasis added).  \nWhen distinguishing between federal and state actors, “[a]\ncrucial inquiry is ‘whether day-to-day operations are supervised\nby the Federal [or state] government.’” Johnson v. Orr, 780 F.2d\n386, 390 (3rd Cir. 1986).  The Deputy Marshals are supervised and\n-11-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 14 of 29(cid:10)\ncontrolled by the U.S. Marshals Service not the District of\nColumbia.  Even the D.C. Statute acknowledging that the Marshals\nService “serves the courts of the District of Columbia,” also\nconfirms that such service is “subject to the supervision of the\nAttorney General of the United States.” D.C. Code § 11-1729.   \nIndeed, the Plaintiffs admit that “[i]ndividual defendants were\nfollowing USMS and USMDC policy, customs, and practices. . . and \n[a]t all relevant times individual defendants were acting within\nthe scope of their employment, their acts were motivated by a\ndesire to further the interests of the USMS and USMDC.”  Amended\nComplaint, ¶¶ 44-45.3  Accordingly, Counts Two, Three and Four\nshould be dismissed.\nAny Bivens Claim Is Untimely.\nDefendants submit that the one-year statute of limitations\ngoverns Plaintiffs’ Bivens claims.\nWhen a federal action contains no statute of\nlimitations, courts will ordinarily look to analogous\n3  Although the plaintiffs also aver that they were\nproceeding “under color of District of Columbia law,” Amended\nComplaint, ¶ 46, the Court need not accept legal conclusions cast\nin the form of factual allegations.  Lowal v. MCI Communications\nCorp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  Where the Court need\nonly take judicial notice of the statutes providing the authority\nfor the U.S. Marshals to act, it is clear that there exists no\nfactual dispute on the issue.  Similarly, because the Plaintiffs\nthemselves admit that the acts of which they complain only\noccurred after the D.C. police relinquished custody of the\nplaintiffs to federal authorities and pursuant to the Federal\npolicies, see Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 44, 46, there is no basis for\ntheir claim that they acted as agents of the District of\nColumbia.\n-12-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 15 of 29(cid:10)\nprovisions in state law as a source of a federal\nlimitations period.  See, e.g., Burnett v. Grattan, 468\nU.S. ----, 104 S.Ct. 2924, 2929, 82 L.Ed.2d 36 (1984); \nJohnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454,\n464, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1722, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975);   \nBrown v. United States, 742 F.2d 1498, 1503 (D.C. Cir.\n1984) (en banc).  Concluding that \"damage to reputation\n... is central to the [plaintiff's] claim,\" Opinion at\n2, the district court applied the District of\nColumbia's one year statute of limitations governing\ndefamation actions to Doe's Bivens suit.  See D.C. Code\n§ 12-301(4).  The D.C. statute of limitations reads, in\nrelevant part: Except as otherwise specifically\nprovided by law, actions for the following  purposes\nmay not be brought after the expiration of the period\nspecified below from the time the right to maintain the\naction accrues:. . .(4) for libel, slander, assault,\nbattery, mayhem, wounding, malicious prosecution, false\narrest or false imprisonment -- 1 year; . . .(8) for\nwhich a limitation is not otherwise specially\nprescribed--3 years.  D.C. Code § 12-301.  We agree\nwith the district court that the one year limitations\nperiod should be applied.\nDoe v. United States Department of Justice, 753 F.2d 1092, 1114 &\nn.28 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (footnote inserted into text).  Here, the\nallegedly unlawful action took place in September 2002.  See\nAmended Complaint, ¶¶ 11-12.  The original complaint was not\nfiled until 2005, well beyond the one-year limitations period.4 \n4  Defendants recognize that the Supreme Court has reached a\ndifferent conclusion in addressing Section 1983 actions.  See\nWilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 271-72 (1985) (applying statutory\nconstruction principles to Section 1983 and concluding that the\npersonal injury limitations period would presumably apply).  A\nBivens action, however, is not created by statute; and\nplaintiffs’ claims are most like those described in D.C. Code §\n12-301(4). See Banks v. Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co., \n802 F.2d 1416, 1429,  (D.C. Cir. 1986) (citing McClam, 697 F.2d\nat 372-74).  Courts in other jurisdictions have, in defendants’\nview, incorrectly assumed that the statutory analysis applied in\nWilson should also be applied in the Bivens context.  See e.g.,\nHarris v. United States,  422 F.3d 322, 331 (6th Cir. 2005).  To\n-13-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 16 of 29(cid:10)\nSee McClam v. Barry, 697 F.2d 366, 372-74 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (false\narrest claim most closely analogous to a claim under D.C. Code §\n12-301(4)).  Thus, Count One is subject to dismissal as untimely.\nPlaintiffs Lack Standing to Pursue Claims\nof Those Who Identified Themselves to Police.\nThe named plaintiffs, Paul Bame, Gregory Keltner and Ivan\nWelander, allege that they were among those arrested, yet their\nnames do not appear on the Lock Up lists which they have attached\nto Plaintiff’s Motion For Class Certification.  Thus, if as the\nindividual plaintiffs allege, they were arrested during the IMF\ndemonstrations and remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals\nService, then each of them must be listed on the Lock Up lists as\n“John Doe.”  Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 1 (attached to Plaintiffs’\nMotion For Class Certification).5  This significant detail\nregarding the individual plaintiffs makes them unlike any of the\nmen whom they seek to represent who properly identified\ndefendants’ knowledge this Circuit has not accepted this\ninvitation to treat Bivens claims as if they are subject to the\nstatutory analysis applied in Wilson.  Bivens claims are uniquely\ncreatures of Federal common law, and as such they cannot and\nshould not be treated uniformly, as contemplated in Wilson. \nInstead, local law has elected to separate common law claims as\nsubject to differing limitations periods, depending on the nature\nof the claim.  This practice should continue to be followed\nunless and until the District of Columbia adopts a separate\nlimitations period for Bivens claims.  See Banks v. Chesapeake\nand Potomac Telephone Co., 802 F.2d at 1429.\n5  The Lock Up Lists contain the names of 54 men identified\nonly as John Doe, but no Paul Bame, Gregory Keltner or Ivan\nWelander.\n-14-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 17 of 29(cid:10)\nthemselves when arrested, as required by District of Columbia\nlaw.  See D.C. Code § 50-2303.07 (formerly D.C. Code § 40-627);\nsee also Barnett v. United States, 525 A.2d 197, 199 and n.6\n(D.C. 1987) (A pedestrian who refuses to provide his or her name\nand address to a police officer upon request after having been\nstopped for committing an infraction shall, upon conviction, be\nfined; and violations shall continue to be prosecuted as criminal\noffenses).\nThe Supreme Court has disfavored across-the-board class\nactions as a typical mechanism to pursue civil rights actions. \nSee General Telephone Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147 (1982); East\nTexas Motor Freight Systems, Inc. v. Rodriques, 431 U.S. 395\n(1977).  These cases firmly establish that the \"class\nrepresentative [must] be part of the class and possess the same\ninterest and suffer the same injury as the class members.\" \nFalcon, 457 U.S. at 156 (emphasis added); Rodriques, 431 U.S. at\n403 (emphasis added).  Here, the individual plaintiffs do not\npossess the same interests as those of the arrestees who lawfully\nidentified themselves to the proper authorities upon being\narrested.  Instead, they possess only a lesser interest to be\nfree from more intrusive searches upon arrest, because one may\nlogically infer that someone who is refusing to abide by a law\nrequiring them to identify themselves to police reasonably may be\nattempting to hide something.  Under those circumstances, the\n-15-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 18 of 29(cid:10)\nplaintiffs are less likely to diligently pursue claims other than\nthose which would benefit the “John Doe” arrestees.  In this\nrespect, the individual plaintiffs fail to satisfy the\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); and they lack standing to\npursue claims on behalf of the arrestees who provided their\nnames.  See Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991 (1982) (class\nrepresentatives who had been transferred to lower levels of\nmedical care lacked standing to challenge transfers to higher\nlevels of care); Defendants’ April 3, 2006 Opposition To Motion\nFor Class Certification at 19-23; see also Thomas v. Albright,\n139 F.3d 227, 236 (D.C. Cir. 1998). (The purpose of the\nrequirement that representative parties are typical of the claims\nor defenses of the class is to ensure \"that the class\nrepresentatives have suffered injuries in the same general\nfashion as absent class members.\").  Thus, the Court should\ndismiss all claims other than those brought by arrestees who were\nidentified only as “John Does.”\nDefendant Dillard has, at a minimum, qualified immunity\nfor any claim that he allowed strip searches of the IMF\narrestees entering the Superior Court cell block who\nrefused to identify themselves as required by law.     \nQualified immunity protects government officials \"from\nliability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v.\n-16-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 19 of 29(cid:10)\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  It is well settled that\ngovernment officials such as the individual defendants in this\ncase enjoy a qualified immunity from constitutional and statutory\nclaims against them.  See, Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200-01\n(2001); Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987);\nCleavinger v. Saxner, 474 U.S. 193, 206 (1985); Mitchell v.\nForsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n800, 818 (1982).  The qualified immunity analysis was explained\nin Harlow: \ngovernment officials performing discretionary functions\ngenerally are shielded from liability for civil damages\ninsofar as their conduct does not violate \"clearly\nestablished\" statutory or constitutional rights of\nwhich a reasonable person would have known. \n457 U.S. at 818.  And, a defendant's subjective good faith is not\nrelevant to the qualified immunity analysis, id. at 815-18;\nrather in making this assessment, the Supreme Court said a right\nis clearly established when \"it would be clear to a reasonable\nofficer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he\nconfronted.\" Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.  Conversely, an official\nis not shielded from liability where he \"could be expected to\nknow that certain conduct would violate statutory or\nconstitutional rights.\" See Farmer v. Moritsugu, 163 F.3d 610,\n613 (D.C. Cir. 1998); accord Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226,\n231-32 (1991) (A necessary concomitant to the determination of\nwhether the constitutional right asserted by a plaintiff is\n-17-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 20 of 29(cid:10)\n\"clearly established\" at the time the defendant acted is the\ndetermination of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation\nof a constitutional right at all); see also Fernandors v.\nDistrict of Columbia  382 F.Supp.2d 63, 70-71 (D.D.C. 2005); see\nalso Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999)(a court performing\na qualified immunity inquiry must first determine whether the\nplaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional\nright.).\nThe whole purpose of qualified immunity is to protect public\nofficials \"from the costs associated with the defense of damages\nactions\" by rooting out meritless lawsuits at the earliest point\npossible in the litigation process.  Crawford-El v. Britton, 523\nU.S. 574, 590 (1998).  As the Supreme Court explained in Davis v.\nScherer, 468 U.S. 183, 197 (1984), \"[a] plaintiff who seeks\ndamages for violation of constitutional or statutory rights may\novercome the defendant official's qualified immunity only by\nshowing that those rights were clearly established at the time of\nthe conduct at issue.\"  Moreover, \"[e]ven defendants who violate\nconstitutional rights enjoy a qualified immunity that protects\nthem from liability for damages unless it is further demonstrated\nthat their conduct was unreasonable under the applicable\nstandard.\"  Id. at 190.\nThus, in developing the doctrine of qualified immunity, the\nSupreme Court has sought to strike a balance \"between the\ninterests in vindication of citizens' constitutional rights and\n-18-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 21 of 29(cid:10)\nin public officials' effective performance of their duties.\"\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639 (1987) (quotation\nomitted).  Recognizing that \"bare allegations of malice should\nnot suffice to subject government officials either to the costs\nof trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery,\" Harlow,\n457 U.S. at 817-18, the Court balanced those competing interests\nby establishing a higher threshold for holding public officials\npersonally liable for constitutional violations.  For a public\nofficial to be liable for damages, that official must have\nviolated a constitutional right, and that right must have been\n\"clearly established\" -- \"[t]he contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand\nwhat he is doing violates that right.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640.\n(\"qualified immunity protects ‘all but the plainly incompetent or\nthose who knowingly violate the law'\") (quoting Malley v. Briggs,\n475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986)).\nNumerous circuits have placed the burden on plaintiff to\ncome forward with evidence sufficient to create genuine issue as\nto whether defendant's conduct was objectively reasonable in\nlight of clearly established law.  See, e.g., Salas v. Carpenter,\n980 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. 1992); Washington v. Newsom, 977 F.2d 991\n(6th Cir. 1992); Stewart v. Baldwin County Bd. of Educ., 908 F.2d\n1499 (11th Cir. 1990); Hannon v. Turnage, 892 F.2d 653 (7th Cir.\n1990); Pleasant v. Lovell, 876 F.2d 787 (10th Cir. 1989).  And a\n-19-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 22 of 29(cid:10)\ncourt performing a qualified immunity inquiry \"must first\ndetermine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an\nactual constitutional right.\"  Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. at 609.  \nThe Supreme Court has instructed that deciding whether a\nconstitutional right was violated first, rather than asking\nwhether the right was clearly established, \"promotes clarity in\nthe legal standards for official conduct, to the benefit of both\nthe officers and the general public.\"  Id.  The validity of the\nqualified immunity analysis \"depends substantially upon the level\nof generality at which the relevant ‘legal rule’ is to be\nidentified.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639.  At the first stage of\nthe inquiry, \"courts must not define the relevant constitutional\nright in overly general terms, lest they strip the qualified\nimmunity defense of all meaning.\"  Butera v. District of\nColumbia, 235 F.3d 637, 646 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Thus, while one\nmust concede that citizens enjoy a constitutional right to be\nfree from unreasonable searches, it is equally clear that once a\nperson is arrested, they are subject to search incident to that\narrest.  Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 763 (1969), and\nstrip searches based on less than probable cause do not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment; rather “the Fourth Amendment prohibits only\nunreasonable searches, and under the circumstances, we do not\nbelieve that these searches are unreasonable.”  Bell v. Wolfish \n-20-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 23 of 29(cid:10)\n441 U.S. 520, 558 (1979) (citing Carroll v. United States, 267\nU.S. 132, 147 (1925)).\nAdmittedly, courts have required more than a whim to support\nsuch a search, but under the circumstances presented by the\nindividual plaintiffs, like all of the “John Doe” IMF arrestees\non September 27, 2002, it cannot be said that no reasonable law\nenforcement officer could have believed that the searches were\nproper.  The circumstances included announced efforts by protest\ngroups to close Washington, DC.  See The People’s Strike: A Day\nof Non-Compliance and Resistance, (Exhibit A) (available at\nhttp:www.abolishthebank.org/strike_archive.shtml) (last accessed\nApril 19, 2006) (“. . . in the city hailed as the capital of the\nfree world we call for a People’s Strike to shut down this\nmachine and take back our freedom on September 27, 2002!. . .\nPeople are getting organized and making plans to shut the city\ndown for a day and effectively stop business as usual”).  At this\nsame time, hundreds of protesters were being arrested in the city\nand many, like the plaintiffs, refused to properly identify\nthemselves, as required by District of Columbia law, leaving law\nenforcement in the dark regarding whether their histories include\nnumerous weapons or drug offenses.  See Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 1,\n11-12; Lock Up Lists (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1 to Motion For Class\nCertification).  The Marshals would not have been able to\n-21-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 24 of 29(cid:10)\nidentify these individuals other than as “John Does,” leaving it\na complete mystery what their actual criminal histories or drug\nhistories were.6  \nAt the time of the alleged strip searches in this case, the\nlaw was not clearly established and remains unclear today,\nwhether one refusing a lawful request to identify himself can be\npresumed to be hiding something about himself, and whether that\nreasonably could be interpreted as a penchant to hide weapons,\ndrugs or any form of contraband.  Indeed, as to those lawfully\nconfined, a specific basis for concern about contraband could\nreasonably support strip searches, even absent a basis for\nindividualized suspicion.  See, N.G. And S.G. v. State of\nConnecticut, 382 F.3d 225, 232 (2d Cir. 2004).  And here, reports\nindicate a penchant for those being processed through the\n6  Public records, for instance, would appear to identify\nPlaintiff Paul Bame as having posted on the worldwide web a\nrecipe for producing an explosive “black powder”, see\nhttp://www.florilegium.org/files/COMBAT/blackpowder-msg.text,\nand Plaintiff Ivan Welander, as carrying a knife.  See \nhttp://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/2003/03/28/9354\n72.php (accessed April 19, 2006); and a “twenty-three-year-old\nGreg Keltner, drug-dealer, wannabe musician. . .” \nhttp://theband.hiof.no/books/mfbp_book_john_niven.html (accessed\nApril 19, 2006) (Exhibit B).  Defendants do not intend to imply\nthat these types of facts are required before one can establish a\nproper showing to warrant a strip search, but these are\nillustrative of the things that one may seek to hide from the\nauthorities by refusing to identify oneself to law enforcement in\nthe face of a statute requiring such identification.  This is why\na reasonable law enforcement officer might infer that an arrestee\nwho refuses to provide identifying information may be presumed to\nbe hiding something of significance.  \n-22-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 30-1     Filed 04/19/2006     Page 25 of 29(cid:10)\nSuperior Court Cell Block to secret contraband.  See Defendants’\nNotices of Filing dated April 5, 2006 and April 17, 2006. \nThe Supreme Court had concluded long ago that in the prison\ncontext, such searches do not necessarily violate the Fourth\nAmendment. Bell v. Wolfish  441 U.S. at 558.  Although on-the-\nstreet strip searches have more recently been looked on with\ndisfavor, see Fernandors v.

Plaintiffs\nrespond here to the issues raised in defendants’ opposition in the sequence of\ndefendants’ presentation.  In short, plaintiffs contend that defendants have offered\nno persuasive reasons for denying class certification in this case.\nNo Double Recovery by Plaintiffs.\nDefendants note that several lawsuits arose out of the protest events on\nSeptember 27, 2002 and then contend that plaintiffs are trying to obtain a double\n1\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 2 of 23(cid:10)\nrecovery, once against District of Columbia defendants in other litigation and\nagain from the USMS defendants in this case, since Paul Bame and other class\nmembers are pursuing damages for the “same conduct” against D.C. defendants in\nthe Burgin/Diamond v D.C. case, C.A. No. 03-0205 (EGS).  Pp. 3-8 (Page\nnumbers following restatement of defendants’ contentions refer to pages in their\nMemorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification).\nPlaintiffs’ response is that in fact this case is distinct from the Diamond case\nbecause is seeks relief for different misconduct and against different defendants.\nThat action lies solely against the District government and officials and no federal\ndefendants are named nor is relief is sought against federal defendants.  Hence,\nBame and the other class members will  not be awarded damages from the federal\ndefendants in the Diamond case.  The Diamond claim are for detention per se, and\nfalse arrest, but not for the illegal searches entailed in the strip searching. \nMoreover, the Diamond claims are for detention per se, and false arrest, but not\nfor the illegal searches entailed in the strip searching. The Diamond compplaint\ndoes not allege illegal strip searching by MPD or persons under its control.  In\naddition, the Bame plaintiffs in this case are not seeking damages for the strip\nsearches against D.C. defendants.  The Bame plaintiffs will recover damages in\nDiamond only for the Diamond claims, but not for any relief parallel to this case.  \n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 3 of 23(cid:10)\nThe Barham case was filed solely on behalf of a class of persons arrested in\nPershing Park, as well as a few individual plaintiffs.1 The Bame class members are\nsimply are not part of that class,2 and hence no recovery whatsoever is requested in\nBarham for the proposed class members in Bame.  \nPaul Bame Not a Named Plaintiff in Diamond\nDefendants suggest that Paul Bame himself and perhaps others could have\npursued damages for his strip search claim in the Burgin/Diamond case, since, as\nthey allege, he is a “named plaintiff” in that case. P. 4. \nWhile Mr. Bame has agreed to affiliate himself publicly with that case, no\nfilings in that case show him as a named plaintiff therein, and he exerts no control\nover that case.  Moreover, he was not a named plaintiff at the origin of the case,\nand did not have play a role in the crafting of the claims filed therein.\nPlaintiffs’ Sufficiently Pled Violations of the Fourth Amendment to Support\nClass Certification.\nDefendants contend that the strip searches complained of herein simply do\n1  Barham complaint paragraph 140. Ex. 9. \n2  The class certification order in Barham grants class status only to persons\narrested in Pershing Park. \n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 4 of 23(cid:10)\nnot violate the Fourth Amendment, because there existed sufficient bases to\nundertake the strip searches under the USMS written policy. P. 12 and Ex. B.\nIn response, plaintiffs suggest that, thus, defendants are seemingly\nattempting, in response to a motion for class certification, to move for summary\njudgment to defeat the main claims.  Plaintiffs’ need only show at this stage that\nthey have adequately pled facts in their complaint to support the Fourth\nAmendment claims. See, e.g., Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177, 40\nL. Ed. 2d 732, 94 S. Ct. 2140 (1974).; Mack et al. v. Suffolk Co., et al., 191 F.R.D.\n16, 20(D. Mass. 2000). The issue of the existence of an unconstitutional strip\nsearch policy is a important factual element of plaintiffs’ case.  The issue must\nawait determination at the summary judgement stage following adequate\ndiscovery, or following trial, not in this stage where the parties are asking the\nCourt to adjudicate a motion for class certification. \nSecond, the USMS written policy statement, Ex. B, nowhere authorizes strip\nsearches of batches of prisoners in the absence of reasonable, individualized\nsuspicion for each arrestee searched. The policy statement does not show that\nthese particular strip searches conformed to Fourth Amendment standards.\n Moreover, instead of offering evidence to show that the defendants were in\npossession of individualized reasonable suspicions as bases for conducting each of\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 5 of 23(cid:10)\nthe strip searches on these class members on that day, defendants present a lengthy\ndescription of some aspects of the procedures for the handling of prisoners and\narrestees by the MPD and the USMS deputies in D.C. Superior Court.  However,\ndefendants offer no evidence in their brief to support their bald factual contentions\nthat there were reasonable bases for each of the searches complained of here. \nDefendants thus provide the court with no basis for making a factual finding that\nthere existed some bases for suspicions upon which to ground some searches. \nThese factual matters must await development through discovery and are not\nappropriate for determination at this stage. \nDefendants fail to offer any records concerning the searches conducted by\ndeputy marshals of protest arrestees on September 28, 2002.  Thus, as noted in\nplaintiffs’ main brief on this motion, a reasonable inference is that defendants in\nfact have no records of these searches, and hence no documentation which will\nserve as a basis for their arguing that the searches were reasonable.  Instead,\ndefendants offer the Court Exhibit A, which appears to be simply a collection of\nreports of the results of searches of arrrestees and prisoners conducted in entirely\nother situations over a roughly ten year period.  Significantly, this collection of\nreports does not contain any report from any searches conducted on September 28,\n2002 of plaintiff class members or of any one else.  Apparently, under USMS\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 6 of 23(cid:10)\nguidelines reports are prepared only when contraband is found during a search.  A\nreasonable inference is that the searches of plaintiffs class members turned up no\ncontraband. \nArrestees’ Provision of Their Names Is Irrelevant.\nDefendants contend that the apparent failure of some arrestees to provide\ntheir names and to identify themselves at various stages of the detention process in\nitself gave rise to a reasonable basis for strip searching them.  Pp. 12.\nDefendants’ position is pure speculation on what might be the facts of the\ncase, without reliance on any form of admissible evidence.  There is no admissible\nevidence currently in the record that the deputies conducting the searches knew\nwhether or not an individual prisoner had identified himself to a police official.\nMoreover, the defendants offer no admissible evidence that class members who\ndid identify themselves were not strip searched.  In addition, the fact that certain\narrestees are identified as “John Does” in the lock-up lists, does not prove that at\nleast some of them later did not identify themselves to the detaining officers.  Paul\nBame in fact identified himself to the court in order to secure his release and left\nthe Superior Court with a Notice to Return to court at a later time.  Ex. 6.\n(Declaration of Paul Bame.)\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 7 of 23(cid:10)\nThe Court need not countenance such speculation at this stage of the\nproceedings, but should await the factual development of the case, assuming this\nissue has any relevance.\nPlaintiffs Amended Complaint properly pleads the core claim of the case\nthat a blanket3 strip search was conducted on all the men in the proposed class on\nthat day, with no individualized suspicion upon which to base a search.  The Court\nneed not delve more deeply into the facts of the situation at this stage.\nArrival of Arrestees from the MPD Central Cell Block Does not Provide a\nBasis for Blanket Strip Searching All Arrestees.\nDefendants contend that the practices of bringing arrestees from the central\nMPD cell block necessitated blanket strip searches of all arrestees.  P. 14.\nThere is no evidence in the record of where the class members were brought\nfrom by the MPD officials.   They may have come from the Blue Plains holding\nfacility.  They may have come from facilities in Virginia. Ex. 7 (Declaration of\nPlaintiff Ivan Welander).  Defendants provide no evidence at this stage that arrival\nof an arrestee from a particular venue provides a basis for strip searching them.\n3 The term “blanket strip searches” as used here are those searches conducted\nwithout a reasonable, individualized suspicion upon which to base the conduct of a search,\nparticularly a search as personally intrusive as a strip search.\n7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 8 of 23(cid:10)\nThere is no evidence in the record that the deputies who conducted the strip\nsearches knew where each class member was brought from, and, hence, there is no\nbasis at this time in the record for adjudicating the validity of a strip search on that\npurported ground. \nUSMS Policy Statement Does Not Support the Searches Complained of\nHerein\nDefendants contend that the USMS policy statement submitted as their\nExhibit B shows that the strip searches could have had a reasonable basis. \nTo the contrary, the policy statement is merely a statement of general\nguidelines for searches by deputies.  Defendants have not produced evidence that\nit was applied by the deputies on the relevant day. \nThe policy statement fails to account for the standards for searches of\narrestees set forth in the consent decree entered in Morgan v. Barry, Ex. 11, later\ndiscussed at 596 F. Supp. 897 (D.D.C. 1984), more than 20 years prior to\nSeptember 28, 2002..  This decree forbids the blanket strip searches of arrestees,\nof the type complained of herein.  While the Morgan decree by its own terms\napplies to women, the standards would be read to apply to similar categories of\nmale arrestees.\n8\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 9 of 23(cid:10)\nThe defendants’ policy statement does assist the Court and parties by\nproviding a graphic and detailed description of the strip search procedures.\nThe Court Need Not Conduct Individualized Hearings to Determine Class\nMembership.\nDefendants contend that the court would have to determine for each class\nmember whether there were a reasonable suspicion upon which to conduct a strip\nsearch of each of the class members. “Each search would have to be reviewed by\ncourt to determine the reasonableness of the suspicion upon which the search was\nbased.”  P. 16  Defendants rely on their Ex B as authorizing USMS cellblock\npersonnel to conduct strip searches whenever they suspect that the detainee may\nbe in possession of contraband. P. 16. \nTo the contrary, the plaintiffs’ core claim is that a blanket strip search of all\nthe arrestees occurred on that day without any individualized reasonable basis for\nsuch a search. The Court will not need to conduct individual hearings to determine\nwhether there was an individualized, reasonable basis for each of the searches,\nsince the claim is that this was a blanket series of strip searches.   \nIn fact, as noted, the lack of USMS reports of any kind, much less any\nfinding of contraband found on class members negates defendants’ suggestion that\n9\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 10 of 23(cid:10)\nthe Court would have to conduct an inquiry as to the reasonableness of each\nsearch. Paradoxically, the apparent USMS lack of finding any contraband is\ncorroboration that there was no basis for any of the searches.  In fact, defendants\nnowhere articulate any basis for any of the strip search, other than that some class\nmembers failed to give their names and that they were arriving from the custody of\nthe MPD officials. \nThe Class Has Numerosity. \nDefendants challenge the numerosity of the class, based on their perceived\nissues with the lock up lists submitted by plaintiffs. P. 17.  \nThe lock up lists show 92 persons with male men who are likely in the class. \nPl Ex. 1.  Moreover, Paul Bame states in his declaration, attached hereto as Exhibit\n6, that he “observed 70 to 80 men” with him in various adjacent cells during\nprocessing who had been strip searched and arrested at protests on September 27,\n2002 outside of Pershing Park.   Ivan Welander states in his declaration, attached\nhereto as Exhibit 7, that he observed at least 50 men in the cell areas while he was\nbeing processed, who had been strip searched and arrested at protests on\nSeptember 27, 2002 outside of Pershing Park.  These declarations by eyewitnesses\non the scene of the detention and strip searches provide the Court with ample\n10\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 11 of 23(cid:10)\nfactual basis for a finding numerosity of the class in this case. \nIn addition, the men in the Diamond classes, which overlap with the\nproposed class herein, number several hundred.\nDefendants also claim that plaintiffs admit that any class under 40 persons\ncannot be certified. \nIn fact, Judge Lamberth points out in Neal v. Moore, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n21339, [24] (D.D.C. 1994), that there is no numerical floor on class size.  The\nCourt may easily find numerosity present with the proposed class of about 80 men\nunder the current state of the record.  \nNamed Plaintiffs Are Adequate Representatives of the Class.\nDefendants contend that the named plaintiffs are not adequate\nrepresentatives of the entire class, since they refused to give their names while\nother class members did give their names.   Defendants base their assertion on the\nabsence in the Lock-Up lists of the names of the named plaintiffs.  At best,\ndefendants contend, the named plaintiffs could only represent those class members\nwho refused to give their names.  P.17\nIn response, the Court may note that the Lock-Up list shows only those\npersons who refused to provide their names at the time those lists were prepared.\n11\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 12 of 23(cid:10)\nThere is no way of knowing carefully the officers preparing the lists polled each\nperson in the group. These lists are not evidence that the class members continued\nto refuse to provide their names or identities at later stages of arrest processing to\ndetaining officers.  Moreover, the MPD officials implemented a procedure to take\nfingerprints and photographs of the arresteess, according to the declarations of\nPaul Bame, Ex. 6 and Ivan Welander. Ex. 7.  Thus, the arrestees did provide their\nidentity during the processing of their cases.  \nMoreover, Paul Bame did in fact provide his name to his defense attorney at\narraignment, who in turn provided it to the Court.  His statement of his identity, he\nunderstood, was sufficient to secure his release.  Ex. 6.  Ivan Welander was\nreleased without even undergoing arraignment since he understood that the\ndetaining officials had lost his papers. Ex. 7. He did also provide his name to a\ndefense attorney.  Welander and some of his fellow class members could hardly be\nlabeled security risks during their detainment if the detaining officials could not\nbother themselves to keep track of him and several other arrestees with him.  Thus,\nthe defendants were in possession of sufficient information to identify him and the\nother arrestees, if they had considered any of the many protest arrestees to present\nany form of security risk. \n12\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 13 of 23(cid:10)\nThe Class Has Commonality\nDefendants contend that the proposed class lacks commonality, since each\nstrip each class member presents facts rooted in the particular circumstances of\ntheir individual strip search. P. 19.  \nTo the contrary, defendants also defend the strip searches on the basis of\nhaving to follow the USMS policy statement, Ex. B., as if to say that there were a\npolicy being followed by the deputies at least on that day.  At a minimum there is\nsufficient commonality among class members on the issue of whether the \npurported policy was being followed by the deputies and whether it met\nconstitutional standards.  To determine commonality, the Court need not find that\nall class member presents the identical set of issues, but rather whether the class\nmembers share a sufficient number of issues in common to justify class treatment. \nBynum, et al. v. D.C., 217 F.R.D. 27, 33 (D.D.C. 2003); Neal, et al. v. Moore, et\nal., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21339 [26] (D.D.C. 1994); and other cases cited in\nplaintiffs’ main brief.   Here there is sufficient commonality of shared issues\namong class members to warrant class treatment.\nPerhaps more significantly, the class members were searched in batches,\naccording to the Bame and Welander declarations.  Exx. 6 and 7.   Defendants\noffer no evidence in their brief to support a finding that the deputies were\n13\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 14 of 23(cid:10)\nfollowing a procedure that entailed use of reasonable, individualized suspicion  of\neach class member prior to his being searched.  Thus, no evidence brought forth\nby defendants so far would enable the Court to find an individualized reasonable\nbasis for conducting any search on any class member.  As noted, the deputies\napparently maintained no records of the bases of the searches or of the results of\nthe searches themselves, although defendants came forward with what may be a\ncomplete record of all other searches conducted over a multi-year period by deputy\nmarshals in Superior Court at times other than September 28, 2002.\nOther court which have considered defendants’ contention have rejected it. \nSee, e.g., Bynum, supra; Helton v U.S.,191 F. Supp. 2d 179 (D.D.C. 2002); Mack\nv. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 24 (D. Mass. 2000). \n \nThe Named Plaintiffs Have Claims Typical of the Whole Class.\nDefendants contend that the representative plaintiffs lack typicality of the\nclaims of the other members of the class, since named plaintiffs failed to give their\nnames to the MPD officials at one point in the detention process, allegedly in\nviolation of a local D.C. statute.  Moreover, defendants contend that an arrestees’\nfailure to give his or her name allows an arresting officer to be “advised that the\nperson is concealing contraband” under terms of the the USMS policy paper.\n14\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 15 of 23(cid:10)\nFootnote 10. \nAs stated, Paul Bame did identify himself at one point in the proceedings to\nhis attorney and through the attorney to the court judge hearing the arraignments.\nEx. 6  Welander also identified himself to his attorney for the same purpose. Ex. 7\nMoreover, the detaining officers apparently photographed and fingerprinted every\narrestee in the class.  Exx. 6 and 7.  Thus, the named plaintiffs in fact are typical of\nboth subsets of class members, if these in fact be true subsets.  \nMoreover, plaintiffs contend that the failure of certain arrestees to provide\ntheir names at one stage of the arraignment process is irrelevant to the class issue.  \nThe Morgan consent decree, Ex. 11, does not permit arrestees who fail to provide\ntheir names to be strip searched.  \nMoreover, the USMS policy statement, Ex B, does not appear to permit the\nextreme measure of strip searches based on a failure of protestors arrested for\nminor infractions to give their names.\nIndividual Findings of Fact Are Not Required for the Court to Award\nDamages.\nDefendants contend that the claims alleged will require the Court to take\nproof as to each class member’s individual mental and emotional state, and, thus,\n15\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 16 of 23(cid:10)\nthe commonality requirement is not met for the class. P. 22\nPlaintiffs’ claim are not an aggregation of a series of similar tort claims.  All\nthe plaintiffs share the same claim for the Fourth Amendment violations\ncommitted by the defendants, as stated in the Amended Complaint.  Plaintiffs have\nalready presented in their main class certification brief their position that the\nliability could be determined on a class basis, since there are facts common to all\nthe claimants.  Moreover, the amount of damages can be tried in the sample trials\nas proposed in the main class certification brief.  See, Plaintiffs’ Main Brief pp. 21\nff.  Defendants simply do not respond to this proposed use of a now familiar\napproach for adjudicating the amount of damages for each class member.  Courts\nhave many times held that a class may be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) when there\nare individual amounts of damages, again, as discussed in the plaintiffs’ main\nbrief. Moreover, in this case, plaintiff class members might possibly be held all to\nhave suffered the same damages for a constitutional law violation, and awarded\nthe same amount.\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel Have No Conflict of Interest.\nDefendants raise the possibility, without actually contending, that plaintiffs’\nlead counsel, Mr. Cunningham, might at some point have a conflict of interest\n16\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 17 of 23(cid:10)\nunder D.C. Code of Professional Responsibility Rule 1.9. Pp. 26-27. They suggest\nthat since Mr. Cunningham formerly was one of the counsel for plaintiffs in\nJohnson v. D.C., he might be faced with taking a position in this case which\nadversely affects the interests of the plaintiff class in Johnson.   Defendants’\nsuggestion presumably arises since one of the two sets of claims raised in Johnson\nis that female arrestees were discriminated against under the Equal Protection\naspect of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,4 in that certain\ncategories of female arrestees were as a matter of USMS policy subjected to strip\nsearches while similarly situated male arrestees were not.  Since the proposed\nBame class is by definition all male, so defendants’ argument presumably goes,\ncounsel’s pursuit of the men’s interests might adversely affect the Johnson\nwomen’s interests.\nIn short, plaintiffs’ counsel does not have a conflict, as defined in Rule 1.7,\nfor several reasons.5  The Johnson case claims that for three years plus, USMS\nstrip searched thousands of women and not men, as a matter of USMS practice and\n4 The Fourteenth Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clause found therein, does\nnot apply to the District of Columbia, which is not a state.\n5 Plaintiffs’ counsel emphasizes to the Court that they take the D.C. Bar ethics rules\nwith utter seriousness, and do not wish to engage in any form of violation of the rules concerning\nconflicts of interest or otherwise.  Counsel will work assiduously to avoid any violation of the\nethical rules in this case and all other cases.  Defendants state in their opposition brief that they\nsee no conflict for plaintiffs’ counsel  at this time.\n17\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 18 of 23(cid:10)\npolicy. \nFirst, defendants have already agreed in open court in the Johnson\nproceedings to cease their long-standing policy lasting over several years of\nsearching the women arrestees but not the men.6  Nothing is likely to happen in the\nJohnosn case will change defendants’ standing factual admission to the Court that\nthere had been the long-standing policy. Thus, plaintiffs’ counsel cannot foresee\ndoing anything in Bame case to adversely affect the plaintiff class’ interests in\nJohnson.\nSecond, the Bame class is not seeking to prove that there never was a long-\nstanding policy of discrimination against women arrestees, but at most that there\nwas one exceptional event of illegally strip searching a relatively small group of \nmen on one day out of the many years covered by the Johnson claims.  The\nexistence of a blanket strip search in violation of the  Fourth Amendment on one\nday of men, does not disprove the Fifth Amendment claim of the women that there\n6 See , MINUTE ENTRY ORDER in Johnson v. D.C., Civil Action No 1:02-cv-\n2364 (RMC) granting [24] Consent Motion to Hold Motions in Abeyance Pending Settlement\nDiscussions.  Signed by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer on 4/28/03.(Entered: 04/28/2003).  The\nrelevant term of the consent motion is: “ the Federal Defendants will have implemented by\nMonday, April 28, 2003, new security policies and practices that will (i) permit “drop, squat and\ncough” searches or a strip search only, at the least, upon an individualized finding of reasonable\nsuspicion, if not probable cause, and with the approval of a supervisor; and (ii) insure that such\nsearches will be applied even-handedly to both men and women arrestees and detainees.”\n18\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 19 of 23(cid:10)\nwas a policy stretching over several years.\nThird,  Johnson is based on two sets of claims.  As to the first set, there is\nno conflict with the Fourth Amendment claim in Johnson, since the Bame Fourth\nAmendment claim is essentially parallel.  The Bame case claims support the\nJohnson Fourth Amendment claims, since it is legally parallel.  Hence, there is no\nadverse effect by the Bame case on the Johnson clients with respect to the Johnson\nFourth Amendment claim.\nFourth, Bame is grounded on a point of fact, which fact will be true\nregardless of how the Johnson case proceeds or how the Bame case proceeds, to\nwit, that in one apparently exceptional episode on one morning during a mass\nprotest a group of men (perhaps less than 100) were strip searched without a\nreasonable suspicion.   Any adverse effect on the Johnson plaintiff class from the\nactivities in the Bame case, might arise from this point of fact, but this event does\nnot denigrate factually the Johnson Fifth Amendment claim.  The Bame case does\nnot claim that there was a systematic policy of strip searching men over several\nyears, hence seeking to establish an argument that might adversely affect the\nJohnson plaintiffs’ position. Johnson apparently does not argue that no individual\nmen were ever strip searched, but that there was a long standing and consistent\npolicy and practice of illegally strip searching women but not men. \n19\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 20 of 23(cid:10)\nAttorney Zachary Wolfe Is Well Qualified to Handle this Case Without\nCunningham.\nDefendants contend  that Mr. Wolfe is unqualified on his own to handle this\ncase, in the event Mr. Cunningham must withdraw. P. 28.\nMr. Wolfe is well qualified to handle this matter on his own, as shown in his\naffidavit submitted in support of this motion, and, if need be, he would be able to\nadd additional experienced counsel to replace Mr. Cunningham, in the event he\nhad to withdraw.  Mr. Wolfe has more than five years successful,  relevant\nexperience in complex class action litigation. \nClass Treatment Is the Superior Method for Handling this Case. \nDefendants contend that the necessity of individualized treatment of the\nclass members’ claims precludes a finding by the Court that the predominance of\nissues requirement has been met.  The Court will have to make an individualized\ndetermination, defendants argue, of just whether each person is actually a member\nof the class, i.e., whether the strip search was reasonable.  P. 29.  Also, if the other\nclass actions had thought this were a class claim, they would have included these\nclaims as class claims.  p. 31\nThese points have already been addressed above. Plaintiffs’ have cited the\n20\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 21 of 23(cid:10)\nCourt  in their main brief to numerous cases where classes similar to this were\ncertified and where significant relief was awarded to victims of illegal strip\nsearches by government officials.

May 17, 2004); Doan\nv. Watson, 2002 WL 31730917 (S.D.Ind. 2002)(class action settlement approved);\nDefendants Should Pick up the Costs of Notifying the Class.\nDefendants contend that having the defendants pick up the costs of\nnotifying the class is unprecendented. P. 32.\nPlaintiffs suggest that the Court reserve decision as to who shall bear the\ncosts of providing notice to the class. Plaintiffs’ counsel is prepared to do so\nshould the need arise.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons and for the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ Main\nBrief in support of this motion, the Named Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification\npursuant to Rule 23(a), 23(b)(3) should be granted. \n21\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01833-RMC     Document 31-1     Filed 04/21/2006     Page 22 of 23(cid:10)\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Lynn E.

Id. ¶ 21. It is asserted that these strip searches were \"intimidating, humiliating,\nand subjected each class member to strong emotional distress.\" Id. ¶ 24. Ultimately, all arrestees were either'\nreleased on bond after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor offense such as failure to obey a police officer or\n\"incommoding,\" or were released without any charge being advanced. No arrestee was tried or convicted of any\nfelony. Id. ¶ 27. Plaintiffs filed suit on September 15, 2005. They seek class certification, damages, and attorneys'\nfees and costs.

LEGAL STANDARDS\nIn resolving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must treat the complaint's factual allegations 00 including mixed\n97\nquestions of law and fact 00 as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. Warren v. District of\n97\nColumbia, 353 F.3d 36, 40 (D.C.Cir.2004); Holy Land Found. for Relief & Dev. v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 156, 165\n(D.C.Cir.2003). It is not necessary for the plaintiff to plead all elements of his prima facie case, see Swierkiewicz\nv. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 511-14, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), or to \"plead law or match facts to\nevery element of a legal theory,\" Krieger v. Fadely, 211 F.3d 134, 136 (D.C.Cir.2000) (internal quotations and\ncitation omitted). The Court will not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim unless the defendant can show\nthat the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief. Kingman Park\nCivic Ass'n v. Williams, 348 F.3d 1033, 1040 (D.C.Cir. 2003); Gilvin v. Fire, 259 F.3d 749, 756 (D.C.Cir.2001).\n108 *108 In deciding a 12(b)(6) motion, the Court may typically consider only \"the facts alleged in the complaint,\ndocuments attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint, and matters about which the Court\nmay take judicial notice.\" Gustave-Schmidt v. Chao, 226 F.Supp.2d 191, 196 (D.D.C.2002) (citation omitted).\nHowever, the Court may, in its discretion, consider matters outside the pleadings and thereby convert a Rule 12\n(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b); Yates v. Dist. of Columbia, 324 F.3d\n724, 725 (D.C.Cir.2003).\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Claims Against Messrs. Clark and Conboy.\nThe Amended Complaint names as defendants Messrs. Clark and Conboy in their official capacities, and alleges\nagainst them causes of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for failure to train and for maintenance of an unlawful\ncustom, policy, or practice. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 49-58. Defendants move to dismiss the claims against Messrs.\nClark and Conboy on a variety of grounds, including sovereign immunity. Def.'s Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Mot.\nto Dismiss or, in the Altern., for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Mem.\") at 2-5. In response, Plaintiffs concede that they cannot\nstate official-capacity claims against those Defendants. Pl.'s Mem. of P. & A. In Opp. to Ders Mot. to Dismiss or, in\nthe Altern., for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") at 1. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendants' motion as to Messrs.\nClark and Conboy, and the claims against them will be dismissed.\nB. Timeliness of Bivens Claims.\nThe only remaining named Defendant is former Marshal Dillard, who is sued (along with unnamed Doe\ndefendants) in his individual capacity under both Bivens and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Mr. Dillard first argues that the \nBivens claim against him is subject to dismissal because it is barred by the statute of limitations.\nThe cause of action under Bivens against a federal employee who allegedly has violated a citizen's constitutional\nrights was established by the Supreme Court and is found in no statute. The Court made no explicit finding and\ngave no direction as to the appropriate statute of limitations. Therefore, the federal courts look to the law of the\nforum State, here the District of Columbia, for guidance. See, e.g., Doe v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 753 F.2d 1092,\n1114 (D.C.Cir.1985). Defendant urges the Court to adopt the one-year statute of limitations set forth at D.C.Code\n§ 12-301(4) which applies to actions \"for libel, slander, assault, battery, mayhem, wounding, malicious\nprosecution, false arrest or false imprisonment.\" Def.'s Mem. at 13. Plaintiffs argue that the statute of limitations\nin D.C.Code § 12-301(8), which gives three years to institute a suit on a cause of action \"for which a limitation is\nnot otherwise specially prescribed,\" should apply. Pl.'s Mem. at 16.\nIn this Circuit, the state of the law is that the three-year statute of limitations found in \" § [12-]301(8) applies to\nmost Bivens actions,\" unless the claim is \"for constitutional torts specifically listed\" in § 12-301(4). Banks v.\nChesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 802 F.2d 1416, 1428-29 (D.C.Cir.1986) (citing Hobson v. Wilson, 737 F.2d 1, 32\n(D.C.Cir.1984)). Defendant need not fear that the Circuit (or this Court) is blindly relying on Wilson v. Garcia, 471\nU.S. 261, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), which applied the personal injury statute of limitations to\nactions under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. According to Defendant, \"[c]ourts in other jurisdictions have . . . incorrectly\n\n109 assumed that *109 the statutory analysis applied in Wilson should also be applied in the Bivens context.\" Defs.'\nMem. at 13 n. 4. In Banks, the D.C. Circuit addressed Garcia and noted that \"[i]f the Garcia opinion also applies\nto Bivens actions, this case-by-case approach will no longer be valid.\" Id. at 1429 n. 22. Banks, which is\ncontrolling, recognized that the personal injury statute of limitations does not automatically apply to Bivens\nclaims.\nThe question is, therefore, whether or not Plaintiffs' claims 00 as pled in the Amended Complaint 00 are most\n97 97\nanalogous to the specific torts identified in § 12-301(4). Mr. Dillard cites Profitt v. District of Columbia, 790 F.Supp.\n304, 310 (D.D.C. 1991), for the proposition that strip searches would constitute an assault if not lawfully\nconducted. Finding the statute of limitations for assault to be one year under § 12-301(4), he argues that the \nBivens claim is untimely. Def.'s Reply Mem. at 17. Plaintiffs argue that their Bivens claim is in the nature of a\npersonal injury claim and, as explicitly pled in the Amended Complaint, a violation of their Fourth Amendment\nrights to be free from unreasonable searches. Pl.'s Mem. at 16-17. Since neither of these kinds of claims is\nspecifically listed in § 12-301(4), they rely on § 12-301(8)'s three-year limitations period. Id.\nIn deciding a motion to dismiss, the Court must give the Plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable inferences that\nmight be found in their complaint. The Amended Complaint specifically alleges that the Plaintiffs \"have a right\nprotected under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution not to be subjected to unreasonable\nsearches and seizures by persons acting under United States . . . governmental authority.\" First Am. Compl. ¶ 31.\nLooking at this allegation in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court does not agree that it is analogous to\nan assault claim. Although the allegedly unconstitutional search was of Plaintiffs' bodies and may have\nconstituted an assault if not authorized by law, the harm transcends that of a mere assault. The alleged injury\nwas not only to Plaintiffs' bodies and personal dignity, it was allegedly to Plaintiffs' rights against unwarranted\ngovernment intrusion into places in which they had a reasonable expectation of privacy. .The Court will not\nshortchange the Plaintiffs' pleading and erase its constitutional allegations by transforming the suit into a\ncommon-law assault case 00 especially at this stage in the proceedings. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the \n97\nBivens claim as untimely will be denied.\nC. Section 1983 Claims.\nMr. Dillard moves to dismiss the § 1983 claim against him because only state actors can violate § 1983 and Mr.\nDillard was a federal employee. Def.'s Mem. at 5-12. Plaintiffs do not dispute that § 1983 applies only to state\nactors; rather, they argue that the D.C. Superior Court Marshals also serve as agents of the District of Columbia\nwhen they hold arrestees in the Superior Court jail cells and, therefore, are potentially subject to liability as\n\"State\" actors. Pl.'s Mem. at 19-21.\nThe Court concludes that the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges that former Marshal Dillard and the\nunnamed Doe defendants were acting under color of D.C. law when they strip searched Plaintiffs and the\nputative class members. Specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges that former Marshal Dillard and the Doe\ndefendants were acting jointly with the District of Columbia and the MPD for purposes of policing the conduct of\nprotestors on September 27, 2002, and that former Marshal Dillard and his deputies derived their authority over\n110 Plaintiffs from cooperative *110 agreements between the District of Columbia and the Marshal's Service. First\nAm. Comp. ¶¶ 40-41. Plaintiffs also contend that former Marshal Dillard's conduct was funded in part by the\nDistrict of Columbia. Id. at ¶ 42. These allegations 00 while scant 00 sufficiently allege state action. See Williams v.\n97 97\nUnited States, 396 F.3d 412, 414 (D.C.Cir.2005) (holding that a person may be considered a state actor for\npurposes of § 1983 if he is a \"willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents.\"); see also Case v.\nMilewski, 327 F.3d 564, 567 (7th Cir.2003) (\"it is assumed that a § 1983 action can lie against federal employees\n00 as it can against private individuals 00 if they conspire or act in concert with state officials to deprive a person, of\n97 97\nher civil rights under color of state law.\"); cf. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc., 457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct.\n2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982) (holding that conduct is actionable under § 1983 if it is \"fairly attributable to the\nState.\").\nFormer Marshal Dillard disputes these allegations and argues that there was no concerted action between him\nand the District of Columbia. See Def.'s Mem. at 11-12. But because Mr. Dillard submitted no evidence\nsupporting the factual contentions in his briefs, the Court declines to exercise its discretion to convert the motion\ninto one for summary judgment. This does not mean, of course, that Plaintiffs have established that former\n\nMarshal Dillard was a state actor; discovery may' well prove that he was not Moreover, the Court's ruling does not\nmean that Plaintiffs are free to pursue both their Bivens theory and their § 1983 theory all the way to trial. The\nCourt construes the Amended Complaint to present alternative theories of liability based on Plaintiffs' current\ninformation and belief, which they may do at the pleading stage. See, e.g., Weyrich v. New Republic, Inc., 235\nF.3d 617, 628 (D.C.Cir.2001) (holding that plaintiffs may plead similar but mutually exclusive torts in the\nalternative). Once discovery has concluded, Mr. Dillard will be free to move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' §\n1983 claim 00 assuming, of course, that the facts ultimately support his contention that he was a not a state actor.\n97\nD. Qualified Immunity.\nMr. Dillard also argues that regardless of what theory of liability is asserted against him, he is entitled to qualified\nimmunity for any claims arising out of alleged strip searches at the D.C. Superior Court. Def.'s Mem. at 16-24.\nThe first step in deciding if qualified immunity applies is to determine whether the complaint alleges the\ndeprivation of a constitutional right. Int'l Action Ctr. v. United States, 365 F.3d 20, 24 (D.C.Cir.2004). Mr. Dillard's\narguments as to why the strip searches were reasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment are based on\na wide range of factual contentions, many of which Plaintiffs dispute. See Def.'s Mem. at 21-23; Pl.'s Mem. at 5-7,\n10. Given that the constitutionality of the strip searches depends, inter alia, upon what facts were known to and\nconsidered by the officers who conducted the searches, the Court declines to consider Defendants' argument\nuntil a more fully developed factual record is established through discovery. Because the Court declines to\nconvert Defendants' motion into one for summary judgment, it will deny Plaintiffs' motion to take discovery under\nRule 56(f) as unnecessary. For purposes of the present motion, the Amended Complaint alleges that U.S.\nMarshals subjected class members to blanket strip searches without a reasonable individualized suspicion that\nthe class members were concealing weapons or contraband. See, e.g., First Am. Compl. ¶ 21. These allegations,\n111 if true, could establish violations of the *111 Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 62-66\n(2d Cir.2001) (holding that a county jail's blanket strip search policy violated Fourth Amendment).\nEven though Plaintiffs have alleged the violation of a constitutional right, former Marshal Dillard may still be\nentitled to qualified immunity at this stage if the constitutional right was not clearly established at the time of the\nalleged violation. See Int'l Action Ctr., 365 F.3d at 24. Although there are no D.C. Circuit opinions addressing the\nexact conduct alleged here, relevant Supreme Court authority provides sufficiently clear guidance to government\nofficials regarding the proper scope of strip searches of arrestees such as the putative class members. See Bell\nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (establishing a balancing test to\ndetermine whether a strip search is valid under the Fourth Amendment). Based on Bell, the Court finds that it\nwould have been clear to any reasonable official in former Marshal Dillard's position that strip searching all\nmisdemeanor arrestees in the putative class, without any individualized suspicion that they were concealing\ncontraband, was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, former Marshal Dillard is not entitled\nto qualified immunity at this stage in the proceeding.\nE. Lack of Standing.\nFinally, Defendants argue for dismissal on the ground that the named Plaintiffs are inadequate to represent the\nclass because their names do, not appear on the Lock Up lists which they attached to their motion for class\ncertification. Def.'s Mem. at 14. This argument is, obviously, more properly considered in the context of Plaintiffs'\nmotion for class certification, not in this motion to dismiss. The Court will therefore consider this argument when\nthe time is right.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Defendants' motion to dismiss in part and deny it in part. Because\nPlaintiffs concede that they cannot state official capacity claims against Messrs. Clark and Conboy, the motion as\nto those Defendants will be granted. The motion will be denied, however, as to the claims against former Marshal\nDillard because the Amended Complaint adequately alleges both a Bivens claim and, in the alternative, a § 1983\nclaim against him. A memorializing order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\nORDER\nFor the reasons stated in the Memorandum Opinion filed separately and contemporaneously herewith, it is\nhereby\nORDERED that\n1. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment [Dkt. # 30] is GRANTED IN PART\nand DENIED IN PART:\na. Defendants' motion to dismiss the claims against John F. Clark and Steve Conboy (First Am.\nCompl. Counts 3 and 4) is GRANTED;\nb. Defendants' motion to dismiss the claims against Todd Dillard (First Am. Compl. Counts 1 and\n2) is DENIED;\n2. Plaintiffs' Motion to Take Discovery [Dkt. # 35] and Motion Stay Consideration of Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. # 36]\nare DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] The putative class in this case is confined to male arrestees because, according to Plaintiffs, the claims of\nfemale arrestees \"are addressed under separate litigation.\" First Am. Compl. ¶ 28. The Court assumes that\nPlaintiffs are referring to Johnson v. District of Columbia, Case No. 02-cv-2364 (RMC), which is being brought on\nbehalf of female individuals who were strip searched at the D.C. Superior Court. The Court acknowledges, but\nexpresses no opinion regarding, the apparent inconsistencies between the factual allegations in Johnson and this\ncase.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Mark Nebeker, Assistant U.S. Attorney, argued the \ncause for appellant.  With him on the briefs were Ronald C. \nMachen Jr., U.S. Attorney, and R. Craig Lawrence, Assistant \nU.S. Attorney.\nLynn  E.  Cunningham argued  the  cause  for  appellees.  \nWith him on the brief was Zachary Wolfe.\nBefore:  GINSBURG and  ROGERS, Circuit  Judges,  and \nWILLIAMS,Senior Circuit Judge.\nOpinion for the Court filed by Circuit JudgeGINSBURG.\n\n2\nDissenting opinion filed by Circuit JudgeROGERS.\nGINSBURG, Circuit Judge: The named plaintiffs filed this\nclass action suit for damages against Todd Walther Dillard, a\nformer United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the \nDistrict  of  Columbia, claiming that,  after  being  arrested \nduring  a  demonstration  in  September  2002,  they  were \nunconstitutionally  strip  searched  by  Deputy  U.S.  Marshals \nunder Dillard’s direction. According to the plaintiffs, caselaw \nhad by then clearly established that the Fourth Amendment to \nthe  Constitution  of  the  United  States prohibited strip \nsearching  a  person  arrested  for  a  non-violent,  non-drug-\nrelated misdemeanor absent a particularized reason to suspect \nthe arrestee was concealing contraband or weapons about his \nperson. Dillard moved for summary judgment based upon \nqualified immunity, and when the district court denied that \nmotion, brought this interlocutory appeal. We conclude it\nwas not clearly established in 2002 that the strip search of a \nperson being introduced into a detention facility violated the \nFourth Amendment.  Therefore, Dillard is entitled to qualified \nimmunity and to summary judgment.\nI. Background\nIn 1999 the  United  States  Marshals  Service  (USMS) \nadopted Policy Directive No. 99-25 to prescribe, among other \nthings, the procedure for strip searching prisoners and “other \npersons  who  are  under  arrest.” The  Policy  Directive \nauthorized a “strip search,” defined as “[a] complete search of \na prisoner’s attire and a visual inspection of the prisoner’s \nnaked  body,  including  body  cavities,” when  “there  is \nreasonable suspicion that the prisoner may be (a) carrying \ncontraband and/or weapons, or (b) considered to be a security,\nescape, and/or suicide risk.”  “Reasonable suspicion” was to \nbe determined according to the following criteria:\n\n3\na. Serious nature of the offense(s) charged, i.e., whether \ncrime of violence or drugs;\nb. Prisoner’s appearance or demeanor;\nc. Circumstances  surrounding  the prisoner’s  arrest  or \ndetention; i.e., whether  the  prisoner  has  been \nconvicted or is a pretrial detainee;\nd. Prisoner’s criminal history;\ne. Type  and  security  level  of  institution  in  which  the \nprisoner is detained; or\nf. History of discovery of contraband and/or weapons, \neither on the prisoner individually or in the institution \nin which prisoners are detained.\nDillard was the United States Marshal for the Superior \nCourt of the District of Columbia when the plaintiffs were \narrested and allegedly strip searched. Under his supervision,\nall  male  arrestees  held  at the  Superior  Court  were strip \n(cid:2)\nsearched upon arrival, before being put into the cellblock;\nmore specifically, each male arrestee was required to drop his \ntrousers and underwear, bend over or squat, and expose his \nbuttocks  and  genitals  to  a  male  Deputy  Marshal. This \npractice had been instituted in light of an extensive history of \nprisoners’ concealing contraband on their bodies while in the \ncellblock. In the four years prior to the plaintiffs’ arrests, the \nUSMS had documented at least 30 incidents in which Deputy \nMarshals discovered contraband — including drugs, knives, \n(cid:2)\nDillard denies this procedurewas “followed in practice,” although \nhe  concedes  for  purposes  of  the  appeal  that  the  strip  searches \noccurred in this case.  In settlement of Morgan v. Barry, Civ. A. \nNo. 81-1419 (D.D.C. 1981), the District of Columbia had signed a \nMemorandum of Agreement not to strip search female arrestees \nprior to arraignment without individualized, reasonable suspicion or \nunless the arrestee was to come into contact with the general inmate \npopulation of the detention facility.  The practice of strip searching \nall male arrestees is no longer in place at the Superior Court.\n\n4\nrazor blades, and box cutters — on prisoners brought to the \nSuperior Court cellblock by law enforcement.\nMetropolitan Police officers arrested the plaintiffs on the \nmorning of September 27, 2002 while they were protesting a\nmeeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World \nBank in downtown Washington, D.C. The officers initially \ntransported the protestors to various police holding facilities;\nlater that day, the officers bused the named plaintiffs and \nothers to  the  Superior  Court and transferred  them  to  the \ncustody of the USMS. Because the plaintiffs had refused to \nidentify themselves to law enforcement authorities, they were \nrecorded as “John Does” on the “lockup list” provided to the \nDeputy Marshals.\nAt the Superior Court, each plaintiff first passed through \na metal detector and was then subjected to a pat-down search.\nThe Deputy Marshals then strip searched the arrestees in a \nreceiving  cell  in  batches  of  approximately  ten  men; no\nplaintiff was touched and no female was present during the \nsearch. No contraband was recovered from any plaintiff.\nAfter being strip searched, groups of 20 to 30 men were \nplaced together in holding cells to await disposition of the\ncharges against them. Each had been charged with either \n“incommoding” traffic or “failure to obey” a law enforcement \nofficer, both of which are misdemeanors. On September 28 \nthey were released, some having been fined and others not \nsentenced at all.\nThe named plaintiffs  filed  this class  action  seeking \ndamages  from  Dillard  pursuant  to Bivens  v.  Six  Unknown \nNamed Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 \n(1971).  They claimed the strip searches, because performed\n\n5\nwithout individualized suspicion, violated their right under the \nFourth Amendment to be free from unreasonablesearches.\nThe district court certified a class of plaintiffs consisting \nof:\nAll men who were: (1) arrested on September 27, 2002 \nby the D.C. Police officials during a series of mass \nprotests in downtown Washington, D.C.; (2) remanded \nby D.C. Police, following their arrests, into the custody \nof  the  U.S.  Marshal[]  for  the  District  of  Columbia \nprior to being released; and (3) subjected by deputy \nU.S. Marshals to a strip, visual, body cavity search \nwithout any particularized or individualized reasonable \nsuspicion that he was concealing drugs, weapons or \nother contraband. ...\nThe plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the issue of \nliability and Dillard moved for judgment on the pleadings or, \nin  the  alternative,  for  summary  judgment,  arguing he  was \nentitled to qualified immunity under Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. \n194, 200–02 (2001).\nThe district court denied Dillard’s motion.  It concluded \nthe strip searches violated the Fourth Amendment and held \nDillard was not entitled to qualified immunity “because the \nlaw was clearly established that blanket strip searches of non-\nviolent, non-felony arrestees were unlawful” in 2002.  Bame \nv. Dillard, 647 F. Supp. 2d 43, 52, 55 (2009). The court also \ndenied the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment because \nDillard had denied the strip searches occurred, thus creating a\ngenuine issue of material fact. For the purpose of this appeal,\nhowever, Dillard concedes the strip searches took place as\nalleged.\n\n6\nII. Analysis\nThe only issue on appeal is whether Dillard is entitled to \nqualified immunity, which issue we resolve de novo. Elder v. \nHolloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516 (1994). Qualified immunity is \n“a defense that shields officials from suit if their conduct \n‘d[id] not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional \nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.’”  \nOrtiz v. Jordan, 131 S. Ct. 884, 888 (2011) (quoting Harlow \nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  The Supreme Court \nin Saucier established a two-step test for determining whether \na government official is entitled to qualified immunity.  First, \nthe court asks whether “the facts alleged show the officer's \nconduct violated a constitutional right.” 533 U.S. at 201.  If \nso,  then  the court  must  determine “whether  the  right  was \nclearly established” at the time of the alleged violation. Id.\nThe Supreme Court has since clarified that “the sequence set \nforth  [in  Saucier],”  although “often  appropriate,”  is  not\nmandatory. Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 818 (2009).\nCourts  may “exercise  their  sound  discretion”  in  deciding \nwhich question to address first “in light of the circumstances \nin the particular case at hand.” Id.\nIn  this  case  the  principle of  constitutional  avoidance \ncounsels that we turn directly to the second question. As the \nCourt recognized in Pearson itself, “There are cases in which\nit is plain that a constitutional right is not clearly established\nbut far from obvious whether in fact there is such a right.” Id.\nThis is such a case.\nTherefore the first and, as it happens, only question we \naddress is whether it was clearly established in September \n2002 that strip searching an arrestee before placing him in a\ndetention facility without individualized, reasonable suspicion \nwas unconstitutional.  To answer this question, “we look to \n\n7\ncases from the Supreme Court and this court, as well as to \ncases  from  other  courts  exhibiting  a  consensus  view,”\nJohnson v. District of Columbia, 528 F.3d 969, 976 (D.C. Cir. \n2008) — if there is one. The facts of such cases need not be \n“‘materially similar’ ... but have only to show that ‘the state of \nthe law [at the time of the incident] gave [the officer] fair \nwarning  that  [his  alleged  misconduct]  ...  was \nunconstitutional.’” Id. (quoting Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, \n741 (2002)).\nCentral to our inquiry in this case, as reflected in the \nbriefs of both parties, is the decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 \n(cid:2)\nU.S. 520 (1979). There pretrial detainees and others housed\nin the New York Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), a \n“short-term  custodial  facility,”  challenged the \nconstitutionality of strip searching each inmate who had been\nvisited by an  outsider, without  regard  to  individualized \nsuspicion. Id. at 523, 558–60. The Court noted that, under \nthe  Fourth  Amendment  generally,  the  reasonableness of  a \nsearch is to be determined by balancing “the scope of the \nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the \njustification  for  initiating  it,  and  the  place  in  which  it  is \nconducted.”  Id.at 559.\nApplying this general “test of reasonableness,” id., the \nCourt  in  Bell  upheld  the  policy  of  the  MCC  because  the\n“legitimate security interests of the institution” in preventing \nthe introduction of contraband into the facility outweighed the \ninmates’ interest in privacy: “A detention facility is a unique \nplace  fraught  with  serious  security  dangers,”  where the\n(cid:2)\nThe MCC also housed some convicted inmates, “witnesses in \nprotective custody, and persons incarcerated for contempt.”  Bell,\n441 U.S. at 524.  All were subject to the same policy of strip \nsearching.\n\n8\n“[s]muggling  of  money,  drugs,  weapons,  and  other \ncontraband is all too common an occurrence.”  Id. at 559–60.\nConsequently, corrections officials are to be “accorded wide-\nranging deference” in adopting policies needed “to maintain \ninstitutional security.” Id. at 547–48. In so stating, the Court \nexpressly rejected the plaintiff inmates’ argument that less\ndeference is due to an official holding detainees — as was \nDillard in this case —as opposed toconvicts. Id. at 547 n.29.\nDillard  argues  Bell establishes the  strip  searches \nconducted  at  the  Superior  Court  were not  clearly\nunconstitutional. For their part, the plaintiffs contend there \nwas  by  2002  — when  the  searches  here  occurred  — a\nconsensus among the circuits to have considered the issue that \nBell required individualized, reasonable suspicion to support\nthe strip search of “persons arrested for non-violent non-drug \n(cid:2)\nrelated misdemeanor offenses.”\nDillard responds with the decisions in Powell v. Barrett,\n541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008)(en banc), and Bull v. City and \nCounty of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010) (en \nbanc), which he says created a conflict among the circuits as\nto  the  meaning of  Bell. In  Powell,  the  Eleventh  Circuit \n(cid:2)\nThe plaintiffs cite Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir. \n2001), which was overruled by Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 \n(11th Cir. 2008) (en banc); Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107 \n(1st Cir. 2001); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989); \nWeber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986); Jones v. Edwards, 770 \nF.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985);Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153 \n(5th Cir. 1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984), \nwhich was overruled by Bull v. City and County of San Francisco,\n595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d \n391 (10th Cir. 1984); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d \n1263 (7th Cir. 1983); and Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. \n1981).\n\n9\nupheld the “practice of strip searching all arrestees as part of \nthe process of booking them into the general population of a \ndetention  facility,  even  without  reasonable  suspicion  to \nbelieve that they may be concealing contraband.”  541 F.3d at \n1300. In  Bull,  the  Ninth  Circuit similarly  concluded the \npolicy  of the  San  Francisco  Sheriff’s  Department  of  strip \nsearching all arrestees upon introduction into the general jail \npopulation did  not violate  the  Fourth  Amendment,  and \ntherefore reversed the district court’s denial of the sheriff’s \nmotion  for  summary  judgment  based  upon  qualified \nimmunity. 595 F.3d at 966.\nThe plaintiffs argue we should disregard Powell and Bull\nbecause they were decided after the strip searches at issue \nhere and were therefore unknown to Dillard at the relevant \ntime. Alternatively, they  would have us distinguish these \ncases because  they  addressed  the  rights  of  persons  being \nbooked  into  a  general  jail  population for “housing  them \novernight or longer.” The plaintiffs also point to other cases \nthey say gave Dillard “fair warning” that strip searching the \nplaintiffs was unconstitutional. These include a March 2002 \ndecision of the District Court observing that “[m]ost federal \ncourts  of  appeals”  had  agreed “that  strip  searches  of \nindividuals  arrested  for  minor  offenses  violate  the  Fourth \nAmendment unless the individual is reasonably suspected of \nconcealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband,” Helton v. \nUnited States, 191 F. Supp. 2d 179, 184 (D.D.C. 2002), an\nunpublished  Ninth  Circuit  decision, ACT  UP!/Portland  v. \nBagley, No. 93-35592, 1995 WL 375822, at (cid:2)5 (June 22, \n1995), denying qualified immunity to the Deputy Marshals \nwho had strip searched demonstrators who had been arrested,\nand the Memorandum of Agreement in Morgan v. Barry, Civ. \nA. No. 81-1419, discussed above at 3 n.(cid:2).\n\n10\nWe conclude the law in 2002 did not clearly establish \nthat strip searching all male arrestees prior to placement in \nholding  cells  at the  Superior  Court  violated  the  Fourth \nAmendment. The governing precedent was then, as it is now, \nBell v. Wolfish, and nothing in Bell requires individualized, \nreasonable suspicion before strip searching a person entering\na detention facility.  To the contrary, as the Eleventh Circuit \nwould  later point out, “The  Bell decision  means  that  the \nFourth Amendment does not require reasonable suspicion for \nthis type of strip search in detention facilities.”  Powell, 541 \nF.3d at 1308.\nThe dissent places great weight upon a passage in Wilson \nv. Layne in which the Supreme Court suggested the plaintiffs \nthere could have prevailed by identifying  “a  consensus of \n[lower  court]  cases  of  persuasive  authority  such  that  a \nreasonable officer could not have believed that his actions \nwere lawful.”  526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999). We are aware of no\nSupreme  Court  case,  however, that  suggests  a  reasonable \nofficer  could  not  have  believed  his actions were  lawful \ndespite a  consensus  among  the  courts  of  appeals when  a \nprecedent of the Supreme Court supports the lawfulness of his \nconduct.\nA different reading of Bell by the several circuits to have \nconsidered the issue before 2002 could not “clearly establish”\nthe unconstitutionality of strip searches in this context. That \nPowell and Bullcame down after 2002 is of no moment; those \nopinions simply accord with our own understanding that Bell\ndid not establish the unconstitutionality of a strip search under \n(cid:2)\nconditions like those present here. 1WILLIAMBLACKSTONE,\n(cid:2)\nSince oral argument in this case, the Third Circuit has joined the \nEleventh and the Ninth Circuits in upholding the constitutionality \nof strip searching all arrestees upon their introduction into a general \n\n11\nCOMMENTARIES (cid:2)70–71 (If a “judge may mistake the law,” \nthen “subsequent judges do not pretend to make a new law, \nbut to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation”). Indeed, \nthe Eleventh Circuit expressly  considered and  rejected the \npre-2002 decisions of  the  circuits  requiring reasonable,\nindividualized suspicion before conducting a strip search at a\ndetention facility, Powell, 541 F.3d at 1306–07, and the Ninth \nCircuit likewise rejected those decisions requiring reasonable,\nindividualized suspicion  before  strip  searching  an  arrestee \nentering a general jail population, Bull, 595 F.3d at 980–81.\nIn other words,those courts did not believe the prior decisions\nupon which the plaintiffs rely had established — much less \nclearly established — that strip searches of the sort here at \nissue  were  unconstitutional. Why,  then,  should  Marshal \nDillard have believed that?\nClearly, it was reasonable for Dillard, like the courts of \nappeal  that  reached  the  issue  after  2002, to  believe strip \nsearching all male arrestees was consistent with the law as set \nforth in Bell and as implemented by the USMS in Policy \nDirective No. 99-25. The correctional center in Bell, like the \nSuperior Court cellblock, was used primarily to house not \nconvicts but persons awaiting their appearance in court. 441\nU.S.  at  524. The  dissent  makes  much  of  the  distinction \nbetween “pretrial detainees” and “pre-arraigned arrestees” in \nits attempt to distinguish this case from Bell.  As the court in \njail population.  Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, 621 F.3d \n296 (3d Cir. 2010); but see Jimenez v. Wood Cnty., 621 F.3d 372, \n375–76  (5th  Cir.  2010)  (following  circuit  precedent  in  holding \nreasonable  suspicion  is  required  to  strip  search  an  individual\narrested for a minor offense); Stearns v. Clarkson, 615 F.3d 1278,\n1282 (10th  Cir.  2010)  (circuit  precedent  clearly  established “a\ndetainee who is not placed in the general prison population cannot \nbe strip searched” without reasonable suspicion) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n12\nPowell observed,  however,  “The  policy  that  the  Court \ncategorically upheld in Bell applied to all inmates, including \nthose charged with lesser offenses and even those charged \nwith no wrongdoing at all who were being held as witnesses \nin protective custody.” 541 F.3d at 1307.  Thus, the purported \ndistinction  “finds  no  basis  in  the  Bell decision,  in  the \nreasoning of that decision, or in the real world of detention \nfacilities.” Id. at 1310. Because many arrestees, including \n“[d]emonstrators or protestors engaged in civil disobedience, \n... have all the time they need to plan their arrests and conceal \nitems on their persons,” id. at 1313–14, we have no reason to \nbelieve arrested demonstrators are any less a threat to security \nthan are pretrial detainees.  \nFurthermore, the Court’s rationale in Bell applies equally\nto any detention facility that is “fraught with serious security \ndangers,” id. at 559, as was the cellblock at the Superior \nCourt, where often hundreds of arrestees were processed in a \nsingle day.  Contrary to the plaintiffs’ contention, nothing \nwhatsoever in Bell suggests its holding is limited to overnight \ndetention facilities. Cf. Powell, 541 F.3d at 1310 (“The need \nfor  strip  searches  at  all detention  facilities  ...  is  not \nexaggerated”) (emphasis added). Nor—despite the emphasis \nour  dissenting  colleague  places  upon  “intermingling”  with \nother arrestees or detainees — did the Court in Bell anywhere \nmention, let alone rely upon, such intermingling as a reason \nfor upholding the strip searches.  In any event, arrestees held \nat the Superior Court were in fact commingled with other \narrestees in holding cells; no one suggests each arrestee was \nput in a separate cell.\nMoreover, the Court in Bell upheld strip searches even \nthough “there ha[d] been only one instance where an MCC \ninmate was discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into \nthe institution on his person.”  441 U.S. at 559. As the Court \n\n13\nspeculated, the dearth of incidents may be a “testament to the \neffectiveness of this search technique as a deterrent.” Id. Be \nthat as it may, the record here substantiates Dillard’s point \nthat  the  Superior  Court  had  a  persistent  problem  with\ncontraband being smuggled into the cellblock, the veryreason\nfor strip searches contemplated in subsection (f) of Policy \nDirective No. 99-25.  Furthermore, the strip searches at the \nSuperior Court were no more intrusive than those upheld as \nreasonable in Bell, where a male was required to “lift his \ngenitals  and  bend  over  to  spread  his  buttocks  for  visual \ninspection.” 441 U.S. at 558n.39.\nContrary  to  our  dissenting  colleague’s  assertion, \ndecisions of the courts of appeals reached after the events here \nin suit are relevant to the issue of qualified immunity.  In \ndetermining  whether  an  official  is  entitled  to  qualified \nimmunity, courts focus upon the state of the law “at the time \n[the] action occurred” because “i[f] the law at that time was \nnot  clearly  established,”  then  the official “could  not \nreasonably  be  expected  to  anticipate  subsequent  legal \ndevelopments.” Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818.  The point is not, as \nthe dissent would have it, to deny an official the benefit of \nsubsequent cases reflecting the uncertain state of the law at \nthe time of his action. As the Supreme Court in Pearson said \nof its earlier decision in Wilson v. Layne, there “a Circuit split \non the relevant issue had developed after the events that gave \nrise  to  suit”;  the  Court  nonetheless  “concluded that  ‘[i]f \njudges thus disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair \nto subject police to money damages for picking the losing side \nof the controversy.’”  Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 823 (quoting 526 \nU.S. at 618).  So, too, here would it be unfair to subject \nDillard  to  money  damages  for  having  relied  upon  the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Bell.\n\n14\nIII. Conclusion\nBecause  there  was  in  2002  no  clearly  established \nconstitutional prohibition of strip searching arrestees without \nindividualized, reasonable suspicion, we need  not consider\nwhether Dillard had individual suspicion as to each of the \nplaintiffs. The order of the district court is reversed and the\ncaseis remanded for that court to enter summary judgment for \nthe defendant.\nSo ordered.\n\nROGERS, Circuit  Judge,  dissenting:      Contrary  to  the\nprinciples underlying qualified immunity as a limitation on the\noccasions when liability for unconstitutional conduct by a\npublic official will be excused, the majority holds the conduct\nis to be evaluated by recently articulated law and not, as the\nSupreme Court has instructed, by the clearly established law\nreflected in the consensus of persuasive authority at the time of\nthe conduct.  In so doing, this is the first time a circuit court of\nappeals  has  suggested  that  the  protections  of  the  Fourth\nAmendment to the Constitution against unreasonable searches\ndo not extend to an individual arrested for a non-violent minor\noffense who is awaiting arraignment apart from the general\npopulation of detainees, and is subjected to a strip search in the\nabsence of reasonable suspicion he is hiding contraband or\nweapons.  This runs contrary to the consensus of ten circuit\ncourts of appeals at the time of the challenged strip searches. \nTo reach this result the majority tramples over Supreme Court\nprecedent and gives short shrift to the protections of the Fourth\nAmendment.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.  \nI.\nThe  former  United  States  Marshal  for  the  District  of\nColumbia appeals on the ground that he is entitled to qualified\nimmunity with respect to the alleged violations of the Fourth\nAmendment by peaceful protesters who in 2002 were subjected\nto pre-arraignment strip searches at the D.C. Superior Court cell\nblock.1  The plaintiffs came to the Nation’s Capital to protest\nthe policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World\nBank on the occasion of the institutions’ annual meetings on\nSeptember 27, 2002.  They were arrested for either of two non-\nviolent misdemeanors, “incommoding,” D.C. Code § 22-1307,\n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau\nof Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).\n\n2\nor  failure  to  obey  a  police  officer, id., § 22-1121.  They\nremained together while in police custody throughout the day,\nand they were allowed to keep their personal property, such as\nknapsacks. Upon being turned over to the custody of the U.S.\nMarshals Service at the D.C. Superior Court,  they were  patted\ndown and screened by a magnetometer before entering the cell\nblock;  no contraband or weapons were found.  They then were\nsubjected to drop-squat-and-cough strip searches; no contraband\nor weapons were found. They were released from custody upon\nbeing arraigned by a judicial officer of the Superior Court\nwithout being intermingled with other arrestees or committed to\na detention facility to await trial.  See Bame, et al. v. Dillard,\n647 F. Supp. 2d 43, 47–48 (D.D.C. 2009).\nTwo Supreme Court cases elucidate the relevant qualified\nimmunity principles that the majority ignores in relying on\ndevelopments in the law subsequent to the challenged strip\nsearches.  First, in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982),\nthe Supreme Court held that “government officials performing\ndiscretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for\ncivil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly\nestablished  statutory  or  Constitutional  rights  of  which  a\nreasonable person would have known.” Id. at 818.  The Court\nobserved:\nReliance  on  the  objective  reasonableness  of  an\nofficial’s conduct, as measured by reference to clearly\nestablished law, should avoid excessive disruption of\ngovernment  and  permit  the  resolution  of  many\ninsubstantial  claims  on  summary  judgment.  On\nsummary  judgment,  the  judge  appropriately  may\ndetermine, not only the currently applicable law, but\nwhether that law was clearly established at the time an\naction occurred.\n\n3\nId.  (emphasis  supplied  and  footnote  omitted).    The  Court\nemphasized that “[b]y defining the limits of qualified immunity\nessentially in objective terms, we provide no license to lawless\nconduct.” Id. at 819.  Thus, “[w]here an official could be\nexpected to know that certain conduct would violate statutory\nor Constitutional rights, he should be made to hesitate; and a\nperson who suffers injury caused by such conduct may have a\ncause of action.” Id. at 819.\nWhile emphasizing that “a reasonably competent public\nofficial should know the law governing his conduct,” id. at 819,\nthe Court reserved judgment on the “circumstances under which\n‘the state of the law’ should be ‘evaluated by reference to the\nopinions of this Court, of the Courts of Appeals, or of the local\nDistrict  Court,’”  id.  at  819  n.32  (quoting  Procunier  v.\nNavarette, 434 U.S. 555, 565 (1978)).  In Wilson v. Layne, 526\nU.S. 603 (1999), the Court resolved this dilemma by concluding\nthat “cases of controlling authority in their jurisdiction” or “a\nconsensus of cases of persuasive authority” could suffice.  Id.\nat 617.  In Harlow, the Court had observed that “an official\ncould not reasonably be expected to anticipate subsequent legal\ndevelopments.”  457 U.S. at 818. Rather, the law at the time of\nthe challenged conduct would be the measure of his eligibility\nfor qualified immunity.  See id.\nSecond,  in  Safford  Unified  School  District  No.  1  v.\nRedding, 129 S. Ct. 2633 (2009), the Supreme Court, continuing\nto focus on the law at the time of the challenged conduct,\nreiterated  that  there  need  not  be  a  prior  factually\nindistinguishable case in order for qualified immunity to be\ndenied: “there is no need that ‘the very action in question [have]\npreviously been held unlawful.’” Id. at 2643 (quoting Wilson v.\nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 615 (1999) (alteration in original)). \nAlthough  “[t]he  unconstitutionality  of  outrageous  conduct\nobviously will be unconstitutional,” the Court observed that\n\n4\n“even as to action less than an outrage, officials can still be on\nnotice that their conduct violates established law . . . in novel\nfactual circumstances.”  Id. at 2643 (quoting Hope v. Pelzer,\n536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002) (alteration in original)).\nPrior to the events in Redding, the issue regarding searches\nof students had been addressed in only a handful of cases and\nthey went both ways.  Id. at 2643–44.  The Court, therefore,\nfocused on the extent to which the mixed case law suggested\nthat a previous Supreme Court decision, New Jersey v. T.L.O.,\n469 U.S. 325 (1985), did not definitively resolve the issue.  Id.\nThe analysis is different in the instant case because in 2002 the\nlaw of the circuit courts of appeals was uniform and had been\nfor some time, much as in Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808,\n822–23  (2009),  where  the  Supreme  Court  concluded  the\nnarcotics  task  force  officers    were  entitled  to  rely  on  the\nconsensus among the courts at the time they allowed the media\nto accompany them upon entering Pearson’s home that their\nconduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment, despite the lack\nof a ruling from the officers’ own federal circuit, id. at 823. \nMarshal Dillard characterizes the Supreme Court’s decision in\nBellv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), as permitting visual body-\ncavity inspections in an institutional setting for security reasons,\nand  thus  permitting  the  challenged  strip  searches.    This\ncharacterization, however, fails to take into account the question\nleft open in Bell, the evolution of the law addressing that\nquestion between 1979 and 2002, or the factual differences\nbetween the judicially committed pretrial detainees in Belland\nthe pre-arraignment arrestees in the instant case.\nA.\nBell v. Wolfish involved the treatment of pretrial detainees\nwho had been committed to “a federally operated short-term\ncustodial facility in New York City designed primarily to house\npretrial detainees” that also housed “some convicted inmates\n\n5\nwho are awaiting sentencing or transportation to a federal prison\nor who are serving generally relatively short sentences.” 441\nU.S. at 523–24.  After “every contact visit with a person from\noutside the facility,” the pretrial detainees were “required to\nexpose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a\nstrip search”: if male, “he must lift his genitals and bend over to\nspread his buttocks for visual inspection[,]” if female, “vaginal\nand anal cavities . . . are visually inspected.” Id. at 558 & n.39.\nThe district court had ruled that body-cavity searches were\npermissible only upon a contemporaneous showing of probable\ncause to believe the inmate is concealing contraband.  See\nUnited States ex rel. Wolfish v. Levi, 439 F. Supp. 114, 148\n(S.D.N.Y. 1977). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that,\nassuming pretrial detainees “retain some Fourth Amendment\nrights  upon  commitment  to  a  corrections  facility,”  Bell  v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 558, there are circumstances in which a\nstrip search can be conducted “on less than probable cause,”\nwithout clarifying what the standard actually is, id. at 560.\nAlthough stating that “[a]dmittedly, this practice instinctively\ngives  us  the  most  pause,”  the  Court  held  that  “under  the\ncircumstances,  we  do  not  believe  that  these  searches  are\nunreasonable.” Id. at 558.  The Court noted with regard to the\npretrial detainees that “[u]nder the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3146, a person in the federal system is committed [by a\njudicial officer after a hearing] to a detention facility only\nbecause no other less drastic means can reasonably ensure his\npresence at trial.” Id. at 524; see 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).  The\nCourt further observed that “[a] detention facility is a unique\nplace fraught with serious security dangers,” Bell, 441 U.S. at\n559, noting that “[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons, and\nother contraband is all too common an occurrence,” id.\nIn Bell the Court stated that the “test of reasonableness\nunder the Fourth Amendment” is “a balancing of the need for\nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights that\n\n6\nthe search entails.”  Id. at 559.  It reasoned that “maintaining\ninstitutional  security  and  preserving  internal  order  and\ndiscipline are essential goals that may require limitation or\nretraction of the retained constitutional rights of both convicted\nprisoners  and  pretrial  detainees,”  and  that  infringement  of\nconstitutional guarantees “must be evaluated in the light of the\ncentral  objective  of  prison  administration,  safeguarding\ninstitutional security.”  Id. at 546–47.  Concluding both that “[a]\ndetention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security\ndangers,”id.at 559 (emphasis added), and that “[t]he searches\nmust be conducted in a reasonable manner,” id. at 560, the\nCourt emphasized that it was addressing only one question as to\nthe committed pretrial detainees:  “whether visual body-cavity\ninspections as contemplated by the [detention facility’s] rules\ncan ever  be  conducted  on  less  than  probable  cause.”  Id.\n(emphasis in the original).  Upon “[b]alancing the significant\nand legitimate security interests of the institution against the\nprivacy interests of the inmates,” the Court “conclude[d] that\nthey can.” Id.\nThe  question  remaining  after  Bell was  whether  strip\nsearches of individuals arrested for non-violent minor offenses\nwho are not committed to a detention facility to await trial are\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment in the absence of\nreasonable  suspicion  the  arrestee  is  hiding  contraband  or\nweapons.  Lower courts applied Bell’s balancing test, noting that\nthe Supreme Court had approved strip searches of pretrial\ndetainees only where objective circumstances indicated they\nwere  needed  to  maintain  institutional  security,  and  not  as\nvalidating  a  blanket  policy  of  strip  searching  all  pretrial\ndetainees.  See, e.g., Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253\n(6th Cir. 1989);  Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d\n1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).  The Fourth Circuit, in holding\nunconstitutional strip searches of arrestees who would not be\nintermingled with the general jail population and were accused\n\n7\nof crimes not associated with concealing contraband,  identified\nfour factors that weighed against strip searching: (1) the plaintiff\nwould not be intermingled with the general jail population; (2)\nthe offense was not one usually associated with possession of\nweapons or contraband; (3) there was no cause to believe the\nparticular detainee might possess either; and (4) when the search\nwas conducted the plaintiff had been at the detention center for\none and one-half hours “without even a pat-down search.”\nLogan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981), cert.\ndenied sub nom.Clements v. Logan, 455 U.S. 942 (1982).  The\nfollowing  year  the  Seventh  Circuit  rejected  strip  search\ndistinctions between male and female arrestees as a denial of\nequal protection, stating that the City of Chicago had “failed to\nshow that men and women minor offenders are not similarly\nsituated,” Mary  Beth  G.,  723  F.2d  at  1274  (emphasis  in\noriginal), and concluding that a strip search of misdemeanor\narrestees in City lockups while awaiting arrival of bail money\nwas  impermissible  absent  “a  reasonable  suspicion  by  the\nauthorities that either of the twin dangers of concealing weapons\nor contraband existed,” id. at 1273.  The Ninth and Tenth\nCircuits adopted a similar approach in balancing the interests\nidentified in Bell, and  concluded that intermingling with other\narrestees or detainees did not necessarily justify strip searches. \nSee Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 618–19 (9th Cir. 1984),\ncert. denied, 471 U.S. 1053 (1985), overruled on other grounds\nby, Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.\n1999) (en banc);  Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th Cir.\n1984).  The Second Circuit in Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d\nCir. 1986), adopted an analysis like that of the Fourth Circuit, id.\nat 801–02, and noted the ten like opinions from seven circuit\ncourts of appeals, id.at 801, in rejecting as too broad a reading\nof Bell that “suggest[s], much less require[s]” strip searches of\nall arrested persons held at a jail in the interest of institutional\nsecurity, id. at 801.  The Sixth Circuit, in view of its precedent\n\n8\nand that of other circuit courts of appeals, concluded, in 1989,\nthat:\nit  was  clearly  established  in  October  1986  that\nauthorities may not strip search persons arrested for\ntraffic violations and nonviolent minor offenses solely\nbecause such persons ultimately will intermingle with\nthe general population at a jail when there were no\ncircumstances to support a reasonable belief that the\ndetainee will carry weapons or other contraband into\nthe jail.  It is objectively reasonable to conduct a strip\nsearch of one charged with a crime of violence before\nthat person comes into contact with other inmates.\nThere is an obvious threat to institutional security.\nMasters, 872 F.2d at 1255. Thus, prior to 2002 all ten of the\ncircuit courts of appeal to address the open question from Bell\nheld  that  strip  searches  of  arrestees  for  non-violent  minor\noffenses  in  the  absence  of  reasonable  suspicion  were\nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\nB.\nAs the district court found, and the majority does not\ndispute, Maj. Op. at 8 n.*, “[u]ntil 2008, every federal circuit\ncourt of appeals to have addressed the issue (ten out of twelve)\nruled that, under Bell, suspicionless strip searches of pre-trial\narrestees  charged  with  non-violent  minor  offenses  was\nunreasonable and thus unconstitutional.”  Bame v. Dillard, 647\nF. Supp. 2d 43, 51 (D.D.C. 2009).  The district court cited:\nWilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir. 2001); Swain v.\nSpinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997); Masters, 872 F.2d at\n1250 (6th Cir.); Weber, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.); Stewart v.\nLubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156 (5th Cir. 1985); Jones v.\nEdwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985) ; Giles, 746 F.2d at\n616–18 (9th Cir.); Hill, 735 F.2d at 394 (10th Cir.); Mary Beth\n\n9\nG., 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.); and Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (4th\nCir.).  Each of these  circuit courts of appeals held either that\nreasonable suspicion was required regardless of whether the\narrestee was intermingled with other arrestees or that reasonable\nsuspicion was required when the arrestee did not so intermingle. \n“In other words, at the time of the searches at issue here\n(September 2002), all these courts, some for nearly twenty-five\nyears, required at least reasonable suspicion to strip search a\npre-trial or pre-arraignment arrestee charged with a non-violent,\nnon-drug crime.”  Bame, 647 F. Supp. 2d at 51.\nThe law in the District of Columbia as of 2002 reflected the\nconsensus of the circuit courts of appeal.  In 1982, in a case\npending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\ninvolving female protesters, the District government entered into\na memorandum of agreement that strip and squat searches of\nfemales  arrested  for  non-violent  misdemeanors  could  be\nconducted only where there is reasonable suspicion the arrestee\nis carrying a weapon, contraband, or evidence that officers\nreasonably believe can only be discovered by a strip or squat\nsearch or, in some circumstances, when the arrestee is going to\nbe placed in the general inmate population.  Morgan v. District\nof Columbia, No. 81-1419 (D.D.C. July 22, 1981); see Bame,\n647 F. Supp. 2d at 47.  Although Marshal Dillard argues that the\nMorgan agreement concerned only female arrestees and did not\nbind him, the district court noted that it bound the District of\nColumbia and that Marshal Dillard was familiar with it, Bame,\n647 F. Supp. 2d at 47 (citing depositions of Marshal Dillard and\nhis Deputy).  Marshal Dillard concedes that a case applying the\nMorgan agreement, Morgan v. Barry, 596 F. Supp. 897, 899\n(D.D.C. 1984), required reasonable individualized suspicion\nbefore permitting the challenged strip search procedure.  \nAdditionally, the settlement in Helton v. United States, 191\nF. Supp. 2d 179, 185 (D.D.C. 2002), put the Marshals Service in\n\n10\nthe District of Columbia directly on notice six months before the\nchallenged  strip searches that they were unconstitutional absent\nindividualized reasonable suspicion.  Although Heltoninvolved\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act and District of Columbia tort law\nrather than the Fourth Amendment, the Constitutional issue was\ndirectly implicated because the government argued that plaintiffs\n(who were anti-fur protesters at a Neiman Marcus department\nstore) were required to prove that the strip and squat search\nordered by the U.S. Marshals Service was unconstitutional in\norder to prevail on their intrusion-upon-seclusion tort claim. \nThe district court ruled that plaintiffs had adequately alleged a\nConstitutional violation by the U.S. Marshals Service to the\nextent doing so was required to prevail on the non-constitutional\ntort claim, noting the “wealth of case law” requiring reasonable\nsuspicion:\nAlthough almost every federal court of appeals has\nruled that strip searches of individuals arrested for\nnonviolent  misdemeanors  or  other  minor  offenses\nviolate  the  Fourth  Amendment  absent  “reasonable\nsuspicion,” this Circuit has yet to address the issue. The\nDistrict Court reached the issue in Doe v. Berberich,\n704 F. Supp. 269 (D.D.C. 1988). . . . The court’s\ncentral holding is in line with virtually every other\ndecision on this issue: “[t]here must be reasonable\nsuspicion that the category of offenders subject to strip\nsearches might possess weapons or contraband.”  Id. at\n271.  The court then held that the strip searches were\nconstitutional even though plaintiffs were charged only\nwith misdemeanors, because the police had complied\nwith  governing  regulations  and  had  reasonable\nsuspicion  to  believe  plaintiffs  were  concealing\ncontraband or drugs, given the nature of the offense of\npossession of a controlled substance. Id. at 272.\n\n11\nHelton, 191 F. Supp. 2d at 185.  In Doe v. Berberich, the district\ncourt  noted  precedent  rejecting  different  strip  search\nrequirements for female and male arrestees.  704 F. Supp. at 271\n(citingMary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.\n1983)).\nReflecting this state of the law, the United States Marshals\nService Policy issued in July 1999 instructed that members of\nthe Marshals Service were authorized to conduct strip searches\n“when there is reasonable suspicion that the prisoner may be (a)\ncarrying contraband and/or weapons, or (b) considered to be a\nsecurity, escape, and/or suicide risk.”2  USMS Policy 99-25 at 3. \nThe  Policy  made  no  distinction  between  male  and  female\narrestees, and it included a non-exclusive list of six criteria on\nwhich to base reasonable suspicion.3\n2  Marshal Dillard has not claimed that the plaintiffs presented\nindividualized security, escape, and/or suicide risks.\n3 The Policy listed six non-exclusive criteria, one or more of\nwhich may provide the basis for concluding reasonable suspicion\nexists:\na. Serious nature of the offense(s) charged, i.e., whether crime\nof violence or drugs;\nb. Prisoner’s appearance or demeanor;\nc.  Circumstances  surrounding  the  prisoner’s  arrest  or\ndetention[,] i.e., whether the prisoner has been convicted or is\na pretrial detainee;\nd. Prisoner’s criminal history;\ne. Type and security level of institution in which the prisoner\nis detained; or\nf. History and discovery of contraband and/or weapons, either\non the prisoner individually or in the institution in which the\nprisoners are detained.\n\n12\nThe district court found that Marshal Dillard and his Deputy\n“received  annual  training  on  the  constitutional  and  legal\nstandards in regard to searches and strip searches,” Bame, 647\nF. Supp. 2dat 47 (citing depositions of Marshal Dillard and his\nDeputy), in addition to being  familiar with then-recent litigation\nin the District of Columbia challenging strip searches of female\nprotesters, id.  Further, the district court found that Marshal\nDillard did “not seriously contend that no justification was\nrequired for the [‘Drop, Squat, and Cough’ strip] search,” but\nsimply “did not develop any justification for strip searching the\nprotester-arrestees, despite the balancing called for in the USMS\nPolicy dating back to 1999.” Bame, 647 F. Supp. 2d at 51–52;\nsee id. at 46.\nAccording to Marshal Dillard, in September 2002 the policy\nin the District of Columbia was to perform drop-squat-and-\ncough strip searches of all persons in Marshals Service custody\nwho came into the Superior Court cell block.  See Dillard\nDeposition at 23 (May 29, 2008).  This policy applied, as the\nplaintiffs’  experiences  show,  even  to  those  who  had  been\narrested for non-violent minor offenses where extensive pat-\ndowns of clothed arrestees and a magnetometer metal detector\nrevealed no contraband or weapons, and the arrestees were not\nto  be  intermingled  with  other  arrestees  and  had  not  been\narraigned or committed to a detention facility to await trial.  The\ndistrict court ruled that the blanket policy violated the national\nUSMS Policy 99-25 and that in view of the post-Bell case law\nconsensus, the blanket policy and the strip searches of the\nplaintiffs were unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  Id.\nat 51–52; see id. at 47–48.\nUSMS Policy 99-25 at 3. \n\n13\nII.\nMarshal Dillard’s position on appeal, that because Bell\nallowed strip searches in some circumstances and there was no\ncase  law  to  the  contrary  addressing  exactly  the  same\ncircumstances  as  in  the  instant  case,  the  challenged  strip\nsearches could not be considered clearly unconstitutional, is\nwithout merit as a matter of Supreme Court precedent, Court of\nAppeals precedent, and local District Court precedent.  See\nHarlow, 457 U.S. at 818 n.32; supra Part I.  Indeed he goes so\nfar as to contend that, contrary to “a consensus of cases of\npersuasive authority,” Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. at 617, the U.S.\nMarshals Service was free to conclude that strip searches in the\nabsence  of  individualized  articulable  suspicion  were\nconstitutional if a District of Columbia appellate court or the\nSupreme Court had not addressed the issue.  See Appellant’s Br.\nat 28–29.  The majority’s analysis is no less troubling inasmuch\nas it confuses the roles of the court and the public official under\nqualified immunity analysis.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly\nrejected the notion that a “reasonably competent public official,”\nHarlow, 457 U.S. at 819, would not be bound to know the\n“consensus of persuasive authority” from other circuits much\nless his own district court by concluding that plaintiffs may\nbring to the court either “cases of controlling authority in their\njurisdiction at the time of the incident which clearly established\nthe rule on which they seek to rely, [ ]or . . . a consensus of cases\nof persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer could not\nhave believed that his actions were lawful,” Wilson v. Layne,\n526 U.S. at 617; see Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 823.\nA.\nStrip searches, as Bell makes clear and the district court\nacknowledged,  must  balance  strong  institutional  security\nconcerns of a detention facility and deference to prison officials\nagainst the Fourth Amendment’s protections.  Bame, 647 F.\n\n14\nSupp. 2d at 52 (citing Allison v. GEO Group, Inc., 611 F. Supp.\n2d 433, 462 (E.D. Pa. 2009)); see Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 560. \nNot once, before or after 2002, has a circuit court of appeals, or\nthe Supreme Court, held that pre-arraignment arrestees for non-\nviolent minor offenses who are held apart from other arrestees\nand  pretrial  detainees  may  be  strip  searched  on  less  than\nreasonable  suspicion  that  they  are  hiding  contraband  or\nweapons.  More recent cases include Jimenez v. Wood Cnty.,\n621 F.3d 372 (5th Cir. 2010); Sterns v. Clarkson, 615 F.3d 1278\n(10th Cir 2010); Archuleta v. Wagner, 523 F.3d 1278, 1282,\n1286 (10th Cir. 2008); and Campbell v. Miller, 499 F.3d 711,\n718 (7th Cir. 2007). The recent decision of the Third Circuit in\nFlorence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of\nBurlington, 621 F.3d 296 (3d Cir. 2010) (decided after briefing\nin the instant case), also does not upset the appellate courts’\nconsensus, for the only question presented was “whether it is\nconstitutional  for  jails  to  strip  search  arrestees  upon  their\nadmission to the general population,” id. at 298 .  Marshal\nDillard’s attempt to distinguish the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in\nGiles, 746 F.2d at 617 — which held unconstitutional strip\nsearches without reasonable suspicion that an individual arrested\nfor a minor traffic offense possessed a weapon or contraband —\nas  involving  a  jail  that  historically  had  experienced  fewer\ncontraband problems than the D.C. Superior Court cell block,\nignores that the arrestee in Giles was placed in the general jail\npopulation, 746 F.2d at 616.   And he apparently ignores that the\napproach adopted by the Supreme Court in Harlow and its\nprogeny, focusing on whether at the time of a public official’s\nchallenged conduct a “doctrine had gained acceptance in the\nlower courts,” Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 822 (even if his “own\nFederal Circuit had not yet ruled,” id. at 823), protects officials\nwho abide by that consensus from incurring liability for their\nconduct,see id. at 823. \n\n15\nMarshal Dillard’s reliance on post-2002 decisions is doubly\nflawed. Under Supreme Court qualified immunity precedent,\ncircuit court of appeals decisions since the strip searches at issue\nin 2002 have no bearing on whether he is entitled to qualified\nimmunity on the ground that there was no clearly established\nlaw to be followed in 2002.  See Pearson, 129 S.Ct. at 823;\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. at 617; Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818.  But\ntaken on their own merit the post-2002 cases are distinguishable\non their facts and do not demonstrate that the law was unsettled\nin  2002,  much  less  after.  The  Eleventh  Circuit’s  en  banc\nreconsideration of Bell in Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th\nCir. 2008), involved strip searches of “all arrestees as part of the\nprocess  of  booking  them  into  the  general  population  of  a\ndetention facility,” id. at 1300, and the holding was limited to\ngeneral population detainees, notwithstanding some of its more\nsweeping language suggesting broader applicability.  See id. at\n1300,  1314.  Similarly,  the  Ninth  Circuit’s  2010  en  banc\nreconsideration of Bell was explicit in stating that although it\nwas upholding against a Fourth Amendment facial challenge a\npolicy allowing strip searches of all pre-arraignment arrestees\nintroduced into the general jail population for custodial housing, \n“[w]e do not, however, disturb our prior opinions considering\nsearches of arrestees who were not classified for housing in the\ngeneral jail or prison population” and that “[t]he strip search\npolicy at issue in this case, and our holding today, applies only\nto detainees classified to enter the general corrections facility\npopulation.”  Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d\n964, 981 & n.17 (9th Cir. 2010).  It is clear from this language\nthat the Ninth Circuit sitting en banc in Bull took pains not to\ndisturb the well-settled case law requiring reasonable suspicion\nto strip search arrestees who are not placed in the general jail\npopulation.  Moreover, distinguishable as these cases are, it\nbears noting that it required decisions by the en banc courts to\nrevisitBell, suggesting that absent en banc review the issue was\nclearly established in those circuits\n\n16\nMarshal Dillard’s response, relying on Evans v. Stephens,\n407 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir. 2005), Savard v. Rhode Island, 338\nF.3d 23, 31–33 (1st Cir. 2003), and Oxley v. Penobscot County,\n714 F. Supp. 2d 180 (D. Me. 2010), does not advance his cause. \nIn Evans,  407  F.3d  at  1278–79,  the  Eleventh  Circuit\ndistinguishedBell because the strip search was conducted by the\narresting officer for the purpose of obtaining evidence, and not\nin order to prevent contraband from entering the general jail\npopulation.  And, in any event, the court denied qualified\nimmunity despite the absence of Supreme Court precedent\nexplicitly addressing the standard to be applied.  Id. at 1279,\n1283.  In Savard, 338 F.3d at 26, 31–33, the First Circuit\nallowed strip searches of misdemeanor arrestees who had not\ngenerally been searched before and were intermingled with\nviolent  offenders  at  the  maximum  security  prison,  as\ndistinguished from a local jail or police station, which the court\nconcluded was dispositive.  In Oxley, 714 F. Supp. 2d at 181 &\nn.3, the Maine district court did not reach the Constitutional\nquestion, instead affirming a magistrate judge’s recommendation\nof qualified immunity for an officer conducting a strip search\nwho  incorrectly  but  reasonably  believed  there  was  a  valid\nreasonable articulable suspicion that the plaintiff was carrying\ncontraband, because the plaintiff failed timely to object to the\ngrant of summary judgment.  See alsoid. at 184 n.4. Given that\nthe district court’s interpretation of Bell in Oxley is diametrically\nopposed to that of Marshal Dillard, id. at 183–86, it is unclear\nhow he has concluded the case could help his cause. \nIn sum, Marshal Dillard’s reference to a circuit split on\ncertain strip search law questions is unpersuasive for purposes\nof qualified immunity because there was not a split in 2002.  His\ncontention that “[a]lthough only the law that existed before\nSeptember 2002 can be relied upon to establish its clarity in\n2002, the reasonablenessof [his] conduct is properly analyzed\nconsidering the application of cases more recent than 2002,”\n\n17\nReply Br. 21, fails for at least two reasons.  First, it ignores\nSupreme  Court  precedent  that,  in  order  to  secure  Fourth\nAmendment  protections,  “a  reasonably  competent  public\nofficial” must “know the law governing his conduct” and “that\ncertain conduct would violate statutory or constitutional rights,”\nHarlow, 457 U.S. at 819.   A decrease in clarity of the law after\n2002 would not make a strip search in 2002 more reasonable. \nSecond, none of the cases cited by Marshal Dillard upset the\nconsensus of circuit courts of appeals “that authorities may not\nstrip search persons arrested for . . .  nonviolent minor offenses\nsolely because such persons ultimately will intermingle with the\ngeneral population at a jail when there were no circumstances to\nsupport a reasonable belief that the detainee will carry weapons\nor other contraband into the jail.”  Masters, 872 F.2d at 1255,\nquoted supra page 8.  His suggestion that the number of cases\ndiscussing strip searches indicates that the law is uncertain also\nis unpersuasive because the cases reach the same result.  Indeed,\nas a further indication of this stability, most recently (after briefs\nin this case had been filed) the Tenth Circuit in Stearns v.\nClarkson, 615 F.3d 1278 (10th Cir. 2010), held that a sergeant \nwas not entitled to qualified immunity for strip searching an\narrestee at a county jail without reasonable suspicion where the\narrestee  was  not  placed  in  the  general  inmate  population\nalthough the officer who performed the strip search had been\ntold that the arrestee was “‘going around following officers, and\ngoing to their homes, making threats.’” Id. at 1287.  The court\nconcluded  that  the  threats  did  not  supply  “specific  and\narticulable facts” suggesting a reasonable suspicion that the\narrestee was carrying contraband, and the officer’s conduct was\ntherefore  contrary  to  clearly  established  law,  including\ncontrolling circuit precedent. Id.\nTo the extent Marshal Dillard suggests that the national\nUSMS Policy 99-25 allowed a blanket, non-particularized strip\nsearch if an arrestee was entering a facility with a history of\n\n18\nsmuggled contraband, that Policy itself states that strip searches\nmust be based on reasonable suspicion that a prisoner may be\ncarrying contraband or weapons or may be a security risk, and\nthat one factor to consider is the “[h]istory of discovery of\ncontraband and/or weapons, either on the prisoner individually\nor in the institution in which prisoners are detained.”  A blanket\npolicy based solely on the history of contraband discovered at\nthe Superior Court cell block ignores the other factors listed in\nPolicy 99-25, such as the nature of the offense charged, and the\nbalancing  that  Bell  contemplates,  441  U.S.  at  559,  560. \nMoreover, to the extent Marshal Dillard suggests post-2002\nevents are relevant in evaluating the reasonableness of his\nconduct,  a  blanket  policy  is  inconsistent  with  the  revised\nnational  U.S.  Marshals  Service  policy  of  April  23,  2003\nallowing strip searches only upon an individualized finding of\nreasonable suspicion and a supervisor’s approval.\nB.\nThe  majority  opinion  does  not  address  the  specific\nConstitutional right asserted here: the right of an individual\narrested for a non-violent minor offense who, unlike in Bell, is\nawaiting arraignment to be free from a strip search absent\nreasonable suspicion the individual is hiding contraband or\nweapons.  In Wilson v. Layne, however, the Supreme Court\nobserved that “[i]t could plausibly be asserted that any violation\nof the Fourth Amendment is ‘clearly established,’ since it is\nclearly established that the protections of the Fourth Amendment\napply  to  the  actions  of  police.”    526  U.S.  at  615.    As  a\nconsequence, the Court held that “the right allegedly violated\nmust be defined at the appropriate level of specificity before a\ncourt can determine if it was clearly established.”  Id. (citing\nAnderson  v.  Creighton,  483  U.S.  635,  641  (1987)).    It  is\nreasonable, as the district court found, to expect Marshal Dillard\nas “a reasonably competent public official,” Harlow, 457 U.S.\nat 819, to be aware in 2002 of the distinction between the\n\n19\ninstitutional concerns arising from judicially committed pretrial\ndetainees who have had contact visits with persons outside of a\ndetention facility, as in Bell, and those that arise at a courthouse\ncell block with regard to pre-arraignment arrestees for non-\nviolent minor offenses who have been subjected to pat-downs\nand metal magnetometric searches and are not intermingled with\nother arrestees or pretrial detainees, and consequently have no\nopportunity to smuggle contraband and weapons to others and\nthereby threaten institutional security, because the case law\nconsensus made, that distinction.  So does the national U.S.\nMarshals Service Policy.\nInstead, the majority, by eliding this distinction leaves any\nright so broadly defined that it could plausibly be asserted that\nno violation of the Fourth Amendment is “clearly established”\nabsent an opinion of the Supreme Court or this court addressing\nthe merits of a Fourth Amendment claim in the particular\ncircumstances at issue.  Absent that, according to the majority,\na reasonable public official ignores the consensus of persuasive \nopinion of the circuit courts of appeals, ignores rulings of the\nfederal  district  court  having  jurisdiction  over  the  official’s\nconduct, ignores the policy of his own agency summarizing the\ncurrent  law,  and  instead  hopes  that  someday  a  court  will\nconclude the prior consensus misapprehended Constitutional\nprotections.  Whereas the Supreme Court has acknowledged that\n“an official could not reasonably be expected to anticipate\nsubsequent legal developments,” Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818, the\nmajority would, in effect, allow a public official to invoke\nqualified immunity upon stating: “I reasonably anticipated that\nthe courts would revise their opinions.”  It matters not, or so it\nappears if the public official’s attempt at clairvoyance is deemed\nreasonable by a court, whether the official’s vatic utterance\ncomes to fruition.  See Maj. Op. at 10-12.  Yet the point\nunderscored by Harlow and its progeny in adopting an objective\nstandard is to ensure the protection of Constitutional rights by\n\n20\nlimiting qualified immunity claims to those based on the law as\na “reasonably competent public official” would understand it at\nthe time of his challenged action.  Otherwise qualified immunity\nas the majority defines it leaves the protection of individual\nConstitutional rights to the subjective interpretation of public\nofficials.\nMost notably, in deciding whether for purposes of qualified\nimmunity the law was clearly established in 2002, the majority\nfails to distinguish, as established by Harlow and its progeny,\nbetween the role of the court to determine whether the law is\n“clearly  established”  at  the  time  of  the  public  official’s\nchallenged conduct, and the role of the public official to know\nand  conform  his  conduct  to  controlling  case  law  in  his\njurisdiction, or if none, to the consensus of cases of persuasive\nauthority of which a reasonably competent public official should\nbe  aware.    In  allowing  Marshal  Dillard  to  claim  qualified\nimmunity based on post-2002 circuit court of appeals decisions,\nthe  majority  returns  to  the  pre-Harlow  subjective  standard\nwhereby a public official is empowered to read a Supreme Court\ndecision on the Fourth Amendment (Bell) as being conclusive on\nthe  constitutionality  of  strip  searches  of  pre-arraignment\narrestees such as the plaintiffs despite the clearly established\nconsensus among the other circuit courts of appeals and district\ncourt opinions in the official’s circuit.  As the Supreme Court\nhas adhered to the objective standard adopted in Harlow, the\npublic official has no such authority.  Although this court has\nauthority to read Bell differently than other circuits, Marshal\nDillard can point to no case law that would allow him to make\nthat determination, and the majority understandably does not\naddress the cases he cites — Evans,Savard and Oxley — as they\noffer no support for the view that the consensus was weak or\nbreaking up, see supra Part II.A\n\n21\nThe majority misses the point in its discussion of how the \nten circuit courts of appeals had interpreted Bell as of 2002.\nFirst, for purpose of claiming qualified immunity the Supreme\nCourt has already advised public officials of the standard to\nwhich they must conform their conduct: clearly established law\nas evidenced by a consensus of persuasive authority at the time\nof their conduct.  Of course, had the Supreme Court held, or\nwere  this  court  to  hold,  that  the  challenged  conduct  is\nConstitutionally permissible, which the majority does not hold,\nthen  the  plaintiffs  would  have  no  Bivens  claim:  “If  no\nconstitutional  right  would  have  been  violated  were  the\nallegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries\nconcerning qualified immunity.”  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194,\n201 (2001).  But the subjective belief of a public official about\nthe law is not the test.  But see Maj. Op. at 10-12.  Second,\nbecause Bell involved judicially committed pretrial detainees\nwho had contacts with persons outside of the facility while\nhoused in a “unique” detention facility with convicted prisoners,\nthe Court’s particular balancing of “the circumstances,” Bell,\n441 U.S. at 558, is of limited relevance.  The question left open\nin Bell was answered for Marshal Dillard before September\n2002 by a consensus of persuasive authority from the circuit\ncourts of appeals and controlling authority from the federal\ndistrict court having jurisdiction over his conduct. These courts,\nupon applying Bell’s balancing test, had uniformly held that the\nFourth Amendment protects pre-arraignment arrestees who like\nthe plaintiffs were arrested for  non-violent minor offenses from\nstrip searches absent reasonable individualized suspicion of\nhiding contraband or weapons.\nAdditionally, the majority concludes, erroneously, that the\nen banc decisions of the Eleventh and Ninth Circuits in Powell\nandBull rejected the prior consensus reading of Bell as regards\npre-arraignment arrestees such as the plaintiffs and conflates this\nrejection with a determination that those circuits more recently\n\n22\ndid not see Fourth Amendment law as clearly established in\n2002.  The majority then uses this mistaken reading of Powell\nand Bull to  conclude  that  Marshal  Dillard  was  likewise\nempowered to interpret the law as unsettled in 2002.  See Maj.\nOp. at 10-12. The Eleventh and Ninth Circuits have the authority\nto change clearly established law upon rehearing en banc, but\nunder Supreme Court precedent Marshal Dillard had no such\nauthority to ignore clearly established law.  Even if the post-\n2002 en banc decisions in Powell and Bull were relevant in\ndetermining clearly established law in 2002, which they are not,\nthose holdings are limited to situations in which arrestees are\nintermingled  with  the  general  jail  population  and  present\ninstitutional security concerns, and thus are distinguishable from\nthe Constitutional right at issue here.\nAs troubling as the majority’s low opinion is of what “a\nreasonably competent public official” ought to know of the law\nunder Harlow  and  its  progeny,  more  troubling  are  the\nimplications  of  the  majority  opinion  for  the  protection  of\nConstitutional rights.  Applying the analysis established by the\nSupreme Court for determining when a public official may\nassert qualified immunity has consequences generally, including\nfor peaceful protesters who come to the Nation’s Capital to\nexercise their First Amendment rights, as well as for any person\narrested for  non-violent minor offense not usually associated\nwith weapons or contraband.  Because Constitutional rights are\nat risk, the Supreme Court has required that the focus of “a\nreasonably competent public official” be on the law as it was\nclearly established at the time of his conduct and not on his\nsubjective  hope  that  the  then-settled  legal  consensus  may\nchange.  The Supreme Court aimed to protect Constitutional\nrights by limiting the availability of qualified immunity to those\nofficials who learn the law as it stands before they act and then\nact in accordance with that law, not those who apply their\nsubjective views instead.  Otherwise, although public officials\n\n23\nwill  not  obviously  be  excused  from  “outrageous  conduct\nobviously . . .  unconstitutional,” Redding, 129 S. Ct. at 2643,\nthey may, the Supreme Court foresaw, be excused from liability\nfor unconstitutional  “action less than outrageous,” id., as where\na court finds “the law” anew prior to the conclusion of a\nplaintiff’s litigation.  The majority’s approach means there are\nno objective limits to the scope of qualified immunity because\na  court  may  one  day  hold  that  the  settled  consensus  of\npersuasive authority misapprehended a Supreme Court opinion\non the requirements of the Constitution.  Although the analytical\napproach  that  “the  law”  is  there  to  be  found  may  have\njurisprudential validity in some contexts, see Maj. Op. at 10-11\n(citing 1 WILLIAMBLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *70–71), but\nsee  Sosa  v.  Alvarez-Machain,  542  U.S.  692,  725  (2004)\n(acknowledging that “there is a general understanding that the\nlaw is not so much found or discovered as it is either made or\ncreated”) (citing Black and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v.\nBrown and Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U.S. 518, 533\n(1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting)), it is inapposite under Supreme\nCourt precedent on qualified immunity. \n  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.",
