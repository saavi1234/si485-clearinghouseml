MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nBULLITT COUNTY, KENTUCKY, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.\n* * * * * * * * * * *\nThis matter is before the court upon a joint motion for preliminary approval of\nthe settlement agreement (DE 40).  The court, having reviewed the record and\nheard from counsel for the parties, and being otherwise sufficiently advised, will\ncertify the matter as a class action for settlement purposes and preliminarily\napprove the settlement agreement.\nI.  Procedural History\nOn March 2, 2005, Kimberly Miracle filed this action in her individual\ncapacity and on behalf of all others similarly situated, alleging that the defendants\nviolated her constitutional rights.   An amended complaint dated October 24, 2007,\nnamed additional plaintiffs in their individual capacities and on behalf of all others\nsimilarly situated.  The representative plaintiffs thus include: Kimberly Miracle,\nJeffrey Fleenor, Richard Daily, April Griffith, Keith Wilson and Earl Taylor.  The\ncomplaint states that the defendants required members of the class to remove their\nclothing for a visual inspection of their bodies when arrested for non-violent minor\noffenses, even though there existed no reasonable suspicion that they were\n\ncarrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  The plaintiffs, individually and on\nbehalf of all others similarly situated, seek damages under the Civil Rights Act of\n1871, 42 U.S.C. ยง1983, for violations of the rights, privileges and immunities\nguaranteed them by the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe United States Constitution.  \nThis matter is brought as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 23 sets forth certain requirements for the\ncertification of a class action, and requires that any dismissal or compromise of the\naction must be approved by the court.  The court must take the following steps to\napprove a class-action settlement: 1) preliminarily approve the proposed settlement,\n2) direct that all interested persons are given notice, and 3) hold a hearing to\ndetermine whether the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  See\nWilliams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 920-21 (6th Cir. 1983).  The court held a\nhearing on July 31, 2008, regarding the grounds for certification of the class and to\naddress certain issues surrounding the preliminary approval of the settlement.  At\nthe hearing, the court certified the matter as a class action and preliminarily\napproved the settlement agreement, stating that this written opinion would follow. \nThe court will now certify the class for settlement purposes, preliminarily approve\nthe proposed settlement agreement, direct the parties to file the proposed notice\nwith the court for its approval, and schedule the fairness hearing.\n2\n\nII.  Certification of Class Action\nThe partiesโ proposed settlement agreement contemplates that the court\ncertify a class with the following definition: โa class consisting of all persons who\nwere arrested for any qualifying non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor offense,\nand were strip-searched at the Bullitt County Detention Center (โthe Jailโ) from\nMarch 2, 2004, to the present, when there existed no basis for a reasonable,\nindividualized suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or\ncontraband.โ1\nThe party moving to certify the class has the burden of proving that class\ncertification is appropriate.  In re American Medical Systems, Inc., 75 F.3d 1069\n(6th Cir. 1996) (hereinafter โAMSโ). In support of certification, the plaintiffs cite\nnumerous cases where โsubstantially similarโ classes were certified based on the\nrequirements of Rule 23. See DE 44, at 3-4.  However, the court must conduct a\nโrigorous analysisโ of the elements of Rule 23 before certifying a class.  Gen. Tel.\nCo. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  The\nrequirements of Rule 23(a) and (b) must be satisfied before a court certifies a class\nfor trial or for settlement-only purposes.  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521\nU.S. 591, 620 (1997).  The standard is heightened when the certification is for the\n1 The language in the settlement agreement is slightly different, but counsel\nfor both parties agreed at the July 31, 2008, hearing that the phrase โall persons\nwho allege that they were arrestedโ should be changed to โall persons who were\narrested.โ  See Settlement Agreement, at 1, attached to the joint motion for\npreliminary approval (DE 40).  \n3\n\npurpose of settlement.  See Intโl Union, United Auto., Aerospace, and Agric.\nImplement Workers of Am. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.3d 615, 625 (6th Cir.\n2007) (citing Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 620).  Rule 23(a) sets forth four\nprerequisites for class certification: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and\nadequacy of representation.  In addition, the plaintiff must show that the proposed\nclass falls into one of the three categories described in Rule 23(b).\n1.  Rule 23(a)\nIn general, the court finds that the parameters of the class definition\nsufficiently limit the class to ensure that all the requirements of Rule 23(a) are\nsatisfied.  The date listed in the definition was chosen based upon Kentuckyโs\nstatute of limitations for personal injury cases, and for 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 cases. \nThus, the March 2, 2004, date is one year before Ms. Miracle filed this action.  \na.  Numerosity\nIn their amended complaint and representations before the court, the\nplaintiffs claim that there are hundreds of potential members in this class.  โThe\nnumerosity requirement requires examination of the specific facts of each case and\nimposes no absolute limitations.โ Gen. Tel. Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330\n(1980).  โWhen class size reaches substantial proportions, however, the\nimpracticability requirement is usually satisfied by the numbers alone.โ    AMS, 75\nF.3d at 1079.  The court finds that the class in this matter is so numerous that\njoinder of all members is impractical.  \n4\n\nIn attempting to identify the class, the parties identified 5,177 people who\ncould potentially fall within the class.  They subsequently mailed questionnaires on\nFebruary 1, 2007, to 5,177 individuals who had been admitted to the jail since the\nMarch 2, 2004, trigger date of the class.  The questionnaires sought information\nfrom the addressees about the charges for which they were arrested and the\nmanner in which they were searched on admission to the jail.2  Responses were\nreceived from 534 of the addressees, a response rate better than ten percent. \nAfter a screening process, during which the questionnaire responses and the\ndefendantsโ jail files were examined, the parties determined that approximately 120\ncomplained of strip-searches under circumstances that fit within the class definition\nand that would show a violation of the constitutional rights of the responders to the\nquestionnaire.  Thus, the parties having identified approximately 120 people who\ncomplained of strip-searches that allegedly violate constitutional rights, the court\nfinds that the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) is satisfied.\nb.  Commonality\nThe court must find that there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  โThe commonality test โis qualitative rather than\nquantitative[;] that is, there need be only a single issue common to all members of\nthe class.โโ AMS, 75 F.3d at 1080 (quoting 1 Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte,\n2 Over 1,600 of those questionnaires were returned undeliverable.  The court\nnotes that it is anticipated that the notice to class members may recapture some of\nthose 1,600 people.  \n5\n\nNewberg on Class Actions, ยง 3.10, at 3-47 (3rd ed. 1992)).  The claims of the\nrepresentative plaintiffs and all other similarly situated are based on the same\nquestions of law or fact, according to the allegations in the amended complaint.  \nThe representative plaintiffs were arrested after March 2, 2004, for non-\nviolent misdemeanor offenses, were taken to the Bullitt County Detention Center,\nand were subjected to visual body cavity searches when the defendants had no\nreasonable, individualized suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons\nor contraband.  The plaintiffs allege that the defendants regularly subject persons\narrested for non-violent minor offenses to the same treatment.  Those strip-\nsearches violate the Constitution and the clearly established law of this circuit.  See\nMasters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989).  The legal theory, that\nthe searches conducted by the defendants pursuant to a blanket policy or custom\nwere unconstitutional, applies to all members of the class.  There are questions\ncommon to each class member, such as whether the defendants had a policy,\nincluding an unwritten policy, to subject persons to strip-searches when those\npersons were in custody for non-violent minor offenses and there was no\nreasonable basis under the law for conducting those strip-searches.  Thus, the\ncourt finds that there are questions of law and fact common to the members of the\nclass.\nc.  Typicality\nThe court must also find that the claims or defenses of the representative\n6\n\nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \nโ[A] plaintiffโs claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course\nof conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members, and if his or her\nclaims are based on the same legal theory.โ  AMS, 75 F.3d at 1083 (quoting 1\nNewberg, supra, ยง 3.13, at 3-76).\nIn this matter the representative plaintiffs and the unnamed members of the\nclass were allegedly arrested for non-violent minor offenses and strip-searched in\nviolation of their constitutional rights.  The amended complaint details the facts\nwith respect to the individually named representatives, including their dates of\narrest, that they were charged with non-violent minor offenses, and that the\ndefendants subjected them to strip-searches without a reasonable basis for doing\nso.  As discussed under the commonality element above, the legal theory under\nwhich the class would proceed is the same for each member, whether a\nrepresentative or unnamed member of the class.  \nAdditionally, the class definition ensures that all class members were at the\nsame jail, during the same period of time, and were arrested for the same kind of\noffenses under circumstances that did not warrant a strip-search.  The narrowing of\nthe class definition ensures that the typicality requirement is satisfied. Thus, the\ncourt finds that the representativesโ claims are typical of the claims of the other\nclass members.\n7\n\nc.  Adequacy of representation\nThe court must find that the representative parties will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class and that they have done so thus far.  There are\ntwo criteria for determining this element: 1) the representatives must have common\ninterests with the unnamed class members, and 2) it must appear that the\nrepresentatives will vigorously prosecute the class action through qualified counsel. \nSenter v. Gen. Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 524-25 (6th Cir. 1976).  \nThe amended complaint satisfies the adequacy requirement by stating that\nthe plaintiffs are members of the class as defined and that their claims are typical\nof the claims of all class members.  Specifically, the plaintiffs state that they were\noffended at the treatment accorded them and the class members, and that they will\naggressively pursue the interests of the entire class.  The amended complaint also\nclaims that the plaintiffsโ interests in obtaining injunctive relief and actual and\npunitive damages for the violations of their constitutional rights and privileges are\nconsistent with, and not antagonistic to, those of any other person within the\nclass.  \nThe court finds that the representatives have common interests with the\nunnamed class members, as discussed under the commonality element above. \nSpecifically, the representatives were subject to the same conduct by the\ndefendants and their claims are based on the same legal theory.  With respect to\nthe vigorous prosecution of the case, Kimberly Miracle originated and pursued this\n8\n\ncase alone for two-and-a-half years.  The other representatives, who were added\nafter the 120 potential claimants were identified, participated, along with Ms.\nMiracle, in two mediations, lengthy meetings and periodic telephone contact with\ncounsel, and then approved the settlement.  Therefore, the representative parties\nhave thus far fairly and adequately protected the interests of the class, and will\ncontinue to do so.\n2.  Rule 23(b)\nThe class must additionally meet one of the three criteria in Rule 23(b). The\ncourt finds that this class meets the criteria in Rule 23(b)(3), which requires that\nโthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any\nquestions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to\nother available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  The court again finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated the\ncommonality of the class membersโ claims and interests.  The parties have not\npresented issues on which the interests of the class members differ and the court\nfinds that their common issues predominate over any such differing interests.3 \n3 The reasonableness of any search is an individualized defense, and thus is\nnot common to all class members.  The court notes that the exact circumstances\nsurrounding the search of each class member may differ, especially with respect to\nwhether the defendants had a reasonable basis for believing that the arrestee was\ncarrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  However, the plaintiffs allege that\nthe defendants were acting under an unwritten policy to search everyone and thus\nnot conducting an individualized assessment to determine whether to conduct a\nstrip-search.  The court also notes that the proposed settlement agreement sets\nforth a mechanism for resolving this question with respect to each individual, and\nthus the common issues among the class are still predominant over this fact-\n9\n\nAdditionally, the court finds that the class definition, narrowly limited as it is,\nensures that this element of Rule 23(b)(3) is satisfied.  \nFurther, a class action is a superior method for resolving the dispute.  A\nmultiplicity of suits, with their consequent burden on the court and the defendants,\nshould be avoided.  It would be nearly impossible for all of the class members to\nintervene as party plaintiffs in this action.  The class action mechanism is an\nefficient and fair way to adjudicate the claims presented here.  Thus, the class\nmeets the Rule 23(b)(3) criteria.\nAccordingly, the court finds that the plaintiffs, in requesting certification of\nthe class for settlement purposes, have satisfied their burden to prove that the\nclass meets the requirements of Rule 23.\nIII.  Preliminary Approval of Settlement Agreement\nThe preliminary approval stage of the litigation requires the court to\ndetermine whether the settlement is preliminarily fair, reasonable, and adequate,\nbut does not require the court to review the merits of the case.  โPreliminary\napproval of a proposed settlement is based upon the courtโs familiarity with the\nissues and evidence, as well as the arms-length nature of the negotiations prior to\nthe proposed settlement, ensuring that the proposed settlement is not illegal or\ncollusive.โ  In re Dun & Bradstreet Credit Servs. Customer Litig., 130 F.R.D. 366,\nspecific defense.  Additionally, considering the method outlined in the settlement\nagreement for resolving this question, including the claimantโs right to appeal a\ndenial based on this defense, the class action remains the most efficient and\neffective manner of resolving the dispute.\n10\n\n370 (S.D. Ohio 1990) (citing cases).  โOnce preliminary approval has been granted,\na class action settlement is presumptively reasonable, and an objecting class\nmember must overcome a heavy burden to prove that the settlement is\nunreasonable.โ  Levell v. Monsanto Research Corp., 191 F.R.D. 543, 550 (S.D.\nOhio 2000) (citing Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 921 (6th Cir. 1983);\nBronson v. Board of Education, 604 F. Supp. 68, 71 (S.D. Ohio 1984)); see also In\nre Dun & Bradstreet, 130 F.R.D. at 370 (citing cases).\nโFairness calls for a comparative analysis of the treatment of class members\nvis-a-vis each other and vis-a-vis similar individuals with similar claims who are not\nin the class.โ Federal Judicial Center, Manual for Complex Litigation 315 (4th ed.\n2004). \nIf the preliminary evaluation of the proposed settlement does not\ndisclose grounds to doubt its fairness or other obvious deficiencies,\nsuch as unduly preferential treatment to class representatives or of\nsegments of the class, or excessive compensation for attorneys, and\nappears to fall within the range of possible approval, the court should\ndirect that notice under Rule 23(e) be given to the class members of a\nformal fairness hearing, at which arguments and evidence may be\npresented in support of and in opposition to the settlement.  \nId. at 236-37.  The court must determine whether the settlement agreement is\nwithin the range of possible approval.\nIn response to the joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement\nagreement, the court requested supplemental briefing4 and scheduled a hearing on\n4 The parties were directed to address the following concerns of the court\nregarding the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement: 1) the\ntreatment of class representatives compared with the treatment of remaining class\n11\n\nthe motion.5  The parties filed a joint response to the courtโs order, addressing each\nof the courtโs concerns in turn.  See DE 44.  At the hearing on July 31, 2008, the\ncourt requested that the parties present further information on only three of the\ntopics because the partiesโ brief sufficiently addressed the other issues.  The three\nissues addressed in further detail at the hearing were 1) the treatment of class\nrepresentatives compared with the treatment of remaining class members; 2) the\nlevel of compensation to the class members, specifically the $1,500 cap; and 3)\nthe provision allowing only one payment per class member no matter how many\ntimes each was allegedly strip-searched.\nCounsel for the parties presented information at the hearing to demonstrate\nmembers; 2) the level of compensation to the class members and whether it is\ninadequate; 3) the provision allowing only one payment per class member no matter\nhow many times they were admitted into the facility and/or searched while\nincarcerated; 4) the total number of potential class members, including the extent\nto which they have been identified; 5) imposing strict eligibility conditions and/or\ncumbersome claims procedures (especially considering that the unclaimed portions\nof the fund will revert to the defendants); 6) reversion of the settlement funds to\nthe defendants; and 7) treatment of class members filing late claims and a possible\nreserve of funds for such late claims.  DE 42.\n5 A hearing should be held prior to the courtโs preliminary approval and\ndetermination of whether the proposed settlement is illegal or tainted with\ncollusion.  Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 921 (6th Cir. 1983); Bronson v.\nBoard of Education, 604 F. Supp. 68, 71 (S.D. Ohio 1984).  โReview of a proposed\nclass action settlement generally involves two hearings.  First, counsel submit the\nproposed terms of settlement and the judge makes a preliminary fairness\nevaluation. . . . If the case is presented for both class certification and settlement\napproval, the certification hearing and preliminary fairness evaluation can usually be\ncombined.โ  Federal Judicial Center, Manual for Complex Litigation 320-21 (4th ed.\n2004); see also In re Inter-Op Hip Prosthesis Liability Litigation, 204 F.R.D. 330,\n337-38 (N.D. Ohio 2001). \n12\n\nthe fairness of the proposed settlement.  The court finds, based on the\nrepresentations of counsel, that the twenty-to-one ratio between the award to Ms.\nMiracle and those to the unnamed class members is not a cause for concern.  The\ninformation presented to the court regarding other class-action settlements in strip-\nsearch cases shows that the settlements range from very small to very large and\nthus there is not a good guide for this settlement.  As the first class representative,\nMs. Miracle was the only one subjected to a deposition and other discovery, and\nshe was the subject of the media coverage.  After hearing from the parties, the\ncourt finds nothing unreasonable regarding the settlement payment ratios, and the\ncourt finds that the ratios are fair, reasonable, and adequate.  \nWith regard to the absolute cap on the amount of the settlement payments\nto unnamed class members, the court finds that this is also reasonable based on\nthe representations of the parties.  In this case, unlike some other strip-search class\nactions where settlement payments were larger, there was no written, blanket\npolicy to strip-search every person admitted to the jail, and there were no exigent\ncircumstances.  Thus, the parties would have had to try liability to a jury except for\nthe settlement.  The defendants conducted a mock trial in front of three separate\njuries that all returned verdicts for the defendants.  This uncertainty of the outcome\nof the litigation makes it more reasonable for the plaintiffs to accept the settlement\noffer from the defendants.  Additionally, the plaintiffs referred to the difficult\neconomic times and their belief that it was less of a gamble for the plaintiffs to\n13\n\naccept this amount rather than attempt to get the uncertain amount that may result\nfrom a trial.  Finally, the cap was approved by the class representatives, who found\nit reasonable when they approved the settlement agreement.  \nThe final issue the court requested that the parties address at the hearing\nwas the one-time-award limitation that allows a class member to recover only once,\nregardless of the number of violations.  Counsel for the plaintiffs has experience\nwith these types of actions, including settlements where payments were given for\nmore than one violation.  Based on counselโs representations, providing payments\nfor each instance where a claimantโs rights were violated complicates the\nadministration of the class, increases the expenses of administration, and prolongs\nthe process.  The court agrees, and finds that the advantages of providing a\nprocess for multiple recoveries do not outweigh the prejudice to the class rights\nthat would result from the complications and delay.  \nAfter careful consideration, the court concludes that there are no substantial\ngrounds to doubt the preliminary fairness, reasonableness, or adequacy of the\nproposed settlement agreement, and it will grant preliminary approval.\nAccordingly,\nIT IS ORDERED that this matter is CERTIFIED as a class action for settlement\npurposes. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the partiesโ proposed settlement agreement is\nPRELIMINARILY APPROVED.\n14\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties are DIRECTED to file the proposed\nNotice of Settlement and Settlement Claim Form with the court by August 19,\n2008.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a fairness hearing pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(e)(2) is SCHEDULED for November 17, 2008, at 3:00 p.m.\nSigned on  August 14, 2008\n15",

COMPLAINT \nBULLITT COUNTY, KENTUCKY  DEFENDANTS \nSERVE:  County Judge/Executive \nKenneth Rigdon \n214 Frank E. Simon \nP.O. Box 216 \nShepherdsville, Kentucky 401 65 \nSERVE:  Walt Sholar \n129 Highway 44W \nShepherdsville, Kentucky 40165 \nand \nDANNY FACKLER, in his capacity \nas the BULLITT COUNTY JAILER \n1671 South Preston Highway \nP.O. Box 216 \nShepherdsville, Kentucky 40165 \n* * * * * * * \nI.  Introduction \n1.  Kimberly  Miracle  files  this  action  in  her  individual  capacity  and  on \nbehalf  of  all  persons  arrested  for  minor  offenses  who  were  required  by  the \nDefendants in the Bullitt County Jail (hereinafter \"Jail\") to remove their clothing for \n\na visual inspection on admission to the Jail despite the absence of any reasonable \nsuspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  This class \nof people includes all individuals who were so treated from March 3, 2004 to the \npresent. \n2.  Such  searches have been  and  continue to be  regularly conducted by \nthe  Defendants  and  there  are  hundreds  of  members  of  this  class.  There  are \nquestions  of  law  and  fact  in  this  case  that are  common  to  all  members  of this \nclass.  Plaintiff's claims are typical of those of this respective class, and they will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of this class. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n3.  Plaintiff,  and  all  other  similarly  situated,  seek  actual  and  punitive \ndamages from Defendants under the Civil  Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.  ยง 1983, \nfor  gross  and  unconscionable  violations  of  the  rights,  privileges  and  immunities \nguaranteed them by the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe Constitution of the United States.  Accordingly,  this Court has jurisdiction of \nthis case pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C.  ยง 1331  and  ยง 1343.  Plaintiff and \nthe other members of her class also seek declaratory and  injunctive relief,  as  well \nas  damages  under  the  pendent  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  for  negligence,  gross \nnegligence  and  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress.  As  Bullitt  County, \nKentucky is the residence of all defendant parties to this action and location of all \nacts pertinent to this suit, venue is proper in this Court. \n2 \n\nIII.  Class Action \n4.  Plaintiff brings this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), \n(2)  and  (3)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  The  class  consists  of  all \nindividuals arrested for minor offenses who were required to remove their clothing \nfor  a  visual  inspection  on  admission  to  the  Jail  despite  the  absence  of  any \nreasonable suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. \n5.  Plaintiff  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests  of  all  class \nmembers.  She is a member of the class and her claims are typical of the claims of \nall  class  members.  Plaintiff was offended  at the treatment accorded  her and  the \nclass  members  and  will  aggressively  pursue  the  interests  of  the  entire  class. \nPlaintiff's interest in obtaining injunctive relief and actual and punitive damages for \nthe violations of her constitutional rights and privileges are consistent with and not \nantagonistic of those of any other person within her class. \n6.  Given  the  circumstances  of  her  search,  as  detailed  below,  Plaintiff \nalleges,  on  information  and  belief,  that  Defendants  regularly  require  all  persons \narrested  for  nonviolent  minor  offenses  to  remove  their  clothing  for  a  visual \ninspection  of their  bodies  on  admission to the Jail,  even  though there  exists  no \nreasonable grounds for believing that weapons or contraband have been concealed \nupon  their  persons.  Such  searches  violate  the  Fourth,  Fifth,  Eighth,  Ninth  and \nFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, Title 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983, Bell v.  Wolfish, 441  U.S. 520 (1979) and the clearly established law of this \ncircuit, as set forth in Masters v.  Crouch,  872 F.2d.  1248 (6th Cir.), cert denied, \n3 \n\n493  U.S.  977,  110  S.Ct.  503  (1989).  The  only  question  that  remains  to  be \nresolved  is  whether  Plaintiff  and  the  members  of  the  class  are  entitled  to \ndeclaratory  and  injunctive  relief,  or  to  award  of  compensatory  and  punitive \ndamages and, if so, the extent of such an award. \n7.  A  class  action is  superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy because: \na.  A  multiplicity of suits  with consequent  burden  on \nthe courts and Defendants should be avoided. \nb.  It  would  be  virtually  impossible  for  all  class \nmembers  to  intervene  as  parties-plaintiff  in  this \naction. \nc.  Upon adjudication of Defendants' liability, claims of \nthe  class  members  can  be  determined  by  this \nCourt. \n8.  Plaintiff is a resident of Jefferson County within the Commonwealth of \nKentucky. \n9.  The  Defendant,  Bullitt  County,  at  all  times  mentioned  herein, \nemployed,  was  responsible for the establishment of policies  either formally or by \ncustom  for,  and  was  responsible  for  the  employment,  training,  supervision  and \nconduct of the officers and employees of the Bullitt County Jail. \n10.  The Defendant, Danny Fackler, is Jailer of Bullitt County, and as such, \nestablished  policies  formally  or  by  custom  for,  and  was  responsible  for  the \nemployment,  training,  supervision and  conduct of, the officers and  employees of \nthe Bullitt County Jail. \n4 \n\nV.  Nature of Defendants' Conduct \n11 .  Defendants, individually and in conspiracy with one another, engaged \nin  the conduct described  below under color of the law of the Commonwealth of \nKentucky  and  Bullitt  County.  The  offenses  described  below  resulted  from  the \nfailure of the state and county agencies and individuals to employ qualified persons \nfor positions of authority, and/or to properly or conscientiously train and supervise \nthe  conduct  of  such  persons  after  their  employment,  and/or  to  promulgate \nappropriate  operating  policies  and  procedures  either  formally  or  by  custom  to \nprotect the constitutional rights of the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nDefendants' conduct was intentional or grossly negligent, or indicated active malice \ntoward  Plaintiff and  the  class  or  at  least  a total  and  reckless  disregard  for  and \nindifference to their constitutional and  common law rights, justifying an  award of \npunitive damages  in  addition to the actual damages  which  Plaintiff and  the class \nare entitled to recover. \nVI.  Facts \n12.  The  Plaintiff,  Kimberly  Miracle,  was  arrested  on  March  3,  2004 and \ncharged with violations of various motor vehicle statues, including failure to wear a \nseatbelt,  improper registration plates,  no insurance,  giving a false name to police, \nand  driving  under the  influence  of alcohol,  all  misdemeanor  offenses.  She  was \narrested  and  was taken  to the  Bullitt County Jail.  There,  she  was  taken  into a \nroom where she was told to remove her clothes, bend over, and spread apart her \nbuttocks and cough. \n5 \n\nVII.  The Law and Defendants' Policy \n13.  In  1979, the United States Supreme Court held that a pretrial detainee \nhas  the  right  not to  be  searched  unless the  reasonableness  of such  a search  is \nestablished  by \"balancing ... the need  for the particular search against the invasion \nof personal rights that the search entails.\"  Bell v.  Wolfish, supra at 559 (emphasis \nadded).  On  April  18,  1989,  the  Sixth  Circuit  issued  its  opinion  in  Masters  v. \nCrouch, supra, in which it held: \nIt was clearly established on October 21,  1986 ... that \na  person  charged  with  only  a  traffic  violation  or \nnonviolent minor offense may not  be  subjected  to  a \nstrip-search  unless  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for \nbelieving that the particular person  might be  carrying \nor concealing weapons or other contraband. \nId.  at  1257.  In  this  case,  Plaintiff was  arrested  for  nonviolent minor offenses. \nNeither her behavior nor her background gave Defendants any reasonable grounds \nfor  believing  that  she  might  be  carrying  or  concealing  weapons  or  other \ncontraband.  Under  such  circumstances,  Defendants'  requirement  that  Plaintiff \nexpose the  most private  part of her  physical  person  for  a visual  inspection  was \nunconscionable,  was  an  illegal  strip-search  by any  definition  and  was  a flagrant \nviolation of the balancing requirement of Bell v.  Wolfish, supra. \n6 \n\nVIII.  Causes of Action \nA.  Count I \n14.  Paragraphs  1-1 3 above are incorporated herein by reference and made \nthis Paragraph 14. \n15.  Plaintiff's search, described above, was part of a continuing pattern of \nmisconduct  and  is  the  result  of  statutes,  ordinances,  regulations,  policies, \nprocedures,  customs  and  practices of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and  Bullitt \nCounty,  either written  or unwritten, that are  systematically applied  whenever an \narrestee  is  admitted  to  or  released  from the  Bullitt  County  Jail.  Such  practices \nconstitute an arbitrary use of government power, and evince a total, intentional and \nunreasonable disregard for the constitutional and common law rights of the citizens \nof Kentucky,  including  Plaintiff and the members of the class,  and  the wholesale \nviolations  of  those  rights  likely  to  result  from  the  systematic  pursuit  of  such \npractices. \n16.  As  a  result  of  the  foregoing,  Plaintiff  and  her  class,  through \nDefendants'  intentional  or  grossly  negligent conduct,  were deprived  without  due \nprocess  of  law  of  the  following  rights  and  immunities  guaranteed  them  by  the \nConstitution of the United States in  violation of the Civil  Rights Act of 1871, 42 \nU.S.C.  ยง 1983: \na.  Their  right  to  be  secure  in  their  person  against \nunreasonable  searches  and  seizures  under  the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments; \n7 \n\nb.  Their  right  to  privacy  in  their  person  against \nunreasonable  intrusions  under  the  Fourth,  Fifth, \nNinth and Fourteenth Amendments; \nc.  Their  right  to  the  equal  protection  of  the  Ij;lw \nsecured by the Fourteenth Amendment; and \nd.  Their right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual \npunishment  under  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments. \n17.  Moreover,  given  the  pre-existing  law  that  clearly  prohibited \nDefendants'  conduct,  Defendants'  searches  of  Plaintiff  and  the  members  of her \nclass  were intentional,  wanton and  malicious,  and  were indicative of Defendants' \ntotal and  reckless disregard  of,  indifference to the rights  of,  and  rise  of harm to, \nPlaintiff and the other members of the class. \nB.  Count II \n18.  Paragraphs 1-17 above are incorporated herein by reference and made \nthis Paragraph 18. \n19.  By  virtue  of  the  foregoing,  Defendants,  without  justification, \nnegligently or intentionally inflicted upon Plaintiff and the class severe mental and \nemotional distress. \nC.  Count III \n20.  Paragraphs 1-19 above are incorporated herein by reference and made \nthis Paragraph 20. \n21.  By  virtue  of the  foregoing,  Defendants  were  negligent,  and  grossly \nnegligent, all to the damage of the Plaintiff and the class. \n8 \n\nIX.  Damages \n22.  Paragraphs 1-21  above are incorporated herein by reference and made \nthis Paragraph 22. \n23.  Plaintiff  and  the  members  of  the  class  were  unjustifiably  and \nunconstitutionally  searched  in  a  manner  that  generated  tremendous  and \noverwhelming embarrassment, humiliation, and mental and emotional distress.  As \na  result,  they  have  suffered,  and  are  entitled  to  recover,  actual  damages. \nFurthermore, Defendants' violations of the constitutional and common law rights of \nthe Plaintiff and  the class  were cruel,  malicious  and  evinced  a total  and  reckless \ndisregard  for  and  indifference to those  rights,. entitling  Plaintiff  and  the  class  to \nrecover punitive damages from  Defendants in  order to deter such  conduct in  the \nfuture. \nX.  Declaratory Judgment and Permanent Injunction \n24.  Paragraphs  1-23 above are incorporated herein by reference and made \nthis Paragraph 24. \n25.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY\nLOUISVILLE DIVISION\nCIVIL ACTION NO. 05-130-C\nKIMBERLY MIRACLE, ET AL. PLAINTIFF,\nV. MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nBULLITT COUNTY, KENTUCKY, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.\n* * * * * * * * * * *\nOn November 17, 2008, this Court conducted a Fairness Hearing in order to\nassess whether the settlement reached by the parties in this litigation is fair,\nreasonable, adequate, and should be approved.  Such hearing having been held, the\nCourt finds as follows:\n1.  This settlement was mediated by Judge Tom McDonald, an\nexperienced mediator and former judge who knows the obligations of the Court in\noverseeing class action settlements of this kind.  As a consequence of their\nexperience in prior strip-search class action cases, counsel for the parties had not\nonly a thorough understanding of the law and facts bearing on this litigation, but\nhad researched the likely impact of those facts on a jury were this case not settled.\n2. The settlement in this case was reached only after numerous, private,\narms-length negotiations between the parties, and after two settlement conferences\nmediated by Judge McDonald, in which each side repeatedly argued its position and\nargued the risks the other would bear were the case not settled.  The strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case on both sides were thoroughly researched, explored\nthrough discovery, and argued in settlement.  There is no question but that counsel\nhad sufficient information to arrive at an informed evaluation on which this\nsettlement is based.\n3. This class action covers the period from March 2, 2004 to the\npresent.  Plaintiffs claimed that the Bullitt County Detention Center (\"the Jail\") had\nin place a policy which required that all persons, even persons arrested for minor\noffenses, be strip-searched before their admission to the Jail's general population. \nThe Jail, however, had in place a written policy which Defendants claimed\nprohibited the strip-searches of persons arrested for minor offenses on admission to\nthe Jail unless there existed reasonable grounds for believing that such arrestees\nwere carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  \n4. Liability was thus a vigorously contested issue in this case, unlike prior\nstrip-search class action cases in Kentucky in which the defendants' unlawful\nconduct was actually directed by a written policy of the jail in issue.  It was unclear\nhow many Plaintiffs would be willing to surrender their anonymity and bear the\ninconvenience of testifying at trial about an incident that many might consider\npersonal and embarrassing.  Those that chose to testify would then be presented\nwith the challenge of communicating to the jury their recollection of incidents that\nmay have occurred more than three and one-half years ago.  Were Plaintiffs to\nprevail on the issue of liability, Plaintiffs would likely have then had to endure a\n2\n\nsecond series of trials, in which each Plaintiff's damages would likely be determined\nseparately, and each Plaintiff would be confronted with the challenge of\ncommunicating to the jury the depth of the intangible damages -- the humiliation,\nshame and distress -- they sustained as a consequence of their strip-search.  Even\nwere these damages effectively communicated to the jury, it was likely that jury\nverdicts would vary greatly in amount.  While a jury could award damages in\nexcess of the sum a claimant might receive under this settlement, there was as\ngreat a chance that the jury might award significantly less, particular to those who\nhave a lengthy criminal history.  Throughout the litigation, the question would\nremain whether jurors would be predisposed to believe law enforcement officials\nover other citizens, particularly citizens with a criminal record.  Counsel for\nDefendants were experienced litigators and would continue to provide a vigorous\ndefense against all claims.    \n5. Defendants were unwilling voluntarily to pay more to settle this case. \nPushing on to trial would have significantly delayed Plaintiffs' recovery, if any.  Had\ntrials eventually resulted in even greater total liability for the County, Plaintiffs\nwould have been confronted with the additional delay of appeals, and depending on\nfuture circumstances, the additional risk of recoverability of the judgment.\n6. Class members under the settlement are divided into two groups:  (a)\nthe named class representatives, who surrendered their anonymity and spearheaded\nthis litigation throughout its course; and (b) the unnamed class members.  The\n3\n\nsettlement provides that the named class representatives will divide among\nthemselves the sum of $120,000.00.  Named class representatives, depending\nupon their length in service, will receive between $10,000.00 and $30,000.00\neach.  The parties have previously provided the Court an Excel spreadsheet\nshowing 32 prior strip-search class action settlements.  That spreadsheet shows\nthat amounts typically paid named class representatives, in cases in which it can be\ndetermined, range between $10,000.00 and $25,000.00.   \n7. This is all the named class representatives will receive -- they will not\nbe entitled to any additional payment under the terms of the Settlement Agreement\nproposed to the Court.\n8. Not enough can be said for individual citizens, with no formal legal\ntraining, who believe their constitutional rights have been violated, exercise the\ninitiative of contacting counsel, and then agree to surrender their anonymity and be\nnamed as plaintiffs in a civil rights case that becomes a matter of public record. \nThe named class representatives participated in two mediations of this case,\nnumerous meetings with counsel and periodic contact via telephone.  They have\nhonorably discharged their responsibilities as named class representatives, and each\napproved the settlement that has now been tendered to the Court.\n9. The Court should encourage citizens to make the sacrifices and accept\nthe responsibilities willingly undertaken and faithfully discharged by the named\nclass representatives in this case.  The Court has compared these amounts to\n4\n\nsettlements in comparable cases, and has found them reasonable, particularly given\nthe named class representatives' numerous meetings with counsel and their\nattendance at two separate mediations, the faithful discharge of their duties, and\nthe significance of this case, the uncertainty of its outcome, and the ultimate\nresult.\n10. Unnamed class members with qualifying claims will receive a payment\nnot to exceed $1500 each.  This amount compares very favorably even to\nsettlements in which liability was not an issue.  \n11. Defendants were unwilling to agree to caps any higher than these. \nThe named class representatives had to choose whether to accept such caps, or\nreject such caps, scuttle the settlement, and proceed to trial with all the delay\ninherent in such a process, not to mention the ever-present risk of non-recovery. \nGiven the hard financial realities presently confronting many potential claimants, the\nnamed class representatives decided to accept the caps and tender this settlement\nfor the consideration of the class.  As previously noted, these caps nonetheless\ncompare very favorably even to settlements in which liability was not an issue.  \n12. Class members will only recover for one entry search, even though\nthey may have been subjected to multiple entry searches.  However, allowing class\nmembers to recover for searches following multiple arrests would substantially\ncomplicate and increase the expense of class administration, thus reducing that\nportion of the settlement fund available to pay the claims of unnamed class\n5\n\nmembers.  The Court thus finds this provision of the settlement to be fair and\nreasonable.\n13. Funds will revert to Defendants only if -- after all payments\ncontemplated by the settlement, including the maximum approved claimants can\nreceive under the terms of the settlement -- there remain any funds in the\nsettlement account.  As a consequence, the reversion provision of the proposed\nSettlement Agreement in no way infringes upon the amount, fairness or\nreasonableness of what will be paid to qualified claimants.  Moreover, as with the\nper claim cap, reversion was a non-negotiable condition of settlement for\nDefendants, and reflected a responsible effort on Defendants' part given public\nfunding of the settlement amount. \n14. No amount of the settlement fund will be set aside for late claims. \nEstablishing such a reserve would decrease the sums paid to qualified claimants if\nthe settlement fund would otherwise be exhausted by payment of approved claims. \nIn addition, a reserve would necessarily raise thorny issues of the amount of the\nappropriate set-aside, the appropriate grace period to allow for late claims,\ndisparities in treatment of claimants, and what should be done in the event the\namount set aside is too much or too little.  These issues would unnecessarily\ncomplicate an otherwise straightforward settlement process, and would increase\nclaims administration expense, thus reducing the recovery of approved claimants.\n15. Plaintiffs' counsel are seeking one-third of the settlement fund of\n6\n\n$800,000.00, or $266,666.67, in compensation for their work in this case.  Greg\nBelzley, lead counsel for the class, is an experienced litigator and a partner at\nDinsmore & Shohl LLP.  He first became involved in strip-search litigation with the\nfiling of Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977\n(1989).  He has since been lead counsel for plaintiffs in five strip-search class\nactions, three of which have previously been settled.  This case is one of two\nstrip-search class actions now pending in Kentucky in which Mr. Belzley is lead\ncounsel for Plaintiffs.  Mr. Belzley has argued numerous strip-search appeals before\nthe First and Sixth Circuits, including an en banc proceeding before the First Circuit. \nMr. Belzley is highly experienced in the law, litigation and settlement of strip-search\nclass actions.  Robert Walker is also an experienced litigator, and a partner at\nWalker, Vaughn & Wallace PLLC.  He and Mr. Belzley and their respective firms\nshared the load in this case.  \n16. This Court has observed the conduct of these counsel throughout this\nlitigation.  The record reflects that they have skillfully, effectively and zealously\nadvocated the position of the class throughout these proceedings, and have\nachieved a fair and reasonable result for their clients.  Civil rights and class action\nlitigation both involve complex issues of law and procedure.  Plaintiffs' counsel bore\nall fees and expenses during this litigation, and bore all risk of loss had Plaintiffs not\nprevailed.  The named class representatives each executed contingency fee\nagreements with Plaintiffs' counsel in which they consented to give their counsel as\n7\n\nmuch as 40% of the ultimate recovery.  They have unanimously approved\nPlaintiffs' counsel's request for one-third of the settlement fund as their fee, and\nthe Court finds that such approval was voluntarily given and that the fee is\nreasonable.  \n17. The notice of settlement and claim form were negotiated by the\nparties with input from the Court, and were ultimately approved by the Court.  The\nnotice of settlement is simple and straightforward, as is the proof of claim form. \nThe parties have created a claims process that can be understood and administered\nby the claimants themselves, regardless of their socio-economic or educational\nbackground.  Approved claimants will receive a substantial settlement simply by\ncompleting a proof of claim form and mailing it back to the Claims Administrator for\nverification and approval.  Each claimant whose claim is rejected will receive a letter\nexplaining why the claim was rejected, and will be provided the opportunity of an\nappeal first to the Claims Administrator, and then to this Court.  There was no\nevidence at the hearing that claimants do not understand the terms of the\nsettlement, find the proof of claim form confusing or hard to complete, or do not\nunderstand the process by which they may assert a claim for recovery of a portion\nof the settlement.\n18. 4,935 notices have been mailed to potential claimants explaining the\nterms of the settlement and detailing the method by which claimants could file\nobjections.  No objections to the terms of the settlement discussed above were\n8\n\nfiled prior to the hearing, and only one person appeared at the hearing to object,\nand the Court regards this fact as additional evidence establishing the fairness,\nreasonableness and adequacy of the settlement under review.\n19. The Claims Administrator, Analytics, Inc., is continuing to seek\npotential claimants for whom it has no address or has a bad address, and mail\nnotice as soon as a new address is found.  In addition, all persons who contacted\nPlaintiffs' counsel or the Claims Administrator to advise of their potential claim\nwere also mailed claim forms.  Notice of the settlement will be published in the\ncoming weeks in newspapers generally circulated in Bullitt County, and claimants\nhave until February 17, 2009 -- ample time -- in which to file their claims.      \n20. One unnamed class member, Mr. Lavey, appeared at the fairness\nhearing and objected to the settlement.  He stated that it was unfair to allow only\none payment per class member no matter how many times that class memberโs\nconstitutional rights were violated by being strip-searched upon entry to the\ndetention center.  To the extent that the court addressed this issue during the\npreliminary approval of the settlement, those findings are reaffirmed.  The court\nadditionally finds that there are two factors to be weighed โ precision versus\nsufficiency.  On the one hand, compensating a claimant for every single\nconstitutional violation precisely โ thus the concept of precision โ versus on the\nother hand, how much is enough to establish that there was a constitutional\nviolation and to create a corrective action โ thus the concept of sufficiency.  The\n9\n\npurpose here is not to pay people money, but to recognize that there are violations\nof constitutional rights and to provide a corrective function.  This was\naccomplished through several aspects of the settlement.  First, the parties agreed\non a cap per claimant that was premised on a one-search limit.  Second, the\nsettlement addresses the class as a whole and not merely individuals.  Third, the\nadministrative process is made more complex and more costly if the one-search\nlimit is not applied.  Fourth, the delay will be significant if there are administrative\nand factual disputes over multiple searches.  Fifth, there comes a point at which,\ninstead of remedying a constitutional violation and trying to correct the facilityโs\nprocess, the settlement would begin to reward people for multiple arrests.  The line\non this last aspect is adequately drawn by the one-search limit.  Additionally, some\nof the named class representatives were victims of multiple entry strip-searches. \nGiven all the factors just enumerated, and given this tension between the notions of\nprecision and sufficiency, the settlement adequately strikes the balance.  Finding\nthat the settlementโs provision allowing for only one recovery per class member is\nfair, reasonable and adequate, the court overrules the objection.  \nFor all the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that the settlement in this\nlitigation is fair, reasonable and adequate under the circumstances, and that the\ninterests of the class as a whole are better served by this settlement instead of the\npursuit of this litigation through trial.  By separate Judgment, claims of all class\nmembers who have not made a timely request to be excluded from the class will be\n10\n\ndismissed with prejudice.\nAccordingly,\nIT IS ORDERED that the class action settlement is APPROVED as fair,\nreasonable, and adequate in accordance with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.\nSigned on  November 19, 2008\n11",

INTRODUCTION \nThe parties, by counsel, enter into this Settlement Agreement (\"the Agreement\"), \nwhich they will submit to the Court for its approval.  The Agreement: (a) contemplates \ncertification of a class consisting of all persons who allege that they were arrested for any \nqualifying non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor offense, and were strip-searched at \nthe Bullitt County Detention Center (\"the Jail\") from March 2, 2004 to the present, when \nthere existed no basis for a reasonable, individualized suspicion that they were carrying or \nconcealing weapons or contraband; and (b) settles all claims of the class, including, without \nlimitation on the generality of the foregoing, claims of class representatives and absent \nclass members who have not opted out, for all money damages, attorneysโ fees, litigation \nexpenses, and interest, by establishing a common fund of $800,000.00, to be shared \namong participating class members after payment of attorneysโ fees, litigation expenses, \n \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00130-JBC-JDM   Document 40-2    Filed 05/27/08   Page 2 of 14 PageID #: 138\n \nclaims administration expenses, and payment to class representatives as provided  in ยถ 31 \nbelow.  Under this Agreement class members will receive one payment no matter how \nmany times they were admitted into and/or searched while incarcerated at the Jail during \nthe class period. \nII.  TERMS \nA.  Class Definition and Certification \n1.  The Court, with the consent of the parties, shall certify a class composed of all \npersons who allege that after their arrest for any qualifying non-violent, non-drug related \nmisdemeanor offense, they were strip-searched at the Jail from March 2, 2004 to the \npresent, when there existed no basis for a reasonable, individualized suspicion that they \nwere carrying or concealing weapons or contraband  (hereafter referred to collectively as \n\"the Class\"). \n2.  Notice of the certification of the class and settlement shall issue within 30 \ndays following the Court's preliminary approval of this settlement, both directly to the last \nknown addresses of all potential class members and by publication, and in a form to be \nagreed upon by the parties, approved by the Court, and intended to maximize notice to the \nclass and ease the filing of proofs of claim and administration of the settlement. \nB.   Settlement Fund \n3.  Defendants will provide a settlement fund of $800,000.00 to settle all claims of \nPlaintiffs and the class, including claims for attorneysโ fees and litigation expenses, costs of \nadministering the settlement, and interest, if any. \n4.  The parties agree and acknowledge that Defendants have denied liability in \nwhole, and that the payment and other agreements contained herein were made and were \n  2 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00130-JBC-JDM   Document 40-2    Filed 05/27/08   Page 3 of 14 PageID #: 139\n \ngiven without admission of liability which is expressly denied, and which payment and other \nagreements were made and given by Defendants solely for the purpose of avoiding the \nexpense of litigation, attorneysโ fees, and other costs. No language contained in this \nAgreement or in any orders issued by the Court approving or denying either preliminary or \nfinal approval to this Agreement shall in any way be construed as acknowledgments or \nadmissions of liability, all of which are expressly denied by Defendants. \n5.  Defendants and their counsel agree to provide reasonable assistance to \nPlaintiffsโ counsel and to the Claims Administrator to facilitate the administration of this \nsettlement by providing access to data, information and documents necessary to determine \nthe last known address and contact information for all potential class members.  Any \ninformation provided pursuant  to such disclosure order shall be used only in connection \nwith this litigation, and shall be kept confidential and not disclosed to anyone other than \nPlaintiffs' counsel and the Claims Administrator except as set forth in this Agreement. \n6.  Any request for such additional fees and costs shall be by application to the \nCourt with opportunity for objection by Defendants.  No such motion shall be allowed nor \nany additional fees or costs paid by the Defendants due to delays in the claims process for \nany reason, provided the Defendants have paid the $800,000.00 settlement proceeds set \nforth  in  ยถ  3  above  to  the  Claims  Administrator  to  establish  the  settlement  fund  in \naccordance with this Agreement.  The payment of said amount shall fulfill and satisfy any \nand all financial obligations of the Defendants under this Agreement and no further fees or \ncosts of  any kind shall be paid by the Defendants. \n7.  Defendants shall maintain and control the settlement funds until such time as \nthey are distributed to the Claims Administrator, who shall set up an interest bearing bank \n  3 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00130-JBC-JDM   Document 40-2    Filed 05/27/08   Page 4 of 14 PageID #: 140\n \naccount  or  accounts at  a bank  within  the Commonwealth of  Kentucky,  as may  be \nappropriate, for payment of the qualifying individual claims which may be allowed under this \nAgreement.  The Claims Administrator shall also post a bond and obtain appropriate \ninsurance  to  guarantee  the  performance  of  the  obligations  required  of  the  Claims \nAdministrator under this Agreement and to pay for any claims of liability in connection with \nadministration of the settlement fund.

Class members will receive only one \npayment no matter how many times they were admitted into and/or searched while \nincarcerated at the Jail during the class period. \n34.    Payments to class members shall not exceed $1500.00 except for the seven \nnamed Plaintiffs as set forth in ยถ 31 above. \n35.

If a claimantโs \ncheck is returned and the Claims Administrator has no record of a forwarding address,  the \nClaims Administrator, after consulting with counsel for the parties, shall have discretion to \ntake reasonable steps to locate such claimant. \nX.  POST-DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION \n37.  Any settlement funds remaining after all settlement checks have been \ndistributed and all costs, expenses and attorneysโ fees have been paid will be returned by \nthe Claims Administrator to Defendants. \n 38.

The \nparties have expressly agreed that the release of claims arising from the settlement \nincludes all visual inspections, including without limitation visual body cavity inspections, \nthat otherwise fall within the scope of the claims certified as a class action by the Court in \nthis case.  The parties also agree that all such claims against all of Defendants' employees \nand other agents are barred because the settlement expressly covers Defendants, its \nemployees and agents.

Introduction\n1.  Kimberly Miracle, Jeffrey Fleenor, Richard Daily, April Griffith, Keith Wilson \nand Earl Taylor, Plaintiffs, file this action in their individual capacity and on behalf of all \npersons arrested for non-violent minor offenses who were required by Defendants to \nremove their clothing for a visual body cavity search on admission to the Bullitt County \nDetention  Center  (hereinafter  โthe  Jailโ)  despite  the  absence  of  any  reasonable, \nindividualized suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  \nThis class of people includes all individuals who were so treated from March 3, 2004 to the \npresent. \n2.  Such searches have been regularly conducted by Defendants and there are \nhundreds of members of this class.  There are questions of law and fact in this case that \n\nCasCea 3se:0 35:-0c5v--0cv0-103001-3J0B-CJB-JCD-MJD  M D o  c  uDmoecunmt 3e1n t   2F8ile-2d   1  0  /F2i4le/0d7 1  0 P/1a1g/2e0 20 7o f   1  0P Pagaeg e2I Do f# 1: 0105\nare common to all members of this class.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of those of their \nclass, and they will fairly and adequately protect the interests of this class. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue\n3.  Plaintiffs, and all other similarly situated, seek actual and punitive damages \nfrom Defendants under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. ยง1983, for gross and \nunconscionable violations of the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed them by the \nFourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United \nStates.  Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. ยง1331 and ยง1343.  Plaintiffs and the other members of her class also seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages under the pendent jurisdiction of this \nCourt for negligence, gross negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  As \nBullitt County, Kentucky is the residence of all defendant parties to this action and the \nlocation of all acts pertinent to this suit, venue is proper in this Court. \nIII.  Class Action\n4.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), (2) and \n(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The class consists of all individuals arrested for \nnon-violent minor offenses who, since March 3, 2004, were required to remove their \nclothing for a visual inspection of their naked bodies on admission to the Jail despite the \nabsence of any reasonable, individualized suspicion that they were carrying or concealing \nweapons or contraband. \n5.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of all class members.  \nThey are members of the class and their claims are typical of the claims of all class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs were offended at the treatment accorded them and the class members \n2\n\nCasCea 3se:0 35:-0c5v--0cv0-103001-3J0B-CJB-JCD-MJD  M D o  c  uDmoecunmt 3e1n t   2F8ile-2d   1  0  /F2i4le/0d7 1  0 P/1a1g/2e0 30 7o f   1  0P Pagaeg e3I Do f# 1: 0106\nand will aggressively pursue the interests of the entire class.  Plaintiffsโ interest in obtaining \ninjunctive relief and actual and punitive damages for the violations of their constitutional \nrights and privileges are consistent with and not antagonistic of those of any other person \nwithin her class. \n6.  Given the circumstances of their search, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non information and belief, that Defendants regularly require all persons arrested for \nnonviolent minor offenses to remove their clothing for at least a visual inspection of their \nnaked bodies -- and in most instances for a visual body cavity search -- on admission to the \nJail, even though there exists no reasonable grounds for believing that such individuals are \ncarrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  Such searches violate the Fourth, Fifth, \nEighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, 42 \nU.S.C. ยง1983 and the clearly established law of this circuit set forth in Masters v. Crouch, \n872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.), cert denied, 493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503 (1989).  The only \nquestion that remains to be resolved is whether Plaintiffs and the members of the class are \nentitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, or to an award of compensatory and punitive \ndamages and, if so, the extent of such an award. \n7.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy because: \na.  A multiplicity of suits with consequent burden on the \ncourts and Defendants should be avoided. \nb.  It would be virtually impossible for all class members to \nintervene as parties-plaintiff in this action. \nc.  Upon adjudication of Defendants' liability, claims of the \nclass members can be determined by this Court. \n3\n\nCasCea 3se:0 35:-0c5v--0cv0-103001-3J0B-CJB-JCD-MJD  M D o  c  uDmoecunmt 3e1n t   2F8ile-2d   1  0  /F2i4le/0d7 1  0 P/1a1g/2e0 40 7o f   1  0P Pagaeg e4I Do f# 1: 0107\nIV.  Parties\n  8.  Plaintiffs are all residents of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \n  9.  Defendant Bullitt County at all times mentioned herein, employed, was \nresponsible for the establishment of policies either formally or by custom for, and was \nresponsible for the employment, training, supervision and conduct of the officers and \nemployees of the Jail. \n  10.  Defendant Danny Fackler is Jailer of Bullitt County, and as such, established \npolicies formally or by custom for, and was responsible for the employment, training, \nsupervision and conduct of, the officers and employees of the Jail. \nV.     Nature of Defendants' Conduct\n  11.  Defendants, individually and in conspiracy with one another, engaged in the \nconduct described below under color of the law of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and \nBullitt County.  The offenses described below resulted from the failure of the state and \ncounty agencies and individuals to employ qualified persons for positions of authority, \nand/or to properly or conscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such persons after \ntheir employment, and/or to promulgate appropriate operating policies and procedures \neither formally or by custom to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.  Defendants' conduct was intentional or grossly negligent, or  \nindicated active malice toward Plaintiffs and the class or at least a total and reckless \ndisregard for and indifference to their constitutional and common law rights, justifying an \naward of punitive damages in addition to the actual damages which Plaintiffs and the class \nare entitled to recover. \n4\n\nCasCea 3se:0 35:-0c5v--0cv0-103001-3J0B-CJB-JCD-MJD  M D o  c  uDmoecunmt 3e1n t   2F8ile-2d   1  0  /F2i4le/0d7 1  0 P/1a1g/2e0 50 7o f   1  0P Pagaeg e5I Do f# 1: 0108\nVI.

Plaintiff Jeffrey Fleener was arrested on or about May 30, 2004 for a non-\nviolent misdemeanor offense.  He was taken to the Jail where he was subjected to a visual \nbody cavity search when Defendants had no reasonable, individualized suspicion that he \nwas carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  \n  15.  Plaintiff Richard Dailey was arrested on or about September 6, 2004 for non-\nviolent misdemeanor offenses.  He was taken to the Jail where he was subjected to a \nvisual body cavity search when Defendants had no reasonable, individualized suspicion \nthat he was carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. \n  16.  Plaintiff April Griffith was arrested on or about February 22, 2005 and July 13, \n2005  for non-violent misdemeanor offense.

He was taken to the Jail where he was subjected to a visual \nbody cavity search when Defendants had no reasonable, individualized suspicion that he \nwas carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. \nVII.     The Law and Defendants' Policy\n  18.  On April 18, 1989, the Sixth Circuit issued its opinion in Masters v. Crouch, \nsupra, in which it held: \nIt was clearly established on October 21, 1986 โฆ that a person \ncharged with only a traffic violation or nonviolent minor offense \nmay  not  be  subjected  to  a  strip-search  unless  there  are \nreasonable grounds for believing that the particular person \nmight be carrying or concealing weapons or other contraband. \nId. at 1257.  Like the Sixth Circuit, the courts have consistently held that a non-violent minor \noffense, in and of itself, does not give rise to sufficient institutional security concerns to \njustify strip-searches that have been described as \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, \nhumiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and \nsubmission.\"  Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).  In this \ncase, Plaintiffs were arrested for non-violent minor offenses.  Neither their behavior nor \ntheir background gave Defendants any reasonable grounds for believing that they might be \ncarrying  or  concealing  weapons  or  other  contraband.    Under  such  circumstances, \nDefendants' requirement that Plaintiffs expose the most private parts of their physical \nperson for a visual inspection was unconscionable, was an illegal strip/visual body cavity \nsearch by any definition, and was a flagrant violation of the clearly-established law.   \n6\n\nCasCea 3se:0 35:-0c5v--0cv0-103001-3J0B-CJB-JCD-MJD  M D o  c  uDmoecunmt 3e1n t   2F8ile-2d   1  0  /F2i4le/0d7 1  0 P/1a1g/2e0 70 7o f   1  0P Pagaeg e7I Do f# 1: 0110\nVIII.     Causes of Action\nA.     Count I\n  19.  Paragraphs 1-18 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 19. \n  20.  Plaintiffs' searches, described above, were part of a continuing pattern of \nmisconduct and were the result of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, procedures, \ncustoms and practices of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Bullitt County, either written \nor unwritten, that are systematically applied whenever an arrestee is admitted to or \nreleased from the Jail.  Such practices constitute an arbitrary use of government power, \nand evince a total, intentional and unreasonable disregard for the constitutional and \ncommon law rights of the citizens of Kentucky, including Plaintiffs and the members of the \nclass, and the wholesale violations of those rights likely to result from the systematic pursuit \nof such practices. \n  21.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs and their class, through Defendants' \nintentional or grossly negligent conduct, were deprived without due process of law of the \nfollowing rights and immunities guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United States in \nviolation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: \na.  Their  right  to  be  secure  in  their  person  against \nunreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments; \nb.  Their  right  to  privacy  in  their  person  against \nunreasonable intrusions under the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth \nand Fourteenth Amendments;  \nc.  Their right to the equal protection of the law secured by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment; and \n7\n\nCasCea 3se:0 35:-0c5v--0cv0-103001-3J0B-CJB-JCD-MJD  M D o  c  uDmoecunmt 3e1n t   2F8ile-2d   1  0  /F2i4le/0d7 1  0 P/1a1g/2e0 80 7o f   1  0P Pagaeg e8I Do f# 1: 0111\nd.  Their right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual \npunishment  under  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments. \n  22.  Moreover, given the pre-existing law that clearly prohibited Defendants' \nconduct, Defendants' searches of Plaintiffs and the members of their class were intentional, \nwanton and malicious, and were indicative of Defendants' total and reckless disregard of, \nindifference to the rights of, and rise of harm to, Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nclass. \nB.    Count II\n23.  Paragraphs 1-22 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 23. \n24.  Defendants have blatantly violated the provisions of KRS 441.025 and \n441.055, and 501 KAR 3:120(3)(1)(b) and (c). \nC.     Count III\n  25.  Paragraphs 1-24 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 25. \n  26.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants, without justification, negligently or \nintentionally inflicted upon Plaintiffs and the class severe mental and emotional distress. \nD.     Count IV\n  27.  Paragraphs 1-26 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 26. \n  28.

As a result, \nthey have suffered, and are entitled to recover, actual damages.  Furthermore, Defendants' \nviolations of the constitutional and common law rights of the Plaintiffs and the class were \ncruel, malicious and evinced a total and reckless disregard for and indifference to those \nrights, entitling Plaintiffs and the class to recover punitive damages from Defendants in \norder to deter such conduct in the future. \nX.     Declaratory Judgment and Permanent Injunction\n  31.  Paragraphs 1-30 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 30. \n  32.  In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiffs and the class request that this Court \nissue a declaratory judgment deeming unconstitutional any and all statutes, ordinances, \nregulations, policies, procedures, customs or practices under which they were forced to \nexpose their bodies for visual inspection, and further request that this Court permanently \nenjoin the Defendants from following or enforcing such statutes, ordinances, regulations, \npolicies, procedures, customs or usages. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class they represent request (a) that this action \nproceed as a class action under Fed.

Box 216  ) \nShepherdsville, KY  40165  ) \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n** ** ** ** ** \nI.  Introduction \n1.  Kimberly Miracle and Melisa Squires file this action in their individual capacity \nand  on  behalf of all  persons  arrested for minor offenses who were  required  by the \nDefendants in the Bullitt County Jail (hereinafter \"Jail\") to remove their clothing for a visual \n\n... \n; \ninspection on admission to the Jail despite the absence of any reasonable suspicion that \nthey were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. This class of people includes all \nindividuals who were so treated from March 3, 2004 to the present. \n2.  Such searches have been and continue to be regularly conducted by the \nDefendants and there are hundreds of members of this class.  There are questions of law \nand fact in this case that are common to all members of this class.  Plaintiffs' claims are \ntypical of those of this respective class, and they will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of this class. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n3.  Plaintiffs, and all other similarly situated, seek actual and punitive damages \nfrom  Defendants under the Civil  Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.  ยง1983, for gross and \nunconscionable violations of the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed them by the \nFourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United \nStates. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C.  ยง1331  and  ยง1343.  Plaintiffs and  the other members of her class  also  seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages under the pendent jurisdiction of this \nCourt for negligence, gross negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  As \nBullitt County, Kentucky is the residence of all defendant parties to this action and location \nof all acts pertinent to this suit, venue is proper in this Court. \nIII.  Class Action \n4.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), (2) and \n(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The class consists of all individuals arrested for \nminor offenses who were required to remove their clothing for a visual inspection on \n2 \n\n:. \nadmission to the Jail despite the absence of any reasonable suspicion that they were \ncarrying or concealing weapons or contraband. \n5.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of all class members. \nThey are members of the class and their claims are typical of the claims of all class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs were offended at the treatment accorded them and the class members \nand will aggressively pursue the interests ofthe entire class. Plaintiffs' interest in obtaining \ninjunctive relief and actual and punitive damages for the violations of their constitutional \nrights and privileges are consistent with and not antagonistic of those of any other person \nwithin her class. \n6.  Given the circumstances oftheir search, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non  information  and  belief,  that Defendants  regularly  require  all  persons  arrested  for \nnonviolent minor offenses to remove their clothing for a visual inspection of their bodies on \nadmission to the Jail, even though there exists no reasonable grounds for believing that \nweapons or contraband have been concealed upon their persons.  Such searches violate \nthe Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the \nUnited States, Title 42 U.S.C. ยง1983, Bel/v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979) and the clearly \nestablished law of this circuit, as set forth in Masters v.  Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.), \ncert denied, 493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503 (1989).  The only question that remains to be \nresolved is whether Plaintiffs and the members of the class are entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, or to award of compensatory and punitive damages and, if so, the extent of \nsuch an award. \n7.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy because: \n106229v1 \n34160ยท1 \n3 \n\na.  A multiplicity of suits with consequent burden on the \ncourts and Defendants should be avoided. \nb.  It would be virtually impossible for all class members to \nintervene as parties-plaintiff in this action. \nc.  Upon adjudication of Defendants' liability, claims of the \nclass members can be determined by this Court. \n8.  Plaintiffs are residents of Jefferson County within the Commonwealth of \nKentucky. \n9.  The Defendant, Bullitt County, at all times mentioned herein, employed, was \nresponsible for the establishment of policies either formally or by custom for, and was \nresponsible for the employment, training, supervision and  conduct of the officers and \nemployees of the Bullitt County Jail. \n10.  The Defendant,  Danny Fackler,  is Jailer of Bullitt County, and  as  such, \nestablished policies formally or by custom for, and was responsible for the employment, \ntraining, supervision and conduct of, the officers and employees of the Bullitt County Jail. \nV.  Nature of Defendants' Conduct \n11.  Defendants, individually and in conspiracy with one another, engaged in the \nconduct described below under color of the law of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and \nBullitt County.  The offenses described below resulted from the failure of the state and \ncounty agencies and individuals to employ qualified persons for positions of authority, \nand/or to properly or conscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such persons after \ntheir employment, and/or to promulgate appropriate operating policies and procedures \neither formally or by custom to protect the constitutional  rights  of the citizens of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.  Defendants' conduct was intentional or grossly negligent, or \nindicated active malice toward Plaintiffs and the class or at least a total and  reckless \n4 \n\" \n\ndisregard for and indifference to their constitutional and common law rights, justifying an \naward of punitive damages in addition to the actual damages which Plaintiffs and the class \nare entitled to recover. \nVI.  Facts \n12.  The Plaintiff, Kimberly Miracle, was arrested on March 3, 2004 and charged \nwith  violations  of various  motor vehicle statues,  including  failure to  wear a seatbelt, \nimproper registration plates, no insurance, giving a false name to police, and driving under \nthe influence of alcohol, all misdemeanor offenses. She was arrested and was taken to the \nBullitt County Jail.  There, she was taken into a room where she was told to remove her \nclothes, bend over, and spread apart her buttocks and cough. \n13.  The Plaintiff, Melisa Squires, was arrested March 16, 2004. On arrival of the \nBullitt County Jail, she was strip-searched in the same manner as Ms. Miracle.  Although \nMs. Squires was charged with possession of a controlled substance, this was attributable to \nback pain medication in Ms. Squires' possession at the time of her arrest, which did not \ngive rise to a reasonable suspicion that she was carrying or concealing weapons or \ncontraband. \nVII.  The Law and Defendants' Policy \n14.  In 1979, the United States Supreme Court held that a pretrial detainee has \nthe right not to be searched unless the reasonableness of such a search is established by \n\"balancing ... the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that \nthe search entails.\" Bell v. Wolfish, supra at 559 (emphasis added). On April 18, 1989, the \nSixth Circuit issued its opinion in Masters v. Crouch, supra, in which it held: \nIt was clearly established on October 21 , 1986 ... that a person \ncharged with only a traffic violation or nonviolent minor offense \n5 \n\nmay  not  be  subjected  to  a  strip-search  unless  there  are \nreasonable grounds for believing that the particular person \nmight be carrying or concealing weapons or other contraband. \nId. at 1257.  In this case, Plaintiffs were arrested for nonviolent minor offenses.  Neither \ntheir behavior nor their background gave Defendants any reasonable grounds for believing \nthat they might be carrying or concealing weapons or other contraband.  Under such \ncircumstances, Defendants' requirement that Plaintiffs expose the most private parts of \ntheir physical person for a visual inspection was unconscionable, was an illegal strip-search \nby any definition and was a flagrant violation of the balancing requirement of Bell v. \nWolfish, supra. \nVIII.  Causes of Action \nA.  Count I \n15.  Paragraphs 1-14 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 15. \n16.  Plaintiffs' searches, described above, was part of a continuing pattern of \nmisconduct and  is the result of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, procedures, \ncustoms and practices of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Bullitt County, either written \nor unwritten, that are  systematically applied  whenever an  arrestee is  admitted  to  or \nreleased  from  the  Bullitt  County Jail.  Such  practices constitute  an  arbitrary use  of \ngovernment power, and evince a total, intentional and unreasonable disregard for the \nconstitutional and common law rights of the citizens of Kentucky, including Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class, and the wholesale violations of those rights likely to result from the \nsystematic pursuit of such practices. \n6 \n\n17.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs and their class, through Defendants' \nintentional or grossly negligent conduct, were deprived without due process of law of the \nfollowing rights and immunities guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United States in \nviolation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: \na.  Their  right  to  be  secure  in  their  person  against \nunreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments; \nb.  Their  right  to  privacy  in  their  person  against \nunreasonable intrusions under the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth \nand Fourteenth Amendments; \nc.  Their right to the equal protection of the law secured by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment; and \nd.  Their right not to be subjected to  cruel and  unusual \npunishment  under  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments. \n18.  Moreover,  given the  pre-existing  law that clearly prohibited  Defendants' \nconduct, Defendants' searches of Plaintiffs and the members of their class were intentional, \nwanton and malicious, and were indicative of Defendants' total and reckless disregard of, \nindifference to the rights of, and rise of harm to, Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nclass. \nB.  Count II \n19.  Paragraphs 1-18 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 19. \n20.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants, without justification, negligently or \nintentionally inflicted upon Plaintiffs and the class severe mental and emotional distress. \nC.  Count III \n7 \n\n21.  Paragraphs 1-20 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 21. \n22.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants were negligent, and grossly negligent, \nall to the damage of the Plaintiffs and the class. \nIX.  Damages \n23.  Paragraphs 1-22 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 23. \n24.  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class  were  unjustifiably  and \nunconstitutionally searched in a manner that generated tremendous and overwhelming \nembarrassment, humiliation, and mental and emotional distress.  As a result, they have \nsuffered, and are entitled to recover, actual damages. Furthermore, Defendants'violations \nof the constitutional and common law rights of the Plaintiffs and the class were cruel, \nmalicious and evinced a total and reckless disregard for and indifference to those rights, \nentitling Plaintiffs and the class to recover punitive damages from Defendants in order to \ndeter such conduct in the future. \nX.  Declaratory Judgment and Permanent Injunction \n25.  Paragraphs 1-24 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 25. \n26.  In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiffs and the class request that this Court \nissue a declaratory judgment deeming unconstitutional any and all statutes, ordinances, \nregulations, policies, procedures, customs or practices under which they were forced to \nexpose their genitalia for visual inspection, and further request that this Court permanently \n8 \n\nenjoin the Defendants from following or enforcing such statutes, ordinances, regulations, \npolicies, procedures, customs or usages. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class they represent request (a) that this action \nproceed as a class action under Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23 and (b) a trial by jury, and further \nrequest that they and  all  members  of the  class  (c)  be  awarded  actual  and  punitive \ndamages, (d) be granted the declaratory and injunctive relief requested herein, and (e) be \nawarded their costs, attorney fees, pre- and post-judgment interest and all other relief to \nwhich they are entitled under law or in equity. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDinsmore  ohl LLP \n1400 PNC Plaza \n500 West Jefferson Street \nLouisville, KY  40202 \nTelephone:  (502) 540-2300 \nFacsimile:  (502) 585-2207 \nI~!)~~ \nRobert D.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nBULLITT COUNTY, KENTUCKY, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.\n* * * * * * * * * * *\nThis matter is before the court upon the joint status report of the parties (R.   \n63).  Two claimants, John P. Burk and Todd Mettling, Jr., have appealed the denial \nof their claims (R. 59, 60).  The court will affirm the decisions of the claims \nadministrator and deny their claims because the claimants do not qualify as \nmembers of the class. \nI. John P. Burk\nThe claimant John P. Burk admits that he was arrested for public intoxication \nand possession of a controlled substance, โzanax [sic],โ in 2004 or 2005.  He was \nstrip-searched and inducted into the Bullitt County Detention Center.  Appealing the \ndenial of his claim, Burk contends that because he was not arrested for a violent \noffense and was not convicted of the drug-related offense, his strip-search was \nunlawful, and he deserves compensation.  See R. 59, 61. \nIn this suit, the class consists of โall persons who were arrested for any \nqualifying non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor offense, and were strip-\nsearched at the Bullitt County Detention Center (โthe Jailโ) from March 2, 2004, \n\nto the present, when there existed no basis for a reasonable, individualized \nsuspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.โ  R. 47.  \nAs he admits, Burk was arrested, in part, for a drug-related misdemeanor.  It is \nimmaterial to the legality of the strip-search at the Jail whether he was \nsubsequently convicted or acquitted of the drug-related misdemeanor, or whether \nthat charge was dismissed.  Because he was booked on a drug-related charge, John \nP. Burk does not qualify to be a member of the class, and his claim must be denied. \n    \nII. Todd Mettling, Jr. \n \nThe claimant Todd Mettling, Jr. was twice inducted into the Jail during the \nsubject period: once in December 2005, and again in February 2008.  See R. 62.  \nAppealing the denial of his claim, he argues that both strip-searches were illegal.  \nMettling, Jr.โs arrest in December 2005 was for reckless driving, driving \nunder the influence (4th offense), fleeing (1st degree), trafficking in marijuana (1st \noffense), possession of drug paraphernalia (1st offense), possession of a controlled \nsubstance, and tampering with physical evidence.  See id.  Because most of these \noffenses are felonies,1 and the class of plaintiffs in this suit includes only those \ncharged with misdemeanors, the strip-search of Mettling, Jr. in December 2005 \ndoes not place him in the class involved in the action. \nIn February 2008, Mettling, Jr. was arrested again, this time for a variety of\n1See, e.g., Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยงยง 520.020, 524.100 (2009).\n2\n\ntraffic offenses, all misdemeanors.2  He was booked in the Jail and underwent a \nstrip-search, which he claims was unlawful.\nRoutine strip-searching of pre-trial detainees is not a per se violation of \nthe Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.  \nSee Mills v. City of Barbourville, 389 F.3d 568, 578 (6th Cir. 2004) (citing Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979)).  Yet โa strip-search of a person arrested for \na traffic violation or other minor offense not normally associated with violence and \nconcerning whom there is no individualized reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is \ncarrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband, is unreasonable.โ  Masters v. \nCrouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989).  By February 2008, however, \nMettling, Jr. had a history of arrests for drug-related and other felonies, including \nbut not limited to his arrest and booking in the Jail in December 2005.3  Whether or \nnot the officials at the Jail in February 2008 remembered or knew about the \nDecember 2005 arrest, recognized the defendant personally, intended Mettling, Jr.\n2Bullitt County records indicate that Mettling, Jr. was charged with failure to\nwear seat belts, reckless driving, driving on license suspended due to a previous\nDUI charge (1st offense), no/expired registration plates, no/expired registration\nreceipt, failure of non-owner operator to maintain required insurance (1st offense),\nand operating on a suspended/revoked operators license.  See R. 62. \n3Before 2005, Mettling, Jr. was convicted of multiple crimes, including\noperating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs, probation\nviolation, public intoxication, and identity theft.  His record also reveals drug-related\ncharges in 2006 which were not discussed by the parties, but lend further weight\nto โindividualized, reasonable suspicionโ present in 2008.  See R. 60.\n3\n\nto be intermingled in the general population of the Jail,4 or strip-searched him as a \nmatter of routine, โinstitutional convenience,โ5 Mettling, Jr. had a โhistory that \nindicat[ed] possession or manufacturing of contraband.โ6  Mettling Jr.โs criminal \nbackground, which included charges of possessing and trafficking drugs, was a \nbasis for โa reasonable, individualized suspicionโ that he was โcarrying or \nconcealing...contraband.โ  R. 47.  Therefore, concerning both the December 2005 \nand February 2008 strip-searches, Todd Mettling, Jr. falls outside the definition of \nthe class in this suit.  Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that the decisions of the claims administrator are AFFIRMED \nand the claims of John P. Burk and Todd Mettling, Jr. are DENIED.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within fifteen (15) days from the date of entry \nof this order, the parties shall file a joint status report advising whether all claims \ncan be dismissed, and whether they should be dismissed with or without prejudice. \nSigned on  July 24, 2009\n4See generally Masters, 872 F.2d at 1254-55 (discussing intermingling in the\nbalancing of privacy interests with institutional security). \n5Id. at 1254 (citing Mary Beth G. v.
