    "summary": "<p>On April 17, 1987, a female arrestee filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, challenging the constitutionality of the strip-search policy of Calumet City, Illinois.  Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that the Calumet City Police Department policy of strip-searching women who had been arrested for non-felony offenses, without any particularized belief that the arrestee possessed either a weapon or contraband violated the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as applied to state actors via the Fourteenth Amendment.  On September 4, 1987, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint which added class action allegations.</p><p>The class certification issue was effected by the question of whether the §1983 statute of limitations period was two years or five years.  On October 1, 1987, the District Court (Judge Milton Shadur) certified the case as a class action, conditionally defining the class as all women who had been arrested on a misdemeanor or ordinance violation in Calumet City, Illinois on or after April 17, 1982.  The class, so defined, would consist of all women arrested less than five years before the action was brought.  On February 6, 1989, the District Court (Judge Shadur) finally determined that the five-year limitation period applied and, therefore, permanently re-confirmed the five-year plaintiff class.  Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 707 F.Supp. 343 (N.D.Ill. 1989).  </p><p>Following the District Court's re-confirmation of the five-year class, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Kalimara v. Illinois Department of Corrections, 879 F.2d 276, 277 (7th Cir. 1989), established that the limitations period under §1983 was two years rather than five years.  In response, the District Court (Judge Shadur), on September 19, 1989, modified its prior certification of the plaintiff class by substituting a starting date of April 17, 1985 in place of April 17, 1982.  Plaintiffs, however, immediately filed a motion for reconsideration on grounds that the District Court, in its September 19 opinion, had made an error of reasoning in applying the relation-back doctrine because, at the time the Complaint was filed, a five-year statute of limitations period applied for Illinois-grounded §1983 actions.  The Court (Judge Shadur) reconsidered the matter and, concluding that Plaintiffs were correct, let stand its prior certification of the five year-class with an opening-class date of April 17, 1982.  Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 128 F.R.D. 93 (N.D.Ill. 1989).</p><p>Following resolution of the class certification issue, Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.  Judge Shadur granted Plaintiffs' motion on December 12, 1990.  Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 754 F.Supp. 1211 (N.D.Ill. 1990).  Plaintiffs then moved for an award of interim attorneys fees in the amount of $300,000.  Judge Shadur granted the fee request on February 15, 1991.  Doe v. Calumet City, 1991 WL 22537 (N.D.Ill. Feb 15, 1991).</p><p>Settlement negotiations followed and the parties arrived at a Settlement Agreement.  Under the Agreement, Calumet City agreed to pay $6.013 million into a common fund to settle all claims for damages, expenses, and attorneys' fees.  Attorneys' fees and expenses were to be paid from the fund and were not to exceed 30% of the total.  The remainder of the fund would be used to pay class claims based on an agreed distribution formula.  The amount paid to each individual would depend on the intrusiveness of the search to which the individual was allegedly subjected.  Individual awards were anticipated to range from $3000 to $24,000.  The Court preliminarily approved the settlement on September 10, 1993 and, after conducting an October 22, 1993 fairness hearing, issued a final order of approval.</p><p>The Court thereafter issued several post settlement rulings resolving issues relating to the claims of individual members of the plaintiff class.  See Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 1993 WL 157602 (N.D.Ill. May 12, 1993) (denying request to reverse the exclusion of certain class members from participation in the damages) and Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 1993 WL 512788 (N.D.Ill. Dec 9, 1993) (responding to complaint from individual about lack of notice of the settlement).  According to the docket, the last of such proceedings was resolved in 1994.  No further proceedings are currently underway.</p><p></p>",

(cid:254)\nNOTICE OF HEARING\nON SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION\nTO:  All women who had been arrested on a misdemeanor or ordinance violation\ncharge in Calumet City, Illinois between April 16, 1982 and March 31, 1988\nA proposed settlement of the \"Calumet City strip search case\" has been submitted to\nthe Court for approval.  This document describes the proposed settlement and gives\ninstructions about what you must do if you believe that the proposed settlement should\nnot be approved.\nI.  INTRODUCTION\nThe plaintiffs in this action are all women who were arrested on misdemeanor or ordi-\nnance violation charge in Calumet City, Illinois between April 16, 1982 and March 31,\n1988.  The defendant are the City of Calumet City and its former police chief James\nShutowski.\nOn October 1, 1987, the Court ordered that the case may proceed as a class action.\nThereafter, on December 14, 1990, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary\njudgment  and  entered  a  ﬁnding  of  liability  against  Calumet  City.  Following  the\nCourt’s ruling, class counsel has provided the class with the best notice practicable and\nthe parties have exchanged information about each individual damages claim.\nII.  THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT\nCounsel for the parties have agreed to a settlement of all claims at issue in this case.\nWith  respect  to  the  claims  asserted  on  behalf  of  the  class,  the  plaintiff  class  will\nwaive its right to individual damage trials, defendant Calumet City will waive its right\nto appeal from the district court’s ﬁnding of liability and defendant Calumet City will\npay the sum of six million thirteen thousand dollars in full satisfaction of all claims\nfor damages, expenses, and attorneys’ fees.  Attorneys’ fees and expenses will be paid\nfrom this common fund, in an amount to be set by the Court and not to exceed 30%\n\n- 2 -\nof the total.  The remainder of the fund will be paid to the class.\nIII.  THE DISTRIBUTION FORMULA\nOn September 9, 1993, the Court gave preliminary approval to the following distribu-\ntion formula:\n1.  Each class member has been rated by class counsel into one of six categories,\nbased primarily on the intrusiveness of the alleged search.\n2.  The amount to be paid to each category will depend on the total number of class\nmembers in each category, as follows:\na.  Each category has received a point rating, as set out below:\nCategory  Points\n1  15\n2  25\n3  45\n4  65\n5  80\n6 (low)  100\n6 (mid)  110\n6 (high)  120\nb.  The award for each category will be determined by dividing the total of\nthe settlement fund (less whatever amount is awarded for attorneys’ fees\nand  costs)  by  the  total  number  of  points.  The  ﬁnal  award  for  each\ncategory will be approximately as follows:\nCategory  Probable Award\n1  $3000\n2  5000\n3  9000\n4  13000\n5  16000\n6 (low)  20000\n6 (mid)  22000\n6 (high)  24000\n3.  Class  counsel  has  used  the  aggravating  and  mitigating  factors  conventionally\nused  by  attorneys  in  assessing  cases  to  subdivide  category  6  into \"low,\"\n\"medium,\" and \"high.\"\n4.  A special category has been established for claims asserted for class members\nwho  are  no  longer  living.  This  category  has  been  assigned  50  points.  It  is\nexpected  that  the  estate  of  each  deceased  class  member  will  receive  approxi-\nmately ten thousand dollars.\n5.  Class counsel has notiﬁed each class member of her rating and provided each\nclass member with an opportunity to discuss in person the rating.\n\n- 3 -\n6.  A class member who disagrees with class counsel’s rating may, after discussing\nthe disagreement with class counsel, seek review of her category with the Court.\nAny such \"request for review\" shall be ﬁled with and received by the Clerk of\nthe  Court,  219  South  Dearborn  Street,  20th  ﬂoor,  Chicago,  Illinois  60604,  a\n\"request for review\" in the form set out in Exhibit \"A\" to this agreement. at least\none week in advance of the hearing to be held on the fairness of this settlement.\nAny such \"requests for review\" shall be available to counsel for inspection but\notherwise  maintained  under  seal  and  restricted  from  public  inspection.  The\nCourt shall provide each class member who ﬁles such a request for review an\nopportunity to be heard on her objections.  Any class member who, after hearing\nbefore  the  district  judge,  does  not  obtain  an  increase  in  her  total  number  of\npoints shall have her point rating diminished by ﬁve points.\n7.  After all challenges have been resolved, a ﬁnal distribution will be made by the\ncomputations described in paragraph 1(b) above.\nNOW, THEREFORE, TAKE NOTICE:\n1.  A  hearing  will  be  held  before  this  Court  in  Courtroom  2303,  United  States\nCourthouse, 219 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60604, on October 22,\n1993, at 1:30 p.m., or as soon thereafter as counsel can be heard.  The hearing\nshall be for the purpose of determining whether the terms of the proposed con-\nsent decree are fair, reasonable, and adequate, and whether the proposed consent\ndecree should be approved by the Court.  This hearing may be adjourned from\ntime to time without further written notice to the class.\n2.  Any class member who wishes to be heard either in support or in opposition to\nthe  proposed  settlement  must  ﬁle  her  written  objection  or  comment  with  the\nClerk of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 219\nSouth Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60604 on or before October 15, 1993.\nThe written objection or comment must be received in the Clerk’s ofﬁce on or\nbefore October 15, 1993.  Written objections or comments will be considered\nwhether or not the class member attends the hearing.\nThe foregoing references to the lawsuit and the settlement agreement are only sum-\nmaries.  The  settlement  agreement  and  all  other  papers  ﬁled  in  this  action  may  be\nexamined and copied in the Ofﬁce of the Clerk, 219 South Dearborn Street, 20th ﬂoor,\nChicago, Illinois between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Fri-\nday.

Brinkmeier, Chicago, Ill., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nSHADUR, District Judge.\nPlaintiff class, comprising all women who have been arrested on a misdemeanor or ordinance violation in\n1213 Calumet City, Illinois on or after April 16, 1982,[1] has sued *1213 Calumet City[2] under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n(\"Section 1983\") for alleged unconstitutional strip searches conducted by the Calumet City Police Department.\n[3]\nPlaintiffs now move under Rule 56  for summary judgment on the issue of liability. For the reasons stated in this\nmemorandum opinion and order, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is granted.\nFacts\nBetween April 16, 1982 and the April 17, 1987 commencement of this suit, members of the Calumet City Police\nDepartment conducted a large number of strip searches of women who had been arrested for non-felony\n[4]\noffenses.  All those searches were conducted without any particularized belief that any of the arrestees\npossessed either a weapon or contraband. While Calumet City had no formal policy regarding strip searches, its\npolice force routinely conducted such searches without any specific justification.\nCalumet City's practice of conducting strip searches was in effect and continued well after its neighboring city,\n[5]\nChicago, had been found liable for its own similar practice.  Indeed, effective September 21, 1979 the Illinois\nGeneral Assembly responded to the disclosure of the Chicago Police Department's strip search policy by\namending the Illinois statute governing \"Rights on Arrest\" to read (Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, ¶ 103-1(c)):\nNo person arrested for a traffic, regulatory or misdemeanor offense, except in cases involving\nweapons or a controlled substance, shall be strip searched unless there is reasonable belief that\n[6]\nthe individual is concealing a weapon or controlled substance.\nAnd that legislation was specifically referred to in the appeal growing out of the Chicago situation, Mary Beth G. v.\nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1266 n. 1 (7th Cir.1983) (more of that case later). Despite the State's recognition\nof its municipalities' unlawful methods of searching arrestees (and despite our Court of Appeals' decision in Mary\nBeth G.), Calumet City changed its strip search practice only after this lawsuit was filed.\nThis action's own \"Jane Doe\" (\"Doe\") provides a typical illustration of Calumet City's strip search practice. Doe\n1214 was arrested in December 1986 and charged with being underage in a tavern. Following her *1214 arrest, Doe\nwas transported to the Calumet City police station where she was searched by dispatcher Popovich. Popovich\nconducted a pat-down search and then asked Doe to raise her blouse and lift her brassiere over her breasts and\n\nthen down. Popovich then required Doe to drop her jeans and pull her underpants down. Popovich had no belief\nat the time of the search that Doe had a weapon or contraband on her person.\nDoe's case was one of many. Indeed, the offered testimony by the 117 women arrestees describing 146 strip\nsearches includes the following typical examples:\n[7]\n1. On November 2, 1982 class member 6628  was arrested by a Calumet City police officer on a\nwarrant for misdemeanor offenses relating to bad checks. At the police station she was required to\nremove her clothes.\n2. On August 28, 1983 class member 6453 was arrested by a Calumet City police officer for\n\"investigation\" and eventually released without being charged. At the station she was required to\nremove her shirt, lift her brassiere over her breasts, lower her pants and underpants and squat.\n3. On February 19, 1984 class member 6422 was arrested on a warrant. At the station she was\nrequired to remove her clothes, to squat three times and to spread the lips of her vagina.\n4. On June 30, 1985 class member 5227 was arrested for deceptive practices. At the station, after\nshe had removed her clothes a dispatcher lifted the arrestee's breasts.\n5. On March 13, 1986 class member 6070 was arrested for being a minor in a tavern. At the\nstation she was required to remove all her clothing.\n6. On February 21, 1987 class member 6528 was arrested for driving with a suspended license. At\nthe station she was required to remove her shirt and lower her pants and underpants.\nIn addition to being required to expose themselves, many women arrestees in Calumet City were subjected to\noffensive touching. Again the following examples will suffice:\n1. On December 5, 1982 class member 6458 (17 years old) was arrested on a misdemeanor and\nrequired to remove all her clothing. Then a female member of the department lifted the arrestee's\nbreasts and ran her fingers along the class member's genitals.\n2. On April 13, 1983 class member 5075 was arrested on a misdemeanor, required to remove all\nher clothing and searched by a woman who, clad in rubber gloves, felt around the class member's\nvagina and anus.\n3. On February 12, 1986 class member 6771, arrested on a misdemeanor, was required to\nremove all her clothing and instructed to squat and then to bend over. While bent over, the class\nmember felt the female searcher insert her gloved fingers into the class member's vagina and\nanus.\n4. On June 13, 1986 class member 5737, arrested on a misdemeanor, was required to remove\nher clothing and was subjected to a digital cavity search by a female member of the Calumet City\nPolice Department.\nAt least two arrestees (class members 5206 and 6651) were required to sit on a toilet and spread their legs, and\nat least one (class member 5254) was searched in that fashion in the presence of a male officer. At least 27\nwomen arrestees were searched by male officers, including the following examples:\n1. On May 18, 1983 class member 6632's breasts were fondled by a male officer.\n2. On June 27, 1983 a male officer conducted a digital cavity search of class member 5319.\n3. On April 18, 1984, after a female searcher had class member 6470 remove her clothing and\n1215 after the class member refused to squat, two male officers entered *1215 the room and ordered\nthe class member to squat.\n4. On August 30, 1984 a male officer strip searched class member 6697 and ordered her to squat.\n\n5. On September 2, 1984 a male officer, clad in rubber gloves, ran his fingers along the genitals of\nclass member 6789 and conducted a digital cavity search.\n6. On September 4, 1984 a male officer fondled the breasts of class member 6789 and ran his\nfingers along her genitals.\n7. On January 13, 1985 a male officer strip searched class member 5831.\n8. On May 3, 1985 a male officer lifted the breasts of class member 5279 and felt around her\nanus.\n9. On March 19, 1986 a male officer strip searched class member 5305.\n10. On December 21, 1986 class member 5446, arrested for being a minor in a tavern, was\nsearched by a male officer who required her to lift her shirt over her breasts.\n11. On April 29, 1987 a male officer required class member 6448 (13 years of age) to strip to her\nunderwear.\nIt is uncontroverted that the 146 strip searches described in the current submission, as exemplified by the just-\n[8]\ncompleted sampling, took place.  Although Calumet City asserts additional facts concerning only three of the\narrestees that it admits were strip searched, nowhere does it argue or offer any evidence (1) that any searching\nofficer had any antecedent basis for conducting any of the strip searches or (2) that the searches did not in fact\noccur.\nCalumet City did not have a written policy that explicitly outlined the procedures for \"strip searches\" (in the\n[9]\nestablished meaning of that term)  until after this litigation began. Its pre-litigation written policies as to searches\nhad been contained in three Police Department general orders:\n1. General Order 76-3 (adopted in April 1976) and General Order 76-7 (adopted in June 1976)\nhad required that all arrestees be searched but did not provide any explicit procedures for\nconducting searches incident to booking (P.Ex. 6-7).\n2. In June 1984 the Police Department adopted General Order 84-4, giving some more specific\nguidance as to strip searches. Its relevant provisions were these:\n1. Arrestees will immediately be searched when brought into the lockup booking area.\n2. Searches will be conducted by department members of the same sex as the arrestee.\n3. Arrestee will be scanned with a metal detecting device to ensure against concealment of a\nweapon not discovered on the pat down search.\n* * * * * *\n1216 *1216 5. Arrestees will not be subjected to a strip search for any traffic or misdemeanor offense,\nunless specific factors are present which establish reasonable belief that a search will uncover a\nweapon or controlled substance. Strip searches will ordinarily be conducted in one of the lockup\nholding areas out of the view of persons not involved and then only after receiving approval from\nthe Commanding Officer on duty. When a strip search is conducted, it must be so noted on the\narrest ticket.\nNOTE: Discretion and good judgment will be used when conducting a strip search. The arrestee\nwill not be required to remain unclothed any longer than is absolutely necessary. No touching of\nthe body cavities is permitted by department members.\nIf that policy had been implemented in the same spirit in which it appears to have been written, this lawsuit would\nhave had a quite different scope 00 at least prospectively from the time of adoption of General Order 84-4. But\n97\n\nsomewhat unbelievably the Police Department provided no training as to General Order 84-4 00 nor were the\n97\ndispatchers, who routinely conducted searches, even made aware that the order existed. Lacking any definition\nof \"strip search,\" the order was actually understood by high ranking officers of the Police Department to permit\nsearches of breasts and the exterior of the vagina and anus of female arrestees as long as the search did not\nentail the complete removal of their clothing.\nCalumet City did not conform its strip search policy (either written or in practice) to even minimal constitutional\n[10]\nnorms until March 31, 1988 (after this action was filed), when it published General Order 88-1.  That order\ndefines strip searches as:\nhaving an arrested person remove or arrange some or all of his/her clothing so as to permit a\nvisual inspection of the genitals, buttocks, anus, female breasts or undergarments of such\npersons.\nThat order also prohibits the touching of body cavities by department members and requires that any search of a\nbody cavity other than the mouth be performed only with a warrant. It was only after the adoption of that order\nthat many of Calumet City's employees learned for the first time that a strip search included removal or\nrearrangement of \"some or all ... clothing so as to permit a visual inspection\" of an arrestee's private parts.\nAt no time during the class period did Calumet City require those who conducted searches to attend any formal\ntraining on search procedures, even though such training was available. Such minimal training as was given\nabout searches was conducted sporadically on the job, and it did not cover the constitutional limits of search\nprocedures. In sharp contrast, Calumet City did require its employees who were principally involved in conducting\nsearches to attend a 40-hour course in radio operations 00 because the Police Department believed that such\n97\nprocedures could not be learned on the job.\nIn the absence of any training concerning the constitutional limits of their power to search arrestees, members of\nthe Calumet City Police Department routinely conducted strip searches on females arrested for misdemeanor or\n1217 ordinance offenses. As already reflected, some of those searches were conducted by male members *1217 of\n[11]\nthe Police Department,  although most of the searches were conducted by dispatchers (also referred to as\nDesk Clerks or Matrons). Those dispatchers testified to the following:\n1. Phyllis Harrison (\"Harrison\") conducted searches between 1976 until October 1987, requiring\nwomen arrestees to remove their clothes down to their underwear. Harrison would also require\nwomen to remove their underwear if requested by the watch commander. On occasion Harrison\nwould instruct the female arrestee to lift her brassiere, sometimes resulting in exposure of an\n[12]\nunclothed breast.\n2. Anita Pala (\"Pala\") conducted searches from 1974 to 1979 and from 1980 to the present. In\nsearching a female arrested on charges of shoplifting and prostitution, Pala would pat the woman\ndown, require her to empty her pockets and remove her shirt, loosen her brassiere, pull it out and\nshake it, remove her pants and take off her underpants.\n3. Nancy Panozzo (\"Panozzo\") conducted searches from October 1985 to October 1988 in which\nshe routinely required any women arrestee to lift up her blouse and pull her brassiere away from\nher body. About half the time that maneuver would result in exposure of the woman's breast.\nPanozzo also required women to lower their pants and underpants, exposing the pubic area.\n4. Sue Orzel (\"Orzel\"), a dispatcher from 1984 to the present, conducted searches of female\narrestees by requiring each woman to undo or lift her blouse and lift her brassiere. Orzel would\nalso require women to undo their jeans, at which time Orzel would run her hands along the band\nof the woman's underpants.\n5. Patricia Ranachowski (\"Ranachowski\"), a dispatcher since October 1985, routinely required any\nwoman arrestee to lift her blouse and pull her brassiere away from her body. If the woman was\nwearing jeans, Ranachowski would require her to unzip her jeans and roll the waistband down. If\n\nthe woman was wearing a skirt, Ranachowski might require the woman to raise her skirt. When\nrequested by the arresting officer to do a thorough search (in some drug, shoplifting and\nprostitution cases), Ranachowski would require the female arrestee to lower her outer pants and\nunderpants and squat.\n6. Virginia Schweitzer (\"Schweitzer\"), a dispatcher since 1982, had a practice of requiring each\nfemale arrestee to pull down her pants, open her blouse and pull her brassiere (if any) away from\nher body. On occasion Schweitzer would require the female arrestee to lower her pants and squat\nto see if \"anything was kept internally which would then fall out\" (Schweitzer Dep. 14). Schweitzer\nhas performed that type of search for female arrestees arrested for drug offenses as well as for\nretail theft and prostitution.\n7. Sandra Siatta (\"Siatta\"), a dispatcher from January 1979 to about 1985, when requested by an\narresting officer to conduct a \"thorough\" search, would require the female arrestee to remove her\nunderwear and in some cases require the female arrestee to squat (Siatta Dep. 15-16, 19).\n1218 *1218 8. Rita Peralta (\"Peralta\")[13], a dispatcher for an 11-month period in 1984 or 1985,\nroutinely required women arrestees to unzip their jeans and unbutton their blouses. She also\ntestified that she had performed that type of search on women arrested for traffic offenses.\n9. Popovich, who searched \"Doe\" and who has been a dispatcher at Calumet City from 1985,\nroutinely required women arrestees to lift their blouses and brassieres (exposing their breasts)\nand to lower their jeans and underpants to the knees and to lift them back up.\nIn sharp contrast to that practice of routinely strip searching women arrestees, the practice of searching male\narrestees at Calumet City did not involve any removal of clothing or exposure of any private parts unless the\narrestee had been arrested in a drug raid or unless there was a belief that the arrestee was concealing a\nweapon, narcotics or narcotics paraphernalia.\nConstitutional Standard\nPlaintiffs' Section 1983 claim asserts that the entire practice of strip searches as conducted by Calumet City\n[14]\nviolated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment right  to be free from \"unreasonable searches.\" For those searches to\nhave been unreasonable, the arrestees must have had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the areas of their\nbodies that were searched and the searches themselves must have been unreasonable (see Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520, 558, 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 1885, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)).\nUnreasonableness of the Strip Searches\nAs already described in some detail, each search at a minimum included an uncovering of the woman arrestee's\nexternal clothing, usually resulting in the exposure of the arrestee's breasts, buttocks, anus or vagina 00 and most\n97\n[15]\noften a combination of those body parts.  There is simply no question that plaintiffs had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in those private parts. Deeply imbedded in our culture 00 at least since the first telling of\n97\n[16]\nNoah's exposure before his son Ham and his other sons' reaction to Noah's nakedness  00 is the belief that\n97\npeople have a reasonable expectation not to be unclothed involuntarily, to be observed unclothed or to have their\n[17]\n\"private\" parts observed or touched by others. Katz's maxim that \"the Fourth Amendment protects people, not\nplaces\" (389 U.S. at 351, 88 S.Ct. at 511) would have no meaning if people had no right to have their most\nprivate parts free from unreasonable searches.\nAs if it were not clear enough from the common understanding of the nature of our form of government that police\nofficers do not have unlimited power to expose or to inspect the private areas of a citizen's body, ample\nprecedent antedating the class period had made it crystal clear that the Constitution prohibits blanket strip search\n1219 policies. For example, Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 491 (E.D.Wis.1979), aff'd *1219 per curiam by adoption\n\nof the opinion below, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980), held that a \"blanket strip search policy\" of a non-misdemeanor\ntraffic violator:\nwithout probable cause to believe that she was concealing weapons or contraband on her body\nwas a violation of the plaintiff's rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the\n[18]\nU.S. Constitution.\nQuoting from an unpublished oral decision in Sala v. County of Suffolk (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 28, 1978), Tinetti, id. stated\nthat strip searches are:\ndemeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing,\n[19]\nrepulsive, signifying degradation and submission....\nBell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885 also recognized that there is a legitimate privacy interest in not being strip\nsearched, though it also clarified that all strip searches are not unconstitutional per se (id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at\n1884). It explained that the government must have a reasonable justification for conducting such searches (id.)\n(citations omitted):\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nBell's balancing test clearly requires some level of justification for conducting a strip search. Courts examining the\nstrip search issue have found that the \"justification\" element of Bell may range from \"reasonable suspicion\" to\n[20]\n\"probable cause to believe\" that the suspects were in possession of a weapon or contraband.  For example, \nMary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273 (quoting from Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59\nL.Ed.2d 660 (1979) (footnotes and citations omitted)) teaches:\nThe reasonableness standard usually requires, \"at a minimum, that the facts upon which an\nintrusion is based be capable of measurement against `an objective standard,' whether this be\nprobable cause or a less stringent test.\" The more intrusive the search, the closer governmental\nauthorities must come to demonstrating probable cause for believing that the search will uncover\n1220 the objects for which the search is being conducted. Based on these principles, we agree with \n*1220 the district court in Jane Does that ensuring the security needs of the City by strip searching\nplaintiffs-appellees was unreasonable without a reasonable suspicion by the authorities that either\nof the twin dangers of concealing weapons or contraband existed.\nMary Beth G. affirmed Jane Does, which had found the City of Chicago liable under Section 1983 for its strip\nsearch policy before the beginning of the class period here. Like most of the searches at issue here, those in \n[21]\nJane Does involved a \"partial disrobement and visual search.\"  And like the searches here, the central\nproblem with those searches was that there was \"no distinction ... with respect to the reason for which the arrest\nwas made nor the grounds for searching for contraband.\" Jane Does' holding is clear:\nStrip searches for [weapons of contraband] violate the Fourth Amendment if the detainee was not\narrested for reasonable grounds to believe that she had committed an offense related to the\nnature of the items being searched for.\nIn fact, the only exception that was considered by the District Court there and that was echoed by our Court of\nAppeals was that a strip search may be conducted (id.; Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1271 n. 7, 1273):\nif a female is arrested on reasonable grounds to believe that she is involved with narcotics, or on\nperhaps some other reasonable grounds to believe she has committed a crime the fruits of which\nmight be located in her body.\n\nFrom a time well before the class period began, Jane Does and all the other strip search cases have universally\ndemonstrated that one element must be present for a strip search to be held reasonable: Police officers must\nhave some level of particularized justification to strip search an individual arrestee. Whether the proper standard\nis probable cause or some lesser form of particularized belief (an issue that need not be resolved on the\nundisputed facts in this case), the first step in the inquiry is to determine whether the members of the Calumet\nCity Police Department had any justification to believe that the women they searched were in possession of any\nweapon or contraband that would be revealed only by the scope of the search conducted. And it is unnecessary\nto pause even for a moment on that preliminary inquiry, for Calumet City has failed to offer any evidence that its\nemployees had any particular knowledge at the time of the searches that would give them any basis for such a\n[22]\nbelief.  In fact, the testimony of the dispatchers reveals that neither they nor any other officers were required to\nmake such a determination before conducting a strip search, except in the case of male arrestees.\nIn summary, Calumet City cannot justify the broad pattern of strip searches that were conducted without any level\nof belief that the women making up the plaintiff class were in possession of a weapon or contraband. Hence the\n1221 searches at issue *1221 were unreasonable and thus unconstitutional.[23]\nCalumet City's Liability.\nMonell v. Department of Social Services of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037, 56 L.Ed.2d 611\n(1978) teaches that Calumet City is liable under Section 1983 only if it caused the constitutional deprivations\nalleged here:\n[I]t is when execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by\nthose whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the\ngovernment as an entity is responsible under § 1983.\nThough such causation is frequently shown by evidence of a municipality's formal legislative act (an ordinance)\nor its adoption of an express policy, the absence of such a formal action requiring strip searches is not at all fatal\nto plaintiffs' claim. Monell, id. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-36 simultaneously made it clear that a municipality can\nbe held liable even when such a widespread practice or policy \"has not received formal approval through the\nbody's official decisionmaking channels\" (see also Sims v. Mulcahy, 902 F.2d 524, 542 (7th Cir.1990)).\nCalumet City's consistent (though unwritten) practice before 1984 is confirmed by the strikingly similar testimony\nof the dispatchers 00 evidence in every material way corroborated by the testimony of the arrestees. No significant\n97\n[24]\nchange in that practice occurred until after this lawsuit was filed.  There is no doubt whatever that Calumet\nCity had an effective, though unwritten, practice that consistently called for and imposed indiscriminately\nadministered strip searches.\nAs Section 1983 jurisprudence has developed, however, that universally practiced deprivation of constitutional\nrights by a municipality's employees may not necessarily trigger municipal liability in the Rule 56 context\npresented here. Jett v. Dallas Independent School District, 491 U.S. 701, 109 S.Ct. 2702, 2723, 105 L.Ed.2d 598\n(1989) (citations omitted, emphasis in original) reconfirmed the most recent articulation of the operative standard:\nAs with other questions of state law relevant to the application of federal law, the identification of\nthose officials whose decisions represent the official policy of the local governmental unit is itself a\nlegal question to be resolved by the trial judge before the case is submitted to the jury. Reviewing\nthe relevant legal materials, including state and local positive law, as well \"`custom or usage'\nhaving the force of law,\" ... the trial judge must identify those officials or governmental bodies who\nspeak with final policymaking authority for the local governmental actor concerning the action\nalleged to have caused the particular constitutional or statutory violation at issue. Once those\nofficials who have the power to make official policy on a particular issue have been identified, it is\nfor the jury to determine whether their decisions have caused the deprivation of rights at issue by\n1222 policies which affirmatively command that it occur, ... or by acquiescence *1222 in a longstanding\n\npractice or custom which constitutes the \"standard operating procedure\" of the local governmental\nentity....\nIn this instance the relevant final policymaker was Calumet City's Police Chief Shutoski 00 and P.Mem. 7 n. 10\n97\ncharacterizes him as having denied under oath \"that he consciously approved Calumet City's strip search policy.\"\n[25]\n At the summary judgment stage, that is enough to create a genuine factual issue. This Court may not ignore\nthat denial by labeling it as inherently incredible in light of the overwhelming evidence of what was actually going\non 00 for a policymaker's negligent administration or even ostrich-like blindness does not rise to the level of a\n97\n\"decision,\" as called for by Jett.\nBut Calumet City cannot escape constitutional liability quite so easily, just by pointing to the alleged ignorance on\nthe part of the man in charge as to his department's pervasive practices. It still remains true beyond peradventure\nthat one or both of two types of constitutional failures by Calumet City itself was or were the primary cause of the\nwide pattern of unconstitutional searches proved here:\n1. Whatever policy Calumet City did have was seriously deficient in constitutional terms.\n2. Calumet City failed to train its officers adequately in the respects critical to this case.\nGibson v. City of Chicago, 910 F.2d 1510, 1521 (7th Cir.1990) teaches that the analyses under either an\n\"inadequacy of policy\" or a \"failure to train\" theory are identical. Like plaintiffs, this Court will focus its discussion\non the latter theory (failure to train), because Calumet City's failure to train its employees as to the constitutional\nlimits of their power to conduct strip searches was unquestionably the legal cause of the injuries complained of\nhere.\nIn that respect City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 389, 109 S.Ct. at 1204 identifies as a predicate for municipal liability\nunder Section 1983:\nwhere a municipality's failure to train its employees in a relevant respect evidences a \"deliberate\nindifference\" to the rights of its inhabitants....\nCity of Canton, id. at 390 & n. 10, 109 S.Ct. at 1205 & n. 10 (citation and other footnote omitted) explains that\nsuch \"deliberate indifference\" is evident when the need for training is \"obvious\":\n[I]t may happen that in the light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need\nfor more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of\nconstitutional rights, that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been\ndeliberately indifferent to the need.10 In that event, the failure to provide proper training may be\nfairly be said to represent a policy for which the city is responsible, and for which the city may be\nheld liable if it actually causes injury.\n10. For example, city policymakers know to a moral certainty that their police officers will be\nrequired to arrest fleeing felons. The city has armed its officers with firearms, in part to allow them\nto accomplish this task. Thus, the need to train officers in constitutional limitations on the use of\ndeadly force can be said to be \"so obvious\" that the failure to do so could properly be\ncharacterized as \"deliberate indifference\" to constitutional rights.\nIt could also be that the police, in exercising their discretion, so often violate constitutional rights\nthat the need for training must have been so plainly obvious to the city policymakers, who,\nnevertheless, are \"deliberately indifferent\" to the need.\nIt is painfully obvious (and was so substantially before the class period began) that there was a need for training\nin the constitutional limits of strip searches. Several factors singly compel that conclusion 00 and in combination\n97\nthey serve to bury Calumet City in this case.\n1223 *1223 For one thing, in response to the public outcry following the widely-publicized disclosure of Chicago's\n[26]\nblanket search policy, the Illinois legislature changed the state law governing post-arrest searches.  There is\n\nno need to equate every aspect of the Illinois statutory provision to the Fourth Amendment standards regarding\n[27]\nsearches 00 it is enough that the central thrust of the statute was to prohibit unjustified strip search policies.  It\n97\nwas that aspect of the statute that coincides with Fourth Amendment standards and that Calumet City blithely\nignored.\nSecond, Calumet City failed to modify or implement any policy as to the constitutional limits of strip searches\neven after (1) Tinetti's 1980 declaration by our Court of Appeals of the unconstitutionality of a blanket policy that\nall nonmisdemeanor traffic violators be searched and (2) the 1982 declaration in Jane Does (also antedating the\nclass period in this case) that Chicago's strip search policy was unconstitutional. It is of course true that Jane\nDoes was an opinion at the District Court level and that its affirmance in Mary Beth G. came in 1983, after the\ncommencement of the class period (although that was still several years before this lawsuit was brought). If Jane\nDoes had been the only straw then in the constitutional wind, Calumet City might have had a tenable basis for\narguing that its liability should have been triggered only after the constitutional lesson had been driven home in \n[28]\nMary Beth G.  But that is not at all the case 00 instead the situation is strikingly parallel to that in Coleman v.\n97\nMcLaren, 631 F.Supp. 763 (N.D.Ill.1986),aff'd in relevant part sub nom. Hamer v County of Lake, 819 F.2d 1362\n(7th Cir.1987), which by analogy confirms Calumet City's liability to all class members victimized by its strip\n[29]\nsearches, because the constitutional principle was well established before the class period began.\nFinally, Calumet City knew that its dispatchers were routinely conducting searches, and it should have been clear\nto the city that unless strip searches were limited there was a high probability that unconstitutional searches\nwould result. Calumet City denies that the need for training in this area was obvious by arguing that the case here\nis similar to East v. City of Chicago, 719 F.Supp. 683 (N.D.Ill.1989), where this Court held that there was no\n1224 obvious need for the City to train its officers *1224 to recognize the medical symptoms of drugs taken in non-user\n[30]\nquantities.  That distorts the analysis in East, which (id. at 694 (emphasis added), quoting City of Canton, 489\nU.S. at 390 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. at 1205 n. 10 (footnote omitted)) also held that \"failure to train its officers in the use\nof force\" was actionable:\nBecause the appropriate use of force is a problem regularly encountered in police work, every\nofficer must be trained to know when and how much force to use in the variety of taxing situations\nhe or she is likely to face. Surely the need to provide such training is \"`so obvious' that failure to\ndo so could properly be characterized as `deliberate indifference' to constitutional rights.\"\nMoreover, East, id. 00 in a holding parallel to that announced here 00 also stated that the other claim of the plaintiff\n97 97\nthere (involving the nonexistence of training to recognize plaintiff's drug ingestion) could have been actionable on\n\"deliberate indifference\" grounds:\n[i]f City had knowledge of such past occurrences with enough frequency to call for training\nordinary officers in that respect 00 and if it failed to respond to that need....\n97\nCompare Gibson, 910 F.2d at 1522 & n. 20.\nIn contrast to the \"remote\" possibility in East of an arrestee's large quantity drug ingestion, it is highly probable (if\nnot dead certain) that police officers are regularly called upon to consider whether and when to conduct strip\nsearches on arrestees. DiLoreto v. Borough of Oaklyn, 744 F.Supp. 610, 623-24 (D.N.J.1990) has recently\nexamined that precise issue. There the plaintiff was arrested for questioning for involvement in a suspected car\ntheft. At the station a female police officer was ordered to observe the arrestee as she urinated. That observation,\ncharacterized as a \"strip search,\" was conducted without \"any particularized suspicion toward plaintiff\" (id. at\n621). It was held to be an unconstitutional search caused by the unwritten policy of the police department to\nobserve all female arrestees visually while they urinated (id. at 623). DiLoreto, id. at 623-24 then resolved the\nfinal question, which centered on whether the need for training regarding strip searches was so \"obvious\" that the\nBorough's failure to correct that inadequacy rose to the level of \"deliberate indifference\" under the City of Canton\ntest:\nAs can be seen from the large number of cases discussing this issue, strip searching by police ...\nis not an uncommon occurrence. It is something that police officers must confront daily and an\n\narea in which they should receive training. Police officers should be aware of the limits placed on\ntheir actions by the Constitution. The Borough has a responsibility to implement policies that are\nconsistent with the Constitution and to train its officers accordingly. It is not enough for the\nBorough to say that it is not liable because it does not have a formal policy. Having no policy is\nitself a policy, and in this case, it is an unconstitutional policy. By not creating and implementing a\npolicy and not training its employees regarding accompanying detainees to the bathroom, the\nBorough has expressed deliberate indifference to the fourth amendment rights of detainees....\nIt cannot be gainsaid that Calumet City, like the Borough of Oaklyn, knew that its officers were confronting the\ndaily opportunity to conduct strip searches. If anything beyond common sense and experience were needed to\nbuttress that conclusion, the added ingredient is more than amply supplied by the number of arrestees who have\n1225 come forward with evidence of Calumet *1225 City's strip searches here. It must be viewed as having been\npainfully obvious to Calumet City that there was an unfulfilled need for training in the constitutional contours of\nthe dispatchers' lawful power to strip search.\nDespite that degree of obviousness, Calumet City did not respond to the need for training as to strip searches\neither with such training or with a promulgated policy. Even though Calumet City saw fit to provide a formal 40-\nhour course in radio procedures 00 because operating a radio \"just isn't picked up that easy by one person telling\n97\nanother\" (Shutoski Dep. 18) 00 it failed utterly to provide any training, formal or informal, as to the constitutional\n97\nlimits of strip searches before this lawsuit began. Many dispatchers had received informal training on the\nperformance of strip searches, but they were never told of the lawful limits of such searches. Before 1984\nCalumet City had \"no written policy, regulation, order, or procedure addressing [post-arrest searches]\" (D.Mem. 6,\nemphasis in original). Then the 1984 regulation did not begin to fill the vacuum: Calumet City did not promulgate\nit to the dispatchers, and even if it had distributed the order, even the leadership of the department believed that it\nauthorized searches of \"breasts, vagina, and anus of female arrestees\" as long as all clothing was not removed\n[31]\nsimultaneously (Backlin Dep. 19, 26).  Instead the first clear policy and training that informed the dispatchers\nof the constitutional limits of strip searches came into being only on March 31, 1988 00 after the commencement\n97\nof this action.\nNor is there the slightest doubt as to the causal nexus between Calumet City's failure to train its employees and\nthe constitutional violations suffered by plaintiffs. Here the searches to which plaintiffs were subjected were\nneither isolated occurrences nor symptoms of a minor weakness in a particular officer's ability to remember her\ntraining. They were rather part of a consistent pattern of behavior that simply would not have occurred in the\ndepartmentwide manner that it did if the training had been adequate (see City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 391, 109\nS.Ct. at 1205). No testimony suggests that the searches were conducted with any understanding other that they\nwere authorized. There is an uncanny similarity among all the dispatchers' testimony concerning not only their\npractices but also their training (or more accurately in this respect, their lack of training). There is simply no\npossibility that any reasonable person could reach any conclusions other than (1) that Calumet City was\n\"deliberately indifferent\" to the need to train its officers in the constitutional limits of strip searches and (2) that\nhad the officers been so trained, the pattern of searches would not have taken on the color of a practice that was\n[32]\nso uniformly unconstitutional.\nConclusion\nThere is no genuine issue of material fact as to the liability of Calumet City to the members of the plaintiff class,\nwho are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law on the issue of such liability. This action is set for a status\nhearing on December 26, 1990 at 9 a.m. to discuss further proceedings in this action.\n[1] On October 1, 1987 this Court certified that class pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. (\"Rule\") 23(b)(3) (see 707 F.Supp.\n343, 345 (N.D.Ill.1989)). After some consideration of whether a different starting date ought to define class\nparticipation (see id. (issued Feb. 6, 1989), followed by a July 17, 1989 unpublished slip opinion and an opinion\nissued Sept. 19, 1989 (reported at 128 F.R.D. 93)), this Court returned to the original certification date (see id. at\n96, an opinion issued on Sept. 22, 1989). Both to avoid needless repetition and to minimize any awkwardness in\n\nlocution, the rest of this opinion will simply speak of \"plaintiffs\" collectively, referring to the class only where\nnecessary to the substantive discussion.\n[2] Plaintiffs have also sued Calumet City's former police chief James Shutoski and Sandra Popovich\n(\"Popovich,\" a police department dispatcher), but only Calumet City's liability is now at issue.\n[3] Rule 56 principles impose on the movant the burden of establishing the lack of a genuine issue of material fact\n(Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552-53, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). For that\npurpose this Court is called on to draw all \"reasonable inferences, not every conceivable inference\" in the light\nmost favorable to the nonmovant00in this case Calumet City (DeValk Lincoln Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 811\n97\nF.2d 326, 329 (7th Cir. 1987)). Although they have cited incorrectly to the subparagraphs of this District Court's\nGeneral Rule (\"GR\") 12(m) and 12(n) requiring factual statements in support of and in opposition to Rule 56\nmotions, both sides have tendered such statements (cited \"P. 12(m) 00\" and \"D. 12(n) 00\" respectively).\n97 97\n[4] In support of the current motion, counsel for the plaintiff class has tendered verified statements from 117 class\nmembers who were the subjects of a total of 146 strip searches. That does not of course narrow either the class\ndefinition or the class membership to those 117 women.\n[5]Jane Does v. City of Chicago, No. 79 C 789, slip op. (N.D.Ill. Jan. 12, 1982). That opinion is available on\nLEXIS but, as was the practice in 1982 for opinions retrieved via LEXIS, was never paginated. And because the \nJane Does court file is in record storage, the paginated slip opinion is temporarily unavailable to this Court.\nHowever, it is a short opinion, so that this opinion's citation without reference to a particular page should not\npresent any problem in identification. Chicago's strip search policy addressed by Jane Does was widely\npublicized: It was the subject of a week long series on WMAQ-TV and, under the banner headline of \"Probe\nStrip-Search of Women by Police,\" covered all of page one of the Chicago Sun-Times on February 14, 1979\n(P.Ex. 1). It also received coverage in Newsweek on February 26, 1979 (P.Ex. 2) and a full page in Time on\nMarch 19, 1979 (P.Ex. 3 at 36).\n[6] [Footnote by this Court] Other subsections of the same section defined \"strip search\" and established a whole\nset of procedures to be followed in conducting such searches.\n[7] To protect their identities, the class members have been referred to in the class' evidentiary submission by\nnumbers rather than names.\n[8] Calumet City's only response to the overwhelming evidence offered by plaintiffs is the testimony of three\ndispatchers that they did not strip search all categories of arrestees (D. 12(n) 3-4). At most that would show that\nnot all persons searched by those three dispatchers and who were in one of the categories excluded from such\nsearches by the dispatchers may have been strip searched. But Calumet City does not use that evidence to\ncounter the specific complaints, and its failure constitutes an admission of plaintiffs' evidence of all the searches\nalleged (Skagen v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 910 F.2d 1498, 1500 (7th Cir.1990) and GR 12(n)).\n[9] This Court includes within the term \"strip search\" any exposure or observation of a portion of a person's body\nwhere that person has a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" (Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 360, 88 S.Ct.\n507, 516, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1267) (footnote omitted)\ndescribed Chicago's \"strip search\" practice as an unwritten policy that required a female arrestee to: \n1. lift her blouse or sweater and to unhook and lift her brassiere to allow visual inspection of the breast area, to\nreplace these articles of clothing and then\n2. to pull up her skirt or dress or to lower her pants and pull down any undergarments, to squat two or three times\nfacing the detention aide and to bend over at the waist to permit visual inspection of the vaginal and anal area.\nThat coincides in nearly every material element with the practice in Calumet City. Any minor variations that took\nplace from arrestee to arrestee or from searching officer to searching officer do not affect the legal consequences\nas discussed later in this opinion.\n[10] General Order 87-1 (adopted on May 22, 1987) had said (as part of its opening Section I, labeled\n\"PURPOSE\") that it defined \"strip search\" and \"search\" as well as some other terms. But its Section II (labeled\n\n\"DEFINITIONS\") contained no such definitions at all, instead using those terms without definition. All that was\nprovided by way of substantive content was the \"NOTE\" that began \"Discretion and good judgment ...,\" quoted\ntwo paragraphs back in the text of this opinion. But even if General Order 87-1 had been more informative than it\nwas as to the meaning of \"strip searches\" and the standards to be followed in conducting them, what was more\nsignificant was the fact that, as with the previous General Order, the dispatchers were not even made aware of\nthis new General Order. And as before, even the senior members of the Police Department still believed that the\nterm \"strip search\" in the new General Order did not include any search that involved only a partial disrobing of\nthe arrestee.\n[11] Calumet City offered proof that some of the officers of its Police Department did not conduct such searches,\nbut such evidence casts no doubt on the class members' testimony that some other male members of the\ndepartment participated in such searches. At most the testimony shows that only the testifying officers did not\nconduct strip searches of female arrestees. Furthermore, even if only females had conducted the searches, that\nfact would not have rendered the searches constitutional. Calumet City's minor quibbles with the descriptions of\nindividual searches does not change the overall effect of its unconstitutional policy (or failure to train) that\nresulted in routine strip searches (see, e.g., Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1267 n. 4, which declined to take into\nconsideration the varying accounts of the location in which the searches were conducted, because the overall\npolicy as described by the defendant was unconstitutional).\n[12] Harrison also testified that she did not strip search juveniles or those arrested for disorderly conduct or traffic\nviolations.\n[13] Calumet City argues that Peralta \"has demonstrated extreme bias against\" the Police Department. If any\nsuch bias in fact existed and if this Court were to ignore Peralta's testimony entirely, the absence of that\ntestimony would not change the outcome in this case. But Calumet City's charge that bias affected Peralta's\ntestimony is not supported in the record. Calumet City offered no evidence to counter her testimony, and the\noverwhelming evidence from other dispatchers and from 117 persons in the plaintiff class fully corroborate\nPeralta's testimony.\n[14] As always, this opinion adheres to the conventional and convenient (though technically imprecise) practice of\nreferring to the Fourth Amendment's underlying Bill of Rights provision (which of course imposes limitations only\non the federal government) rather than to the Fourteenth Amendment (which applies to state actors and has been\nconstrued to embody such Bill of Rights guaranties).\n[15] To the extent that the evidence so frequently discloses even more egregious invasions of plaintiffs' persons,\na fortiori reasoning applies.\n[16]Genesis 9:20-23.\n[17] It is scarcely to be considered an accident that long before our constitutional case law began to speak in\nterms of privacy, it was already an established part of our language to refer to \"private parts\" as denoting \"the\nexternal genital and excretory organs\" (Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1645 (1976), setting out\ndefinition d(3) of the noun \"part\").\n[18] [Footnote by this Court] Although Tinetti involved a search of non-misdemeanor traffic violators, there is no\nquestion that its reasoning applies to all blanket search policies 00 such as the practice in Calumet City 00 that\n97 97\nmake no distinctions among types of crimes or that fail to require any level of belief that a particular arrestee is in\npossession of a weapon or contraband. Tinetti, id. at 490 states plainly: \nThe intrusion on one's personal dignity occasioned by such searches requires that some justifiable basis exists.\n[19] [Footnote by this Court] In like vein, a somewhat later opinion in John Does 1-100 v. Boyd, 613 F.Supp.\n1514, 1522 & n. 11 (D.Minn.1985) found a blanket search policy unconstitutional and stated: \nThe Court finds that the Dakota County strip search procedure, which is imposed across the board upon the\nwhole spectrum of individuals in the community, young and old, male and female, is a dehumanizing, indecent,\ndistasteful, and outrageous practice.11\n\n11. One commentator has described the experience as a \"visual rape.\" Shuldiner, Visual Rape: A Look at the\nDubious Legality of Strip Searches, 13 J.Marsh.L.Rev. 278 (1980).\n[20] See, e.g., Tinetti, 479 F.Supp. at 491 (requiring probable cause in non-misdemeanor traffic cases) and a\nnumber of other cases citing Tinetti: Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th Cir. 1984) (strip search of a traffic\noffender with \"no circumstances here indicating [arrestee] might possess either a weapon or drugs\" was\nunconstitutional); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (\"arrestees charged with\nminor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion that the\nindividual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband\"); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir.1981),\nholding such a search unconstitutional because the officer had \"no cause\" to believe that the detainee had a\nweapon or contraband and stating: \nAn indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied to detainees ... cannot be constitutionally justified simply on\nthe basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.\n[21] Calumet City mistakenly attempts to distinguish the facts of Jane Does from those here by contending that\nthe City of Chicago had a written policy. In fact, no mention was made by either the District Court or our Court of\nAppeals of any such written policy. Instead both courts quote not from a written policy, but from a summary of\nChicago's effective policy contained in the defendant's memorandum. Indeed, there was some dispute as to\nChicago's actual practice (see Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1267 n. 4.).\n[22] Calumet City urges that plaintiffs have failed to show for each specific search that Calumet City's officers did\nnot have a \"reasonable belief that the traffic arrestees could or may have been concealing weapons or controlled\nsubstances\" (D.Mem. 7). That argument is truly empty 00 it wholly ignores the fact that plaintiff class has shown\n97\nthat Calumet City had an indiscriminate and routine practice of conducting strip searches, a showing that is\nclearly sufficient under City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1205 n. 10, 103 L.Ed.2d\n412 (1989) to prove the city's liability. Calumet City has failed utterly to rebut that proof and cannot prevent a\nfinding of summary judgment against it (see Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. at 2552-53). At most, if it\nbelieved that any specific searches or classes of searches had a reasonable antecedent justification, Calumet\nCity could have offered proof that the subjects of those searches should be excluded from the class, but it has\nfailed to do that either.\n[23] Even if Calumet City were to offer evidence that in retrospect might have given an officer some basis for\nconducting a particular strip search, it cannot justify post-hoc an unreasonable intrusion without showing that\neach officer involved had such a reasonable basis at the time of the search (see Katz, 389 U.S. at 359, 88 S.Ct.\nat 515 (citation omitted)). Of course it would be possible for a department's procedures to give guidelines for such\na belief 00 for example, that a suspect in a violent crime could reasonably be suspected to possess a weapon 00\n97 97\nbut in the absence of any such specific policy and given the existence of a pattern of searches that clearly did not\ndistinguish among any of the arrestees, Calumet City cannot now manufacture bases in an effort to legitimize the\nstrip searches that were inflicted on plaintiffs.\n[24] Indeed, even after 1984 Calumet City's written policy was understood to allow strip searches so long as no\ncomplete disrobement occurred and, even after 1987, to allow such searches so long as the search was\nconducted by a person of the same sex. Even worse, it seems most likely that those pieces of paper were not the\neffective policy of the Police Department: They were not given to those who routinely performed searches, nor\nwas there any training regarding them. But because this opinion focuses on a \"failure to train\" theory, it is not\nnecessary to address that last question.\n[25] This Court has reviewed Chief Shutoski's deposition, not only at the page cited for that proposition (Dep. 50)\nbut in the entire section dealing with that topic. In candor, plaintiffs give his statement more credit than it deserves\nin that respect 00 but this opinion will ascribe that value to his testimony purely arguendo. As it turns out, Calumet\n97\nCity cannot escape liability on that basis anyway.\n[26] Many of the municipalities in the Calumet City area quickly changed their official procedures to match that\nchange in Illinois law (P.Mem. 14).\n\n[27] Calumet City argues (D.Mem. 2) that plaintiffs' case is mistakenly based on a violation of an Illinois statute\nand not on a violation of the federal Constitution. That contention misses the point that the state statute was\nenacted in response to Chicago's policy that was declared unconstitutional in federal terms. Thus the violation\nalleged in this action 00 the blanket search policy 00 is addressed by both the Illinois statute and the Fourth\n97 97\nAmendment. Moreover, the State's response to Chicago's policy was only one factor that put Calumet City on\nnotice that blanket strip search policies were unconstitutional. If Calumet City were arguing instead that it had\nmerely failed to implement all the procedural requirements of the Illinois statute, it would have a point to the\nextent that those requirements did more than mirror the federal constitutional demands. But when Calumet City\nwholly failed to implement the most basic constitutional proscription against routine blanket strip searches, its\neffort to distinguish between state and federal law is simply off the mark.\n[28] In that event the earliest group of class members, as the class is now certified, might be deprived of any\nrecovery for the violation of their constitutional rights.\n[29] This Court's opinion in Coleman, 631 F.Supp. at 765, 767 held that the Section 1983 claim of plaintiffs there\nwas frivolous in light of existing Supreme Court precedent that had been further explicated in a district court case\nthat paralleled Coleman (Hamer v. Anderson, 594 F.Supp. 561 (N.D.Ill.1984)). Coleman, id. at 765 viewed the\ndistrict court opinion in Hamer not as controlling precedent, but as an \"element in the equation\" showing that the\nexisting law was unquestionably clear as of the date of Hamer. That analysis was upheld on appeal, 819 F.2d at\n1368-69 (and see the affirmance on a second appeal, 871 F.2d 58, 59 (7th Cir.1989)). In like fashion, Does broke\nno new ground but rather amplified the then existing legal precedent of Bell, Tinetti and Logan to the point that it\nwas unquestionably clear by the beginning of the class period that the Fourth Amendment requires antecedent\njustification for strip searches.\n[30] Calumet City labels that case and the one here as \"needs of prisoners\" cases in a supposed contrast to an\n\"excessive force\" case (see, e.g., Kerr v. City of West Palm Beach, 875 F.2d 1546 (11th Cir.1989)). That position\nis myopic (or astigmatic) in the extreme 00 it totally mischaracterizes this Court's decision in East. It also misses\n97\nthe main point of Kerr, id. at 1556: \nIn City of Canton, the Supreme Court recognized that the frequency of constitutional violations may, in itself,\nprovide sufficient circumstantial evidence that a municipality has chosen to allow its officers to act without\nadequate training.\n[31] Those same problems prevented the 1987 regulation from having any positive effect.\n[32] Of course the result is not altered by the possibility that some searches may have gone beyond what might\nhave been Calumet City's routine unconstitutional strip search. Any such search that may have become\nunusually abusive was already unconstitutional and was thus also the natural result of a policy that failed to\nrecognize minimal constitutional limits.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

That single standard for each state would be the one drawn from its limitations period covering\nclaims that were described in the Wilson opinion by using a number of variants of the same\n344 concept 00 \"a general remedy for injuries to personal *344 rights,\" \"claims for personal injuries,\"\n97\n[1]\n\"general personal injury actions, sounding in tort\" and \"personal injury actions.\"\nThis Court, confronted like others with the task of applying Wilson to Illinois-based Section 1983 claims, had\ninitially made what seemed a natural assumption that the Wilson-mandated approach would bring the Illinois\n[2]\n\"damages for an injury to the person\" statute (Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 110, ¶ 13-202 [\"Section 13-202\"]) into play.  But\nwithin a few months after Wilson, this Court was met with a submission by a perceptive lawyer who had been\nwilling to challenge that assumption as perhaps natural in surface terms but nonetheless wrong, and who backed\n[3]\nthe challenge up with unchallengeable authority.\nThat presentation led to this Court's opinion in Shorters v. City of Chicago, 617 F.Supp. 661 (N.D.Ill.1985). There\nthis Court reached the conclusion, for what it then believed 00 and still believes 00 unassailable reasons, that the \n97 97\nWilson approach commands application of the Illinois five-year general residual statute of limitations (Ill.Rev.Stat.\nch. 110, ¶ 13-205 [\"Section 13-205\"]) and not Section 13-202's two-year limitations period. This opinion will not\nrepeat the already-published Shorters analysis, except to restate the surprising but incontrovertible discovery that\n00 under an unbroken line of Illinois case law 00 Section 13-202 is not at all a general statute covering a spectrum\n97 97\nof tort claims comparable to the wide swath embraced by Section 1983 actions, but is rather far more limited in its\nscope.\nNot long after Shorters the Wilson question came, as it was bound to, before our Court of Appeals in Anton v.\nLehpamer, 787 F.2d 1141 (7th Cir.1986). But in Anton the Court of Appeals concentrated exclusively on (1) the\n\nquestion of Wilson's retroactivity and (2) the related question of a window to cover the situation of litigants who\nhad in the past been entitled to rely on the Court of Appeals' decision in Beard v. Robinson, 563 F.2d 331 (7th\nCir.1977) (Beard had applied the same five-year statute this Court later found applicable in Shorters, though on a\ndifferent analytical theory).\nAnton made the same facile (and natural) assumption this Court had made pre-Shorters: It proceeded on the\nunexamined premise that the two-year \"injury to the person\" statute applied, and it took the analysis from there.\nIndeed, all Anton voiced as to the applicable statute was a conclusory statement of that premise, 787 F.2d at\n1142 (footnote quoting Section 13-202 omitted):\nMore than four years after Mr. Anton filed suit, the Supreme Court held that, in all states, the most\nanalogous statute of limitations for all section 1983 actions is the state's personal injury statute of\nlimitations. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985). In Illinois, the\nstatute of limitations for personal injury actions is two years. See Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 110, ¶ 13-202\n(1983).\nSince Anton the substantive question has remained unexamined by our Court of Appeals 00 so far as this Court\n97\ncan tell from its weekly reading of that court's slip opinions, the argument as to the nongenerality of Section\n13-202 that this Court found both impeccable and persuasive in Shorters has never come before the Court of\nAppeals.\nFaced with that situation and compelled in this case to decide the Section 1983 statute of limitations question in\nthe context of certifying the plaintiff class, this Court resolved the matter by a conditional certification. Practical\n345 problems posed by the discovery process meant that the class period could be contracted 00 if necessary 00 but \n97 97\n*345 could not conveniently be expanded in the future. This Court therefore settled on the five-year statute that it\ncontinues to believe called for by the Wilson-Shorters analysis, while at the same time cautioning the class\nmembers that a shorter period might prove applicable. As stated in the December 15, 1987 notice to class\nmembers that this Court approved (emphasis in original):\nThis letter is being sent to you because court records show that you were arrested on a\nmisdemeanor or ordinance violation charge in Calumet City, Illinois after April 16, 1982.\nA lawsuit pending in federal court in Chicago may affect you. The name of the case is Jane Doe et\nal. v. Calumet City, et al., No. 87 C 3594. One claim in the case is that women have been\nsubjected to illegal searches involving the removal of clothing after being arrested in Calumet City,\nIllinois.\nOn October 1, 1987, United States District Judge Milton Shadur ordered that the case could\nproceed as a class action for all women who had been arrested on a misdemeanor or ordinance\nviolation charge in Calumet City, Illinois after April 16, 1982. Further proceedings in the case may\nlimit the class to women who were arrested after September 4, 1985.\nNow the Supreme Court has again spoken definitively 00 and this time unanimously 00 to the Section 1983\n97 97\nlimitations question, in order to resolve the disparate readings that had been given Wilson by the courts around\nthe country. Though Owens v. Okure, ___ U.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989) should of course be\nread in full, Justice Marshall stated the Court's conclusion early and simply (id. at ___, 109 S.Ct. at 575-76):\nWe hold that the residual or general personal injury statute of limitations applies.\nAnd Owens' extended analysis (id. at ___ -___, 109 S.Ct. at 575-82) makes it crystal clear that in a state such as\nIllinois, whose statute that speaks in part of \"injury to the person\" has not been applied by the Illinois courts as a\n\"general personal injury statute\" but rather as one that omits major areas of the much broader coverage provided\nby Section 1983, the relevant statute is its residual one 00 in this instance Section 13-205.\n97\nTo this Court, Owens has clearly vindicated the research presented to this Court early on by Mr. Flaxman and\nfound wholly persuasive for the reasons discussed in Shorters, 617 F.Supp. at 662-66. No disrespect to Anton or\n(of course) to our Court of Appeals is intended 00 that court, like this one, simply dealt with the grist that had been\n97\n\nproffered for its mill by the litigants. But the assumption there tendered to the Court of Appeals as to the nature of\nthe Illinois Section 13-202 two-year statute, and accepted by the Court of Appeals without further examination\n(naturally enough, given the statute's wording), was simply wrong. This Court therefore reconfirms the longer five-\nyear period of class certification, based on the application of Section 13-205, that has previously been made in\nthis case on a conditional basis.\n[1] That general rubric was found the one best fitted to the wide sweep of claims that have been found embraced\nwithin Section 1983.\n[2] Depending on whether one's orientation is literary or political, that assumption could reflect either the Gertrude\nStein syndrome (\"A rose is a rose is a rose\") or President Bush's tax (or non-tax) policy (\"If it walks like a duck,\nquacks like a duck ...\").\n[3] By sheer coincidence that same lawyer, Kenneth Flaxman, Esq., is counsel for the plaintiff class here.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The defendants are the City of\n            Calumet City and its former police chief James Shutowski.\n                     On December 12, 1990, the Court granted plaintiffs’\n            motion for summary judgment and entered a finding of\n            liability against Calumet City.\n                     On January 6, 1992, the Court found that class\n            members have received the best notice practicable, as\n            required by Rule 23(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n            Procedure and that class counsel’s efforts to communicate\n\n            with class members have satisfied the requirements of the\n            Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n                     Following the identification of all class members,\n            the parties have worked to quantify the amount of damages\n            that, in light of the district court’s finding of liability,\n            would be due to each class member.  In making these judg-\n            ments, counsel have been guided by decisions of the United\n            States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit setting\n            strict rules on the amount of recoverable damages in strip\n            search cases.\n                     Following their evaluation of the claim of each\n            class member, counsel for the parties have agreed to avoid\n            the uncertainty, delay, distraction, and expense of further\n            litigation by compromising all claims at issue in accordance\n            with the monetary settlement described below.\n            MONETARY SETTLEMENT\n                     To resolve all claims at issue in this case, in-\n            cluding but not limited to claims for compensatory and\n            punitive damages, and claims for attorneys’ fees and\n            expenses, the parties have agreed to a settlement of all\n            claims at issue in the case.  With respect to the claims\n            asserted on behalf of the class, the plaintiff class has\n            agreed to waive its right to individual damage trials.  The\n            defendants have agreed to waive their right to appeal from\n            the district court’s finding of liability and defendant\n            Calumet City has agreed to the immediate entry of a consent\n            judgment in favor of the plaintiff class in the amount of\n                                        -2-\n\n            $6,013,000 (six million thirteen thousand dollars).\n            Attorneys fees and expenses will be paid from this common\n            fund, in an amount to be set by the Court; the total amount\n            of attorneys’ fees will not exceed 30% of the total\n            settlement fund.  The remainder of the fund will be paid in\n            accordance with the distribution formula described below.\n            THE DISTRIBUTION FORMULA\n                     The parties, while recognizing that each class\n            member has a distinct claim for damages, agree that the\n            expense, uncertainty, and delay of providing each class\n            member with an individual determination of damages outweighs\n            the benefits of distribution by a formula based on the\n            following principles:\n                       1.  Each class member has been rated by class\n            counsel into one of six categories, based primarily on the\n            intrusiveness of the alleged search.  An outline of the\n            considerations used by class counsel is attached to this\n            agreement as Exhibit 1.\n                       2.  Class counsel has used the aggravating and\n            mitigating factors conventionally used by attorneys in\n            assessing cases to subdivide category 6 into \"low,\"\n            \"medium,\" and \"high.\"\n                       3.  Class counsel has notified each class member\n            of her rating and has provided each class member with an\n            opportunity to discuss in person the rating.\n                                        -3-\n\n                       4.  The amount to be paid to each category will\n            depend on the total number of class members in each\n            category, as follows:\n                       a)  Each category will receive a point rating, as\n            set out below:\n                     Category            Points\n                        1                   15\n                        2                   25\n                        3                   45\n                        4                   65\n                        5                   80\n                        6 (low)            100\n                        6 (mid)            110\n                        6 (high)           120\n                       b)  The award for each category will be deter-\n            mined by dividing the total of the settlement fund (less\n            whatever amount is awarded for attorneys’ fees and expenses)\n            by the total number of points.  The parties expect that the\n            final award for each category will be approximately as\n            follows:\n                                       Probable\n                     Category            Award\n                        1                $3000\n                        2                 5000\n                        3                 9000\n                        4                13000\n                        5                16000\n                        6 (low)          20000\n                        7 (mid)          22000\n                        6 (high)         24000\n                                              \n                       c)  A separate category, with a point value of\n            50, has been established for claims asserted for class\n            members who are no longer living.  It is estimated that the\n                                        -4-\n\n            estate of each deceased class member will receive\n            approximately ten thousand dollars.\n                       5.  A class member who disagrees with class\n            counsel’s rating may seek review of her category with the\n            Court.  In order to seek such review, the class member must\n            file with the Clerk of the Court, 219 South Dearborn Street,\n            20th floor, Chicago, Illinois 60604, a \"request for review\"\n            in the form set out in Exhibit \"2\" to this agreement.  Any\n            such \"request for review\" shall be filed with and received\n            by the Clerk of the Court at least one week in advance of\n            the hearing to be held on the fairness of this settlement.\n            The Court shall provide each class member who files such a\n            request for review an opportunity to be heard, either before\n            the Court or before a special master, on her objections.\n            Any class member who, after hearing before the district\n            judge, does not obtain an increase in her total number of\n            points shall have her point rating diminished by five\n            points.  In the event the Court exercises its discretion to\n            appoint a special master, the costs of the master will be\n            paid out of the settlement fund.\n                       6.  After all challenges have been resolved, a\n            final determination of the damages due to each class member\n            will be made in accordance with the computations described\n            in paragraph 4(b) above.\n            DISTRIBUTION AND PAYMENT OF SETTLEMENT\n                     1. In order to receive her share of the settlement\n            each class member must sign and return to class counsel a\n                                        -5-\n\n            satisfaction of judgment, in a form to be agreed to by\n            counsel for the parties.  The satisfaction shall be signed\n            by the personal representative, if any, or if there is no\n            personal representative, shall be signed in the name of\n            deceased class members by the person entitled under Illinois\n            law to execute a small estate affidavit.  Class counsel\n            shall provide the signed satisfaction of judgment to the\n            attorneys for the defendants.\n                     2.  Following delivery to defendants’ counsel of\n            the satisfaction form referred to in the preceding para-\n            graph, class counsel shall prepare checks for the amount due\n            to each class member under the settlement.\n                     3.  Unless otherwise instructed by the class mem-\n            ber, class counsel shall distribute the proceeds of the\n            settlement to each class member by certified mail, return\n            receipt requested, to the address last provided to class\n            counsel.  A class member who desires to pick up her check in\n            person or who wishes that her check be mailed to another\n            address, or that her share of the settlement be wire\n            transferred to an established account, must notify class\n            counsel in writing of this desire.\n            ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES\n                     1.  Class counsel has submitted seven interim fee\n            petitions through this litigation, summarizing the total\n            number of hours performed by each attorney, clerk, and\n            paralegal who has worked on behalf of the plaintiff class.\n                                        -6-\n\n                     2.  The parties are in agreement that a percentage\n            award of thirty percent of the common fund for the fees and\n            expenses which have been and which will be rendered and\n            incurred for the class is neither excessive nor\n            unreasonable.\n            MISSING CLASS MEMBERS\n                     1.  The parties are aware that approximately 10\n            class members have lost contact with class counsel.\n                     2.  Class counsel shall use reasonable efforts to\n            locate the above described class members and may incur\n            reasonable investigative expenses in attempting to locate\n            these class members.\n                     3.  Compensation for the services rendered and\n            reimbursement for the expenses incurred in attempting to\n            locate the above described class members shall be in an\n            amount set by the Court, to be paid out of the missing class\n            members’ funds.\n                     4.  When an above described (\"missing\") class\n            member has been located, class counsel shall obtain from the\n            class member and provide to defendants’ counsel a signed\n            satisfication of judgment form.  Following delivery to\n            defendants’ counsel of the satisfaction form, class counsel\n            shall prepare checks for the amount due to each \"missing\"\n            class member under the settlement and distribute such checks\n            in manner set out in paragraph 3 of \"distribution and\n            payment of settlement\" above.\n                                        -7-\n\n                     5.
