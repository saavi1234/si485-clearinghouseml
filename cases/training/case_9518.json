    "summary": "<p>On May 8, 2003, an individual mistakenly arrested on an erroneous warrant filed a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated by the Sheriff of Will County in that he had been unlawfully detained at the Will County Jail after being ordered released by a judge.  On August 8, 2003, an amended complaint was filed, adding a second named plaintiff and adding Will County, Illinois as a defendant.  The amended complaint also added allegations challenging the Jail's shackling and strip search policies and seeking class certification.  Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that the Sheriff's \"strip search/ shackling\" policy deprived them of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and sought certification of two subclasses: (1) all persons who were handcuffed, shackled, and strip searched at the Will County Jail after being ordered to be immediately released by a judge; and (2) all individuals who were held at the Will County Jail on a recalled or already executed warrant issued after they complained that they were being wrongfully held in custody.  Plaintiffs sought class certification, declaratory judgment, compensatory damages, and costs.  A second amended complaint adding a third named plaintiff was filed on February 12, 2004.</p><p>On May 12, 2004, the District Court (Judge Robert W. Gettleman) certified the case as a class action, establishing two subclasses: (1) all individuals who, between May 8, 2001 and the date of the judgment, were arrested for failure to appear in a misdemeanor or traffic case and, who, upon arrival at the Will County Jail, were strip searched without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he or she was concealing contraband or weapons (the \"post-arrest strip search\" subclass); and (2) all traffic or misdemeanor arrestees who, between May 8, 2001 and the date of the judgment, became entitled to release from the Will County Jail, and who, while being processed out of the Sheriff's custody, were strip searched without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that he or she was concealing contraband or weapons (the \"post-release strip search\" subclass).  The court refused to certify a third subclass consisting of those arrested on \"bad warrants\" because it found that the numerosity requirement had not been met.  Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 2004 WL 1125922, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8717 (N.D.Ill. May 12, 2004). </p><p>Plaintiffs subsequently moved for summary judgment.  On December 16, 2005, the District Court (Judge Gettleman) granted the Plaintiffs' motion, holding that both (1) the blanket policy of strip searching persons arrested for failure to appear in misdemeanor or traffic cases, and (2) the blanket policy of strip searching persons who were returned to jail for processing after being ordered released on traffic or misdemeanor charges violated Fourth Amendment.  Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 405 F.Supp.2d 933 (N.D.Ill. Dec 16, 2005).  On April 14, 2006, the Court, at the request of Defendants, amended its December 16 order to make it immediately appealable.  Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 2006 WL 1005141, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27341 (N.D.Ill. Apr 14, 2006).  </p><p>While the case was on interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the parties settled the lawsuit.  Under the Settlement Agreement, Will County agreed to pay $2.15 million into a common fund to settle all claims for damages, expenses, and attorneys' fees.  Attorneys' fees and expenses were to be paid from the fund and were not to exceed 40% of the total payout.  Each of the three named plaintiffs was to receive $25,000 as an incentive payment.  The remainder of the fund would be used to pay class claims.  It was anticipated that each class member would receive about $700.</p><p>On September 20, 2006, the District Court (Judge Virginia M. Kendall) preliminarily approved the settlement.  After holding a November 17, 2006 fairness hearing, the Court issued a November 27, 2006 order finally approving the settlement.  Subsequent proceedings established the procedure for the final distribution of settlement funds.  No further proceedings are apparent from the docket.</p><p></p>",

DOCiC/:.S \nโข  โข OI:3TftICT COURT \nPlaintiffs, by counsel, alleges as follows: \n1.  This is a civil action arising under 42 U.S.C.  ยง1983.  The jurisdiction of \nthis Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง1343. \n2.  Plaintiff Javar Calvin is a resident of the Northern District of Illinois. \n3.  Plaintiff William Virble Moore is  a resident of the Northern District of \nIllinois. \n4.  Defendant Sheriff of Will County is sued in his official capacity. \n5.  Defendant Will County, Illinois is an Illinois municipal corporation joined \nin this  action pursuant to Carver v.  Sheriff of LaSalle  County,  324 F.3d \n947, 948 (7th Cir. 2003). \nJavar Calvin \n6.  In  October  of  2002,  plaintiff  Calvin  was  enlarged  on  bond  in  a \nmisdemeanor case pending in the state court in Joliet, Illinois. \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 5     Filed 08/08/2003     Page 2 of 6(cid:10)\n- 2 -\n7.  On October 19, 2002, a police officer of the City of Bolingbrook, Illinois \narrested plaintiff Calvin because records maintained by defendant mistak \nenly indicated that a warrant had been issued for plaintiffs arrest. \n8.  Plaintiff Calvin was brought to the Will County Jail on October 20, 2002 \nat about 4:00 a.m.  While at  the jail, plaintiff repeatedly insisted that he \nhad been arrested by mistake and that he was not sought in any outstand \ning warrant.  Calvin's protestations were ignored by jail personnel. \n9.  Calvin was scheduled to appear before a judge in the morning of Monday, \nOctober 21, 2002.  Calvin determined that he was not among the prisoners \nwho  were being taken to  court and complained to jail officials. The jail \nofficials  responded  to  Calvin's complaint by  placing him in disciplinary \nsegregation. \n10.  Shortly after 9:00 a.m.  on October 21,  2002,  a judge reviewed Calvin's \nbail  status,  concluded  that  Calvin  was  being  held  in error,  and ordered \nplaintiffs release.  Jail personnel ignored this order until 1:00 p.m., when \nthey took Calvin from disciplinary segregation and brought him before the \njudge.  The judge reaffirmed his order that plaintiff should be immediately \nreleased. \n11.  After the judge ordered that plaintiff should be immediately released, jail \npersonnel maintained Calvin in handcuffs and shackles and returned him \nto the jail. \n12.  At the jail, Calvin was strip searched and returned to disciplinary segrega \ntion,  where  he  remained  until  he  was  released  at  about  7:30 p.m.  that \nnight. \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 5     Filed 08/08/2003     Page 3 of 6(cid:10)\n- 3 -\nWilliam Moore \n13.  On May  18, 2003, a police officer of the City of Chicago Ridge, Illinois \narrested plaintiff Moore because records maintained by defendant mistak \nenly indicated that a warrant had been issued for plaintiffs arrest. \n14.  Moore  was  brought to, the Will  County Jail  on May  18,  2003  at  about \n9:00 a.m. \n15.  While at the jail, Moore repeatedly insisted that he had been arrested by \nmistake and that he was not sought in any outstanding warrant. \n16.  Moore's protestations  were ignored by jail personnel who,  in accordance \nwith the policies of defendant, held plaintiff overnight at the jail. \n17.  In  accordance  with  the  policies  of defendant,  Moore  was  handcuffed, \nshackled and taken before a judge at about  1:30 p.m. on May  19, 2003. \nThe judge ordered that plaintiff was to be released immediately. \n18.  After the judge ordered that plaintiff be released  immediately,  in accor \ndance with the policies of defendant, plaintiff was held in handcuffs and \nshackles and taken back to the jail where he was strip searched and placed \nin a cell. \n19.  Plaintiff was released from  the  cell after about ten minutes  of additional \nincarceration. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n20.  The  above  described  shacklings  and  strip  searches  were  undertaken  in \naccordance with a policy of defendant Sheriff of Will County. \n21.  This  \"strip  search/shackling\"  policy  is  uniformly  applied  to  all  persons \nafter they have appeared in court, irrespective of any court order that they \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 5     Filed 08/08/2003     Page 4 of 6(cid:10)\n- 4 -\nbe immediately released. \n22.  Plaintiffs contend that as  a result of this  \"strip search/shackling\"  policy, \nthey,  and others  whose immediate release has  been  ordered by  a judge, \nwere deprived of rights secured by Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment. \n23.  The refusal of jail personnel  to  take  any  action to  investigate plaintiffs \nprotestations  that  they  were  being  held  in  error  was  the  result  of  the \nfailure of defendant Will County to have adopted a policy to require the \nspeedy investigation of such claims. \n24.  The  absence  of such  a  policy  has  resulted  in  numerous  persons  being \nwrongfully detained at the Will County jail. \n25.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  individually  and  for  the  following  two  sub \nclasses: \ni.  All persons who,  at any time on and after two years preceding the \nfiling of this lawsuit to the date of entry of judgment, were held in \nhandcuffs  and  shackles  at the Will County Jail and  strip  searched \nafter  a  judge  ordered  their  immediate  release  from  custody  and \nbefore being released. \nii.  All persons who, in the two year period preceding the filing of this \nlawsuit  to  the  date  of entry  of judgment,  were  held  at  the  Will \nCounty Jail on a recalled or  already executed warrant issued after \nhaving complained that they were being wrongfully held in custody. \n26.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\nEASTERN DIVISION\nJAVAR CALVIN, WILLIAM VIRBLE )\nMOORE AND CHARLES DAVIS,  )\nPlaintiffs, )\n-vs- ) No. 03 CV 3086\n)\nSHERIFF OF WILL COUNTY AND ) (Judge Kendall)\nWILL COUNTY, ILLINOIS )\nDefendants. )\nCLASS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nThis settlement agreement is entered into by all parties to this action through their \nrespective undersigned counsel to resolve all matters at issue in this action.\nRECITALS\n1. Nature of litigation.  Plaintiffs filed the above captioned action, for \nthemselves and all others similarly situated, in the United States District Court for \nthe Northern District of Illinois alleging violations of their Fourth Amendment \nrights under the U.S. Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, resulting from \nstrip searches conducted of them at the Will County Adult Detention Facility \n(โWCADFโ).\n2. Class Certification.  Pursuant to the Court's order of May 12, 2004, \nthis case is proceeding as a class action for two subclasses defined as follows:\nAny person who, from May 8, 2001, to the date of entry of \njudgment has been, is, or will be arrested on a warrant issued for \nfailure to appear in a misdemeanor or traffic case and, following \narrival at the Will County Adult Detention Facility, is or was strip \nsearched without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion \n\nor probable cause that he or she was concealing contraband or \nweapons. (โSubclass Iโ)\nand\nAny person who, from May 8, 2001, to the date of entry of \njudgment has been, is, or will be in the custody of the Sheriff of \nWill County on a traffic or misdemeanor charge (or on a warrant \nissued for failure to appear on a traffic or misdemeanor charge), \ntaken to court from the Will County Adult Detention Facility, \nordered released by the court, or otherwise became entitled to \nimmediate   release,   was   returned  to   the   Will   County   Adult \nDetention Facility to be processed out of the custody of the Sheriff \nof Will County, and was strip searched without any individualized \nfinding of reasonable suspicion that he or she was concealing \ncontraband or weapons. (โSubclass IIโ).\n3. Important Rulings.   On December 16, 2005, the Court granted \nplaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and entered a finding of liability against \ndefendant Sheriff of Cook County and in favor of Subclass One and Subclass \nTwo.  Thereafter, on April 14, 2006, the Court granted defendants' motion to \ncertify the order granting summary judgment for an interlocutory appeal pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. ยง1292(b). The Court of Appeals granted permission to appeal on May \n18, 2006.\n4. Settlement Conference. In accordance with Seventh Circuit Rule \n33, the parties participated in a Settlement Conference with Joel N. Shapiro, \nSenior Conference Attorney of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh \nCircuit.  With the invaluable assistance of Mr. Shapiro, the parties have agreed to a \nresolution of their disputes in this action.  The class members desire to settle their \nclaims against Defendant, having taken into account through their counsel the \nrisks, delay and difficulties involved in establishing a right to recovery in excess of \n2\n\nthat offered by this settlement and the likelihood that the litigation will be further \nprotracted and expensive.   Class Counsel has investigated the facts and the \napplicable law.  Based on the foregoing, and upon an analysis of the benefits that \nthis Settlement Agreement affords the class, Class Counsel considers it to be in the \nbest interest of the class to enter into this Settlement Agreement.\n5. No Admission of Liability.  Defendants deny liability to Plaintiffs \nand the class for the claims alleged, but consider it desirable that the action and the \nclaims alleged therein be settled upon the terms and conditions set forth in this \nAgreement, in order to avoid further expense and burdensome, protracted \nlitigation, and to put to rest all claims, known or unknown, that have been or might \nbe asserted by Plaintiffs or the class members against Defendant. \nIn consideration of the foregoing,  Plaintiffs, Class Counsel and Defendants \nstipulate and agree that the claims of the named Plaintiffs and the class against \nDefendants should be and are hereby compromised and settled, subject to the \napproval of the court, upon the following terms and conditions.\nTERMS\n6. Relief to the Class.   To resolve all claims at issue in this case, \nincluding but not limited to claims for compensatory damages and claims for \nattorneys' fees and expenses, the parties have agreed that, as part of the \nconsideration   for   this   Agreement,   including   the   releases   contained  herein, \nDefendants agree to pay a total amount of $2,150,000 (Two Million One Hundred \n3\n\nand Fifty Thousand Dollars) (โSettlement Fundโ) in full settlement of all claims by \nall members of both subclasses. With respect to all claims asserted on behalf of \neach subclass, plaintiffs have agreed to waive their right to individual damage \ntrials.  The defendants have agreed to waive their right to appeal from the district \ncourt's finding of liability.  \n7. Incentive Payments.   Each of the named plaintiffs will receive, \nsubject to the approval of the court, an incentive award of $25,000 to be paid from \nthe Settlement Fund.    Defendants agree not to oppose Plaintiffsโ petition for such \nincentive awards. Such awards shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any other \nawards to which the named plaintiffs may be entitled under this settlement. \n8. Administration, Attorneysโ Fees and Expenses.  The cost of \nadministration of the settlement will be paid from the Settlement Fund, as will \nattorneysโ fees and expenses.  These costs include, but are not limited to, notice to \nthe class, attempting to locate class members who are not reached by first class \nmail to their last known address, processing of claim forms and 1099 forms, \nissuance of settlement checks, and mailing (by certified mail, return reply \nrequested) of settlement shares to class members.   The settlement will be \nadministered by  Analytics, Incorporated, who has provided these services in \nsimilar cases and who has previously been engaged by class counsel in this case \nfor the mailing of class notice. The total amount of attorneys' fees and reimbursed \nexpenses will not exceed 40% of the total Settlement Fund, in an amount to be set \nby the Court.  Defendants have agreed not to challenge any such request for fees \n4\n\nand reimbursement of expenses that may be made by class counsel.  Class counsel \nintends to seek a total award of fees and reimbursement of expenses in an amount \nnot to exceed forty percent of the total settlement in accord with the standard in the \ncommunity of contingent fees ranging between one-third and 40% of the total \nrecovery, with the higher percentage applying in risky cases and in those with a \nlikelihood of a small recovery. The parties are in agreement that, subject to the \napproval of the Court, one-third of the total settlement plus reimbursement for the \nactual cost of class notice and the actual cost of notice of this proposed settlement \nshall be paid to class counsel as fees and reimbursable expenses and that any \nbalance remaining in the โReserve Fundโ (as described below) on December 1, \n2007 shall be paid to class counsel as additional fees.\n9. Payments to Class Members.  The parties, while recognizing that \neach class member has a distinct claim for damages, agree that the expense, \nuncertainty, and delay of providing each class member with an individual \ndetermination of damages outweighs the benefits of distribution on an pro rata \nbasis.  After the deduction of attorneyโs fees and reimbursable expenses, the costs \nof administration of this settlement, and the incentive awards to the named \nPlaintiffs,  the remainder of the Settlement Fund (hereinafter the โNet Settlementโ) \nwill be distributed to each class member who has not excluded him or herself, and \nwho timely returns a claim form.  Each class member who submits a timely claim \nform will receive a payment from the balance of the Settlement Fund based upon \nthe procedures described below.  The amount that each unnamed member of the \n5\n\nplaintiff class will receive cannot be computed until there has been a final \ndetermination of the number of class members who timely return a claim form; \nbased on experience in other, similar cases, counsel for the parties estimate that \neach class member will receive an award greater than four hundred dollars ($400) \nand less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n10. Notice and Claims Procedures.  \na. Within seven days after the Court has given its preliminary approval \nto this proposed settlement, notice of the proposed settlement, information about \nthe date and time of the fairness hearing, and notice of a right to opt-out (for those \nmembers that have not previously received such opportunity) will be sent by first \nclass mail to the last ascertainable address of each member of subclass one and \nsubclass two. As used herein, โascertainableโ means the last known address as \nenhanced by the United States Postal Service change of address database.  For any \nnotice which is returned as undeliverable, reasonable efforts will be made to locate \nthe class member using industry standard address correction procedures.  The cost \nof this notice will be paid in the first instance by Plaintiffs and, assuming that this \nsettlement obtains final approval from the Court, will be reimbursed from the total \namount of the settlement.\nb. The notice of the proposed settlement will be accompanied by a \n1099 form and a claim form that includes the release described below. Class \nmembers will be required   to return the executed forms to the class action \n6\n\nadministrator on or before December 1, 2006. Late claimants may receive payment \nunder the provisions of subparagraph (e) below. \nc. Within 7 days of the โFinal Approval Date,โ as defined below, the \ntotal amount of the settlement shall be transferred by defendants to an IOLTA \nclient trust fund account maintained within the State of Illinois by class counsel. \nAs used herein, โFinal Approval Dateโ means the 31st day following entry of the \norder approving the settlement or, if there is an appeal, when the Court's order \napproving the settlement reaches a final adjudication.\nd. Efforts to locate class members will continue through the date of the \nfairness hearing. \ne. On or before December 18, 2006, payments will be made to each \nclass member who has timely returned the 1099 form and claim form. A claim \nform shall be deemed timely it is received by the class action administrator on or \nbefore December 1, 2006. The amount of these payments will be computed by \ndividing the โNet Settlementโ less a โReserve Fundโ by the number of timely \nclaimants. One fifteenth (1/15) of the โNet Settlementโ shall be set aside as the \nโReserve Fundโ and will be maintained by class counsel in an IOLTA account \nwithin the State of Illinois.\nf. The โReserve Fundโ will be used to pay claims of class members \nwho submit claim forms and 1099 form to the class action administrator on or \nbefore the earlier of December 1, 2007 or the date that the reserve fund is \n7\n\nexhausted. Each such claimant will be paid in the same collar amount as the claims \npaid pursuant to subparagraph (e) above. In the event that the reserve fund is \ninsufficient to pay the full amount to each claimant whose claim form and 1099 \nform is received on the day on which the fund is exhausted, each such claimant \nwill receive an aliquot share of the balancing remaining in the fund.\ng. No part of the โReserve Fundโ will be returned to defendants.\nh. Any balance remaining in the โReserve Fundโ on December 1, 2007 \nshall be paid to class counsel as additional fees.\n12. Release.   Plaintiffs and the members of the class will grant \nDefendants the following release:\nPlaintiffs and each class member do hereby release and forever discharge the \nDefendants, and their present or former parents, officers, directors, partners, \nmembers, principals, insurers, insureds, representatives, employees, agents, \nservants, predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, and \nassigns (\"Released Parties\") of and from all causes of action, suits, claims and \ndemands, whatsoever, for anything that occurred from the beginning of time up \nthrough and including the date the Court gives final approval to this settlement \nagreement, in law or in equity, known or unknown at this time, arising out of all \nof the factual allegations made in the above-captioned action, under any legal \ntheory.   This release is conditioned on the final approval of the Settlement \nAgreement by the Court and Defendant meeting its obligations therein. \n13. Enforcement and Reservation of Jurisdiction.  The parties agree \nthat the Court will reserve jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this agreement \n8\n\nand that the Court may, for good cause, adjust and reset the dates set out in \nparagraph 10 above. \nAgreed to, this 15th day of September, 2006.\n/s/ Kenneth N.

      "text": "--  --\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\nEASTERN DIVISION\nJAVAR CALVIN, et al.,  )\n)\nPlaintiff, )\n)  No. 03 CV 3086\n-vs-  )\n) (Judge Kendall)\nSHERIFF OF WILL COUNTY, et al.,  )\n)\nDefendant. )\nPLAINTIFFโS MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT\nOF APPROVAL OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT\nMore  than  5000  classmembers  have  received  notice  of  the  proposed\nsettlement of this case.1 Not a single class member has objected to any portion\nof the settlement.  For the reasons set out below, the Court should approve the\nproposed settlement.2\nI.  History of the Litigation\nThis action began on May 8, 2003, with the ๏ฌling of a single count com-\nplaint by original plaintiff Javar Calvin. Plaintiff ๏ฌled an amended complaint on\nAugust 12, 2003, adding William Moore as a plaintiff and adding allegations to\nchallenge  an  alleged \"strip  search/shackling\" policy.  A  third  named  plaintiff,\nCharles  Davis,  was  added  in  the  second  amended  complaint  on  February  12,\n__ ____________\n1. Notice was mailed to 6570 persons; 1552 notices were returned as non-deliverable\nby the United States Post Of๏ฌce.\n2. As  explained  below  at  7-8,  class  counsel,  with  the  agreement  of  defendants,\nrequests that the Court modify the payout schedule.\n\n- 2 -\n2004.  This pleading refocused plaintiffsโ policy allegations, and was ๏ฌled con-\ntemporaneously with a motion for class certi๏ฌcation.\nOn  May  12,  2004,  the  district  court  granted  the  motion  for  class\ncerti๏ฌcation  for  two  of  the  three  subclasses  proposed  by  plaintiffs.3 Plaintiffs\nprovided notice of the pendency of the case to the class and, after completing\ndiscovery  on  class  liability  issues,  moved  for  summary  judgment.  Defendants\nopposed this motion, but the district court granted summary judgment on liabil-\nity  to  the  plaintiff  class  on  December  16,  2005. Calvin  v.  Sheriff, 405\nF.Supp.2d 933 (N.D.Ill. 2005).\nOn  April  14,  2006,  the  court  granted  defendantโs  motion  to  certify  the\norder granting summary judgment for an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C.\nยง1292(b).  The Seventh Circuit granted the petition for permission to appeal on\nMay 18, 2006.\nAfter the appeal was docketed in the Court of Appeals, the parties partici-\npated in a settlement conference with Joel N. Shapiro, Senior Conference Attor-\nney  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Seventh  Circuit.  With  the\ninvaluable assistance of Mr. Shapiro, which extended over several months, the\nparties agreed to the proposed settlement which is now before the Court for ๏ฌnal\napproval.\n__ _____________\n3. The court refused to certify on numerosity grounds the third subclass proposed by\nplaintiffs.  A  claim  similar  to  that  which  plaintiffs  had  sought  to  assert  for  this\nsubclass was rejected by the Seventh Circuit in Hernandez v. Sheahan, 455 F.3d\n772 (7th Cir. 2006).\n\n- 3 -\nII.  The Proposed Settlement\nThe proposed settlement brings this litigation to an end. Defendants, who\nabandoned the challenged policies during the pendency of this case, will pay a\ntotal amount of $2,150,000.  This Fund will cover administration of the settle-\nment, i.e., notice to the class, attempting to locate class members who are not\nreached  by  ๏ฌrst  class  mail  to  their  last  known  address,  processing  of  claim\nforms and 1099 forms, issuance of settlement checks, and mailing (by certi๏ฌed\nmail, return reply requested) of settlement shares to class members.  Class coun-\nsel  has,  to  date,  advanced  $7,192.73  towards  notice;  counsel  expects  that  an\nadditional $35,000 will be required to process the claims.\nAttorneysโ  fees  and  expenses,  and  incentive  awards  to  the  three  named\nplaintiffs will also come from the Fund.  The balance of the Fund will be distri-\nbuted on an aliquot basis to the class.\nThe  settlement  agreement  provides  that,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the\ncourt, each of the three named plaintiff will receive an incentive award in the\namount of $25,000.4 This amount re๏ฌects the service that each named plaintiff\nprovided  to  the  class  and  is  of  comparable  magnitude  to  incentive  awards  in\nother jail strip search cases.5\n__ _____________\n4. The incentive award is to paid to each named plaintiff without any deduction for\nattorneysโ fees or costs.\n5. The class representative received a $25,000 incentive award in Maneely v. City of\nNewburg, S.D.N.Y.,  No.  01-cv-2600;  each  of  the  two  class  representatives  in\nBlihove v. St. Croix County, W.D.Wis. No. 02-cv-450 received a $35,000 incentive\naward,  and  $300,000  was  distributed  to  three  class  representatives  in Haney  v.\nMiami Dade County, S.D. Fl., No. 04-cv-20516.\n\n- 4 -\nThe settlement agreement also provides that attorneys fees and reimbursed\nexpenses will not exceed 40% of the Fund.6 Assuming that the Court approves\nthe  requested  fee,  as  well  as  the  proposed  incentive  awards,  there  will  be\n$1,172,800.00 available for distribution to the class after payment of administra-\ntion costs.\nThe class notice (Exhibit 1, attached), advised members of the class that\neach  would  receive  at  least  four  hundred  dollars,  with  a  probable  payout  of\nseven hundred dollars.  765 claims forms have been returned as of November\n15,  2006.  Assuming  that  this  number  does  not  increase  beyond  800  by  the\nDecember 1st deadline, each class member would receive $1,466.7\nIII.  Standards for Approving the Settlement of a Class Action\nThe standards for approving the settlement of a class action were recently\nrestated by the Seventh Circuit in Synfuel Technologies, Inc. v. DHL Express\n(USA), Inc. 463 F.3d 646, 653 (7th Cir. 2006):\nIn order  to  evaluate  the  fairness  of  a  settlement,  a  district  court\nmust  consider  the  strength  of  plaintiffsโ  case  compared  to  the\namount of defendantsโ settlement offer, an assessment of the likely\ncomplexity, length and expense of the litigation, an evaluation of\nthe amount of opposition to settlement among affected parties, the\nopinion of competent counsel, and the stage of the proceedings and\n__ ____________\n6. This percentage is set out in the notice of settlement that was mailed to each class\nmembers: \"Attorneysโ fees and expenses will be paid from this Settlement Fund in\nan amount to be set by the Court and not to exceed 40% of the Fund.\"\n7. As  explained  below  at  7-8,  class  counsel,  with  the  agreement  of  defendants,\nsuggests that each class member receive an initial payment of $1,000, and a second\npayment of any balance remaining on December 1, 2007.\n\n- 5 -\nthe amount of discovery completed at the time of settlement. [cita-\ntion omitted] The most important factor relevant to the fairness of\na  class  action  settlement  is  the  ๏ฌrst  one  listed:  the  strength  of\nplaintiffโs case on the merits balanced against the amount offered\nin the settlement. [citation omitted]\nBefore the Seventh Circuit granted  the  petition  to  appeal,  class  counsel\nbelieved that the order granting summary judgment did not involve any \"conte-\nstable\" legal  issue,  an  essential  element  to  the  grant  of  permission  to  appeal\nunder 28 U.S.C. ยง1292(b). Ahrenholz v. Board of Trustees of the University of\nIllinois, 219  F.3d  674,  675  (7th  Cir.  2000).  Class counsel vigorously argued\nthis  point  in  opposing  the petition for permission to appeal, pointing out that\neach circuit which has considered the constitutionality of policies like those at\nissue in this case had found the policies to be unlawful. The Seventh Circuit,\nhowever, did not accept this argument when it granted permission to appeal.\nOur court of appeals has not been reluctant to plow new ground in civil\nrights cases.  For example, in Newsome v. McCabe, 256 F.3d 747, 751 (7th Cir.\n2001), opinion  on  denial  of  rehearing, 260  F.3d  824  (7th  Cir.  2001),  the\nSeventh Circuit overruled its long standing precedent and departed from deci-\nsions in eight circuits to hold that 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 does not include a cause of\naction analogous to a common law action of malicious prosecution.  Similarly,\nin Wallace v. Kato, 440 F.3d 421 (7th Cir. 2006), cert. granted, June 19, 2006,\nNo. 05-1240, the Seventh Circuit overruled two of its recent decisions to estab-\nlish a categorical rule of accrual for Section 1983 cases arising from an unlawful\narrest.  As with its holding in Newsome, the categorical rule that our Court of\nAppeals adopted in Wallace is different from the rule applied in other circuits.\nIn light of the uncertainty that was added to the case by the grant of the\npetition for permission to appeal, the settlement provides a reasonable monetary\n\n- 6 -\nrecovery to the unnamed members of the plaintiff class.  If each class member\nin this case receive $1,000, this would be the same as in two other jail strip\nsearch cases, Doan  v.  Watson, S.D.Ind.,  No.  99-4-C-B/S, Bull  v.  Sacramento\nCounty, California  Superior  Court,  CA  No.  01AS01545,  and Kahler  v.\nRenssalear County Jail, N.D.N.Y., No. 3-cv-1324.\nIn addition to considering the strength of plaintiffโs case on the merits and\nthe monetary payment to each class member, \"district judges presiding over pro-\nposed class settlements are expected to give careful scrutiny to the terms of pro-\nposed  settlements  in  order  to  make  sure  that  class  counsel  are  behaving  as\nhonest ๏ฌduciaries for the class as a whole because class actions are rife with\npotential con๏ฌicts of interest between class counsel and class members.\" (cita-\ntions  omitted) Mirfasihi  v.  Fleet  Mortg.  Corp. 450  F.3d  745,  748  (7th  Cir.\n2006).  The proposed settlement in this case was negotiated with the assistance\nof  the  Seventh  Circuitโs  Senior  Settlement  Attorney  Joel  Shapiro,  and  was\nthereby pre-screened to avoid any such con๏ฌicts.\nThe settlement in this case is a reasonable resolution of this class action\nand should be approved by the Court.\n\n- 7 -\nIV.  The Proposed Modi๏ฌcation of the Pay-Out Schedule\nAs drafted by the parties, the settlement agreement calls for a single pay-\nout to class members who returned their claim form by December 1, 2006. Class\nmembers  who  submit  claim  forms  after  the  December  1st  date  but  before\nDecember  1,2007  would  be  paid  from  a \"reserve  fund\" until  that  fund  is\nexhausted.8\n765 claims forms have been returned as of November 15, 2006.  Assum-\ning that this number does not increase beyond 800 by the December 1, 2006,\neach class member would receive $1,466, and the \"reserve fund\" would allow\npayments to about another 100 class members.\nThe return rate (15%, 765 claim forms from 5018 presumably delivered\nnotices), is much lower than the 20% to 30% range that class counsel had antici-\npated.  Class  counsel  expects  that  the  response  rate  will  increase  as  soon  as\nchecks are mailed out.\nTo insure that the settlement is distributed to as many class members as\npossible, class counsel therefore suggests that the initial payout on December 18,\n2006 be limited to $1,000.  The balance of the settlement fund, after payment of\nincentive payments, attorneysโ fees and costs, and the costs of administration of\nthe settlement, would be held as the \"reserve fund.\" Class members who come\nforward before December 1, 2007 would receive the same $1,000 payment, until\n__ _____________\n8. The \"reserve fund\" was set at 1/15 of the total settlement; any balance remaining in\nthe \"reserve fund\" would be paid to class counsel as additional fees.\n\n- 8 -\nthe reserve fund is exhausted. If money remain in the reserve fund on December\n1, 2007, it will be distributed to class counsel (for additional fees not to exceed\n40% of the total settlement), with any balance (after payment of the costs of a\nsecond distribution), being distributed on an aliquot basis to each class member.\nThis revision to the payout schedule would be consistent with the class notice,\nwhich advises each class member that the likely payout \"may be approximately\nseven hundred dollars.\" (A copy of the class notice is attached as Exhibit 1.)\nV.  Attorneys Fees\n\"[A] lawyer who recovers a common fund for the bene๏ฌt of persons other\nthan himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorneyโs fee from the fund\nas a whole.\" Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U.S. 472, 478 (1980).  This is\nbecause \"persons who obtain the bene๏ฌt of a lawsuit without contributing to its\ncosts are unjustly enriched at the successful litigantโs expense.\" Id., citing Mills\nv. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 392 (1970).\nThe rule in this circuit is that \"when deciding on appropriate fee levels in\ncommon-fund cases, courts must do their best to award counsel the market price\nfor  legal  services,  in  light  of  the  risk  of  nonpayment  and  the  normal  rate  of\ncompensation in the market at the time.\" In re Synthroid Marketing Litigation,\n264 F.3d 712, 718 (7th Cir. 2001), opinion following remand, 325 F.3d 974 (7th\nCir. 2003). \"The object in awarding a reasonable attorneyโs fee . . .  is to simu-\nlate the market . . .  The class counsel are entitled to the fee they would have\nreceived had they handled a similar suit on a contingent fee basis, with a similar\noutcome, for a paying client. In re Continental Securities Litigation, 962 F.2d\n566, 572 (7th Cir. 1992).\nCivil rights cases are typically litigated on a contingent basis, where the\nlawyer agrees to accept a percentage of the recovery as his (or her) fee, subject\n\n- 9 -\nto a credit for any statutory fees are awarded.  This percentage ranges from the\ncustomary one-third, Freeman v. Mayer, 95 F.3d 569, 570 (7th Cir. 1996) to\n40%. Kirchoff v. Flynn, 786 F.2d 320, 322 (7th Cir. 1986).  Attorneys use the\nhigher percentage when the claim is small and the case is likely to be resolved\nby settlement, without any award of statutory fees.\nIn  accord  with  these  principles,  class  counsel  seeks  an  award  (to  cover\nfees and litigation expenses) of forty percent of the settlement fund, with one-\nthird to be paid contemporaneously with distribution to the class, and the bal-\nance to be held in the \"reserve fund,\" and paid on December 1, 2007, if the fund\nhas not been exhausted by late claimants.9\nVI.  Conclusion\nFor the reasons above stated, plaintiffs request that the Court approve the\nproposed  settlement,  authorize  incentive  payments  of  $25,000  to  each  of  the\nnamed plaintiffs, and approve counselโs request for an award of fees of forty\npercent of the settlement fund, with fees in the amount of one-third of the settle-\nment fund to be paid contemporaneously with distribution to the class, and the\nbalance to be held in the \"reserve fund,\" and paid to counsel on December 1,\n2007 if the \"reserve fund\" has not been exhausted by late claimants.\nPlaintiffs also request that the Court modify the payout schedule, so that\nthe  initial  payout  on  December  18,  2006  is  limited  to  $1,000  to  each  class\n__ ____________\n9. Counsel also seeks reimbursement for the $7,192.73 that he has advanced for class\nnotice.\n\n- 10 -\nmembers who has ๏ฌled a claim, with the remainder being added to the \"reserve\nfund\" and distributed to class members who submit claim forms after December\n1,  2006  and  before  December  1,  2007,  with  any  balance  remaining  in  the\n\"reserve fund,\" in excess of the additional attorney fees referred to above, to be\ndistributed on a aliquot basis for each class member who has ๏ฌled a claim form.\nFinally,  plaintiffs  request  that  the  Court  authorize  the  reimbursement  to\nclass counsel of the $7,192.73 that he has advanced for class notice and author-\nize the payment from the settlement fund to Analytics, Incorporated of its ordi-\nnary and necessary expenses in administering the settlement.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Kenneth N.

This is a civil action arising under 42 U.S.C.  ยง1983.  The jurisdiction of \nthis Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง1343. \n2.  Plaintiff Javar Calvin is a resident of the Northern District of Illinois. \n3.  Plaintiff William Virble  Moore  is  a resident of the  Northern  District of \nIllinois. \n4.  Plaintiff Charles Davis is a resident of the Northern District of Illinois. \n5.  Defendant Sheriff of Will County is sued in his official capacity. \n6.  Defendant Will County, Illinois is an Illinois municipal corporation joined \nin this  action pursuant to  Carver v.  Sheriff of LaSalle County,  324 F.3d \n947, 948 (7th Cir. 2003). \nJavar Calvin \n7.  In  October  of  2002,  plaintiff  Calvin  was  enlarged  on  bond  in  a \nmisdemeanor case pending in the state court in Joliet, Illinois. \n\\\\ \n\n- 2 -\n8.  On October 19,2002, a police officer of the City of Bolingbrook, Illinois \narrested plaintiff Calvin because records maintained by defendant mistak \nenly indicated that a warrant had been issued for plaintiff s arrest. \n9.  Plaintiff Calvin was brought to the Will County Jail on October 20, 2002 \nat about 4:00 a.m. \n10.  Upon his arrival at the jail, plaintiff was strip searched in accordance with \na policy of the Sheriff of Will County \n11.  While at the jail, plaintiff repeatedly insisted that he had been arrested by \nmistake and that he was not sought in any outstanding warrant.  Calvin's \nprotestations were ignored by jail personnel. \n12.  Calvin was scheduled to appear before a judge in the morning of Monday, \nOctober 21, 2002.  Calvin determined that he was not among the prisoners \nwho  were  being  taken  to  court and complained to jail officials.  The jail \nofficials  responded  to  Calvin's  complaint by  placing  him in  disciplinary \nsegregation. \n13.  Shortly  after 9:00 a.m.  on  October 21,  2002,  a judge reviewed Calvin's \ncustody status, concluded that Calvin was being held in error, and ordered \nhis  release.  Jail personnel  ignored  this  order until  1:00 p.m.,  when they \ntook  Calvin  from  disciplinary  segregation  and  brought  him  before  the \njudge. \nof \n14.  Before being brought before the judge, and in accordance with a policy \nthe Sheriff of Cook County, Calvin was strip searched. \n15.  The  judge  reaffirmed  his  order  that  plaintiff  should  be  immediately \nreleased. \n\nโข \n- 3 -\n16.  After  the judge ordered that Calvin should be immediately released, jail \npersonnel maintained Calvin in handcuffs  and shackles and returned him \nto the jail. \n17.  At the jail, Calvin was strip searched and returned to disciplinary segrega \ntion,  where  he  remained  until  he  was  released  at  about 7:30  p.m.  that \nnight. \nWilliam Moore \n18.  On May  18, 2003,  a police officer of the City of Chicago Ridge, Illinois \narrested plaintiff Moore because records maintained by defendant mistak \nenly indicated that a warrant had been issued for plaintiff's arrest. \n19.  Moore  was  brought to  the  Will County Jail on May  18,  2003  at about \n9:00 a.m. \n20.  Upon his arrival at the jail, plaintiff was strip searched in accordance with \na policy of the Sheriff of Will County \n21.  While at the jail, Moore repeatedly insisted that he had  been arrested by \nmistake and that he was not sought in any outstanding warrant. \n22.  Moore's protestations were ignored by jail personnel who, in accordance \nwith the policies of defendant, held plaintiff overnight at the jail. \n23.  In accordance  with  the  policies  of defendant,  Moore was  strip-searcl;1ed, \nhandcuffed, shackled and taken before a judge at about 1: 30 p.m.  on May \n19,2003.  The judge ordered that plaintiff was to be released immediately. \n\n- 4 -\nCharles Davis \n24.  On  September  21,  2003,  a  police  officer  of the  City  of Joliet,  Illinois \narrested plaintiff Davis because records maintained by defendant mistak \nenly indicated that a warrant had been issued for plaintiff s arrest. \n25.  Davis  was  brought to  the  Will  County Jail  at about 5:00 p.m.  on Sep \ntember 21, 2003. \n26.  Upon his arri val at the jail, plaintiff was strip searched in accordance with \na policy of the Sheriff of Will County \n27.  While at the jail, Davis advised correctional staff that, before his arrest, he \nhad been taking prescribed pain medication, that he had not been provided \nwith any pain medication after his arrest, and that he was in constant pain. \n28.  Correctional staff infonned Davis that it would take a week or two before \nhe could begin to receive his prescribed pain medication. \n29.  In  accordance  with  the  policies  of defendant,  Davis  was  strip-searched, \nhandcuffed, shackled and taken before a judge at about 10:00 a.m. on Sep \ntember 22,  2003.  The judge concluded  that Davis  had  been arrested in \nerror and ordered his immediate release. \n30.  After the judge ordered that Davis be released immediately, in accordance \nwith the policies of defendant, Davis was held in handcuffs and shackles \nand taken back to the jail where he was again strip searched and placed in \na cell. \n31.  Davis  was  released from  the  cell after several hours  of additional incar \nceration. \n\n, \n- 5 -\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n32.  Plaintiffs bring this case on behalf of the following three subclasses, con \nsisting of all persons who from May 8, 2001  to the date of entry of judg \nment have been, is, or will be \n1.  Arrested on an erroneous computer indication that a warrant \nhas been issued for his (or her) arrest for failure to appear in \ncourt in a misdemeanor or traffic case and is held overnight \nat the Will County Jail; \nII.  Arrested on a warrant issued for failure to appear in court in \na  misdemeanor or traffic  case and,  following  arrival  at the \nWill County Jail, is or was strip searched without any indivi \ndualized  finding  of reasonable  suspicion  or probable  cause \nthat he was concealing contraband or weapons. \nIII.  In the custody of the Sheriff of Will County on a  traffic or \nmisdemeanor charge, taken  to  court  from  the  Will  County \nJail,  ordered  released  by  the  Court  or  became  entitled  to \nrelease because  the charge on which he (or she)  was  being \nheld was no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, \nwas  ordered  released on  his  (or  her)  own recognizance, or \nhad posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted \nor was  otherwise entitled to  release,  was  not the  subject of \nany other pending case or cases  which  imposed any  condi \ntion of release other than personal recognizance, was not the \nsubject of any detainer or warrant, was returned in shackles \nto the Will County Jail to be processed out of the custody of \nthe  Sheriff of Will County, and was  strip searched without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that he (or \nshe) was concealing contraband or weapons. \n33.  Plaintiffs Calvin, Moore, and Davis will adequately represent the claims of \nSubclass I and contend that the Sheriffs refusal to have adopted a system \nto check the correctness of \"failure to appear warrants\"  amounts  to deli \nberate indifference and results in unreasonable detention. \n\n; \nโข \n- 6 -\n34.  Plaintiffs Calvin, Moore, and Davis will adequately represent the claims of \nSubclass II and contend that Sheriffs policy of strip searching (both upon \narrival  at  the  jail  and  before  being  taken  to  court)  persons  arrested  on \n\"failure to appear warrants\" that had been issued in traffic or misdemeanor \ncases  without any individualized finding  of reasonable suspicion  that the \narrestee was concealing contraband or weapons results in deprivations of \nFourth Amendment rights; \n35.  Plaintiffs Calvin and Davis,  who  were each entitled to immediate release \nafter  their  respective  court  appearances,  will  adequately  represent  the \nclaims of Subclass III and contend that the  Sheriffs policy of shackling \nand  then  strip  searching  persons  upon  their return  from  court when  the \nperson  is  entitled  to  immediate release  results  in  deprivations  of Fourth \nAmendment rights. \n36.  Each proposed subclass  consists  of more  than one  hundred  persons  and \nsatisfies the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a). \n37.  The claims  asserted for  each subclass  present common questions  of fact \nand law, and plaintiffs' individual claims are typical of those asserted for \neach subclass. \n38.  Plaintiffs  are  represented  by  competent  counsel  and  will  fully  and ade \nquately represent each subclass. \n39.  Certification of each subclass  is  appropriate under Rule 23(b)(3)  because \ncommon questions predominate over individual issues and a class action is \nsuperior  to  other methods  for  the  fair  and  effective  adjudication  of the \n\n- 7 -\ncontroversy. \nDAMAGES \n40.  The above described policies of defendant, and the actions of defendant's \nagents  and  employees  taken  because  of those  policies,  caused,  or  will \ncause,  each  plaintiff and  each  member of each  proposed subclass  to  be \ndeprived of rights  secured by the Fourth  and Fourteenth Amendments  to \nthe Constitution of the United States, to be deprived of their liberty, incur \npersonal injuries, and lose wages. \n41.  Plaintiffs demand trial by jury. \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs  pray  that  the  Court  order  that  this  case  may \nproceed  as  a class  action on  behalf of the  three identified subclasses  and  that \njudgment be entered in favor of plaintiffs and each member of the plaintiff class \nfor appropriate damages in an amount in excess of twenty five thousand dollars \nas compensatory damages and that the costs of this action, including reasonable \nattorneys' fees, be taxed against defendants. \nNNETH N.

This document describes the proposed settlement and gives\ninstructions about what you must do if you believe that the proposed settlement should\nnot be approved.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe plaintiffs in this action are all persons who were in custody at the Will County\nJail on a traf๏ฌc or misdemeanor charge (or on a warrant issued for failure to appear on\na traf๏ฌc or misdemeanor charge) after May 7, 2001.  The defendants are the Sheriff of\nWill County and the Will County, Illinois.\nOn  May  12,  2004,  the  Court  ordered  that  the  case  may  proceed  as  a  class  action.\nThereafter, on April 14, 2006, the Court granted plaintiffsโ motion for summary judg-\nment and entered a ๏ฌnding of liability against the Sheriff of Will County.  On April\n14, 2006, the Court granted defendantsโ motion to certify the order granting summary\njudgment  for  an  immediate  appeal.  The  parties,  with  assistance  from  a  settlement\nattorney of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, were able to\nnegotiate a settlement.\nTHE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT\nCounsel for the parties have agreed to a settlement of all claims at issue in this case.\nWith  respect  to  the  claims  asserted  on  behalf  of  the  class,  the  plaintiff  class  will\nwaive its right to individual damage trials, defendants will waive their right to appeal\nfrom the district courtโs ๏ฌnding of liability and defendants will pay the sum of two\nmillion  one  hundred  and  ๏ฌfty  thousand  dollars  in  full  satisfaction  of  all  claims  for\ndamages,  expenses,  and  attorneysโ  fees.  Attorneysโ  fees  and  expenses  will  be  paid\n\n- 2 -\nfrom this common fund, in an amount to be set by the Court and not to exceed 40%\nof the total. The three named plaintiffs will each receive $25,000. The remainder of\nthe  fund,  less  the  costs  of  administering  the  settlement,  will  be  paid  to  each  class\nmember  in  an  equal  amount.  Class  counsel  estimates  that  each  class  member  will\nreceive at least four hundred dollars; based on experience in other, similar cases, class\ncounsel believes that each member of the each class will receive about seven hundred\ndollars.\nNOW, THEREFORE, TAKE NOTICE:\n1.  A  hearing  will  be  held  before  this  Court  in  Courtroom  1719,  United  States\nCourthouse, 219 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60604, on ______ __,\n____, at __:__ p.m., or as soon thereafter as counsel can be heard.  The hearing\nshall be for the purpose of determining whether the terms of the proposed con-\nsent decree are fair, reasonable, and adequate, and whether the proposed consent\ndecree should be approved by the Court.  This hearing may be adjourned from\ntime to time without further written notice to the class.\n2.  Any class member who wishes to be heard either in support or in opposition to\nthe proposed settlement must ๏ฌle his or her written objection or comment with\nthe Clerk of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,\n219 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60604 on or before _______ __,\n____.  The written objection or comment must be received in the Clerkโs of๏ฌce\non or before _______ __, ____.  Written objections or comments will be con-\nsidered whether or not the class member attends the hearing.\nThe foregoing references to the lawsuit and the settlement agreement are only sum-\nmaries.  The  settlement  agreement  and  all  other  papers  ๏ฌled  in  this  action  may  be\nexamined and copied in the Of๏ฌce of the Clerk, 219 South Dearborn Street, 20th ๏ฌoor,\nChicago, Illinois between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Fri-\nday.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\nEASTERN DIVISION\nJAVAR CALVIN, WILLIAM VIRBLE MOORE, )\nand CHARLES DAVIS, )\n) Case No. 03 C 3086\nPlaintiffs, )\n) Judge Virginia M. Kendall\nv. )\n)\nSHERIFF OF WILL COUNTY and WILL  )\nCOUNTY, ILLINOIS, )\n)\nDefendants. )\n)\n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nDefendants Will County and the Sheriff of Will County (collectively โDefendantsโ) request\nthat this Court amend the December 16, 2005 Memorandum Opinion and Order1 to certify the order\nfor interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง1292(b).  Because the issues raised in this appeal\nmeet the requirements for certification, the motion to amend the order is granted.\nBackground\nPlaintiffs Javar Calvin, William Virble Moore, and Charles Davis (collectively โPlaintiffsโ)\nbrought a class action suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 against Will County, Illinois and the Will County\nSheriff, alleging that Defendants violated Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment rights by conducting strip\nsearches in a Will County detention facility.   Specifically, Plaintiffs challenged Will County โPolicy\nNo. 5080,โ created by the County in response to Illinois statute 725 ILCS 5/103-1(c), which provides\nin relevant part:\n1\nThe Memorandum Opinion and Order is a published opinion. See Calvin v. Will County, 405 F. Supp. 2d\n933 (N.D. Ill. 2005).\n\n(c) No person arrested for a traffic, regulatory or misdemeanor offense, except in\nsuch cases involving weapons or a controlled substance, shall be strip searched\nunless there is reasonable belief that the individual is concealing a weapon or\ncontrolled substance. \n725 ILCS 5/103-1(c).  However, the statute later states that the provision of section (c) โshall not\napply when the person is taken into custody by or remanded to the sheriff or correctional institution\npursuant to a court order.โ  725 ILCS 5/103-1(j).\nThe Court2 certified two subclasses in the action: the โPost-Arrest Strip Searchโ subclass and\nthe โPost-Release Strip Searchโ subclass.  See December 16, 2005 Memorandum Opinion and Order\nat 2 (hereafter โMemorandum Opinionโ).  Both classes contain persons detained on misdemeanor\nor traffic offenses that did not involve weapons or controlled substances.  Both classes contain\npersons who were detained after a failure-to-appear warrant (โFTA Warrantโ) had been issued\nagainst them, and after they had been given a reasonable time to post bond and were unable or\nunwilling to do so.  After providing notice to the classes and commencing discovery, Plaintiffs\nmoved the Court to bifurcate discovery on the issues of liability and damages.  See Docket No. 39.\nThe Court granted the motion, and Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment solely on the issue of\nliability.  See Docket No. 49.\nDefendants opposed summary judgment on liability and argued that material facts existed\nmeriting trial or, in the alternative, that Defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The\nCourt determined in its Memorandum Opinion that there were no genuine issues of material fact,\nbecause Will County followed Policy No. 5080, and a Will County officer testified to the manner\n2\nAt that time, the case was assigned to a different judge in this district.  On January 23, 2006, three days\nafter Defendants filed the Motion discussed herein, the case transferred to the present judge as part of the Executive\nOrder creating the judgeโs initial calendar.  \n2\n\nof the searches and that the County conducted the strip searches on the members of the Plaintiff class\nwithout reasonable suspicion that they carried weapons or contraband.  Memorandum Opinion at\n7.  The Court concluded that the dispute could be resolved as a matter of law on the โreasonablenessโ\nof the search in light of the undisputed facts and the justifications for the policy.  The Court held as\na matter of law that the Will County policy and practice violated the Fourth Amendment and granted\nsummary judgment on liability in favor of Plaintiffs.\nWithin one month of the issuance of the Courtโs Memorandum Opinion and Order,\nDefendants filed their motion to amend the order to certify for interlocutory appeal the question of\nDefendantโs liability under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983.  See Defendantsโ Motion to Amend the Memorandum\nOpinion and Order Dated December 16, 2005 to Include Certification for Interlocutory Appeal at\n4 (hereafter โDef. Mot. Amendโ).  Defendants believe there are two โcentral issuesโ in this case\nwarranting appeal:\nThe first is whether conducting strip searches of all individuals who were\narrested under [Failure to Appear, or โFTAโ] warrants in misdemeanor and\ntraffic cases, only after they have been unable or unwilling to post bond and\nthus are required to be housed with other inmates violates a personโs Fourth\nAmendment constitutional rights.  \nThe second issue is whether conducting strip searches of all individuals who\nhad been held at the facility, taken to court for a hearing, placed in contact\nsituations  with  third-parties  outside  of  the  Countyโs  control,  ordered\nreleased by a judge, and then returned to the Facility for an [sic] processing\nof their release violates a personโs Fourth Amendment constitutional rights.\nDef. Mot. Amend at 4.  The parties have not yet conducted discovery on the issue of damages.\nLegal Standard\nA district court order not otherwise appealable may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals in\nthose cases where there exists โa controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground\n3\n\nfor difference of opinion and [where] an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance\nthe ultimate termination of the litigation.โ  28 U.S.C. ยง1292(b).  The district court may certify an\norder for interlocutory appeal at its discretion, if a request for review of this kind has been brought\nwithin a reasonable time following the entrance of the order.  Id., Richardson Elecs., Ltd. v. Panach\nBroad. Of Pennsylvania, Inc., 202 F.3d 957, 958 (7th Cir. 2000).\nDiscussion\nIn order for a district court to certify a question for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C.\nยง1292(b), โthere must be a question of law, it must be controlling, it must be contested, and its\nresolution must promise to speed up the litigation.โ Ahrenholz v. Board of Trustees of the Univ. of\nIll., 219 F.3d 674, 675 (7th Cir. 2000) (emphasis in original); see 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b).3  The Seventh\nCircuit has instructed district courts not to certify interlocutory orders under ยง 1292(b) โ[u]nless all\nthese criteria are satisfied....โ Id. at 676 (emphasis in original).  \nThe parties agree that the constitutionality of the search is controlling.  The parties also agree\nthat a reversal would speed up the litigation, because a reversal by the Court of Appeals granting\nsummary judgment for Defendants would terminate the case and obviate the need for the damages\nportion of discovery in this matter.  Therefore, the Court will focus on the two portions of the\nAhrenholz test about which the parties do not agree: whether the issue to be appealed is a question\nof law, and whether it is contested.\n3\nPlaintiffs do not dispute that Defendants met the fifth, non-statutory requirement for certification under\nSection 1292(b), that the petition for certification be filed within a reasonable time.  Ahrenholz, 219 F.3d at 675-76.   \n4\n\nA. Question of law\nA district court may certify an interlocutory order for appeal only if the appeal concerns a\nโquestion of law.โ  Ahrenholz, 219 F.3d at 677.  In order to be a โquestion of lawโ meriting\ncertification, the question should be a โreference to a question of the meaning of a statutory or\nconstitutional provision, regulation, or common law doctrineโ that โthe court of appeals could decide\nquickly and cleanly without having to study the record. . .โ Id.  \nAs a threshold matter, the order to be appealed is an order for summary judgment. As such,\nPlaintiffs argue that the mere fact that this order is one of summary judgment should render\ncertification for interlocutory appeal inappropriate  because any determination would require\nappellate review of a factual record.  See Ahrenholz, 219 F.3d at 677 (โ[T]o decide whether summary\njudgment was properly granted requires hunting through the record compiled in the summary\njudgment proceeding to see whether there may be a genuine issue of material fact lurking in there.โ).\nHowever, Defendantsโ response to the summary judgment motion did not contest the  issues\nof material fact in this case - the text of the policy, and the deposition testimony by a Will County\nofficer as to the countyโs implementation of the written policy.  Defendantsโ motion for interlocutory\nappeal essentially concedes that no material facts are in dispute, as evidenced by Defendantsโ\ndecision to  propose two โcentralโ questions to send to the court of appeals.   These  two questions,\nreprinted above, attempt to condense the Courtโs 26-page opinion into a single paragraph  that would\nqualify as โquestions of law.โ Were the appellate court to answer these two โcentralโ questions in\nDefendantsโ favor, the appellate court presumably would reverse the Court and grant summary\njudgment in favor of Defendants, rather than remanding the case for trial on the merits.  \n5\n\nWhile Defendantsโ defined issues do not accurately reflect the issues in the case because\nneither includes the uncontested fact that the Will County officers lacked reasonable suspicion of\nweapons or contraband, the fact that Defendants have moved to condense the opinion to two\nโcentralโ questions of law is sufficient basis in the Courtโs view that all parties agree that the issues\nbefore the Court at this time are โquestions of lawโ that are appropriate for resolution on appeal and\ndo not require the Court of Appeals to review the factual record any farther than the limited\nuncontested facts designated in the Memorandum Opinion.\nB.  Contested \nDefendants argue that the constitutionality of conducting blanket strip searches on pre-trial\ndetainees who were (i) charged with misdemeanor and traffic offenses, (ii) have arrest warrants for\nfailure to appear at a court hearing, (iii) are unable to post bond, and (iv) are housed in a general jail\npopulation, constitutes a โcontestedโ question of law meriting interlocutory appeal.  A question of\nlaw is contested if there exists a โsubstantial ground for difference of opinionโ concerning the legal\nquestion to be appealed: \nA question of law is contestable if there are substantial conflicting decisions\nregarding the claimed controlling issue of law, or the question is not settled by\ncontrolling authority and there is a substantial likelihood that the district court ruling\nwill be reversed on appeal.\nUnited States v. Moglia, No. 02 C 6131, 2004 WL 1254128 (N.D. Ill. June 7, 2004). \nDefendants conceded during the proceedings on summary judgment that Defendants did not\nhave  reasonable  suspicion  that  โany  of  the  class  members  had  contraband  or  weapons.โ\nMemorandum Opinion at 7.  Defendants rely on three primary facts to show that despite the lack of\nreasonable suspicion of weapons or contraband, the circumstances in Will County are different than\n6\n\nthose discussed in the controlling precedent in this circuit.  First, the county court had issued an FTA\nwarrant for each Plaintiff class member.  Second, none of the Plaintiff class members could post\nbond after a reasonable period, or in some cases refused to post bond.  Third, each of the members\nof the Plaintiff class were housed in a group detention facility while awaiting a court hearing. \nDefendants argue that each of the three elements stated above combine to justify the need to\nkeep the search policy.  Each of the class members had an outstanding FTA warrant at the time they\nwere searched, so the officers were under a duty to arrest the person and hold them until one of two\nevents occurred: either the persons posted bond, or they went before a judge.  As none of the class\nmembers could or would post bond, the officers therefore were required to hold the class members\nuntil such time as they could go before a judge.  And because Will County has general jail facilities,\nthe officers had a duty to maintain security in a general jail population.  This combination of factors,\nclaim Defendants, justify the blanket search policy codified in Policy 5080.\nDefendants claim that there exists a โsubstantial ground for difference of opinionโ with\nrespect to the search policy at issue, because there exists a split of authority between the state of\nIllinois and the Seventh Circuit with respect to these three qualifications.  Illinois amended its statute\ngoverning rights on arrest in 1981 to include the subparagraphs at issue in this case: \n(c) No person arrested for a traffic, regulatory or misdemeanor offense, except in\ncases involving weapons or a controlled substance, shall be strip searched unless\nthere is reasonable belief that the individual is concealing a weapon or controlled\nsubstance. \n(j) The provisions of subsections (c) through (h) of this Section shall not apply when\nthe person is taken into custody by or remanded to the sheriff or correctional\ninstitution pursuant to a court order. \n7\n\n725 ILCS 5/103.  Two state court opinions, each published during the last two years, explicitly\nupheld the constitutionality of the amended Illinois statute in circumstances in which a person (i) was\narrested pursuant to a civil or misdemeanor FTA, (ii) did not post bond, and (iii) had to be housed\nin a general jail population.  See People v. Mitchell, 353 Ill. App. 3d 838, 819 N.E.2d 1252 (2d Dist.\n2004); and People v. Johnson, 334 Ill. App. 3d 666, 778 N.E.2d 772 (4th Dist. 2002).  Both\nMitchell and Johnson addressed the constitutionality of 725 ILCS 5/103-1 in the context of a motion\nto suppress evidence uncovered during the searches, as opposed to the class action scenario here.\nMitchell and Johnson both held that civil or misdemeanor warrants are โcourt ordersโ that\ncomply with the Illinois statute, and the strip searches conducted for jail security did not violate the\nFourth Amendment.   In Johnson, police discovered that the passenger in a car stopped for a routine\ntraffic violation had an outstanding civil warrant.   Johnson, 334 Ill. App. 3d at 670.  Police arrested\nthe passenger pursuant to the civil warrant and strip searched him before placing him in a general\njail population, revealing illegal substances in the passengerโs possession.  Id.    The Court found that\nthe strip search was constitutional despite the police officerโs testimony that he had no reasonable\nsuspicion that the passenger had controlled substances,  because the defendant โwould be placed with\nother arrestees in a common holding areaโ and โdefendantโs placement in the general jail population\nwas imminent.โ Id.  At 674.   Likewise, the court in Mitchell upheld a strip search conducted upon\nan individual with an outstanding misdemeanor warrant, explicitly stating that the individual was\narrested not for a new offense, but โpursuant to a misdemeanor arrest warrant, which meets the โcourt\norderโ requirement of section 130-1(j).โ  Mitchell, 353 Ill. App. 3d at 840-41. \nOn the other hand, strip searches of misdemeanor traffic offenders are illegal under prevailing\nlaw in this circuit without individual suspicion that these individuals may be carrying weapons or\n8\n\ncontraband.  Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F. Supp. 486 (N.D. Ill. 1979) affirmed and adopted per curiam\n620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir. 1980) (strip searches of persons arrested and detained for non-misdemeanor\ntraffic offenses without probable cause to believe the persons are concealing weapons or contraband\nare unconstitutional); Mary Beth G v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983) (holding that\nstrip searches of misdemeanor offenders without reasonable belief that they might be carrying\ncontraband are unconstitutional).4  Defendants cannot cite to a federal case holding that the issuance\nof a bench warrant can substitute for the requirement of reasonable suspicion that an arrested\nindividual possesses weapons or contraband.\nAs the Court stated in its Memorandum Opinion: โ[I]t is difficult to reconcile prohibiting\nautomatic strip searches of people arrested on traffic and misdemeanor charges - as the Illinois\nstatute, case law, and Policy 5080 all do - with allowing the strip search of people arrested for a\nfailure to appear regarding the identical charges.โ  Memorandum Opinion at 13.   Nonetheless, this\ncontradiction has been codified in Illinois 725 ILCS 5/103(c) and (j), and has been upheld expressly\nby two recent Illinois appellate court decisions.  \nBoth decisions recognize that prison officials who are required to hold an arrestee pursuant\nto a Court order for failure to appear must be afforded the control necessary to maintain a safe and\nsecure environment for all individuals housed within their walls.  Once a court order mandates that\nthe prison official hold that arrestee, such that the prison must place the arrestee within its population\nfor an undefined period of time, the Illinois courts recognize the over-riding need to search the\n4\nDefendants rely upon Roscom v. City of Chicago, 570 F. Supp. 1259 (D.C. Ill. 1983).  Roscom upheld the\nstrip search of a person legally arrested for deceptive practices.  Specifically, Roscom stated in upholding the search\nthat โirrespective of the crimes charged against pre-trial detainees, Courts may reasonably consider any of them\ncould be carrying weapons or contraband, either brought with the detainee into the County Jail or procured from\nother persons in the holding cell.โ Id. at 1262. \n9\n\narrestee for security purposes.  No Seventh Circuit opinions have addressed the Illinois law or the\nfactual scenario at issue here, and the case law of this circuit dates from the early 1980's, in one case\nprior to the Illinois lawโs amendment.5  As such, the Court believes that this difference creates a\nโcontested issue of lawโ meriting certification for interlocutory appeal pursuant to ยง 1292(b). \nWHEREFORE, the Court finds that the Memorandum Opinion and Order of December 16,\n2005 meets the requirements for interlocutory appeal.  The Order involves an issue of law that is\ncontested and controlling, and its resolution will substantially speed the termination of the litigation.\nThe Court grants the motion of Defendants and amends the order to permit interlocutory appeal\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b).\nSo ordered.\n________________________________________\nVirginia M. Kendall, United States District Judge\nNorthern District of Illinois\nDated:  April 14, 2006\n5\nPlaintiffs cite to an unpublished recent district case from this district on point and in their favor, Gary v.\nSheahan, No. 96 C 7294, 1998 WL 547116 at *13 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 20, 1998):\n[I]f jail security is to justify the search the detainee must present some threat to jail security.  The facts\nin the cases where searches have been upheld suggest some reasonable cause on the part of the\nauthorities to suspect the detainees might be trying to smuggle weapons or contraband into the jail.\n. . A person detained for a violent crime may presumptively be suspected of carrying a weapon.\nHowever, when an arrestee is being detained briefly awaiting the posting of bond on a traffic or\nmisdemeanor offense, generally a strip-search can be made only on reasonable suspicion that the\nattestee [sic] is carrying or concealing a weapon or contraband, unless authorities can demonstrate that\nmisdemeanants regularly pose a threat to jail security.โ \n10",

Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for the deprivation of rights secured \nby the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. \nPlaintiffs have moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 for certification of three subclasses \ndefined any person \"who, from May 8, 2001 (two years before filing this action) to the date of \nentry of judgment have been, is [sic], or will be: \n1.  Arrested on an erroneous computer indication that a warrant has been issued for \nhis (or her) arrest for failure to appear in court in a misdemeanor or traffic case \nand is held overnight at the Will CountyJail; \nII.  Arrested on a warrant issued for failure to appear in a misdemeanor or traffic \ncase and, following arrival at the Will County Jail, is or was strip searched \nwithout any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that \nhe was concealing contraband or weapons. \nIII.  In the custody of the Sheriff of Will County of a traffic or misdemeanor \ncharge (or on a warrant issued for failure to appear on a traffic or misdemeanor \n(8 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 18     Filed 05/12/2004     Page 3 of 11(cid:10)\n'. \ncharge), taken to court from the Will County Jail, ordered released by the Court or \nbecame entitled to release because the charge on which he (or she) was being held \nwas no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on \nhis (or her) own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time served, \nwas acquitted or was otherwise entitled to release, was not the subject of any other \npending case or cases which imposed any condition of release other than personal \nrecognizance, was not the subject of any detainer or warrant, was returned in \nshackles to the Will County Jail to be processed out ofthe custody of the Sheriff \nof Will County, and Was [sic] strip searched without any individualized finding of \nreasonable suspicion that he (or she) was concealing contraband or weapons.\" \nDefendants oppose certification, arguing that: (1) subclass I does not satisfY the \nnumerosity requirements of Rule 23(a); (2) subclass II does not satisfy the typicality requirement \nof Rule 23(a); and subclasses II and III do not have a question oflaw or fact common to the class \nthat predominates over individual questions of law or fact, thus failing to satisfY Rule 23(b )(3). \nFACTS \nAccording to plaintiffs' second amended complaint, each plaintiff was arrested because \ndefendants maintained records that mistakenly indicated an outstanding arrest warrant when no \nsuch warrant actually existed.  Upon arrival at the Will County Adult Detention Facility \n(\"WCADF\"Y, each member was allegedly strip searched pursuant to the Sheriffs policy. \nPlaintiffs Calvin and Moore repeatedly protested their arrests, insisting that they had no \noutstanding warrants.  Within two days of each plaintiff s arrest, a judge concluded that each \ndetention was in error and ordered each plaintiff released.  After the release orders issued, \nWCADF personnel allegedly maintained each plaintiff in handcuffs and shackles and returned \nIPlaintiffs references to \"Will County Jail\" in the definition of their subclasses have been \nreplaced with \"Will County Adult Detention Facility,\" which defendants submit is the proper \nname of the facility to which plaintiffs were taken. \n2 \n,. . \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 18     Filed 05/12/2004     Page 4 of 11(cid:10)\nhim to WCADF.  At the WCADF, personnel allegedly strip searched each plaintiff, returning \nhim to a detention cell for several hours until his eventual release that day. \nPlaintiffs contend that defendants' failure to use a more accurate system caused incorrect \nwarrants to issue unchecked, thus amounting to deliberate indifference and the umeasonable \ndetention of subclass I plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs also maintain that the Sheriff s policy that allowed \nstrip searches without reasonable suspicion that the arrestee possessed concealed contraband or \nweapons deprived each subclass II plaintiff of his Fourth Amendment rights.  Last, plaintiffs \ncontend that the Sheriffs policy of shackling and strip searching persons who were entitled to \nimmediate release deprived each subclass III plaintiff of his Fourth Amendment rights. \nDISCUSSION \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23 requires a two step analysis to detennine whether a class should be \ncertified.  First, Rule 23(a) requires plaintiffs to demonstrate: (1) numerosity; (2) commonality; \n(3) typicality; and (4) adequacy ofrepresentation.  Harriston v. Chicago Tribune Co., 992 F.2d \n697,703 (7th Cir. 1993).  Second, one of Rule 23(b)'s conditions must be satisfied.  Cwiak v. \nFlint Ink Corp., 186 F.R.D. 494, 496 (N.D. Ill. 1999).  In the instant case, Rule 23(b)(3) requires \nplaintiffs to demonstrate that: \"1) common questions must predominate over any questions \naffecting only individual members; and 2) class re~olution must be superior to other methods for \nthe fair and effective adjudication of the controversy.\" Portis v. City of Chicago, 2003 WL \n22078279, *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8,2003) (quoting Joncek v. Local 714 International of Teamsters \nHealth and Welfare Fund, 1999 WL 755051, *7 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 3, 1999ยป.  Plaintiffs have the \nburden of showing compliance with Rule 23.  Cwiak, 186 F.R.D. at 496.  Defendants challenge \ncertification of each subclass on different grounds. \n3 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 18     Filed 05/12/2004     Page 5 of 11(cid:10)\n, '-\n1. Subclass J - The \"Bad Warrant\" Subclass \nDefendants oppose certification of subclass I, the \"bad warrant\" subclass, arguing that \nplaintiffs fail to demonstrate numerosity.  A class may be certified only if the class is so \nnumerous as to make joinder ofall members impracticable.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); Cwiak, at \n496.  Defendants contend that discovery shows only a handful of potential class members, \nnamely the specific plaintiffs and a few other possible, yet unnamed, members.  Defendants point \nto Sergeant Vitek's deposition testimony that, in his opinion, over the past four years, the \nSheriffs records probably show less than five instances of a quashed warrant arrest. \nPlaintiffs contend that at least 75 people compose the first subclass, emphasizing the \ndeposition testimony of Sergeant Brian Fink, who acknowledged that, perhaps as often as once a \nweek, \"a person [is] brought into the jail on a warrant and says that, 'That warrant was quashed; I \nshouldn't be here. \", Sergeant Fink added, however, that \"everybody says that the warrant isn't \nany good.\"  Plaintiffs also direct the court's attention to plaintiff Davis' deposition, in which he \ntestified that the judge who ordered his release said he was \"about the 201 st person coming in \nhere getting falsely arrested.\" \nThe Fink and Davis deposition excerpts do not persuade the court that the first subclass \nis sufficiently numerous to merit class treatment.  The Fink deposition testimony addresses only \nhow many people complain that they have been brought in invalid warrants; his testimony does \nnot address the number of warrants that actually were quashed. The only evidence before the \ncourt regarding the number of actual quashed warrant arrests, which was provided by defendant, \nindicates that there have been only five incidents.  Plaintiffs concede that five incidents alone do \nnot satisfY the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a). \n4 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 18     Filed 05/12/2004     Page 6 of 11(cid:10)\nAlthough plaintiffs are not required to show the exact number of people included in the \nproposed class, Cwiak, 186 F.R.D. at 494, the impracticability of joinder must be established by \nmore than mere speculation.  See id. at 496 (\"[I]mpracticability of joinder must be positively \nshown, and carmot be speculative.\") (citations omitted).  The court thus denies plaintiffs' motion \nto certify subclass I.  If further discovery reveals a greater number of actual quashed warrant \narrests that would satisfy the numerosity requirement, however, plaintiffs may renew their \nmotion to certify subclass I. \n2.  Subclass II - The \"Post-Arrest Strip Search\" Subclass \nDefendants oppose certification of subclass II, the \"post-arrest strip search\" subclass, \narguing that plaintiffs fail to demonstrate, (1) typicality, and (2) a common question oflaw or \nfact that predominates over individual issues.  The court addresses each of these arguments in \nturn below. \nA class may be certified only if the claims of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3); De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d \n225,232 (7th Cir. 1983).  Defendants argue that the class definition is overbroad and indefinite, \nthus making it too difficult for the court to \"determine whether a particular individual is a \nmember of the proposed class.\"  See Clay v. American Tobacco Co., 188 F.R.D. 483, 490 \n(S.D.1l1. 1999).  In arguing that the class is indefinite, defendants hypothesize a split in the class \nbetween those members who were strip searched and released on bond and those members who \nwere strip searched and admitted as WCADF imnates. \nThe court fails to see how the interests of the named plaintiffs, who were strip searched \nprior to being admitted as imnates, are not aligned with the interests of those class members who \n5 \n'ยท',1',\" \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 18     Filed 05/12/2004     Page 7 of 11(cid:10)\nwere strip searched prior to posting bail.  Plaintiffs are challenging the policy of strip searching \neach person arrested on a warrant for failure to appear in a misdemeanor or traffic case without \nfirst making an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he or she \nwas concealing contraband or weapons.  According to plaintiffs, the strip searches allegedly \noccurred \"upon arrival,\" and the challenged policy applied to every arrestee regardless of whether \nhe was later released on bond or admitted as a WCADF inmate. As plaintiffs point out, every \nmember of the \"post-arrest strip search\" subclass advances the same claim that the Sheriffs \nuniforru strip search policy (specifically, to strip search all persons arrested on \"failure to appear\" \nwarrants) is unconstitutional as applied to persons in custody on warrants issued in traffic and \nmisdemeanor cases.  The court thus concludes that plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality \nrequirement. \nDefendants further argue that, even if sufficiently definite, certification of subclass II \nshould be denied because it fails to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirement that questions oflaw or \nfact common to the members of the class must predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual members.  According to defendants, \"Requiring this court to make an individualized \ndeterruination of the constitutionality of the search conducted by WCADF personnel, as applied \nto each potential class member, renders the proposed second subclass unmanageable.\"  In this \nvein, defendants argue that the deterruination of whether a person is a member of subclass II \ncarmot be made without hearing evidence on the circumstances of each person's arrest and \nsearch, which would include an individualized inquiry into whether there was reasonable \nsuspicion that each class member had some hidden drugs or weapons at the time of the search. \n6 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 18     Filed 05/12/2004     Page 8 of 11(cid:10)\nDefendants misconceive the way in which reasonable suspicion factors into the class. \nPlaintiffs allege that under the uniform strip search policy adopted by the Sheriff, j ail personnel \nnever undertook reasonable suspicion or probable cause inquiries.  Thus, the ultimate legal \nquestion is not whether jail personnel made erroneous reasonable suspicion determinations \nregarding each individual, but whether the Sheriffs policy avoided all such inquiry, thus \ndepriving those individuals of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The question of \nthe validity of the Sheriffs policy thus predominates over any \"individualized questions.\"  See \nBlihovde v. St. Croix County. Wis., 219 F.R.D. 607, 620 (W.D. Wis. 2003) (\"[T]he case law \nsuggests that when the class is challenging a uniform policy, the validity of that policy \npredominates over individual issues and class certification is appropriate\")?  See also Mack v. \nSuffolk County,191 F.R.D. 16,24 (D.Mass. 2000) (\"To require plaintiffto prove that each \nindividual search was unsupportable, as well as indiscriminate, would be unnecessary and unfair. \nGiven that these [persons] were routinely strip searched, the burden rests on defendants to \ndemonstrate that particular searches were reasonable.\") (citing Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 754 F. \nSupp. 1211 (ND.Ill. 1990)). \nFor these reasons, the court certifies subclass II as: \nAs plaintiffs point out, the proposed class definition excludes persons who were strip \n2 \nsearched based on \"reasonable suspicion.\" Accordingly, in the event that defendants believe that \nspecific searches or classes of searches had a reasonable antecedent justification, defendants are \nnot precluded from offering proof that the subjects of those searches should be excluded from the \nclass.  See, e.g., Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 754 F. Supp. 1211, 1220 (N.D.Ill. 1990).  Because \nSheriffs Policy and Procedure ยง 5080 requires elaborate documentation of strip searches \nconducted on the basis of \"reasonable belief' that the imnate is concealing contraband or \nweapons, identifying such individuals should not be overly burdensome or require extensive \nfactfinding by the parties. \n7 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 18     Filed 05/12/2004     Page 9 of 11(cid:10)\n>. \nAny person who, from May 8, 200 I, to the date of entry of judgment has been, is, or will \nbe: \nArrested on a warrant issued for failure to appear in a misdemeanor \nor traffic case and, following arrival at the Will County Adult \nDetention Facility, is or was strip searched without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause \nthat he or she was concealing contraband or weapons. \n3.  Subclass III -The \"Post-Release Strip Search\" Subclass - Rule 23(b)(3) \nDefendants oppose certification of subclass ill, the \"post-release strip search\" subclass, \narguing that plaintiffs fail to demonstrate \"that the questions oflaw or fact common to the \nmembers of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and \nthat a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of \nthe controversy.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \nPlaintiffs claim deprivation ofliberty, personal injuries and lost wages as damages in the \ninstant case.  Defendants argue that personal injuries and lost wages are individualized questions \naccording to each proposed subclass member's particular circumstances.  Defendants concede \nthat certification of a class can be correct even if the class members are entitled to different levels \nof injury and damages.  De La Fuente, 713 F.2d at 233; Gal}' v. Sheahan, 1999 WL 281347 (N.D. \nIll. March 31,1999). Nonetheless, defendants argue that certification in the instant case is \nimproper because plaintiffs fail to present detailed evidence that each member's injuries would \nbe of similar type and severity. \nAccording to defendants, the level of psychological trauma inflicted on each class \nmember varies depending on the individual's particular mental state prior to the strip search \n(pointing to the difference in the reaction of a first-time arrestee and that of one arrested on \n8 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 18     Filed 05/12/2004     Page 10 of 11(cid:10)\nnumerous prior occasions and familiar with the process).  The fact that damages may vary based \non each plaintiff s mental state is not, however, a sufficient reason to deny certification, because \nthe court may bifurcate the lawsuit so that liability is determined first.  If defendants are found \nliable, the court may then revisit the damages issue, including whether to certify another class or \nsubclasses, or hold individual hearings, for the purpose of resolving damages.  Blihovde, 219 \nF.R.D. at 621 (citing Denberg v. United States R. Retirement Bd., 696 F.2d 1193, 1207 & n.7 \n(7th Cir. 1983)).  See also Portis v. City of Chicago, 2003 WL 22078279, *3 (N.D. Ill. 2003) \n(\"[T]he possibility of individualized damage inquiries does not defeat class certification even if \nindividual hearings ultimately may be required.\") (quoting Williams v. Rizza Chevrolet-Geo. \nInc., 2000 WL263731, at *3 (N.D. Ill. 2000)). \nDefendants' remaining argument for denying certification of subclass III challenges \"the \npossibility that plaintiffs believe they should have been released directly from the courthouse\" \nrather than being returned to the WCADF general population for processing, which entitles \ndefendants to strip search the inmates for contraband.  Defendants argue that the returning \ninmates cannot be held in a holding cell because they must be allowed to collect their personal \nbelongings from their cells in general population.  Plaintiffs respond that persons arrested on \nwarrants are unlikely to have personal property to collect upon release because their property is \n\"taken from [them] and held in the property room\" rather than their cells.  Because this factual \ndispute goes directly to the merits of plaintiffs' challenge of the Sheriffs policy of returning \nreleased inmates to general population (and thus subjecting all of them to strip searches), it is \npremature. \"[A] court may not refuse to certify a class on the ground that it thinks the class will \neventually lose on the merits.\"  Loeb Industries. Inc. v. Sumitomo COl]?, 306 F.3d 469, 480 (71h \n9 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 18     Filed 05/12/2004     Page 11 of 11(cid:10)\nCif. 2002) (citing Eisen v. Carlisle and Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1974)).  Accordingly, \nthe court need not decide whether the Sheriff s policy passes muster before certifying subclass \nIII. \nFor these reasons, the court certifies subclass III3 as: \nAny person who, from May 8,2001, to the date of entry of judgment has been, is, or will \nbe: \nIn the custody of the Sheriff of Will County on a traffic or \nmisdemeanor charge (or on a warrant issued for failure to appear \non a traffic or misdemeanor charge), taken to court from the Will \nCounty Adult Detention Facility, ordered released by the court, or \notherwise became entitled to immediate release, was returned to \nthe Will County Adult Detention Facility to be processed out of the \ncustody of the Sheriff of Will County, and was strip searched \nwithout any individualized finding ofreasonable suspicion that he \nor she was concealing contraband or weapons. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, plaintiffs' motion for class certification is granted with \nrespect to subclasses II and III, and denied with respect to subclass 1.  This matter is set for a \nreport on status on May 26,2004, at 9:00 a.m. \nENTER:  May 12, 2004 \nRobert W. Gettleman \nUnited States District Jndge \n3In the interest of clarity, the court, sua sponte, has simplified the definition of subclass \nIII. \n10 ",

Following the grant of permission to appeal by the Seventh Circuit from\nthe  order  granting  summary  judgment  on  liability,  the  parties,  with  the\ninvaluable assistance of Joel N. Shapiro, Senior Conference Attorney of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, have entered\ninto a \"class settlement agreement,\" a copy of which is attached to this\nmotion.\n2.

Nature of litigation.  Plaintiffs filed the above captioned action, for \nthemselves and all others similarly situated, in the United States District Court for \nthe Northern District of Illinois alleging violations of their Fourth Amendment \nrights under the U.S. Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, resulting from \nstrip searches conducted of them at the Will County Adult Detention Facility \n(โWCADFโ).\n2. Class Certification.  Pursuant to the Court's order of May 12, 2004, \nthis case is proceeding as a class action for two subclasses defined as follows:\nAny person who, from May 8, 2001, to the date of entry of \njudgment has been, is, or will be arrested on a warrant issued for \nfailure to appear in a misdemeanor or traffic case and, following \narrival at the Will County Adult Detention Facility, is or was strip \nsearched without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 80     Filed 09/15/2006     Page 4 of 12(cid:10)\nor probable cause that he or she was concealing contraband or \nweapons. (โSubclass Iโ)\nand\nAny person who, from May 8, 2001, to the date of entry of \njudgment has been, is, or will be in the custody of the Sheriff of \nWill County on a traffic or misdemeanor charge (or on a warrant \nissued for failure to appear on a traffic or misdemeanor charge), \ntaken to court from the Will County Adult Detention Facility, \nordered released by the court, or otherwise became entitled to \nimmediate   release,   was   returned  to   the   Will   County   Adult \nDetention Facility to be processed out of the custody of the Sheriff \nof Will County, and was strip searched without any individualized \nfinding of reasonable suspicion that he or she was concealing \ncontraband or weapons. (โSubclass IIโ).\n3. Important Rulings.   On December 16, 2005, the Court granted \nplaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and entered a finding of liability against \ndefendant Sheriff of Cook County and in favor of Subclass One and Subclass \nTwo.  Thereafter, on April 14, 2006, the Court granted defendants' motion to \ncertify the order granting summary judgment for an interlocutory appeal pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. ยง1292(b). The Court of Appeals granted permission to appeal on May \n18, 2006.\n4. Settlement Conference. In accordance with Seventh Circuit Rule \n33, the parties participated in a Settlement Conference with Joel N. Shapiro, \nSenior Conference Attorney of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh \nCircuit.  With the invaluable assistance of Mr. Shapiro, the parties have agreed to a \nresolution of their disputes in this action.  The class members desire to settle their \nclaims against Defendant, having taken into account through their counsel the \nrisks, delay and difficulties involved in establishing a right to recovery in excess of \n2\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 80     Filed 09/15/2006     Page 5 of 12(cid:10)\nthat offered by this settlement and the likelihood that the litigation will be further \nprotracted and expensive.   Class Counsel has investigated the facts and the \napplicable law.  Based on the foregoing, and upon an analysis of the benefits that \nthis Settlement Agreement affords the class, Class Counsel considers it to be in the \nbest interest of the class to enter into this Settlement Agreement.\n5. No Admission of Liability.  Defendants deny liability to Plaintiffs \nand the class for the claims alleged, but consider it desirable that the action and the \nclaims alleged therein be settled upon the terms and conditions set forth in this \nAgreement, in order to avoid further expense and burdensome, protracted \nlitigation, and to put to rest all claims, known or unknown, that have been or might \nbe asserted by Plaintiffs or the class members against Defendant. \nIn consideration of the foregoing,  Plaintiffs, Class Counsel and Defendants \nstipulate and agree that the claims of the named Plaintiffs and the class against \nDefendants should be and are hereby compromised and settled, subject to the \napproval of the court, upon the following terms and conditions.\nTERMS\n6. Relief to the Class.   To resolve all claims at issue in this case, \nincluding but not limited to claims for compensatory damages and claims for \nattorneys' fees and expenses, the parties have agreed that, as part of the \nconsideration   for   this   Agreement,   including   the   releases   contained  herein, \nDefendants agree to pay a total amount of $2,150,000 (Two Million One Hundred \n3\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 80     Filed 09/15/2006     Page 6 of 12(cid:10)\nand Fifty Thousand Dollars) (โSettlement Fundโ) in full settlement of all claims by \nall members of both subclasses. With respect to all claims asserted on behalf of \neach subclass, plaintiffs have agreed to waive their right to individual damage \ntrials.  The defendants have agreed to waive their right to appeal from the district \ncourt's finding of liability.  \n7. Incentive Payments.   Each of the named plaintiffs will receive, \nsubject to the approval of the court, an incentive award of $25,000 to be paid from \nthe Settlement Fund.    Defendants agree not to oppose Plaintiffsโ petition for such \nincentive awards. Such awards shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any other \nawards to which the named plaintiffs may be entitled under this settlement. \n8. Administration, Attorneysโ Fees and Expenses.  The cost of \nadministration of the settlement will be paid from the Settlement Fund, as will \nattorneysโ fees and expenses.  These costs include, but are not limited to, notice to \nthe class, attempting to locate class members who are not reached by first class \nmail to their last known address, processing of claim forms and 1099 forms, \nissuance of settlement checks, and mailing (by certified mail, return reply \nrequested) of settlement shares to class members.   The settlement will be \nadministered by  Analytics, Incorporated, who has provided these services in \nsimilar cases and who has previously been engaged by class counsel in this case \nfor the mailing of class notice. The total amount of attorneys' fees and reimbursed \nexpenses will not exceed 40% of the total Settlement Fund, in an amount to be set \nby the Court.  Defendants have agreed not to challenge any such request for fees \n4\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 80     Filed 09/15/2006     Page 7 of 12(cid:10)\nand reimbursement of expenses that may be made by class counsel.  Class counsel \nintends to seek a total award of fees and reimbursement of expenses in an amount \nnot to exceed forty percent of the total settlement in accord with the standard in the \ncommunity of contingent fees ranging between one-third and 40% of the total \nrecovery, with the higher percentage applying in risky cases and in those with a \nlikelihood of a small recovery. The parties are in agreement that, subject to the \napproval of the Court, one-third of the total settlement plus reimbursement for the \nactual cost of class notice and the actual cost of notice of this proposed settlement \nshall be paid to class counsel as fees and reimbursable expenses and that any \nbalance remaining in the โReserve Fundโ (as described below) on December 1, \n2007 shall be paid to class counsel as additional fees.\n9. Payments to Class Members.  The parties, while recognizing that \neach class member has a distinct claim for damages, agree that the expense, \nuncertainty, and delay of providing each class member with an individual \ndetermination of damages outweighs the benefits of distribution on an pro rata \nbasis.  After the deduction of attorneyโs fees and reimbursable expenses, the costs \nof administration of this settlement, and the incentive awards to the named \nPlaintiffs,  the remainder of the Settlement Fund (hereinafter the โNet Settlementโ) \nwill be distributed to each class member who has not excluded him or herself, and \nwho timely returns a claim form.  Each class member who submits a timely claim \nform will receive a payment from the balance of the Settlement Fund based upon \nthe procedures described below.  The amount that each unnamed member of the \n5\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 80     Filed 09/15/2006     Page 8 of 12(cid:10)\nplaintiff class will receive cannot be computed until there has been a final \ndetermination of the number of class members who timely return a claim form; \nbased on experience in other, similar cases, counsel for the parties estimate that \neach class member will receive an award greater than four hundred dollars ($400) \nand less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n10. Notice and Claims Procedures.  \na. Within seven days after the Court has given its preliminary approval \nto this proposed settlement, notice of the proposed settlement, information about \nthe date and time of the fairness hearing, and notice of a right to opt-out (for those \nmembers that have not previously received such opportunity) will be sent by first \nclass mail to the last ascertainable address of each member of subclass one and \nsubclass two. As used herein, โascertainableโ means the last known address as \nenhanced by the United States Postal Service change of address database.  For any \nnotice which is returned as undeliverable, reasonable efforts will be made to locate \nthe class member using industry standard address correction procedures.  The cost \nof this notice will be paid in the first instance by Plaintiffs and, assuming that this \nsettlement obtains final approval from the Court, will be reimbursed from the total \namount of the settlement.\nb. The notice of the proposed settlement will be accompanied by a \n1099 form and a claim form that includes the release described below. Class \nmembers will be required   to return the executed forms to the class action \n6\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 80     Filed 09/15/2006     Page 9 of 12(cid:10)\nadministrator on or before December 1, 2006. Late claimants may receive payment \nunder the provisions of subparagraph (e) below. \nc. Within 7 days of the โFinal Approval Date,โ as defined below, the \ntotal amount of the settlement shall be transferred by defendants to an IOLTA \nclient trust fund account maintained within the State of Illinois by class counsel. \nAs used herein, โFinal Approval Dateโ means the 31st day following entry of the \norder approving the settlement or, if there is an appeal, when the Court's order \napproving the settlement reaches a final adjudication.\nd. Efforts to locate class members will continue through the date of the \nfairness hearing. \ne. On or before December 18, 2006, payments will be made to each \nclass member who has timely returned the 1099 form and claim form. A claim \nform shall be deemed timely it is received by the class action administrator on or \nbefore December 1, 2006. The amount of these payments will be computed by \ndividing the โNet Settlementโ less a โReserve Fundโ by the number of timely \nclaimants. One fifteenth (1/15) of the โNet Settlementโ shall be set aside as the \nโReserve Fundโ and will be maintained by class counsel in an IOLTA account \nwithin the State of Illinois.\nf. The โReserve Fundโ will be used to pay claims of class members \nwho submit claim forms and 1099 form to the class action administrator on or \nbefore the earlier of December 1, 2007 or the date that the reserve fund is \n7\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 80     Filed 09/15/2006     Page 10 of 12(cid:10)\nexhausted. Each such claimant will be paid in the same collar amount as the claims \npaid pursuant to subparagraph (e) above. In the event that the reserve fund is \ninsufficient to pay the full amount to each claimant whose claim form and 1099 \nform is received on the day on which the fund is exhausted, each such claimant \nwill receive an aliquot share of the balancing remaining in the fund.\ng. No part of the โReserve Fundโ will be returned to defendants.\nh. Any balance remaining in the โReserve Fundโ on December 1, 2007 \nshall be paid to class counsel as additional fees.\n12. Release.   Plaintiffs and the members of the class will grant \nDefendants the following release:\nPlaintiffs and each class member do hereby release and forever discharge the \nDefendants, and their present or former parents, officers, directors, partners, \nmembers, principals, insurers, insureds, representatives, employees, agents, \nservants, predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, and \nassigns (\"Released Parties\") of and from all causes of action, suits, claims and \ndemands, whatsoever, for anything that occurred from the beginning of time up \nthrough and including the date the Court gives final approval to this settlement \nagreement, in law or in equity, known or unknown at this time, arising out of all \nof the factual allegations made in the above-captioned action, under any legal \ntheory.   This release is conditioned on the final approval of the Settlement \nAgreement by the Court and Defendant meeting its obligations therein. \n13. Enforcement and Reservation of Jurisdiction.  The parties agree \nthat the Court will reserve jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this agreement \n8\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 80     Filed 09/15/2006     Page 11 of 12(cid:10)\nand that the Court may, for good cause, adjust and reset the dates set out in \nparagraph 10 above. \nAgreed to, this 15th day of September, 2006.\n/s/ Kenneth N.

Plaintiffs  had  intended  to  support  their  summary  judgment  motion  with  data\n(sought in an outstanding discovery request) about the number of times in which\ncontraband  had  been  discovered  either  in  a  strip  search  of  persons  arrested  on\nwarrants in misdemeanor cases and in a strip search of a person returning from\ncourt after that personโs release had been ordered. See Mary Beth G. v. City of\nChicago, 723  F.2d  1263,  1274  (7th  Cir.  1983)  (\"The  City  introduced  several\naf๏ฌdavits of security personnel and one statistical survey in an attempt to show that\nweapons  and  contraband  can  be  and  have  been  concealed  in  the  vagina.\")  The\nCourt indicated that plaintiffs could obtain this data if required to respond to the\nSheriffโs defense of his policies.\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 2 of 13(cid:10)\n- 2 -\ninterrogatories, and admissions on ๏ฌle, together with the af๏ฌdavits, if any, show\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" See, e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248\n(1986); Waite v. Board of Trustees of Illinois Community College District No.\n508, 408 F.3d 339, 345 (7th Cir. 2005).  This rule is properly applied to this\ncase because all of the material facts concerning the Sheriffโs challenged policies\nare undisputed.\nI.  THE POLICIES CHALLENGED BY THE CLASS\nThis case involves two policies of the Sheriff of  Will  County:  the  ๏ฌrst\npolicy mandates the strip search of any person arrested on a warrant issued for\nfailure  to  appear  in  a  misdemeanor,  ordinance  violation,  or  traf๏ฌc  case.  The\nsecond policy requires the strip search of all persons following a court appear-\nance at which their release is ordered. Each policy is challenged by a subclass\nthat the Court certi๏ฌed under Rule 23(b)(3) in its order of May 12, 2004:\nSubclass One  Any  person  who,  from  May  8,  2001,  to  the  date  of\nentry of judgment has been, is, or will be arrested on a\nwarrant issued for failure to appear in a misdemeanor\nor  traf๏ฌc  case  and,  following  arrival  at  the  Will\nCounty  Adult  Detention  Facility,  is  or  was  strip\nsearched without any individualized ๏ฌnding of reason-\nable  suspicion  or  probable  cause  that  he  or  she  was\nconcealing contraband or weapons.\nSubclass  Two  Any  person  who,  from  May  8,  2001,  to  the  date  of\nentry of judgment has been, is, or will be in the cus-\ntody of the Sheriff of Will County on a traf๏ฌc or mis-\ndemeanor charge (or on a warrant issued for failure to\nappear on a traf๏ฌc or misdemeanor charge), taken to\ncourt from the Will County Adult Detention Facility,\nordered  released  by  the  court,  or  otherwise  became\nentitled to immediate release, was returned to the Will\nCounty Adult Detention Facility to be processed out of\nthe  custody  of  the  Sheriff  of  Will  County,  and  was\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 3 of 13(cid:10)\n- 3 -\nstrip  searched  without  any  individualized  ๏ฌnding  of\nreasonable  suspicion  that  he  or  she  was  concealing\ncontraband or weapons.\nWe show below that the policy challenged by each sub-class is undisputed\nand unconstitutional.\nII.  THE FACTS MATERIAL TO THE SHERIFFโS POLICIES ARE\nUNDISPUTED\nThe Sheriffโs strip search policies are contained in \"Policy #5080\" of the\n\"Will County Adult Detention Facility Policy and Procedures.\" (Plaintiffsโ Rule\n56.1 Statement, par. 4.)  These policies were explained at a Rule 30(b)(6) depo-\nsition by Sergeant Brian Fink.2 (Fink Dep. 3, Plaintiffโs Exhibit 2.)\nThe  strip  search  conducted  at  the  Will  County  jail  is  de๏ฌned  in  Policy\n#5080 as a \"visual body cavity search.\" (Plaintiffsโ Rule 56.1 Statement, par. 5.)\nSergeant Fink provided details about this type of search at the Sheriffโs Rule\n30(B)(6) deposition (Plaintiffsโ Rule 56.1 Statement, par. 6):\nDefense Counsel:  Can you explain for us the practice?\nSergeant Fink:  First off, we explain to the inmates that we have to do a\nstrip search before you return back to the jail population\nand we are going to ask you to please cooperate with\nus.  First off we would ask the inmate to remove each\n__ ____________\n2. Sergeant Fink was an appropriate person to have been designated by the Sheriff to\nexplain  the  strip  search  policies  โ  Fink  is  the  author  of  the  written  policy,\n(Plaintiffsโ Exhibit 2, Fink Dep. 5), and he testi๏ฌed \"concerning a matter within the\nscope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.\"\nFed.R.Evid 801(d)(2)(D).\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 4 of 13(cid:10)\n- 4 -\nlayer of clothing individually and to shake it out in front\nof  us,  or  in  some  cases  to  hand  it  to  us  to  actually\nsearch the pockets.\nOnce the inmate has removed all of his clothing, he is\ninstructed  to  โ  Now  the  [47]  clothing  โ  or  he  has\nnothing on.  The inmate is instructed to show his hands\nso he is not โ we know that he has not taken anything\nout of his clothing during the time he was handling it.\nShow the front, the back, the palms, to lift his arms to\nbe able to examine underneath his arms, to then take his\nhands and run them behind his ears, and then to take his\nhands  and  bend  forward  and  shake  his  hair  out\nvigorously.\nThen  he  is  once  again  asked  to  show  his  hands.  The\ninmate is then told to please turn around and to show\nthe  bottoms  of  his  feet,  and  then  to  bend  over  and\nspread the cheeks of his buttocks with his hands. He is\nthen asked to then stand straight up again, turn around,\nface the of๏ฌcer, and to life his genitals. At that time we\nwould  then  ask  to  see  his  hands  again,  and  then  we\nallow the inmate to redress.\nThe Sheriffโs written policy requires \"a reasonable belief that the inmate is\ncarrying contraband or other prohibited material\" before a \"visual body cavity\nsearch\" may be performed.  (Plaintiffsโ Rule 56.1 Statement, par. 7.) This policy\nmay well be constitutional if it required an individual determination that there\nwas \"reasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee or detainee\" is concealing\nweapons or drugs. Thompson v. The County of Cook, No. 03 C 7172, N.D.Ill.\n(Mem.Op.,  August  8,  2005,  15.)  The  Sheriff,  however,  does  not  require  any\nindividual determination of reasonable suspicion in the two settings challenged\nin this case.\nThe Sheriffโs policy assumes that there is a \"reasonable belief\" that a per-\nson is carrying contraband whenever that person has been arrested on a warrant.\n(Plaintiffsโ Rule 56.1 Statement, par. 8.)  Accordingly, the Sheriff mandates a\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 5 of 13(cid:10)\n- 5 -\nstrip search of every person arrested on a warrant even when the warrant had\nbeen issued in a traf๏ฌc, ordinance/regulatory or misdemeanor case.  (Id.)\nSubclass One challenges this presumption, asserting that it is not reason-\nable to assume that a person arrested on a warrant will have sought to hide con-\ntraband in a spot where it can only be discovered by a strip search.\nThe Sheriff also assumes that there is \"a reasonable belief that the inmate\nis carrying contraband or other prohibited material\" whenever a prisoner returns\nto the jail from a court appearance.  (Plaintiffsโ Rule 56.1 Statement, par. 9.)\nOn this presumption, the Sheriff requires that all inmates returning from court\nbe strip searched, including those who are to be immediately released.  (Plain-\ntiffsโ Rule 56.1 Statement, par. 10.)  Subclass Two contends that this presump-\ntion is not rationally related to any legitimate penological purpose when  it  is\napplied to detainees, like those in Subclass Two, who are about to be released.\nIII.  THE SHERIFFโS POLICIES ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL\nUnder Fourth Amendment principles that the Seventh Circuit approved in\nits af๏ฌrmance of Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir. 1980), and applied in\nMary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983), the policies\nchallenged in this case are unconstitutional.\nTinetti v. Wittke arose from a policy of the Racine County jail to require\nthe strip search of persons arrested for non-misdemeanor traf๏ฌc offenses \"due to\nan  unwillingness  or  inability  to  post  bond  before  their  initial  appearance  in\ncourt.\" 620 F.2d at 160.  The Court of Appeals noted that \"[t]he search were\nconducted  despite  the  absence  of  any  probable  cause  to  believe  that  the\ndetainees  were  concealing  contraband  or  weapons  on  their  bodies.\" Id.  The\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 6 of 13(cid:10)\n- 6 -\ndistrict  court  found  the  strip  search  policy  to  be  an  unreasonable  invasion  of\nprivacy,  479  F.Supp.  486,  491  (E.D.Wis.  1979),  and  the  Seventh  Circuit\naf๏ฌrmed on the district courtโs opinion.  620 F.2d at 161.\nThe  Seventh  Circuit  extended  this  reasoning  beyond \"non-misdemeanor\ntraf๏ฌc offenses\" to misdemeanor charges in Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,\n723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983).  The Court of Appeals carefully analyzed the\ndifference between a \"full search\" and a strip search, 723 F.2d at 1269-70, and\nconcluded that \"the strip searches bore an insubstantial relationship to security\nneeds so that, when balanced against plaintiffs-appelleesโ privacy interests, the\nsearches  cannot  be  considered  โreasonable.โ\" (citation  omitted)  723  F.2d  at\n1273.\nDistrict courts have applied these principles to invalidate strip search prac-\ntices at the Calumet City police department, Doe v. Calumet City, 754 F.Supp.\n1211,  1220  (N.D.Ill.  1990),  and  at  the  Cook  County  jail. Gary  v.  Sheahan,\n1998 WL 547116 (No. 96 C 7294, N.D.Ill. August 20, 1998).  This circuit does\nnot stand alone on this issue: each circuit that has considered the question has\nconcluded  that  a  person  arrested  on  a  misdemeanor  charge  may  not  be  strip\nsearched upon being placed in the general jail population unless there is reason-\nable suspicion to believe that he (or she) is concealing a weapon or other contra-\nband. Savard v. Rhode  Island, 320  F.3d  34,  39-40  (1st  Cir.  2003); Shain  v.\nEllison, 273 F.3d 56, 64-66 (2d Cir. 2001); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007,\n1013 (4th Cir. 1981); Watt v. City of Richardson, 849 F.2d 195 198-99 (5th Cir.\n1988); Masters  v.  Crouch, 872  F.2d  1248,  1355  (6th  Cir.  1989); Jones  v.\nEdwards, 770 F.2d 739, 741 (8th Cir. 1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 6145.\n615  (9th  Cir.  1984); Hill  v.  Bogans, 735  F.2d  391,  393-94  (10th  Cir.  1984);\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 7 of 13(cid:10)\n- 7 -\nWilson  v.  Jones, 251  F.3d  1340,  1342-43  (11th  Cir.  2001).  These  principles\nrequire the invalidation in this case of the Sheriffโs policies.\nA.  Routine Strip Searches of Persons Arrested on Warrants Issued\nin Traf๏ฌc, Ordinance Violation, and Misdemeanor Cases is\nUnconstitutional\nThe  Sheriff  acknowledges  in  his  written  policy  that  persons  arrested  in\ntraf๏ฌc, ordinance violation, and misdemeanor cases that involve neither weapons\nnor drugs should not be routinely strip searched.3 There is no rational basis for\napplying a different rule to persons arrested on a failure to appear warrant issued\nin a traf๏ฌc, ordinance or misdemeanor case.\nIllinois  law  authorizes  issuance  of  a \"failure  to  appear\" warrant,  also\nknown  as  a \"bench warrant,\" when  an  accused  has  failed  to  appear  in  court.\n725  ILCS  110-3.  Although \"a  bench  warrant  does  not  amount  to  a  judicial\n๏ฌnding of probable cause to arrest in the traditional sense, i.e., that a crime had\nbeen committed and that defendant had committed it,\" (citation omitted) People\nv. Allibalogun, 312  Ill.App.3d  515,  518, 727 N.E.2d 633, 636 (2000), such a\nwarrant authorizes the Sheriff to \"book\" a person arrested (or surrendering) on a\nbench warrant. Doe v. Sheriff of DuPage County, 128 F.3d 586, 588 (7th Cir.\n1997).  A \"bench warrant,\" however,  does  not  authorize  the  Sheriff  to  incar-\ncerate the arrestee, but instead requires the Sheriff to bring the arrestee before\n__ _____________\n3. Section  L  of  Policy  5080  states  that \"[n]o  person  arrested  for  a  traf๏ฌc,\nordinance/regulatory or misdemeanor offense, except in cases involving weapons or\na  controlled  substance  arrest,  shall  be  strip  searched.\" (Plaintiffsโ  Rule  56.1\nStatement, par. 11.)\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 8 of 13(cid:10)\n- 8 -\n\"the nearest and most accessible judge.\" 725 ILCS 5/109-1.\nThe  Sheriff  appears  to  concede  that  there  is  no  rational  basis  for  a\npresumption that persons arrested on a failure to appear warrant in traf๏ฌc, ordi-\nnance violation, or misdemeanor cases are likely to have secreted contraband on\ntheir body. \"[A]rrestees do not ordinarily have notice that they are about to be\narrested and thus an opportunity to hide something.\" Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d\n56, 64 (2d Cir. 2001).\nRather  than  seeking  to  defend  this  irrational  presumption,  the  Sheriff\nargues that it is lawful to strip search persons arrested on failure to appear war-\nrants in misdemeanor, ordinance violation, and traf๏ฌc cases because such per-\nsons \"are legally in custody under [13] the authority of a judge as opposed to an\narrest without warrant just by a police of๏ฌcer.\" (Fink  Dep.  12-13,  Plaintiffsโ\nExhibit 2.)  This argument is a lengthy non-sequitur:  Issuance of a bench war-\nrant  does  not  constitute  a  ๏ฌnding  that  there  is  a  reasonable  basis  for  a  strip\nsearch; the only judicial ๏ฌnding underlying a bench warrant is that a criminal\ndefendant failed to comply with a condition of pre-trial release, such as appear-\ning in court.\nEqually without merit is the Sheriffโs argument that Illinois law authorizes\nthe strip search of persons arrested on bench warrants.  (Defendantsโ Response\nto Plaintiffsโ Motion to Stay Discovery from Individual Class Members, Record\nItem No. 44, at 6.)  The statute on which defendants rely, 725 ILCS 5/103-1(j),\nprovides that the state law prohibition of strip searching persons arrested for a\ntraf๏ฌc, regulatory, or misdemeanor cases (other than in cases involving weapons\nor a controlled substance) \"shall not apply when the person is taken into custody\nby  or  remanded  to  the  sheriff  or  correctional  institution  pursuant  to  a  court\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 9 of 13(cid:10)\n- 9 -\norder.\" If this case was governed by Illinois law, plaintiffs would argue that\n725 ILCS 5/103-1(j) does not apply to a person arrested on a bench warrant,\nwho is in the custody of the sheriff only until he (or she) can be brought before\n\"the nearest and most accessible judge.\" 725 ILCS 5/109-1. Illinois law, how-\never, is not controlling on the Fourth Amendment claims at issue in this case:\n\"A discriminatory state law is not a defense to liability under federal law; it is a\nsource of liability under federal law.\" Quinones v. City of Evanston, 58 F.3d\n275, 277 (7th Cir. 1995).\nThe irrationality of the Sheriffโs presumption that persons arrested on war-\nrants is re๏ฌected in the policy of the DuPage County Jail.  General Order COR\n6-9.8  of  the  DuPage  County  Jail,  (Plaintiffโs  Exhibit  3)  governs  searches  of\ninmates.  (Plaintiffsโ Rule 56.1 Statement, par. 14.)  Section III (C)(1)(a) of this\nrule authorizes a strip search when the inmate has been arrested on a new charge\ninvolving drugs or weapons, as long as \"there is reasonable belief established\nthat  the  inmate  has additional  drugs  or  paraphernalia  on  his/her  person,\nwhich is not detectable in a complete, accurate, and thorough pat search.\"\n(emphasis  in  original)  (Plaintiffsโ  Rule  56.1  Statement,  par.  15.)  The  rule\nexpressly  states,  however,  that  an  arrest  on  a  new  charge  does  not  include\narrests on a \"failure to appear warrant.\" Id.\nThe  Fourth  Amendment  prohibits  the  routine  strip  search  of  persons\narrested on traf๏ฌc, ordinance violation and misdemeanor charges (which do not\ninvolve weapons or drugs).  This rule applies with equal force when a person is\nin custody on a failure to appear warrant issued in a traf๏ฌc, ordinance violation\nand misdemeanor case. Accordingly, summary judgment on liability should be\nentered in favor of Subclass One and against the Sheriff of Will County.\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 10 of 13(cid:10)\n- 10 -\nB.  The Routine Strip Searches of Persons Returning from Court\nWho Are Awaiting Release from Custody Is Unreasonable\nThe  Sheriff  has  to  date  failed  to  offer  any  defense  of  his  practice  of\nrequiring  the  strip  search  of  persons  returning  from  court  who  are  awaiting\nrelease from the jail.  We note that a similar practice resulted in a sizable dam-\nage award in Young v. City of Little Rock, 249 F.3d 730, 735-36 (8th Cir. 2001).\nIn Bell v. Wol๏ฌsh, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Court considered a challenge\nto a Bureau of Prisons rule that required the strip search of every inmate return-\ning from a \"contact visit with a person from outside the institution.\" Id. at 558.\nThe Court concluded that the rule was related to stopping the \"[s]muggling of\nmoney, drugs, weapons, and other contraband\" into the institution, id. at 559,\nand  upheld  the  rule  by \"[b]alancing  the  signi๏ฌcant  and  legitimate  security\ninterests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates.\" Id. at\n560.  The Sheriffโs rule of strip searching persons who are to be released from\nthe jail ๏ฌunks this balancing test.\nThe Sheriffโs policy of \"strip search before release\" has no relationship to\ninstitutional  safety,  as  the  district  court  recognized  in Gary  v.  Sheahan, 1998\nWL 547116 (No. 96 C 7294, N.D.Ill. August 20, 1998).  There, the court invali-\ndated the routine strip search of detainees at the Cook County jail after they had\nbeen ordered released from custody by a judge on the following reasoning:\n[T]he question currently under review is whether the searches con-\nducted  on  female  detainees  after  they  had  been  ordered  released\nfrom custody by a judge is unreasonable under the circumstances.\nIn order to determine reasonableness, the court must balance the\nprisonโs need for security with the privacy interests of the plain-\ntiffs.  A court in this district has explained the balancing test as\nfollows:\n[I]f  jail  security  is  to  justify  the  search  the  detainee  must\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 11 of 13(cid:10)\n- 11 -\npresent  some  threat  to  jail  security.  The  facts  in  the  cases\nwhere  searches  have  been  upheld  suggest  some  reasonable\ncause  on  the  part  of  the  authorities  to  suspect  that  the\ndetainees might be trying to smuggle weapons or contraband\ninto  the  jail.  A  person  detained  for  a  violent  crime  may\npresumptively be suspected of carrying a weapon.  However,\nwhen an arrestee is being detained brie๏ฌy awaiting the posting\nof  bond  on  a  traf๏ฌc  or  misdemeanor  offense,  generally  a\nstrip-search can be made only on reasonable suspicion that the\narrestee  is  carrying  or  concealing  a  weapon  or  contraband,\nunless  authorities  can  demonstrate  that  misdemeanants  regu-\nlarly pose a threat to jail security.\nSimenc v. Sheriff of DuPage County, No.  82  C  4778,  1985\nWL  4896,  at  *  3  (N.D.Ill.  December  9,  1985)  (Moran,  J.)\n(citations omitted).\nPursuant  to  this  test,  variety  of  courts  have  found  that  strip\nsearches in the prison context may be unconstitutional.  For exam-\nple,  in Doe  v.  Calumet  City, 754  F.Supp.  1211,  1218  (N.D.Ill.\n1990) (Shadur, J.), the court found that the Constitution prohibits\nblanket  strip  search  policies  that  do  not  distinguish  between\narrestees.  Similarly,  in Tinetti  v.  Wittke, 479  F.Supp.  486,  491\n(E.D.Wis. 1979), affโd, 620 F.2d at 160 (7th Cir. 1980), the court\nconcluded  that  strip  searches  of  detainees  for  nonmisdemeanor\ntraf๏ฌc  violations  are  unconstitutional  absent  probable  cause  to\nbelieve  the  offender  is  concealing  contraband  or  weapons.  This\ncourtโs  analysis  of  the  case  law  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  the\ndefendant mustโat the leastโhave a reasonable suspicion that the\nplaintiff class member is carrying or concealing a weapon or con-\ntraband.  The plaintiffs, as women for whom there is no longer any\nbasis  for  their  detention,  clearly  have  a  privacy  interest  in  their\nbody  parts  which  is  as  great,  if  not greater, than that of pretrial\ndetainees. See  Tinetti,  Mary  Beth  G.,  supra. As  such,  the\ndefendantโs  blanket  policy  of  strip  searching  all  court  returnsโ\nincluding those  who  may  proceed  for  releaseโis  constitutionally\nsuspect. See Doe, supra.\nGary v. Sheahan, 1999 WL 281347, *12-*13 (No. 96 C 7294, N.D.Ill.\nMarch 31, 1999)\nThe district courtโs reasoning in Gary v. Sheahan, supra, is fully applica-\nble to this case.  Accordingly, summary judgment on liability should be entered\n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 48     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 12 of 13(cid:10)\n- 12 -\nin favor of Subclass Two and against the Sheriff of Will County.\nIV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons above stated, the Court should grant summary judgment\non liability in favor of each subclass and against the Sheriff of Will County.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Kenneth N.

The jurisi:l1.t:ti0lf of \nthis Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.c. ยง1343.  ~ 2; \n2.  Plaintiff Javar Calvin is a resident of the Northern District of Illi10iS. \n3.  Defendant Sheriff of Will County is sued in his official capacity. \n4.  In October of 2002, plaintiff was enlarged on bond in a misdemeanor case \npending in the state court in Joliet, Illinois. \n5.  On October 19, 2002, a police officer of the City of Bolingbrook, Illinois \narrested  plaintiff  because  records  maintained  by  defendant  mistakenly \nindicated that a warrant had been issued for plaintiff's arrest. \n6.  Plaintiff was brought to the Will County Jail on October 20, 2002 at about \n4:00 a.m.  While at the jail, plaintiff repeatedly insisted that he had been \narrested  by  mistake  and  that  he  was  not  sought  in  any  outstanding \nwarrant.  Plaintiff's protestations were ignored by jail personnel. \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 1     Filed 05/08/2003     Page 2 of 5(cid:10)\n- 2 -\n7.  Plaintiff was scheduled to appear before a judge in the morning of Mon \nday,  October 21,  2002.  Plaintiff determined that he was  not among the \nprisoners who were being taken to  court and complained to jail officials. \nThe jail officials responded to plaintiff's complaint by placing him in dis \nciplinary segregation. \n8.  Shortly after 9:00 a.m. on October 21, 2002, a judge reviewed plaintiff's \nbail status,  concluded that plaintiff was being held in error,  and ordered \nplaintiff's release.  Jail personnel ignored this order until  1:00 p.m., when \nthey  took plaintiff from  disciplinary segregation and brought him before \nthe judge.  The judge reaffirmed his order that plaintiff should be released. \n9.  Jail personnel again ignored the judge's order and returned plaintiff to dis \nciplinary segregation at the jail, where he remained until he was released \nat about 7:30 p.m. that night. \n10.  The  above  described  detention caused plaintiff to  be  deprived  of rights \nsecured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of \nthe United States and was  the direct and proximate result of the official \npolicies of the Sheriff of Will County. \n11.  As the direct and proximate result of the above described unlawful deten \ntion, plaintiff incurred personal injuries and lost wages. \n12.  Plaintiff hereby demands trial to a jury. \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 1     Filed 05/08/2003     Page 3 of 5(cid:10)\n- 3 -\nWHEREFORE, plaintiff prays that judgment be entered in his  favor  and \nagainst  defendant in  an  amount  in  excess  of twenty  five  thousand  dollars  as \ncompensatory  damages  and that the  costs  of this  action,  including reasonable \n,lImn,y,' 1m, be \"\",00 ,g';\", d\"~dmL ~ \nKENNETH N.

This court previously certified two subclasses in the inMant aclion_ \nSubclass f', the \"Post-Arrest Strip Search\" subclass, is defined as: \nAny person who, from May 8, 2001, to the date of entry of judgment has been, is, or will \nhe: \nArrested on a warrant issued for failure to appear in a misdemeanor \nor traffic case and, following arrival at the Will County Adult \nDetention Facility, is or was strip searched without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause \nthat he or she was concealing contraband or weapons.  Calvin, \n* \n2004 WL 1125922, at  4_ \nSubclass II, the \"Post-Release Strip Search\" subclass, is defined as: \nAny person who, from May 8, 2001, to the date of entry of judgment has heen, is, or will \nbe: \nIn the custody of the Sheriff of Will County on a traffic or \nmisdcmeanor charge (or On a warrant issued for failure to appear \non a traffic or n1isdemeanor charge), taken to court from the Will \nCounty Adult Detention Facility, ordered released by the court, or \n'Unless otherwise noted, thc following facts, taken from the parties' L.R. 56.1 statements \nand attached exhihits, arc not in dispute.  The court notes that both parties expend unnecessary \nenergy attacking each other's L.R. 56.1 statements.  The court agrees that several oCplaintiffs' \nstatements of fact contain legal conclusions.  For example, paragraph 13 concludes that a \"bench \nwarrant\" is equivalcnt to a \"failure to appear warrant\" described in 725 ILCS 110/3.  The court \nalso agrees, however, that several or derendant's responses to plainti ffs' statements of fact state \nare improper.  For example, many of defendant's responses state, \"Admitted in part and denied in \npart,\" but do not deny the statement.  Instead, defendant attempts to insert additional, non \nresponsive facts or legal argument in its response.  The court need not resolve the issue, however, \nbecause, as discussed bclow, there is no dispute ahout any material issue offac!. \n'The  notes that the subclasses have been renumbered to reneet that the court denied \nCOUIt \ncertification of subclass I. \n2 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 3 of 26(cid:10)\notherwise became entitled to immediate release, was returned to \nthe Will County Adult Detention Facility to be processed out oflhe \ncustody of the Sheri rr of Will County, and was strip searched \nwithout any individualized finding ofreasonab\\c suspicion that he \nor she was concealing contraband or weapons.  Id. at *6. \nPolicy No. 5080 of the WCADF Policy and Procedures (\"Policy 5080\") contains search \npolicies for the WCADF, including policies for visual body cavity searches and strip searches. \nPolicy 5080 states that a visual hody cavity search is \"the visual inspection ofthe anal or vaginal \narea,\" and must he \"conducted by trained staffin private.\" Policy 5080 limits visual cavity \nsearches to instances when there is \"a reasonahle hc1iefthat the inmate is carrying contraband or \nother prohibited materia\\.\"  Under Policy 5080, a strip search \"requires the removal or \narrangement of any clothing so that the entire hody or party of the body may be viewed.\"  Strip \nsearches may not be performed on persons arrested lor traffic, ordinance/regulatory or \nmisdemeanor offenses, except in cases involving weapons or a controlled substance arrest.  A \nstrip search may be perfo[lJ1ed \"ifthere is reasonable belieftbatthe individual is concealing a \nweapon or concealed substance.\" Policy 5080 also provides two instances when a strip search \nmay be conducted absent reasonable suspicion: (1) when an arrestee i~ \"remanded to the custody \nof the Sheriff on any warrant\"; and (2) after \"transports outside [the facility].'\"  Plaintiffs in the \ninstant action challenge these two exceptions. \n'Paragraph J of Policy 5080 states, \n\"Strip searches may be performed on all inmates, [sic] remanded to the custody of the \nSheriff on any warrant or mittimus for failure to post bond, or any subject arrested \nwithout warrant that will be housed in the WCADF.

(i.e. contact visits, transports outside or upon returning from any furlough \nor temporary release.[)]\" \n3 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 4 of 26(cid:10)\nSergeant Brain Fink (\"Fink\"), director of training and accreditation for the WCADF, \nwrote the original draft of Policy 5080 in 1989.  Fink testified that during a strip search an inmate \nis first required to remove all of his clothing and shake it out or hand it to the guards to search the \npockets.  The inmate is instmcted to show his hands, lift his arms, run his hands behind his ears, \nand lean forward and shake his hair.  The inmate in then asked to show his hands again, tum \naround and show the bottom of his feet, and hend over and spread the cheeks of his buttocks with \nhis hands.  Next, the inmate is told to stand up, face the officer, and lift his genitals.  Finally, the \ninmate shows his hands again and is allowed to redress.4  All stip searches  at the WCADF arc \nconducted in private areas and by an officer of the same gender as the person being searched. \nSuhclass 1 challenges post-arrest strip searches.  All persons alTested pursuant to a \nwarrant, including a failure to appear (\"FTA\") warrant, are stripped searched if they are lL11willing \nor unahle to post bail.  After being strip searched, these individuals arc housed in the \"E\"pod (\"E-\npod\") at the WCADF, which is a direct observation section of the facility consisting of 120 cells. \nIndividuals who arc not strip searched whcn they arrive at the WCADF, including those arrested \non  misdemeanor or traffic offenses not based on warrants, are held in the booking area. \nDefendant asserts that the need to hold arrestees in hooking area has resulted in an overcrowding \n4The court notes that deCendant denies plainti rcs' L.R. 56.1 statement that the strip scarch \nconducted at the WCADF is defined as a \"visual cavity search\" because Policy 5080 defines \nthem separately_  Fink, however, who was produced by defendants pursuant to Fed_ R. Civ. P. \n30(b)(6) to answer questions about the policies regarding strip searches applied at the WCADF , \ntestified at his deposition that a strip search as conducted at the WCADF includes \"what is \nreferred to in Policy 5080 as a visual cavity search,\" and that there is no difference between the \ntwo searches.  Defendant's effort to create a disputed issue of fact on this question is \nunpersuasl ve. \n4 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 5 of 26(cid:10)\nproblem in the hooking area, an area that was not intended to house inmates, and that even \ninmates in the E-pod are usually placed in a cell with another inmate due to overcrowding. \nSubclass II challenges post-release strip searches performed on detainees who are ordered \nreleased by a judge and then returned to the WCADF to be processed and to retrieve their \nhelongings.  Inmates who arc taken out ofthe WCADF to court are not supervised hy Will \nCounty personnel the entire time that they are at the courthouse.  While at the courthouse they (Ire \nplaced in a housing unit cell with other inmates and have contact with people other than Will \nCounty Sheri ITs.  In particular, inmates may have contact with their relatives and their lawyers. \nFink lesti fled that all persons returned from court to the WCADF arc strip searched, even \nthose who have heen ordered released by a judge.  According to Fink, persons ordered released \nmust be searched because they are \"going back in the inmate population and having contact with \niImmtes\" while they arc being processed before being released and in order to collect their \npersonal possessions.  Processing includes checking whether the individual has any outstanding \ncases, and whether there are any warrants or \"holds\" Irom other jurisdictions.  Fink also testified \nthat there is a reasonable belief that every inmate who returns from court is canying contraband \nor other prohihited material.  Defendant changed its post-release procedures since the filing of \nthe instant action.  David Van Dyke (\"Van Dyke\"), deputy chiefsherifffor the County of Will, \nsubmitted an affidavit attesting that subsequent to September 15,2004, persons retuming from \ncourt after heing ordered released are not strip searched as a matter of course.  Instead, \"they are \ngiven the option of remaining in a holding area and having facility personnel retrieve their \npersonal belongings from their cell, or they are allowed to return to tbeir cell to obtain their \nbelongings themselves, but after consent, they are strip searched before entering the cell area\" \n5 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 6 of 26(cid:10)\nSUMMARY .JUDGMENT STANDARD \nA movant is entitled to summary judgment under Rule 56 when the moving papers and \naffidavits show there is no genuine issue ormateriallact and the movant is entitled to judgment \nas a mattcr oflaw.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Com. v. Catrell, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); \nUnterreiner v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 8 F.3d 1206, 1209 (7'h CiL 1993).  Once a moving \nparty has met its burden, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and set fOrtl1 \nspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Becker v. \nTenenbaum-Hill Associates. Inc., 914 F.2d 107, 110 (7,h Cir. 1990).  The court considers the \nrecord as a whole and draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party \nopposing the motion.  See Fisher v. Transco Services-Milwaukee, Inc., 979 F.2d 1239, 1242 (7,h \nCir. 1992). \nA genuine issue or material fact exists when \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury \ncould return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobhy, Inc, 477 U.S. 242, \n248 (1986); Stewart v. McGinnis, 5 F .3d 1031, 1033 (7'\" Cir. 1993).  However, the nomnoving \nparty \"must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material \nfacts.\"  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co .. Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).  \"The \nmere existence ofa scintilla of evidence in support of the [nonmoving party's] position will be \ninsufficient;  there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [nonmoving \nparty].\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. \nDISCUSSION \nIn the instant case, despite each party's atlempt to create them by inserting legal \nconclusions and argument into their L.R. 56.1 statements, there are no material lacts in dispute. \n6 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 7 of 26(cid:10)\nIndeed, there are very few facts at issue.  Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on (he issue of \nliability is hascd almost entirely on two pieces of evidence: (1) Policy 5080; and (2) Fink's \ndeposition testimony regarding the policies and practices concerning strip searches at (he \nWCADF.  It is clearly established that Policy 5080 required the searching of members of \nr \nsubclasses  and II, and that these policies wcrc cffectuated by defendant's personnel.  Defcndant \nconcedes that it had no reasonable suspicion that allY of the class members had contrab,md or \nweapons.  The question then is whether the strip search policies violated (he class memhers' \nFourth Amendment rights. \n1.  Subclass 1- Post-arrest search \nIn their subclass I claim, plaintiffs challenge defendant's policy of strip searching every \nperson arrested on an FTA   warrant for a misdemeanor or (rantc violation who does not post \nbond.  Plaintiffs argue that this policy violates the Fourth Amendment because it does not require \nan individual determination that there is a reasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee is \nconcealing weapons or other contraband, ,md that defendant's proffered justifications are not \nsufficient to justify a strip search that includes a visual body cavity inspection. \nPlainti ffs argue that an FT A warrant docs not carry with it the same probable cause \nfinding as an arrest warrant issued f(Jr an underlying charge, and (ha( it is not reasonable to \nassume that a person arrested on an FTA warrant in a traffic or misdemeanor case \"will have \nsought to hide contraband in a spot where it can only be discovered by a strip search.\"  According \nto plaintiffs, this presumption is particularly inappropriate for individuals issucd FTA warrants in \nmisdemeanor or (ramc cases.  Defendant responds that an FTA warrant is equivalent (0 any \nwarrant and thus justifies the strip searches of all warrant arrcstccs.  Defendant also argues (ha( \n7 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 8 of 26(cid:10)\nevery warrant requires it to detain arrestees who cannot post bond, and that arrestees are detained \nin the E~pod with the general jail population.  The strip searches, assert defendant, are thus \njustified by the jail's legitimate security concerns.  For the reasons discusscd below, thc court \ngrants plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to subclass I. \nThe Supreme Court's opinion in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), is the seminal \ndetainee strip search case.  Balancing \"the signilicant and legitimate security interests of the \ninstitution against the privacy interests of the inmates,\" the Bell court upheld a prison policy \nrequiring inmates to submit to routine strip searches with visual cavity inspections after evelY \ncontact with a person from outside the institution.  Td. at 560.  Despite holding that particular \npolicy constitlltional, Bell did not validate a blanket policy of strip searching pretrial detainees. \nWilson v. Jones, 251  F.3d 1340, 1342 (ll  Cif. 2001) (citing Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, \nIh \n1253 (6'h Cir. 1989)); see also Tikalskv v. City of Chicago, 687 F.2d 175, 182 (7'h Cir. 1982) \n(Bell \"did not validate strip searches per se\").  Rather, Bell held that pretrial detainees retain \nconstitutional rights, including the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable \nsearches and scizures, which are subject to limitations based on the fact of confinement and the \ninstitution's need to maintain security and order.  Id. at 545-46.  Tn balancing the constitutional \nrights of the inmate with the interests ofthc pcnal institution, a court must consider four factors: \n(1) the scope of the particular intrusion; (2) the manner in which it is conducted; (3) the place in \nwhich it is conducted; and (4) the justification for initiating it.  Td. at 559. \nIn the instant case, ncither the place nor manner of the searches is problematic. \nThankfully, the undisputed policy and practice ofthe strip searches at issue here do not illvolve \nthe parade ofterribles and abuses presented by other strip search cascs.  Sce. c.I;., Doc v. Calumet \n8 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 9 of 26(cid:10)\nCity, 754 F. StiPp. 1211, 1214-15 (N.D.JJl. 1990) (female arrestees subjected to \"offensive \ntouching,\" digital cavity searches, visual observation by male officers while being strip searched, \nand fondling by male officers while in plain sight ofmalc officers and others).  Plaintiffs do not \ndispute that the WCADF searches were conducted in private by officers of the same gender, and \nwith \"tact.\" In addition, the WCADF personnel did not touch the detainees and there have heen \nno accusations of abuse. \nPlaintiffs argue that the scope of searches - which require inmates to strip naked and \npermit a visual cavity inspection -was not justified.  Courts have repeatedly held that strip \nsearches that include visual inspection orthe anal and genital areas are inherently invasive.  The \nSupreme Court stated in Bell that a strip search and visual inspection of inmates' body cavities \n\"instinctively gives us the most pause.\"  441 U.S. at 558-59.  In Marv Beth G. v. City of Chicago, \n723 F.2d 1263,1272 (7,h Cir. 1983), the Seventh Circuit described strip searches as \"demeaning, \ndehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, \nsignifying degradation and suhmission.\" See also, Swain v. Spilmey, 117 F.3d 1,7 (l\" Cir. 1997) \n(visual cavity searches \"impinge seriously\" upon Fourth Amendment values); Chapman v. \nNichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395 (lO,h eir. 1993) (\"There can be no doubt that a strip search is an \ninvasion of privacy of the first magnitude.\"); Thompson v. County of Cook, 2005 WL 1950363, \nat *7 (N.D.l11. Aug. 8,2005) (\"It is beyond argument that the search involved [a strip search \nincluding visual cavity inspection] is extremely intrusive.\"). \nDefendant must establish a sufficient \"justification for initiating\" such an invasive search. \n13ell, 441 U.S. at 559.  Defendant argues that the blanket strip search policy for warrant arrcstccs \nis necessary to ensure safety at the WCADF because warrant arrestces who do not post bond \n9 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 10 of 26(cid:10)\nmust be detained in the E-pod with the general jail population.  Courts. beginning with Bell, have \nconsistently held tllat institutional security is a legitimate law enforcement objective, and may \nprovide a compelling reason for a strip search absent reasonable suspicion of individualized \nwrongdoing.  See, e.g., Overton v. Bazzelta, 539 U.S. 126, 133 (2003) (maintaining institutional \nsecurity is \"perhaps the most legitimate of penological goals\").  Courts have given prisons \nlatitude to premise searches on the type of crime for which an imnate is arrested.  See, e.g., \nDufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1087 (6'0 Cir. 1983).  When the inmate has been charged with \nonly a misdemeanor or traffic violation, crimes not generally associated with weapons or \ncontraband, however, eourts have required that officers have a reasonable suspicion that the \nindividual imnate is concealing contrahand. \nTn Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7'h Cir. 1980), the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district \ncourt's holding, 479 F. Supp. 486 (E.D. Wis. 1979), that a blanket policy of strip searching \npeople charged with a non-misdemeanor traffic violation \"without probable cause to believe that \nshe was concealing weapons or contraband on her hody was a violation of the plaintiffs rights \nunder the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments ofthe U.S. Constitution.\" 479 F. Supp. at \n491.  The plaintiffs in Tinetti challenged a policy of the Racine County jail that required the strip \nsearch ofpersons arrested for non-misdemeanor traffic offenses \"due to an unwillingness or \ninahility to post bond before their initial appearance in couri.\"  620 F.2d at 160.  The Seventh \nCircuit adopted the district court's holding that, \"[t]he intrusion on one's personal dignity \noccasioned by such searches requires that some justifiable basis exists.\" 479 F. Supp. at 491. \nAlthough Tinetti involved a search of people arrested for non-misdemeanor tranic violations \nonly, its reasoning clearly applies to all blanket search policies, such as the one at issue here, that \n10 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 11 of 26(cid:10)\nmake no distinctions among the Iypes of' crimes charged and that fail 10 require any level ofhelieC \nthat a particular arrestee is in possession of a weapon or contraband.  Doc v. Calumet, 754 F. \nSupp. atI219n.IS. \nIn Mary Beth G, which applied the reasoning of Tinetti, the Seventh Circuit held that \nChicago's policy of sUhjecting women, but not men, who had been arrested and detained on \nmisdemeanor charges, to a strip search regardless of the charges against them or whether \ndetention officers had any reasonable suspicion (hat a particular woman was concealing weapons \nor contraband, violated the Fourth Amendment.  723 F.2d a( 1273.  The Marv Beth G. court \nnoted, \"The more intrusive the search, the closer the government authorities must come forward \nto demonstrating probable cause for believing (hat the search will uncover the objects for which \n(he search is being conducled.\"  Id. at 1273 (quoting Terrv v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 18 n. 15 (1968ยป. \nOther courts of appeals have also held strip searches of misdemeanor arrestees \nunconstitutional.  Sec. c.g., Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64-66 (2\"d Cir. 2001) (policy of strip \nsearching misdemeanor arrestces unconstitutional); Logan v. Shealy. 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th \nCir. 1981) (strip search unconstitu(ional hecanse the officer had \"no cause\" to believe IhalDUT \ndetainee had a weapon or contraband); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984) (per \ncurium) (\"arrestees charged with minor offenses may he suhjectcd to a strip search only if jail \nonicials have a reasonable suspicion that thc individual arrestee is carrying or concealing \ncontraband\"); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391,394 (1 O'h Cir. 1984) (strip search of a traffic offender \nwith \"no circumstances here indicating [arrestee] might possess eilher a weapon or drugs\" was \nunconstitutional); Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1342 (11th Cir. 2001) (strip search policy that \ndid not require reasonable suspicion violated Fourth Amendment). \nII \n\nr----------------------------------------------.-.----\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 12 of 26(cid:10)\nA.  FfA warrant \nDefendant does not respond to any ofthe court of appeals cases cited by plaintiffs except \nMary Beth G., which it attempts to distinguish based on the plaintiffs ability to post bond, as \ndiscussed below.  Instead, defendant argues that its search policy is dislingLlishable because it \napplies to detainees arrested pursuant to a warrant, which defendant asserts negates the need for \nindividualized reasonable suspicion.  In support of this argument, defendant cites 725 TLCS \n5/l03-1(c), which provides that persons arrested tor a traffic, regulatory, or misdemeanor \noffense, except in cases involving weapons or a controlled substance, may not be strip searched. \nThe statute also provides, however, that this restriction \"shall not apply when the person is taken \ninto custody or remanded to the sheriff or correctional institution pursuant to court order.\"  725 \nILCS 5/103-1 (j).  TlIinois state appellate courts have held that because FTA warrants in \nmisdemeanor or traffic cases are \"pursuant to court order,\" and the statutory restriction against \nstrip searches docs not apply to persons arrested on such warrants.  People v. Mitchell, 353 111. \nApp. 3d 838, 840-841 (2nd Dis!. 2004); People v. Johnson, 334 TIl. ApI'. 3d 666, 672-3 (4'h Dist. \n2002).  lllinois courts have also held that strip searches of people arrested pursuant to FTA \nmisdemeanor warrants do not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Mitchell, 353 III. App. 3d at 843; \nJohnson, 334 Ill. App. 3d at 673. \nA federal district court is, of course, not bound by a state court's rulings on matters of \nfCderallaw, including whether a state statute or county policy violates the Fourth Amendment. \nSec. e.g., Quinones v. City of Evanston, 58 F.3d 275, 277 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"A discriminatory state \nlaw is not a defEmsc to liability under federal law; it is a source Mliability under f'ederallaw.\"). \nThe question then, is whether the issuance of an FTA warrant, often referred to as a \"bench \n12 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 13 of 26(cid:10)\nwarrant,\" satisfies the constitutional requirement of reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip \nsearch. \nPlaintiffs argue that although defendant is authorized to \"book\" a person who is arrested \nor surrenders pursuant (0 an FT A warrant, such a warranl is distinguishable from an arrest \nwarrant issued on a new charge.  Plaintiffs assert that an FT A warrant is issued upon a llnding \nthat a criminal defendant failed to comply with a condition of pretrial release, such as appearing \nin court, and thus cannot constitute a finding that there is a reasonable basis for a strip search. \nAn Illinois appellate court has notcd that \"a bench warrant does not amount to ajudieial finding \nof probable eausc to arrest in the (raditional sense, i.e., that a crime had been commiiled and that \ndefendant had committed it.\"  People v. Allibalogun, 312 Ill, App. 3d 515, 518 (2000) (citing \nUnited States v. Spencer, 684 f.2d 220, 223 (2\"d Cir. 1982ยป). \nThe courl agrees with plaintiffs that i( is difficult to reconcile prohibiting automatic slrip \nsearches of people arrested on traffic and misdemeanor charges --as the lllinois statute, case law, \nand Policy 5080 all do - with allowing the strip searches ofpeopJe arrested for a failure to appear \nregarding the identical charges.  Again, defendant fails to squarely addrcss plaintiffs' argument \nthat defendant lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct (he strip searchcs.  Instead, defendant \nargues that like all warrants, \"the FTA warrants aTe valid court orders that lawfully authorize the \nSheriffto arrest and detain someone, those warrants justified the searches in Ihis casc.\" \nDefendant fails, however, to provide any persuasive argument or case law in support of its leap \nof logic that the searches at issue here were constitutional because plaintiff5' detentions were \nlawful.  Defendant cites Doc v. Sheriff of DuPage County, 128 FJd 586, 588 (7th Cir. 1997) and \nCorbett v. White, 2001 WL 1098054, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Sep. 17. 2001).  Both ofthcse cases, \n13 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 14 of 26(cid:10)\nhowever, address ajail's authority to detain a warrant arrestee, and do not discuss searches of \ndetainees.  Doe v. Sheriff of DuPage County and Corbertt arc thus not responsive to the \ngravamen of plaintiffs' challenge, which is not directed at the constitulionality of their detention \nbut their trealment while detained. \nAccordingly, defendant has failed to create a triable issue of fact that arrest pursuant to an \nFT A warrant justifies the blanket strip search policy. \nB.  Opportunity to post bond \nDetendant also argues thallhe searches are authorized because they arc not conducted \nuntillhe arrestees arc given the opportunity to post bond.  According to defendant, this is in \ncontrast (olhe searches at issue in Marv Beth G., Tinetti, and Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 WL 547116 \n(N.D.TlI. Aug. ZO, 1998).  Defendant's argument (hat these cases arc distinguishable because the \n\"key\" in the courts' analysis \"is that the detention is fOf a brief period awaiting hound\" \nmisconstrues the facts and the holdings in thosc cases.  For example, the plaintiff in Tinetti was \ngiven an opportunity to post bond althe lime of her arrest for speeding.  479 F. Supp. at 488. \nShe was unahle to pay bond, and was taken into custody and strip searched.  Td.  She was \nreleased two hours later when her uncle posted bail.  Id.  Defendant asserts, without support in \nlhe Tinetti opinion, that the plaintiff in that case could have avoided the strip search if she had \nbeen penniHed to call her uncle earlier.  The Seventh Circuit affinned the district court's opinion \nthat the blanket policy of strip searching detainees who did not post bond was unconstitutional, \nand did not limit its holding to instances in which the detainee could or would have posted bond \nif given another opportunity or any opportunity at all.  Tinetti, 620 F.Zd at 160. \n14 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 15 of 26(cid:10)\nDefendant's attempt to distinguish Mary Beth G. and Gary. on the grounds that the \nplaintiffs in those cases were awaiting bond is similarly unconvincing hecause neither holding is \nbased on how long the arrestees were held or whether they wcre waiting for their bail to be paid. \nThe plaintiffs in Gary were strip searched after being released, and thus, as the Gary court made \nclear, the case did not concern people awaiting bail at al1.5 1998 WL 547116, at *12.  The \nSeventh Circuit describes the plaintiffs in Mary Beth G. as held \"in lockups\" while \"awaiting \narrival of bail money.\"  723 F.2d at 1266.  Defendant does not explain what would distinguish \nthe lockups in Maw Beth G. from the E-pod in which plaintiffs here were placed.  Moreover, \nthere is nothing in the record ofthc instant case to suggest that plaintiff.. were not expecting to he \nhailed out imminently. \nDefendan( fails to cite any case in which a court upheld a strip search pOlicy against a \nconstitutional challenge based on an opportunity to post hondo  To the contrary, other courts have \nrecognized that an arrestee's failure to post bond, which is often (he result of limited Ilnancial \nresources, cannot save a constitutionally infirm search.  For example, the Shain court held that \nneither (he inability nor the refusal (0 post hail \"creates a reasonable suspicion that the alleged \noffender has secreted contraband or a weapon.\"  273 F.3d a( 65.  Defendant's argument that the \nopportunity to post bond negates a Fourth Amendment challenge to the strip searches is not \nsupported hy the case law it cites, and is not persuasive. \n'The court notes that the language from Gary quoted by defendant is a quotation from \nSimenc V. Sheriff of DuPage County, 1985 WL4896 (N.D.IlI. Dec. 9, 1985), in which the \nplaintiffs did challenge their lack of opportunity to post bond. \n15 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 16 of 26(cid:10)\nC.  Institutional security \nThe most legally suhstantial justification offered by defendant in support of its strip \nsearch policy is institutional security, although dcfendant devotes scant attention to sec(Lrity in its \nbrief opposing summary judgment.  Maintaining institutional security as well as the safety ofj ail \nofficers and inmates has been recognized as a significant interest and valid justification for stlip \nsearches.  Stanley v. Hcnson, 337 F.3d 961,966 (7'h Cir. 2003).  The Supreme Court has \nobscrved that a \"detention facility is a unique plaee fraught with serious security dangers.\"  8ell, \n441 U.S. at 559.  The Seventh Circuit agreed in Mary Beth G., concluding that \"the need to \nassure jail security is a legitimate and suhstantial concern.\"  723 F.2d at 1273.  An institutional \npractice claimed to infringe a constitutional guarantee must be evaluated in light of the \ninstitution's essential intercst in seculity.  rd. at 546.  The Supreme Court has instructed courts to \nmake this evaluation de1erentially, giving due regard to the proiessional expertise of correctional \nofficials.  rd. at 548. \nAlthough the determinations of correctional officials regarding security procedures are \nentitled to deference, jail officials' decisions arc not immunized from scrutiny.  Stanley, F.3d at \n966.  As a court in this district noted recently, \"Officials do not have carle hlanche to institute \nallY policy they please under the justification of institutional security.\"  Thompson, 2005 WL \n1950363, at *7 (denying defendant's summary judgment motion arguing that visual cavity search \nof all dctainccs at jail did not violate FOUrtll Amendmcnt).  Several courts of appeals have made \nsimilar observations.  Sec. e.g., Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 113 (1\" Cir. 2001) (\"An \nindiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied ... [cannot] be justified simply on the basis of \nadministrative ease in attending to security considerations.\") (ellipsis in original; quoting Logan, \n16 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 17 of 26(cid:10)\n660 F.2d at 1013); Hill, 735 F.2d at 394-95 (Under Bell, \"jail's desire to maintain security, to \navoid charges of discriminatory treatment, and to promote administrati ve convenience simply \ndoes not justify routine strip searches in a public area ofpcrsons detained for minor traffic \noffenses.\"). \nIn the instant case, defcndant argues that the WCADF strip searches are required \n\"hecausc the inmate will he placcd in a portion of the facility with hundreds of other inmates in \nclose proximity, and it is necessary to protcct the safety nol only of guards and other irunates, but \nalso the safety of the person heing searched.\" That is, because the warrant arrestees are \n\"intenningled\" with the general jail population at the WCADF, the arrestees must submit to a \nstrip search. \nCourts have frequently noted that the intermingling of illlnates is a serious concern that \nweighs in favor of the reasonablencss, and constitutionality, of the search.  See Dufrin, 712 F.2d \nat 1087 (inmate would come into contact with general population); Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 \n(noting lack of intermingling).  Defendant cites to Roscom v. City of Chicago, 570 F. Supp. 259 \n(N.D. 111. 1983), in which the court upheld the strip search of an arrestee who was placed in jail \nafter being unable to post bond.  Several courts, including many courts of appeals, however, have \nsince held that intemlingling alone is insufficient to justify a search without reasonable suspicion. \nChapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 396 (10'\" Cir. 1993); Masters, 872 F.2d at 1254; sec also \nWilson v. Jones', 251 F.3d 1340, 1341-42 (ll'h Cir. 2001) (blanket policy of strip searching all \n'The courl notes that the Eleventh Circuit, sitting in bane to rehear an appeal of a case \nstriking down a strip search policy similar to that in Wilson, recently questioned its holding in \nWilson that arrestees detained in the general jail population can constitutionally be subject to a \nstrip search only if the search is supported hy reasonable suspicion.  Evans v. City or Zebulon, \n(continued ... ) \n17 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 18 of 26(cid:10)\narrestees placed in general population violated the Fourth Amendment).  The Ninth Circuit has \nstated that intermingling is a dubious reason for a strip search because it is inherently \"limited \nand avoidable,\"  Giles, 746 F,2d at 619, \nCourts have repeatedly invalidated strip searches of arrestees that were placed in the \ngeneral jail population based on the reasoning that less invasive searches or other detention \npractices cOlLid obviate the need for a strip search.  For example, in Roberts v, State ofR.I., the \nFirst Circuit struck down a policy requiring the strip search oj\" all arrcstccs held in the general \npopulation at an intake facility considered to be maximum security.  239 F.3d 107 (1\" CiT, 2001), \nThe Roberts COUTt held that the intermingling of arrestces with the general prison population, \nwhich was a product of the structure of Rhode Tsland prison system, \"is not, in itscJj~ dispositive \nofthe reasonableness of the search,\" The First Circuit found that to \"place so mlLch weight on \none (potentially alterable) characteristic of the state prison system would gut the balancing \napproach endorsed by the Supreme Court in Bell,\" Jd. at 113, \nTn the instant case, defendant fails to cite any authority in support of its presumption that, \ncontrary to the case law cited above, placing a detainee in the general jail population per sc \njnsti lies a strip search.  Instead, defendant states conclusorily that there is a \"reasonable belief' \nthat the person is carrying contraband whenever the person has heen arrested on a warrant, but \n\"( .. ,continued) \n407 F.3d 1272 (l11h Cir. 2005) (en bane).  The Evans panel stated, \"Most of  are uncertain that \ntiS \njailers are required to have reasonable suspicion of weapons or contraband before strip searching \nfor security and safety purposes - arrestees bound for the general jail population.\"  rd, at 1278, \nThe panel went on (0 observe the Supreme Court had never imposed such a \"reasonable \nsuspicion\" prerequisite on inmate strip searches, but stopped short of resolving the accuracy of \nthe panel's earlier statement.  For now, the law in the Eleventh Circuit remains as stated in \nWilson. \n18 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 19 of 26(cid:10)\ndoes not explain the basis of this presumption.  Courts invalidating searches of misdemeanor \narrestees have noted that arrestees are unlikely to have contraband hidden in their body orifices \nat the time of arrest.  See, e.g .. Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2\".1 Cir. 2001) (\"arrestcos do not \nordinarily have notice that they are about to be arrested and thus an opportunity to hide \n* \nsomething\"); Thompson, 2005 WL 1950363 at  8 (\"[I]t is a relatively sali:: assumption  at least \nin absence of evidence to the contrary - that only a negligible portion of anestees have concealed \ncontraband in body cavities prior to their encounter with law enforcement.\") (emphasis in \noriginal). \nThe Shain court distinguished its holding regarding misdemeanor arrestees from Bell's \nholding that it was reasonable to assume that prisoners might have hidden contraband after \ncontact visits, noting that \"[i]t is far less obvious that misdemeanor anestees frequently or evcn \noccasionally hide contraband in their bodily orifices.\"  Shain, 273 F.3d at 64.  Because of the \nnature of unanticipated arrests, blanket strip searcb policies are also unlikely to have the deterrent \neffect relied on in part by the Supreme Court in Bell.  As the Giles court noted, unlike visits to \nthe detention center in Bell, which are planned ami pennit visitors an opportunity to organize \ntheir smuggling activities, \"arrests and confinement...are unplanned events, so the policy could \nnot possibly deter arrestees from carrying contraband\"  Gi\\Cs, 746 F.2d at 617. \nThe logic of Shain and Gi\\Cs concerning unsuspecting arrcstcos is particularly applicable \nto subclass I which, pursuant to the class definition, does not include arrestees whom defendant \nhad reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe were concealing contraband or weapons. \nDefendant might have reasonable suspicion to search a person arrested on an FTA warranl in a \ncase involving contraband or weapons, or whose record otherwise indicated a reason to helicve \n19 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 20 of 26(cid:10)\nhe might be secreting items in his body cavities.  Such arrestees, however, are not included in \nsubclass I and plaintiffs do not challenge such searches.  Nothing in this opinion limits the \nWCADF's ability to conduct strip searches based on reasonable individualized suspicion, but \nsuch individualized justifications are the antithesis of the hlanket policy under attack. \nThe court docs not diminish or douht defendant's argument that all detainees must he \nsearched in order to ensure the safety of everyone at the WCADF.  Defendant does not argue, \nhowever, that people arrested on FTA warrants in misdemeanor or traffic cases arc likely to have \nsecreted contrahand that can be uncovered only by a strip search, as opposed to a Jess invasive \nsearch such as a pat down.  Defendant fa.ils to present any evidence that contraband is often, or \never, recovered from FT A warrant arrestees, and does not point to any particular security risk that \nwould he posed in the absence of strip searches. \nDefendant also fails to explain why all arrestees who arc detained at the WCADF must be \nheld with the general jail population.  Tfthere were a compelling reason to place FTA warrant \narrestees who do not post bond in the general jail population, the resulting intenningling of \ndetainees might provide a constitutionally sound reason for the strip search.  Instead of oflering \nsuch a reason, defendant repeatedly points to overcrowding in the booking area and asserts that \nstrip searches are required prior to intenningling with the general population jail in E-pod.  As \nthe cases discussed above make clear, administrative concerns such as \"space constraints\" arc not \nsufficient to justify blanket strip search policies.  See, e.g., Roherts, 239 F.3d at 113; Hill, 735 \nF.2d at 394-95.  Defendant fails to explain why a third option that would protect arrestees' \nFourth Amendment rights while furthering defendant's legitimate Jaw enforcement objectives, \nsuch as separate holding cells for certain arrestees, is not possible. \n20 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 21 of 26(cid:10)\nAhsent the proffer of any evidence to support its generalized claim of a security risk \nposed by members of subclass 1 or its claim that all detainees must he held with the general jail \npopulation, defendant has failed to create any triable issue of material fact that automatic post~ \narrest strip searches arc justified for all warrant arrestees.  See Thompson, 2005 WL 1950363, at \n*7 (defendant sheriff not entitled to summary judgment on reasonableness of strip search where it \n(ails to present evidence ofiten1s found on newly arriving detainees); see also, Roberts, 239 F.3d \nat 112 (indicating that searching all inmates is more reasonable in cases in which the rccord \nrefleclR a history of problems with prisoners smuggling items into the institution). \n\"Bell has not been read as holding that the security interests of a detention facility will \nalways outweigh the privacy interests of the detainees.\" Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County. 823 \nF.2d 955, 959 (6'0 Cir. 1987).  As the First Circuit has noted, \"the Fourth Amendment balance \ncannot be shifted so quickly\"  Roberts, 239 F.3d at 113.  In the instant case, defendant suggests \nthe placement of arrestecs among the general jail population as the sole basis for security \nconcerns.  Defendant docs not explain what other individuals are in the general population at the \nWCADF or what security risks they might pose, and defendant does not argue that individuals \narrested on FTA   warrants could be not held elsewhere.  As the Roberts court noted, a prison \nsystem cannot rely on the realities of its own detention structure alone to justify an invasion of \nprivacy as signi ficant as a strip search.  ld. \nBecause the court finds that defendant's blanket policy of searching all arrestees arrested \nOll FT A warrants for misdemeanor or traffic violations violates the Fourth Amendment, the court \ngrants plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment of liability as to suhclass L \n21 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 22 of 26(cid:10)\nn.  Subclass II - Post-release search \nIn their subclass n claim, plaintiffs challenge defendant's policy of strip searching \nindividuals returned to the WCADF from court after being ordered released.  Plaintiffs argue that \nthe automatic post-release searches are unconstitutional because they are not justified under Bell. \nDefendant argues that after released arrestees return from court, processing the paperwork for \nfinal release \"could take three to four to six hours,\" and that due to overcrowding iss\\les they \nmust be returned to the general jail population while they wait.  According to defendant, once a \nreturn to a cell is necessary, a strip scarch is required because the returnees were not under the \nconstant supervision of defendant while at court and they had contact with relatives and \nattorneys.  For the reasons discussed below, the court grants plaintiffs' motion for summary \njudgment as to subclass n. \nBegilllling with Bell, courts \"have given prisons far more leeway in conducting searches \nof inmates with outside contact then in searching everyone, simply because s\\lch visits often \nallow smuggling of contraband.\"  Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111; see also, Shain, 273 F.3d at 63 \n(\"Unlike persons already injail who receive contact visits, arrestees do not ordinarily have notice \nthat they are about to be arrested and thus an opportunity to hide something.\"); Masters, 872 F,2d \nat 1253 (6th Cir. 1989) (citing the \"obvious risk\" that visits may be used to introduce contraband); \nThompson, 2005 WL 1950363, at *8 (distinguishing intake detainees from individuals searched \nfollowing contact with outsiders). \nTn Bell, as discussed above, the Supreme Court upheld the policy of searching pretrial \ninmates after every contact visit.  441 U.S. at 560.  The Supreme Court noted, however, that \nsome ofthe pretrial detainees in that case were facing serious charges and that the defendant \n22 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 23 of 26(cid:10)\nproved that in at least one instance during the institution's short history contraband was found \nduring a body cavity search.  Id. at 558.  In the instant case, by contrast, plaintiffs were charged \nwith misdemeanor or traffic violations only.  The plaintiffs had been ordered released prior to \nbeing brought back to the WCADF and strip searched.  Plaintiffs, as individuals for whom there \nis no longer any basis for detention, clearly have a privacy interest in their body parts which is as \ngreat, if not greater, than that of pretrial detainees.  Sec Tinetti, Marv Beth G., supra.  Moreover, \nas with subclass 1, defendant presents no evidence that a post-release strip search has ever \ndiscovered any contraband. \nPlaintiffs argue that the instant case is analogous to Gary, which held that the defendant's \n\"blanket policy of strip searching all court returns - including those who may proceed for rele<lse \n- was constitutionally suspect.\"  1998 WL 547116, at *12-13.  Tn Gary, as in the instant case, \nthere was no longer any basis for the detention of the plaintiffs at the time they were searched, \nand the only reason they returned to the jail-and strip searched - was to collect their properly \nand to await processing.  Td. at *14.  The Gary court noted, \"A simple change in the processing of \nthe individuals in the plaintiff class would eliminate the problem.\"  Id. at *14.  Here, defendant \nadmits that subsequent to September 15, 2004, returnees were given the option ofremaining in \nthe holding area and having facility personnel retrieve their personal belongings from the cell, or \nbeing allowed to return to their cell after consenting to a strip search.7  The inmates who are not \nreturned to their cells remain in the booking area while their release paperwork is completed. \nDefendant has therefore followed the Gl!rv court's suggestion by instituting a simple change in \n7Although defendant does not contest the admissibility of the change, the court notes that \nsubsequent remedial measures are admissible to demonstrate feasibility.  Fed. R. Evid. 407; \nMiles v.Badge #148 Baker, 1992 WL 14301, at *3 n. 7 (N.D.IlI. Jan. 17,1992). \n23 \n\nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 24 of 26(cid:10)\nโข \nprocedure, and has failed to provide any evidence that the change has compromised security at \nthe WCA DF or created urm1aJ1ageabie administrative burdens. \nDefendant argues that Qm:y is factually distinguishable because the strip searches in that \ncase were performed only on women, and were conducted in puhlic areas.  Id. at *2.  It is true \nthat there were troubling aspects concerning the place and ma11l1er of the strip searches in Qm:y \nthat are not present in the instant casco  Neither factor, however, was decisive in the Gary \nholding.  Defendant abo argues that Qm:y can be distinguished because the defend,mt there \nattempted to justify the searches almost exclusively by claiming administrative inconvenience \nbecause it had to process six to eight inmates on a daily hasis.  Tn addition, the defendant in Gary \nconceded that it could have processed (he court retumees quickly, and that it was possible to \ndischarge the women from the receiving room if/hey agreed to waive collecting their personal \nbelongings from the cells and allowing thc helongings to be brought to them.  Id. at * 14.  The \nGary court recognized that Unsuperyised contact by inmates presents a security concem upon \nretum to the facility, but found this justification \"substantially diminished\" in that case because \nthe defendant searched female inmates only, even though male irunates had the same degree of \noutside contact.  Id. \nAlthough the court agrees with defendant that Qm:y is factually distinguishable in some \naspects, and that the holding in Qm:y \"docs not automatically invalidate the searches here,\" much \nof the Gary holding is analogous (0 the instant case and weighs in plaintiffs' favor.  In the instant \ncase, although defendant does not concede quite as much as the dclcndant in Gary, it also ia.ils to \noffer any evidence of a genuine security concern posed by post-rclease detainees.  Defendant \nasserts (hat i( receives twenty to thirty returnees at a time, that there was already an overcrowding \n24 \n\n__  __ \n... __ ...  .. _.  . -----------------------------, \nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 25 of 26(cid:10)\nproblem in the booking area which increased the time for processing the releases ofthese \nindividuals, and that this makes it Jess practicable for all of them to remain in the booking area. \nEssentially, defendant argues that it has no choice but to place the released returnees back in the \ngeneral j ail population.  This claim, however, is belied by its own change in procedure in \nSeptember 2004, which gives post-release detainees the option of remaining in the booking area. \nAs with its claims of security dangers pose by FTA warrant arrestees, defendant does not \nasscrt that the September 2004 change regarding released returnees ha~ caused any \nadministrative, security, or other problems, and fails 10 present any evidence to that clTect.  See, \n~,Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 887 (I\" Cir. 1983) (a policy of scarc hing all inmales is more \nreasonable when the record indicates a \"lengthy history of contraband problems.\").  Dclcndant \nagain attempts to use its own internal administrative procedures and practices to justi fy an \nalleged constitutional violation.  This argument in equally unpersuasive regarding subclass II for \nthe reasons discussed above regarding subclass T. \nAs discussed above, to survive constitutional scrutiny a blanket policy of performing strip \nsearches, which are inherently invasive, must be balanced by a justification such as a genuine \nneed to preserve institutional security.  In the instant case, defendant has failed to create a triable \nissue of facllhallhe slrip searches of post-release detainees are required to ensure the sarety 01' \ntile WCADF or that other procedures that impinged less on individuals' Fourth Amendment \nrights could nol be instituted.  Because tile court finds that defendant's blanket policy of \nsearching all post-release detainees who had becn arrcstcd on misdemeanor or traffic charges or \non FTA warrants in misdemeanor or lraffic charges violates the Fourth Amendment, the court \ngrants plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to liability for subclass II. \n25 \n\n- .. _- - --\"\"--\"---\"--'-'---------------------------------------------, \nCase 1:03-cv-03086     Document 62     Filed 12/16/2005     Page 26 of 26(cid:10)\nIII.
