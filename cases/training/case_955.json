    "summary": "<p>In December 1985, inmates and former inmates at the Morgan County Regional Correctional Facility in Tennessee filed three lawsuits against the Tennessee Department of Corrections and the Morgan County Regional Correctional Facility pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.   Male inmates and their wives or fiancés brought three damage actions, which were later consolidated, challenging visitation policies at the prison.  Plaintiffs, represented by Rural Legal Services of Tennessee, alleged that their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by strip and body cavity searches conducted on visitor plaintiffs, because they interfered with plaintiffs' right to freedom of association, they were done without probable cause, and they had a chilling effect on the inmate plaintiffs' rights to visitation.</p><p>On February 15, 1989, the district court (Judge James H. Jarvis) denied defendants' motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, finding they were not immune from liability as government officials.  The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal, which was granted.  </p><p>On April 3, 1991, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Boyce F. Martin) partially affirmed the denial of summary judgment based on plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claim that the searches violated their right to prison visitation, because according to Tennessee prison regulations, plaintiffs' visitation rights were mandatory and could not be removed without good cause.  Long v. Norris, 929 F.2d 1111 (6th Cir. 1991).  However, the court reversed the denial of summary judgment on the First and Fourth Amendment claims, finding defendants had qualified immunity based on plaintiffs' freedom of association and unreasonable search and seizure claims.  The court reversed the denial of summary judgment based on the First Amendment claim because plaintiffs did not allege that the defendants conducted the searches with the intent to discourage association or as a way to retaliate against the association.  Additionally, the court found that the prison visitors' constitutional rights to freedom from strip and body cavity searches absent probable cause were not clearly established at the time of the searches.  </p><p>On October 7, 1991, the Supreme Court denied defendants' petition for writ of certiorari.  Jones v. Long, 502 U.S. 863 (1991).</p><p></p>",

Norris, 929 F.2d 1111 (6th Cir. 1991), and a copy of the slip \nopinion appears in the Appendix hereto at la. The memorandum decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Tennessee also appears in the Appendix hereto at 15a. \n  \n*2 JURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was entered on April 3, 1991, and an order denying a petition to \nrehear was entered on April 29, 1991. This petition for certiorari was filed within ninety days of that date. This Court’s \njurisdiction is invoked under 28 U.S.C. § 1254(1). \n  \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS, STATUTES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES INVOLVED: \n42 U.S.C. § 1983: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or \nTerritory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States \nor other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, \nor other proper proceeding for redress. For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable \nexclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia. \n  \n  \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV: \nSection 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are \ncitizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law \nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state \ndeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within \nits jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \n  \n  \nState of Tennessee Department of Corrections Administrative Policies and Procedures. See Appendix at 24a-87a. \n  \n*3 STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  \nAt the time this action arose in 1984 and 1985, Petitioner, Otie Jones, was the Warden in Tennessee of the Morgan County \nRegional Correctional Facility (MCRCF), a state prison facility. Petitioner M.C. Hamby was the Associate Warden. Three \nconsolidated actions under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for damages were brought against these Wardens by three male inmates at \nMCRCF and their wives or fiancees alleging that the Wardens violated certain of the prison’s visitation policies regarding the \nsearching of prison visitors. Plaintiffs claim that these violations infringed the inmates’ First Amendment freedom of \nassociation to receive visitors, the Fourth Amendment right of prison visitors to be free of strip and/or body cavity searches \nwithout probable cause, and the inmates’ right of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. These applicable prison \nvisitation regulations were contained within the State of Tennessee Department of Correction Administrative Policies and \nProcedures which, in the section concerning the searching of visitors, required probable cause to order strip and/or body \ncavity searches of visitors. App. at 28a. Another section of the policies required a showing of good cause to suspend an \ninmate’s visitation rights. App. at 67a. \n  \nThe complaints allege that, in order to visit the plaintiff-inmates, the female visitors were required to consent to strip searches \nand/or body cavity searches which they generally consented to, failure to do so being cause under the prison policies to \nsuspend a visitor’s right to see an inmate. App. at 52a. At one point, the right of one of the wives to visit her husband was \nsuspended for 60 days due to her unwillingness to consent to a body cavity search. This is the only suspension of any \n\n1991 WL 11176810 \nvisitor’s right alleged in the case. The complaints do not allege that the lights of the male prisoners to receive visitors ever \nwas suspended. In fact the inmates’ right to receive visitors never was suspended. \n  \n*4 Petitioners filed motions for summary judgment claiming qualified immunity protection. The district court denied \nsummary judgment holding that the Wardens were not entitled to qualified immunity on the basis that the Fourth Amendment \nright of prison visitors to be free of strip and body cavity searches without probable cause or reasonable suspicion was clearly \nestablished in the Sixth Circuit at the time this action arose in 1984 and 1985. The complaints only alleged the searches were \nmade without probable cause and did not allege they were made without reasonable suspicion. Also, the district court held \nthat the First Amendment freedom of association of inmates to receive visitors was also clearly established at the time the \naction arose. \n  \nThe Sixth Circuit reversed in part holding that the Wardens were entitled to qualified immunity on the alleged Fourth \nAmendment violation of prison visitors’ right to be free of searches without probable cause. The visitor search rule required \nprobable cause to order the strip search or body cavity search of visitors. The Sixth Circuit found no constitutional violation \nbecause the right of visitors to be free of strip and/or body cavity searches without probable cause was not clearly established \nin the Sixth Circuit in 1984 and 1985. App. at 8a-10a. Although no constitutional violation was involved, the visitor searches \nnonetheless violated the prison rule requirement that visitors not be strip searched except for probable cause. The Sixth \nCircuit also reversed in part holding that the Wardens were protected by qualified immunity on the First Amendment \nviolation of inmates’ freedom of association to receive visitors. The Court held that this right also was not clearly established \nin the Sixth Circuit at the time the action arose. App. at 13a-14a. \n  \nThe Sixth Circuit affirmed in part holding that the violation of the visitor search rule, and subsequent suspension of a \nparticular visitor who refused to submit to *5 a search in order to visit an inmate, was a threat to the inmates’ liberty interest \nto receive visitors. App. at 10a-13a. The Court of Appeals determined that this liberty interest was created by a different \nsection of the policy concerning inmates’ visitation rights. App. at 11a-12a. The Sixth Circuit did not find that the Wardens \nviolated any substantive constitutional right belonging to the respondents. Nor did the Sixth Circuit find that the Wardens \ndirectly violated the inmates’ liberty interest to receive visitors but instead found that the suspension of a wife’s right to visit \nher inmate husband, due to her unwillingness to submit to a search, threatened or chilled the inmates’ right to receive visitors. \nThe inmates’ right to receive visitors was never suspended. \n  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT \nI. THE DECISION BELOW CONFLICTS WITH THE DECISIONS OF THIS COURT CONCERNING THE \nSTANDARDS TO BE APPLIED TO DETERMINE IF PRISON OFFICIALS ARE ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED \nIMMUNITY PROTECTION FOR VIOLATION OF THEIR OWN ADMINISTRATIVE RULES. \nThe administration of state prisons, in this age of burgeoning prison populations, is--at best--always difficult. The potential \nthat wardens will be faced with personal liability for violation of their own prison rules presents these officials with very \nconfusing and difficult dilemmas. This area of prison administration is made doubly difficult when there is the potential that a \nliberty interest may be created by the prison officials’ own rules. Prison officials are called upon daily to make a broad \nspectrum of administrative decisions concerning the full range of prison life. These diverse decisions can and do interact with, \nand in some way affect or conflict with, an interest created under another rule which may have sufficient mandatory language \nto be considered a liberty interest. Whether or not such interaction between diverse *6 rules will cause a warden to lose his \nimmunity is a very difficult puzzle for judges and lawyers to solve, much less prison officials. Even the Sixth Circuit below \nstated that “we venture once more into the labyrinth of deciding what makes a right ‘clearly established’ for purposes of \nqualified immunity.” App. at 5a (emphasis added). If solving this puzzle is a labyrinth for court of appeals judges, then prison \nwardens  are  faced  with  negotiating  a  mine  field.  This  case  presents  an  important  question  affecting  general  prison \nadministration throughout the states regarding the potential personal liability of prison officials when their administrative \nactions result in violation of their own rules. Petitioners urge this Court to give guidance and clarification in this important \narea of prison administration. \n  \nIn Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183 (1984), this Court held that “[o]fficials sued for constitutional violations do not lose their \nqualified immunity merely because their conduct violates some statutory or administrative provision.” Id. at 194. On that \noccasion, this Court explicitly refused to create a new rule which would remove officials’ qualified immunity for violation of \n\n1991 WL 11176810 \na clear state regulation because such a rule would make state officials “liable in an indeterminate amount for violation of any \nconstitutional  right-one  that  was  not  clearly  defined  or  perhaps  not  even  foreshadowed  at  the  time  of  the  alleged \nviolation--merely because their official conduct also violated some statute or regulation.” Id. at 195. In Davis, the regulation \nwhich was clearly violated did not itself give rise to the § 1983 action, as is the case here. The Court explained this \ndistinction as follows: \n[O]fficials sued for violation of rights conferred by a statute or regulation, like officials sued for violation \nof constitutional rights, do not forfeit their immunity by violating some other statute or regulation. Rather, \nthese officials become liable for damages only to the extent that there is a clear violation of the statutory \nrights that give rise to the cause of action *7 for damages .... Neither federal nor state officials lose their \nimmunity by violating the clear command of a statute or regulation-of federal or of state law -unless that \nstatute or regulation provides the basis for the cause of action sued upon. \n  \n  \n468 U.S. at 193 n.12 (emphasis in original). \n  \nA. The Sixth Circuit’s Decision Conflicts With The Decisions Of This Court By Forfeiting Prison Warden’s Qualified \nImmunity For Violation Of A Prison Rule, Not Giving Rise To The § 1983 Action, Which Threatened A Liberty \nInterest Created By Another Rule. \nIn the decision below, the Sixth Circuit while acknowledging this Court’s decision in Davis v. Scherer, clearly misstated the \nDavis rule in its following statement: “As we have stated, ‘The Supreme Court has determined that violation of a clearly \nestablished state regulation is sufficient to cause officials to forfeit their qualified immunity’ for claims of deprivation of \nfederal constitutional guarantees.”1 App. at 10a. Of course, the holding in Davis v. Scherer is that violation of a clear state \nregulation does not cause officials to lose their qualified immunity when sued for constitutional violations unless the rule \nitself gives rise to the cause of action. Standing the Davis rule on its head, the Sixth Circuit has in effect adopted a new \nqualified immunity rule directly conflicting with this Court’s prior refusal to adopt such a rule. In Davis a new qualified \nimmunity rule was proposed to be “limited by requiring that plaintiffs allege clear violation of a statute or regulation that \nadvanced important interests or was designed to protect constitutional rights.” 468 U.S. at 195. This Court, refusing to open \nthe door to such a liberalized rule, explained that \n  \nonce the door is opened to such inquiries, it is difficult to limit their scope in any principled manner. Federal judges would be \ngranted large discretion to ex- *8 tract from various statutory and administrative codes those provisions that seem to them \nsufficiently clear or important to warrant denial of qualified immunity. And such judgments fairly could be made only after \nan extensive inquiry into whether the official in the circumstances of his decision should have appreciated the applicability \nand importance of the rule at issue. It would become more difficult, not only for officials to anticipate the possible legal \nconsequences of their conduct, but also for trial courts to decide even frivolous suits without protracted litigation. \n  \n468 U.S. at 195-96. \n  \nThe Sixth Circuit, based upon the criteria first clearly established in Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, --- U.S. ---, \n109 S.Ct. 1904 (1989), determined that section 507.01 of the Tennessee Department of Corrections policies regarding \nvisitation lights of inmates created a liberty interest in visitation. App. at 11a. The Sixth Circuit erroneously concluded that, \nbecause the inmate visitation rule was couched in sufficiently explicit mandatory language, an indirect threat to the inmates’ \nvisitation right as a result of the Wardens violating a different visitor search rule and the subsequent suspension of the right of \none particular visitor to visit her husband after her refusal to submit to the search, “violated clearly established law.” App. at \n12a. The “clearly established law” that the Sixth Circuit referred to was this Court’s decision in Thompson, which is not a \nqualified immunity case but rather is the case which first clearly established the standards by which a state may create a \nliberty interest in prison visitation rules when the rule  uses “explicitly  mandatory language” in connection  with the \nestablishment of “specific substantive predicates to limit discretion.” 109 S.Ct. at 1910. \n  \nSince the rule which the Court found that the Wardens clearly violated, Section 506.06 of the prison policies on “Searches,” \nApp. at 28a, by conducting strip searches of visitors without probable cause, did not result (as *9 determined by the Sixth \nCircuit) in any constitutional violation, it provided no basis for a § 1983 action against the Wardens. Nor did the Sixth Circuit \nactually find a direct violation of the inmate visitation rule and resulting liberty interest but only “[t]hreats to remove this \n\n1991 WL 11176810 \nvisitation right.” App. at 12a. Absent a clear violation of the “rights that give rise to the cause of action for damages,” \nofficials do not lose their immunity. Davis, 468 U.S. at 194 n.12. The Court of Appeals erred in removing the Wardens’ \nqualified immunity for violation of a different rule other than the inmate visitation regulation. An indirect threat of the \ninmates’ liberty interest, which the Court found created by the inmate visitation rule, does not give rise to any protection \nunder the Due Process Clause. The Sixth Circuit’s decision clearly violates this Court’s ruling in Davis that “officials sued \nfor violation of rights enforced by a ... regulation ... do not forfeit their immunity by violating some other ... regulation.” Id. \n(emphasis in original). \n  \nB. The Legal Standard Applied By The Court Of Appeals, To Determine If The Inmate Visitation Rule Created A \nLiberty Interest, Was Not “Clearly Established” Until Four Years After The Officials’ Action --In Violation Of This \nCourt’s Requirements. \nAlthough the Sixth Circuit acknowledged the “objective legal reasonableness” standard of Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. \n800, 819 (1982), “assessed in light of the legal rules that were ‘clearly established’ at the time [the official action] was \ntaken,” Anderson v. Creighton, 638 U.S. 635, 639 (1987), it nonetheless erred in applying legal standards first clearly \nestablished by this Court’s Thompson decision in 1989 to test whether the 1984-85 actions of the Wardens violated a \nprotected liberty interest. See also Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985)2. Until Thompson, decided four years after the \n*10 official conduct challenged in this case, the standards simply were not clearly established to determine if prison visitation \nregulations create a liberty interest subject to the Due Process Clause. In Harlow  this Court stated that “[i]f the law at the \ntime was not clearly established, an official could not reasonably be expected to anticipate subsequent legal developments, \nnor could he fairly be said to ‘know’ that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.” 457 U.S. at 818. In \nspite of this, the Sixth Circuit reasoned that applying Thompson’s criteria to the Wardens’ actions in 1984 and 1985 “does not \nviolate the rule that public officials are accountable only for laws that were clearly established at the time of their actions,” \nbecause “Thompson reflected the state of clearly established law in 1985-the time of the visitation in that case.” App. at 11a \nn.4. This twisted logic clearly violates the requirements of Harlow and Anderson. This Court’s 1989 Thompson decision \ncannot be applied in this case to determine if the Wardens’ conduct in 1984 and 1985 is to be protected by qualified \nimmunity. The Wardens could not know then what this court would establish four years later as the applicable standards to \ndetermine if a prison visitation rule created a liberty interest. Nor could they have known that they might lose their immunity \nif they violated some general rule which affected or threatened the right protected under a liberty interest then unknown to \nthem. \n  \nAlso in Anderson. v. Creighton, 638 U.S. 635 (1987), this Court established the requirement that, in testing qualified \nimmunity protection, determination is to be *11 made whether a reasonable official could have believed that his actions \ncomported with constitutional requirements even though it actually did not. The Sixth Circuit failed to make this inquiry. Had \nit done so, it readily could have found that the Wardens could have believed their actions did not violate any liberty interest \nand violated no due process requirement. The Wardens could have believed, on the basis of this Court’s decision in Hewitt v. \nHelms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983), as specifically noted in Thompson, “that the denial of prison access to a particular visitor ‘is \nwell within the terms of confinement ordinarily contemplated by a prison sentence,’ Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S., at 468, 103 S. \nCt., at 869, and therefore is not ‘independently protected by the Due Process Clause.” 109 S.Ct. at 1909; accord, Jones v. \nNorth Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, 433 U.S. 119 (1977); Bellamy v. Bradley, 729 F.2d 416 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 \nU.S. 485 (1984), a prisoner has no constitutional right to meet with a particular visitor of his choice; a visitor has no \nconstitutional right to visit a particular inmate. \n  \nThere appears to be no question that the inmate received some notice that his wife’s visitation right had been suspended for \nher unwillingness to submit to a search. The inmates at MCRCF have the right to file a grievance over any non-disciplinary \nmatter including visitation. App. beginning at 78a. The Wardens could have believed that the availability of the grievance \nprocedure met the due process requirements for a threatened liberty interest in light of the existing decision of this Court in \nHewitt. There, faced with a clear liberty violation regarding disciplinary action against an inmate being placed into restrictive \nconfinement, this Court held the prisoner was entitled only to “an informal, nonadversary evidentiary review” and the \n“inmate must merely receive some notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present his views....” 459 U.S. at \n476. According to Hewitt, “[o]rdinarily a written statement by the in- *12 mate will accomplish this purpose....” Id. The due \nprocess proceeding need not occur prior to the action which allegedly violates the liberty interest but “must occur within a \nreasonable time following [the official action] taking into account the relatively insubstantial private interest at stake and the \n\n1991 WL 11176810 \ntraditionally broad discretion of prison officials.” Id. at 476 n.8. The Wardens easily could have believed that the availability \nto an inmate of the grievance procedures shortly after the suspension of a wife’s visitation rights would satisfy any due \nprocess requirements of Hewitt. There is no allegation that the inmates ever sought to invoke these grievance procedures. \n  \nII. PRISON RULES WHICH DO NOT AFFECT THE DURATION, RELEASE, OR THE VERY NATURE OF \nPRISON CONFINEMENT SHOULD NOT CREATE LIBERTY INTERESTS PROTECTED BY THE DUE \nPROCESS CLAUSE. \nSince the prison visitation regulation in Thompson did not create a liberty interest, it was unnecessary then to express a view \non whether this Court should \nadopt a rule that prison regulations, regardless of the mandatory character of their language or the extent to which they limit \nofficial discretion, “do not create an entitlement protected by the Due Process Clause when they do not affect the duration or \nrelease from confinement, or the very nature of confinement....” \n  \n  \n109 S.Ct. at 109 n.3 (quoting brief for petitioners at 10). The Thompson petitioners urged that establishing “this bright line \nwould allow prison officials to issue guidelines to prison staff to govern minor decisions, without thereby transforming the \ndetails of prison life into ‘liberty interests’ with accompanying procedural rights. Inasmuch as a ‘bright line’ of this kind [was] \nnot necessary for a ruling in favor of petitioners,” the Court in Thompson left “its resolution for another day.” Id. \n  \n*13 Hopefully, that day has come. Petitioners urge the Court to consider now the question whether such a “bright line” for \nprison administrative rules should be established. There are compelling reasons to do so. Prison- officials throughout the \nstates  are  faced  with  serious  potential  for  loss  of  immunity  when  their  decisions  implementing  day-to-day  prison \nadministrative rules fail to recognize, in light of the standards established in Thompson, that a general rule may create a \nliberty interest or that the interaction of various general rules may affect a right under another rule which a district court or \ncourt of appeals later determines created a liberty interest. \n  \nPrior to Thompson, the Davis rule protected prison officials from personal liability for rule violations unless the rule violated \ngave rise to the cause of action. Now since Thompson, a violation of any rule on any general subject matter of prison life may \ncause a warden to lose his immunity if a federal court later determines that the rule created a liberty interest by use of \nsufficiently explicit mandatory language with a substantive predicate limiting discretion.3 However, to simply illustrate how \ndifficult this task can be, consider the fact that the court of appeals judges in Thompson reached a different conclusion than \nthis Court as to whether the prison visitation rule there created a liberty interest. When the leading jurists in the nation can \nfairly disagree on whether a prison rule creates a liberty interest, then wardens, who are not judges or even attorneys, are \nfaced with an insurmountable task. In Davis, this Court found strong policy reasons why officials should not generally be \npersonally liable for administrative rule violations: \n  \n*14 Officials would be required not only to know the applicable regulations, but also to understand the intent with which \neach regulation was adopted. Such an understanding often eludes even trained lawyers with full access to the relevant \nlegislative or administrative materials. It is unfair and impracticable to require such an understanding of public officials \ngenerally. \n  \n468 U.S. at 196 n.13. \n  \nIf this Sixth Circuit decision is allowed to stand, wardens would additionally be required to know how the violation of one \nrule, not creating a liberty interest, could impact on another rule which a court subsequently may find did create a liberty \ninterest. This is not only unfair but essentially an impossible As this Court stated in Davis, it is not \n[a]lways fair, or sound policy, to demand official compliance with statute and regulation on pain of money damages. Such \nofficials as police officers or prison wardens, to say nothing of higher level executives who enjoy only qualified immunity, \nroutinely make close decisions in the exercise of the broad authority that necessarily is delegated to them. These officials are \nsubject to a plethora of rules, “often so voluminous, ambiguous, and contradictory, and in such flux that officials can only \ncomply with or enforce them selectively. See P. Schuck, Suing Government 66 (1983). In these circumstances, officials \nshould not err always on the side of caution. “[O]fficials with a broad range of duties and authority must often act swiftly and \nfirmly at the risk that action deferred will be futile or constitute virtual abdication of office.” \n\n1991 WL 11176810 \n  \n  \nId. at 196. \n  \n*15 However, if a warden acts swiftly and does “not err always on the side of caution,” he may become personally liable for \nviolation of a general rule not involving the very nature of confinement which later is determined to have created a liberty \ninterest. Faced with this impossible task, a “bright line” needs to be established that liberty interests may only be created by \nprison rules relating to the nature of confinement. This Court’s prior decisions have found the existence of liberty interests \nonly when the prison rule involved the duration of, or release from confinement, or that the very nature of confinement was \nsomehow dramatically altered.4 Since visitation rules and other general rules of prison management do not involve the \nduration of or release from confinement, no due process right would be implicated in this case if such a “bright line” were \nestablished. \n  \nIncarceration necessarily restricts an inmate’s liberty and such restrictions of liberty are within the overall limitations to be \nexpected in a penal institution unless the conditions are “cruel and unusual” or unjustifiably interfere with substantive rights. \nRhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337 (1981). An inmate has no constitutional right to meet with any visitor of his choice. \nNeither do prison visitors have a fundamental right to visit specific inmates. Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, \n433 U.S. 119 (1977); *16 Bellamy v. Bradley, 729 F.2d 416 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 469 (1984). For instance, as this \nCourt explained in Jones: \nIn a prison context, an inmate does not retain those First Amendment rights that are “inconsistent with his status as a prisoner \nor with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.” Pell v. Procunier, supra at 822. Prisons, it is obvious, \ndiffer in numerous respects from free society. They, to begin with, are populated, involuntarily, by people who have been \nfound to have violated one or more of the criminal laws established by society for its orderly governance. In seeking a \n“mutual accommodation between institutional needs and objectives [of prisons] and the provisions of the Constitution that \nare of general application,” Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S., at 556, this Court has repeatedly recognized the need for major \nrestrictions on a prisoner’s rights. \n  \n  \n433 U.S. at 129. \n  \nThis necessarily expected withdrawal and limitation of an inmate’s liberty and privileges has previously caused this Court in \nHewitt to express its concern over the expansion of liberty interests created by prison rules into the general areas of prison \nlife: \nWe have repeatedly said both that prison officials have broad administrative and discretionary authority over the institutions \nthey manage and that lawfully incarcerated persons retain only a narrow range of protected liberty interests. As to the first \npoint, we have recognized that broad discretionary authority is necessary because the administration of a prison is “at best an \nextraordinarily difficult undertaking.” Wolff v. McDonnell, supra, at 566 ..., and have concluded that “to hold ... that any \nsubstantial deprivation imposed by prison authorities triggers the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause would \nsubject to judicial review a wide spectrum of discretionary actions that traditionally have been the business of prison \nadministrators rather than of the federal courts.” Meachum v. Fano, supra, at 225. *17 .... As to the second point, our \ndecisions have consistently refused to recognize more than the most basic liberty interests in prisoners. “Lawful incarceration \nbrings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations \nunderlying our penal system.” Price v. Johnston, 344 US 266, 285 .... As we have held previously, these decisions require \nthat “[a]s long as the conditions or degree of confinement to which the prisoner is subjected is within the sentence imposed \nupon him and is not otherwise violative of the Constitution, the Due Process Clause does not in itself subject an inmate’s \ntreatment by prison authorities to judicial oversight.” Montanye v. Haymes, 427 US 236, 242 .... \n  \n  \n459 U.S. at 467-68. \n  \nIn Hewitt, a prison regulation, regarding restrictive confinement of a prisoner who was disciplined for engaging in a riot \ncausing serious injury to prison guards, was found to create a liberty interest. Even then, the nature of confinement was \naltered. However, this Court stated there were “persuasive reasons why we should be loath to transpose all of the reasoning in \nthe cases just cited” to create a liberty interest in “the situation where the statute and regulations govern the day-to-day \nadministration of a prison system.” Id. at 470. The Court was loath to do so because “the safe and efficient operation of a \nprison on a day-to-day basis has traditionally been entrusted to the expertise of prison officials,” and the “deprivations \n\n1991 WL 11176810 \nimposed in the course of the daily operations of an institution are likely to be minor when compared to the release from \ncustody at issue in parole decisions and good time credits.” Id. This Court stated that “[t]hese facts suggest ‘that regulations \nstructuring the authority of prison administrators may warrant treatment, for purposes of creation of entitlements to ‘liberty,’ \ndifferent from statutes and regulations in other areas.’ ” Id. (emphasis added). \n  \n*18  The  Court  should  now  consider  this  important  question  and  decide  whether  lawful  incarceration  warrants  the \nestablishment of a “bright line” beyond which prison regulations should not create liberty interests protected by the Due \nProcess Clause unless the rules involve the duration of, release from, or the very nature of confinement. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, a writ of certiorari should issue to review the judgment and opinion of the Sixth Circuit. \n  \n \n ",

See Appendix at \n24a-87a. \n*3 STATEMENT OF THE CASE \nAt the time this action arose in 1984 and 1985, Petitioner, Otie Jones, was the Warden in Tennessee of \nthe Morgan County Regional Correctional Facility (MCRCF), a state prison facility. Petitioner M.C. \nHamby was the Associate Warden. Three consolidated actions under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for damages \nwere brought against these Wardens by three male inmates at MCRCF and their wives or fiancees \nalleging that the Wardens violated certain of the prison's visitation policies regarding the searching of \nprison visitors. Plaintiffs claim that these violations infringed the inmates' First Amendment freedom of \nassociation to receive visitors, the Fourth Amendment right of prison visitors to be free of strip and/or \nbody cavity searches without probable cause, and the inmates' right of due process under the Fourteenth \nAmendment. These applicable prison visitation regulations were contained within the State of Tennessee \nDepartment of Correction Administrative Policies and Procedures which, in the section concerning the \nsearching of visitors, required probable cause to order strip and/or body cavity searches of visitors. App. \nat 28a. Another section of the policies required a showing of good cause to suspend an inmate's \nvisitation rights. App. at 67a. \nThe complaints allege that, in order to visit the plaintiff-inmates, the female visitors were required to \nconsent to strip searches and/or body cavity searches which they generally consented to, failure to do so \nbeing cause under the prison policies to suspend a visitor's right to see an inmate. App. at 52a. At one \npoint, the right of one of the wives to visit her husband was suspended for 60 days due to her \nunwillingness to consent to a body cavity search. This is the only suspension of any visitor's right \nalleged in the case. The complaints do not allege that the lights of the male prisoners to receive visitors \never was suspended. In fact the inmates' right to receive visitors never was suspended. \n*4 Petitioners filed motions for summary judgment claiming qualified immunity protection. The district \ncourt denied summary judgment holding that the Wardens were not entitled to qualified immunity on the \nbasis that the Fourth Amendment right of prison visitors to be free of strip and body cavity searches \nwithout probable cause or reasonable suspicion was clearly established in the Sixth Circuit at the time \nthis action arose in 1984 and 1985. The complaints only alleged the searches were made without \nprobable cause and did not allege they were made without reasonable suspicion. Also, the district court \nheld that the First Amendment freedom of association of inmates to receive visitors was also clearly \nestablished at the time the action arose. \nThe Sixth Circuit reversed in part holding that the Wardens were entitled to qualified immunity on the \nalleged Fourth Amendment violation of prison visitors' right to be free of searches without probable \ncause. The visitor search rule required probable cause to order the strip search or body cavity search of \nvisitors. The Sixth Circuit found no constitutional violation because the right of visitors to be free of \nstrip and/or body cavity searches without probable cause was not clearly established in the Sixth Circuit \nin 1984 and 1985. App. at 8a-10a. Although no constitutional violation was involved, the visitor \nhttp://web2.westlaw.com/result/documenttext.aspx?docsample=False&sv=Split&service=... 5/18/2006\n\n1991 WL 11176810 Page 5of 11\nsearches nonetheless violated the prison rule requirement that visitors not be strip searched except for \nprobable cause. The Sixth Circuit also reversed in part holding that the Wardens were protected by \nqualified immunity on the First Amendment violation of inmates' freedom of association to receive \nvisitors. The Court held that this right also was not clearly established in the Sixth Circuit at the time the \naction arose. App. at 13a-14a. \nThe Sixth Circuit affirmed in part holding that the violation of the visitor search rule, and subsequent \nsuspension of a particular visitor who refused to submit to *5 a search in order to visit an inmate, was a \nthreat to the inmates' liberty interest to receive visitors. App. at 10a-13a. The Court of Appeals \ndetermined that this liberty interest was created by a different section of the policy concerning inmates' \nvisitation rights. App. at 11a-12a. The Sixth Circuit did not find that the Wardens violated any \nsubstantive constitutional right belonging to the respondents. Nor did the Sixth Circuit find that the \nWardens directly violated the inmates' liberty interest to receive visitors but instead found that the \nsuspension of a wife's right to visit her inmate husband, due to her unwillingness to submit to a search, \nthreatened or chilled the inmates' right to receive visitors. The inmates' right to receive visitors was \nnever suspended. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT \nI. THE DECISION BELOW CONFLICTS WITH THE DECISIONS OF THIS COURT \nCONCERNING THE STANDARDS TO BE APPLIED TO DETERMINE IF PRISON OFFICIALS \nARE ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY PROTECTION FOR VIOLATION OF THEIR OWN \nADMINISTRATIVE RULES. \nThe administration of state prisons, in this age of burgeoning prison populations, is--at best--always \ndifficult. The potential that wardens will be faced with personal liability for violation of their own prison \nrules presents these officials with very confusing and difficult dilemmas. This area of prison \nadministration is made doubly difficult when there is the potential that a liberty interest may be created \nby the prison officials' own rules. Prison officials are called upon daily to make a broad spectrum of \nadministrative decisions concerning the full range of prison life. These diverse decisions can and do \ninteract with, and in some way affect or conflict with, an interest created under another rule which may \nhave sufficient mandatory language to be considered a liberty interest. Whether or not such interaction \nbetween diverse *6 rules will cause a warden to lose his immunity is a very difficult puzzle for judges \nand lawyers to solve, much less prison officials. Even the Sixth Circuit below stated that \"we venture \nonce more into the labyrinth of deciding what makes a right 'clearly established' for purposes of \nqualified immunity.\" App. at 5a (emphasis added). If solving this puzzle is a labyrinth for court of \nappeals judges, then prison wardens are faced with negotiating a mine field. This case presents an \nimportant question affecting general prison administration throughout the states regarding the potential \npersonal liability of prison officials when their administrative actions result in violation of their own \nrules. Petitioners urge this Court to give guidance and clarification in this important area of prison \nadministration. \nIn Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183 (1984), this Court held that \"[o]fficials sued for constitutional \nviolations do not lose their qualified immunity merely because their conduct violates some statutory or \nadministrative provision.\" Id. at 194. On that occasion, this Court explicitly refused to create a new rule \nwhich would remove officials' qualified immunity for violation of a clear state regulation because such a \nrule would make state officials \"liable in an indeterminate amount for violation of any constitutional \nright-one that was not clearly defined or perhaps not even foreshadowed at the time of the alleged \nviolation--merely because their official conduct also violated some statute or regulation.\" Id. at 195. In \nDavis, the regulation which was clearly violated did not itself give rise to the § 1983 action, as is the \ncase here. The Court explained this distinction as follows:  \n[O]fficials sued for violation of rights conferred by a statute or regulation, like officials sued for \nviolation of constitutional rights, do not forfeit their immunity by violating some other statute or \nregulation. Rather, these officials become liable for damages only to the extent that there is a clear \nviolation of the statutory rights that give rise to the cause of action *7 for damages .... Neither federal \nnor state officials lose their immunity by violating the clear command of a statute or regulation-of \nhttp://web2.westlaw.com/result/documenttext.aspx?docsample=False&sv=Split&service=... 5/18/2006\n\n1991 WL 11176810 Page 6of 11\nfederal or of state law -unless that statute or regulation provides the basis for the cause of action sued \nupon.  \n468 U.S. at 193 n.12 (emphasis in original). \nA. The Sixth Circuit's Decision Conflicts With The Decisions Of This Court By Forfeiting Prison \nWarden's Qualified Immunity For Violation Of A Prison Rule, Not Giving Rise To The § 1983 Action, \nWhich Threatened A Liberty Interest Created By Another Rule. \nIn the decision below, the Sixth Circuit while acknowledging this Court's decision in Davis v. Scherer, \nclearly misstated the Davis rule in its following statement: \"As we have stated, 'The Supreme Court has \ndetermined that violation of a clearly established state regulation is sufficient to cause officials to forfeit \ntheir qualified immunity' for claims of deprivation of federal constitutional guarantees.\" [FN1] App. at \n10a. Of course, the holding in Davis v. Scherer is that violation of a clear state regulation does not cause \nofficials to lose their qualified immunity when sued for constitutional violations unless the rule itself \ngives rise to the cause of action. Standing the Davis rule on its head, the Sixth Circuit has in effect \nadopted a new qualified immunity rule directly conflicting with this Court's prior refusal to adopt such a \nrule. In Davis a new qualified immunity rule was proposed to be \"limited by requiring that plaintiffs \nallege clear violation of a statute or regulation that advanced important interests or was designed to \nprotect constitutional rights.\" 468 U.S. at 195. This Court, refusing to open the door to such a liberalized \nrule, explained that \n \nFN1. Quoting from Spruytte v. Walters, 753 F.2d 498, 510 (6th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 \nU.S. 1054 (1986). \n \n \nonce the door is opened to such inquiries, it is difficult to limit their scope in any principled manner. \nFederal judges would be granted large discretion to ex-*8tract from various statutory and administrative \ncodes those provisions that seem to them sufficiently clear or important to warrant denial of qualified \nimmunity. And such judgments fairly could be made only after an extensive inquiry into whether the \nofficial in the circumstances of his decision should have appreciated the applicability and importance of \nthe rule at issue. It would become more difficult, not only for officials to anticipate the possible legal \nconsequences of their conduct, but also for trial courts to decide even frivolous suits without protracted \nlitigation.  \n468 U.S. at 195-96. \nThe Sixth Circuit, based upon the criteria first clearly established in Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. \nThompson, --- U.S. ---, 109 S.Ct. 1904 (1989), determined that section 507.01 of the Tennessee \nDepartment of Corrections policies regarding visitation lights of inmates created a liberty interest in \nvisitation. App. at 11a. The Sixth Circuit erroneously concluded that, because the inmate visitation rule \nwas couched in sufficiently explicit mandatory language, an indirect threat to the inmates' visitation \nright as a result of the Wardens violating a different visitor search rule and the subsequent suspension of \nthe right of one particular visitor to visit her husband after her refusal to submit to the search, \"violated \nclearly established law.\" App. at 12a. The \"clearly established law\" that the Sixth Circuit referred to was \nthis Court's decision in Thompson, which is not a qualified immunity case but rather is the case which \nfirst clearly established the standards by which a state may create a liberty interest in prison visitation \nrules when the rule uses \"explicitly mandatory language\" in connection with the establishment of \n\"specific substantive predicates to limit discretion.\" 109 S.Ct. at 1910. \nSince the rule which the Court found that the Wardens clearly violated, Section 506.06 of the prison \npolicies on \"Searches,\" App. at 28a, by conducting strip searches of visitors without probable cause, did \nnot result (as *9 determined by the Sixth Circuit) in any constitutional violation, it provided no basis for \na § 1983 action against the Wardens. Nor did the Sixth Circuit actually find a direct violation of the \ninmate visitation rule and resulting liberty interest but only \"[t]hreats to remove this visitation right.\" \nApp. at 12a. Absent a clear violation of the \"rights that give rise to the cause of action for damages,\" \nhttp://web2.westlaw.com/result/documenttext.aspx?docsample=False&sv=Split&service=... 5/18/2006\n\n1991 WL 11176810 Page 7of 11\nofficials do not lose their immunity. Davis, 468 U.S. at 194 n.12. The Court of Appeals erred in \nremoving the Wardens' qualified immunity for violation of a different rule other than the inmate \nvisitation regulation. An indirect threat of the inmates' liberty interest, which the Court found created by \nthe inmate visitation rule, does not give rise to any protection under the Due Process Clause. The Sixth \nCircuit's decision clearly violates this Court's ruling in Davis that \"officials sued for violation of rights \nenforced by a ... regulation ... do not forfeit their immunity by violating some other ... regulation.\" Id. \n(emphasis in original). \nB. The Legal Standard Applied By The Court Of Appeals, To Determine If The Inmate Visitation Rule \nCreated A Liberty Interest, Was Not \"Clearly Established\" Until Four Years After The Officials' Action \n--In Violation Of This Court's Requirements. \nAlthough the Sixth Circuit acknowledged the \"objective legal reasonableness\" standard of Harlow v. \nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 819 (1982), \"assessed in light of the legal rules that were 'clearly established' \nat the time [the official action] was taken,\" Anderson v. Creighton, 638 U.S. 635, 639 (1987), it \nnonetheless erred in applying legal standards first clearly established by this Court's Thompson decision \nin 1989 to test whether the 1984-85 actions of the Wardens violated a protected liberty interest. See also \nMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985) [FN2]. Until Thompson, decided four years after the *10 \nofficial conduct challenged in this case, the standards simply were not clearly established to determine if \nprison visitation regulations create a liberty interest subject to the Due Process Clause. In Harlow this \nCourt stated that \"[i]f the law at the time was not clearly established, an official could not reasonably be \nexpected to anticipate subsequent legal developments, nor could he fairly be said to 'know' that the law \nforbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.\" 457 U.S. at 818. In spite of this, the Sixth Circuit \nreasoned that applying Thompson's criteria to the Wardens' actions in 1984 and 1985 \"does not violate \nthe rule that public officials are accountable only for laws that were clearly established at the time of \ntheir actions,\" because \"Thompson reflected the state of clearly established law in 1985-the time of the \nvisitation in that case.\" App. at 11a n.4. This twisted logic clearly violates the requirements of Harlow \nand Anderson. This Court's 1989 Thompson decision cannot be applied in this case to determine if the \nWardens' conduct in 1984 and 1985 is to be protected by qualified immunity. The Wardens could not \nknow then what this court would establish four years later as the applicable standards to determine if a \nprison visitation rule created a liberty interest. Nor could they have known that they might lose their \nimmunity if they violated some general rule which affected or threatened the right protected under a \nliberty interest then unknown to them. \n \nFN2. Officials are immune unless the law clearly proscribes the actions taken. Harlow v. \nFitzgerald, supra. \"[O]fficials can act without fear of  \nharassing litigation only if they reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise \nto liability for damages and only if unjustified lawsuits are quickly terminated.\" Davis v. \nScherer, supra, at 195. Qualified immunity protects \"all but the plainly incompetent or \nthose who knowingly violate the law.\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986). \"The \ncontours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand \nthat what he is doing violates that right.\" Anderson, supra at 640. \n \n \nAlso in Anderson. v. Creighton, 638 U.S. 635 (1987), this Court established the requirement that, in \ntesting qualified immunity protection, determination is to be *11 made whether a reasonable official \ncould have believed that his actions comported with constitutional requirements even though it actually \ndid not. The Sixth Circuit failed to make this inquiry. Had it done so, it readily could have found that the \nWardens could have believed their actions did not violate any liberty interest and violated no due \nprocess requirement. The Wardens could have believed, on the basis of this Court's decision in Hewitt v. \nHelms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983), as specifically noted in Thompson, \"that the denial of prison access to a \nhttp://web2.westlaw.com/result/documenttext.aspx?docsample=False&sv=Split&service=... 5/18/2006\n\n1991 WL 11176810 Page 8of 11\nparticular visitor 'is well within the terms of confinement ordinarily contemplated by a prison sentence,' \nHewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S., at 468, 103 S. Ct., at 869, and therefore is not 'independently protected by the \nDue Process Clause.\" 109 S.Ct. at 1909; accord, Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, 433 \nU.S. 119 (1977); Bellamy v. Bradley, 729 F.2d 416 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 485 (1984), a \nprisoner has no constitutional right to meet with a particular visitor of his choice; a visitor has no \nconstitutional right to visit a particular inmate. \nThere appears to be no question that the inmate received some notice that his wife's visitation right had \nbeen suspended for her unwillingness to submit to a search. The inmates at MCRCF have the right to \nfile a grievance over any non-disciplinary matter including visitation. App. beginning at 78a. The \nWardens could have believed that the availability of the grievance procedure met the due process \nrequirements for a threatened liberty interest in light of the existing decision of this Court in Hewitt. \nThere, faced with a clear liberty violation regarding disciplinary action against an inmate being placed \ninto restrictive confinement, this Court held the prisoner was entitled only to \"an informal, nonadversary \nevidentiary review\" and the \"inmate must merely receive some notice of the charges against him and an \nopportunity to present his views....\" 459 U.S. at 476. According to Hewitt, \"[o]rdinarily a written \nstatement by the in-*12 mate will accomplish this purpose....\" Id. The due process proceeding need not \noccur prior to the action which allegedly violates the liberty interest but \"must occur within a reasonable \ntime following [the official action] taking into account the relatively insubstantial private interest at \nstake and the traditionally broad discretion of prison officials.\" Id. at 476 n.8. The Wardens easily could \nhave believed that the availability to an inmate of the grievance procedures shortly after the suspension \nof a wife's visitation rights would satisfy any due process requirements of Hewitt. There is no allegation \nthat the inmates ever sought to invoke these grievance procedures. \nII. PRISON RULES WHICH DO NOT AFFECT THE DURATION, RELEASE, OR THE VERY \nNATURE OF PRISON CONFINEMENT SHOULD NOT CREATE LIBERTY INTERESTS \nPROTECTED BY THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. \nSince the prison visitation regulation in Thompson did not create a liberty interest, it was unnecessary \nthen to express a view on whether this Court should  \nadopt a rule that prison regulations, regardless of the mandatory character of their language or the extent \nto which they limit official discretion, \"do not create an entitlement protected by the Due Process Clause \nwhen they do not affect the duration or release from confinement, or the very nature of confinement....\" \n109 S.Ct. at 109 n.3 (quoting brief for petitioners at 10). The Thompson petitioners urged that \nestablishing \"this bright line would allow prison officials to issue guidelines to prison staff to govern \nminor decisions, without thereby transforming the details of prison life into 'liberty interests' with \naccompanying procedural rights. Inasmuch as a 'bright line' of this kind [was] not necessary for a ruling \nin favor of petitioners,\" the Court in Thompson left \"its resolution for another day.\" Id. \n*13 Hopefully, that day has come. Petitioners urge the Court to consider now the question whether such \na \"bright line\" for prison administrative rules should be established. There are compelling reasons to do \nso. Prison- officials throughout the states are faced with serious potential for loss of immunity when \ntheir decisions implementing day-to-day prison administrative rules fail to recognize, in light of the \nstandards established in Thompson, that a general rule may create a liberty interest or that the interaction \nof various general rules may affect a right under another rule which a district court or court of appeals \nlater determines created a liberty interest. \nPrior to Thompson, the Davis rule protected prison officials from personal liability for rule violations \nunless the rule violated gave rise to the cause of action. Now since Thompson, a violation of any rule on \nany general subject matter of prison life may cause a warden to lose his immunity if a federal court later \ndetermines that the rule created a liberty interest by use of sufficiently explicit mandatory language with \na substantive predicate limiting discretion. [FN3] However, to simply illustrate how difficult this task \ncan be, consider the fact that the court of appeals judges in Thompson reached a different conclusion \nthan this Court as to whether the prison visitation rule there created a liberty interest. When the leading \njurists in the nation can fairly disagree on whether a prison rule creates a liberty interest, then wardens, \nwho are not judges or even attorneys, are faced with an insurmountable task. In Davis, this Court found \nhttp://web2.westlaw.com/result/documenttext.aspx?docsample=False&sv=Split&service=... 5/18/2006\n\n1991 WL 11176810 Page 9of 11\nstrong policy reasons why officials should not generally be personally liable for administrative rule \nviolations: \n \nFN3. This prospect contradicts this Court's holdings that federal courts should not become \ninvolved in the day-to-day operation of state correctional facilities. Meachum v. Fano, 427 \nU.S. 215, 229 (1976) ; Preiser v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 475, 491-92 (1973); Procunier v. \nMartinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974); Cruz v. Beto. 405 U.S. 319, 321 (1972); Johnson v. Avery, \n393 U.S. 483, 486 (1969). \n \n \n*14 Officials would be required not only to know the applicable regulations, but also to understand the \nintent with which each regulation was adopted. Such an understanding often eludes even trained lawyers \nwith full access to the relevant legislative or administrative materials. It is unfair and impracticable to \nrequire such an understanding of public officials generally.  \n468 U.S. at 196 n.13. \nIf this Sixth Circuit decision is allowed to stand, wardens would additionally be required to know how \nthe violation of one rule, not creating a liberty interest, could impact on another rule which a court \nsubsequently may find did create a liberty interest. This is not only unfair but essentially an impossible \nAs this Court stated in Davis, it is not  \n[a]lways fair, or sound policy, to demand official compliance with statute and regulation on pain of \nmoney damages. Such officials as police officers or prison wardens, to say nothing of higher level \nexecutives who enjoy only qualified immunity, routinely make close decisions in the exercise of the \nbroad authority that necessarily is delegated to them. These officials are subject to a plethora of rules, \n\"often so voluminous, ambiguous, and contradictory, and in such flux that officials can only comply \nwith or enforce them selectively. See P. Schuck, Suing Government 66 (1983). In these circumstances, \nofficials should not err always on the side of caution. \"[O]fficials with a broad range of duties and \nauthority must often act swiftly and firmly at the risk that action deferred will be futile or constitute \nvirtual abdication of office.\"  \nId. at 196. \n*15 However, if a warden acts swiftly and does \"not err always on the side of caution,\" he may become \npersonally liable for violation of a general rule not involving the very nature of confinement which later \nis determined to have created a liberty interest. Faced with this impossible task, a \"bright line\" needs to \nbe established that liberty interests may only be created by prison rules relating to the nature of \nconfinement. This Court's prior decisions have found the existence of liberty interests only when the \nprison rule involved the duration of, or release from confinement, or that the very nature of confinement \nwas somehow dramatically altered. [FN4] Since visitation rules and other general rules of prison \nmanagement do not involve the duration of or release from confinement, no due process right would be \nimplicated in this case if such a \"bright line\" were established. \n \nFN4. E.g., Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369 (1987); Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal \nInmates, 442 U.S. 1 (1979); Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 \nU.S. 471 (1972); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973); Wolff v. McDonnell, 618 U.S. \n539 (1974). This Court's decisions have not found that rules involving day-to-day prison \noperation create liberty interests. Compare, Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238 (1983) (no \nliberty interest in interstate transfer); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215 (1976) (no liberty \ninterest in intrastate transfer). Hewitt v. Helms, supra, is perhaps the closest exception but \neven there the nature of confinement was dramatically altered. \n \n \nhttp://web2.westlaw.com/result/documenttext.aspx?docsample=False&sv=Split&service=... 5/18/2006\n\n1991 WL 11176810 Page 10of 11\nIncarceration necessarily restricts an inmate's liberty and such restrictions of liberty are within the \noverall limitations to be expected in a penal institution unless the conditions are \"cruel and unusual\" or \nunjustifiably interfere with substantive rights. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337 (1981). An inmate has \nno constitutional right to meet with any visitor of his choice. Neither do prison visitors have a \nfundamental right to visit specific inmates. Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, 433 U.S. \n119 (1977); *16Bellamy v. Bradley, 729 F.2d 416 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 469 (1984). For \ninstance, as this Court explained in Jones:  \nIn a prison context, an inmate does not retain those First Amendment rights that are \"inconsistent with \nhis status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.\" Pell v. \nProcunier, supra at 822. Prisons, it is obvious, differ in numerous respects from free society. They, to \nbegin with, are populated, involuntarily, by people who have been found to have violated one or more of \nthe criminal laws established by society for its orderly governance. In seeking a \"mutual accommodation \nbetween institutional needs and objectives [of prisons] and the provisions of the Constitution that are of \ngeneral application,\" Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S., at 556, this Court has repeatedly recognized the \nneed for major restrictions on a prisoner's rights.  \n433 U.S. at 129. \nThis necessarily expected withdrawal and limitation of an inmate's liberty and privileges has previously \ncaused this Court in Hewitt to express its concern over the expansion of liberty interests created by \nprison rules into the general areas of prison life:  \nWe have repeatedly said both that prison officials have broad administrative and discretionary authority \nover the institutions they manage and that lawfully incarcerated persons retain only a narrow range of \nprotected liberty interests. As to the first point, we have recognized that broad discretionary authority is \nnecessary because the administration of a prison is \"at best an extraordinarily difficult undertaking.\" \nWolff v. McDonnell, supra, at 566 ..., and have concluded that \"to hold ... that any substantial \ndeprivation imposed by prison authorities triggers the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause \nwould subject to judicial review a wide spectrum of discretionary actions that traditionally have been the \nbusiness of prison administrators rather than of the federal courts.\" Meachum v. Fano, supra, at 225. \n*17 .... As to the second point, our decisions have consistently refused to recognize more than the most \nbasic liberty interests in prisoners. \"Lawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or \nlimitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal \nsystem.\" Price v. Johnston, 344 US 266, 285 .... As we have held previously, these decisions require that \n\"[a]s long as the conditions or degree of confinement to which the prisoner is subjected is within the \nsentence imposed upon him and is not otherwise violative of the Constitution, the Due Process Clause \ndoes not in itself subject an inmate's treatment by prison authorities to judicial oversight.\" Montanye v. \nHaymes, 427 US 236, 242 ....  \n459 U.S. at 467-68. \nIn Hewitt, a prison regulation, regarding restrictive confinement of a prisoner who was disciplined for \nengaging in a riot causing serious injury to prison guards, was found to create a liberty interest. Even \nthen, the nature of confinement was altered. However, this Court stated there were \"persuasive reasons \nwhy we should be loath to transpose all of the reasoning in the cases just cited\" to create a liberty \ninterest in \"the situation where the statute and regulations govern the day-to-day administration of a \nprison system.\" Id. at 470. The Court was loath to do so because \"the safe and efficient operation of a \nprison on a day-to-day basis has traditionally been entrusted to the expertise of prison officials,\" and the \n\"deprivations imposed in the course of the daily operations of an institution are likely to be minor when \ncompared to the release from custody at issue in parole decisions and good time credits.\" Id. This Court \nstated that \"[t]hese facts suggest 'that regulations structuring the authority of prison administrators may \nwarrant treatment, for purposes of creation of entitlements to 'liberty,' different from statutes and \nregulations in other areas.' \" Id. (emphasis added). \n*18 The Court should now consider this important question and decide whether lawful incarceration \nwarrants the establishment of a \"bright line\" beyond which prison regulations should not create liberty \ninterests protected by the Due Process Clause unless the rules involve the duration of, release from, or \nhttp://web2.westlaw.com/result/documenttext.aspx?docsample=False&sv=Split&service=... 5/18/2006\n\n1991 WL 11176810 Page 11of 11\nthe very nature of confinement. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, a writ of certiorari should issue to review the judgment and opinion of the Sixth \nCircuit. \nAppendix not available. \nJones v.

Nickle, Knoxville,\nTenn., for plaintiffs-appellees.\nJoe R. Judkins (argued), Wartburg, Tenn., for defendants-appellants.\n[*]\nBefore MARTIN and BOGGS, Circuit Judges, and HACKETT, District Judge.\nBOYCE F. MARTIN, Jr., Circuit Judge.\nDefendants-appellants are the warden and associate warden of the Morgan County (Tennessee) Regional\nCorrectional Facility. The wardens filed this interlocutory appeal in these consolidated civil rights actions brought\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Each of the three consolidated cases has two plaintiffs, one of whom was an inmate at\nthe Morgan County prison during the relevant time period and one of whom was the inmate's spouse or fiancee\nwho visited the inmate during the relevant time period. The plaintiffs claim that their constitutional rights were\nviolated by strip and body cavity searches of the visitor plaintiffs 00 conducted without probable cause by prison\n97\nguards 00 and by the searches' effect of chilling the inmate plaintiffs' rights to visitation. On appeal, the wardens\n97\nargue that the district court erred in denying their motion for dismissal or summary judgment on the basis of their\n1113 asserted qualified immunity.[1]*1113 We affirm in part and reverse in part.\nThe wardens authorized at least two strip searches or body cavity searches of each of the visiting plaintiffs during\n1984 and 1985. Prison guards told the visiting plaintiffs that they would not be allowed to visit their husbands or\nfiances unless the visiting plaintiffs submitted to the searches. Plaintiff Mariam Long's visitation rights were\nsuspended for sixty days because she refused to undergo a manual body cavity search. None of the searches\nrevealed any contraband or any other evidence of criminal conduct.\nThe plaintiffs filed separate complaints in this now-consolidated lawsuit during December 1985. They alleged that\nthe searches violated the visiting plaintiffs' fourth amendment rights to freedom from unreasonable searches and\nseizures. The inmate plaintiffs also alleged that the wardens violated the inmate plaintiffs' fourteenth amendment\nliberty interest in visitation, created by Tennessee prison regulations. Tennessee prison regulations state that\ninmates \"shall\" have visitation rights, Tenn. Dep't. of Corrections Policy No. 501.01, V.B., and that visitation rights\nmay be suspended only for \"good cause,\" id. at No. 507.01, VI, Procedures § E(5). Tennessee prison regulations\nrequire that a prison official have probable cause to believe that a prison visitor is concealing contraband before\nthe official may authorize a strip search or a visual or manual body cavity search of the prison visitor. Id. at No.\n\n[2]\n506.06, V.B.  The plaintiffs' final allegation was that the searches violated their first amendment right to freedom\nof association.\nOn January 6, 1988, the wardens moved for dismissal or summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.\nThe wardens admitted that they authorized the searches without probable cause in violation of Tennessee prison\nregulations. The wardens averred that they had a reasonable suspicion that the plaintiffs were smuggling\ncontraband, based on confidential information from unnamed \"reliable informants.\" The wardens contended that\nby acting on their suspicion, they did not violate clearly established constitutional law. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The district court rejected this contention and\ndenied the wardens' motion to dismiss on February 15, 1989.\nAlthough appellate courts usually lack jurisdiction to hear appeals of denials of motions for summary judgment,\nthe denial of motions for summary judgment asserting qualified official immunity falls within an exception to this\ngeneral rule. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); Huron Valley Hospital v.\nCity of Pontiac, 792 F.2d 563, 566-67 (6th Cir.),cert. denied,479 U.S. 885, 107 S.Ct. 278, 93 L.Ed.2d 254 (1986)\n[3]\n.  Interlocutory appeal of the denial of summary judgment motions asserting qualified immunity is warranted\nbecause qualified immunity is not merely a defense to a law suit 00 it is an \"entitlement\" not to be sued at all. \n97\nMitchell, 472 U.S. at 525-27, 105 S.Ct. at 2814-16; Huron Valley, 792 F.2d at 567. Qualified immunity engages so\nearly because liability is not the sole public danger of law suits against public officials. The threat of liability and\n1114 necessary attention to pretrial matters, such as discovery, distract public officials from effectively *1114\nperforming their government functions and discourage able persons from entering public service. Mitchell, 472\nU.S. at 526, 105 S.Ct. at 2815; Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 816-17, 102 S.Ct. at 2737-38. Interlocutory\nappeal is appropriate because the entitlement not to be sued is \"lost forever\" if an immune public official is\nrequired to litigate the case all the way to trial. Huron Valley, 792 F.2d at 567.\nApplication of qualified immunity to a particular defendant is a question of law. Garvie v. Jackson, 845 F.2d 647,\n649 (6th Cir.1988). As such, our review is de novo. The standard for qualified immunity is that government\nofficials \"performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their\nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738. The parties do not dispute that the\nplaintiffs seek civil damages, or that the wardens' actions in approving searches based on an alleged reasonable\nsuspicion constitute \"discretionary functions\" under Harlow.\nThus, we venture once more into the labyrinth of deciding what makes a right \"clearly established\" for purposes\nof qualified immunity. In Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985), the Court held\nthat qualified immunity protected a former United States Attorney General from suit for authorizing a warrantless\nwiretap in a matter involving domestic security. Immunity applied because the unconstitutionality of warrantless\nwiretaps was not clearly established at the time of the Attorney General's wiretap authorization in November\n1970. Two years after Attorney General Mitchell's authorization of the wiretap, the Supreme Court declared such\nwiretaps unconstitutional in United States v. United States District Court, 407 U.S. 297, 92 S.Ct. 2125, 32 L.Ed.2d\n752 (1972) (holding warrantless wiretaps involving domestic threats to national security unconstitutional). In \nMitchell, the Court stated that the constitutional right prohibiting warrantless wiretaps was not clearly established\nif there remained a \"legitimate question whether an exception to the warrant requirement exists.\" 472 U.S. at 535,\n105 S.Ct. at 2820. A \"legitimate question\" obviously existed in Mitchell because at the time Attorney General\nMitchell authorized the warrantless wiretap, some district courts had approved warrantless wiretaps in cases of\ndomestic security. Id. (citing United States v. Dellinger, No. 69 CR 180 (N.D.Ill. Feb. 20, 1970),rev'd,472 F.2d\n340 (7th Cir.1972) (the \"Chicago 7\" case) and United States v. O'Neal, No. KC-CR-1204 (D.Kan. Sept. 1, 1970), \nappeal dismissed,453 F.2d 344 (10th Cir.1972)); see Dominque v. Telb, 831 F.2d 673 (6th Cir.1987) (the\nquestion in Mitchell regarding the clear establishment of a constitutional right was \"not a particularly difficult\none\"). As a result, the Court did not delve in detail into when an official would have a \"legitimate question\" as to\nthe constitutionality of his or her action. However, the Court stated that a previous case with \"identical\ncircumstances was not needed to find that a law was clearly established.\" Id.472 U.S. at 535 n. 12, 105 S.Ct. at\n2820 n. 12.\n\nIn Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3038-39, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987), the Court\nprovided more guidance on the \"legitimate question\" issue and held that in order for a constitutional right to be\nclearly established, the law must be clear in regard to the official's particular actions in the particular situation.\nThe Court stated:\nThe contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that\nwhat he is doing violates that right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified\nimmunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful; but it is to say that\nit light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\nId. at 640, 107 S.Ct. at 3039 (citations omitted). The Court in Anderson recognized that qualified immunity is not\novercome merely by general allegations that a clearly established constitutional right has been violated. Rather,\n1115 the particular conduct of *1115 the responsible official must fall clearly within the area protected by the\nconstitutional right, such that a reasonable official would know that his or her conduct violated the constitutional\nright. 483 U.S. at 640-41, 107 S.Ct. at 3039-40. It was on this ground that the Court in Anderson found that the\ncourt of appeals had erred in denying qualified immunity. Id. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039. The Court emphasized\nthat a fact-specific analysis would maintain \"the balance that our cases strike between the interests in vindication\nof citizens' constitutional rights and in public officials' effective performance of their duties.\" Id. at 639, 107 S.Ct.\nat 3039. The Court sought to avoid \"making it impossible for officials `reasonably [to] anticipate when their\nconduct may give rise to liability for damages.'\" Id. (quoting Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 195, 104 S.Ct. 3012,\n3019, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984)).\nWe use an \"objective reasonableness\" standard to determine whether an official could reasonably anticipate that\na constitutional right is clearly established. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738; Masters v.\nCrouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1251 (6th Cir.) (Lively, J.), cert. denied sub nom. Frey v. Masters, ___ U.S. ___, 110\nS.Ct. 503, 107 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989). As applied in Anderson v. Creighton, the objective reasonableness test\nfocuses on whether an official, given the facts that the official knew or reasonably should have known about the\nsituation, should have known that his or her particular conduct would not pass scrutiny when applied to the law. \n483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3040; Wood v. Ostrander, 851 F.2d 1212, 1218 (9th Cir.1988) (\"The immunity\nstandard considers whether a reasonable [official] should view the [previous case law] as controlling.\"). Public\nofficials are expected to be aware of the state of clearly established law governing their conduct. The Eighth\nCircuit has stated that \"state employees may not rely on their ignorance of even the most esoteric aspects of the\nlaw to deny individuals their due process rights.\" Wentz v. Klecker, 721 F.2d 244 (8th Cir.1983). In determining\nwhether a constitutional right is clearly established in a given situation, we \"look first to the decisions of the\nSupreme Court, then to decisions of this court and other courts within this circuit, and finally to decisions of other\ncircuits.\" Crouch, 872 F.2d at 1251-52 (citations omitted). With these general official immunity principles in mind,\nwe turn to the specific allegations of unconstitutional activity in this case.\nI. Search and Seizure Rights\nPlaintiffs allege that qualified immunity does not apply because the wardens violated the prison visitors' clearly\nestablished fourth amendment right to be free from strip and body cavity searches absent probable cause. To\nshow the existence of a clearly established fourth amendment right, plaintiffs rely on precedents of other circuits\nand Tennessee prison regulations requiring probable cause for a strip search of a prison visitor. We note that\nalthough Tennessee prison regulations may create a constitutional entitlement under the due process clause of\nthe fourteenth amendment, they cannot change the standard of analysis for constitutional issues arising under\nthe fourth amendment.\nWe need not define in this case precisely what level of individualized suspicion is required in the context of prison\nvisitor searches. The question before the court is not whether the proper standard should be reasonable\nsuspicion or should rise to the level of probable cause, but whether a constitutional right to be free from strip and\nbody cavity search absent probable clause was clearly established at the time of the searches for purposes of\nqualified immunity. We hold that such a right was not established.\n\nIn the Sixth Cicuit, we have not stated what level of fourth amendment protection is clearly established in the\ncontext of prison visitor searches. In Ohio Civil Service Employees Ass'n. v. Seiter, 858 F.2d 1171, 1177 (6th\nCir.1988), the Court held that the level of protection against strip and body searches afforded to prison\nemployees was not clearly established. In dicta, the Court discussed the precedents from other circuits holding\n1116 that strip searches of prison *1116 visitors without a \"reasonable suspicion\" could violate the fourth amendment. \nSee, e.g., Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 674 (8th Cir.1982); Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556 (1st Cir.1985); \nThorne v. Jones, 765 F.2d 1270 (5th Cir.1985),cert. denied,475 U.S. 1016, 106 S.Ct. 1198, 1199, 89 L.Ed.2d\n313 (1986). The Seiter Court distinguished the reasoning for cases involving searches of prison visitors from\ncases, like the one before it, involving strip searches of prison employees. 858 F.2d at 1176-77. The Court held\nthat the state had a higher interest in searching prison employees than in searching prison visitors. Id. at 1177.\nThe Court noted that prison employees had access to more sensitive areas of the prison than did visitors and that\nprison employees spent more time in the prison than did visitors. Id. In addition, the Court stated that prison\nemployees had less of a privacy interest than did prison visitors because the employees had volunteered to work\nin a security environment. Id.\nUnlike searches of prison employees, searches of prison visitors during 1984 and 1985 without at least a\nreasonable suspicion violated clearly established law, because a reasonable officer should have known that such\nsearches would be found unconstitutional. As noted by the court in Seiter, while prison visitors volunteer to visit\nthe prison, they probably do not choose to incarcerate their friends or family members. Id. The prison visitors'\nsituation is analogous to that of air travellers going through airport security. Although they volunteer to board the\nairplane, they do not lose their right not to be subjected to something so invasive as a strip or body cavity search\nwithout so much as a hint of suspicion. See Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 674 (8th Cir.1982) (strip searches are\ninevitably \"embarrassing and humiliating\"). However, the plaintiffs have not alleged that this clearly established\nfourth amendment right was violated. The plaintiffs have alleged only that the wardens lacked probable cause for\ntheir searches, not that the wardens lacked reasonable suspicion. The asserted right of prison visitors to be free\nfrom strip and body cavity searches without probable cause was not clearly established under the fourth\namendment. Consequently, the plaintiffs have failed to plead a cause of action under the fourth amendment that\ncan ovecome the wardens' assertion of qualified immunity.\nII. Liberty Interest\nTennessee prison regulations give inmates liberty interest in prison visitation under the fourteenth amendment to\nthe federal Constitution, which the wardens have clearly violated according to plaintiffs' allegations. As we have\nstated, \"The Supreme Court has determined that violation of a clearly established state regulation is sufficient to\ncause officials to forfeit their qualified immunity\" for claims of deprivation of federal constitutional guarantees. \nSpruytte v. Walters, 753 F.2d 498, 510 (6th Cir.1985),cert. denied,474 U.S. 1054, 106 S.Ct. 788, 88 L.Ed.2d 767\n(1986); see Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984). In Spruytte, we found that a\nstate regulation, which allowed inmates to receive books that did not threaten security, created a constitutionally\nprotected property or liberty interest. Because the state regulation was clearly established, the panel in Spruytte\nheld that prison officials were not entitled to qualified immunity where they refused to allow an inmate to receive a\npaperback dictionary from his mother.\nEven before Spruytte, we recognized that other Tennessee prison regulations created liberty entitlements for\ninmates under the fourteenth amendment to the federal Constitution. Bills v. Henderson, 631 F.2d 1287, 1294\n(6th Cir.1980). In Bills, Tennessee prison inmates challenged prison officials' use of administrative segregation in\nviolation of Tennessee prison regulations. We held that a state prison policy statement created a federal\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest if it limited the discretion of prison officials. Id. at 1293-94. We also found\n1117 that official discretion was limited enough to create a protected liberty interest by regulations, which merely *1117\nstated the purposes of administrative segregation. Id. at 1294.\nIn Kentucky Dep't. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989), the Court\nheld that state prison regulations must be couched in mandatory language in order to establish a liberty interest\nwith federal constitutional due process protection. The Court held that the Kentucky regulations at issue in \n\nThompson were not sufficiently mandatory to invoke a property interest. The Kentucky regulations merely stated,\n\"It is the policy of the Kentucky state reformatory to respect the right of inmates to have visits in the spirit of the\ncourt decisions and the consent decree, while ensuring the safety and security of the institution.\" In stark\ncontrast, the Tennessee prison regulations clearly state in mandatory terms that a strip search can not take place\nwithout probable cause. Tenn. Dep't. of Correction Policy No. 506.06, V.B. The same regulations explicitly define\nprobable cause as \"more than mere suspicion.\" Id. at No. 506.06, IV.I.\nTennessee prison regulations establish the inmates' fourteenth amendment liberty interest in visitation under the\nreasoning in both Bills, 631 F.2d 1287, and the later, stricter requirements of Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 109 S.Ct.\n[4]\n1904.  The Tennessee prison regulations state that inmates \"shall\" have visitation rights and that visits \"shall be\nlimited only by the institution's space and personnel resources.\" Id. at No. 507.01, V.B. The Tennessee prison\nregulations require the warden to establish a visitation schedule \"which includes at least the hours of one evening\n[5]\nper week, Saturdays, Sundays and state holidays.\" Tenn. Dep't. of Corrections Policy No. 507.01, VI.C.  In\naddition, the Tennessee regulations allow visitation rights to be suspended only upon a showing of \"good cause.\"\nTenn. Dep't. of Corrections Policy No. 507.01, VI, Procedures, § E(5); cf. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455\nU.S. 422, 430, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 1155, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982) (\"The hallmark of property, ... is an individual\nentitlement grounded in state law, which cannot be removed except `for cause'\"). Because the plaintiffs' visitation\nrights were mandatory and could not be removed without good cause under the Tennessee prison regulations,\nthey were liberty entitlements under the fourteenth amendment. Threats to remove this visitation right, in\nretaliation for the visitors' refusal to submit to an illegal strip search, violated clearly established law. Thus,\nqualified immunity does not bar plaintiffs' action for this alleged constitutional deprivation.\nThe wardens rely on Washington v. Starke, 855 F.2d 346 (6th Cir.1988), to argue that an intra-departmental\nregulation cannot provide a basis for denying qualified immunity. This argument misconstrues Starke. Starke\nconcerned a single police department, as opposed to a state-wide prison system. Thus, Starke does not alter\neither the Supreme Court's decision in Thompson or our decisions in Bills and Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248\n(6th Cir.1989).\nOnce a constitutional liberty interest is clearly established, prison officials may violate that interest only if they\nmeet the fundamental requirements of due process 00 notice and an opportunity to be heard. See, e.g., Wolff v.\n97\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2975, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Plaintiffs have alleged that they were\n1118 not afforded any process at all. The district court properly denied the *1118 wardens' claim of qualified immunity\nin regard to the plaintiffs' claims of deprivation of liberty without due process under the fourteenth amendment.\nIII. Freedom of Association Rights\nThe district court also held that plaintiffs' first amendment rights of free association were violated by the wardens'\nrefusal, without probable cause, to allow visiting plaintiffs to visit the inmate plaintiffs unless the visitors submitted\nto a strip or body cavity search. A prison inmate \"retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent\nwith his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.\" Pell v.\nProcunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974). Although the complaints are not clear\nand the briefs do not address this issue, plaintiffs apparently allege that the searches violated the plaintiffs'\nfreedom of association by discouraging visits to the inmates. Plaintiffs do not allege any intent to discourage\nassociation, either for its own sake or as retaliation for any actions by the inmates in prison. In the Sixth Circuit,\nwe have not decided the degree to which prison inmates retain their freedom of association. The Fifth Circuit has\nheld that prison inmates have no first amendment right \"to simple physical association.\" Thorne v. Jones, 765\nF.2d 1270, 1274 (5th Cir.1985). Given the sparse authority on this issue, we hold that any such right, if it exists, is\nnot clearly established. Consequently, we reverse the district court's ruling on this issue.\nFor the above stated reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court insofar as we find that qualified\nimmunity should be granted to the wardens in regard to the plaintiffs' claims under the fourth and first\namendments, and we affirm the district court's judgment denying the wardens' qualified immunity against claims\nalleging violations of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.\n\nBOGGS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nIf we are to deny qualified immunity to these prison officials based on their violation, not of the Constitution\ndirectly, but of state administrative regulations, we must find that, in 1985, all reasonable prison officials would\nhave known that they could be personally liable for money damages if they violated a prison regulation of their\nown state. McIntosh v. Weinberger, 810 F.2d 1411, 1433 n. 9 (8th Cir.1987); Dominique v. Telb, 831 F.2d 673,\n676 (6th Cir.1987).\nI do not think that the state of the case law permits that conclusion. The best case for that proposition is Davis v.\nScherer, 468 U.S. 183, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984). Although that case is not a model of clarity,\nfootnote 12 (468 U.S. at 194, 104 S.Ct. at 3019) while clearly discounting mere violation of a regulation as the\nbasis for any kind of liability, seems to say that a section 1983 suit sometimes can be based on a violation of a\nregulation that furnishes the gravamen of the action sued on, though at other times it speaks of liability \"only to\nthe extent that there is a clear violation of the statutory rights....\" (emphasis added). Although the violation of the\nregulation led directly to and authorized the strip search that is the injury complained of, I do not think all\nreasonable officials would understand from Davis that they were now liable in damages for every violation of\nregulations. Similarly, Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), which holds that a\nprison regulation can be the basis for a liberty interest protected by section 1983, was not a money damages\ncase and does not allude to that possibility.\nI therefore respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion that refuses to allow qualified immunity from suit\nbased on violation of the prison regulation.\n[*] The Honorable Barbara K. Hackett, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] The wardens also sought review of the district court's grant of plaintiffs' motions to compel discovery and for\nattorney's fees resulting from the wardens' failure to cooperate with discovery. We dismissed these issues under\n28 U.S.C. § 1292 as unappealable without a final decision in an order entered on October 12, 1989.\n[2] This policy states in full: \nStrip, visual body cavity and/or manual body cavity searches of the persons of visitors and employees may only\nbe conducted when they are specifically authorized regarding a particular person and shall only be authorized\nwhen there is probable cause to believe the person is concealing contraband.\nTenn. Dep't. of Corrections Policy No. 506.06. V.B. (emphasis added).\n[3] Although Mitchell was a constitutional tort action against a federal official, a suit against a state official under\nsection 1983 is treated the same for purposes of qualified immunity. Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 500-01, 98\nS.Ct. 2894, 2907-08, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978).\n[4] Although Thompson was not decided until 1989, applying it here does not violate the rule that public officials\nare accountable only for laws that were clearly established at the time of their actions. Washington v. Starke, 855\nF.2d 346, 348 (6th Cir.1988). The Court's decision in Thompson reflected the state of clearly established law in\n1985 00 the time of the visitation in that case. The searches in this case occurred during that same period. Thus, \n97\nThompson is good precedent concerning the state of the fourteenth amendment during the relevant time in this\ncase. In any event, if Thompson did not apply, we would analyze this issue under the less stringent requirements\nset forth in Bills.\n[5] The imprecise language regarding the visitation schedule presumably allows inmates to have one visitation\nnight during the normal workweek and additional visitation on weekends and state holidays.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
