    "summary": "<p>On April 25, 2000, three named plaintiffs in Louisiana and Kentucky filed this class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court the Eastern District of Louisiana. Represented by private council, they sued the Orlean's Parish Criminal Sheriff's Office (OPCSO), challenging the strip and visual body cavity search policy of the Orleans Parish Jail in Louisiana.  The plaintiffs, who were arrested for minor offenses, alleged that they were strip searched pursuant to a blanket policy of OPCSO.  The policy required all pretrial detainees entering the jail to be strip searched, even if the police lacked reasonable suspicion to believe the detainees were concealing weapons or contraband.  The plaintiffs alleged that the policy violated the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and sought monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs moved for class certification on the injunctive and damages claims.</p><p>The parties consented to Magistrate Judge Alma Chasez hearing the case.  </p><p>Initial discovery proceeded and, on January 14, 2002, the District Court (Judge Chasez) entered a Consent Decree agreed upon by the parties as to the injunctive claims.  Under the Decree, the Sheriff agreed to end the challenged blanket strip search policy and issued a new policy, which allowed for the strip search of new arrestees charged with minor offenses only when reasonable suspicion existed to believe the arrestee possessed weapons or contraband.  Prior to initiating the strip search under the new policy, deputies were required to fill out an agreed-upon form (Arrestee Strip Search Log) and obtain a supervisor's approval.  An injunctive class of people arrested for minor offenses and detained pending the posting of bond who were strip-searched in facilities operated by OPCSO was certified pursuant to the Consent Decree.  A Supplemental Consent Decree was entered on May 16, 2002, under which the Sheriff agreed to install \"changing booths\" for men and women so that they could change their clothes in privacy when ordered to do so.</p><p>The decree stated that monitoring would proceed for one year following the implementation of the agreement. </p><p>Litigation of the case continued on the damage claims.  Per the agreement of the parties, Magistrate Judge Chasez certified the case as a class action for people arrested only on minor offenses, confined in any facility of OPCSO and required to submit to the strip searches prior to his or her first court appearance resulting in exposure of the arrestee’s genital area, anus, buttocks, and/or breasts. The certification was for liability purposes only and granted on January 3, 2003.  While trial preparation continued, the parties began settlement discussions, which continued in an on-again/off-again fashion for years until a proposed Settlement Agreement was reached.  Under the Agreement, the Sheriff agreed to pay $9.375 million, plus interest earned since June 2, 2004, to settle all class damage claims.   The settlement class members included every person arrested only on \"minor offenses\" who entered the Intake and Processing Center operated by the Sheriff and who fit into one of 3 subclasses:</p><p><blockquote>Sub-Class A: Those subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches in the presence of deputies and/or other prisoners from April 25, 1999 through February 14, 2002.</p><p>Sub-Class B: Those subjected to strip searches when being ordered to change into jail clothes in the presence of deputies and/or other prisoners from February 15, 2002 through May 31, 2002. </p><p>Sub-Class C: Those subjected to strip searches when ordered to take off jail garments, in the presence of deputies and/or other prisoners, while being admitted to Templeman III from the Intake Center from June 1, 2002 through May 31, 2003.</blockquote> Payments to individual class members would be calculated on a point system: 3 points for Sub-Class A, 1 point for Sub-Class B, and 1.5 points for Sub-Class C.   Class representatives received incentive awards ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, based on their involvement and participation.  Class counsel were to request an award of attorneys' fees in the amount of 35% of the settlement fund, plus expenses. </p><p>Judge Chasez preliminarily approved the settlement on January 11, 2007 and held a fairness hearing on September 13, 2007.  The final judgment approving the settlement was filed on July 17, 2008. </p><p>Over the next several years, the parties worked together to distribute the funds to the class. By 2017, there was still unclaimed money remaining in the fund, and the parties moved to have it deposited in the Court's Registry as a Cy Pres Fund, to later be used for the next best purpose.  The court approved the motion on July 31, 2017 and ordered the remaining settlement funds to be put in custody of the Orleans Parish Sheriff to be disbursed upon further order of the court. The court also ordered appointed claims administrators to prepare a final report documenting the state of all unclaimed property funds made to authorized claimants by July 17, 2017. </p><p>On February 6, 2018, $2,793.28 was transferred to the Center for Educational Excellence in Alternative Settings (CEEAS) to be used to support enrichment classes through the Travis Hill School at the Orleans Justice Center.</p><p>After the settlement money was disbursed, an unrepresented individual class member displeased with the settlement appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on April 5, 2018. On June 22, 2018, Judge Clement, Elrod and Higginson dismissed the appeal because it was filed too late. The case is now closed.</p><p></p>",

SECTION: \"A\"(5)\nORDER AND REASONS\nPresently before the Court is the motion by class counsel for\nfinal  approval of class action settlement and application for\nattorneys fees and costs.  (Rec. doc. 174).  Also before the Court\nis  plaintiffs’  motion for incentive awards for class\nrepresentatives.  (Rec. doc. 174, 175). In connection therewith the\nCourt received arguments at the fairness hearing held on September\n13, 2007 which have been considered.  (Rec. doc. 172). The Court\nhas  also reviewed the written  memoranda  and supporting\ndocumentation  submitted by all parties, including numerous\naffidavits  and declarations submitted by counsel and class\nadministrators.  Lastly, the Court has examined the procedural\nrecord  and applied its own knowledge of the case accumulated\n\nthrough  is active involvement in this litigation since its\ninception.  For the following reasons, plaintiffs’ motions for\nfinal  approval of class action settlement, application for\nincentive awards and application for attorneys’ fees and costs are\nGRANTED because the Court finds that the proposed settlement of\nthis  action is fair, reasonable and adequate and that the\nattorneys’ fees sought have well been earned.\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn April 25, 2000, an initial complaint was filed herein by\nplaintiffs,  Greta Cazenave 1/,  Janet Densmore 2/,  Jeff Brite and\nWilliam  Brice White III. (Rec. doc. 1).  Additional class\nrepresentatives were added through an unopposed motion filed on\nNovember 24, 2003.  (Rec. doc. 102).\nOn July 25, 2000, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class\nherein. (Rec. doc. 5).  In that document, plaintiffs alleged that\ndefendants had a policy, practice and/or custom whereby arrestees\ncharged with minor offenses and detained pending the posting of\nbond were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity\n1/ Greta Casenave withdrew as a class plaintiff per motion\nfiled on December 15, 2003. (Rec. doc. 104).  She opted out of the\nclass action on May 14, 2004. (Rec. doc. 120).\n2/ Janet Densmore subsequently withdrew as a plaintiff and\nclass  representative in this matter, preserving her rights to\nproceed in another litigation. (Rec. doc. 3).\n2\n\nsearches without reasonable suspicion that such persons were hiding\nweapons or contraband.  The motion further alleged that, despite\nthe ruling in Kelly v. Foti, 77 F.3d 819 (5th Cir.), reh’g en banc\ndenied, 85 F.3d 627 (5 th Cir. 1996), no change in the policy or\npractice had been implemented by defendants.  \nPlaintiffs sought certification of a class pursuant to Rule 23\n(a) and (b)(3), Fed. R. Civ. P., which they defined as follows:\nall persons arrested for minor offenses and detained pending\nthe posting of bond who were strip searched in facilities\noperated  by the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff’s Office\npursuant  to defendants’ policy, practice and/or custom\nrequiring that these searches be conducted without reasonable,\nparticularized suspicion that the arrestee is hiding weapons\nor contraband.\nIn that motion, plaintiffs went on to argue that every federal\ncircuit court of appeals having occasion to rule on this issue,\nincluding the First, Second, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth\nand  Tenth Circuits, had held in accordance with the rationale\nexpressed in Kelly, supra.\nIssue was joined on July 28, 2000 when defendants filed an\nanswer to plaintiffs’ amended complaint. (Rec. doc 9).  On August\n28, 2000, a consent to proceed before the undersigned, pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. §636(c), was entered into the record. (Rec. doc. 12).\nThereafter, the Court held a status conference on the motion\nfor class certification, established a discovery schedule on the\nmotion and set forth a briefing schedule for the parties.  (Rec.\n3\n\ndoc. 10).  A hearing date of November 8, 2000 was established on\nthe class certification motion. (Id.).  \nThe  first motion for contempt and sanctions filed by\nplaintiffs for failure to provide discovery was set for hearing on\nOctober 4, 2000. (Rec. doc. 17).  Defendants were ordered, with\nspecifics, to comply with plaintiffs motion. (Rec. doc. 21).\nAt a status conference held on October 25, 2000, the parties\njointly agreed that the class certification hearing could not go\nforward in November, 2000 as previously established.  (Rec. doc.\n27). That date was vacated and a further status conference was\nscheduled for December 5, 2000.  (Id .).  In the interim, counsel\nwere ordered to work on a proposed change of policy dealing with\nstrip searches in the jail. (Id.). \nAt the status conference held on December 5, 2000, a proposed\npolicy change was discussed with the Court which, if acceptable to\nthe Sheriff, would moot the issue of affirmative injunctive relief\nin this litigation.  (Rec. doc. 29).  Counsel for the Sheriff was\nordered to advise the Court and all parties, on or before December\n12, 2000, whether the Sheriff would implement the policy discussed.\n(Id.).  The Court further noted that the parties were in complete\ndisagreement  as  to  whether a damage class could be certified\nherein.  Briefing on this issue was ordered by the Court. (Id.). \nOn March 20, 2001, the Court re-set the hearing on plaintiffs’\n4\n\nmotion to certify class for April 4, 2001. (Rec. doc. 37).  Joint\nstipulations were entered for purposes of class certification on\nMarch 23, 2001. (Rec. doc. 36).  Supplemental briefing on this\nissue was scheduled by the Court.  (Rec. doc. 37).  Those dates\nwere  subsequently extended on an unopposed motion from the\ndefendants. (Rec. doc. 40).\nPlaintiffs  sought leave to propound additional discovery\npertaining to class certification on May 24, 2001. (Rec. doc. 42).\nThat motion was granted. (Rec. doc. 44).  The parties were further\nadvised that, since the issue of injunctive relief still had not\nbeen amicably resolved, the Court would address that issue on June\n22, 2001. (Id.). \nFollowing additional status conferences with the parties, a\nconsent decree for injunctive and declaratory relief was entered by\nthe Court on January 15, 2002. (Rec. doc. 54).  The decree was to\nbe implemented within 30 days of its entry.  (Id.). Monitoring for\na period of one year was also provided for in the consent decree.\n(Id.). \nAt a status conference held on February 28, 2002, plaintiffs\nalleged a violation of the newly entered consent decree which the\nCourt could not resolve in the conference format.  (Rec. doc. 57).\nPlaintiffs’  counsel were instructed to file a specific motion\ndealing with the issue. (Id.).  That motion was filed and a hearing\n5\n\nwas scheduled for May 15, 2002. (Rec. docs. 59, 60).  A joint\nsupplemental consent decree was entered on this issue, referred to\nas the “Change-Out” Procedure, on May 20, 2002.  (Rec. doc. 62).\nIn August, 2002, plaintiffs sought class certification for\nliability purposes only pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4), Fed. R. Civ. P.\n(Rec. doc. 65).  That motion was opposed by the defense. (Rec. Doc.\n69).  However, by September 19, 2002, the parties had come to an\nagreement on this issue, for liability purposes, to certify two\nclasses of individuals.  The Court ordered the parties to make a\njoint submission to specifically define those two classes. (Rec.\ndoc. 70).\nPer judgment of January 3, 2003, a class of individuals, for\nliability purposes only, was certified by the Court as follows:\nEvery person arrested only on “minor offenses” (as defined\nbelow) and thereafter confined in any facility of the Orleans\nParish Criminal Sheriff’s Office (OPCSO) who, on or after\nApril 25, 1999, was required to  submit to either or both of\nthe following procedures, prior to his or her first court\nappearance, pursuant to a blanket policy, practice or custom\nof the OPCSO and applicable to all arrestees to be admitted to\ngeneral population of the jail:\n(A)  The removal or rearrangement of some or all of the\narrestee’s clothing, including undergarments, in the presence\nof OPCSO deputies and/or other detainees, resulting in the\nexposure  of the arrestee’s genital area, anus, buttocks,\nand/or  breasts (in the case of female arrestees) and the\nsubsequent visual inspection of the arrestee by OPCSO deputy\nor deputies; and/or\n(B)  The removal or rearrangement of some or all of the\narrestee’s  clothing, including undergarments, in order to\n6\n\nchange into OPCSO supplied garments under circumstances which\nallowed OPCSO deputies and/or other detainees the ability to\nview his or her genital area, anus, buttocks and/or (in the\ncase of female arrestees) breasts.\nAs used herein ”minor offenses” includes one or more traffic\noffenses,  misdemeanors, petty offenses, or violations of\nmunicipal or parish ordinances, none of which involves weapons\nor controlled dangerous substances.\nAs  used herein “visual  inspection  by an OPCSO deputy or\ndeputies” includes inspection of the arrestees’ genitalia,\nbuttocks, anal cavity, vaginal cavity and/or female breasts.\n(Rec. doc. 71).\nPlaintiffs’ counsel thereafter filed a motion to extend the\nmonitoring period and to extend the time for filing a request for\nattorneys’  fees  and  costs.  (Rec. doc. 72).  That motion was\ngranted on January 21, 2003.  (Rec. doc. 74).\nA further status conference was convened on February 25, 2003\nto establish a protocol for proceeding with the remaining portions\nof this case.  (Rec. doc. 76).  At that time counsel were ordered\nto formulate a case management order for submission to the Court on\nor before April 15, 2003.  (Rec. doc. 76).  On April 22, 2003, the\nparties furnished the Court with a joint stipulation of findings of\nfact pertaining to those individuals in Sub-class A defined above.\n(Rec. doc. 77).  More than 67,000 individuals were identified as\nbeing part of this group. (Id.). \nA joint proposed case management plan was furnished to the\nCourt on April 22, 2003. (Rec. doc. 78).  At a status conference\n7\n\nheld on May 15, 2003, counsel were ordered to file a motion for\nsummary judgment on the issue of liability pertaining to the claims\nof those individuals identified as members of Sub-Class A, also\nknown as the “Kelly Class”.  (Rec. doc. 80).  That motion was filed\non June 6, 2003 and oral argument was set on the motion for August\n27, 2003. (Rec. docs. 81, 82)\nOn June 26, 2003 a second motion for contempt and sanctions\nwas  filed by plaintiffs for violation of the consent decrees\nentered on January 15, 2002 and May 20, 2002.  (Rec. doc. 84).  On\nthat same date, the Court signed an unopposed motion extending the\nmonitoring period in connection with the Court’s prior orders.\n(Rec. doc. 86).\nOn  June 27, 2003, plaintiffs’ counsel filed a motion for\npartial summary judgment on the issue of liability as to Sub-class\nB individuals which was set for hearing on August 27, 2003. (Rec.\ndoc. 85).  The Court set oral argument on the plaintiffs’ motion\nfor contempt and sanctions for the same date. (Rec. doc. 87).\nPlaintiffs subsequently requested an evidentiary hearing on the\nmotion  for contempt and sanctions which the Court granted and\nscheduled for August 27, 2003.  (Rec. doc. 93).\nOn August 21, 2003, a status conference was conducted with the\nparties at which time avenues pertaining to settlement of this\nmatter were discussed.  (Rec. doc. 97).  The Court also ordered the\n8\n\nparties to advise in  writing by August 27 th whether the pending\nmotions for summary judgment and contempt could be moved to a\ndifferent date and time.  (Id.). \nOn  September 5, 2003, a further status conference was\nconducted with counsel. (Rec. doc. 98). A resolution of the motion\nfor contempt had been worked out by counsel, with which the Court\nwas able to concur.  That resolution was memorialized in a letter\nwhich the Court attached to its minute entry.  (I.d).  At that time\nthe parties presented the Court with a stipulated amendment to the\nclass  definition which the Court approved and which reads as\nfollows:\nEvery person arrested only on “minor offenses” (as defined\nbelow) and thereafter confined in any facility of the Orleans\nParish Criminal Sheriff’s office (OPCSO), who, on or after\nApril 25, 1999, was required to submit to any or all of the\nfollowing  procedures, prior to his or her first court\nappearance, pursuant to a blanket policy, practice or custom\nof the OPCSO and applicable to all arrestees to be admitted to\ngeneral population of the jail:\n(A)  The removal or rearrangement of some or all of the\narrestee’s clothing, including undergarments, in the presence\nof OPCSO deputies and/or other detainees, resulting in the\nexposure  of the arrestee’s genital area, anus, buttocks,\nand/or  breasts (in the case of female arrestees) and the\nsubsequent visual inspection of the arrestee by OPCSO deputy\nor deputies; and/or\n(B)  The removal or rearrangment of some or all of the\narrestee’s  clothing, including undergarments, in order to\nchange into OPCSO supplied garments under circumstances which\nallowed OPCSO deputies and/or other detainees the ability to\nview his or her genital area, anus, buttocks and/or (in the\ncase of female arrestees) breasts; and/or\n9\n\n(C)  The removal or rearrangement of some or all of the\narrestee’s clothing or clothing furnished by OPCSO, including\nundergarments, in the presence of OPCSO deputies and/or other\ndetainees, which resulted in the exposure of the arrestee’s\ngenital area, anus, buttocks and/or breasts (in the case of\nfemale arrestees) to others in violation of the orders of this\nCourt of January 15, 2002 or May 20, 2002.\nAs used herein “minor offense” includes one or more traffic\noffenses,  misdemeanors, petty offenses, or violations of\nmunicipal or parish ordinances, none of which involves weapons\nor controlled dangerous substances.\nAs  used herein “visual inspection by an OPCSO deputy or\ndeputies” includes inspection of the arrestee’s genitalia,\nbuttocks, anal cavity, vaginal cavity and/or female breasts.\n(Id. at pp.14-15).\nThe  Court encouraged the parties to begin working toward\nsettlement of the remaining issues in the  case.  (Rec. doc. 99).\nHowever, shortly thereafter, a further motion for contempt and\nsanctions for violation of this Court’s order of September 5, 2003\nwas filed by plaintiffs.  (Rec. doc. 100).\nA  status conference was conducted on November 13, 2003;\ncounsel were ordered to research the issue of whether a damage\nclass could be certified which contained a non-opt out provision.\n(Rec. doc. 101).  It was further ordered that plaintiffs’ motion\nfor contempt would be heard on November 26th.  (Id.). That date was\nsubsequently continued.  (Rec. doc. 109).\nOn January 16, 2004, defendants filed a motion to certify a\nclass or subclasses under Rule 23(b)(1)(B), Fed. R. Civ. P., which\n10\n\nwas scheduled for hearing on March 1, 2004. (Rec. doc. 107).  On\nMarch 29, 2004, the parties filed a joint motion (Rec. doc. 112)\nwithdrawing the following motions without prejudice in order to\npursue settlement: 1) plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on\nissues of liability only for Sub-Class A (“Kell yClass”) (Rec. doc.\n81); 2) plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on issue of\nliability  only for Sub-class B (Rec. doc. 85); 3) plaintiffs’\nmotion for notice to class members (Rec. doc. 91); 4) plaintiffs’\nmotion for contempt (Rec. doc. 100); and 5) defendants’ motion to\ncertify a class or sub-classes under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(B)\n(Rec. doc. 107).  The Court appointed Mr. Roger Larue of Mediation\nArbitration Professional Systems, Inc. to attempt to settle these\nclaims.  (Rec. doc. 118).\nFollowing that mediation, the Court ordered the parties to\nfurnish a term sheet pertaining to their preliminary agreement of\nsettlement and an escrow agreement allowing for the deposit of\nsettlement  funds.  (Rec. docs. 122, 123). A proposed public\nannouncement for publication  to class members was also to be\nfurnished  by September 30, 2004. (Id .).   A joint motion for\npreliminary approval of the class action settlement pursuant to\nRule 23(b)(1)(B) was submitted to the Court.  (Rec. doc. 126).  At\na status conference on May 10, 2005, the defense was to indicate\nwhether it would agree to amend the proposed settlement to allow\n11\n\nfor the settlement to go forward under Rule 23(b)(2) rather than\nRule 23(b)(1)(B).  An evidentiary hearing was scheduled for August\n29, 2005.  (Rec. doc. 130). Due to ongoing negotiations among the\nparties that hearing date was vacated on August 16, 2005. (Rec.\ndoc. 138).\nUltimately, on January 11, 2007, a motion was presented to the\nCourt  for preliminary approval of the class action settlement\nagreement, which was granted by the Court. (Rec. doc. 154).  That\ndocument reaffirmed the previous certification of the class and\nsub-classes set forth above under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) for\ninjunctive relief and found that institutional reform had been\naccomplished.   The order further found that monetary relief\npursuant  to Rule 23(b)(3) was fair and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\nThe ultimate class was defined as follows:\nEvery person arrested only on “minor offenses” (as defined\nbelow) who entered the Intake and Processing Center (“IPC”)\noperated  by the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriffs Office\n(“OPCSO”),during the time periods set forth below, who was\nrequired to submit to any or all of the following procedures,\nprior  to his or her first court appearance or release,\nwhichever came first, pursuant to a blanket policy, practice\nor custom of the OPCSO applicable to all arrestees to be\nadmitted to the general population of the jail:\nSub-Class “A” (Or the “Kelly” class):\n(A)  the removal or rearrangement of some or all of the\narrestee’s clothing, including undergarments, in the presence\nof OPCSO deputies and/or other detainees, resulting in the\n12\n\nexposure  of the arrestee’s genital area, anus, buttocks,\nand/or breasts (in the case of arrestee’s genital area, anus,\nbuttocks and/or breasts (in the case of female arrestees) and\nthe subsequent visual inspection of the arrestee’s private\nparts by OPCSO deputy or deputies, which occurred from April\n25, 1999 through February 14, 2002;\nSub-Class “B” (or the “Change-Out” class):\n(B)  The removal or rearrangement of some or all of the\narrestee’s  clothing, including undergarments, in order to\nchange into OPCSO supplied garments under circumstances which\nallowed OPCSO deputies and/or other detainees the ability to\nview his or her genital area, anus, buttocks and/or (in the\ncase  of female arrestees) breasts, which occurred from\nFebruary 15, 2002 through May 31, 2002;\nSub-Class “C” (or the “Contempt” or “Templeman III” class):\n(C) the removal or rearrangement of some or all of a male\narrestee’s clothing or clothing furnished by OPCSO including\nundergarments, in the presence of OPCSO deputies and/or other\ndetainees, which resulted in the exposure of the arrestee’s\ngenital area, anus, and/or buttocks to others in violation of\nthe Court’s Order of May 20, 2002 as the arrestee was being\nadmitted to the receiving tier at Templeman III from the IPC,\nwhich occurred from June 1, 2002 through May 331, 2003.\nAs used herein “minor offense” includes one or more traffic\noffenses,  misdemeanors, petty offenses, or violations of\nmunicipal or parish ordinances, none of which involves weapons\nor  controlled dangerous substances.  This definition\nspecifically excludes any and all felonies.\nAs used herein the arrestee’s private parts means inspection\nof the arrestees’ genitalia, buttocks, anal cavity, vaginal\ncavity and/or female breasts buy an OPCSO deputy or deputies.\n(Rec. doc. 154, pp. 4-6).\nThe Court found that the current plaintiffs were adequate\nclass  representatives and that class counsel had properly\nrepresented the class.  The Court approved the form of notice to\n13\n\nclass members and further approved Analytics, Inc. to be the claims\nadministrator.  A date to begin dissemination of the notice was\nestablished  as was a date for a Fairness Hearing, which went\nforward on September 13, 2007. (Id .).  At the Fairness Hearing,\ndefendants  waived their right to opt out of the settlement\npresently before the Court.\nNOTICE\nThe Court appointed Analytics, Inc., hereinafter referred to\nas Analytics, to identify potential class members, mail a class\nnotice and proof of claim and release to those individuals and to\npublish summary notice of this matter.  Per affidavit of Richard W.\nSimmons, President of Analytics, dated September 12, 2007, which\nwas provided to the Court at the Fairness Hearing, being identified\nas Exhibit B annexed to the Motion for Final Approval of Class\nAction Settlement and Application for Attorneys  Fees, the Court\nwas advised of the protocol followed by Analytics in providing\nnotice to class members.   (Rec. doc. 174). Analytics has extensive\nexperience  since 1974 in locating class action claimants.\nAnalytics assisted with the development of a notice plan with the\nobjective of providing effective and efficient notice to class\nmembers regarding the pending class action settlement, providing\nthem with the opportunity to see, read and understand their rights\nand respond as they saw fit.  The notice plan took into account the\n14\n\nlocation of individual class members displaced as a result of the\naftermath of Hurricane Katrina, subsequent to their arrest, booking\nand search and prior to the mailing of the Class Notice.\nAccording  to the affidavit of Mr. Simmons, the following\nfactors were taken into consideration in developing a notice plan\nthat was both cost-effective and reasonably designed to provide\nnotice to class members regarding their rights:\nA.  A complete list of class members, based upon information\nprovided by class members and collected by the Orleans Parish\nCriminal Sheriff’s Office (OPCSO) personnel at the time of\ntheir booking was made available to Analytics by the OPCSO in\ncomputer retrievable format.\nB.  Based upon the OPCSO data, the class consists of more than\n80,481  individuals derived from 143,735 bookings for the\ndescriptions and time periods provided by the Class/Sub-Class\ndefinitions.  OPSCO has represented that this data consisted\nof all computer retrievable data maintained by that office\nregarding potential class members.\nC.  Of the 143,735 booking records provided by OPCSO, 110,545\nlisted an address located in the City of New Orleans (76.9%);\n10,843 listed an address in Jefferson Parish (7.5%); 1,602\nlisted an address in St. Bernard Parish (1.1%); 192 listed an\naddress in Plaquemines Parish (.1%) and 1,137 provided a St.\nTammany Parish address (.8%).  Accordingly, it is apparent\nthat  a total of 124,319 or 86.5% of the potential class\nmembers lived in a 5 parish area in and around the City of New\nOrleans.\nD.  Hurricane Katrina displaced many class members to other\nareas of the country.  However, it was determined that most\npeople concentrated primarily in other parts of Louisiana and\nin Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Texas.\nAnalytics provided direct mailed notice to all class members for\nwhom a mailable street address was available.  Prior to that,\n15\n\nmailing addresses were standardized to U.S. Postal Service (USPS)\nspecifications,  with obvious misspellings, abbreviations and\ntypographical errors corrected; addresses were updated using the\nNCOA database maintained by the USPS, which provided changes of\naddresses  submitted by individuals and families dislocated by\nHurricane  Katrina; addresses were updated using a commercially\navailable database maintained by Lexis/Accurint; after updating\nwith commercially available data, addresses were re-standardized\nand passed against the NCOA database to capture any recent changes\nnot yet reflected in the commercial databases. \nThe notice package in this matter consisted of: 1) an envelope\nspecifically identifying the content and importance of the notice\npackage; 2) a plain language Class Notice providing class members\nwith  information regarding the settlement, their rights and\noptions;  and 3) a claim form personalized with relevant data\nregarding each claimant’s claim such as the subclass that they were\nassigned  to, based upon OPCSO data, and a definition of each\nsubclass for simplified claim submission, with referral to more\ndetailed information if needed.  Copies of the Class Notice and\nClaim Form as mailed are attached as Exhibit B(2) to Rec. doc. 174.\nDirect mailing of notices was sent, by first class mail, to\n79,348 individuals at one or more addresses.  This accounted for a\ndirect mailing to 92.7% of the class as a whole.  \n16\n\nThe direct mailed Class Notice was supplemented with: 1) a\npublished notice campaign targeted to geographic regions with large\nconcentrations  of class members; 2) the dissemination of\ninformation regarding the settlement through use of the internet\nand 3) an outreach program targeted to homeless class members.\nClass counsel informed Analytics that they had received data\nfrom the Louisiana Secretary of State’s Office indicating that\nnewspaper advertisements were placed by that Office regarding the\nmayoral election in the City of New Orleans in April, 2006 and May,\n2006.   The Louisiana Secretary of State ran advertisements in\nselected major metropolitan areas in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,\nGeorgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas where it had\nbeen determined that there were concentrations of displaced persons\nfrom the City.  Analytics, therefore, published notices in those\nsame areas identified by the Louisiana Secretary of State’s Office\nas having had significant numbers of Orleans Parish post-Katrina\nresidents.  That resulted in paid advertisements being placed in 27\nnewspapers and specialty publications in 19 cities, reaching a\npotential audience of approximately 4.2 million readers, over the\ncourse of six months. Publication notices were given in the New\nOrleans area as well.\nAnalytics also established an informational website with a\ndomain name of www.nolastripsearch.com where class members could\n17\n\nobtain  additional information and documents regarding the\nsettlement, including the settlement agreement, answers to common\nquestions, a detailed notice, a claim form and other pertinent\nfacts.  A link to this website was also published at Analytics’\nwebsite.  The inf ormational website was indexed by major search\nengines such as Google and Yahoo!.  Suffice it to say that there\nwere a significant number of “hits” to the strip search website.\nAnalytics  also established a toll free, interactive voice\ntelephone support number to assist potential class members and to\nanswer  questions regarding the settlement.  This system was\noperative 24 hours  per day, 7 days per week.  During business\nhours, class members could request to speak to a service agent to\nassist them and after hours could leave a voice mail message,\nhaving their call returned the following day.\nOutreach to potential homeless class members was handled by\nplacement  of notices in homeless shelters, providing potential\nclass members with information regarding the settlement and an\nopportunity to obtain the detailed notice package.  Class counsel\nconducted meetings with homeless shelters and homeless advocacy and\nsupport groups in April and May, 2007.\nIn response to this notice plan, Analytics received a total of\n6,736 proof of claim and release forms of which 6,328 were timely-\nfiled pursuant to Court order.  5,745 of these filings have been\n18\n\nultimately determined by Analytics to have been made by valid and\nauthorized  claimants. Those claimants are listed in Exhibit C\nannexed to the supplemental report of Analytics dated July 9, 2008.\n(Rec. doc.  184).\nAccording to Rule 23(e), class notice must be given “in a\nreasonable manner.”  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 23(e)(1)(B).  “There are no\nrigid  rules to determine whether a settlement notice to class\nmembers satisfies constitutional and Rule 23(e) requirements....”\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 114 (2nd\nCir.), cert. denied sub nom. 544 U.S. 1044, 125 S.Ct. 2277 (2005).\nIn some circumstances, reasonable notice may require individual\nnotice in the manner required by Rule 23(c)(2)(B) which provides in\npertinent part as follows:\nFor any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court must\ndirect to class members the best notice practicable under the\ncircumstances, including individual notice to all members who\ncan be identified through reasonable effort.\nFed.  R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B)\n(emphasis added); see also Eisen v.\nCarlisle  and Jacquelin ,  417 U.S.\n156,  173, 94 S.Ct. 2150 (1974)\n(elaborating on the constitutional\ndimensions of notice under the Due\nProcess Clause).  \nHowever, actual notice to each p arty who would be bound by the\nadjudication of the class action is not required.  This is because\na  construction of the Due Process Clause which would place\n19\n\nimpossible  or impractical obstacles in the way could not be\njustified.  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S.\n306, 313-14, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657 (1950).  Therefore, when courts have\nevaluated whether a settlement notice is adequate, the focus is not\non  actual notice rates, but rather whether the best notice\npracticable to individuals under the circumstances was achieved\nthrough reasonable effort.  DeJulius v. New England Health Care\nEmployees Pension Fund, 429 F.3d 935, 944 (10th Cir. 2005)(citing\nIn re Integra Realty Res., Inc. , 262 F.3d 1089, 1110 (10 th Cir.\n2001) and Eisen, 417 U.S. at 174, 94 S.Ct. 2140).  Stated another\nway,  “the question is ... not whether some individual...got\nadequate  notice, but whether the class as a whole had notice\nadequate  to flush out whatever objections might reasonably be\nraised to the settlement” Torrisi v. Tucson Elec. Power Co,. 8 F.3d\n1370, 1375 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied sub nom. 512 U.S. 1220, 114\nS.Ct. 2707 (1994).\nThrough multiple methods noted above, notice was targeted to\nindividual class members to inform them of the pendency of the\naction,  the proposed settlement, the settlement terms and\nconditions, the manner of distribution of proceeds, the date and\ntime of the fairness hearing and to determine their interest in the\nsettlement by informing them of their  right to object.  As such,\nthe Court finds that the parties used more than reasonable efforts\n20\n\nto achieve the best notice practicable under the circumstances,\nthereby complying in all respects with Rule 23 and due process\nrequirements.  All of the above actions lead the Court to conclude\nthat  the class members received due and adequate notice in\ncompliance  with the Court’s order preliminarily approving the\nsettlement and that these actions constituted the most reasonable\nmanner of notice under Rule 23(e)(1)(B).\nAnalytics,  Inc., the Court appointed administrator, has\nrecommended  that those individuals listed on Exhibit C of the\nsupplemental  report of Richard Simmons dated July 9, 2008 be\napproved as authorized claimants.  (Rec. doc. 184).  The Court\nconcurs and does so.  Pursuant to the further recommendation of\nAnalytics, Inc., any claim which was deficient, although initially\ntimely-filed, will be rejected if not cured in a timely fashion.\nSpecific individuals whose claims information was incomplete were\ngiven the opportunity to cure initial deficiencies and did not do\nso.   Subsequent  to  the Fairness Hearing, Analytics, Inc. has\nreceived additional claims which have not been processed and the\nCourt directs Analytics, Inc. that no further processing of these\nclaims should occur.\nBecause of the extensive nature of this class, the Court opts\nto impose bright-line deadlines for the filing of claims and the\ncuring  of deficiencies.  With a finite fund of money, to do\n21\n\notherwise makes it impossible to calculate the amount claimants who\nfollowed instructions should receive, needlessly increases costs\nand prevents closure of this matter.\nFAIRNESS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nBefore approving a class settlement that binds members of the\nclass, the Court must conduct a Fairness Hearing at which the\nparties proposing the settlement must present evidence that the\nsettlement is “fair, adequate, and reasonable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(e)(1)(C); Newby v. Enron Corp. , 394 F.3d 296, 300 (5 th Cir.\n2004); Parker v. Anderson, 667 F.2d 1204, 1209 (5 th Cir.), cert.\ndenied,  459 U.S. 828, 103 S.Ct. 63 (1982).  Accordingly, on\nSeptember 13, 2007, the Court held a Fairness Hearing to determine\nwhether it should grant final approval of the settlement proposed\nin this case.\nAt that hearing, the Court heard arguments from proponent\ncounsel and defense counsel.  The Court advised all present that\nanyone who had filed a formal, timely objection to the settlement,\nif present, would be allowed to speak as well.  No one in the\nlatter category came forward at the time of the hearing.  Only\nindividuals favoring the settlement were present and they were\nallowed to speak through their counsel of record, class counsel\nherein.  The Court took note at the time that the vast majority of\nclass members were in favor of the proffered settlement.  The Court\n22\n\nalso received into evidence the affidavits and declarations of\nclass counsel, class representatives, experts as to the fairness,\nreasonableness and adequacy of the settlement and representatives\nof Analytics, Inc. and made same part of the record herein.\nThe Court must be exacting and thorough in analyzing whether\nManual for\nthe settlement is in the best interest of class members, \nComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.61 (2004)\n, and should provide the\nbasis for its conclusions in a reasoned opinion.  For a Court\nshould  not give boilerplate approval to a settlement but must\nanalyze  the facts and law supporting its conclusion.  In re\nCombustion, Inc., 968 F. Supp. 1116, 1124-25 (W.D. La. 1997).\nWhen evaluating a proposed settlement, the Court must compare\nits terms with the rewards the class would likely receive following\na trial and judgment in its favor.  Cotton v. Hinton , 559 F.2d\n1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977).  However, the merits of the case are not\nat issue during the settlement review process.  Reed v. Gen. Motors\nCorp., 703 F.2d 170, 172 (5th Cir. 1983).  Otherwise, a primary goal\nof settlement, i.e., to avoid the expense and delay of trial, would\nbe thwarted.  Id.   The Court is also limited in that it may not\nmake  unilateral modifications or alterations to the proposed\nsettlement, but rather may only accept or reject the agreement as\na whole.  Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 726-27, 106 S.Ct. 1531,\n1537 (1986).  The Court may not resolve contested issues of fact or\n23\n\nlaw,  but instead is concerned with the overall fairness,\nreasonableness and adequacy of the proposed settlement as compared\nto the alternative of litigation.\nThough Rule 23 does not elaborate specific factors necessary\nfor settlement approval, the Fifth Circuit has cited six factors\nthat  a district court should take into consideration when\nevaluating  a proposed class action settlement.  These factors\ninclude:\n(1) the existence of fraud or collusion behind the settlement;\n(2)  the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the\nlitigation; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of\ndiscovery  completed; (4) the probability of plaintiffs’\nsuccess on the merits; (5) the range of possible recovery; and\n(6) the opinions of the class counsel, class representatives,\nand the absent class members.\nReed, 703 F.2d at 172.\nThe Court will consider these six factors, taking into account\nthe statements by counsel, class representatives, and objectors and\nthe  Court’s own knowledge of the litigation obtained from its\nmanagement and involvement in the case since its inception.  Before\nproceeding to the analysis, it is relevant to note that there is a\n“strong judicial policy favoring the resolution of disputes through\nsettlement”  and that a presumption is made in favor of the\nsettlement’s  fairness, absent contrary evidence.  Smith v.\nCrystian, 91 Fed. Appx. 952, 955 (5th Cir. 2004), cert. denied sub\nnom.  543 U.S. 1089, 125 S.Ct. 972 (2005).  The public interest\n24\n\nfavoring  settlement is especially strong in the class action\ncontext where claims are complex and may involve a large number of\nparties,  which otherwise could lead to years of protracted\nlitigation and sky-rocketing expenses.  In re Train Derailment Near\nAmite La., 2006 WL 1561470 at *11 (E.D. La. 2006).  Ultimately,\nhowever,  the  proponents  of the settlement bear the burden of\ndemonstrating that the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.\nHolmes v. Continental Can Co., 706 F.2d 1144, 1147 (11th Cir. 1983).\nFRAUD OR COLLUSION\nA strong presumption exists in favor of settlement if the\ncourt  determines that the settlement resulted from arms-length\nnegotiations between experienced counsel and was not tainted by\nfraud  or collusion.  Wal-Mart Stores ,  396 F.3d at 116. In\nconnection with the settlement process, the Court referred the\nparties to Mr. Roger J. Larue of Mediation Arbitration Professional\nSystems, Inc. on April 23, 2004.  The affidavit of the mediator has\nbeen made part of the record herein.  (Rec. doc. 174, Exhibit D).\nMr. Larue noted that there were significant disputes between\nthe parties during the course of the mediation which occurred on\nMay 18 and 19, 2004.  Not only was the mediation attended by\ncounsel but by several of the class representatives as well as by\nMr.  Michael Geerken, the CAO of the Orleans Parish Criminal\nSheriff’s  office.  A “palpable amount of acrimony between the\n25\n\nparties” was noted by the mediator and the parties were far apart\nin terms of their respective views of the case.  \nUltimately, the parties were able to reach a resolution of the\nclaims which the mediator believes is the “result of good faith\nnegotiations between well-informed, knowledgeable and experienced\ncounsel that was reached after extensive arms-length negotiations”.\nThe  mediator further opined that “all sides vigorously and\naggressively argued their positions” and that all “were aware of\nthe risks inherent in this litigation and the complexity, expense,\nand uncertainty” of continuing forward.\nThe Court notes, through hands-on dealing with counsel for the\nparties  herein, that this case was aggressively pursued and\ndefended by both sides.  Class counsel initiated discovery at the\nearly stages of this matter to obtain booking records from the\nSheriff’s office to identify, investigate and protect the class\ninterest.  In many instances a  motion to compel was required to\nachieve ultimate production of information.\nClass counsel identified and communicated with many members of\nthe  putative class.  Indeed, this identifying information was\nproduced to counsel in an electronic format prior to Hurricane\nKatrina which enabled notice of this settlement to be published to\nthe class after massive destruction occurred at the jail following\nthat storm.  Only through the diligence of class counsel was this\n26\n\ninformation obtained and preserved in a usable format which allows\nthis matter to go forward now to its conclusion.\nAfter the magnitude of the potential class had been confirmed,\nclass  counsel also propounded financial discovery to each\nindividual  defendant to assess that person’s ability to pay\npunitive damages should the case proceed to trial.  Class counsel\nhad always argued that a constitutionally defective policy and\npractice had been maintained at the jail after the decision in\nKelly, supra,which counsel had argued exposed certain individuals\nto liability for punitive damages.  \nHowever, at all times, one of the major issues herein has been\nthe practical problem of whether any of the individual defendants\nhad the financial resources to pay  a significant judgment which\nincluded an element of punitive damages.  Clearly, the Sheriff’s\nOffice itself would not be subject to an award of punitive damages.\nNor, for that matter, could the Sheriff’s Office stand in judgment\nfor any amount because it is not a legal entity capable of being\nsued.  Cozzo v. Tangipahoa Parish Council-President Governmen,t 279\nF.3d 273, 283 (5th Cir. 2002).\nNeither  could the Sheriff or his subordinates in their\nofficial capacities be cast for punitive damages.  This would, in\neffect, be a judgment against the coffers of a governmental entity,\nitself,  against which an award of punitive damages would be\n27\n\nprohibited.  City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247,\n271, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 2762 (1981); Domingue v. Lafayette City Parish\nConsol. Gov’t., 2008 WL 728654 at *22 (W.D. La. March 17, 2008).\nTherefore, only in their individual capacities could the named\ndefendants be responsible for punitive damages, even though the\ncoffers  of  the  public entity could be responsible for actual\ndamages proven by plaintiffs against defendants in their official\ncapacities.\nThe Court had to order the exchange of financial information\nas  to the individual defendants, as this too was resisted.\nAdditionally,  class counsel participated in the review of the\nfinances of the Sheriff’s Office, employing a municipal finance\nexpert to meet with the CPA of the Sheriff’s Office to analyze the\nability of the Office to pay any compensatory judgment that might\nbe rendered against the defendants in their official capacities. \nThe Court further notes that, post Hurricane Katrina, even\nthough a settlement figure had been agreed upon by counsel, it was\nunclear whether that amount would be available to the class due to\nthe massive destruction occasioned to the Sheriff’s facilities.\nThe Court authorized the Sheriff to borrow against these funds, if\nneed be, to get the Office up and running again following that\ndevastating time in the City of New Orleans. Ultimately, the fund\nremained intact and is currently still available to the class.\n28\n\nAs a result of this litigation, there has been a re-writing of\nthe prior policy and practice of the Sheriff’s Office pertaining to\nthe  strip searching and body cavity searching of individuals\nbrought into the Orleans Parish Prison system.  In the second\nconsent  decree, privacy or “change out” booths, which are\nessentially dressing rooms, were established in the jail, which\nbenefits a significant number of minor offenders passing through\nthe jail each year.  \nThe Court determines that settlement is in the best interest\nof  the parties and the class here.    Should  this  matter have\nproceeded to trial, there were key facts disputed by both sides.\nAdditionally, the plaintiffs are individuals who were brought to\njail pursuant to an arrest and, as a practical matter, that creates\nthe  distinct possibility that these individuals would not be\nbelieved because of their past criminal records.  \nFurthermore, the pursuit of damage claims by members of the\nclass, which is what this settlement addresses, could easily result\nin little or no money being awarded due to insufficiency of proof\npertaining  to each individual.  Most individuals did not have\nsupporting  medical or documentary evidence to establish an\nindividualized  claim for damages.  And, indeed, most private\nattorneys would not want to be burdened with the representation of\nan individual with such a limited damage claim.  All members of the\n29\n\nputative  class could have hired private counsel before this\nlitigation  was instituted to deal with their strip search\nexperiences but few, if any, did so, attesting to the difficulty in\nproving up damages under these circumstances and the embarrassment\nattendant to coming forward and pursuing such a claim.\nThe Court is aware of jurisprudence dealing with agreements to\npay  attorneys’ fees and how such agreements may give rise to\nperceived or actual conflicts of interest, fraud or collusion.\nSee The Courts and the Plaintiff’s Bar:\n, e.g., William J. Lynk, \nAwarding the Attorney’s Fee in Class-Action Litigation\n, 23 J. Legal\nStud.  185, 186  (1994).   The Court will, hereinafter, examine\ncounsels’ request for fees, in light of specific documentation as\nto time and rates to determine whether the fee sought is fair.\nThe Court is convinced that settlement has been achieved after\narms-length negotiation and without fraud or collusion on the part\nof  anyone.  The ability of the Sheriff’s Office and of the\nindividual defendants to pay a substantial judgment has always been\nan  issue herein  as  has the provable scope of damages for the\nindividual  plaintiffs.  This settlement represents a brokered\ncompromise which benefits both sides.  And, more importantly, this\nlitigation has brought an end to further continuation of what has\nbeen  viewed by plaintiffs as an unconstitutional policy and\npractice.\n30\n\nA  presumption exists that settlement negotiations were\nconducted properly in the absence of collusion if the terms of the\nproposed  settlement are demonstrably fair.  In re Corrugated\nContainer Antitrust Litig., 643 F.2d 195, 212 (5th Cir. 1981), cert.\ndenied sub nom. 456 U.S. 1012, 102 S.Ct. 2308 and 456 U.S. 998, 102\nS.Ct.  2283 (1982).  The Court believes that the quality and\ncomprehensiveness of the benefits provided to class members under\nthe settlement agreement adequately compensate the class members.\nClass counsel are skilled attorneys who have extensive experience\nwith this type of litigation and  have used this knowledge at the\nbargaining table to conduct meaningful negotiations.  Counsel for\nboth sides engaged in vigorous advocacy and the settlement was\nachieved in the context of the adversarial process.  \nThe Court, therefore, concludes that the proposed settlement\nwas negotiated by the parties free of fraud or collusion.\nCOMPLEXITY, EXPENSE AND DURATION OF LITIGATION\nThis litigation has been pending for some period of time.\nInitially, the Court focused on the request for injunctive relief\nwhich was resolved through a consent judgment.  The only remaining\nissue was whether a damage class should or should not be certified.\nInitially, the parties sought certification of a damage class under\nsections of Rule 26 other than Rule 26(b)(3), which the Court did\nnot find tenable under current jurisprudence.  The Court’s failure\n31\n\nto certify a class under another section of the Rule certainly gave\nrise to appealable issues.\nPlaintiffs’  claims for damages and defendants’ response\nthereto are complex as are many issues in this litigation.  As\nnoted earlier, many plaintiffs are embarrassed to come forward to\ndiscuss  being strip-searched.  Few of the plaintiffs have the\nextensive medical records needed to prove up a comprehensive claim\nfor post traumatic stress disorder attendant to a strip search.  It\nis questionable whether a trier of fact would find the plaintiffs\ntotally believable given the fact that they were under arrest when\nthe alleged offenses occurred.\nWinning a verdict would not, per  se, mean that plaintiffs\nwould  obtain compensation.  Punitive damages would not be\nforthcoming  against the Sheriff’s Office and the individual\ndefendants are of limited means.  The potential bankruptcy of the\nSheriff’s Office was also raised.\nA verdict in favor of the class would surely have raised\nappealable issues, which would further protract this litigation in\nterms of time and expense.  Should the Court have opted at any\npoint not to certify a damage class, plaintiffs’ rights would have\nbeen extremely compromised because multiple individual litigations\ncould have resulted or rights could have been lost in the entirety\nif plaintiffs did not obtain individual counsel to pursue them.\n32\n\nThis would result in further delaying the payment of funds and\nrunning up attorneys’ fees exponentially.  \nThe Court is convinced that, but for resolution of this matter\nby  compromise,  a  further complicated, lengthy and expensive\nenterprise  would have been undergone by both sides, with no\nassurance as to a result.  This settlement provides the closure\nthat all sides need to go forward.\nSTAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND AMOUNT OF DISCOVERY COMPLETED\nThe stage of the proceedings and the nature and extent of\ndiscovery can be significant factors in evaluating the fairness of\na settlement.  Although it is not essential that all or nearly all\ndiscovery be completed in order for a court to conclude that this\nfactor supports a finding of fairness, it certainly strengthens the\nargument for approval of settlement.  In re Corrugated Container,\n643 F.2d at 211.  \nIn  this case, a significant amount of discovery had been\nconducted and completed.  And, the Court is convinced that the\nparties  have sufficient information  about  the  strengths  and\nweaknesses of their respective cases to make a reasoned judgment\nabout the wisdom of settling the case.  Counsel are all seasoned\npractitioners in the field of §1983 matters.  The problems with\nproving extensive damages on the part of individual plaintiffs is\npalpable, given the lack of medical records pertaining to them.\n33\n\nAccordingly,  the Court finds that the parties were fully\ninformed of the factual and legal obstacles presented by continuing\nforward and possessed more than sufficient information to determine\nthat settlement was preferable to further litigating this matter.\nPROBABILITY OF PLAINTIFFS’ SUCCESS ON THE MERITS\nThe risks to the class if settlement had not been reached, in\nterms of establishing liability, damages and maintaining the class\nthrough trial were not insignificant.  While the Kelly , or Sub-\nclass A class members, might have prevailed on summary judgment as\nto liability, damages were a larger problem in that each individual\nwas different.  Other than their  own individual testimony, most\npeople had no medical records to support anything other than a\nnominal award.  Claims asserted by other proposed subclasses, such\nas the “change out” class, which dealt with the exposing of the\nnaked  bodies of detainees while changing into jail garb, were\nargued  not to constitute a search of the person.  Qualified\nimmunity issues further loomed on the “change out” issue which was\nnot a part of the earlier Kelly litigation. \nAll class members faced the risk of having a fact finder view\ntheir damages as de  minimis.  For as has been noted, “the vast\nmajority of [strip search] claims would never be brought unless\naggregated because provable actual damages are too small.”  Tadiff\nv.  Knox County ,  365 F.3d 1, 7 (1 st  Cir. 2004).  And even if\n34\n\nliability was a  proper subject for certification, had the Court\nrefused  to certify a damage class, counsel would no longer\nrepresent these individuals and there c ould be no resolution of\nthis matter on a class wide basis.  With the displacement of people\nfollowing Hurricane Katrina, it is doubtful that many people who\nwill benefit from settlement funds would have received any money or\nhad anyone to represent them to pursue a damage claim.\nThe aforementioned obstacles mitigate in favor of a settlement\nof the claims rather than pressing forward with litigation.\nRANGE OF POSSIBLE RECOVERY\nIn any case there is a range of reasonableness with respect to\na settlement - a range which recognizes the uncertainties of law\nand fact in any particular case and the concomitant risks and costs\nnecessarily  inherent in taking any litigation to completion.\nNewman v. Stein, 464 F.2d 689, 692 (2 nd Cir.), cert. denied, 409\nU.S. 1039, 93 S.Ct. 521 (1992).  A court will, therefore, determine\nif any legal or factual obstacles exist in a case and then inquire\nwhether the settlement’s terms fall within a reasonable range of\nrecovery, given the likelihood of the plaintiffs’ success on the\nmerits.  In doing so the Court must remain aware that:\n[c]ompromise is the essence of settlement and the court should\nnot make the proponents of a proposed settlement justify each\nterm  of settlement against a hypothetical or speculative\nmeasure of which concessions might have been gained; inherent\nin compromise is  a yielding of absolutes and abandoning of\n35\n\nhighest hopes.  \nNelson v. Waring, 602 F. Supp.\n410,  413 (N.D. Miss.\n1983)(quoting Cotton v. Hinton,\n559 F. 2d 1326, 1330 (5 th Cir.\n1977)).\nThe initial settlement fund herein was $9.375 million and it\nis currently in excess of $10 million  even after taking costs of\nadministration of the fund into account.  A gross settlement in\nthis amount is a significant achievement from any public entity but\nespecially so from this entity which is self-insured.   Depending\nupon which Sub-Class a person falls into, the awards are expected\nto range between slightly in excess of $1,000.00 for those members\nof Sub-Class A (the Kelly class) to about $350.00 for Sub-Class B\n(the change out class) and approximately $525.00 for Sub-Class C.\nThe settlement provides for all funds to be distributed by\nproviding  one payment to each class member.  Individuals are\npresumed to be a member of one or more Sub-Classes if their names\nappear on the Sheriff’s Office  records.  If a member falls into\nmore than one Sub-Class, that person will receive compensation\nprovided for the highest compensable Sub-Class into which he or she\nfalls.    Individuals  receive payment without the need for any\nindividual  proof of damages or even establishing that he/she\nactually underwent a strip-search.\nClass members had the option to exclude themselves from the\n36\n\nsettlement to pursue  individual claims.  The putative class, as\ncalculated by counsel was in excess of  85,000 people.  Only 27\nrequests for exclusion were received.  Of this number, at least\nhalf  requested never to be contacted again, stating that they\nwanted nothing to do with this settlement, that they expected no\npayment and/or denying that they were strip-searched.\nDistrict courts in other jurisdictions have approved lump-sum\nsettlements in similar strip search class actions, with per class\nmember payout amounts similar to those proposed in this matter.  In\nMcBean v. City of New York , 228 F.R.D. 487 (S.D. N.Y.  2005), a\nsettlement  that provided an award of $750.00 per single strip\nsearch  and $1,000.00 for multiple stip searches was found\n“consistent with awards for similar class action claims”.  In Tyson\nv. City of New York , 97-CV-3762 (S.D. N.Y.), $250.00 was found\nadequate per class member.  An award of $426.21 for a strip-search\nwas approved as reasonable in Williams v. Block, 97-CV-3826 (C.D.\nCalif.).  In Eddleman v. Jefferson County, 96 F.3d 1448 (6th Cir.\n1996)(table),  class members received approximately $750.00 for\nhaving been strip searched.  Although not a class action, it has\nbeen held that a nominal damage award  in a strip-search case of\n$100.00 is acceptable.  Williams v. Kaufman County, 352 F.3d 994,\n1014 (5th Cir. 2003).  \nThe Court, therefore, finds that the estimated awards herein\n37\n\nfall  within a range of reasonableness established through the\njurisprudence.  See also Affidavit of Howard Friedman, Exhibit A,\nattached to Rec. doc. 174.\n38\n\nOPINIONS OF CLASS COUNSEL, CLASS REPRESENTATIVES, ETC.\nCounsel are the Court’s “main source of information about the\nsettlement” and, therefore, the Court will give weight to class\ncounsel’s opinion regarding the fairness of settlement.  Cotton ,\nManual for Complex Litigation §21.641.  \n559 F.2d at 1330;  Class\ncounsel’s opinion should be presumed reasonable because they are in\nthe  best position to evaluate fairness due to an intimate\nfamiliarity with the lawsuit.  Boyd v. Bechtel Corp., 485 F. Supp.\n610, 622 (N.D. Cal. 1979).  It is the duty of a court to give class\ncounsel’s recommendations appropriate weight in light of all the\nfactors surrounding the settlement.  Id.\nSuffice  it to say that all class counsel and all class\nrepresentatives  believe that the proposed settlement is fair,\nreasonable and adequate.  Furthermore, the attitude of absent class\nmembers, expressed either directly or indirectly by their failure\nto  object after notice or high level of participation in the\nproposed settlement agreement, is an additional factor on which\ndistrict  courts generally place heavy emphasis.  In re\nMicrostrategy, Inc. Sec. Litig., 150 F.Supp.2d 896, 905-06 (E.D.\nVa. 2001).  If only a small number of objections are received, that\nfact can be viewed as indicative of the adequacy of the settlement.\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., supra.  In the current litigation, any class\nmember who felt dissatisfied with the settlement could object to\n39\n\nthe settlement and/or exclude himself/herself from the settlement\nand bring an individual claim.  Only two class members timely\nobjected3/ to the settlement and only twenty-seven people timely\nexcluded themselves.  (Rec. doc. 174, Exh. B(14)).  The paucity of\nindividuals who have objected or excluded themselves gives rise to\na  strong presumption that the settlement terms are fair and\nreasonable.\nIn summary, a review of the Reed  factors supports a finding\nthat the settlement should be approved.\n  The Court next gives consi deration to the  incentive awards\nsought by the seven class representatives in this litigation, i.e.,\nJeff Bright, William Brice White III, Lionel Nelson, George Wurz,\nAnthony Pogorzelski, Anthony Buchen and Sylvia Brown.  The Court\nnotes that all seven individuals are of the opinion that each of\nthem should receive the same incentive award in that all have\ncontributed  collectively and are jointly responsible for the\nachievements obtained herein. See Plaintiffs’ Motion & Incorporated\n3/ See Rec. doc. 174, Exhibit B(15), for the name of one\nindividual who objected.  That individual advised that he did not\nwant to opt out of the settlement but felt that he should receive\nmore money as a member of Sub-Class B than he calculated he would\nreceive.  \nThe  parties have also considered claimant # 153058 as an\nobjector, even though Analytics did not include his name on Exhibit\nB(15)referenced above.  The Court has reviewed this individual’s\nfiling and notes that he is included in the list of individuals who\nwill receive a payment.  He, too, would like to receive more money\nthan he calculates he will receive.\n40\n\nMemorandum in Support of Incentive Awards for Class Representatives\n(Rec. doc. 175).  \nIt is undisputed that “[c]ourts commonly permit payments to\nclass representatives above those received in settlement by class\nmembers generally.”  Smith v. Tower Loan of Miss., Inc,. 216 F.R.D.\n338, 368 (S.D. Miss. 2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1089, 125 S.Ct.\n972 (2005); In re Catfish Antitrust Litig., 939 F. Supp. 493, 504\n(N.D. Miss. 1996).  Incentive awards are based upon the actions\nthat these individuals have taken to protect the interests of the\nclass, the degree to which the class benefitted from those actions,\nthe amount of time and effort the named plaintiffs expended in\npursuing  the litigation and any negative effects on the named\nplaintiffs.  In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust\nLitig., 292 F.Supp.2d 184, 189 (D. Me. 2003).\nAn incentive award of $20,000.00 for each class representative\nhas been sought herein.  Class counsel has pointed out that such an\nincentive award is consistent with incentive awards made in other\nstrip search cases.  See Craft v. County of San Bernardino 05-CV-\n359 (C.D. Cal. March 31, 2008);  Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County\nand Will County, Ill., 03-CV-3086 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 27 2006); Bynum\nv. District of Columbia, 412 F.Supp.2d 73, 80-81 (D. D.C. 2006).\nAccordingly, the Court will award the sum of $20,000.00 as an\nincentive award to each of the seven named class representatives\n41\n\nherein.\nThe  final remaining issue which must be decided herein\npertains to the request of class counsel for attorneys’ fees and\ncosts.  Class counsel seek to be compensated at a percentage rate\nof  37% of the common fund, originally constituted at $9.375\nmillion, together with the interest which has accrued thereon while\non deposit.  Class counsel request  that the Court award a single\namount as attorneys’ fees and one for total costs, which counsel\nwill divide amongst themselves in a fair and equitable fashion.\nThe jurisprudence has long recognized that, under a theory of\nequity known as the “common benefit” doctrine, a party preserving\nor recovering a  fund for the benefit of others in addition to\nhimself may recover his costs, including attorneys’ fees, from the\nproperty or fund itself or directly from the other parties enjoying\nthe benefit. Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert , 444 U.S. 472, 478, 100 S.\nCt. 745, 749 (1980);  Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U.S. 527 (1882);\nAlyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Society , 421 U.S. 240,\n258,  95 S.Ct. 1612, 1621-22 (1975).  As a general rule in\nLouisiana, the right of an attorney to remuneration for services is\ndependent upon a contract, either express or implied.  Louisiana\nState Mineral Board v. Abadie, 164 So.2d 159, 166 (La. App. s1t Cir.\n1964).  An exception to this rule is recognized in those instances\nwhere an attorney, alone and at his own expense, has successfully\n42\n\nmaintained an action for the preservation, protection, increase, or\ncreation of a fund in which persons other than his own clients may\nshare or from which they may  benefit.  Kirkpatrick v. Young, 456\nSo.2d  622, 625 (La. 1984); In re Interstate Trust & Banking\nCompany, 235 La. 825, 843, 106 So.2d 276, 282 (La. 1958).  In such\ninstances, equity requires that all who benefit must pay the costs\nand expenses incident thereto, including attorneys’ fees.  Indeed,\nRule 23(h) formally recognizes the equitable power of the court to\nset common benefits fees in the class  action setting in that it\nprovides as follows:\nIn  a certified class action, the court may\naward  reasonable attorney’s fees and\nnontaxable costs that are authorized by law or\nby the parties’ agreement. ...\nThere would appear to be two methods by which the Court can\ncalculate attorneys’ fees herein, i.e., the lodestar method or an\naward of a percentage of the fund.  A “lodestar” fee award is\ncomputed  by multiplying the number of hours expended by the\nattorneys’ hourly rates.  That figure may then be adjusted upward\nor downward in the discretion of the Court based upon the twelve\nfactors set forth in Johnson v. Georgia Hwy. Express, Inc. , 488\nF.2d 714, 717 (5th Cir. 1974).  The twelve Johnson factors include:\n1) the time and labor required; 2) the novelty and difficulty of\nthe question involved; 3) the skill requisite to perform the legal\n43\n\nservice properly; 4) the preclusion of other employment by the\nattorney(s) due to acceptance of the case; 5) the customary fee; 6)\nwhether the fee is fixed or contingent; 7) time limitations imposed\nby the client or the circumstances; 8) the amount involved and\nresults obtained; 9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the\nattorneys; 10) the “undesirability” of the case; 11) the nature and\nthe length of the professional relationship with the client; and,\n12) awards in similar cases.  Id. at 717-19.\nAs has been noted by other courts, the Fifth Circuit seems to\naccept a “blended” approach, wherein a percentage fee method is\nused with analysis of the Johnson factors to assure the fairness of\nthe amount awarded.  Turner v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., 422 F.Supp.2d\n676, 682 (E.D. La. 2006); In re Bayou Sorrel Class Action, 2006 WL\n3230771 at *3 (W.D. La. 2006).  \nThe  Court initially notes that, in Louisiana, it is not\nuncommon for contingency fees to be at least 40% when matters have\nbeen thoroughly prepared for litigation and proceed forward to\ntrial.  Certainly most contingency fee contracts in Louisiana for\ntort-type personal injury suits command at least a 33.3% fee, even\nif settled pre-trail.  Therefore, the fee sought by counsel of 37%\nof amount of the fund is not, per se, unreasonable.\nHowever, the Court notes that in the information published to\npotential class members, class counsel specifically advised the\n44\n\nclass that a lesser percentage would be sought in fees.  See Rec.\ndoc. 174, Exhibit B(2) at page 5, wherein the following is noted:\n24. How will the lawyers be paid?\nClass  Counsel will ask the Court for\nattorneys’ fees in the amount of 35% of the\nsettlement fund, plus reimbursement of their\nexpenses.  The Court may award more or less\nthan these amounts.\nThis information was contained in the Class Notice and claim form\ncirculated to the class which, the Court has reason to conclude,\nthese people relied upon in determining whether to object to the\nproposed settlement.  Accordingly, the Court is of the opinion that\ncounsel should be limited to the amount of fees that the class was\nadvised would be sought herein, i.e., 35% of the settlement fund\nplus reimbursement of expenses.\nMeasuring this sum in light of the Johnson factors, the Court\nnotes that counsel have documented the following number of hours as\nhaving been invested into the handling of this matter: \n                                Attorney hours  Staff hours\nHowell & Snead Law Firm     326.70     380.83\nMary E. Howell            1,198.24      21.5\nD. Majeeda Snead          1,514.31\nChristina Norris          2,309.03      70.25\nSamuel S. Dalton          2,763.84     188.63\n45\n\nTOTAL                8,112.12     661.21\nItemized time sheets documenting these expenditures of time have\nbeen furnished, as to which the Court has no reason to question the\naccuracy.   The Court notes that this has been a vigorously\ncontested matter which has continued for over seven years.  The\nhours expended by counsel during this time reflect, and the Court\nhas observed, the highest quality of dedication and professionalism\nby all class counsel who have had to litigate exceedingly hard to\nobtain the favorable result which has finally been achieved.  Class\ncounsel  have performed their duties and responsibilities in a\nhighly capable manner for the best interests of the class.\nClass counsel have advised the Court that an hourly rate of\n$350.00  per hour for their time would be appropriate.  That\nassertion has been supported through affidavits of class counsel\nand of other attorneys, i.e., William Rittenberg, William Wessel,\nWilliam Quigley and Jack Dveirin.  See Rec. doc. 177, Exhibits G,\nH, I and M.  In addition, class counsel utilized the services of\nlaw  students to perform some tasks involving research,\ninvestigation and interviews with some class members.  For that\ntime  and effort, class counsel have sought to have those\nindividuals compensated at the rate of $75.00.  The Court does not\ntake issue with the hourly rate sought by any class counsel in this\n46\n\nlitigation or any of their support staff and approves same as\nappropriate for this long-fought litigation.\nCounsel, therefore, seek a lodestar fee calculation for the\nexperienced attorneys at 8,112.12 hours multiplied by $350.00 per\nhour which equals $2,839,242.00.  To this sum 661.22 hours for\nsupport staff, i.e., students and paralegals, at a rate of $75.00\nper  hours for an additional $49,591.50 is sought.  The total\nlodestar  fee would, therefore, be calculated at $2,888,833.00.\nCounsel acknowledge an adjustment to this amount by subtracting\n$116,088.00 in interim fees already received should be taken out so\nthat the final lodestar amount is $2,772,745.00.  This final amount\nis $986,151 less than a fee calculated as a contingency recovery of\n37% of the total award would yield, minus the interim fees paid, as\nclass counsel calculate that 37% fee to be $3,758,896.00.\nCounsel seek the application of a multiplier under the Johnson\nfactors to increase the lodestar amount to the 37% contingency fee\nwhich was negotiated with the class representatives.  In this case,\ncounsel suggest that a multiplier of 1.355 to the lodestar figure\nof $ 2,772,745.00 would increase the attorney fee award to close to\nthe contingency award sought of 37%.  Although counsel will not be\nawarded more than 35% in fees, the  Court notes these figures for\ncomparison with other cases where multipliers were allowed.\nIn seeking such a multiplier to the lodestar, class counsel\n47\n\nspecifically argue that, pursuant to factors (3) the customary fee,\n(8)  the amount involved and the results obtained, (9) the\nexperience,  reputation and ability of the attorneys, (10) the\nundesirability of the case and (12) awards in similar cases, the\nCourt would be justified in awarding such an increase.  The Court\nconcurs with class counsel’s argument on these issues.\nAs has been noted earlier, the customary contingency fee for\nrepresentation of personal injury plaintiffs in this area, in cases\nless contentious than this one, ranges from 33.3% to upwards of 40%\nof the gross award plus costs.  As to the amount involved and the\nresult obtained, the Court knows of no other settlement in the\nState of Louisiana where counsel have attempted to obtain relief\npertaining to strip searches.  The result obtained herein was the\nfirst of its kind in this State.  The case was hard-fought at all\ntimes.  Furthermore, to obtain this large of a fund from a public\nentity and to maintain the fund post-Katrina when that entity was\nstrapped for funds to make repairs and get up and running again was\nno small accomplishment.  Lastly, part of the hours sought herein\npertain to injunctive relief which was obtained some years ago for\nwhich  counsel did not receive payment following their\naccomplishments.\nThe attorneys involved in this matter are among the best civil\nrights attorneys in this area.   This was not a desirable case.\n48\n\nFew, if any, private attorneys would have taken on a project such\nas  this.  It is hardly a popular cause to represent arrested\nindividuals against law enforcement.  L astly, as noted  by class\ncounsel,  the attorneys representing the defendants vigorously\nrepresent  their respective clients in  all  litigations, making\nplaintiffs’ counsel work for every step forward they were able to\nachieve.  The resources of the defendants outstripped those of\nclass counsel who were forced to  invest money on which they have\nwaited over seven years to obtain a return.\nFinally, upward adjustment of lodestar fees has been approved\nin other cases.  See  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., supra, (increase to\nlodestar  of 3.5 in antitrust class action deemed reasonable);\nFischel v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc’y of U.S. , 98 Fed. Appx.\n581, 583 (9th Cir. 2004)(multiplier of 2 to class counsel’s lodestar\napproved);  Bernadi v. Yeutter ,  951 F.2d 971, 975 (9 th  Cir.\n1991)(multiplier of 2 to lodestar figure sought by class counsel in\ncivil rights case appropriate to account for risk of contingent fee\nand to ensure that counsel will accept civil rights cases); Local\n56, United food & Commercial Workers Union v. Campbell Soup Co. ,\n954 F. Supp. 1000, 1004 (D. N.J. 1997)(agreed upon class counsel’s\nfees with a 2.39 multiplier on the lodestar cross-check would not\nbe reduced because such an award was fair and reasonable); Garza v.\nSporting Goods Properties, Inc., 1996 WL 56247 at *33 (W.D. Tex.\n49\n\n1996)(multipliers  of 3.5 and 4 were appropriate under the\ncircumstances); Thompson v. Connick, 2007 WL 1772060 at *4 (E.D.\nLa. 2007)(upward adjustment of 50% of fees approved); Faircloth v.\nCertified  Fin. Inc. ,  2001 WL 527489 at *10 (E.D. La.\n2001)(multiplier of 3 to enhance lodestar approved which resulted\nin fees of roughly 35% to counsel).\nAdditionally, class counsel have itemized common fund court\ncosts and expenses incurred by them as follows:\nH&S      Howell    Snead       Norris         Dalton\nAirfare                                    $20,696.42\nCar Rental                                  10,277.71\nFax                     $178.25                 396.91       89.80\nOvernight Mail $106.66    22.40   26.16        437.40    1,003.29\nAuto Fuel                                      607.13\nPostage                   24.33                 28.22      219.05\nCopying       1,046.53 1,272.55              2,672.59    4,574.93\nLD Calls        160.05    77.76              1,381.41       48.14\nParking          40.50    36.00    9.00      2,352.88       38.25\nMileage          29.82    23.58                642.76      570.88\nCourt costs    150.00\nExperts/Consultants   9,315.81              12,696.52   13,951.51\nInvestigative  472.50                                      102.90\nCt.

Therefore,  class\ncounsel have sought reimbursement for the sum of $83,467.31 for\nwhich they are clearly entitled.  See  Rec. doc. 177, Exhibit N.\nThe Court further notes that the class was notified of the\nfact that counsel were seeking fees, together with the percentage\nwhich counsel were asking, as well as the fact that counsel were\nseeking reimbursement for their costs.  As with the settlement as\na whole, there were very few individuals expressing discontent with\nthe amounts sought.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court is of the opinion that a\n35% award of fees sought by counsel is appropriate and will award\nthat amount of fees and costs as sought hereinabove.

Gusman, only in his official capacity as the present Criminal \nSheriff of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, by and through their undersigned counsel, respectfully submit \nthis Memorandum in Support of the Joint Motion For Preliminary Approval of the Class Action \nSettlement Agreement. \nAt the outset, it should be noted that Sheriff Gusman had no involvement in any of the \npolicies or practices at issue in this case. These policies and practices were discontinued prior to the \ndate he assumed office as Criminal Sheriff.  Sheriff Gusman enters into the Settlement Agreement \nPage I of 29 \n\nonly in his official capacity as the present Criminal Sheriff, in order to carry into effect the \nobligations of settlement of the case which are the legal obligations of the Orleans Parish Criminal \nSheriffs Office (OPCSO) because they were agreed to by his predecessors in office and became \nbinding on the Sheriffs Office prior to Sheriff Gusman's election as Sheriff. \nI.  INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY STATEMENT: \nOn May 19,2004, after participating in two long days of mediation with a Court-appointed \nmediator, the parties to this action agreed to a proposed settlement of this case. The proposed Class \nAction Settlement Agreement (\"Settlement Agreement\") sets forth the background, terms and \nconditions of this settlement; capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given \nto them in the Settlement Agreement. \nThe settlement provides for the creation of a Fed. R.  Civ. P. Rule 23(b)(3) settlement \nClass/Sub-classes and a Settlement Fund in the amount of$9,375,000.00, plus interest accruing from \nJune 2, 2004.  This Settlement Fund is to provide for the distribution of money to those individuals \nwho were arrested for minor offenses only, not involving drugs or weapons, during the stipulated time \nperiods, whose constitutional rights are alleged to have been violated when Defendants subjected \nthem to blanket strip andlor visual body cavity searches (pursuant to the now discontinued blanket \npolicy and practices oft he OPCSO), when they were transferred to general population of the Orleans \nParish jail, prior to their first court appearance or release, whichever happened first. \nThere are three separate Sub-Classes, as defined in the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement \nAgreement also provides a proposed distribution grid with a mathematical formula for computing and \nPage 2 of 29 \n\ndistributing the. funds to Class Membersl Long and Short Form Notices, a Proof of Claim and \n, \nRelease, and notice plan information. In addition to providing for monetary relieffor class members, \nthe Settlement Fund will also pay all attorneys fees, costs and expenses incurred in prosecuting this \naction (Plus interest at the same rate and for the same periods as earned by the Settlement Fund), as \nwell as all costs of notice and the fees and costs associated with the approval and administration of \nthis settlement. \nThis settlement represents the culmination of over six (6) years of hard-fought and well-\ndefended  litigation.  Class  Counsel  have,  among other things:  conducted  discovery,  reviewed \nnumerous documents, researched and developed successful strategies, filed and defended against a \nnumber of motions, supporting those motions with well researched briefs and memoranda, attended \ninnumerable status conferences, obtained three (3) Consent Decrees affording injunctive and other \nrelief, helped to design and conducted inspections ofp rivacy booths to protect the privacy of the men \nand women who are arrested for minor charges only and processed through the Orleans Parish jail \nfacilities, and monitored the processing of these arrestees on a monthly basis for more than two years \nafter injunctive relief was obtained.  Such efforts not only contributed to the injunctive relief on \nbehalf of the original Rule 23(b) (2) Class/Sub-Classes; but also resulted in material and permanent \nchanges in Defendants' policies and practices and significantly contributed to an environment in \nwhich settlement of the damages portion of this litigation was feasible. \nSince settlement negotiations began in earnest in September, 2003, the negotiations were \nextensive, protracted, on-agaiIiloff-agaln, and interspersed with continued efforts towards trial \nIUnless the context otherwise requires, \"Class Member\" or \"Class/Sub-class Member\" \nshall mean a putative or actual member of any of the Sub-classes now or hereafter certified in \nthis case. \nPage 3 of 29 \n\npreparation.  Counsel for the parties met on numerous occasions in efforts to resolve the litigation \nthrough settlement.  When that process was not successful, the Court finally referred the parties to \nmediation. Two full days of intensive negotiations produced what the parties consider to be a fair and \ngood faith settlement, negotiated at arms-length, that offers a fair, meaningful and final solution to \nthe difficult and complex issues involved in this litigation. \nSubsequent to the parties having agreed on the general terms for settlement of this litigation, \nthe parties engaged in numerous meetings, Court conferences, document drafting sessions, and other \nefforts to bring this settlement to completion. A status hearing on the settlement was scheduled with \nthe Court on August 29, 2005, the same day Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans.  Obviously, \nHurricane Katrina and its devastating impact upon the City of New Orleans put that status hearing \nand the entire case on hold.  In fact, shortly after the City was devastated, Sheriff Gusman filed a \nmotion with the Court seeking a temporary loan and transfer oft he money set aside in the Settlement \nFund in the event these funds might have to be used to assist with post-storm recovery efforts. Class \nCounsel opposed this Motion.  The Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Sheriff s motion via \ntelephone, as New Orleans counsel and the Court were displaced as a result of the aftermath of \nKatrina.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court granted the Sheriff's motion and set conditions \nfor the temporary (one  year) loan to the Sheriff's office, with which the Sheriff complied.  As it \nturned out, the Sheriff did not have to use this Settlement Fund and at the end of the one-year period, \nthe money was returned, with interest earned.  Since that time the parties have renewed their efforts \nto conclude this matter, have continued to meet separately and with the Court, and are now in a \nposition to move forward to finally resolve this lawsuit. \nPage40f 29 \n\nThe parties respectfully submit that the terms of this settlement are fair, reasonable and \nadequate for the Class/Sub-Classes sought to be certified, and the parties believe the requirements for \nfinal approval will be completely satisfied at the fairness hearing.  At this time, the only real issue \nbefore the Court is whether the proposed settlement is within the range of what may be found to be \nfair, adequate and reasonable, so notice of the settlement can be issued to the Class Members and the \nfairness hearing can be scheduled. Only after the Class Members receive notice and have been given \nthe opportunity to opt out, object and/or  present supporting or opposing evidence at the fairness \nhearing, will the Court be called upon to render a [mal judgment regarding the fairness of this \nproposed settlement. \nTherefore, pursuant to Federal Rule 23(e), Plaintiffs and Defendants have jointly moved the \nCourt to grant preliminary approval to the Settlement Agreement and to certify the Class/Sub-Classes \nas defined in the Settlement Agreement.  The parties further ask the Court to assign a date for the \nfairness hearing and to enter its Order of Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement so notice \nmay be issued in the manner set forth in the Settlement Agreement and substantially in the form of \n2 \nthe Exhibits thereto.  The parties suggest the following time-line for the various steps in the final \napproval process: \nITEM  EVENT  DATE \nI  Submission of Class Action Settlement Agreement  12/14/06 \n2These are preliminary dates for purposes of example only.  These dates and the \nincremental periods between the various stages are obviously subject to the Court's calendar, \navailability, and judgment. \nPage 5 of 29 \n\n2  Defendants deliver to Claims Administrator information needed for  DONE \nmailing lists, merging documents, notices and verification of Class \nMembers' identity and location \n3  Mail notice completed by  01/29/07 \nj \n4  Publication notice begins by  02/29/07 \n.i \n5  Deadline for filing objections and notice of objections, intent to appear  07/02/07 \nor notice to \"opt-out\" (Request for Exclusion) \n6  Claim Date: Deadline by which Proof of Claim must be actually  08/02/07 \nreceived by the Claims Administrator \n7  F aimess hearing  09/14/07 \n8  Claims Administrator will send out Request for Cure for any deficient  10/02/07 \nclaims by \n9  Cure Date: Deadline for claimant to file response to Request for Cure  11102/07 \n10  Court review of Claims Administrator's determinations rejecting  * \ndeficient claims \n* \nTo be determmed by Court at a later appropnate date. \nII.  PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE: \nOn April 25, 2000 Plaintiffs filed a Class Action Complaint against Orleans Parish Criminal \nSheriff Charles C. Foti, Jr., his wardens and deputies, seeking injunctive relief and damages pursuant \nto 42 USC §1983 and §1988 on behalf of those persons arrested for minor offenses only who were \nsubjected to strip andlor visual body cavity searches pursuant to an alleged unconstitutional blanket \npolicy, practice and custom of the Sheriffs Office. The Defendants assert that all such searches were \nperformed only to detect drugs, weapons, and other contraband in order to preserve the safety and \nlives of detainees, personnel and visitors at OPCSO.  The \"Recitals\" section of the Settlement \nAgreement sets forth in detail the various stages and events which have transpired in this litigation \nfor the past six years and is incorporated herein by reference. \nPage 6 of 29 \n\nDuring discovery and settlement negotiations, the size of the potentia! class became more \napparent. It was learned that possibly upwards of 80,000 potential class members were subjected to \nsome variation of a strip and/or visual body cavity search, depending upon when they were arrested \nand went through the intake procedures, with the number of incidents possibly exceeding 145,000 \nbecause of multiple arrests and bookings of some class members. \nClass Counsel retained a government finance expert to analyze the Sheriffs Office's fmances \nand budgets to determine the Office's ability to pay any judgment that might be rendered against it. \nii \nClass Counsel also considered the financial resources of the individual Defendants, should the case \nproceed to trial and judgment in favor of Class Members.  Class Counsel also looked to other strip \nsearch class action settlements around the country to determine the anticipated rate of response by \nputative class members following notice of the settlement, as well as the range of recovery deemed \nfair and reasonable by other courts in comparable cases.  Class Counsel conferred with plaintiffs' \nattorneys involved in those similar strip search class actions and confirmed that this settlement \ncomports with settlements which have been approved by other courts. \nDefendants asserted that the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's Office, as a public entity, was \ndependent for its revenues upon funds generated directly or indirectly, through taxes, bonds and fees, \nand that the financial resources of the OPCSO available to pay the claims of the Class/Sub-Classes \nwere greatly restricted due to the expenses associated with providing adequate housing, staffing, \nwelfare, and medical care for its prisoners. It also became apparent that there were other economic \npressures on the OPCSO, including reduced revenues, requiring it to resort to significant belt-\ntightening efforts. All counsel were aware that punitive damages are not available against the OPCSO \nas a matter oflaw, that a punitive damage award against the individuals would be meaningless, as the \nPage 7 of 29 \n\nindividual defendants' ability to pay any damages that might be awarded against them was highly \nunlikely to be within their means given the sheer number of these claims. \nIt was apparent that the defendants, a public entity and individual public employees, unlike \nmany large private businesses, did not have \"deep pockets\" and that there were also strong public \npolicy considerations regarding the continued economic viability of this public safety organization \nwhich had to be considered. All of these discussions and considerations and the agreement to settle \nthis case occurred before the events ofA  ugust 29, 2005 (pre-Katrina). Sufficient funds to implement \nthe settrement were set aside long before that disaster occurred.  It is obvious that, given current \nconditions, if this settlement were to fail, all oft he considerations mentioned above would be greatly \nmagnified and that the associated risks involved in this litigation for all parties have intensified. \nThe parties were in agreement that there were substantial risks and costs associated with \nproceeding to trial, and that a fair and reasonable settlement of this lawsuit was possible and \ndesireable for the benefit of all parties and in the interest of judicial economy. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT: \nThe Settlement Agreement recognizes that institutional reform was one oft he main purposes \nof this lawsuit and that institutional reform through injunctive relief has now been achieved.3  The \ndamages provided by the settlement reenforce and strengthen those interests.  The Defendants have \nmade arrangements to commit, and have committed, sufficient resources to enter into a settlement of \n'The parties spent many months researching and drafting alternatives to the OPCSO's \npolicies on strip and visual body cavity searches (the \"iottscan\" was one such alternative proposal \nthat was closely examined).  The Court ultimately issued three important orders of substantial \nbenefit to the injunctive class, providing for significant changes in the defendants' policies and \npractices. As a result of these orders, the OPCSO built 'privacy enclaves' for arrestees entering \ntheir facilities. For two years the plaintiffs monitored the practices at OPCSO to ensure that there \nwas compliance with the injunctive relief ordered by the Court. \nPage 8 of 29 \n\nthe plaintiffs' damages claims in this lawsuit, in the amount of $9,375,000, plus interest accruing \nsince June 2, 2004.  The parties believe that this sum represents a fair and reasonable settlement of \nthis matter that also serves to encourage and enhance the equitable injunctive relief obtained in this \nlawsuit. \nThe  parties  have  proposed  a  method  and  formula  for  computation  and  distribution \ncommensurate with those settlements that have been achieved around the country, which formula \nobviates the need for individualized hearings and which results in a fair and reasonable monetary \nrecovery for individual class members while also comporting with the settlements that have been \nachieved nationwide in substantially similar strip search class actions. All members of each Sub-class \nare treated the same. Each Sub-class is defined according to what happened to the individuals in each \nsub-class on certain dates.  Those dates, and the Sub-classes defined by them, were derived from \nchanges which were brought specifically about by this litigation resulting in modification of the \nOPCSO's policies and practices as the case progressed.  The estimated recovery for each Class \nMember is well within the range ofr ecovery deemed to be a fair and reasonable outcome in numerous \n4 \nsimilar cases around the country, while avoiding the necessity ofi ndividual hearings. In other similar \nstrip search class actions the settlement class is the rule rather than the exception. In fact, the parties \nare not aware of any strip search class action which has been resolved by a means other than \nsettlement after a class has been even provisionally certified for any kind of equitable or monetary \n4The Court cart ¥ce judicial notice of the fact that this case has been pending in excess of \nsix (6) years, with an ample record produced during the course of this litigation.  Yet, during this \nsame time-frame, other than the three individual claims of Greta Cazenave, Janet Densmore and \nBeth Ann Boatman, no other individual claims have been filed.  The parties are of the opinion \nthat had any other individuals incurred significant damages, those individuals would have, by this \ntime, pursued individual litigation on those claims. \nPage 9 of 29 \n\nrelief. The case law and the anecdotal research from other plaintiffs' class counsel similarly situated \nto this case shows that class members prefer a straight-forward resolution of their claims with a \ncertain monetary payout, without having to present specific proof of damages or file individual \nlawsuits.  See e.g., Foreman v. State o/Connecticut,' CA No. 3:01CV0061 (D. S. D.C. Conn. July \n31, 2006)(Fairness Hearing Opinion and Order of Class Action Settlement);  Miller  v. Mille  Lacs \nCounty, Minn.  No. 48-CV -052130 (7th  Judicial Dist., Minn., 2005); Brecher v. St. Croix County, \nWisconsin,2004 WL  1196982 (W.D.Wis. 2004); Maneely v.  City 0/ Newburg, 208 F.R.D. 69 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2002); Mack v.  Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass 2000); Eddleman v. Jefferson \nCounty, 96 Fed 3d 1448 (table) 1996 WL 495013 (6th Cir., Aug. 29, 1996)(unpublished opinion); \nDoan v. Watson, 2002 WL 31187073 (S.D. Ind., May 12, 2002); Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis., \n219 F.R.D. 607 (W.D. Wis. 2003).  All of these court approved class action settlements injail strip \nsearch. cases also involved use of grids, similar to that recommended by the parties herein, for \ncalculation of individual damages. \nThe parties submit that this settlement represents a reasonable and fair monetary settlement \nfor the remaining claims of the Class Members for the alleged violation oft heir constitutional rights, \n'The Fairness Hearing Opinion and Order issued by the Court in Foreman shows a $2.5 \nmillion dollar settlement was approved by the District Court. The damages to be paid to the \nplaintiffs in Foreman are to be determined based upon a per share distribution, much like the grid \nsystem proposed by this settlement. Class members in Foreman will receive their share after \ndeduction of the one-third approved attorneys' fees and costs and $20,000.00 payments to the \nthree named class representatives. \"The Claims Administrator will divide the amount remaining \nin the settlement fund (after the payments made as provided above) by the number of shares to \ndetermine the amount each participating class member will receive .... Class members will \nreceive only one payment no matter how many times they were admitted into and/or searched \nwhile incarcerated ...\"  Foreman v State o/Connecticut Settlement Agreement, filed July 20, \n2006, at p. 13. Notably, after notice and an opportuni1y to object and/or opt out, there were no \nopt-outs or objectors at the fairness hearing in Foreman. Analytics, Inc., the proposed \nadministrator for this case, was the court approved claims administrator in Foreman. \nPage 10 of 29 \n\nand for payment of attorneys fees, costs, expenses, expert and consultant fees, including the costs of \nnotice and administration, as is fully set forth in the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Fund will \nbe treated as a \"Qualified Settlement Fund\" within the meaning of Treasury Reg. Sec. 1.468-B-I \nunder this proposal. \nIt is respectfully suggested, in view of the record of these proceedings and all the premises \nmentioned herein, that the Class/Sub-Classes set forth below and in the Settlement Agreement be \nconditionally certified under Fed. R. Civ. P., Rule 23(b)(3) damage class. \nThe proposed settlement Class/Sub-Classes should be defined as follows: \nCLASS: Every person arrested only on \"minor offenses\" (as defmed below) \nwho entered the Orleans Parish jail's Intake and Processing Center (\"IPC\"), \noperated by the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's Office (OPCSO), during the \ntime periods set forth below, who was required to submit to any or all of the \nfollowing procedures, prior to his or her fust court appearance or release, \nwhichever came first, pursuant to a blanket policy, practice or custom of the \nOPCSO applicable to all arrestees to be admitted to the general population of \nthe jail: \nSub-Class A or the \"Kelly\" class: \n(A)  The removal orrearrangement ofs ome or all oft he arrestee's clothing, \nincluding undergarments, in the presence ofOPCSO deputies and/or \nother detainees, resulting in the exposure oft he arrestee's genital area, \nanus, buttocks, and/or breasts (in the case offemale arrestees) and the \nsubsequent visual inspection oft he arrestee's private parts by OPCSO \ndeputy or deputies, which occurred from April 25,  1999 :through \nFebruary 14,2002; \nSub-Class B or the \"Change-Out\" class: \n(B)  The removal  or rearrangement of some or all  of  the arrestee's \nclothing, including undergarments, in order to change into·OPCSO \nsupplied  garments  under  circumstances  which  allowed  OPCSO \ndeputies and/or other detainees the ability to view his or her genital \narea, anus, buttocks and/or (in the case of female arrestees) breasts, \nwhich occurred from February 15,2002 through May 31, 2002; \nPage 11 of 29 \n\nSub-Class C or the \"Contempt\" or \"Templeman III\" class: \n(C)  The removal or rearrangement of some or all of a male arrestee's \nclothing or clothing furnished by OPCSO including undergarments, in \nthe  presence  of OPCSO  deputies  and/or other detainees,  which \nresulted in the exposure of the arrestee's genital area, anus, and/or \nbuttocks to others in violation of the Court's Order of May 20,2002 \nas the arrestee was being admitted to the receiving tier at Templeman \nIII from the IPC which occurred from June 1, 2002 through May 31, \n2003. \nAs used herein \"minor offenses\" includes one  or more traffic offenses, \nmisdemeanors, petty offenses, or violations ofm  unicipal or parish ordinances, \nnone of which involves weapons or controlled dangerous substances.  This \ndefinition specifically excludes any and all felonies. \nAs used herein \"visual  inspection of an arrestee's private parts\" means \ninspection of the arrestees' genitalia, buttocks, anal cavity, vaginal cavity \nand/or female breasts by an OPCSO deputy or deputies. \nThe dates provided in the class definitions and these subclassifications are based upon the \nfollowing:  April 25, 1999 is the earliest prescriptive date for any claim in this case.  February 15, \n2002 is the effective date of the first Consent Decree entered by the Court which modified OPCSO's \nwritten strip and visual body cavity search policy and officially ended the practice and procedure of \nblanket visual body cavity searches. June 1, 2002 is the effective date of the second Consent Decree \nentered by the Court which modified OPCSO' s change-out procedure to require privacy booths. May \n31, 2003 is the last date of the Templeman III post-change out blanket strip searches.  Whether.an \nindividual qualifies as a Class member (and, if so, which Sub-class) will be based upon the records \nof the OPCSO; if the OPCSO records do not confirm that an individual fits within one of the Sub-\nClass definitions above, his or her claim will not be allowed. \nThe foregoing Class/Sub-classes have already been certified for the purposes of injunctive \nreliefunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b)(2). The initial focus of this lawsuit was institutional reform in the \nPage 12 of 29 \n\nform of injunctive relief to stop the policies and practices of the defendants at issue, to prevent the \ndefendants from reinstating said policies and practices, and to deter the defendants and others from \npursuing such policies and practices. These purposes have already been achieved. The parties submit \nthat the amount of the Fed. R. Civ. P 23(b )(3) damages negotiated between the parties for the. \nClass/Sub-class members is fair and reasonable under the totality of the circumstances of this \nlitigation.  The parties assert that the proposed settlement provides for a mathematical computation \nand distribution of those damages to Class Members which is fair, reasonable and equitable and, as \ncontemplated by the settlement, is well within the range of comparable strip search settlements which \nhave been approved by other courts, and provides a fair remedy to each Class/Sub-class member \nwithout the risk of wide disparities in outcome on liability or varying damages if separate trials were \nordered for the thousands of individual claims. This settlement allows the Class/Sub-class members \nto recover for their damages through a predictable and certain administrative process without having \nto submit to the humiliation of having to relive the incident in public or the burden of presenting \nindividualized proof of damages. \nAfter the deduction of attorneys fees, costs, expenses, expert and consultant fees, all costs of \nnotice and administration (including the Claims Administrator's fees and expenses), and the incentive \nawards to the Class Representatives, each Class Member will receive a share of the remaining \nSettlement Fund in accordance with the distribution formula set forth in the Settlement Agreement \nafter submission, review and approval of the supporting documents required thereby. The proposed \nSettlement Agreement also contemplates that all injunctive relief and other mandates outstanding and \nalready ruled upon and ordered in these proceedings will be confIrmed in the final judgment and made \nPage 13 of 29 \n\npermanent, and that the Defendants will continue to comply with the Consent Decrees which have \nalready been entered and made the law of this case. \nPreliminary approval requires only a finding that the settlement falls within the range of \npossible approval, meaning primarily that the settlement was reached as a result of arms-length \nnegotiations and after sufficient discovery was conducted.  Here, both those requirements are \nsatisfied. Investigation, discovery and motion practice proceeded for over three years before serious \nsettlement negotiations on the damages claims even commenced.  The settlement negotiations \nthemselves were extensive and adversarial and were conducted, off-and-on, over a nine (9) month \nperiod (September 2003  through May 2004).  The fmancial resources of all Defendants were \nexamined and determined to be severely restricted in comparison with the potential number of claims. \nThe negotiations were conducted by experienced and knowledgeable civil rights counsel, with the \nhelp of appropriate expert advice.  Class representatives personally attended the mediation and \nactively participated in the settlement negotiations. Through such participation, they became aware \nof the financial limitations which could practically constrain any theoretical monetary award and the \nlikely range of recovery by the Class/Sub-class members if the proposed settlement is not approved. \nThe Court can take judicial notice, from its prior and extensive experience with overseeing \nlitigation against the OPCSO and its deputies, wardens and employees for many years, of the unique \nchallenges involved in litigating against the OPCSO, that the OPCSO has many pressing needs for \nits financial resources and that the settlement contemplated herein represents a serious and significant \ncommitment by the OPCSO to fairly satisfy the claims of the Class/Sub-Classes. For those reasons \nand the reasons set forth in the legal argument below, the parties respectfully urge the Court to enter \nits Preliminary Order of Approval in the form submitted herewith. \nPage 14 of 29 \n\nIV.  LEGAL SUPPORT: \nA.  CERTIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT UNDER FED. R. \nCIV.  P.  23(b)(3)  IS  APPROPRIATE  TO  RESOLVE  ALL  MONETARY \nCLAIMS AGAINST DEFENDANTS. \nThe Court has already determined (and the Defendants have stipulated) that this case \nmeets the criteria for class action certification under Rule 23(a).  (See Record, Doc. No. 36 --Joint \nStipulation for Purposes of Class Certification Only, entered: 03/23/2001). The Court has recognized \nthat this group of plaintiffs is \"homogenous and cohesive\" with few conflicting interests among its \nmembers when it certified the 23(b) (2) injunctive class on January 14, 2002. (See Record, Doc. No. \n54 - Joint Consent Decree for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, entered 01/15/02). \nOn September 19,2002, the Court certified a Rule 23(c )(4 ) class \"as to liability only.\" \n(See Record, Doc. No. 70, entered 09/19/02).  The remaining question for this Court and the parties \nwas what was required to resolve any potential damage claims.  In that framework, the Court urged \nsettlement negotiations and ordered mediation.  A settlement was finally reached in May of 2004, \nestablishing a settlement fund for monetary relief for Class Members. \nWithout question, there is a strong judicial policy favoring the resolution of disputes \nthrough settlement.

The District Court  relied on the Fifth Circuit's \ndecision in Reed v General Motors Corp, 703 F.2d 170, 172  (5th Cir. 1983), in which that Court \naffirmed a class action settlement and stated that in order for a district court to make a determination, \nthere are \"six focal facets\" to consider: \n(I) the existence of fraud or collusion behind the settlement; (2) the complexity, \nexpense, and likely duration of the litigation; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the \namount ofd iscovery completed; (4) the probability ofp laintiffs' success on the merits; \n(5) the range of possible recovery; and (6) the opinions of the class counsel, class \nrepresentatives and absent class members. \nTower Loan, 216 F.R.D. at 352 - 53, quoting Reed v General Motors Corp, 703 F.2d 170, 172 (5th \nCir. 1983). \nPage 16 of 29 \n\nThe Fifth Circuit reiterated and emphasized in Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d \n402, 408 (5th  Cir.  1998), that \"the district court maintains substantial discretion in determining \nwhether to certify a class action, a decision ... review[ ed] only for abuse.\"  The case law also \nemphasizes that courts should take into consideration that \"settlement is a compromise, [and] a \nyielding oft he highest hopes in exchange for certainty and resolution.\" In re General Motors Pick-up \nTruck Fuel Tank Litigation, 55 F.3d 768, 806 (3d Cir. 1995). See also In re Shell Oil Refinery, 155 \nF.R.D. 552, 560 (B.D. La. 1993)( court should consider the vagaries of litigation and compare the \nsignificance of immediate recovery by way of the compromise to the mere possibility of relief, after \nprotracted and expensive litigation.) \nThe settlement in this case readily meets the Reed criteria.  Certainly, the extent and \nduration oft his case do not suggest collusion or abuse oft he process, but rather manifest a protracted, \narms-length adversarial process, and a fair and reasonable result for the Class  Members.  See also \n2 Newberg & Conte, Newberg on Class Actions, § 11.41 (3d ed. 1998)(\"There is usually an initial \npresumption of fairness when a proposed settlement, which was negotiated at arm's length by counsel \nfor the class is presented for Court approval\"); Manual for Complex Litigation, §30.42 (3d ed. \n1995(ibid.); In re A.H Robbins, 880 F.2d 709,752 (4th Cir. 1989)(class counsel aggressively pursued \nthe action); Meyer v.  Citizens and Southern National Bank, 677 F. Supp. 1196, 1201 (M.D. Ga. \n1988)(\"class had been extremely hard fought from the very beginning\").  Note too, the cases warn \nthat the court must be mindful not to \"try\" the case at the settlement stage as \"the very purpose of a \ncompromise is to avoid the delay and expense of such a trial.\" Reed v. General Motors, 703 F.3d at \n172, citing Young v. Katz, 447 F.2d 431, 433 (5th Cir. 1971). \nPage 17 of 29 \n\nClass Counsel's efforts to date resulted in significant institutional refonn in the fonn \nof injunctive relief, which stopped the policies and practices oft he Defendants at issue. The proposed \nsettlement will ensure that all of that relief will remain in effect. The significant monetary relief also \nprovided by the Settlement Agreement is sufficient to deter both the Defendants and others from \npursuing such unconstitutional policies or practices in the future. \nA number of other federal district courts have certified strip search class action \nsettlements where it is alleged that a political subdivision employed a blanket strip search policy. See, \ne.g., Blihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D. 602 (W.o. Wis. 2003); Brecher v. St. Croix County, \nWisconsin, 2004 WL  1196982 (W.D.Wis. 2004); Mack v.  Suffolk County Co.,  191  F.R.D.  16 \n(D.Mass. 2000); Doan v.  Watson,  2002 WL 31730917 (S.D. Ind. 2002); Eddleman v.

See generally Plaintiff s Response to Court Order \n(Record Doc. No. 129, filed February 23,2005) containing an extensive survey of additional strip \nsearch cases from throughout the country.  Since that time, there have been decisions in other cases \napproving strip search class action settlements in addition to those previously cited.  See Foreman \nv.  State of Connecticut, CA No. 3:01CY0061 (U.S.D.C. Conn. July 31, 2006)(Fairness Hearing \nOpinion and Order of Class Action Settlement); McBean v. City ofN  ew York, 228 F.R.D. 487, 502 \n(S.D.N.Y.  2005)(class  certified  for  inmates  subjected  to  blanket  policy  of post-arraignment \nmisdemeanor arrestee intake strip searches and court indicated it would preliminarily approve \nsettlement previously proposed if a motion to do so were renewed);  Miller v. Mille  Lacs County, \nMinn.  No. 48-CY-052130 (7th  Judicial Dist., Minn., 2005); Nilsen v. York County, 382 F.Supp.2d \n206 (D.Me. 2005); Smook v. Minnehaha County, 340 F.Supp.2d 1037 (D.S.C. 2004)(damages class \nPage 18 of 29 \n\ncertified where policy of suspicionless strip searches of all juveniles admitted to facility regardless \nof offense or reasonable suspicion was not justified; qualified immunity denied).  The parties also \nanticipate that the payouts to individual Class Members in this case will be in line with the amounts \nrecovered by class members in similar litigation in other jurisdictions. \nCertification of the Class/Sub-classes at this time under Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 23(b)(3) \na \nto add  monetary fund in addition to the extensive equitable relief is appropriate and has been \napproved by the Class Representatives.  The monetary relief contemplated by this settlement is \npremised upon the predominating and common issues of the blanket searches which took place \npursuant to policies, procedures and practices of the OPCDO during the defmed class periods. The \ndamages serve the important functions of deterring future bad acts by Defendants and others and \nproviding compensation for damages for the constitutional violations and injuries suffered by the \nClass Members. The Class/Sub-class members will have a predictable and certain recovery with this \nsettlement without further delay, which in itself is a very valuable asset. \nThe monetary settlement also provides for relief to the Plaintiffs by being a significant \nenough sum to deter the Defendants and any others who might otherwise be inclined to pursue a \nsimilar path of violating detainees' rights through blanket strip and/or visual body cavity searches. \nThe Plaintiffs have a significant interest in insuring that their accomplishments in this case are not \ntransitory and that the important constitutional interests at stake are protected and guarded from future \nintrusions. \nThe fact that money has already been set aside in the Settlement Fund strengthens the \nguarantees provided by the equitable relief.  The settlement recognizes the monetary value assigned \nto the constitutional violations at issue, the injuries suffered by the Class/Sub-Class members, and \nPage 19 of 29 \n\nalso the important deterrent value of a monetary payment which strengthens the enforcement of the \nother relief already achieved here. \nThe grid in this Settlement Agreement does not require the Class Members to provide \nSUbjective statements of how they may have been injured, which they may be disinclined to do in a \n. public forum.  Instead, each Class/Sub-class member will be entitled to a damage amount as defined. \nby the settlement grid and each will get this payout through a simple administrative procedure, rather \nthan through further protracted litigation and public exposure. \nMoreover, this case has been pending for more than six (6) years now and the parties \nbelieve that had there been other claims for individual damages beyond those already filed, those \nindividuals would most probably have already come forward.  If a significant individual damage \nclaim existed, it is likely that individual would have contacted Plaintiffs' Class Counselor hired \nseparate individual counsel to pursue any such significant individual damage claim. The parties know \nof no such individual claim or lawsuits for damages other than those that have already been resolved. \nThe damage payments will be received by the Class/Sub-class members through a simple, straight \nforward administration process provided by the Settlement Agreement and thus provide the Class \nMembers with predictable, certain, defined, and prompt relief, which is also an important element in \nthe reasonableness and fairness of the resolution of this dispute. \nShould this settlement not be approved as recommended by the parties, and the case \nproceeds, there would be the prospect of an adverse class determination which could result in tens \noft housands of individual suits fordarriages against the OPCSO and individual defendants who could \nnot financially withstand the jUdgments awarded against them, thereby sparking a \"race to the court-\nhouse,\" \"first-come/first-served\" scramble for a limited pot of money which would be quickly \nPage 20 of 29 \n\ndepleted in an arbitrary fashion among only some claimants.  Even a favorable class determination \nachieved as a result oflitigation could be subject to appeals that could take years to resolve and could \npossibly be reversed or modified on appeal, delaying the fmal resolution of this matter even further. \nThe Rule 23(b)(3) damages Settlement Fund has already been established,6 and \nprovides each claimant a secure monetary recovery for their damages within a reasonable time period \nthrough an efficient and timely process. This settlement also provides the Defendants with the ability \nto direct their attention and efforts to carrying out the essential public services provided by the \nOPCSO. rather than continuing to divert resources to defending and litigating this case.  The \nsettlement is also of sufficient magnitude to provide a deterrent to other public officers and entities \nwho may be otherwise inclined or predisposed to violate the constitutional and civil rights ofp ersons \nwho have been arrested only on minor charges by subjecting them to blanket strip and/or visual body \ncavity searches. \nIn particular, the Settlement Agreement recognizes that the individuals sUbjected to \nthe conduct at issue in this lawsuit are those who likely would not be able to find attorneys to \nrepresent them individually because oft he limited size and nature oft he potential individual recovery. \nPursuant to the class action process and this settlement, all these individuals are provided with the \nability to obtain prompt monetary relief for the violation of their rights through a predictable, certain \nand defined relief, from an already established Settlement Fund, through the relatively easy claims \nprocess.  By contrast, individual litigation of these claims carries with it uncertainty, risk and costs \n60n Oct. 4, 2005 the Court issued an order permitting the OPCSO to borrow the sums of \nmoney in the fund in response to the emergency conditions which existed following the \nHurricane Katrina disaster, and setting forth the terms for handling and restoration of those sums. \n(Doc. No. 144).  As per the Court's Order all sums were returned to the Settlement Fund by \nOctober 6, 2006, with interest. \nPage 21 of 29 \n\nto the Plaintiffs and Defendants alike, and provides no guarantee that individuals WQuld obtain \njudgments, much less recover any damages at the conclusion of the litigation process. It also makes \nsense for one court to resolve both the injunctive and damages issues. As noted by the Fifth Circuit \nin In  re  Monumental Life: \"Indeed, interests of judicial economy are best served by resolving \nplaintiffs' claims for injunctive and monetary relieftogether.\" Id, 365 F.3d 480, 417-18 \nThe 23 (b)(3) damage certification provides a mechanism to aggregate claims and \npermit both compensation and deterrence that are otherwise impossible, relieving the judicial burdens \nthat would be caused by repeated adjudication oft he same issues in thousands ofindividualized trials \nagainst the OPCSO, the individual Defendants and perhaps other personnel of the OPCSO.  A \nfundamental aim of class actions is '''to promote judicial economy and efficiency by obviating the \nneed for multiple adjudications of the same issues ...\"  5 Moore's Federal Practice § 23.02 (3d \ned.1998), citing General Tel. Co. ofS outhwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982) and American \nPipe & Constr. Co. v.  Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 553 (1974).  See also Garyv. Sheahan, 1999 WL 281347 \n(N.D.

NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SHOULD \nBE PRESENTED TO THE PROSPECTIVE CLASS MEMBERS. \nPart of the Court's function is \"to ascertain whether there is any reason to notify the \nclass members of the proposed settlement and to proceed with a fairness hearing.\"  Prudential, 163 \nF;R.D. at 209, quotingArmstrongv. Board ofSch. Directors, 616 F.2d 305, 314 (7th Cir. 1980). The \nPage 22 of 29 \n\nprocedure of providing notice to the class followed by a fairness hearing to consider approval of the \nclass settlement has been accepted by numerous courts and is now standard practice.  Prudential, \nsupra; Bronson v. Board ofE duc., 604 F. Supp. 68 (S.D. Ohio 1984). The court in Bronson outlined \nthe following procedures for preliminary approval of a class action settlement:  \"The court must \npreliminarily approve the proposed settlement; then, members of the class must be given notice of \nthe proposed settlement and after a hearing the court must decide whether the proposed settlement \nis  fair, reasonable and adequate.\" Id.  at 71.  The Manual for Complex Litigation affirms this \nrecommended procedure.  It states:  :1 \nA two step process is followed when considering class settlements. \nFirst, the court makes a preliminary evaluation of the fairness of the \nsettlement ... If the proposed settlement appears to be the product of \nserious,  informed,  non-collusive  negotiations,  has  no  obvious \ndeficiencies, does not improperly grant preferential treatment to class \nrepresentatives or segments of the class, and falls within the range of \npossible approval, then the court should direct that notice be given to \nthe class members ofa  formal fairness hearing, at which evidence may \nbe presented in support of and in opposition to the settlement. \nManual for Complex Litigation, Third (Fed. Judicial Center 1995) §30.41. \nAuthorization to disseminate notice reflects a recognition by the Court only that the \nsettlement is in the range of possible approval; the ultimate determination is reserved pending the \ncompletion of the notice process so the Court can consider input from the class members who will \nbe bound by the final  approval order.  See In re Baldwin-United Corp.,  105 F.R.D. 475, 485 \n(S.D.N. Y. 1984) (court authorized provisional class certification and notice \"without prejudice to the \nfindings the Court will make after conducting the fairness hearing, at which time all objections or \narguments in opposition to the proposed settlements will be heard and considered and proponents \nPage 23 of 29 \n\nmust  discharge their burden to  prove  that the proposed settlement  agreements  are  fair  and \nreasonable\"). \nWhether the settlement falls within the range ofp ossible approval under Rule 23 turns \nupon whether there is a conceivable basis for presuming that the more rigorous standard applied for \nfinal approval will be satisfied.  The standard for final approval of a settlement consists of showing \nthat the settlement is \"fair, reasonable and adequate\" (Weinberger, 698 F.2d at 73), considering \"the \ncomplexity oft he litigation, comparison oft he proposed settlement with the likely result oflitigation, \nexperience of class counsel, scope of discovery preceding settlement, and the ability oft he defendant \nto satisfy a greater judgment.\"  In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, 960 F.2d 285, 293 (2d Cir. \n1992). In the absence of fraud, collusion or the like, the court should not substitute its own judgment \nfor that of counsel.  Weinberger, supra.  See also Triefv . Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 840 F. Supp. 277, \n281 (S.D.N. Y. 1993) (\"absent evidence of fraud or overreaching [courts] consistently have refused \nto act as Monday morning quarterbacks in evaluating the judgment of counsel\"); Berenson Co.  v. \nFaneuil Hall Market Place, 671 F. Supp. 819,822 (D. Mass 1987) (\"[w]here, as here, a proposed \nsettlement has been reached after meaningful discovery, after arm's length negotiation, conducted by \ncapable counsel, it is presumptively fair. \") Preliminary approval is not a definitive fmal fmding on \nthe fairness of the proposed settlement, and permitting notice to members of the class does not mean \nthat the court has found the settlement to be fair, reasonable, and adequate for purposes of final \napproval, but simply allows the parties to proceed with notice and a fairness hearing.  SeeHolden v. \nBurlington Northern, 655 F. Supp. 1398 (D. Minn. 1987). \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), class members are entitled to notice of any proposed \nsettlement before it is finally approved by the court. Manualfor Complex Litigation, Third (1995) \nPage 24 of 29 \n\n§30.212.  Under Rule 23(e) and due process, adequate notice must be given to all absent class \nmembers and potential class members to enable them to make an intelligent choice as to the fairness \nand reasonableness of the settlement. The Supreme Court has held that Rule 23 and due process do \nnot require delivery of actual notice to every class member, but rather that \"notice reasonably certain \nto reach most of those interested in objecting is likely to safeguard the interests of alL\"  Phillips \nPetroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797 (1985).  \"It is well-settled that in the usual situation first class \nmail and publication fully satisfy the notice requirements ofF  ed. R. Civ.

Y. 1981) (\"individual notice by  s \nfirst class mail, coupled with notice by publication satisfies the requirements of due process and Rule \n23\"). \nIn this case, the Settlement Agreement proposes notice of the settlement to be sent to \nall potential Class Members by mailing the Class Action Notice (Long Form) and Proof of Claim and \nRelease to the individual's last known address, verified where possible through a national locator \nservice. There will be a follow-up mailing for any notice that is returned as undeliverable, if another \nviable address can be found through using a national locator database or service and whatever \nadditional post-Katrina address locator resources are available and accessible.  Defendants have \nalready provided Class Counsel and the Claims Administrator with data in electronic form containing \nthe name, last known address, birth date, social security number and unique OPCSO identifier \nnumber, as well as other pertinent information for each Class Member. \nMedia publication of notice will include, but is not necessarily limited to, publication of a \nnotice designed to comply with due process and in a form substantially similar to the Class Action \nPage 25 of 29 \n\nNotice (Short Form), attached as Exhibit Bl. The media notice will include media publication, to the \nextent required by due process, in New Orleans and in other major metropolitan areas identified as \nhaving significant numbers oft he New Orleans area population post-Katrina and will be printed and \npublished on a date(s) to be set by the Court.  The Claims Administrator and Class Counsel will \ndevelop and provide the CoUrt with an appropriate notice plan deemed appropriate and consistent \nwith the requirements of due process. The Class Action Notice (Short Form), Exhibit Bland the \nClass Action Notice (Long Form), Exhibit B, will also be published and posted on the internet. Any \nadditional media notice will either be coordinated with Defendants' counsel as to its form, content \nand placement location, or shall be ordered by the Court. \nMoreover, the Claims Administrator will also provide a free copy oft he Notices (Short \nand Long Form) and Proof of Claim and Release to anyone who requests these documents.  The \nClaims Administrator will be available for contact through a mailing address, a dedicated internet \nwebsite and a toll-free telephone number, to provide further information to the Class/Sub-Classes. \nClass Members will be notified that they have the right to be excluded (i.e., opt out) \nfrom the settlement and may request to do so. In order to be excluded, a written Request for Exclusion \nas described in the Settlement Agreement must be received by the Claims Administrator by the date \nspecified by the Court and copies furnished to counsel for the parties. Also, if a Class/Sub-class \nmember wishes to appear at the Fairness Hearing in support ofh is or her request for exclusion, notice \nof intention to appear must be timely received by the Claims Administrator in writing and served on \ncounsel of record for the parties. \nPage 26 of 29 \n\nAt the Fairness Hearing, the Court will consider on the timeliness and validity of all \nRequests for Exclusion.  Should anyone or more Class/Sub-Class Members file a Request for \nExclusion which is found by the Court to be timely and valid, then the Criminal Sheriff in office at \nthe time of such ruling may elect to withdraw from the Settlement Agreement. Should the Criminal \nSheriff elect to withdraw, this Settlement Agreement shall be null and void, with full reservation of \nall rights of all parties. \nThose persons wishing to object to any aspect of the settlement must file a written \nobjection setting forth the basis to support the objection and supported by any such documents or case \nlaw upon which he or she intends to rely to support the objection. Any such objection and supporting \ndocuments must be timely received by the Claims Administrator with a copy provided to Plaintiffs' \nClass Counsel and Defense Counsel, at the addresses provided herein.  Also, if a Class/Sub-class \nmember wishes to appear, either in support of his or her objection or in support of the settlement, \nnotice of intention to appear must be timely received by the Claims Administrator  in writing and \nserved on counsel of record so all such objections and appearances can be docketed and addressed \nat the fairness hearing. \nThe parties believe these procedures fully satisfY the requirements ofd ue process and \nRule 23, and recommend approval by the Court. \nC.

ET AL \nDefendants  JUDGE JAY C. ZAINEY \nMAGISTRATE SECTION 5 \nMAGISTRATE ALMA L. CHASEZ \nPROPOSED ORDER OF PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS \nACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nThis Court having duly considered the Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class \nAction Settlement Agreement and Memorandum in Support thereof, together with the Class Action \nSettlement Agreement and supporting materials; and the Court being informed that the Plaintiffs, \nJeff Brite, William Brice White III, Lionel Nelson, George Wurz, Anthony Pogorzelski, Kendra \nSpencer, Tony Buchen, and Sylvia Brown, appearing herein as Class Representatives and the \nDefendants, Charles C. Foti, Jr., in his individual capacity, Wardens BarbaraAcomb, William Short, \nJoseph Howard, John LaCour, Gary Bordelon, and Chief Rudy Belisle, each in their individual and \n1 \n\nofficial capacities, and Marlin N. Gusman, in his official capacity only as the present Crirrrinal \nSheriff of Orleans Parish,' appearing by and through their undersigned counsel, have entered into \na Class Action Settlement Agreement (\"Settlement Agreement\") intended to resolve the litigation \nin the above numbered and entitled proceeding with a proposed settlement and dismissal. All of the \nsearches complained of occurred during the administration of former Criminal Sheriff Charles C. \nFoti, Jr.  Sheriff Gusman enters into the Settlement Agreement only in his official capacity as the \npresent Criminal Sheriff, in order to carry into effect the obligations of settlement oft his case which \nare the legal obligations oft he OPCSO because they were agreed to by his predecessors in office and \nbecame binding on the Sheriff's Office prior to Sheriff Gusman's election as Sheriff. \nAfter due consideration of applicable law and the proceedings in this case; \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this Motion is GRANTED and that the Class Action \nSettlement Agreement is hereby APPROVED by the Court, and ADOPTED herein in all its terms \nand conditions, subject to the following: \nI.  The Settlement Agreement is hereby preliminarily approved, subject to further \nconsideration thereof at the fairness  hearing provided for herein.  The Court finds  that said \nSettlement Agreement is sufficiently within the range of reasonableness and that notice of this \nproposed class action settlement should be given as provided in this Order and as set forth in detail \nin the Settlement Agreement. \nSheriff Marlin N. Gusman appears herein in his official capacity only for the purposes \n1 \nset forth. below (he is sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively with the named defendants as \n\"Defendants\" only to include his office (the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's Office, \"OPCSO\") \nas an entity obligated under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. \n2 \n\n2.  Pursuant to  Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  Rule 23, the Court reaffirms the previous \ncertification of the Class/Sub-Classes under Fed. R.  Civ. P. 23(b)(2) for injunctive relief and \nreaffirms all previous orders issued by the Court relative to the injunctive and other relief sought and \nobtained in these proceedings. \n3.  The Court preliminarily finds that the 23(b) (2) injunctive class achieved \ninstitutional reform in the form of injunctive relief, to stop the policies, practices, and searches at \nissue herein which were previously in effect at OPCSO, to prevent the OPCSO from reinstating said \npolicies, practices, and searches, and to deter the OPCSO and others from pursuing such policies, \npractices, and searches; and that the monetary relief provided for by the Settlement Agreement under \n23(b) (3) is fair and reasonable under the circumstances oft his case. This settlement is supported by \nother strip search class action damage settlement classes certified in federal court circuits around the \ncountry.  (See, Doc. No. 129, filed February 23,2005 - Research return to Court on issues relating \nto other class actions settlements nationwide; see also, Joint Memorandum in Support of Class \nAction Settlement and cases cited therein). \n4.  The Court fmds that, as a matter oflaw, punitive damages are not available \nagainst a public entity such as the OPCSO and are potentially available in this lawsuit only against \nthe individual defendants sued in their individual capacity pursuant to 42 USC §1983.  The Court \nfurther preliminarily finds that the ability of the individual defendants to pay damages in this \nlitigation as awarded in a judgment is highly unlikely to be within their means in comparison to the \nnumber of potential claims by class members. \n5.  The Court finds that the OPCSO is a public entity, dependent upon funds \ngenerated mostly from the public, directly or indirectly, through taxes, bonds and fees; that the needs \n3 \n\nof the OPCSO for these funds are great; that the financial resources available to the OPCSO to pay \nthe claims of the Class/Sub-Classes are greatly restricted due to the expenses associated with \nproviding adequate housing, staffing, welfare, and medical care for its prisoners, in comparison with \nthe number of potential claims by class members; and that the interests of the plaintiffs and class \nmembers to recover damages against the defendants in their official capacities is required to be \nreasonably and fairly balanced against the significant public interest involved in insuring the viability \nof the continued operations of the duties and functions of the OPCSO. \n6.  Additionally, the Court makes  a preliminary finding  that the proposed \nsettlement provides for a mathematical formula for the calculation and distribution ofm  onetary relief \n2 \nto Class Members which is  fair, reasonable and equitable and, as contemplated by the settlement, \nis well within the range of comparable strip search settlements which have been approved by other \ncourts. \n7.  Accordingly, the Court finds that this class action meets the criteria for \ncertification under Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) as a damage class and certifies the class and sub-classes \nas  set out below and in the  Settlement Agreement (hereafter referred to collectively as  the \n\"Class/Sub-Classes\"): \nCLASS: Every person arrested only on \"minor offenses\" (as defined below) \n.w  ho  entered the Intake and Processing Center (\"IPC\") operated by the \nOrleans Parish Criminal Sheriffs Office (\"OPCSO\"), during the time periods \nset forth below, who was required to submit to any or all of the following \nprocedures, prior to his or her first court appearance or release, whichever \ncame first, pursuant to a blanket policy, practice or custom of the OPCSO \napplicable to all arrestees to be admitted to the general population of the jail: \n2Unless the context otherwise requires, \"Class Member\" shall mean a putative or actual \nmember of any of the Sub-classes now or hereafter certified in this case. \n4 \n\nSub-Class \"A\" (or the \"Kelly\" class): \n(A)  The removal or rearrangement of some or all \noft he arrestee's clothing, including undergarments, in \nthe  presence  of OPCSO  deputies  and/or  other  jj  \ndetainees, resulting in the exposure of the arrestee's \ngenital area, anus, buttocks, and/or breasts (in the case \nof  female  arrestees)  and  the  subsequent  visual \ninspection of the arrestee's private parts by OPCSO \ndeputy or deputies, which occurred from April 25, \n1999 through February 14, 2002; \nSub-Class \"B\" (or the \"Change-Out\" class): \n(B)  The removal or rearrangement of some or all \nof the arrestee's clothing, including undergarments, \nin order to change into OPCSO supplied garments \nunder circumstances which allowed OPCSO deputies \nand/or other detainees the ability to view his or her \ngenital area, anus, buttocks and/or (in the case of \nfemale  arrestees)  breasts,  which  occurred  from \nFebruary 15,2002 through May 31, 2002; \nSub-Class \"C\" (or the \"Contempt\" or \"Templeman III\" class): \n(C)  The removal or rearrangement of some or all \nofa male arrestee's clothing or clothing furnished by \nOPCSO including undergarments, in the presence of \nOPCSO  deputies  and/or  other  detainees,  which \nresulted in the exposure of the arrestee's genital area, \nanus, and/or buttocks to others in violation of the \nCourt's Order of May 20, 2002 as the arrestee was \nbeing admitted to the receiving tier at Templeman III \nfrom the IPC, which occurred from June  1, 2002 \nthrough May 31, 2003. \nAs used herein \"minor offenses\" includes one or more traffic offenses, \nmisdemeanors,  petty  offenses,  or  violations  of municipal  or  parish \nordinances,  none  of which  involves  weapons  or controiled  dangerous \nsubstances. This definition specifically excludes any and all felonies. \n5 \n\nAs used herein \"visual inspection of the arrestee's private parts\" means \ninspection of the arrestees' genitalia, buttocks, anal cavity, vaginal cavity \nand/or female breasts by an OPCSO deputy or deputies. \nWhether or not an individual qualifies as a Class Member will be based upon \nthe records of the OPCSO; if the OPCSO records do not confinn that the individual fits within one \nof the Sub-Class definitions above, his or her claim will not be allowed. \n8.  The  Court has been advised that on September 24, 2004,  the OPCSO \ndeposited the sum of Nine Million Three Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars and No/l OOths \n($9,375,000.00) together with interest earned thereon since June 2, 2004, into an interest bearing \naccount entitled \"Orleans Parish Strip Search Settlement Fund\" (hereafter referred to  as  the \n\"Settlement Fund\") with Hibernia National Bank (hereafter referred to as the Escrow Agent).  The \nterms  of the Settlement Agreement shall govern this  Settlement Fund and are adopted and \nincorporated herein. On October 4,2005 the Court issued an order permitting the OPCSO to borrow \nthe sums of money in the Settlement Fund in response to the emergency conditions which existed \nfollowing the Hurricane Katrina disaster (Docket No.  144).  That order set forth the terms for \nhandling and restoration of those sums, and OPCSO returned to the Settlement Fund the sums \nborrowed on October 4, 2006, including interest earned, as per the Court's order. OPCSO complied \nwith all of the terms of the Court's order for the handling and restoration ofthe Settlement Fund. \n9.  The Court finds that the Plaintiffs, Jeff Brite, William Brice White III, Lionel \nNelson, George Wurz, Anthony Pogorzelski, Kendra Spencer, Tony Buchen, and Sylvia Brown are \nadequate class representatives for the Class/Sub-classes certified herein and are confirmed as such \nand reappointed herein.  The Plaintiffs'  request for incentive awards to the individual class \nrepresentatives varying from $5,000.00 to $20,000.00 per person based upon the individual class \n6 \n\nrepresentative's involvement and participation in representing the Class/Sub-classes in this litigation \nshall be heard at the fairness hearing set herein. \n10.  The Court further finds that Plaintiffs' Counsel, Samuel S. Dalton (LSBA# \n4473), Mary E. Howell (LSBA# 7030), D. Majeeda Snead (LSBA# 15052), and Christina R. L. \nNorris (LSBA# 14270) are adequate Class Counsel, are confirmed as such and reappointed as Class \nCounsel to enforce and implement the Settlement Agreement approved herein. \nII.  The Court finds that SheriffM  arlin N. Gusman, as Criminal Sheriff of Orleans \nParish, has the legal obligation, created by his predecessors prior to his tenure as Criminal Sheriff, \nas well as full authority as Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish, to execute the Settlement Agreement \nand that the obligations of settlement created prior to Sheriff Gusman's tenure, by his predecessors \nin office, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement, are binding not only on Sheriff Gusman as \nCriminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish, but on all successor Criminal Sheriffs as welL \n12.  The Court finds that this case has been vigorously litigated by the parties for \nmore than six (6) years and that Plaintiffs actively monitored the operations of the OPCSO relative \nto strip and visual body cavity searches for over two (2) years pursuant to orders of this Court; that \nthe injunctive relief obtained by Plaintiffs has substantially altered the policies, practices and \nprocedures of the OPCSO; that the sum to be paid by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs' Class/Sub \nclasses for the Plaintiffs damages is a fair and reasonable sum, and that the proposed settlement is \nin the best interest of all parties. \n13.  The Court approves written notice in a form substantially similar to the Class \nAction Notice (Long-Form) and the Class Action Notice (Short-Form) attached to the Settlement \nAgreement as Exhibits B and B-1, respectively.  The Court finds that the Notices are accurate, \n7 \n\nobjective, informative and provide the Class Members with all oft he information necessary to make \nan informed decision regarding participation in the settlement, the terms of the settlement and its \nfairness.  The Court further approves the Proof of Claim and Release (\"Proof of Claim\") attached \nto the Settlement Agreement as Exhibit C.  The Court also approves the notice plan as set forth in \nthe Settlement Agreement. \n14.  Defendants are ordered to provide whatever timely assistance is necessary and \nfeasible to accommodate and facilitate a reasonable and cost-effective administration oft he proposed \nsettlement. \n15.  The Court takes note that defendants have already provided Class Counsel \nand the Claims Administrator with sufficient and adequate information, including a useable data base \ncontaining pertinent information, such as name, address, phone number, Social Security number, \ndate of birth, J.D. number, OPCSO unique identifier number, folder number, date of arrest, offenses \ncharged, booking date, location/transfer information, and date and time of first court appearance or \nrelease, of every Class Member, in order to facilitate efforts to identify and locate Class Members \nand to confirm arrest, booking, location, transfer and first court appearance or release information, \nincluding dates and times of such events. \n16.  The Court approves Class Counsel's retention of Analytics, Inc. as claims \nadministrator and disbursing agent (hereinafter referred to as the \"Claims Administrator\") in \naccordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement and this Order. \n17.  Beginning no later than ____,  2007, Class Counsel shall cause Notice \nto be disseminated in the manner set forth in the Settlement Agreement and as advised by the Claims \nAdministrator.  Prior to the fairness hearing, the Claims Administrator shall serve and file a sworn \n8 \n\nstatement attesting to compliance with this paragraph.

CHASEZ \n**************************** \nCONSENT DECREE \nFOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF ONLY \nIT IS HEREBY STIPULATED by and between the undersigned counsel for \nplaintiffs and defendants, as follows: \n1.  On April 25, 2000, Plaintiffs filed a Class Action Complaint in the above-\ncaptioned matter seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys fees, and costs \nagainst Sheriff Charles C. Foti, Jr., in his personal and official capacities as Criminal \n1 \nDATE OF ENTRY \nJAN 1 5 Z002 \n\nSheriff for the Parish of Orleans.1 Said Complaint also named as defendants various \nOrleans Parish Criminal Sheriffs Office (OPCSO) wardens and deputies and alleged an \nunlawful policy, practice and custom of routinely authorizing and performing strip and \nvisual body cavity searches on persons arrested only for minor offenses and detained \npending the posting of bond, without reasonable suspicion that the person is carrying \nweapons or contraband. \n2.  The plaintiffs' lawsuit makes claims on behalf of three named plaintiffs \nand a class of persons similarly situated  for violation of his or her civil rights to be free \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments and right to privacy under the Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the Constitution of the United States, all in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The \nplaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the OPCSO policy on its face and as applied. \n3.  The parties do not dispute the certification of the injunctive class \npursuant to F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2). Accordingly, plaintiff's class for declaratory and injunctive \nrelief is hereby deemed certified under F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) only. \n4.  Discovery has been conducted by both parties. In order to put an end to \nthis phase of the litigation and to avoid unnecessary expense and the uncertainties of \nfuture litigation regarding the injunctive phase, the Sheriff, his agents, assigns, \nemployees, deputies and successors are hereby ordered to adopt and enforce the \nlIn their complaint, plaintiffs also seek compensatory and punitive damages for the named \nplaintiffs and the class they seek to represent. The issue regarding the appropriateness of \ncertification of the damage class pursuant to F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3) is contested and has been \nsubmitted to the Court for decision. This consent decree regarding injunctive and declaratory \nrelief is entirely separate from the damage claim and is solely concerned with the injunctive class \npursuant to F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2). \n2 \n\npolicy and form attached hereto as Attachment A and B and incorporated herein, to \nsubmit to the jurisdiction of the Court regarding the implementation and enforcement of \nAttachments A and B and to designate plaintiffs' counsel as prevailing parties on this \nissue only (for purposes of attorneys fees and costs), all as more fully set forth \nhereinbelow. \n5.  The parties, with the oversight and assistance of the U.S. Magistrate \nJudge, have agreed to the adoption and implementation of a new written policy \nregarding these searches which passes constitutional muster. \n6.  It is agreed that defendant Charles C. Foti, the Criminal Sheriff of Orleans \nParish,  will establish, implement and enforce the policy, practices and procedures as \nset forth in Attachments A and B, incorporated herein, as to all arrestees charged only \nwith minor offenses who are awaiting his or her initial court appearance. Said Sheriff, \nhis agents, assigns, employees, deputies and successors are hereby permanently \nenjoined from enforcing any policies, practices or procedures as to said arrestees which \nare in contravention to those set forth in Attachments A and B. \n7.  It is further agreed that within 30 days of the date of entry of this decree, \nthe provisions of this decree will be disseminated to all employees of the Orleans Parish \nCriminal Sheriff's Office, will be fully implemented by that time and defendants will \nfurnish this Court and plaintiffs' counsel written confirmation of same. \n8.  Implementation of this Decree shall be monitored for one year following \nthe entry date herein.  On the first day of every month (or the next business day, if the \nfirst falls on a holiday or weekend) defendants shall provide plaintiffs counsel with the \nbooking information on twenty (20) individuals (15 men and 5 women), picked at \n3 \n\nrandom, who were arrested the preceding month for minor offenses only as defined in \nAttachment A and were placed in custody of the OPCSO.  Defendants will also furnish \nto plaintiffs' counsel copies of the booking records and strip search records related to \nany strip and/or visual body cavity search conducted on an arrestee charged with only \nminor offenses, within 7 days of the search. The monitoring period may be extended by \nthe parties mutual agreement, in writing, or by Order of the Court, upon good cause \nshown. \n9.  The parties to this Consent Decree may modify any of its terms upon \nmutual agreement, in writing, and with approval of the Court.  Either party may also \napply to the Court for modification of this Consent Decree, upon legal cause shown. \n10.  The parties to this Consent Decree agree that the provisions herein \nfully and fairly accommodate the interests of the parties hereto regarding the issue of \ninjunctive and declaratory relief in this matter, that this Court should adopt and approve \nthis Consent Decree and that this Consent Decree is a full and final judgment between \nthe parties with regard to permanent injunctive and declaratory relief only. \n11 . The parties agree that plaintiffs have substantially prevailed on the merits \nwith respect to their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. All remaining claims are \nreserved by plaintiffs and denied by defendants. Plaintiffs will submit an itemization of \nreasonable attorneys fees and costs to defendants counsel no later than 15 days after \nthe Court's entry of this order.  Defendants shall provide a response to plaintiffs' \nsubmission within 15 days. If the parties are unable to agree on attorneys fees and \ncosts within 10 days of plaintiffs' counsel's receipt of defendants' response, the matter \nshall be submitted to the Magistrate Judge for decision.  Fees and costs related to \n4 \n\n-------------------\nmonitoring shall be submitted to defendants' counsel no later than 30 days following the \nexpiration of the monitoring period. If agreement cannot be reached, the matter shall be \nsubmitted to the Magistrate Judge for decision. \n12.

Upon approval of the Court, as provided below, the Clerk is requested to \nenter this Consent Decree in the official docket. \nWHEREFORE, having fully read and considered the provisions set forth in the \nabove Consent Decree, plaintiffs and defendants having stipulated and agreed to the \nabove terms, and the Court having approved the entry of this decree, IT IS SO \nORDERED. \nI: \n~&~, \nNEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, this  {hday of  2002. \n.

PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY \nThe purpose of this policy is to provide deputies with guidelines for determining if \nand under what conditions the use of strip searches of new arrestees charged only with \nminor offenses, is legally permissible and to establish guidelines for the appropriate \nconduct of such searches. It applies to all arrestees charged only with minor offenses, \nuntil after their first court appearance, if they are not ordered to be released or post \nbond. \n2.  POLICY \nThe Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriffs Office (OPCSO) recognizes that the use of \nstrip searches may, under certain conditions, be necessary to protect the safety of \ndeputies, civilians and other prisoners; to detect and secure evidence of criminal \nactivity; and to safeguard the security, safety and related interests of OPCSO's prisoner \ndetention and holding facilities.  It is the policy of the OPCSO that such searches shall \nbe conducted only with proper authority and justification and in accordance with the \nprocedural guidelines for conducting such searches as set forth in this policy. \n3.  DEFINITIONS \nStrip Search: Any search of an individual requiring the removal or rearrangement \nof some or all of the individual's clothing which permits the visual inspection of his or \nher genital areas, anus, breasts and/or buttocks. \n4.  PROCEDURES \nA.  Individuals arrested only for a minor offense, including a \nmisdemeanor not involving weapons or controlled dangerous \nsubstances, or a traffic offense, petty offense or violation of a city \nor parish ordinance, shall not be subject to strip searches unless \nthe deputy has articulable, reasonable suspicion to believe that the \nindividual is concealing contraband or weapons.  Factors to \nconsider in establishing individualized, reasonable suspicion may \ninclude but are not limited to the following: \n1.  The nature of the offense charged. \n2.  The arrestee's appearance and demeanor. \n3.  The circumstances surrounding the arrest. \n1 \n\n4.  The arrestee's criminal record, particularly past \ncrimes of violence and narcotics offenses. \n5.  The discovery of evidence of a major offense in plain \nview or in the course of a search incident to the \narrest. \n6.  The detection of suspicious objects beneath the \nsuspect's clothing during a field search incident to \narrest. \n7.  Reliable information received \n8.  Positive response from a metal or drug detector \ndevice that is properly calibrated, properly operated \nand that uses scientifically accepted and reliable \nmethodology. In order to reduce the possibility of \nfalse or misleading reports, if there is a positive \nresponse from a walk-through metal detector, the \ndeputy shall use a hand-held metal detector for \nverification purposes before considering the propriety \nof a strip search. If there is a positive response from a \ndrug detection device, the deputy shall perform a \nsecond test for verification purposes before \nconsidering the propriety of a strip search. \nB.  Where articulable, reasonable suspicion exists to conduct a strip \nsearch, the deputy shall make a written request, including the date \nand time of the request, to the supervisor of the detention facility or \nother deSignated authority that clearly defines the basis for \nsuspicion. The supervisor or other designated authority will either \napprove or disapprove the request, in writing, stating the date and \ntime of his or her response. \nc.  When authorized by the supervisor or other designated authority, \nstrip searches may be conducted only as follows: \n1.  By specifically trained personnel. \n2.  By the fewest number of personnel necessary and only by \nthose of the same sex. \n3.  Under conditions that provide privacy from all but those \nauthorized to conduct the search. \nD.  Following a strip search, the deputy performing the search shall \nsubmit a written report to the supervisor or other designated \nauthority that details, at a minimum, the following: \n1.  Date, time and place of the search. \n2.  Name and rank of the deputy(s) conducting the search. \n2 \n\n3.  Name, date of birth and folder number of the arrestee \nsearched. \n4.  Name and rank of supervisor who approved search \n5.  Name and position of all those present during the search. \n6.  A detailed description of the nature and extent of the search. \n7.  Any weapons, evidence or contraband found during the \nsearch. \n8.  If weapons, evidence or contraband is found as a result of \nthe search, date and time of notification to supervisor and \nmedical department and identities of those notified \nE.  If during a strip search the deputy visually observes an object \ninside a body cavity that the deputy reasonably believes is a \nweapon or contraband, the deputy shall monitor the prisoner and \nalert the supervisor or designated authority who authorized the \nsearch and the OPCSO medical department. \nF.

No. 144) and the Order entered October 26, \n2006 (Record, Doc. No. 150). \n2The original plaintiffs and class representatives were Greta Cazenave, Jeff Brite and \nWilliam Brice White, III.. On November 24, 2003, additional class representatives were named, \ni.e., Lionel Nelson, George Wurz, Anthony Pogorzelski, Kendra Spencer, Tony Buchen and \nSylvia Brown. (Doc. No. 102).  Greta Cazenave was dismissed as a Class Representative on \nDecember 15,2003 and was allowed by the Court to withdraw from these proceedings on May \n17,2004. (Doc. No. 120).  Greta Cazenave is no longer a Plaintiff or a Class Representative in \nthese proceedings.  Janet Densmore was named in the Original Complaint as one of the Plaintiffs \nbut was removed as a Plaintiff and Class Representative, on May 9, 2000, preserving her right to \nproceed in CA 00-1268, by order of Judge Morey Sear. (Doc. No.3). \n1 \n\nRepresentatives on behalfo  fa ll oft he class members, as defined herein, and the Defendants, Charles \nC.

Gusman in his official capacity only as the present Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish , \nappearing by and through their respective counsel, hereby enter into the following Class Action \nSettlement Agreement (\"Settlement Agreement\") pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth \nbelow and subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. \nAll of the policies, practices, and searches at issue herein occurred under the administration \nofformer Criminal Sheriff Charles C. Foti, Jr. SheriffG  usman enters into the Settlement Agreement \nonly in his official capacity as the present Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish, in order to carry into \neffect the obligations of settlement of this case which are the legal obligations oft he OPCSO because \nthey were agreed to by his predecessors in office and became binding on the Sheriff's Office prior \nto Sheriff Gusman's election as Sheriff. \nRECITALS \n3SheriffMariin N. Gusman appears herein in his official capacity only for the purposes \nset forth below (he is sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively with the named defendants as \n\"Defendants\" only to include his office (the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's Office, the \n\"OPCSO\") as an entity obligated under the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  Defendant \nCharles C. Foti, Jr. was named in the Original and Amended Complaints as a Defendant \nindividually and officially, in his capacity as the Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish. \nSubsequently Defendant Foti resigned as Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish, and on January 26, \n2004, William C. Hunter, as Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish, inherited the litigation and as \nsuch was substituted for Charles C. Foti, Jr., in his official capacity only.  Marlin N. Gusman was \nsubsequently elected as Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish, took office on November 14, 2004 \nand inherited this litigation, and as such is substituted for William C. Hunter in his official \ncapacity only, as the current Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish. Charles C. Foti, Jr. remains a \nDefendant in these proceedings, individually (Doc. No. 110).  William C. Hunter is no longer a \nDefendant in any capacity. \n2 \n\nA.  Plaintiffs' Original and Amended Complaints (Doc. Nos. 1 and 2) allege violations \nofthe First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. §I983, 42 USC §1988, and also violations of the laws and constitution ofthe State of \nLouisiana regarding a blanket policy and practice of the OPCSO of blanket strip and visual body \ncavity searches by OPCSO deputies of persons arrested for minor offenses only, not involving \nweapons or drugs, who were processed through the Intake and Processing Center (\"IPC\") of the \nOrleans Parish jail and transferred into general population, prior to their first court appearance, \nwithout a determination of reasonable, individualized suspicion that the individual was concealing \nweapons or drugs. These searches resulted in the exposure of the arrestees' private parts (genitalia, \nbuttocks, anal cavity, vaginal cavity and/or female breasts) to  OPCSO deputies and/or other \ndetainees and, in the event of visual body cavity searches, to actual visual inspection of those private \nparts by OPCSO deputies in the presence of others of the same sex. \nB.  The OPCSO is the law enforcement office for Orleans Parish, Louisiana, which \noperates the Orleans Parish jail under the control, direction and supervision ofthe Orleans Parish \nCriminal Sheriff, who is the OPCSO's final policymaker. The searches at issue in this lawsuit were \nconducted by individuals acting in the course and scope of their employment by OPCSO and under \ncolor of state law. \nC.  Defendants deny that they have done anything wrong whatsoever, deny all liability \nto the Class/Sub-classes defined herein, and do not concede any infirmity in the defenses that they \nhave asserted or intend to assert in these proceedings.  The individual defendants deny ever \npersonally conducting any strip searches.  Defendants assert that all searches were performed only \n3 \n\nto detect drugs, weapons and other contraband in order to preserve the safety and lives of detainees, \npersonnel and visitors at OPCSO. \nD.  The parties have stipulated to the following facts, which are not in dispute in this \nmatter: \n1.  On April  25,  2000,  the  Original  Complaint was  filed.  The Amended \nComplaint was filed on May 16,2000. On July 25, 2000, the plaintiffs filed \na Motion to Certify Class, and the parties began pre-trial discovery. \n2.  On March 21,200 I, the parties entered into Joint Stipulations conceding that, \nif certified, this lawsuit met all the prerequisites for certification as a class \naction as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (a), including numerosity, typicality, \ncommonality, and adequacy of representation.  (Doc. No. 36). \n3.  On January II, 2002, the parties entered into a Consent Decree, approved by \nthe Court, by which an injunctive class was certified pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP.  23(b)(2), and a new Strip Search Policy and Arrestee Strip Log was \nadopted by the  OPCSO  which was  in compliance  with constitutional \nstandards.  The parties also agreed to continued monitoring by Plaintiffs' \ncounsel (hereafter referred to as \"Class Counsel\") for purposes of insuring \nimplementation of the new policies and procedures.  (Doc. No. 54). \n4.  On May 16, 2002, the parties entered into a Joint Supplemental Consent \nDecree, approved  by the Court, regarding the \"Change-out\" procedure, \ngranting further injunctive relief whereby the Defendants agreed to stop the \nblanket \"change-outs\" from  street clothes to jail uniforms of arrestees \n4 \n\ncharged with minor offenses only, and further agreed to construct privacy \nbooths to allow these arrestees to change their clothes in private without \nscrutiny or exposure of their private parts to others.  (Doc. No. 62). \n5.  On September 19, 2002, the parties agreed to the certification of two sub \nclasses, for liability only, pursuantto Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (c)( 4), as follows: (1) \nthose arrestees charged with minor offenses only, not involving weapons or \ncontrolled dangerous substances who, prior to their first court appearance, \nwere subjected to a strip and visual body cavity inspection (a/k/a Sub-class \nA or the \"Kelly Class,\" pursuant to Kelly v Foti, 85 F.3d 627 (5th Cir 1996)); \nand (2) those arrestees charged with minor offenses only, not involving \nweapons or controlled dangerous substances who, prior to their first court \nappearance,  were  required  to  disrobe  in  the  presence  of  others  in \ncircumstances which exposed their private parts to the view of others (a/kJa \nSub-class B or the \"Change-Out Class\").  (Doc. No. 70). \n6.  On January 3, 2003, the Court issued a Judgment, pursuant to the consent of \nthe parties and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4), certifying a class of individuals, for \nliability only, based upon the definitions of the two (2) Sub-classes indicated \nabove.  (Doc. No. 71). \n7.  On April 22, 2003, the parties entered into a Joint Stipulation of Findings of \nFact regarding Sub-class A - the \"Kelly\" Class.  This Stipulation provided, \nin pertinent part, the following with regard to the policies and practices oft he \nOPCSO of performing blanket strip and visual body cavity searches on \n5 \n\narrestees  charged only with minor  offenses  not  involving weapons  or \ncontrolled dangerous substances, prior to their first court appearance, from \nApril 25, 1999 through at least January 1,2001. (Doc. No. 77): \na.  Arrestees charged with minor offenses only are processed through the \nOPCSO by first going through its Intake and Processing Center \n(\"IPC\"), where they are booked.  As a general rule, arrestees cannot \nbe released until the booking process is completed, which usually \ntakes several hours.  During the booking process, arrestees have \naccess to telephones and bail bond agencies to make arrangements for \nrelease on bail.  Shortly after booking is completed, the arrestees are \ntransferred into the general population of the jail, to designated tiers. \nFrequently bailor a release order is already in place or in progress \nprior to the arrestee's transfer to general population. Manyarrestees \ncharged only with minor offenses are released on bond or a release \norder  shortly  after  they  have  been  transferred  to  the  general \npopulation of the jail, before their initial court appearance. \nb.  A strip search required the mandatory removal of the  arrestee's \nclothing until he or she was naked and subject to inspection by \nOPCSO deputies of the same sex and others present in the room, all \nof the same sex.  A visual body cavity search required the arrestee to \nbend over, spread his or her butt cheeks and cough, thereby exposing \nprivate body cavities such as the anus and, in the case of females, \n6 \n\nvaginal cavity, for inspection. Female members of Sub-Class A were \nfrequently required to squat and cough while naked.  Large breasted \nwomen were required to lift their breasts.  Male members of Sub \nClass A were required to move their testicles to facilitate the searches. \nc.  Sub-Class A members were subjected to these mandatory blanket \nstrip  and  visual  body  cavity searches  in the  presence  of other \ndetainees, all of whom were the same sex, as were the deputies who \nwere performing the searches. \nd.  Male trustees, also known as \"Yanks\" (prisoners already in custody \nof the OPCSO who were not members of Sub-Class A and who had \nspecial privileges and responsibilities in the jail as trustees), were \nfrequently present during the strip and visual body cavity searches of \nthe male members of Sub-Class A. \ne.  The strip and visual body cavity searches of Sub-Class A members as \ndescribed herein took place as the result of a mandatory, blanket \npolicy and practice. At the time these searches were conducted, there \nwas no prior or contemporaneous, individualized inquiry made to \ndetermine whether there was any articulable, reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that any individual Sub-Class A class member was concealing \ncontraband or weapons on their persons. \n7 \n\n8.  On May 6, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \non the Issue of Liability Only on behalf of Sub-Class A (a/k/a the \"Kelly\" \nClass).  (Doc. No. 81).  Defendants opposed this Motion. (Doc. No. 88). \n9.  The parties subsequently entered into a Joint Stipulation of Findings of Fact \nRegarding Sub-Class B, which reflected that members of Sub-Class B (the \n\"Change-Out\" class) went through the same general booking and disrobing \nprocedure as members of Sub-Class A as described herein, with the exception \nthat members of Sub-Class B were not subject to a visual body cavity search \nby deputies.  (Exhibit A to Doc. 85).  Before members of Sub-Class B were \ntransferred to general population from IPC, they were required to remove \nsome or all oft heir clothing, including undergarments, in order to change into \nOPCSO supplied garments under circumstances which allowed OPCSO \ndeputies of the same sex and other detainees of the same sex the ability to \nview the arrestees' genital area, anus, buttocks and/or in the case of female \narrestees, breasts.  This procedure was called a \"change-out.\" \n10.  On June 26, 2003, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Contempt (Doc. No. 84) \nagainst defendants SheriffFoti and Warden Bordelon alleging violation oft he \nCourt's consent decrees described above (Docs. Nos. 54 and 62) regarding \nthe blanket practice of Warden Bordelon of requiring male arrestees charged \nonly with minor offenses, prior to their first court appearance, to strip naked \nand to expose their private parts to the view ofm  ale deputies and other males, \n8 \n\nupon transfer from the IPC to the receiving tier of Templeman III (an OPCSO \nmale detention facility), after having changed into jail-issued clothing. \n11.  On June 27,  2003,  the  Plaintiffs  filed  a  Motion for  Partial  Summary \nJudgment on the Issue of Liability Only on behalf of Sub-Class B (a/kJa the \n\"Change-out\" Class).  (Doc. No. 85).  Defendants opposed this Motion. \n(Doc. No. 95). \n12.  On September 5, 2003, in a letter agreement, signed by Defendant Sheriff \nF oti, and approved and entered by the Court, the parties agreed to resolve \nPlaintiffs' Motion for Contempt described above in ~ 10. (Doc. No. 84). The \nsettlement terms are set forth in detail in that letter agreement, but in general \nthe agreement provided that the OPCSO would take all necessary and proper \nsteps to ensure that future violations oft he Consent Decrees or related orders \nof the  Court do  not occur,  that  OPCSO  wardens,  deputies  and  other \nemployees would comply with the letter and the spirit of the injunctive relief \nprovided in the above Consent Decrees, and that the OPCSO would ensure \nthe implementation ofn ew policies adopted as ordered by the Court, pursuant \nto this litigation.  It further provided that the OPCSO would develop and \nimplement training programs for OPCSO wardens, deputies and employees. \n(See Doc. No. 98, annexed to letter agreement). \n13.  In addition, on September 5, 2003, the parties joined in a Stipulated Amended \nClass Definition, approved and ordered by the Court, to certify Sub-Class C \nin this proceeding (a/kJa the \"Contempt\" or \"Templeman III\" Class), as to \n9 \n\nliability only.  (Doc. No. 98).  The parties also annexed to the Definition a \nJoint Stipulation of Findings of Fact providing, in pertinent part: \n'-j \na.  Numerous male arrestees charged only with minor offenses, prior to \ntheir first court appearance and after having changed into OPCSO \nsupplied  clothing  (post-\"change-out\")  were  transferred  to  the \n1 \n11 \n:! \nreceiving tier of Templeman III, a detention facility operated by the \nIi \nOPCSO.  At the time of their transfer into Templeman III, many of \nthese arrestees were required to remove or rearrange some or all of \ntheir clothing, including the jail supplied uniforms into which they \nhad previously been required to change, under circumstances which \nallowed OPCSO male deputies and other male detainees the ability \nto  view the arrestees'  genital area,  anus  and/or buttocks.  This \nprocedure was for the sole purpose of searching the arrestee before \nbeing  received  into  the  holding  facilities  or receiving  tiers  of \nTempleman III. This procedure took place both prior to and after the \nentry of the consent decrees of January 15,2002 and May 20, 2002. \nb.  The procedure described in the previous paragraph was generally \napplied to all male arrestees transferred to Templeman III whenever \nadequate personnel were available to perform it.  The number of \narrestees on minor offenses only who underwent this procedure since \nApril 25, 1999, cannot be exactly determined but the computerized \nrecords of the OPCSO reflect that the number of persons who \n10 \n\nunderwent this procedure from March 5, 2003 through May 30, 2003, \nis approximately 6,043. \nc.  Male trustees, also known as \"Yanks\" (prisoners already in custody \nof the OPCSO who were not members of any of the Sub-Classes \nherein),  were  sometimes  present  during  the  post-\"change-out\" \nblanket procedure described above involving male members of Sub \nClass C. \nd.  The post-\"change-out\" procedure involving members of Sub-Class C \nas described herein was a mandatory, blanket practice or custom of \nWarden Bordelon, the Warden of Templeman III and a supervisory \nemployee of Sheriff Foti, and of the OPCSO, which was in effect \nsince April 25, 1999, which applied to all arrestees transferred to the \nreceiving tier of Templeman III. \ne.  The  blanket,  post-\"change-out\"  procedure  described  herein  of \narrestees entering Templeman III took place at the direction and \npursuant to the orders of Warden Bordelon, a named defendant in this \nlawsuit, who was, at all pertinent times herein, Chief of Security for \nthe OPCSO, warden of Templeman III and a supervisory employee \nof Sheriff Foti, and of the OPCSO. \nf.  At the time the post-\"change-out\"procedures at Templeman III were \nconducted  on members  of Sub-Class  C,  there  was  no  prior or \ncontemporaneous, individualized inquiry made to determine whether \n11 \n\nthere was any articulable, reasonable suspicion to believe that any \nindividual member of Sub-Class C was concealing contraband or \nweapons on their persons. \n14.  On August 21,2003, the parties appeared at a status conference with the \nCourt and agreed to explore the possibilities of settlement.  (Doc. No. 97). \nThe contempt matter was resolved on August 21, 2003 by agreement of the \nparties and an Order of the Court reflecting that agreement was entered on \nSept 9, 2003.  (Doc. No. 98). \n15.  From  August through November  2003,  the parties  conducted  regular, \nmultiple,  multi-hour settlement meetings and discussions, but were unable \nto resolve their dispute.  During this period Plaintiffs had access to fmancial \nrecords  of the OPCSO and advice and consultation from  an expert in \ngovernment finances  to  determine the ability of the OPCSO to  pay a \njudgment in this matter. \n16.  On March 29, 2004, the parties withdrew all their pending motions, reserving \nthe right to re-urge same (Doc. No. 112), and on April 22, 2004, the parties \nwere ordered by the Court to participate in mediation.  (Doc. No. 118). \n17.  On May 18,2004, after two full days of Court-ordered mediation (preceded \nby separate meetings with the court-appointed mediator), the parties agreed \nto settle this matter for the amount of $9,375,000.00 (Nine Million Three \nHundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars and Noll OOths) plus interest from \nJune 2, 2004, and to propose a joint settlement agreement to the Court for \n12 \n\napproval.  Subsequent to the parties having agreed on the general terms for \nsettlement of this litigation, the parties engaged in numerous meetings, Court \nconferences, document drafting sessions, and other efforts to  bring this \nsettlement to completion. A status hearing on the settlement was scheduled \nwith the Court on August 29,2005, the same day Hurricane Katrina hit New \nOrleans.  Obviously, Hurricane Katrina and its devastating impact upon the \nCity of New Orleans put that status hearing and the entire case on hold. \nShortly after the City was devastated, Sheriff Gusman filed a motion with the \nCourt seeking a temporary loan and transfer of the money already set aside \nin a Settlement Fund in the event these funds might have to be used to assist \nwith post-storm recovery efforts.  Class Counsel opposed this Motion.  The \nCourt held an evidentiary hearing on the Sheriff's motion via telephone, as \nNew Orleans counsel  and the Court were  displaced as  a result of the \naftermath of Katrina. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court granted the \nSheriff's motion and set conditions for the temporary (one year) loan to the \nSheriff's Office, with which the Sheriff complied.  As it turned out, the \nSheriff did not have to use this Settlement Fund and at the end of the one year \nperiod, the money was returned, with interest earned.  Since that time the \nparties have renewed their efforts to conclude this matter, have continued to \nmeet separately and with the Court, and are now in a position to move \nforward to finally resolve this lawsuit. \n13 \n\n18.  The  parties  agree that  one  of the main purposes  of this  lawsuit  was \ninstitutional reform in the form of injunctive relief, to stop the policies and \npractices at issue herein of the OPCSO at issue, to prevent the OPCSO from \nreinstating said policies and practices and to deter the OPCSO and others \nfrom pursuing such policies and practices. The monetary relief provided for \nby this Settlement Agreement is appropriate here because the Class/Sub-Class \nMember's claims for damages are premised upon the predominating common \nissues of the blanket visual body cavity, change-out, and contemptuous strip \nsearches policies and procedures of the OPCSO during the class periods \ndefined herein.  There is no danger that individual variations in the type or \nmagnitude of damage suffered by individual class members will affect \npredominance as the class representatives have the same type of damages and \nseek the same type of relief as members of the proposed class would be \nseeking.  The parties submit that there is no need for individual calculation \nof damages and that separate damage suits by individual class members are \nnot necessary. This case has been pending before the Court in excess of six \n(6) years.  The parties believe that had there been claims for individual \ndamages  beyond  those  which  have  been  experienced  by  the  class \nrepresentatives, by this time those individuals would have either contacted \nPlaintiffs' Class Counsel to pursue individual claims on their behalf, or \nwould have hired separate individual lawyers to do so. To the knowledge of \nthe parties, other than individual suits which have already been concluded, \n14 \n\nthere are no  individual lawsuits for damages' pending or contemplated, \nrelating to the issues involved in this class action litigation. The parties \nsubmit that the monetary relief herein grants the class members predictable, \ncertain, defined, and prompt relief, which is also a reasonable and fair \nresolution of this dispute. The settlement of the damages claims as provided \nby this settlement also provides the Court with a defined administrative \nprocedure to assure due process to each individual claimant, including the \nright to \"opt out.\"  By contrast, if this 23(b)(3) class action settlement were \nnot approved by the Court, the class representatives and the proposed class \nmembers would not be able to vindicate their rights because: (a)  many \nindividuals would not risk a second public humiliation by having to testify \nabout their arrest and strip search in a public judicial forum; and (b) even if \nindividuals  agreed to  subject themselves to relating  such  intimate and \nembarrassing details in a public forum, there is always a risk of receiving a \nlesser damage award or none at all in separate, individual trials.  Moreover, \nthis settlement would relieve this Court of the judicial burdens that would be \ncaused  by  repeated  adjudications  of the  same  issues  in  thousands  of \nindividual trials against these defendants. \n19.  The parties accept as a matter oflaw that punitive damages are not available \nagainst the OPCSO as a public entity and are potentially available in this \nlawsuit only against the  individual defendants  sued in their individual \ncapacity pursuant to 42 USC §1983. \n15 \n\n20.  The individual defendants have submitted personal financial statements, in \ncamera, to the Court, and, pursuant to a Protective Order, to Class Counsel. \nPlaintiffs, being aware oft he financial resources oft he individual defendants, \nare agreed that the ability of the individual defendants to pay damages in this \nlitigation as awarded in a judgment is highly unlikely to be within their means \nin comparison to the number of potential claims by class members. \n21.  The parties acknowledge that the OPCSO is a public entity, dependent upon \nfunds generated mostly from taxpayers, directly and indirectly, through taxes, \nbonds, and fees; that the needs of the OPCSO for these funds are great; that \nthe financial resources available to the OPCSO to pay the damages in this \nlitigation are greatly restricted due to the expenses associated with providing \nadequate housing,  staffing,  welfare  and medical  care  for  prisoners,  in \ncomparison with the number of potential claims by class members; that the \ninterests oft he plaintiffs to recover damages against these defendants in their \nofficial  capacities  must  be  reasonably  and  fairly  balanced  against the \nsignificant public interest involved in insuring the viability of the continued \noperations of the duties and functions of the OPCSO. \n22.  The parties agree that this settlement provides for a mathematical formula for \ncomputation and distribution of monetary relief to Class/Sub-class members \nwhich  is  fair,  reasonable  and  equitable  and,  as  contemplated  in ihls \nsettlement, is well within the range of comparable strip search settlements \nwhich have been approved by other courts. \n16 \n\n23.  The parties submit that this class action meets the criteria of Fed. R. Civ. P. \nRule 23(b) (3) with monetary relief, notice and the opportunity to opt out. \nThe questions of law and fact are common to the members of the class and \nthese questions predominate over questions affecting the individual members. \nAlso, the parties agree that the class action is the superior method for the fair \nand efficient adjudication of the controversy. \n24.  The parties agree that Sheriff Marlin N. Gusman, as Criminal Sheriff of \nOrleans Parish, has the legal obligation, created by his predecessors prior to \nhis tenure as Criminal Sheriff, as well as full authority as Criminal Sheriff of \nOrleans Parish, to execute this Settlement Agreement and that the obligations \nof settlement created prior to Sheriff Gusman's tenure, by his predecessors \nin office, as set forth in this Settlement Agreement, are binding not only on \nSheriff Gusman as Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish, but on all successor \nCriminal Sheriffs as well. \n25.  The parties agree that this case has been vigorously litigated  by the parties \nfor ove r  six  (6)  years;  and that Class  Counsel  actively monitored  the \noperations of the OPCSO relative to strip and visual body cavity searches for \nover two years pursuant to Orders of this Court. \n26.  The  parties  agree  that  the  injunctive  relief obtained  by  Plaintiffs  has \nsubstantially altered the policies, practices and procedures of the OPCSO. \n27.  The parties agree that the sum to be paid to the Class/Sub-Classes as \nmonetary relief is a  fair  and reasonable sum,  and that this  Settlement \n17 \n\nAgreement is in the best interest of all parties.  The parties have researched \nand examined other, similar cases around the country and find that the \namount of the Settlement Fund established in this case is comparable with \nthose cases.  It is also anticipated that the pay-outs to individual Class \nMembers will be in line with the amounts recovered by class members in \nsimilar litigation in other jurisdictions. Class Counsel have conferred with, \nand had the benefit of advice from, attorneys around the United States who \nhave litigated and settled similar strip search class actions. It should also be \nnoted that this settlement was achieved in the context of significant budgetary \nconcerns at OPCSO. It is also submitted that, similarly with the experience \nof other cases ofthis nature around the country, Class Members would prefer \nto have a quick resolution of their claims with a certain monetary payout \nwithout delay and without having to present specific proof of damages. \n28.  The parties agree and stipulate that plaintiffs' counsel typically represent \nplaintiffs in federal civil rights litigation with forty percent (40%) contingent \nfee agreements. Class Counsel assert that a contingency fee equal to the sum \nof thirty-seven (37%) percent of the Settlement Fund (Plus interest on such \nattorneys' fees, costs and expenses at the same rate and for the same periods \nas  earned  by  the  Settlement  Fund),  constitutes  fair  and  reasonable \ncompensation for Class Counsel given the magnitude oft he work performed, \nthe investment of heretofore uncompensated time by Class Counsel over the \ncourse of over six (6) years, the risks involved in the litigation, and the \n18 \n\nconsiderable investment of time and energy required to finally complete this \nmatter,  especially  given  the  intervening  effects  of Hurricane  Katrina. \nDefendants do not contest this fee and submit that it is reasonable.  It is \nfurther agreed that, in the event that Plaintiffs have to incur any additional \nattorneys fees and costs to seek enforcement or collection of this Settlement \nAgreement against Defendants because of a default by any Defendant in the \ntimely payment or performance of any Defendant's obligations under the \nSettlement Agreement, the Defendants acknowledge that plaintiffs have \nsubstantially prevailed on the merits, and that Defendants will be responsible \nfor payment of reasonable attorneys fees and costs to plaintiffs, as approved \nby the Court, pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 and § 1988 for those additional \nenforcement and/or collection efforts.  The Defendants reserve all other \ndefenses to any such claim for additional attorneys fees and costs. \n29.  Defendants agree to provide whatever timely assistance and information is \nnecessary and feasible to accommodate and facilitate a reasonable and cost-\neffective administration oft his settlement. The OPCSO has already provided \nto Class Counsel and the Claims Administrator a useable data base containing \npertinent information, such as name, address, Social Security number, date \nof birth, LD. number, OPCSO unique identifier number, folder number, date \nof arrest, offenses charged, booking date, location/transfer information and \ndate and time of first court appearance or release, of every Class/Sub-Class \nmember, in order to facilitate efforts to identify and locate class members and \n19 \n\nto confirm arrest, booking, location, transfer and first court appearance or \nrelease information, including dates and times of such events.  The parties \nagree to take all reasonable and appropriate steps to minimize costs and fees \nassociated with implementation of this Settlement Agreement. \n30.  If the parties are unable to agree to the appropriate distribution of any sums \nwhich, for whatever reason, remain in the Settlement Fund after completion \nof the distribution plan, the parties specifically reserve that issue for decision \nby the Court at a later date, when it becomes appropriate and necessary to \nresolve it. \nBASED UPON THE FOREGOING RECITALS, which are expressly made a part of this \nSettlement Agreement, the parties stipulate and agree that these proceedings are to be settled and \ncompromised subject to the approval oft he U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, \npursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, upon and subject to \nthe terms set forth herein. \nI.

PAYMENT INTO AND CUSTODY OF SETTLEMENT FUND: \nA.  As a result of the settlement agreement reached after the Court-ordered mediation, \nthe OPCSO deposited Nine Million Three Hundred Seventy-five Thousand Dollars \nand Noll OOths ($9,375,000.00) together with interest earned since June 2,2004, into \nan interest bearing account in the name of \"Orleans Parish Strip Search Settlement \nFund\" (hereafter referred to as the \"Settlement Fund\") with Hibernia National Bank \n(hereafter referred to as the \"Escrow Agent\"). This Settlement Fund was established \nas a Qualified Settlement Fund under IRS Regulation 1.468B-I, pursuant to the terms  . \nand conditions of the Escrow Agreement previously filed with this Court as Exhibit \nB to Joint Motion for Approval of Escrow Agreement, executed by the Parties on \nSeptember 17, 2004. (Doc. No.124). The terms of that Agreement provided that no \nfunds shall be withdrawn or disbursed from the Settlement Fund except pursuant to \nthe Court's orders or joint written instructions by the Parties.  On Oct. 4, 2005 the \nCourt issued an order permitting the OPCSO to borrow the sums of money in the \nfund, in response to the emergency conditions which existed following the Hurricane \nKatrina disaster (Docket No.  144), and setting forth the terms for handling and \nrestoration of those sums.  On October 4, 2006, the  OPCSO  returned  to  the \nSettlement Fund the sums borrowed, including interest earned, as per the Court's \nOrder.  OPCSO complied with all of the terms in the Court's order for the handling \nand restoration of the Settlement Fund. \nB.  Except as otherwise allowed by the Court's Order of October 4, 2005, described in \nthe previous subparagraph, the Settlement Fund and any earnings therefrom are and \n22 \n\nwill remain invested in U.S. Treasury AAA rated Money Market Fund, unless and \nuntil  otherwise ordered by the Court.  Class  Counsel,  Class Representatives, \nDefendants and Defendants' counsel shall not have any responsibility or liability for \nthe investment of the Settlement Fund. \nC.  All interest or income resulting from the investment of the Settlement Fund shall \nconstitute part of the Settlement Fund and shall accrue to the benefit of and be held \nand administered as part of the Settlement Fund. \nD.  The Settlement Fund and all interest income which accrues from the Settlement Fund \nshall be and remain public funds belonging to OPCSO until disbursement by the \nEscrow Agent in accordance with this Settlement Agreement; the Escrow Agent shall \nhold the Settlement Fund at least until such time as a judgment is rendered finally \neither approving or disapproving this Settlement Agreement and such judgment \nbecomes final and definitive and not subject to further appeal or review, at which \ntime the Settlement Fund shall be managed pursuant to the orders of the Court. \nE.  Under the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall  cause an \naccounting to be maintained at all times that sets forth the principal amount of the \nSettlement Fund and all earnings thereon and fees and expenses paid by the Escrow \nAgent and shall provide monthly reports of the Settlement Fund to designated \ncounsel for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants. Costs, fees and expenses oft he Escrow \nAgent shall be paid from accrued interest or income to the Settlement Fund or the \nprincipal thereof, if accrued interest or income is insufficient. \n23 \n\nF.  The Parties hereby expressly agree and acknowledge that neither the Defendants or \ntheir counsel, Class Counsel, the Class Representatives or the Escrow Agent or its \nCounsel have provided any legal advice or advice regarding tax consequences, to the \nparties or to Class Members with respect to the Settlement Fund or interest or income \nthereon. \nIII.  CLASS ACTION CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS: \nA.  The Claims Administrator agreed to by the parties, identified in Exhibit D attached \nhereto, shall act under the supervision of Class Counsel and shall be subject to the \ncontinuing jurisdiction of the Court.

Upon preliminary Court approval oft his Settlement Agreement, and pursuant to joint \nwritten instruction of the parties or further order of the Court, and from time to time \nas necessary for the proper and timely administration of this Settlement Agreement, \ndistributions from the Settlement Fund may be made as follows: \n24 \n\n1.  To pay costs of notice, costs of administration and the fees of the Claims \nAdministrator and any and all other experts and/or consultants retained to \nfacilitate implementation of this Settlement Agreement; \n2.  To pay costs incurred in the preparation of any tax returns required to be filed \non behalf of the Settlement Fund as well as the taxes, interest and penalties, \nif any, determined to be due thereon, owed by reason of interest and income \nearned on the Settlement Fund. \nC.  Upon final approval of this Settlement Agreement by the Court after the fairness \nhearing, and after the time for appeal of the Court's rulings has passed or,  if \nappealed, the Court's rulings have been affirmed on appeal and the time for further \nappeal or review has passed, the remaining sums in the Settlement Fund shall be \napplied as follows: \nI.  To pay any remaining costs, taxes, expenses and fees, as set forth in III. B. \nabove. \n2.

To distribute the balance oft he Settlement Fund after payment ofa ll amounts \ndescribed above (the \"Net Settlement Fund\") to Authorized Claimants as \napproved by the Court. \nD.  Class CoUnsel intend to submit to the Court a request for incentive awards to the \nindividual class representatives varying from $5,000.00 to $20,000.00 per person \n(Plus interest at the same rate and for the same periods as earned by the Settlement \nFund), based upon the individual class representatives' involvement and participation \nin representing the Class/Sub-Classes in this litigation. Defendants do not object to \nthis  request and  find  it  fair and reasonable under the circumstances  of these \nproceedings. \nE.  In accordance with the terms of this Settlement Agreement and such further orders \nof the Court as may be entered, the Net Settlement Fund shall be distributed to \nAuthorized Claimants, subject to and in accordance with the following: \n1.  By the date specified by the Court (the \"Claim Date\"), each person who \nwishes to be treated as an Authorized Claimant must submit to the Claims \nAdministrator a completed Proof of Claim and Release (\"Proof of Claim\") \nsigned under penalty ofp erjury and supported by such documents as specified \nin the Proof of Claim.  A Proof of Claim shall be deemed timely submitted \nwhen received by the Claims Administrator on or before the Claim Date. \nFacsimile or electronic mail filings are not acceptable and will not be \nconsidered. \n26 \n\n2.  Each Proof of Claim shall be reviewed by the Claims Administrator, with the \nparticipation of Class Counsel, who shall determine in accordance with this \nAgreement whether the claim should be accepted.  Whether or not an \nindividual qualifies as a class member will be based upon the records of the \nOPCSO; if the OPCSO records do not confirm that an individual fits within \none of the Sub-class definitions above, the claim will not be allowed. \nDefendants, through their counsel, reserve and maintain the rightto challenge \nany individual's claim on the basis off raud or non-compliance with the Proof \nof Claim procedures specified herein. Defendants' counsel shall have access \nto all proofs of claim for this purpose, upon request therefor. \n3.  Any individual whose claim is accepted by the Claims Administrator shall be \nreferred to as an \"Authorized Claimant.\" \n4.  A Proof of Claim which does not meet the requirements imposed by this \nAgreement or is otherwise determined to be deficient or untimely by the \nClaims  Administrator  will  be  preliminarily  rejected  by  the  Claims \nAdministrator. \ns. \nThe Claims Administrator will prepare a list of all preliminarily rejected \nclaims, together with its reasons for  rejection.  The list of preliminarily \nrejected claims will be submitted to the Court and counsel for the parties for \nreview, by a date set by the Court, before the Fairness Hearing, and will be \nsupplemented from time to time when additional information or Proofs of \nClaim are received. \n27 \n\n6.  After preliminary rejection of a claim, the Claims Administrator will mail a \nwritten notice to the claimant that hislher Proof of Claim is defective or \nuntimely, with a request to cure the deficiency or justifY the untimely filing \n(\"Request for Cure\"). \n7.  If the additional information submitted in response to the Request for Cure \nis sufficient to cure the deficiency or justifY the untimely filing, the claim will \nbe considered accepted and the claimant will be considered an \"Authorized \nClaimant\" (if approved by the Court). \n8.  If the additional information submitted in response to the Request for Cure \nis insufficient to cure the deficiency, the claim will be rejected by the Claims \nAdministrator. \n9.  Failure to respond to a Request for Cure will result in the claim being \nrejected by the Claims Administrator. \n10.  The Court may either approve or disapprove the Claims Administrator's \ndeterminations and issue whatever orders are appropriate or necessary. \n11.  The Court has the discretion to appoint a special master pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P., Rule 53, or to otherwise proceed as the Court deems appropriate. \n12.  Each claimant and any Class Member who chooses to opt-out from or object \nto the settlement shall be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the \nCourt with respect to hislher claim and each claim, opt-out, and objection is \nsubject to investigation and discovery pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, provided that such investigation and discovery shall be limited to \n28 \n\nthe claimant's status as a Class/Sub-class member and the validity of the \nclaimant's claim, opt-out, or objection, and no discovery shall be allowed on \nthe merits of the above numbered and entitled proceedings or the settlement. \n13.  Prior to any distribution of the Net Settlement Fund to any claimants: (a) the \nClaims Administrator shall submit a [mal list of accepted and rejected \nclaims, objections and opt-outs to the Court for its approval or disapproval \nby the date specified by the Court; (b) all disputes with respect to any rejected \nProofs of Claim, Objections, and  Requests for Exclusion shall have been \nwithdrawn or resolved by the Court (or the time therefor shall have expired); \n(c) all matters concerning attorneys' fees, costs, expenses or disbursements \nshall have been resolved by the Court and all appeals therefrom shall have \nbeen resolved (or the time therefor shall have expired); (d) all costs of \nadministration shall have been paid; and (e) the Court shall have approved the \nreport of the Claims Administrator, and payment of its fees and expenses \nincurred to that date, and shall have directed payment of the Net Settlement \nFunds to the Authorized Claimants. \n14.

Class Members who do not file a timely and valid Request for \nExclusion shall be forever barred from receiving any payment from any \nDefendants for any claims covered by this Settlement Agreement other than \nas provided herein. A Request for Exclusion must unambigulously state the \nClass Members' desire to opt out oft he settlement, must be personally signed \nby the Class Member and include his or her name, date of birth, and an \naddress and/or phone number where the individual can be contacted. By filing \na Request for Exclusion, an individual is asserting that he or she is a member \nof at least one of the three Sub-Classes certified in this lawsuit. \nF.  In addition to  preparing a list of all preliminarily rejected claims,  the Claims \nAdministrator will also prepare a separate lists of all  Requests for Exclusion, \nObjections and  Notices of Intent to Appear at the Fairness Hearing. These lists, \ntogether with copies of any underlying or supporting documents, will be submitted \nintermittently to Class Counsel for review and consideration and for preparation of \na report to the Court and defendants' counsel. These lists and the reports to the Court \nand defendants' counsel will be supplemented from time to time when additional \nRequests for Exclusion, Objections and/or Notices ofIntent to Appear are received \nby the Claims Administrator. \nO.  The Claims Administrator is responsible for docketing, preserving and producing, as \nrequested by the Court or the parties' counsel, all documents (including envelopes) \n30 \n\nreceived by the Claims Administrator relating to Proofs of Claim, Requests for \nExclusion, Objections and Notices of Intent to Appear at the Fairness Hearing. \nH.  As a condition to receiving their award from the Net Settlement Fund, each claimant \nshall be deemed to have released and discharged all the Defendants from any and all \nclaims for damages of any kind and from filing suit or continuing any pending suit \nagainst any Defendant released herein in any court, state or federal, on any claim or \ncause of action covered by this litigation and the settlement thereof.  For purposes \nhereof, the term \"Defendants\" means not only the named defendants in this litigation, \nbut also any and all other individuals presently or formerly employed by or affiliated \nwith the OPCSO who could have been made defendants individually or in their \nofficial capacity in this litigation, and any and all successors or assigns oft he OPCSO \n(including the present Criminal Sheriff Marlin N. Gusman in any capacity) or such \nother related parties in interest. \n1.  Class Counsel and Defendants' Counsel are not providing any tax advice to claimants \nand the decision of whether an Authorized Claimant is required to report their share \nof the Net Settlement Fund to tax authorities is the responsibility of each claimant. \nJ.  Class Counsel, Class Representatives, and Defendants and their counsel shall have \nno responsibility for or liability whatsoever with respect to the investment of or any \ndistribution from the Settlement Fund, the determination, administration, calculation \nor payment of claims, the payment or withholding of taxes, or any losses incurred in \nconnection with any of the foregoing. \n31 \n\nK.  No person shall have any claim against Class Counsel, Class Representatives, \nDefendants,  Defendants'  counselor the  Claims  Administrator  based  on  any \ndistribution from the Settlement Fund made in accordance with this Settlement \nAgreement as approved by the Court. \nIV.  ALLOCATION TO CLASS MEMBERS: \nThe Net Settlement Fund (as defmed in III. C. 4. above) shall be distributed to the Authorized \nClaimants as follows: \nSUB-CLASS  POINT LEVEL \nA-The \"Kelly\" Class  THREE (3) \n------------.------------\nStrip and Visual Body Cavity Search \nApril 25, 1999 through Feb. 14,2002 \nB-The \"Change Out\" Class  ONE (1) \n-------------------.--\nStrip Search During Change-Out; No Visual \nBody Cavity Search \nFeb. 15,2002 through May 31, 2002 \nC-The \"Contempt\" or \"Templeman III\" Class  ONE AND ONE-HALF (1.5) \n--------------------------------. \nStrip Search of Male Arrestee During \nTransfer to Templeman III From IPC \nJune 1,2002 through May 31, 2003 \nNo Visual Body Cavity Search \nAs shown above, each of the Sub-Classes has been given a point level.  An individual can \nbe a member of more than one oft he Sub-Classes or all of them, but will get paid for only one search \nat the highest point level. The value of each point is the same for all three Sub-Classes. The amount \nthat any Authorized Claimant will receive cannot be determined at this time because it depends on \nwhich Sub-Class an individual qualifies for, and how many valid claims in each Sub-Class are \n32 \n\nsubmitted.  Thus, after the Net Settlement Fund is determined, the total number of Authorized \nClaimants' points will be divided into the Net Settlement Fund to determine the cash value of each \npoint.  If, for example, that value is $100.00 per point, those Authorized Claimants in Sub-Class A \nwould receive $300.00 (or 3 points x $100.00 per point = $300.00).  Those Authorized Claimants \nin Sub-Class B would receive $100.00 (or I point x $100.00 =  $100.00).  Those Authorized \nClaimants in Sub-Class C would receive $150.00 (or 1.5 points x $100.00 = $150.00). \nThe following presumptions as to Class/Sub-Class membership shall apply: \nI.  Membership in Sub-Class \"A\" aIkIa the \"Kelly\" Class: \nAny individual (male or female) who was arrested for minor offenses only, \nif transferred from IPC to general population from April 25, 1999 through February 14, 2002, prior \nto his or her first court appearance or release, whichever came fust, will be presumed to have been \nsubjected to a strip and visual body cavity search and will be presumed to be a member of Sub-Class \nA. \n2.  Membership in Sub-Class \"B\" aIkIa the \"Change-Out\" Class: \nAny individual (male or female) who was arrested for minor offenses only, \nif transferred from IPC to general population from February 15, 2002 through May 31, 2002, prior \nto his or her first court appearance or release, whichever came first, will be presumed to have been \nsubjected to a strip search only, without a visual body cavity search, and will be presumed to be a \nmember of Sub-Class B. \n3.  Membership in Sub-Class \"c\" aIkIa the \"Contempt\" or \"Templeman III\" Class \nA male individual who was arrested for minor offenses only, if he was \ntransferred from IPC to Templeman III from June 1, 2002 through May 31,2003, prior to his first \n33 \n\ncourt appearance or release, whichever came first, will be presumed to have been sUbjected to a strip \nsearch in violation of the Court's Order of May 20, 2002 and will be presumed to be a member of \nSub-Class C. \nThe dates provided in the class definitions and these presumptions are based upon the \nfollowing:  April 25, 1999 is the earliest prescriptive date for any claim in this case.  February 15, \n2002 is the effective date of the first Consent Decree entered by the Court granting injunctive relief \nwhich modified OPCSO' s blanket strip and visual body cavity search policy, practice and procedure \nand officially ended the blanket, mass visual body cavity searches. June 1,2002 is the effective date \nof the Supplemental Consent Decree entered by the Court granting injunctive relief which modified \nOPCSO's change-out procedure to require privacy booths.  May 31, 2003 is the last date of the \nTempleman III post-change out blanket, mass strip searches. Whether or not an individual qualifies \nas a class member will be based upon the records of the OPCSO; if the OPCSO records do not \nconfirm that the individual fits within one of the class definitions above, the claim will not be \nallowed. \nV.  NOTICE TO CLASS MEMBERS: \nA.  The Claims Administrator shall implement and administer a notice plan, with the \nassistance of Class Counsel, and pursuant to the continuing jurisdiction oft he Court. \nB.  The notice plan shall include written notice oft his proposed settlement, in substantial \nconformity with the Class Action Notice (Long Form) attached hereto as Exhibit B, \nmailed to the individual Class/Sub-Class members by First Class Mail, with a Proof \nof Claim and Release (Exhibit C).  These documents will be sent to all individual \nClass/Sub-Class members at the last known address according to OPCSO records \n34 \n\nprovided by the Defendants in useable, electronic form, as corrected and verified, to \nthe extent possible, through a national locator database or service and whatever \nadditional post-Katrina address locator resources may be necessary and accessible. \nC.  If, after the initial mailing, an individual written notice is returned as undeliverable, \nthe Claims Administrator will attempt to locate the Class/Sub-Class member by way \nof a national locator database or service and, if another viable address is found, re- il \nmail the Long-Form Notice, with its accompanying documents, to that new address. \nD.  The Claims Administrator and Class Counsel will develop and provide the Court \nwith a notice plan deemed appropriate and consistent with the requirements of due \nprocess which will include media publication to the extent required by due process \nin New Orleans and other major metropolitan areas identified as having significant \nnumbers of the New Orleans area population displaced by Hurricane Katrina.  This \nwill  include,  but  is  not  necessarily  limited  to,  publication  of a  legal  notice \nsubstantially similar to the Class Action Notice (Short Form), attached hereto as \nExhibit B 1, to be printed and published on a date to be set by the Court, in the New \nOrleans area and other designated areas identified to have significant numbers of \npersons displaced from the New Orleans area as a result of Hurricane Katrina. This \nNotice will also be published and posted on the internet. Any additional mass \npublication notice shall either be coordinated with Defendants' counsel as to its form, \ncontent and placement location, or shall be ordered by the Court. \nE.  The Claims Administrator shall provide a copy of the Notices (Short and Long \nForms) and Proof of Claim and Release to anyone who requests these documents. \n35 \n\nThe Claims Administrator can be contacted through a mailing address, through a \ndedicated internet website, and through a toll-free telephone number to be established \nby the Claims Administrator. \nF.  The Claims Administrator shall provide an affidavit to the Court, with a copy to \nClass Counsel and Defendants' Counsel, attesting to the measures undertaken to \nprovide notice of settlement to the Class/Sub-Class Members. \nG.  The Claims Administrator and its employees, agents and assigns, shall maintain the \nprivacy of the names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers and other \ninformation reflected and provided in any records supplied by the Defendants and/or \nthe Class/Sub-Class members themselves, except as to the Court, counsel for the \nparties, the Escrow Agent, and as further ordered by the Court \nH.  Within (IO) days after the Claim Date, the Claims Administrator shall provide to \ncounsel for the parties a list of all claims made and copies of the returned Proofs of \nClaim and Releases, which list and forms shall be confidential and not disclosed by \nany party or their counsel except to the Court and as pursuant to Court order. \n1.

Such enclaves will be provided to \nmembers of the class anytime they are ordered,  directed,  instructed or \notherwise expected to remove or rearrange their clothing in such a fashion \nas would expose their genital areas, breasts, anus and/or buttocks to viewing \nand/or observation by others,  when there is no individualized, reasonable \nsuspicion to justify a strip search  as defined by the Consent Decree of \nJanuary 15, 2002 and OPSCO policy adopted pursuant thereto. \n4.  For purposes of this decree, the plaintiffs' class is defined as follows: Every \nperson who is arrested for a minoroffense(s) only, including a misdemeanor, \npetty offense or violation of a city or parish ordinance, not involving weapons \nor controlled  dangerous substances,  or traffic offense(s), who  is  in  the \ncustody of the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriffs Office (OPSCO) prior to his \nor her first court appearance. \n5.  The \"changing booths\" for male arrestees will be designed and constructed \nin such a manner as to provide sufficient cover to prevent exposure to and/or \nviewing by other persons of the arrestee's genital areas, anus, and buttocks. \nFor female arrestees the \"changing booths\" will provide sufficient cover to \nprevent exposure to  and/or viewing  by  other persons of the arrestee's \nbreasts, genital areas, anus and buttocks. \n6.  The OPCSO \"changing booths\" will be installed and fully operational no later \nthan June 1, 2002.  Plaintiffs counsel will  be afforded the opportunity to \ninspect the booths at the various OPSCO facilities when they are completed. \n7.  Plaintiffs' monitoring of the use and operations of the \"changing booths\" will \nbe included in the monitoring already in place under the terms ofthe January \n15, 2002 Consent Decree and will be carried out subject to the same terms \nand conditions. \n8.

The case is titled Greta Cazenave, et al. v. Sheriff Charles C. Foti, Jr., et al., Docket Number 00-1246 of the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.

Why was this Notice issued?\nA Court authorized this Notice because you have a right to know about a proposed settlement of this class action lawsuit, \nincluding the right to claim money, the right to exclude yourself from the settlement and your other options, before the Court \ndecides whether to give ﬁ nal approval to the settlement. If the Court approves the settlement, and after any appeals are \nresolved, payments will be made to everyone who submitted a timely and valid claim.  This Notice explains the lawsuit, the \nsettlement, your legal rights, your options, what beneﬁ ts are available, who may be eligible for them, and how to get them.\n2. What is the lawsuit about?\nThis lawsuit claims that the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff’s Ofﬁ ce (OPCSO) conducted illegal “strip” and “visual body \ncavity” searches on people who were arrested for minor offenses only (not involving weapons or drugs) who, before their \nﬁ rst court appearance or release (whichever happened ﬁ rst), were transferred from the OPCSO Intake and Processing Center \n(IPC) to general population. This lawsuit claims that these searches were done as part of a blanket policy which was in \nviolation of the right to be free from an unreasonable search and the right to privacy.  This lawsuit has been going on for \nover six  years and covers strip and visual body cavity searches conducted from April 25, 1999 through May 21, 2003.  As \na result of this lawsuit, the OPCSO adopted new, constitutional policies and practices.\n3. What is a “strip” search?\nA “strip” search is the removal or rearrangement of an arrestee’s clothing, including undergarments, when ordered by an \nOPCSO deputy to change into jail uniforms, which exposed the arrested person’s genital area, anus, buttocks and/or breasts \n(in the case of women), to possible view by deputies and other prisoners.\n4. What is a “visual body cavity” search?\nA “visual body cavity” search occurred when an individual, after stripping, was ordered by OPCSO deputies to bend over, \nspread his or her buttocks cheeks, squat, cough, and/or lift testicles or breasts for inspection purposes, in front of deputies \nand sometimes other prisoners.\n5. What is a minor offense?\nA minor offense includes one or more trafﬁ c offenses, misdemeanors, petty offenses, or violations of municipal or parish \nordinances, none of which involves weapons or drugs. It does not include any felonies.\n6. Why is this a class action?\nIn a class action, one or more people, called “Class Representatives,” sue on behalf of people who have similar claims. All \nthese people form a “Class” and each individual is a “Class Member.” One court resolves the issues for all Class Members.  \nWith a class action, each individual doesn’t  have to ﬁ le his or her own lawsuit but can get some money through a simple \nclaims process.\nThe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana is overseeing this class action lawsuit. The case is \nknown as Greta Cazenave, et al. v. Sheriff Charles C. Foti, Jr., et al., Docket No. 00-1246. The people who sued are called \nthe “Plaintiffs”; the people who are being sued, the “Defendants,” are associated with the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff’s \nOfﬁ ce (“OPCSO”).\n7. Why is there a settlement?\nBoth sides agreed to a settlement to avoid the cost and risk of a trial, so that the people affected can get some money in \nexchange for releasing the Defendants from liability.  The Defendants deny that they did anything wrong. All of the strip and \nvisual body cavity searches complained of occurred during the administration of former Criminal Sheriff Charles C. Foti, Jr.  \nThe Class Representatives and the class lawyers think the settlement is best for all Class Members.\nA document called a Class Action Settlement Agreement provides more details about the settlement and is available at \nwww.nolastripsearch.com.\nQUESTIONS?  CALL 1-866-308-7613 TOLL FREE, OR VISIT www.nolastripsearch.com\n2\n\nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT?\nTo see if your rights will be affected by this settlement or if you will get money from the settlement, you ﬁ rst have to \ndetermine if you are a Class Member.\n8. How do I know if I am part of the settlement?\nThe Court decided that Class Members in the settlement are: Every person arrested only on “minor offenses” who entered \nthe Intake and Processing Center (“IPC”) operated by the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff’s Ofﬁ ce (OPCSO), during the \ntime periods set forth below, who was required to submit to any or all of the following procedures, prior to his or her ﬁ rst \ncourt appearance or release, whichever came ﬁ rst. \nIf you ﬁ t into any of the Sub-classes below, you are part of the settlement:\nSub-Class A: You were strip and visual body cavity searched in the presence of OPCSO deputies and/or other \nprisoners from April 25, 1999 through February 14, 2002.\nSub-Class B: You were strip searched when you were ordered to change into clothes given to you by OPCSO in \nthe presence of OPCSO deputies and/or other prisoners from February 15, 2002 through May 31, 2002.\nSub-Class C: You were strip searched when you were ordered to take off your OPCSO garment, in the presence \nof OPCSO deputies and/or other prisoners, as you were being admitted to Templeman III from the IPC from June \n1, 2002 through May 31, 2003.\n9. What if I pled guilty or was found guilty of the minor offense?\nIf you were only charged with a minor offense, you are included and can participate in the settlement even if you pled guilty \nor were found guilty of the minor offense.\n10. What if I was arrested for a felony and a minor offense at the same time?\nIf you were arrested for a felony at the same time you were arrested for a minor offense (even if the felony was later reduced \nto a minor charge or dropped) you are not included in the settlement for that arrest.\n11. What if the minor offense I was arrested for involved weapons or drugs?\nIf you were arrested for a minor offense which involved weapons or drugs you are not included in the settlement for that \narrest.\n12. What if I was strip or visual body cavity searched on different dates than those in the settlement?\nYou are not a member of any Sub-Class and cannot get a payment unless you were strip or visual body cavity searched \nduring at least one of the Sub-Class periods above. If you were strip searched on dates different from these, those searches \nwould not be part of this lawsuit.\n13. What if I was strip or visual body cavity searched after my ﬁ rst court appearance?\nIf you were strip or visual body cavity searched after you had already appeared in court, you cannot get a payment from the \nsettlement; you are not a member of any Sub-Class.\n14.

What does the settlement provide?\nA settlement fund of $9,375,000, plus interest earned since June 2, 2004,  has been established. After deducting attorneys’ \nfees, their expenses, payments to Class Representatives and the costs of administering the settlement, the remaining amount \n(the “Net Settlement Fund”) will be divided up and distributed to people who submit timely and valid claims on a Court- \napproved Proof of Claim and Release form.\n16. How much will my payment be?\nThe amount you get cannot be determined at this time because it depends on which Sub-Class you are in, and how many \nvalid claims are submitted for each Sub-Class. Each of the Sub-classes has been given a point value: 3 points for Sub-\nClass A, 1 point for Sub-Class B, and 1.5 points for Sub-Class C.  BY WAY OF EXAMPLE ONLY,  if each point is later \ndetermined to have a value of $100 then each person in Sub-Class A would receive $300, Sub-Class B members would get \n$100, and Sub-Class C members would get $150. More information on how your payment will be calculated is available in \nthe Settlement Agreement, which can be read or copied at www.nolastripsearch.com.\n17. What if I was strip or visual body cavity searched more than one time?\nIf you were strip or visual body cavity searched more than one time during any Sub-Class periods, you will be paid for only \none (1) search, at the highest point level, whatever that is.\n18. If I’m a member of one of the Sub-Classes,  can I ﬁ le my own lawsuit for what happened to me?\nOnly if you ﬁ le a timely and valid request to exclude yourself (“opt out”) from the settlement.  Otherwise, the settlement \nreleases the OPCSO, and its present and former sheriffs, wardens, deputies and other employees from any claims that you \nmay have against them which are covered by this lawsuit, whether their names appear in the lawsuit or not.\nOPTING OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT\n19.  What if I don’t want to be part of this settlement?\nYou have the right to exclude yourself from this settlement, with or without reason, by sending a timely and valid notice to \nthe Claims Administrator as explained in this section.  If you do so, you won’t be bound by the settlement, but you also won’t \nreceive any of the beneﬁ ts that may be approved by the Court.  You will also have the right to ﬁ le, at your own expense, a \nlawsuit for the same conduct that is the subject of this settlement.  None of the parties to this case or their attorneys make \nany representation that such a lawsuit will be successful.\nIf you wish to exclude yourself from this lawsuit, you must prepare and sign a written request for exclusion which states \nunambiguously that you desire to exclude yourself from the settlement and deliver it to the Claims Administrator so that it \nis received on or before July 2, 2007.
