    "summary": "<p>On July 12, 2004, four female arrestees filed a 42 U.S.C. §1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenging the Marin County Sheriff's policies, practices, and customs concerning the use of pre-arraignment strip and visual body cavity searches in Marin County Jails.  Plaintiffs, who had been arrested for minor criminal infractions, alleged that officers routinely subjected detainees to strip and visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment and in the absence of any reasonable suspicion that the detainees possessed contraband.  Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, claimed that such practice violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution as well as provisions of California state law.  To remedy the alleged violations, Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.</p><p>Later in 2004, Defendants moved to dismiss the suit on grounds that (a) Plaintiffs' claims were time barred and (b) Defendants were immune from liability.  The District Court (Judge Mark J. Jenkins), by order dated December 14, 2004, granted Defendants' motion in part and denied it in part.  Although the Court dismissed some of Plaintiffs' state law claims for failure to comply with the California Tort Claims Act, all of their federal law claims as well as several of their state law claims survived the motion to dismiss.  Discovery ensued.</p><p>On January 1, 2006, the named defendants moved for summary judgment.  Plaintiffs filed opposition papers, and the Court thereafter issued an order requesting supplemental briefing on the issues.  Chatoian v. County of Marin, 2006 WL 568312 (N.D.Cal. Mar 03, 2006).  After further briefing, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of all named Defendants on all counts.  The Court, however, did not enter summary judgment as to the unnamed individual defendants, who were identified as \"Deputies for Does 1 through 25.\"</p><p>On June 5, 2007, Plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint to substitute the names of individual deputies for the unnamed Doe defendants.  The Doe defendants objected to the proposed amendment, arguing that it was barred by the statute of limitations.  On December 21, 2007, the District Court found that, because Plaintiffs had failed to comply with California law requiring that they serve the individual defendants with the lawsuit within three years of its initial filing, Plaintiffs' claims against the Doe defendants were time barred.  As such, the Court denied Plaintiffs' request to amend its complaint and entered final judgment in favor of the Doe defendants.  Chatoian v. County of Marin, 2007 WL 4557792, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95438 (N.D.Cal. Dec 21, 2007).</p><p>On January 18, 2008, Plaintiffs appealed the Court's final judgment.  On September 2, 2008, the Ninth Circuit was informed that the parties had reached a tentative settlement, and ordered the appellant to submit a motion or stipulation to dismiss.  On September 18, 2008, the Ninth Circuit deemed the appeal voluntarily dismissed because the appellant failed to obey that order.</p><p></p>",

DOLYE is, and at all material\n16 times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of the COUNTY OF MARIN, responsible for\n17 administering the Jail facilities and for making, overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices,\n18 and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the Marin County Jail.  He is sued in his\n19 individual and official capacities.\n20 7. Defendants MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their fictitious\n21 names (Does 1 through 100) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the Marin County Jail,\n22 subjected plaintiffs to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without having, and\n23 recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or\n24 weapons.   Furthermore, Defendants MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their\n25 fictitious names (Does 1 through 100) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the Marin County\n26 Jail, confined plaintiffs in cells nude following strip searching said plaintiffs.\nPage 3 of 14\nDARCELLE L. CHATOIAN, et al. v. COUNTY OF MARIN, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 07/12/2004     Page 4 of 14\n1 8. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n2 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages of\n3 the state of California, the COUNTY OF MARIN and/or the MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF’S\n4 DEPARTMENT. \n5 9. Defendants whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names\n6 of ROES 1 through 20, are all agents and/or employees of one or another of the other named\n7 defendants who ordered, condoned, authorized, covered up, or were otherwise associated with the\n8 implementation of the illegal policy and practices relating to strip searches and nude confinement\n9 complained of herein.  \n10 10. Defendant COUNTY OF MARIN is, and at all material times referred to herein, was a\n11 division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or practice\n12 causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs\n13 damaged plaintiffs as herein alleged.  Plaintiffs’ allegations against the COUNTY are based on acts\n14 and omissions of the SHERIFF and his DEPUTIES and on acts and omissions of persons who are\n15 COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’S breach of its duty to protect plaintiffs from the\n16 wrongful conduct of said persons and employees.\n17 11. Defendants MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT and MARIN COUNTY\n18 SHERIFF ROBERT T. DOYLE, in his Individual and Official Capacity, also maintained or permitted\n19 an official policy or custom of causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained\n20 of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein alleged.  \n21 12. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning\n22 three (3) years before June 23, 2003, and continuing to this date, were subjected by defendants to pre-\n23 arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, and recording in\n24 writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n25 Some of the similarly situated plaintiffs were confined by defendants naked in cells following their\n26 having been subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches.\nPage 4 of 14\nDARCELLE L. CHATOIAN, et al. v. COUNTY OF MARIN, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 07/12/2004     Page 5 of 14\n1 FACTS\n2 13. On or about November 2, 2003, plaintiff DARCELLE L. CHATOIAN (hereinafter\n3 referred to as “plaintiff” or “CHATOIAN”) was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence in\n4 Mill Valley, California.  Plaintiff CHATOIAN was taken to the Marin County Jail in San Rafael,\n5 California, where all of her clothing was forcibly removed by three (3) male officers and she was\n6 subjected to a visual body cavity search then placed in a cell, nude, for six (6) hours until she was\n7 removed and released from custody.  \n8 14. On or about late July or early August 2003, plaintiff CYNTHIA TASCA (hereinafter\n9 referred to as “plaintiff” or “TASCA”) was arrested allegedly for disturbing the peace, a misdemeanor,\n10 and transported to the Marin County Jail where she was directed to remove all of her clothes to be strip\n11 searched.  When she refused to remove her clothes she was forcibly strip searched and confined, nude,\n12 in a cell, prior to her arraignment.\n13 15. Within six (6) months of her arrest, plaintiff CHATOIAN filed a group Government\n14 Tort Claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of said claim is attached hereto as\n15 Exhibit “A”, and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by this reference).  Plaintiff CHATOIAN’s\n16 group claim was denied on or about March 3, 2004, allowing the filing of this complaint or state\n17 statute and constitutional violations.  \n18 16. Within six (6) months of her arrest, plaintiff TASCA filed a Government Tort Claim (a\n19 copy of said claim is attached hereto as Exhibit “B”, and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by\n20 this reference).  Plaintiff TASCA’s claim was denied on or about January 13, 2004, allowing the filing\n21 of this complaint or state statute and constitutional violations.  \n22 17. Plaintiffs are informed and therefore allege, that defendants routinely follow their\n23 policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including plaintiffs, to strip and\n24 visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the\n25 search will be productive of contraband or weapons.  \n26 \\\\\\\nPage 5 of 14\nDARCELLE L. CHATOIAN, et al. v. COUNTY OF MARIN, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 07/12/2004     Page 6 of 14\n1 18. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely\n2 follow their policy, practice and custom of confining detainees, including plaintiffs, naked in cells\n3 following subjecting them to visual body cavity searches.\n4 19. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the ability\n5 to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants’ custody, at\n6 the Marin County Jail since June 23, 2000, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity\n7 searches prior to arraignment without defendants having first, and recording, a reasonable suspicion\n8 that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n9 20. Defendant MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF ROBERT T. DOYLE is personally\n10 responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom\n11 pursuant to which some of the plaintiffs herein were subjected to the searches complained of herein. \n12 21. As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, plaintiff, and each\n13 of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy,\n14 and violation of due process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is\n15 entitled to recover damages according to proof but, at a minimum, $1,000 as specified in California\n16 Penal Code § 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n17 22.  As a result of being confined, naked, in a cell as complained of herein, following being\n18 strip searched, each of the plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress and violation of\n19 due process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover\n20 damages according to proof, but a minimum of $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and §\n21 52.1(b).\n22 CLASS CLAIMS\n23 23. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs were subjected were\n24 performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF\n25 ROBERT T. DOYLE, MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, COUNTY OF MARIN, the\n26 individual SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 100, and the\nPage 6 of 14\nDARCELLE L. CHATOIAN, et al. v. COUNTY OF MARIN, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 07/12/2004     Page 7 of 14\n1 individuals whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES 1\n2 through 20.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the\n3 alleged offense for which plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were\n4 eligible for cite and release under Penal Code § 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were\n5 eligible for and/or were released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of\n6 herein were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintiffs so searched\n7 possessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable belief that the\n8 searches would produce contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-\n9 approved document. \n10 24. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n11 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California Code of Civil Procedure\n12 § 382.  \n13 25. The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including June\n14 23, 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices complained of\n15 herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity search at\n16 the Marin County Jail without defendants having, and recording, a reasonable suspicion that the search\n17 would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n18 26. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n19 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact\n20 number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are\n21 more than 10 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of defendants and\n22 subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n23 relating to said searches.  \n24 27. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are informed\n25 and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the class including,\n26 but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual body cavity\nPage 7 of 14\nDARCELLE L. CHATOIAN, et al. v. COUNTY OF MARIN, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 07/12/2004     Page 8 of 14\n1 searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in the Marin County Jail; (2)\n2 whether persons are subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment without there being\n3 any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has\n4 concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a\n5 visual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted in an area of\n6 privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches, or whether\n7 the visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups and/or in open areas where they may be\n8 observed by persons not participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the visual body cavity searches\n9 are reasonably related to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and\n10 whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n11 28. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are informed\n12 and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the class including,\n13 but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity searches on persons\n14 prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to\n15 believe any particular inmate has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely be\n16 discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity\n17 searches on persons without first reasonably relating the use of the visual body cavity search to\n18 defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less\n19 intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in\n20 areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating\n21 plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights and the protections afforded to plaintiffs under\n22 California Penal Code section 4030; and, (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search policy and\n23 procedure is in accordance with the State and/or Federal Constitution.\n24 29. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n25 representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, prior to arraignment, without\n26 reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or\nPage 8 of 14\nDARCELLE L. CHATOIAN, et al. v. COUNTY OF MARIN, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 07/12/2004     Page 9 of 14\n1 contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-\n2 approved writing), and named plaintiffs were placed in cells, nude, for extended periods of time (in\n3 excess of one hour).  Representative plaintiffs have the same interests and suffered the same type of\n4 injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice,\n5 and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches before arraignment\n6 without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of\n7 contraband or weapons.  Additionally, plaintiffs, in accordance with defendants’ policy, practice, and\n8 custom, were improperly and unjustifiably confined, nude, in cells for extended periods of time.  \n9 Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each\n10 class member suffered actual damages either as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity\n11 search and/or as a result of being improperly and unjustifiably placed and confined in a cell nude.  The\n12 actual damages suffered by representative plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual\n13 damages suffered by each class member.  \n14 30. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n15 plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ interests are consistent with\n16 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n17 31. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of\n18 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n19 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards\n20 of conduct for the parties opposing the class.  \n21 32. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of\n22 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications\n23 with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impair\n24 or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n25 33. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are\n26 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\nPage 9 of 14\nDARCELLE L. CHATOIAN, et al. v. COUNTY OF MARIN, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 07/12/2004     Page 10 of 14\n1 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n2 respect to the class as a whole.  \n3 34. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is\n4 superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between\n5 the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of\n6 the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class\n7 members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and\n8 believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate suits\n9 would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members\n10 of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\n11 thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims\n12 arise in the same location; i.e., the MARIN COUNTY JAIL.  It will promote judicial efficiency to\n13 resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.  \n14 35. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are informed\n15 and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be ascertained from\n16 records maintained by the COUNTY OF MARIN and defendant SHERIFF ROBERT T. DOYLE and\n17 defendant MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\n18 thereupon allege, that defendants’ records reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone\n19 numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in the Marin County Jails.  Plaintiffs are\n20 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that records of, and maintained by defendants reflect who\n21 was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search occurred, where the search\n22 occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and was recorded in a supervisor-\n23 approved writing, when persons searched were arraigned, the charges on which such persons were\n24 arrested, whether persons were confined in cells nude, the justification recorded for placing individuals\n25 in cells nude, how long individuals remained in cells nude, and what treatment they received while so\n26 confined.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing\nPage 10 of 14\nDARCELLE L. CHATOIAN, et al. v. COUNTY OF MARIN, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 07/12/2004     Page 11 of 14\n1 information is contained in defendants’ computer system and that the information necessary to identify\n2 the class members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release\n3 from custody, is readily available from said computer system.  \n4 36. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class members\n5 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice\n6 to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe,\n7 and thereupon allege, that defendants’ computer records contain a last known address for class\n8 members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such last\n9 known address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class members of\n10 the following:\n11 i. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class;\n12 ii. The nature of the action;\n13 iii. Their right to “opt out” of the action within a given time, in which event they\n14 will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n15 iv. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to be represented by their own counsel and\n16 to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented by the\n17 named class plaintiffs and their counsel; and \n18 v. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to share in any recovery in favor of the\n19 class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues\n20 adverse to the class.  \n21 COUNT ONE\n(Violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n22 on behalf of Plaintiffs and all persons similarly situated)\n23 37.

CHATOIAN (hereinafter\n5 “CHATOIAN”), CYNTHIA TASCA (hereinafter “TASCA”), CORIN RASMUSSEN (hereinafter\n6 “RASMUSSEN”) and KORISSA RUSSELL (hereinafter “RUSSELL”) that they were unlawfully\n7 strip searched at the Marin County Jail.  Plaintiffs CHATOIAN, TASCA  and RASMUSSEN claim\n8 that they were “strip searched” prior to placement in a safety cell.  Plaintiff RUSSELL claims that\n9 she was strip searched prior to placement in the general jail population.  Plaintiffs assert claims\n10 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983 (hereinafter “section 1983).  Specifically, Plaintiffs assert claims\n11 against DOYLE under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and\n12 a municipal Monell-type claim against COUNTY OF MARIN for relief under federal and state law.\n13 Plaintiffs also assert state law claims against Defendant DOYLE for violation of California Civil\n14 Code section 52.1 and California Penal section 4030.  \n15 A. Policies of the County of Marin Regarding Strip Searches and Safety Cell Placements\n16 The COUNTY OF MARIN has a written policy that governs the conduct of strip searches\n17 at the Marin County Jail.  McQueeny Decl. ¶2, Ex. A.  That policy was revised and distributed to all\n18 personnel of the Marin County Jail in October 2003.  Id.  The policy regarding strip searches governs\n19 the “Clothing Exchange” that occurs when an inmate3 changes from his or her street clothes into\n20 institutional clothing prior to being “placed” in the general jail population.  Id. Pursuant to the policy,\n21 “[t]he inmate may not be viewed, observed, or monitored by any deputy or staff member during the\n22 exchange and/or shower, unless there is reasonable suspicion that the inmate is concealing a weapon\n23 or contraband” during the Clothing Exchange.  Id.  The policy also prohibits strip searching persons\n24 arrested on charges involving weapons, violence and/or narcotics unless “[t]here exists specific and\n25 articulable facts sufficient to induce an ordinary, prudent, cautious, and reasonable officer exposed\n26 to a similar set of facts to believe the individual to be searched is in possession of a weapon,\n27\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 3Defendants reference to arrestees, detainees and inmates collectively as “inmates.”  \nWEIBERG & DELEHANT\nA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nP.O.

B.  That policy requires deputies who place individuals in safety cells to\n5 allow the individual to “retain sufficient clothing, or be provided with a suitably designed ‘safety\n6 garment’, to provide for their personal privacy unless specific identifiably risks to the inmate’s safety\n7 or to the security of the facility are documented.”  Id.  \n8 Deputies do not require all inmates who are placed in safety cells to remove their clothing.\n9 If an inmate is placed in a safety cell because he or she is damaging Jail property and/or is\n10 considered to be a danger to staff or another inmate, Jail staff only require the inmate to remove\n11 those items of clothing that could be used as a weapon, such as shoes.  McMains Depo. 13:3-13.\n12 Only those inmates that are considered to be a danger to themselves or others are required to\n13 exchange their clothes for a “safety garment.”  Hernandez Depo. 62:3-9.  \n14 For an inmate who is considered a danger to themselves, staff of the same gender will enter\n15 the safety cell and request that the inmate voluntary exchange his or her clothing for a safety\n16 garment.  Hernandez Depo. 64:4-14.  The inmate will hand over his or her clothes to the same-\n17 gender jail staff and in exchange will be provided a safety smock.  McQueeny Decl. ¶4, Garrett\n18 Depo. 61:4-15.  The deputies do not perform an inspection or strip search of any kind.  McQueeny\n19 Decl. ¶5; Goss Depo. 25:25-26:3 When an inmate refuses to cooperate, jail staff will place the\n20 inmate in a control hold and remove the clothing from the inmate.  Barry Depo. 29:15-21.  In those\n21 circumstances deputies of the same gender remove the clothing from the inmate and perform the\n22 clothing exchange.  McQueeny Decl. ¶5; Barry Depo. 29:15-21; Goss Depo. 21:1-4.  If emergency\n23 circumstances arise such that there are not enough deputies of the same gender as the inmate and\n24 emergency circumstances arise, deputies of the opposite gender will assist in the clothing exchange\n25 by holding down the inmate while deputies of the same gender remove the inmates clothing.  Barry\n26 Depo. 29:15-21; Hernandez Depo. 70:18-71:4.  If possible, deputies also cover the inmate with a\n27 safety smock or blanket during the clothing exchange.  McQueeny Decl. ¶6, Shelstrate Depo. 17:10-\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 18:16.  They also leave the safety smock, blanket or both in the cell with the inmate.

The officers who arrested her brought her to the Marin County Jail.\n5 CHATOIAN Depo. 98:9-16.  \n6 When Plaintiff CHATOIAN arrived at the Marin County Jail, officers from the Mill Valley\n7 Police Department reported that CHATOIAN was suicidal and that she said that she wasn’t going\n8 to live and was going to die.

Regarding Strip Searches\n2 1. The Fourteenth Amendment Claims of Plaintiff RUSSELL Regarding the\nAlleged Strip Search Fail as a Matter of Law.\n3\n4 Plaintiff RUSSELL asserts claims arising under the Fourteenth Amendment for the conduct\n5 arising out of her alleged strip search.  Claims arising from the “reasonableness” of a search,\n6 however, are analyzed under the Fourth Amendment’s “objective reasonableness” standard rather\n7 than under a substantive due process standard.  Grahm v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 388; 109 S.Ct. 1865\n8 (1989).  Therefore, the claims of Plaintiff RUSSELL for violation of Fourteenth Amendment in\n9 Count One and Count Two of the Complaint fail as a matter of a law and should be dismissed.  \n10\n2. The Policies of the County of Marin Regarding the Conduct of Strip Searches\n11 at the Marin County Jail Do Not Violate the Fourth Amendment.\n12 Plaintiff RUSSELL contends that she was strip searched in violation of the Fourth and/or\n13 Fourteenth Amendments prior to placement in the general jail population of the Marin County Jail.\n14 Initially, Defendants submit that Plaintiff RUSSELL cannot establish an underlying violation of the\n15 Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments.  Assuming arguendo Plaintiff RUSSELL can establish and\n16 underlying violation, there is no evidence that a policy, practice and/or custom of the COUNTY OF\n17 MARIN was the “moving force” behind such a violation.  \n18 In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558-60 (1979), the Supreme Court considered whether\n19 visual body cavity and strip searches violated the Fourth Amendment rights of pre-trial inmates.  The\n20 Court stated that whether such searches were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and thus\n21 constitutional, depended on “a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion\n22 of personal rights that the search entails.” Id. at 559.  In determining whether a search is reasonable,\n23 the courts must “consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted,\n24 the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.” Id.  The Bell Court then held\n25 that a policy of conducting blanket strip searches of inmates after contact visits and without\n26 reasonable suspicion that the particular inmate was concealing weapons or contraband does not\n27 violate the Fourth Amendment.

Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (1984), the Ninth Circuit created a limited exception to\n2 the rule that blanket strip searches of pretrial inmates, after visiting and without individualized\n3 suspicion that the inmate was secreting contraband,  do not violate the Fourth Amendment.  The\n4 Court held that arrestees charged with only minor offenses, who were freshly arrested and brought\n5 into a jail, may be subject to a strip search only if jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that\n6 the individual arrestee is carrying contraband.  Giles, 746 F.2d 617.  The Court reasoned that \n7 Visitors to the detention facility in Bell could plan\ntheir visits and organize their smuggling activities.  In\n8 contrast, arrest and confinement in the Bonneville\nCounty Jail are unplanned events, so the policy could\n9 not possibly deter arrestees from carrying contraband.\n10 Id.   Thus, Giles creates a limited exception to the rule enumerated in Bell for those persons who are\n11 freshly arrested on minor charges and have not yet had the opportunity to plan smuggling activity.\n12 Subsequently, The Ninth Circuit established a two-step analysis for  determining the\n13 reasonableness of a strip search of persons freshly arrested on minor charges.  First, the Court must\n14 consider the policy of the jail to determine whether it permits searches without reasonable suspicion\n15 that the inmate is a weapon or concealing contraband.  Even if a plaintiff demonstrates an\n16 unconstitutional policy, the “search, although not supportable under an institutional policy, is not per\n17 se unconstitutional.” Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 715 (9th Cir. 1989).  If\n18 the policy permits unlawful searches, then the Court proceeds to the second step. The Court “must\n19 examine the particular circumstances surrounding [plaintiff’s] arrest to determine whether there was\n20 reasonable suspicion [that an inmate may be concealing a weapon or contraband] to conduct a visual\n21 body-cavity search.” Id.  See also Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir. 1990).\n22 In contrast to minor crimes not involving violence, drugs and weapons, the Ninth Circuit has\n23 held that sometimes the charge itself is sufficiently associated with violence to establish reasonable\n24 suspicion for a strip search.  See Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir.\n25 1989) (Felony charge of grand theft auto sufficiently associated with violence to justify a strip\n26 search).  This rule is in accord with the Eleventh Circuit.  See Hicks v. Moore, 422 F.3d 1246, 1252\n27 (11th Cir. 2005) (Strip search after arrest for family violence battery justified based on the charge\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 alone).  \nWEIBERG & DELEHANT\nA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nP.O.

First, the plaintiff must establish that\n3 search is conducted on a inmate who is freshly arrested on a minor crime not involving violence,\n4 drugs or weapon.  Second, the plaintiff must also establish that the officer conducting the search did\n5 not have reasonable suspicion that the inmate is concealing weapons or contraband.  \n6 The policy of the Marin County Jail with regard to strip searches does not violate the Fourth\n7 Amendment.  Specifically, the policy of the Marin County Jail precludes strip searches that would\n8 violate the Fourth Amendment.  First, the policy precludes strip searches of persons who are charged\n9 with crimes not involving weapons, violence and/or narcotics. “CLOTHING EXCHANGE: The\n10 inmate may not be viewed, observed, or monitored during the clothing exchange and/or shower,\n11 unless there is reasonable suspicion that the inmate is concealing a weapon or contraband.”\n12 McQueeny Decl. Ex. A., p.2.  Additionally, “once any post-arrest through pre-arraignment prisoner\n13 has been subjected to the appropriate level of search ...strip searching will only occur based upon\n14 reasonable suspicion that the prisoner is in possession of a weapon, narcotics and/or possession of\n15 any contraband which might aid escape.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The policy also allows strip\n16 searches where “[t]here exists specific and articulable facts sufficient to induce an ordinarily prudent,\n17 cautious, and reasonable officer exposed to a similar set of facts to believe the individual to be\n18 searches is in possession of a weapon, controlled substance, or other item of contraband.”  Id..4\n19 Finally, although not mandated by the Fourth Amendment, the policy requires written authorization\n20 by the Booking Sergeant before a staff member can perform a strip search.  Id.  Thus, this policy\n21 conforms with the restrictions on strip searches imposed by the Fourth Amendment.  In fact, due to\n22 the requirement of supervisory review/approval and additional preclusion of strip searches after\n23 arraignment, the policy precludes strip searches that are not prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.\n24 For each of those reasons, , Plaintiff RUSSELL cannot demonstrate that the written municipal policy\n25 of the Marin County Jail was the “moving force” behind a constitutional violation.  \n26\n27 4  The policy also allows strip searches in three “other situations” that are not applicable to the facts of this case\nLAW OFFICES OF because the named plaintiffs do not fit into these three categories.

Plaintiffs Cannot Demonstrate That a Widespread Custom and Practice Was\nthe “Moving Force” Behind a Constitutional Violation of Plaintiff KORISSA\n2 RUSSELL.\n3 In order to establish Monell-type liability on a “failure to train” or “failure to supervise”\n4 theory Plaintiffs must prove that the policymaker of the County enacted policies that amount to a\n5 “conscious  disregard”  and/or  “deliberate  indifference”  to  prevention  of  violations  of  the\n6 Constitution.  Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1997), citing Board of the County Comm’rs\n7 v.  Brown  117  S.Ct.  1382,  1390,  489  US  378  (1997).    In  that  regard,  the  existence  of  a\n8 constitutionally valid policy that is properly updated and distributed to every officer of a police\n9 department, and absent any previous claims that would place the chief of police on notice of\n10 violations, there is no basis for Monell liability.  See Swain, 117 F.3d at 11.\n11 In this case, it is undisputed that the COUNTY OF MARIN has a written policy regarding,\n12 the conduct of strip searches at the Marin County Jail.  Additionally, it is undisputed that the written\n13 policy was properly updated and distributed to every deputy who worked at the Marin County Jail.\n14 Furthermore, as demonstrated above, that policy on its face is constitutionally valid.  Finally, there\n15 is no evidence of a widespread custom or strip searching and/or placing pre-trial inmates in safety\n16 cells in violation of the polices of the Marin County Jail.  Therefore, Defendants respectfully submit\n17 that Plaintiffs cannot present evidence to establish a triable issue of material fact regarding a\n18 widespread custom or practice that would support Monell-type liability.\n19 Here, only Plaintiff RUSSELL claims that she was strip searched pursuant to the policy of\n20 the COUNTY OF MARIN regarding strip searches.  It is also undisputed that Deputy Seymour\n21 conducted an investigation to determine whether or not there was reasonable suspicion that would\n22 support strip searching Plaintiff RUSSELL.  Seymour Depo. 24:8-24, 31:25-32:4.  That investigation\n23 revealed a prior criminal history that included a conviction for charges of smuggling a weapon into\n24 a courthouse and current charges of violence.  Seymour Depo. 32:8-12, 33:3-10. Thus, personnel of\n25 the Marin County Jail had a reasonable suspicion that Plaintiff RUSSELL may by concealing a\n26 weapon or contraband based on the prior charge of smuggling a weapon into a courthouse and her\n27 current charges involving violence.  Due to the fact that Deputy Seymour had reasonable suspicion\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 to strip search Plaintiff RUSSELL, cannot establish an underlying violation of a constitutional right\nWEIBERG & DELEHANT\nA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nP.O.

Moreover, there is no evidence of, nor does an isolated\n2 single incident involving the lawful strip search of Plaintiff RUSSELL,  a widespread custom or\n3 practice of unlawful strip searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment.    Assuming arguendo\n4 Plaintiff RUSSELL claims that Deputy Seymour violated the policy by strip searching her without\n5 reasonable suspicion, the COUNTY OF MARIN is not liable for the action of its officers who\n6 allegedly violated department policy.  That is, if Plaintiffs seek to impose liability on the COUNTY\n7 OF MARIN for violations of its policy regarding safety cell placements and/or strip searches then\n8 the COUNTY OF MARIN is an improper Defendant.  See Monell, 436 U.S. at 694; See also  Bull\n9 v. City and County of San Francisco, ND Cal., Case No. C 03-01840 CRB. Req. Jud. Not. Ex. B,\n10 p. 19-20.  Therefore, Plaintiff RUSSELL cannot establish a widespread custom and/or practice that\n11 was the “moving force” behind a violation.  \n12 For all of the foregoing reasons, the COUNTY OF MARIN is entitled to summary judgment\n13 for the claims of Plaintiff RUSSELL arising from Monell-type liability in Count One and Count Two\n14 of the First Amended Complaint.\n15 B. Safety Cells\n16 1. The Policies of the County of Marin Regarding the Conduct of Safety Cell\nPlacements at the Marin County Jail Do Not Violate the Fourth or Fourteenth\n17 Amendments.\n18 Plaintiffs CHATOIAN, TASCA and RASMUSSEN claim that they were “strip searched”\n19 in violation of the Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments when they were placed in a safety cell at\n20 the Marin County Jail.  Initially, Defendants submit that these three plaintiffs cannot establish that\n21 they were “strip searched” in violation of the Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments.  Assuming\n22 arguendo these three Plaintiffs can establish a strip search that violates the Fourth and/or Fourteenth\n23 Amendments there is no evidence that a policy, practice and/or custom of the COUNTY OF MARIN\n24 was the “moving force” behind the violation.  \n25 “[T]he placement of pretrial detainees in safety cells is ‘punishment’ in violation of the\n26 Fourteenth Amendment only if prison officials act with deliberate indifference to the inmates’\n27 needs.”  Anderson v.

Id. at 1314-1315.  In addition to the placement,\n2 two of the plaintiffs were shackled to the “toilet grate.”  Id.  One Plaintiff also complained that “he\n3 was shackled all night to the toilet grate with leather restraints and was given only a paper shirt that\n4 prison officials placed over his lap.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Based on those facts, the court held that\n5 Plaintiffs failed to established the elements of a Fourteenth Amendment violation because although\n6 “the safety cell is admittedly a very severe environment, but it is employed in response to very severe\n7 safety concerns.”  Id. at 1314.5\n8 It is also not a violation of the Fourth Amendment “for a male guard to require a loud and\n9 violent female prisoner [who was freshly arrested on charges of public intoxication] to disrobe in his\n10 presence before placing her in a padded cell for her own safety.”  Hill v. McKinley, 311 F.3d 899,\n11 903 (8th Cir. 2001).  Additionally, “use of male guards in an otherwise justified transfer of an unruly\n12 and naked female prisoner is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.”  Id.  The Hill court analyzed\n13 the circumstances of placing an inmate in a safety cell under the Fourth Amendment.  Id.  However,\n14 the court did not impose the same “reasonable suspicion” requirement that other courts (including\n15 the Ninth Circuit) have imposed on “strip searches.”  Rather, the court recognized that “prisoners\n16 have no general right not to be seen by members of the opposite sex” and that “prisoners are entitled\n17 to very narrow zones of privacy, and circumstances may warrant the most invasive of intrusions into\n18 bodily privacy.”  Id.  At 905-906.  Furthermore, the court cited Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093,1102\n19 (8th Cir. 1990) which held that opposite-sex surveillance performed on the same basis as same-sex\n20 surveillance is not unreasonable where it is justified by safety and equal opportunity staffing\n21 concerns.  Id., citing Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093,1102 (8th Cir. 1990).  Thus, in order to prevail\n22 on a Fourth and/or Fourteenth amendment claim arising out of the placement, removal of clothing\n23 and other actions associated with the use of safety cells, a plaintiff must demonstrate by substantial\n24 evidence that the invasion of privacy was an exaggerated response to the security needs of the\n25 facility. Id.  at 903, citing Franklin v. Lockhart 883 F.2d 654, 656-57 (8th Cir. 1989).  Moreover,\n26\n5\n  The plaintiffs in Anderson challenged the use of a safety cell generally.

That policy only authorizes the use of a safety cell for\n6 inmates  who  fit  into  the  following  categories:  (1)  Display  behavior  which  results  in  the\n7 damage/destruction of county jail property; (2) Presents an immediate danger to themselves or\n8 others; (3) Makes verbal threats to harm themselves, and; (4) Makes overt attempts to assault staff\n9 or other inmates.  McQueeny Decl. Ex. B.  The policy also mandates that “[i]nmates will be allowed\n10 to retain sufficient clothing, or be provided with a suitably designed ‘safety garment’, to provide for\n11 their personal privacy unless specific identifiable risks to the inmate’s safety or to the security of the\n12 facility are documented.”  Id.  Furthermore, the policy does not provide that inmates placed in a\n13 safety cell are to be strip searched.  Thus, the policy is not “deliberately indifferent” to the needs of\n14 arrestees at the Marin County Jail because it precludes placement in a safety cell unless the inmate\n15 presents a security risk to him or herself and/or the security of the facility.  Additionally, the policy\n16 does not present an “exaggerated response” to the security needs of the facility because it does not\n17 infringe on one of the “very narrow zones of privacy” that are afforded to prisoners.  Rather, the\n18 policy addresses those “narrow zones of privacy” by permitting inmates to retain their clothing\n19 and/or be given a “safety garment.”  Furthermore, the policy does not provide that inmates placed\n20 in a safety cell are to be strip searched.  Thus, the policy does not violate the Fourth and/or\n21 Fourteenth Amendments.  Therefore, there is no evidence of a policy, that would establish Monell-\n22 type liability against the COUNTY OF MARIN for the claims of Plaintiffs CHATOIAN, TASCA\n23 and RASMUSSEN arising out of their placement in a safety cell at the Marin County Jail.\n24 2.

See Anderson, 45 F.3d 1310; Hill, 311 F.3d 899,\n2 discussed supra.  Assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs CHATOIAN, TASCA and RASMUSSEN can\n3 demonstrate an underlying constitutional violation, they cannot demonstrate that the violation was\n4 the result of a widespread custom or practice.    \n5 First, there is no evidence of a widespread custom or practice of conducting strip searches\n6 of inmates during the “clothing exchange” prior to placement in the safety cell.  Plaintiffs claims\n7 regarding safety cell placements are that they were strip searched .  Plfs’ Compl. ¶¶4,5,14, 20.\n8 Therefore, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate a violation of the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments\n9 because there is no evidence of a widespread custom or practice of strip searching inmates prior to\n10 placement in the safety cell.  \n11 Deputies of the Marin County Jail determined that Plaintiff CHATOIAN was a danger to\n12 herself and therefore placed her into a safety cell.  First, the officers who arrested CHATOIAN\n13 reported that she was suicidal and had said she wasn’t going to live and was going to die.  Siegel\n14 Depo. 24:3-12.  Plaintiff CHATOIAN also said. “Yes, I’m going to die” when Deputy Monge asked\n15 “Do you want to hurt yourself?”  Siegel Depo. 23:6-13.  Therefore, deputies had reason to believe\n16 that CHATOIAN was a danger to herself based on the reports of the arresting officers and her\n17 comments to the jail staff about hurting herself.  \n18 Deputies also did not violate the rights of Plaintiff CHATOIAN when they removed her\n19 clothes during the clothing exchange.  Initially, two female deputies, Shelstrate and Monge, placed\n20 CHATOIAN into a safety cell and requested that she voluntarily exchange her clothes for the safety\n21 smock.  Shelstrate Depo. 16:11-17:7, 22:10-11.  Male deputies only intervened after CHATOIAN\n22 refused to cooperate  in the clothing exchange and exchange her clothing for a safety smock, backed\n23 into a corner and began yelling and the jail did not have available other female staff to assist.\n24 Schelstraete Depo. 16:11-17:7, 23:22-24:4; Hernandez Depo. 91:8-22, 92:14-17.  The male deputies\n25 also only held her down while female deputies removed her clothes and provided here with the safety\n26 smock.  Id.  The Deputies also covered CHATOIAN with the smock while her clothes were removed\n27 and left it on her when they left the safety cell.  Shelstrate Depo. 17:8-15, 24:11-13.  Moreover, there\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 is no evidence that Plaintiff CHATOIAN was the subject of an form of stip search.

Anderson, 45 F.3d at 1313.  The use of male deputies also is consistent with Hill\n4 where the Eighth Circuit held that it was not a violation for male staff to require a loud and violent\n5 female prisoner to disrobe and also to participate in transferring her while she is completely naked.\n6 Hill, 311 F.3d at 903. \n7 Similarly, Plaintiff TASCA cannot establish that the policy of the COUNTY OF MARIN was\n8 the “moving force” behind an underlying violation of a constitutional right.  First, Plaintiff TASCA\n9 was initially taken into custody pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5150 (“section\n10 5150\").  Section 5150 allows a peace officer to take a person into custody if he or she “as a result\n11 of mental disorder, is a danger to others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled.”  Cal.Welf. &\n12 Inst. Code §5150.  Then, Plaintiff TASCA threatened to “slit her wrists” and began banging her head\n13 against the wall.  Schemmel Depo. 14:4-15:7.  Thus, jail staff had reason to believe that Plaintiff\n14 TASCA was a danger to herself or others.  Additionally, Plaintiff TASCA refused to voluntarily\n15 exchange her clothes for a safety garment and began chanting and yelling at the Deputies.\n16 Furthermore, TASCA was not subjected to a strip search.  Thus, similar to Plaintiff CHATOIAN,\n17 it was not a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to have male Deputies hold her\n18 down while female deputies removed her clothes and provided her with a safety smock. \n19 Deputes also had reason to believe that Plaintiff RASMUSSEN was a danger to herself.\n20 First, she told jail staff that she was diagnosed with clinical depression.  Garret Depo. 59:21-24.  She\n21 was also intoxicated and told the Deputies, “just shoot me.”  Garrett Depo. 58:11-59:9.  Based on\n22 her behavior, jail staff determined that she may be suicidal.  Garrett Depo. 58:6-10.  Furthermore,\n23 unlike Plaintiffs CHATOIAN and TASCA, Plaintiff RASMUSSEN voluntarily exchanged her\n24 clothes for a safety garment.  Garrett Depo. 60:23-61:7.  Finally, during the clothing exchange the\n25 deputies did not inspect or search Plaintiff RASMUSSEN’s body to determine if she was concealing\n26 weapons or contraband.  Goss Depo. 25:25-26:3.  Plaintiff RASMUSSEN was not subjected to strip\n27 and/or body cavity search but instead was merely placed in a safety cell and required to exchange\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 her clothing for a safety garment.\nWEIBERG & DELEHANT\nA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nP.O.

To the contrary, the conduct of the Deputies who placed Plaintiffs\n4 CHATOIAN, TASCA and/or RASMUSSEN in a safety cell demonstrates that they followed the\n5 policy of the Marin County Jail.  Moreover, as demonstrated in Anderson and Hill, that policy and\n6 the conduct of the Deputies conforms with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Therefore, there\n7 is no evidence of a widespread custom and/or practice of violating the constitutional rights of\n8 persons placed in safety cells at the Marin County Jail.  \n9 Based on all of the foregoing, the COUNTY OF MARIN is entitled to summary judgment\n10 for the claims of Plaintiff RASMUSSEN arising from Monell-type liability in Count One and Count\n11 Two of the First Amended Complaint.  \n12 IV.\n13 DEFENDANT MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT IS AN IMPROPER\nPARTY\n14\n15 It is well settled that for the purposes of a section 1983 action, the term \"persons\" does not\n16 encompass municipal departments.  Vance v. County of Santa Clara, 928 F.Supp. 993, 996 (ND Cal.\n17 1996).  In that regard, \"[n]aming a municipal department as a defendant is not an appropriate means\n18 of pleading a §1983 action against a municipality.\"  Id. quoting Stump v. Gates, 777 F. Supp. 808,\n19 816 (D. Colo. 1991).  Therefore, Defendant MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT is an\n20 improper party and should be dismissed from this action on that basis as well.\n21 V.\n22 THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH SUPERVISORY \nLIABILITY AGAINST SHERIFF DOYLE\n23\n24 Liability may be imposed on a supervisor under §1983 only if (1) the supervisor personally\n25 participated in the deprivation of constitutional rights or (2) the supervisor knew of the violations\n26 and failed to act to prevent them or (3) the supervisor implemented a policy “so deficient that the\n27 policy itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights and is the moving force of the constitutional\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 violation.” Redman v.

With\n3 respect to the latter, an unconstitutional policy cannot be proved by proof of a single incident “unless\n4 proof of the incident includes proof that it was caused by an existing, unconstitutional policy.” City\n5 of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823-24; 105 S.Ct. 2427 (1985).\n6 Here, there is no evidence that Defendant SHERIFF DOYLE personally participated in the\n7 alleged wrongdoing and/or knew of the alleged violations and failed to prevent them.  Additionally,\n8 as demonstrated above, there is no evidence that SHERIFF DOYLE implemented a policy that was\n9 “so deficient that the policy itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights...”  Furthermore, assuming\n10 arguendo that Plaintiffs can establish a violation of their underlying constitutional rights,  there is\n11 no evidence that a policy implemented by SHERIFF DOYLE was the “moving force” behind the\n12 violation.  Defendants incorporate by reference the arguments set forth in sections III(A)(2) and\n13 III(B)(1) above.   Rather, the policies regarding strip searches and safety cells are constitutional on\n14 their face.  There also is no evidence of a widespread custom or practice of deputies at the Marin\n15 County Jail engaging in conduct that violates the constitutional rights of the inmates.  Defendants\n16 incorporate by reference the arguments set forth in sections III(A)(3) and III(B)(2) above Thus\n17 Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate supervisory liability against SHERIFF DOYLE.  Therefore, Defendant\n18 SHERIFF DOYLE respectfully requests that the Court grant Defendants’ Motion for Summary\n19 Judgment.\n20 VI.\n21 SHERIFF DOYLE IS ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n22 Qualified immunity serves to shield public officials “from undue interference with their\n23 duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 806,\n24 102 S.Ct. 2727 (1982).  The defense provides immunity from suit, not merely from liability.\n25 Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806 (1985).  A plaintiff has the burden of proving\n26 the rights he claims are clearly established.  Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 197, 104 S.Ct. 3012\n27 (1984). Qualified immunity is a far-reaching protection for government officers which safeguards\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.

If a reasonable public officer in the position of the defendant could\n2 have believed that his conduct was lawful in light of clearly established case law and the information\n3 he possessed at the time of incident at issue, he is protected from liability by qualified immunity.\n4 Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534 (1991); Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 125\n5 S.Ct. 596, 599-600 (2004); Headwaters Forest Defense v. County of Humboldt, 276 F.3d 1125, 1129\n6 (9th Cir. 2002) (citations and quotations omitted).\n7 In ruling on the issue of qualified immunity, a Court must first consider the threshold\n8 question: “Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged\n9 show the officer’s conduct violated a constitutional right?”  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121\n10 S. Ct. 2151 (2001).  Then, the Court’s next step is to “ask whether the right was clearly established.”\n11 Id.  At this point, the qualified immunity inquiry has two parts: (1) Was the law governing the state\n12 officials’ conduct clearly established? (2) Under that law, could a reasonable state official have\n13 believed his conduct was lawful?  Marquez v. Gutierrez, 322 F.3d. 689, 692 (9th Cir. 2003);\n14 Brosseau, 125 U.S. at 201.\n15 “Because the focus is on whether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful,\n16 reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.”  Brosseau, 125\n17 U.S. at 599.  Additionally, “[i]f the law at the time did not clearly establish that officer’s conduct\n18 would violate the Constitution, the officer should not be subject to liability, or, indeed, even the\n19 burdens of litigation.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Specifically, in Brosseau, the United States Supreme\n20 Court determined that plaintiff failed to cite to “particularized” or specific case law because none\n21 of the three cases cited by the plaintiff “squarely governs the case here; they do not suggest that\n22 Brosseau’s actions fell in the ‘hazy border’ between excessive and acceptable force.”  Id.\n23 In this case, SHERIFF DOYLE is entitled to qualified immunity.  First, there is no evidence\n24 that he personally participated in the alleged violations.  Second, Plaintiffs cannot establish an\n25 underlying constitutional violation.  Therefore, Defendant SHERIFF DOYLE is entitled to qualified\n26 immunity based on the first prong..\n27 Additionally, assuming arguendo Plaintiffs can demonstrate an underlying violation, there\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 was no clearly established case law that would place a reasonable officer on notice that the actions\nWEIBERG & DELEHANT\nA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nP.O.

First, regarding the strip-search policy and practices of the\n2 Marin County Jail, the United States Supreme court addressed and upheld the practice of strip\n3 searching all pre-trial inmates of a jail after contact visits without reasonable suspicion that the\n4 particular detainee was concealing contraband in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558-60 (1979),\n5 discussed supra.  Thereafter, the Ninth Circuit enumerated a limited exception to the rule\n6 enumerated in Bell that prohibited strip searches of persons who were freshly arrested for minor\n7 crimes unless there was reasonable suspicion that a particular person was concealing weapons or\n8 contraband.  See Giles,  746 F.2d 614; Kennedy, 901 F.2d 702; Fuller, 950 F.2d 1437, discussed\n9 supra.\n10 None of the case law regarding strip searches would place a reasonable officer on notice that\n11 the policy or practice of the Marin County Jail regarding strip searches violates the Fourth and/or\n12 Fourteenth Amendments.  First, the policy and practice regarding strip searches follows the\n13 exception to Bell that was set forth in Giles, Kenney and Fuller that prohibits strip searches of a\n14 person arrested for minor crimes not including violence, drugs or weapons prior to his or her\n15 arraignment, discussed supra.  Additionally, the policy and practice  includes additional protections\n16 for these persons in the form of a requirement for documented supervisory approval, prohibits\n17 viewing an arrestee during the “clothing exchange,” and prohibits conducting strip searches of\n18 individuals arrested on crimes not involving violence, drugs or weapons even after they are placed\n19 in general jail population.  If anything, the policy and practices  implemented by the Marin County\n20 Jail includes the protections set forth in the case law and additionally protections that are not\n21 mandated by that same, or any other, case law.  Thus, the clearly established case law would not\n22 place a reasonable officer on notice that the actions of SHERIFF DOYLE were unconstitutional; if\n23 anything, it would instruct a reasonable officer that the policy of the Marin County Jail not only\n24 complies with existing law, but also includes additional protections that are not mandated by any\n25 existing law.  Therefore, SHERIFF DOYLE is entitled to qualified immunity on the issue of strip\n26 searches.\n27 There also is no clearly established case law that would place a reasonable officer on notice\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 that the policy or practice regarding placement of arrestees in safety cells was unconstitutional.

See Anderson, 45 F.3d 1310; Hill, 311 F.3d 899, discussed supra.  In this\n3 case, the policy of the Marin Count Jail states “[i]nmates will be allowed to retain sufficient clothing,\n4 or be provided with a suitably designed ‘safety garment’, to provide for their personal privacy unless\n5 specific identifiable risks to the inmate’s safety or to the security of the facility are documented.”\n6 This is consistent with the case-law regarding safety cell placements.  Specifically, the case law\n7 permits correctional officers to remove the clothing of an inmate when he or she is placed in a safety\n8 cell.  Anderson 45 F.3d at 1313.  The case law also permits male officers to be present where a\n9 female is uncooperative and unruly.  See Hill 311 F.3d 903.  Thus, the practice of the Marin County\n10 Jail to require clothing exchange for a safety smock with suicidal inmates, with male officers present\n11 in emergent circumstances, does not violate clearly established case law.  Lastly, there is no evidence\n12 that inmates are strip searched in connection with placement in safety cells.  There was no case law\n13 that would place a reasonable officer on notice that the policy of the Marin County Jail was so\n14 deficient that it  violates the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs CHATOIAN, TASCA and/or\n15 RASMUSSEN.\n16    Defendants respectfully submit that there is no evidence that demonstrates that the policies\n17 or practices of the Marin County Jail are unconstitutional.  Assuming arguendo that the policies or\n18 practices are unconstitutional, there is no clearly established case law that would place a reasonable\n19 officer on notice that those policies are unconstitutional.  Therefore, SHERIFF DOYLE is entitled\n20 to qualified immunity for the claims asserted in Count One and Count Two of Plaintiffs’ First\n21 Amended Complaint.\n22 VII.\n23 PLAINTIFFS CHATOIAN, RASMUSSEN AND RUSSELL CANNOT ESTABLISH A\nVIOLATION OF STATE LAW\n24\n25 Penal Code section 4030 prohibits strip searches of certain individuals who are brought into\n26 a jail facility. In this case, Plaintiffs CHATOIAN, RASMUSSEN and RUSSELL assert claims\n27 against SHERIFF DOYLE “for enacting and implementing policies that violate Penal Codes section\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 4030 and Civil Code section 52.1.”  December 14, 2004 Order p. 19:16-20, Req.

Therefore, the only conduct relevant to the state law claims of Plaintiffs is that of\n4 SHERIFF DOYLE in revising and implementing the policy regarding the conduct of strip searches.\n5  A. There Is No Evidence That Sheriff Doyle Enacted a Policy That Violates Penal Code\nSection 4030 Because the Policy Prohibits Strip Searches of Arrestees Who Are\n6 Charged with Crimes Not Involving Weapons, Controlled Substances or Violence\n7 Penal Code section 4030 was enacted to regulate booking searches – i.e., the searches to\n8 which all arrestees are subjected regardless of whether they will be released after booking.\n9 Specifically, Penal Code section 4030(f) prohibits strip searching an individual arrested on a\n10 misdemeanor offense not involving weapons, controlled substances or violence “prior to placement\n11 in the general jail population” unless a peace officer has determined that there is reasonable\n12 suspicion that the individual is concealing contraband.  Cal.Penal.Code §4030(f).  Additionally,\n13 Penal Code section 4030(g) prohibits placement of certain individuals in the general jail population\n14 unless three specific provisions have been met.6  See Cal.Penal.Code § 4030 (g).\n15 Here, the written policy of the Marin County Jail does not violate Penal Code section 4030.\n16 First, the policy prohibits strip searches of inmates who are arrested for offenses not involving\n17 weapons, violence and/or narcotics.  McQueeny Decl. Ex. A, p. §(a)(1).  Additionally, when jail staff\n18 conduct the “clothing exchange” that occurs when an inmate is “placed” in general jail population,\n19 the inmate “may not be viewed, observed or monitored by any deputy or staff member during the\n20 exchange and/or shower, unless there is reasonable suspicion that the inmate is concealing a weapon\n21 or contraband.”  Id. at p. 2.  Thus, there is nothing in the policy which is inconsistent with the\n22 provision of Penal Code section 4030 that prohibits strip searching an inmate arrested on a\n23 misdemeanor offense not involving weapons, controlled substances or violence “prior to placement\n24 in the general jail population.”  Therefore, none of the actions of SHERIFF DOYLE, in his role in\n25\n26\n6\n  Other cases involving strip searches at county jails dispute whether “prior to placement in the general jail\npopulation” includes only physical placement in general population versus some point after the inmate is “classified”\n27\nfor general population but before actual physical delivery.  See e.g. Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, Case No.\nLAW OFFICES OF 3:03-CV-01840 (N.D.Cal. September 22, 2005); Req. Jud. Not. Ex. B.  In this case, however, it does not matter which\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28\nWEIBERG & DELEHANT reading the Court adopts because the policy prohibits strip searches in either case.  \nA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nP.O.

Therefore, SHERIFF DOYLE is entitled to\n6 judgment as a matter of law for the claims of Plaintiff KORISSA RUSSELL arising out of her\n7 alleged strip search at the Marin County Jail. \n8 B. There Is No Evidence That Sheriff Doyle Enacted a Policy That Violates Penal Code\nSection 4030 for the Claims of Plaintiffs CHATOIAN and RASMUSSEN That They\n9 Were  Placed  in  a  Safety  Cell  Because  They  Were  Not  “Strip  Searched”  as\nContemplated by Penal Code Section 4030\n10\n11 Plaintiffs CHATOIAN and RASMUSSEN do not claim that they were strip searched prior\n12 to placement in the general jail population.  Rather, these two Plaintiffs claim that they were “strip\n13 searched”  when members of the Sheriff’s Department conducted a clothing exchange upon\n14 placement into a safety cell.\n15 Penal Code section 4030 does not prohibit deputies from conducting a “clothing exchange”\n16 during the placement of an inmate into a safety cell.  First, Penal Code section 4030 defines a “strip\n17 search” as “a search which requires a person to remove or arrange some or all of his or her clothing\n18 so as to permit visual inspection of the underclothing, breasts, buttocks, or genitalia of such person.”\n19 Cal.Penal.Code §4030(c).\n20 There is nothing in the policies of the Marin County Jail that violate this provision of Penal\n21 Code section 4030.  First, as demonstrated above, the strip search policy conforms with Penal Code\n22 section 4030.  Additionally, the policy regarding safety cell placements does not authorize the\n23 conduct of a “strip search” outside the scope of the policy regarding strip searches.  Specifically, the\n24 only reference to removal of clothing is “[i]nmates will be allowed to retain sufficient clothing, or\n25 be provided with a suitably designed ‘safety garment’, to provide for their personal privacy unless\n26 specific identifiable risks to the inmates safety or security are documented.”  McQueeny Decl. Ex.\n27 B, p. 2.  Furthermore, the policy is in accord with the regulation promulgated by the California Board\nLAW OFFICES OF\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28 of Corrections that states “[i]nmates shall be allowed to retain sufficient clothing, or be provided\nWEIBERG & DELEHANT\nA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n350 UNIVERSITY AVE., SUITE 200\nP.O.

Code\n3 Regs. Tit. 15, §1055. Thus, the policy regarding strip searches only authorizes removal of clothing\n4 where there are documented safety or security risks.  Therefore, nothing in that policy falls within\n5 the ambit of protected “strip searches” that are contemplated by Penal Code section 4030 because\n6 the removal of clothing is not conducted “so as to permit visual inspection”, but rather is to address\n7 specific documented safety and/or security concerns as set forth in title 15, section 1055 of the\n8 California Code of Regulations. \n9 Based on the foregoing, Defendants submit that there is no evidence that SHERIFF DOYLE\n10 revised and/or implemented policies that violate Penal Code section 4030.  Therefore, Defendants\n11 respectfully submit that SHERIFF DOYLE is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count 4 of\n12 Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint. \n13 C. There Is No Evidence That Sheriff Doyle Enacted Violated California Civil Code\nSection 52.1\n14\n15 Plaintiffs must demonstrate an underlying violation of state or federal law in order to prevail\n16 on their claims for violation of California Civil Code section 52.1.  See Cal.Civ.Code §52.1.  As set\n17 forth in sections III(A)-(B) and VIII(A)-(B) above, Plaintiffs have failed to establish an underlying\n18 violation  of  a  constitutional  right  and/or  Penal  Code  section  4030.    Therefore,  Defendants\n19 respectfully submit that there is no evidence to establish a violation of California Civil Code section\n20 52.1 and, therefore, respectfully request that the court enter judgment as a matter of law on the\n21 claims arising out of California Civil Code section 52.1 in Count 3 and Count 5 of Plaintiffs’ First\n22 Amended Complaint.\n23 D. There Is No Evidence That the County of Marin Violated State Law\n24 Plaintiffs also assert claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against the COUNTY OF\n25 MARIN for violations of state law.7  Defendants respectfully submit that there is no evidence and\n26 Plaintiffs cannot establish that the COUNTY OF MARIN violated any provisions of state law.\n27\nLAW OFFICES OF 7  The Court previously ruled that Defendant COUNTY OF MARIN is immune from liability for damages\nPORTER, SCOTT, 28\nWEIBERG & DELEHANT arising out of claims asserted under state law.

Case No. C04-02790 MJJ \n\n \nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 33      Filed 02/01/2005     Page 2 of 16\n1 DEPARTMENT, MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF ROBERT T. DOYLE, Individually and in \n2 His  Official  Capacity,  MARIN  COUNTY  SHERIFF’S  DEPUTIES  sued  under  their \n3 fictitious  names  as  DOES  1  THROUGH  100,  and  ROES  1  THROUGH  20,  for \n4 violations of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights resulting from application of Marin County’s \n5 and the Sheriff’s policies, practices, and customs concerning the use of strip searches \n6 and  visual  body  cavity  searches  in  Marin  County  Jails.    Plaintiffs  seek  an  order \n7 declaring illegal defendants’ policy of subjecting detainees in their custody to strip and \n8 visual  body  cavity  searches  before  they  are  arraigned  and  without  having  any \n9 reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of contraband.  \n10 Defendants’ strip search and visual body cavity search policies, practices, and \n11 customs  violate  plaintiffs’  rights  secured  to  them  by  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \n12 Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution  and  entitle  plaintiffs  to  recover \n13 damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983).   \n14 Additionally, plaintiffs include supplemental claims under California state law \n15 against defendants: 1) for violation of California Penal Code § 4030 which prohibits \n16 pre-arraignment strip searches of most misdemeanants and provides for minimum \n17 damages of $1,000 for each illegal search; and 2) for violation of the Bane Civil Rights \n18 Act (California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b)) pursuant to which each plaintiff denied a \n19 statutory, state, federal, or constitutional right is entitled to recover a minimum of \n20 $4,000 for each violation. \n \n21   JURISDICTION \n22 1.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and the \n23 Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is \n24 founded upon 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory \n25 and constitutional provisions.   \n26    2.  The court has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims under \n27 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \n28  \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

The  amount  in  controversy  exceeds  $10,000,  excluding  interest  and \n2 costs. \nPARTIES \n3\n4.  Plaintiff  DARCELLE  L.  CHATOIAN,  CYNTHIA  TASCA,  KORISSA \n4\nRUSSELL,  CORIN  RASMUSSEN  and  all  those  similarly  situated,  are,  and  at  all \n5\nmaterial times herein, were citizens of the United States and residents of the state of \n6\nCalifornia  who  were  arrested  within  the  period  beginning  on  July  12,  2002,  and \n7\ncontinuing to this date, and who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity \n8\nsearches at a Marin County Jail (hereinafter referred to as the “Marin County Jail”), \n9\nprior to being arraigned and/or without the defendants first having, and recording in \n10\nwriting, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or \n11\nweapons. \n12\n5.  Some plaintiffs, including DARCELLE L. CHATOIAN, CYNTHIA TASCA, \n13\nand  CORIN  RASMUSSEN  were  confined  by  defendants,  after  they  were  strip \n14\nsearched, in cells while they were nude in violation of state statues and the state and \n15\nfederal statutory and constitutions. \n16\n6.  Defendant MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF ROBERT T. DOLYE is, and at all \n17\nmaterial times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of the COUNTY OF \n18\nMARIN, responsible for administering the Jail facilities and for making, overseeing, and \n19\nimplementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the \n20\noperation of the Marin County Jail.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities. \n21\n7.  Defendants MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their \n22\nfictitious names (Does 1 through 100) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at \n23\nthe Marin County Jail, subjected plaintiffs to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body \n24\ncavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that \n25\nthe  searches  would  be  productive  of  contraband  or  weapons.      Furthermore, \n26\nDefendants  MARIN  COUNTY  SHERIFF  DEPUTIES  sued  herein  by  their  fictitious \n27\nnames (Does 1 through 100) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the Marin \n28\nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

At  all  material  times  mentioned  herein,  each  of  the  defendants  was \n3 acting under the color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, \n4 policies, customs and usages of the state of California, the COUNTY OF MARIN \n5 and/or the MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT.  \n6 9.  Defendants whose names are not now known and who are sued by the \n7 fictitious names of ROES 1 through 20, are all agents and/or employees of one or \n8 another of the other named defendants who ordered, condoned, authorized, covered \n9 up, or were otherwise associated with the implementation of the illegal policy and \n10 practices relating to strip searches and nude confinement complained of herein.   \n11 10.  Defendant COUNTY OF MARIN is, and at all material times referred to \n12 herein, was a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official \n13 policy  or  custom  or  practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of \n14 wrongs  complained  of  herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein alleged.  \n15 Plaintiffs’ allegations against the COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the \n16 SHERIFF  and  his  DEPUTIES  and  on  acts  and  omissions  of  persons  who  are \n17 COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’S breach of its duty to protect plaintiffs \n18 from the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees. \n19 11.  Defendants MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT and MARIN \n20 COUNTY SHERIFF ROBERT T. DOYLE, in his Individual and Official Capacity, also \n21 maintained  or  permitted  an  official  policy  or  custom  of  causing  or  permitting  the \n22 occurrence  of  the  types  of  wrongs  complained  of  herein,  which  wrongs  damaged \n23 plaintiffs as herein alleged.   \n24 12.  Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, commencing on or \n25 after July 12, 2002, and continuing to this date, were subjected by defendants to pre-\n26 arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, and \n27 recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of \n28 contraband or weapons.  Some of the similarly situated plaintiffs were confined by \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Plaintiffs demand a jury trial in this action. \n5 FACTS \n6 14.  On or about late July or early August 2003, plaintiff CYNTHIA TASCA \n7 (hereinafter referred to as “plaintiff” or “TASCA” was arrested allegedly for disturbing \n8 the peace, a misdemeanor, and transported to the Marin County Jail where she was \n9 directed to remove all of her clothes to be strip searched.  When she refused to \n10 remove her clothes she was forcibly strip searched and confined, nude, in a cell, prior \n11 to her arraignment. \n12 15.  On  or  about  November  2,  2003,  plaintiff  DARCELLE  L.  CHATOIAN \n13 (hereinafter referred to as “plaintiff” or “CHATOIAN”) was arrested for allegedly driving \n14 under the influence in Mill Valley, California.  Plaintiff CHATOIAN was taken to the \n15 Marin County Jail in San Rafael, California, where all of her clothing was forcibly \n16 removed by three (3) male officers and she was subjected to a visual body cavity \n17 search  then  placed  in  a  cell,  nude,  for  six  (6)  hours  until  she  was  removed  and \n18 released from custody.   \n19 16.  Within six (6) months of her arrest, plaintiff CHATOIAN filed a group \n20 Government  Tort  Claim  for  herself  and  for  all  persons  similarly  situated.    Plaintiff \n21 CHATOIAN’s group claim was denied on or about March 3, 2004, allowing the filing of \n22 this complaint for state statute and state constitutional violations.   \n23 17.  On or about March 10, 2004, plaintiff KORISSA RUSSELL (hereinafter \n24 referred to as “plaintiff” or ‘RUSSELL”) was arrested by members of the Marin County \n25 Sheriff’s Department on two misdemeanor violations.  Plaintiff RUSSELL was taken to \n26 the Marin County Jail in San Rafael, California where she was subjected to a visual \n27 body cavity search. \n28 18.  On August 17 2004, plaintiff RUSSELL filed a class Government Tort \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N. California Blvd., \nSuite 1020 \nWalnut Creek, CA  94596  FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  5\nTFEALX:  ((992255))  994477--11113417   Chatoian v. County of Marin, et al.  Case No. C04-02790 MJJ \n\n \nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 33      Filed 02/01/2005     Page 6 of 16\n1 Claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated. \n2 19.  Plaintiff RUSSELL’S class claim was denied on September 13, 2004, \n3 allowing the filing of this complaint for state statute and state constitutional violations.   \n4 20.  On  or  about  July  4,  2004,  plaintiff CORIN RASMUSSEN (hereinafter \n5 referred to as “plaintiff” or “RASMUSSEN”) was arrested for allegedly driving under the \n6 influence on Highway 101 in Marin County, California.  Plaintiff RASMUSSEN was \n7 taken to the Marin County Jail in San Rafael, California, where officers placed her in a \n8 “safety cell” and ordered her to remove all her clothing.  While RASMUSSEN removed \n9 her clothing she was observed by male deputies.  She then was left alone, naked for \n10 almost an hour, after which she was given something which resembled a vest which, \n11 though partially covering her, left her essentially naked.  She remained in the “safety \n12 cell” for approximately eight hours before she was placed in a holding cell with a male \n13 prisoner.  During RASMUSSEN’s entire tenure in the “safety cell” she was observed \n14 through a video surveillance camera.  \n15 21.  On August 5, 2004, plaintiff RASMUSSEN filed a class Government Tort \n16 Claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated. \n17 22.  Plaintiff RASMUSSEN’s class claim was denied on or about September \n18 13, 2004, allowing the filing of this complaint for state statute and state constitutional \n19 violations.   \n20 23.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  therefore  allege,  that  defendants  routinely \n21 follow  their  policy,  practice,  and  custom  of  subjecting  pre-arraignment  detainees, \n22 including  plaintiffs,  to  strip  and  visual  body  cavity  searches  without  having,  and \n23 recording  in  writing,  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  search  will  be  productive  of \n24 contraband or weapons.   \n25 24.  Plaintiffs  are  further  informed  and  believe,  and  thereon  allege,  that \n26 defendants routinely follow their policy, practice and custom of confining detainees, \n27 including  plaintiffs,  naked  in  cells  following  subjecting  them  to  visual  body  cavity \n28 searches. \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N. California Blvd., \nSuite 1020 \nWalnut Creek, CA  94596  FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  6\nTFEALX:  ((992255))  994477--11113417   Chatoian v. County of Marin, et al.  Case No. C04-02790 MJJ \n\n \nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 33      Filed 02/01/2005     Page 7 of 16\n1 25.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants \n2 have the ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, \n3 while  in  defendants’  custody  at  the  Marin  County  Jail  since  July  12,  2002,  were \n4 subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment \n5 without  defendants  first  having  and  recording,  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the \n6 searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n7 26.  Defendant MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF ROBERT T. DOYLE is personally \n8 responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, \n9 and custom pursuant to which some of the plaintiffs herein were subjected to the \n10 searches complained of herein.  \n11 27.  As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, \n12 plaintiffs, and each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and \n13 emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and state \n14 and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and are entitled to recover damages \n15 according to proof but, at a minimum, $1,000 as specified in California Penal Code § \n16 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b). \n17 28.   As a result of being confined, naked, in a cell as complained of herein, \n18 following being strip searched, each of the plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and \n19 emotional distress and violation of due process of law and state and federal statutory \n20 and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to proof, but a \n21 minimum of $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b). \n22 CLASS CLAIMS \n23 29.  The  strip  and  visual  body  cavity  searches  to  which  plaintiffs  were \n24 subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants \n25 MARIN  COUNTY  SHERIFF  ROBERT  T.  DOYLE,  MARIN  COUNTY  SHERIFF’S \n26 DEPARTMENT,  COUNTY  OF  MARIN,  the  individual  SHERIFF’S  DEPUTIES  sued \n27 herein by the fictitious names 1 through 100, and the individuals whose names are not \n28 now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES 1 through 20.

County of Marin, et al.  Case No. C04-02790 MJJ \n\n \nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 33      Filed 02/01/2005     Page 8 of 16\n1 searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the \n2 alleged offenses for which plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or \n3 not plaintiffs were eligible for cite and release under Penal Code § 853.6, without \n4 regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for and/or were released on their own \n5 recognizance.    Furthermore,  the  searches  complained  of  herein  were  performed \n6 without  defendants  having  a  reasonable  belief  that  the  plaintiffs  so  searched \n7 possessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable \n8 belief that the searches would produce contraband, and those facts being articulated \n9 and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.  \n10 30.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons \n11 similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California \n12 Code of Civil Procedure § 382.   \n13 31.  The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and \n14 including July 12, 2002, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated \n15 and the practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-\n16 arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity search at the Marin County Jail without \n17 defendants having, and recording, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be \n18 productive of contraband or weapons. \n19 32.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n20 members of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  \n21 Plaintiffs do not know the exact number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n22 believe, and thereupon allege, that there are more than 10 persons per day who are \n23 arrested  by  defendants  and/or  in  the  custody of defendants and subjected to the \n24 searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom \n25 relating to said searches.   \n26   33.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(a), \n27 plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  there  are  many \n28 questions  of  fact  common  to  the  class  including,  but  not  limited  to:  (1)  whether \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(a), \n15 plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  there  are  many \n16 questions  of  law  common  to  the  class  including,  but  not  limited  to:  (1)  whether \n17 defendants  may  perform  visual  body  cavity  searches  on  persons  prior  to  their \n18 arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to \n19 believe any particular inmate has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which \n20 would likely be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants may \n21 perform visual body cavity searches on persons without first reasonably relating the \n22 use of the visual body cavity search to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the \n23 security of the jail and determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that \n24 interest; (3) whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the \n25 search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating \n26 plaintiffs’  State  and  Federal  constitutional  rights  and  the  protections  afforded  to \n27 plaintiffs  under  California  Penal  Code  section  4030;  and,  (4)  whether  or  not \n28 defendants’ strip search policy and procedure is in accordance with the State and/or \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n3 claims of the representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, \n4 prior to arraignment, without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity \n5 search would produce drugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting \n6 any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-approved writing), and named \n7 plaintiffs were placed in cells, nude, for extended periods of time (in excess of one \n8 hour).  Representative plaintiffs have the same interests and suffered the same type of \n9 injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose because of defendants’ \n10 policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity \n11 searches before arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable \n12 suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Additionally, \n13 plaintiffs, in accordance with defendants’ policy, practice, and custom, were improperly \n14 and unjustifiably confined, nude, in cells for extended periods of time.   Plaintiffs’ \n15 claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  \n16 Each class member suffered actual damages either as a result of being subjected to a \n17 visual  body  cavity  search  and/or  as  a  result  of  being  improperly  and  unjustifiably \n18 placed and confined in a cell nude.  The actual damages suffered by representative \n19 plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by each class \n20 member.   \n21 36.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n22 representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ \n23 interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   \n24 37.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \n25 prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n26 risk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \n27 class would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the \n28 class.   \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \n2 prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n3 risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which \n4 would, as a practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other \n5 members of the class to protect their interests. \n6   39.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(2), \n7 plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted \n8 on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final \n9 injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.   \n10 40.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this \n11 class  action  is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  equitable \n12 adjudication  of  the  controversy  between  the  parties.    Plaintiffs  are  informed  and \n13 believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of the class in individually \n14 controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class members \n15 would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n16 believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small \n17 that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \n18 thereupon allege, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \n19 represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is \n20 desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the \n21 same location; i.e., the MARIN COUNTY JAIL.  It will promote judicial efficiency to \n22 resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple \n23 courts.   \n24   41.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs \n25 are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  the  identities  of  the  class \n26 members may be ascertained from records maintained by the COUNTY OF MARIN \n27 and  defendant  SHERIFF  ROBERT  T.  DOYLE  and  defendant  MARIN  COUNTY \n28 SHERIFF’S  DEPARTMENT.    Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that records \n4 of, and maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body \n5 cavity search, when the search occurred, where the search occurred, whether any \n6 reasonable  suspicion  for  the  search  existed  and  was  recorded  in  a  supervisor-\n7 approved writing, when persons searched were arraigned, the charges on which such \n8 persons were arrested, whether persons were confined in cells nude, the justification \n9 recorded for placing individuals in cells nude, how long individuals remained in cells \n10 nude, and what treatment they received while so confined.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n11 believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing information is contained in \n12 defendants’ computer system and that the information necessary to identify the class \n13 members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or \n14 release from custody, is readily available from said computer system.   \n15 42.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class \n16 members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, \n17 including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable \n18 effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ \n19 computer  records  contain  a  last  known  address  for  class  members.    Plaintiffs \n20 contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such last known \n21 address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class \n22 members of the following: \n23 1.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class; \n24 2.  The nature of the action; \n25 3.  Their right to \"opt out\" of the action within a given time, in which event \n26 they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \n27 4.

Doyle in this section 1983 case concerning intake and housing procedures at the Marin County \n19  Jail.  Plaintiffs oppose the motion.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS IN PART \n20  and DENIES IN PART Defendants' motion. \n21  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n22  Plaintiffs Darcelle Chatoian and Cynthia Tasca allege that as prearraignment detainees at \n23  Marin County Jail, they were strip searched, subjected to visual body cavity searches, and placed \n24  naked in cells, pursuant to the policies and practices ofthe entity Defendants, as implemented by the \n25  individual Defendants.  Plaintiffs claim that no reasonable suspicion existed that they possessed \n26  weapons or contraband. \n27  On July 12, 2004, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against Defendants County of Marin, the \n28  Marin County Sheriffs Department, Marin County Sheriff Robert T. Doyle (in both his individual \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 2 of 22\n1  and official capacities), and unnamed Marin County Sheriffs Deputies.  Against all Defendants, \n2  Plaintiffs allege that their treatment at the Marin County Jail violated their Fourth and Fourteenth \n3  Amendment rights, recoverable under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.  Plaintiffs also allege that their \n4  treatment violated California Civil Code sections 52 and 52.1 and California Penal Code section \n5  4030. \n6  Defendants Robert T. Doyle and the County of Marin filed the instant motion to dismiss, \n7  arguing, under several different theories, that said Defendants are immune from liability.  Defendants \n8  also contend that Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred under California Government Code section \n9  335.1.  Additionally, Defendants move for a more definite statement, pursuant to Federal Rule of \n10  Civil Procedure 12(e), regarding Plaintiffs' allegations that the class period includes all persons \n.... \n... \n11  injured on or since June 23, 2000 . \n= \n0  •  12  At the October 19, 2004 hearing on the instant motion, the Court asked the parties to submit \nU  E \n.... \n.. @ \n.<.J.   \"  13  supplemental briefing on certain provisions of the California Code of Regulations, raised by defense \n....  u \n.. ~0  \n'\"  u  14  counsel at oral argument, and on whether the immunities set forth in the California Tort Claims Act \n.~  \n~ \ni5 \n.'.C\".I.,j    E  15  adhere, if at all, to public employees sued in their individual, as well as their official capacities.

See Cahill v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337 (9th Cir. 1996).  Dismissal of an \n21  action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where it \"appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff \n22  can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\"  Levine v. \n23  Diamanthuset, Inc., 950 F.2d 1478, 1482 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting Conley v.  Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, \n24  45-6 (1957)).  In reviewing such a motion, the Court must assume all factual allegations to be true \n25  and must construe them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See North Star v. \n26  Arizona Corp. Comm., 720 F.2d 578, 580 (9th Cir. 1983).  The Court will dismiss the complaint or \n27  any claim in it without leave to amend only if \"it is absolutely clear that the deficiencies of the \n28  complaint could not be cured by amendment.\" Noll v. Carlson, 809 F.2d 1446, 1448 (9th Cir. 1987). \n2 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 3 of 22\n1  In the context of a motion to dismiss, review is limited to the contents ofthe complaint.  Allarcom \n2  Pay Television, Ltd. v. Gen. Instrument Corp., 69 F.3d 381, 385 (9th Cir. 1995).  However, matters \n3  properly presented to the court, such as those attached to the complaint and incorporated within its \n4  allegations, may be considered as part of the motion to dismiss.  See Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. \n5  Richard Feiner & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1989). \n6  Motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim \"are generally viewed with disfavor.\"  Ramos, \n7  857 F.

Eleventh Amendment Immunity \n19  As a threshold matter, the Court must determine whether or not Sheriff Robert T. Doyle is a \n20  state actor such that he is immune, pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, from section 1983 liability. \n21  A.  Sheriff Robert T. Doyle Is Not Immune From Section 1983 Liability. \n22  Sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment creates a subject matter jurisdictional \n23  hurdle for plaintiffs suing state governments in federal court.  See Pennhurst State School & Hasp. v. \n24  Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 98 (1984) (declaring that \"the principle of sovereign immunity is a \n25  constitutional limitation on the federal judicial power established in Art. III\").  Specifically, \"[t]he \n26  Eleventh Amendment bars suits which seek either damages or injunctive relief against a state, an \n27  'arm of the state,' its instrumentalities, or its agencies.\"  Franceschi v. Schwartz, 57 F.3d 828, 831 \n28  (9thCir. 1995) (citing Durning v. Citibank, NA., 950F.2d 1419,1422-23 (9thCir. 1991)).  The \n3 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 4 of 22\n1  Supreme Court has held that an individual defendant acting in his official capacity receives the same \n2  immunity as the government agency for which he works.  Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991). \n3  This means that individuals acting as policymakers on behalf of a state cannot be liable under section \n4  1983.  McMillan v. Monroe County. Alabama, 520 U.S. 781 (1998). \n5  Here, Defendants contend that Defendant Robert Doyle, the Sheriff of Marin County, is a \n6  policy maker for the State of California, not for the County of Marin, and that as such, he has \n7  Eleventh Amendment immunity from section 1983 liability.  Defendants rely, almost exclusively, on \n8  a California Supreme Court case, Venegas v.  County ofL os Angeles, 32 Cal 4th 820 (2004), and \n9  reject on-point Ninth Circuit precedent directing the opposite result.  For the following reasons, the \n10  Court disagrees with Defendants. \n.... \n11  The question of a sheriffs section 1983 liability is \"governed by the analytical framework set \n=10.   \nQ  •  12  out in McMillan v. Monroe County. Alabama, 520 U.S. 781.\"  Streit v. County ofL os Angeles, 236 \nU....   E \n...  <2 \n.-\n....  ~u   13  F.2d 552,559 (9th Cir. 2001).  In McMillan, the plaintiff, a criminal defendant, sued an Alabama \n.1-0.  ~0  \n'\"  u \n14  county under section 1983 for constitutional violations undertaken by the county sheriff.  The sheriff \n.~ \n~ \n<5 \n.'.\"..  \nQJ  E  15  had allegedly intimidated the plaintiff s co-defendant into making false statements and had \n....  -\"\"  \n~ to \nz0  \nrJJ  16  suppressed exculpatory evidence.  The issue before the Supreme Court was whether, for immunity \n\" \n\"C  -5 \n..=.Q-..J    \"~-  17  purposes, the sheriff was acting on behalf of the state or the county in executing this law \n;, \n18  enforcement function.  If the sheriff was a state actor, he and the county were immune from suit; if \n19  the sheriff was a county actor, he and the county were not immune.  The court offered two principles \n20  to guide the resolution of such a question.  First, the court cautioned against employing a \n21  \"categorical, 'all or nothing' approach.\"  McMillan, 520 U.S. at 785.  Instead, courts are to determine \n22  \"whether governmental officials are final policymakers for the local government in a particular area, \n23  or on a particular issue.\" Id.  Second, although the question of municipal liability under section 1983 \n24  is one of federal law, a court's \"understanding of the actual function of a governmental official, in a \n25  particular area, will necessarily be dependent on the definition of the official's functions under \n26  relevant state law.\" Id. at 786 (citation omitted).  After examining Alabama's constitutional \n27  provisions concerning sheriffs, the historical development ofthose provisions, the state supreme \n28  court's interpretation of those provisions, and relevant portions of the state code, the Supreme Court \n4 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 5 of 22\n1  found that the county sheriff, when perfonning the law enforcement functions at issue, was a State \n2  officer and was immunized by the Eleventh Amendment from suit.  The Court expressly held, \n3  however, that it was not making a categorical \"characterization of Alabama sheriffs that will hold \n4  true for every type of official action they engage in\" and limited its inquiry and its finding to those \n5  situations in which the sheriff \"acts in a law enforcement capacity.\"!  [d. at 785-86. \n6  Two Ninth Circuit cases, both of which employ the McMillan analysis, are directly on point \n7  here.  In Cortez v.  County ofL  os Angeles, 294 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 2002), at issue was whether the \n8  county sheriff acted as a county policymaker or a state policymaker when he established and \n9  implemented policies and procedures for the safekeeping of inmates in the county jail.  Similarly, in \n- 10  Streit v.  County ofL os Angeles, 236 F.3d 552, the issue before the Ninth Circuit was whether the Los \n11  Angeles County sheriff acted on behalf of the County or the State of California when he adopted and \n=1-0   \n-\nQ \nU  .E~   12  administered a county j ail policy which required a records check on prisoners before their release. \n...  <2 \n-\nOJ  u~   13  Streit and Cortez are controlling precedent on this Court.  Defendants urge the Court to ignore Ninth \n.1.-.0   ~0  \n'\"  u \n-.~   14  Circuit case law that speaks directly to the issue of whether a sheriff is a county actor or a state actor \n~ \nis \n-'C\"Il   E  15  when administering county jails, and to, instead, rely nearly exclusively on California state court case \n.\"s  \neo:: \n\" \nz0  \nr-:FJ  16  law.  As the Ninth Circuit held in Streit, \"[a]lthough we must consider the state's legal \n.\"s  \n\"0 \n.C..Il   5 \n= \"- 17  characterization of the government entities which are parties to these actions, federal law provides \n;J \n18  the rule of decision in section 1983 actions.\"  [d. at 560 (citation omitted).  \"[W]hile we must \n19  conduct an independent examination of California's Constitution, codes, and caselaw with respect to \n20  each 'particular area' or each 'particular issue,' our circuit caselaw 'provides the starting point for \n21  own analysis.'\"  Cortez, 294 F.3d at 1190 (citation omitted).  The Court declines to assign greater \n22  weight to California state court decisions than to on-point decisions out ofthe Ninth Circuit.' \n23  To detennine whether Sheriff Doyle is immune from 1983 liability here, the Court first \n24 \n25  The McMillan Court also rej ected a \"unifonn, national characterization of all sheriffs\" as \"such \n1 \na blunderbuss approach would ignore a crucial axiom of our government: the States have wide authority \n26  to set up their state and local governments as they wish.\"  520 U.S. at 795. \n27  Moreover, as discussed below, Venegas and other state court cases relied on by Defendants, \n2 \nsuch as County ofL os Angeles v. Superior Court ofL os Angeles (Peters), 68 Cal. App. 4th 1166 (1998), \n28  are factually distinguishable from the case at bar and therefore would not control the Court's decision \nin any event. \n5 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 6 of 22\nI  examines the nature of his conduct, then looks at state law to detennine whether that type of conduct \n2  was executed on behalf of the County of Marin, or the State of California. \n3  1.  The Enactment and Implementation ofIntake and Confinement Policies \nat the County Jail Are Administrative Functions Concerning County Jail \n4  Management, Not Law Enforcement Functions. \n5  In Cortez and Streit, the Ninth Circuit found that the conduct at issue looked more like \n6  administrative oversight and management of the county jail than like law enforcement.  In Cortez, \n7  the county sheriff enacted and implemented policies regarding the safekeeping ofj ail inmates. \n8  Specifically, in accordance with the sheriffs policies, an inmate was placed the gang section of the \n9  county jail where he was subsequently beaten to death.  The court first examined state statutes \n10  providing sheriffs with broad statutory authority to manage county jails.  294 F.3d at 1190 (citing \n.. \n..... \n11  CAL. GOV'T CODE § 26605 (\"sheriff shall take charge of and be the sole and exclusive authority to \n= \nc \nU  \"§  12  keep the county jail and the prisoners in it\"); CAL. PEN. CODE § 400 (providing that the county \n.......   <2 \nu  u~   13  sheriff operates the county jail)).  The court held that as administrator of the county jail, a sheriff is \n....~..  \n~0  \n'\"  u \n.~  E  14  \"responsible for developing and implementing policies pertaining to inmate housing\" and is the final \n~ is \n'\" \n..Q..).   E  15  policymaker on such issues.  294 F.3d at 1190 (citation omitted).  The court then found that policies \n\" \n..~...  \"\"'  \nrr;.  z0   16  regarding the housing of jail inmates were made by sheriffs \"not as law enforcement officials, but as \n\" \n\"Cl  -5 \n..Q..).   \"~\"   17  administrators wielding control over persons entrusted to their custody.\"  294 F.3d at 1191 (citation \n= \n.~ \n0 \n18  omitted).  In Streit, the policy at issue, less similar to the one in the case at bar, concerned \n19  administrative searches for outstanding warrants, wants, or holds on inmates to be conducted before \n20  pennitting inmates' release.  The Ninth Circuit found that this conduct, although quite similar to \n21  conduct found to constitute law enforcement function in County ofL os Angeles v. Superior Court of \n22  Los Angeles (Peters), 68 Cal. App. 4th 1166 (1998), see discussion infra, constituted an \n23  administrative function ofj ail operation. \n24  The policies alleged to have violated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights in the case at bar relate \n25  to the intake procedures and housing of county jail inmates - jail administration, not law \n26  enforcement.  If the conduct at issue in Streit is a function of jail administration, certainly strip \n27  searching detainees and housing them nude are.  Such policies are enacted and implemented not to \n28  prevent crime, but to ensure safety and security within jail walls.  The Court finds that these are \n6 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 7 of 22\n1  policies enacted and implemented in furtherance of the oversight and administration of the county \n2  jail, not to enforce the law. \n3 \n2.  According to California Law, a County Sheriff is a County Policymaker \n4  When Engaged in Jail Administration \n5  Having found that the conduct at issue concerned jail administration rather than law \n6  enforcement, the Court must now engage, as the Ninth Circuit in both Streit and Cortez did, in a \n7  McMillan-type analysis to determine whether such duties are executed on the county's behalf or the \n8  state's behalf.  In those cases, the court reviewed relevant portions ofthe California Constitution, the \n9  California Code, and relevant case law, and concluded that when acting as the administrator of the \n10  county jail, a county sheriff in California is a policymaker for the county, not the state, and is \n... \n11  therefore not immune from section 1983 liability under the Eleventh Amendment.3 \n=;...   \nU.Q..    E•   12  a.  California Constitution \n.-\n...  <8 \n..;.-....   u~   13  In contrast to the Alabama Constitution, the Streit court found, California's Constitution does \n~0  \n'\"  u \nE  14  not list county sheriffs as part of the state executive department (deemed by the McMillan court as \n~ 5 \n... \n'\" \na.  E  15  \"especially important\" for determining liability).  236 F.3d at 561.  Indeed, Article XI, section l(b) of \n...  \" \n-\" \n~ t: \nz0  \nrJ:J  16  the California Constitution designates sheriffs as county officers.  Even more critically, the Ninth \n.\"..-0.   -\"5  \na.  1; \n= \"- 17  Circuit held, the California Constitution nowhere states that a county sheriffs department acts for \n;::l \n18  the State when managing its local jails. !d.  '\" [N]ot only does the California Constitution lack the \n19  provisions most important to the Supreme Court's decision in McMillan, its provisions read much \n20  like those of the Alabama Constitution prior to that State's determined effort to clarify that sheriffs \n21  were acting for the State when exercising their law enforcement functions.'\"  Id. (quoting Roe v. \n22  County a/Lake, 107 F. Supp. 2d 1146,1149 (N.D. Cal. 2000)).  Therefore, as the Ninth Circuit \n23  found in Streit, a county sheriff s department is generally a county agency under the state \n24  Constitution.  236 F.3d at 561. \n25  III \n26 \nIt is worth noting that the Ninth Circuit does not necessarily rely on the distinction between the \nl \n27  sheriff s function as j ail administrator and the sheriff s duties regarding law enforcement to determine \nwhether or not the sheriff is a county or a state actor. Indeed, the Circuit has found that some of a county \n28  sheriffs law enforcement activities are made on behalf ofthe county, not the state.  See. e.g. Brewster \nv. Shasta County, 275 F.3d 803 (9th Cir. 2001). \n7 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 8 of 22\n1  b.  California Statutes and Regulations \n2  Defendants point to sections of the California Code that suggest sheriffs are state actors when \n3  engaged in their law enforcement duties, but ignore those portions ofthe Code that speak to jail \n4  policy and administration.  While California Government Code section 12560 grants the California \n5  Attorney General statutory control over sheriffs acting in their law enforcement capacity, California \n6  Government Code section 25303 grants counties the ultimate power over county jails.  Other statutes \n7  cited by Defendants, such as Government Code sections 26605 and 26610 and Penal Code sections \n8  4000 and 4015, confer upon the sheriff responsibility for jail administration, but do not establish the \n9  sheriff as an actor on behalf of the state when he takes on that statutorily prescribed role.  Moreover, \n10  as the Ninth Circuit noted in Streit, section 23013 grants counties the power to transfer control of \n.. \n..... \n11  jails from the sheriffto a county corrections department, which \"suggest[s] that counties actually \n= \nQ  •  12  control and operate the jails, and not the state via sheriffs.\"  236 F.3d at 561.  The Court therefore \nU  .E.  \n.......  \n.- ~ \nOJ  u  13  finds, as the Ninth Circuit in Streit found, that these Code sections \"weigh heavily in favor of [the] \n..... \n.- ~0  \n'\"  u \n14  conclusion that the [county's] jail ... policies are a county function and a county concern,\" \"the \nE \n~ is \n'\" \n..<.I.J.   E  15  [c]ounty, not the state, oversees the local jails, and the [county sheriffs department], as the \n\" \n..~...  -to\"  \nz0  \n00  16  administrator of those jails, acts for the [c]ounty.\" [d. at 562. \n\" \n\"C  -5 \n...<-.I.J.   '\"0\"    17  Defendants additionally contend that Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations (\"CCR\"), \n= \n~  18  pertaining to Crime Prevention and Corrections, demonstrates that a sheriff acts on behalf of the \n19  State when overseeing a county jail.  The Court finds, however, that the CCR sections cited by \n20  Defendants do not dictate that result.  Specifically, Defendants contend that section 1005 of Title 15 \n21  of the CCR permits a county jail to adopt its own standards for employees and facilities.  While that \n22  code section, in conjunction with Penal Code section 6030 et seq., explains that county jail standards \n23  must meet or exceed, and may not conflict with, the standards imposed by the State of California \n24  Board of Corrections and that the State's Board of Corrections reviews the standards established for \n25  the county jails, this does not render county jail supervision a state action.  As Plaintiffs point out in \n26  their supplemental brief, California's codes and regulations are replete with directives to local \n27  governmental agencies and their employees but those statutes and regulations do not cloak the local \n28  governmental entities with Eleventh Amendment immunity.  See, e.g., Beentjes v. Placer County Air \n8 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 9 of 22\nI  Pollution Control Dist., 254 F. Supp. 2d 1159, 1171 (E.D. Cal. 2003) (local air pollution control \n2  districts, which derive their authority from the State and are granted wide latitude to conduct their \n3  affairs as they see fit so long as they maintain standards at least as stringent as those adopted by the \n4  State, are not local agencies and are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.)  Moreover, the \n5  Ninth Circuit in Cortez acknowledged those provisions of Title 15 that assign broad authority to \n6  sheriffs for county jail management, but still held that when a sheriff acts as administrator of the \n7  county jail, he acts on behalf of the county, not the state.  294 F.3d at 1190.  Defendants' argument \n8  that Title 15 of the CCR dictates that a sheriff acts on behalf of the State of California when \n9  administering a county j ail fails. \n10  c.  California Case Law \n.... \n... \n11  As noted supra, Defendants urge the Court to rely on and extend the California Supreme \n= \nQ  • \n12  Court's holding in Venegas, 32 Cal. 4th 820.  Notwithstanding the Court's conclusion that it is not \nU....   E \n......   <E \n.......   u~   13  bound by a California state court decision when determining issues of section 1983 liability, see \n...  ~0  \n'\"  u \n.jj  14  discussion supra, the Court finds that even if Venegas were binding precedent, it would not compel a \n~ \ni5 \n.'.Q\"...l    E  15  different result. \n....  \" \n~ ~ \nz \nIJJ  16  In that case, the plaintiffs sued, inter alia, the county and its sheriff s department, under \n.\"s  \n't:l \n..Q......l    5 \n= \"- 17  section 1983, for violations of their constitutional rights during the sheriffs department's \n~  18  investigation of criminal activity.  As part of a task force operated by the sheriff, a police officer \n19  stopped the plaintiffs (husband and wife) while investigating the husband's brother for car theft.  The \n20  husband was arrested and detained but no charges were filed.  There, unlike in the case at bar, the \n21  sheriff and his task force were engaged in a criminal investigation.  The Venegas court repeatedly \n22  characterized the sheriffs department's actions as law enforcement activities or functions.  See, e.g., \n23  32 Cal. 4th at 826,828,829,834,838,839,852.  The conditions of jail detention were not at issue; \n24  intake procedures were not raised.  The question at bar, here, is on which entity's behalf a sheriff acts \n25  when engaging in county jail administration duties.  Venegas simply does not speak to that question. \n26  Defendants contend that Venegas is instructive here because of its approval of a more on-\n27  point California appellate court decision in Peters, 68 Cal. App. 4th 1166.  In Peters, a sheriff was \n28  accused of violating the plaintiffs' constitutional rights by detaining them beyond their release date \n9 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 10 of 22\nI  in order to comply with an outstanding warrant.  The Peters case is equally unavailing for \n2  Defendants.  First, again, California state case law on this issue is not binding on this Court, as \n3  discussed supra.  Moreover, however, Peters, like Venegas, is distinguishable on its facts from the \n4  case at bar.  The court in Peters expressly held that determining whether to release someone subject \n5  to arrest on an outstanding warrant was \"a law enforcement function\" that could not be \n6  \"characterize[dJ ... as merely operational or administrative.\"  68 Cal. App. 4th at 1177; see also \n7  Streit, 236 F.3d 552 (concluding that the Peters sheriffs conduct - complying with a warrant-\n8  constituted law enforcement, and was distinguishable from the administrative jail policy of checking \n9  to see if any warrants existed).  Defendants additionally cite to the California Supreme Court's \n10  holding in Pitts v. County ofK  ern, 17 Cal. 4th 340 (1998).  Again, reliance on this state court case is \n.. \n.... \nII  misplaced.  First, even if Pitts were on point, it would not be binding on the Court.  Second, the issue \n= \nU..Q..    .E~   12  in Pitts concerned whether district attorneys were state actors or county actors when bringing and \n..  <8 \n.-\nu  ~  13  dismissing criminal charges.  The court found that district attorneys acted on the state's behalf in \n....  U \n.- ~0  \n'\"  u \n14  preparing and prosecuting crimes.  This case is wholly uninstructive on whether a sheriff, engaged in \nj; \n~ cS \n.'Q.\"...l    ~  15  j ail oversight and management as opposed to law enforcement, acts on behalf of the county or the \n....  \"\" \n~ 15 \n00.  z  16  state. \n-e  ..\"5  \n.... \n.Q-.l  6 \n\"\"  17  There is a clearly-established distinction between overseeing and managing a county jail on \n= \n;;;;; \n18  the one hand, and engaging in law enforcement functions on the other, for purposes of assessing a \n19  sheriffs immunity from section 1983 liability.  Having examined the California Constitution and \n20  relevant state statutes and regulations, and in accordance with the Ninth Circuit's holdings in Streit \n21  and Cortez, the Court finds that a county sheriff, purely engaged in j ail oversight and administration, \n22  acts on behalf of the county, not the State.  The California state court cases cited by Defendants do \n23  nothing to alter the Court's conclusion.  Because the Court finds that strip searching detainees and \n24  confining them, naked, in cells, are intake and housing policies and procedures that fall into the \n25  category of jail oversight and administration, the Court concludes that Sheriff Robert T. Doyle was \n26  acting on behalf of the County of Marin in enacting and implementing those alleged policies.  As \n27  such, the Court finds that Sheriff Doyle is not immune, pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, from \n28  section 1983 liability.  Defendants' motion to dismiss on this ground is therefore DENIED. \n10 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 11 of 22\n1  B.  The County of Marin Is Thereby Also Not Immune \n2  Under Monell v. New York City Dep 't ofS oc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978), a county is subject \n3  to section 1983 liability for unconstitutional actions taken by the county's sheriffifthe county's \n4  \"policies, whether set by the government's lawmakers 'or by those whose edicts or acts that may \n5  fairly be said to represent official policy' caused the particular constitutional violation at issue.\" \n6  Streit, 236 F.3d 552, 559 (citing Monell, 436 U.S. at 694).  If the sheriff is a policymaker for the \n7  state, no liability lies against the county under Monell.  However, where, as here, the sheriff was \n8  acting on behalf of the County in instituting the policies that are the subject of the constitutional \n9  violation in question, the County is subject to section 1983 liability.  Having concluded that Sheriff \n10  Doyle was acting in his capacity as a policymaker for the County in implementing the jail policies \n.... \n11  and procedures at issue, and that as such, Sheriff Doyle is not immune from section 1983 liability, \nl=o.   \nQ  \"  12  the Court finds that Defendant County of Marin is also not immune.

U \nlo.  ~0  \n.'~\"   .u~   14  II,  Statute of Limitations \n~ \nis \n.'.\"..  \nQ,j  E  15  Defendants contend that the statute oflimitations has run as to any claims that accrued before \n.0..:1.   '\"i!  \n0 \n[/J  Z  16  January 1,2003.  California's statute oflimitations for personal injury claims governs both the state \n..\"s  \n'.C...  \nQ,j  '\"0\"    17  law and federal causes of action in this case.  See, e.g., Johnson v. State of California, 207 F.3d 650, \n= \n.~ \n~  18  653 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"Because § 1983 does not contain a statute oflimitations, federal courts apply \n19  the forum state's statute of limitations for personal injury claims\").  This means that Defendants' \n20  statute oflimitations argument pertains to all of Plaintiffs' claims. \n21  On January I, 2003, California Government Code section 335.1 was enacted, extending the \n22  limitations period on personal injury actions (and correspondingly, to federal civil rights claims, see \n23  Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261,271-72 (1985)) from one year, under former section 340(3), to two \n24  years.  Defendants contend that the amendment to the operative statute oflimitations does not work \n25 \n26 \nDefendants argue next that Plaintiffs' pendant state law claims against Defendant County of \n4 \n27  Marin should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  This argument is expressly conditioned on the \nCourt's dismissal ofP  laintiffs ' federal claims. (Motion at 12-13.) As the Court has denied Defendants' \n28  motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' federal claims, the Court views Defendants' jurisdictional argument as \nmoot and declines to reach it. \n11 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 12 of 22\n1  to extend the limitations period for claims accrued before the date of amendment.'  In other words, \n2  for any alleged conduct that accrued before January I, 2003, Defendants suggest that no claim may \n3  be filed more than one year afterwards.  Defendants contend that because the Complaint in this \n4  action was not filed until July 12, 2004, any claims based on pre-January I, 2003 conduct are time-\n5  barred.  The Court disagrees. \n6  It is settled that the section 335.1 amendment does not apply retroactively to revive expired \n7  claims.  See, e.g. Krupnickv. Duke Energy MORRO Bay, 115 Cal. App. 4th 1026, 1029 (2004).  It is \n8  also settled that generally, \"an amendment which enlarges a period of limitation applies to pending \n9  matters where not otherwise expressly excepted.\" Mudd v. McColgan, 30 Cal. 2d 463, 468 (1947). \n10  However, in the context of section 335.1, there is a divergence of opinion among federal district \n..... \n11  courts in California as to whether the extended limitations period is applicable to claims accrued, but \n=\"'\"   \nU0   E\"   12  not expired, before January I, 2003, when the amendment took effect.  Compare Abreu v. Ramirez, \n.......   <8 \nOJ  u~   13  284 F. Supp. 2d 1250 (C.D. Cal. 2003), with Kiss v. City o/Santa Clara, 2004 U.S. Dist.

In Jordan, a federal district court found that section 335.1, in accordance with \n\" \n..e..'.l   ~ \nz0  \nrJJ  16  the rule set forth in Mudd, applies retrospectively to pending claims.  2003 U.S. Dist.

In contrast, the district court in Abreu \n0 \n18  held that \"unless otherwise specified, the statute oflimitations in effect at the time a claim accrues is \n19  the limitation applicable to that claim for all time.\"  284 F. Supp. 2d at 1256.  The court there found \n20  that \"[n]othing in the legislation extending California's personal-injury limitations period suggests \n21  that the California Legislature intended section 335.1 to apply retroactively, except to claims made \n22  by victims of terrorist actions on September II, 2001.\" Abreu, 284 F. Supp. 2d at 1256 (citing S.B. \n23  688, Ch. 448, Stats. of2002, §§ (c) & (d)).  The court explained that it was most persuaded by the \n24  legislature's express carve-out language for September II, 2001 victims.  Ifthe legislature had \n25  otherwise intended section 335.1 to apply to pending claims, the court reasoned, the carve out would \n26  not have been necessary.  [d. at 1256. \n27 \nFederal law controls the question of when a claim accrues. Johnson, 207 F.3d at 653 (citation \n5 \n28  omitted).  Under federal law, a claim accrues when a plaintiff knows, or should know, of the factual \npredicate underlying the potential cause of action.  [d. (citation omitted). \n12 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 13 of 22\n1  The Court respectfully disagrees with the result in Abreu.  The California Legislature need \n2  not have affirmatively stated that the extended limitations period was to apply to pending claims \n3  because, according to Mudd and its progeny, the rule is that it would so apply unless otherwise \n4  specified.  Defendants contend that Section 335.I's express application to claims arising out of the \n5  September II, 2001 terrorist attacks constitutes such an express exception to the rule in favor of \n6  retrospective application under Mudd.  In essence, expressio un ius est exclusio alterius.  But \n7  Defendants have it wrong.  The carve-out language in section 335.1 directed toward September 11, \n8  200 I victims creates an exception, not to some non-existent rule against its application to pending \n9  claims, but to the well-established rule against reviving expired claims.  As of January I, 2003, when \n10  the new limitations statute was enacted, claims arising out of the September 11, 2001 attacks were \n.... \n11  long-expired under the old one-year statute of limitations.  The legislature expressly carved out an \n='\"'   \nU.Q...    \"E   12  exception to the anti-revival rule so that terrorism victims might have a remedy for their injuries. \n...  <8 \n.<..o.J   u~   13  The carve-out exception does not, however, speak to pending claims.  Therefore, in accordance with \n.'.\".'   ~0  \n'\"  u \n.~   14  Jordan, Kiss, and Mudd, the Court finds that for any unexpired personal injury claims that accrued \n~ \nis \n.'.\"..  \nQ)  E  15  before January 1, 2003, the applicable statute oflimitations is the newly enacted California \n....  -\"\"  \n~ to \nrrJ  ;e0o   16  Government Code section 335.1 - a two-year limitations statute - because those claims were \n\" \n\"'C  -5 \n.... \n..Q.)   \"\"0'    17  pending when the new limitations statute was enacted. \n== \n~  18  Here, Plaintiffs filed their class action on July 12, 2004.  This means that any claims that \n19  accrued on or after July 12, 2002 are properly before the Court.  Defendants' motion to dismiss all \n20  claims that accrued before January 1, 2003 as time-barred is therefore DENIED. \n21  The Court must address, however, the claims raised by Plaintiffs' Complaint that accrued \n22  before July 12, 2002.  In paragraph 12 of the Complaint, Plaintiffs raise claims on behalf of unnamed \n23  plaintiffs who, at any time after June 23, 2000, were subjected to the same jail treatment that \n24  Plaintiffs Chatoian and Tasca allege.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure I2(e), Defendants \n25  move for a more definite statement regarding this portion of Plaintiffs' complaint.  In their \n26  Opposition to the instant motion, Plaintiffs appear to have offered a clarification and now contend \n27  that for the state law claims only, Plaintiffs raise claims on behalf of unnamed plaintiffs that accrued \n28 \n13 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 14 of 22\n1  no later than July 23,2003, six months prior to the filing oftheir class claim.6  (Opposition at 24-25.) \n2  The Court assumes that this clarification is made in light of the California Tort Claims Act \n3  (\"CTCA\") requirement, specifically California Government Code section 911.2, that a claim against \n4  a public entity must be presented in writing to the entity no later than six months after the accrual of \n5  the claim.'  Because the class claim was presented to the appropriate government entity\" on January \n6  23,2004, only claims that accrued on or after July 23,2003 are at issue.  The Court accepts \n7  Plaintiffs' more definitive statement and finds that in light of that clarification, no claims raised by \n8  Plaintiffs are time-barred. \n9  III.  State Law Claims \n10  Plaintiffs bring three state law claims against Defendants.  Plaintiffs' third and fourth causes \n.... \n11  of action allege that Defendants violated California Civil Code sections 52 and 52.1 and California \n='\"'   \nU..Q..    .E~   12  Penal Code section 4030, respectively, for subjecting Plaintiffs to strip searches.

Plaintiff Tasca's State Law Claims Are Dismissed \n-=  ..\"s  \n...-..  a \n~ '\"  17  Defendants contend that Plaintiff Cynthia Tasca's Government Tort Claim (attached to the \n= \n~  18  Complaint as Exhibit B) does not comply with the CTCA requirements.  Plaintiff Tasca concedes \n19  that her claim was insufficiently specific.  The Court, therefore, GRANTS Defendants' motion on \n20  this ground and dismisses Plaintiff Tasca's state law claims (the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Counts of \n21  the Complaint). \n22 \n23  Plaintiffs clarify that as to the federal claims, they raise claims on behalf of nnnamed plaintiffs \n6 \nwho were subjected to strip search and nude cell placement on or before July 12, 2002.  This is \n24  appropriate as the California Tort Claims Act (\"CTCA\") requirement that a claim be presented to the \ngovernmental entity before filing a lawsuit applies only to state law claims and not to actions brought \n25  nnder section 1983.  Williams v. Horvath, 16 Cal. 3d 834, 842 (1976). \n26  The CTCA further requires ajudicial claim to be filed no more than six months after the claim \n7 \nis presented to the government entity.  Plaintiffs complied with this requirement. \n27 \nWith the exception of Plaintiff Tasca's state law claims, compliance with the California Tort \nS \n28  Claims Act is not disputed here. The Court therefore assumes that Plaintiffs filed their class claim with \nthe appropriate governmental entity. \n14 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 15 of 22\n1  B.  Immunity Under the California Tort Claims Act \n2  Defendants move for dismissal of Plaintiffs' state law claims on the grounds that the County \n3  of Marin and Sheriff Doyle are entitled to immunity under various provisions of the CTCA \n4  (California Government Code sections 810, et seq.).  Defendants argue, inter alia, that Sheriff Doyle \n5  is entitled to discretionary immunity pursuant to section 820.2, that in the alternative, he is entitled to \n6  immunity under section 820.8, and that the County of Marin is immune under sections 815.2 and \n7  844.6.  Preliminarily, the Court notes that these governmental tort liability provisions do not apply to \n8  claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Rodriguez v. Cal. Highway Patrol, 89 F. Supp. 2d 1131, \n9  1138 (N.D. Cal. 2000) (citing CAL. GOy'T CODE § 814).  The CTCA's immunity provisions apply \n10  only to claims for damages.  [d.  Here, Plaintiffs have prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief, \n.... \nII  and for money damages.  (Complaint at l3-14.)  Thus, the Court's consideration of Defendants' \n:.... \n= \nC  •  12  immunity arguments apply only to Plaintiffs' state law claims for damages.  All of Plaintiffs' state \nU....

There is no doubt that the alleged policy \n20  enacted and implemented by Sheriff Doyle regarding intake and housing procedures for \n21  prearraigrunentjail detainees constitntes a discretionary act within the meaning of section 820.2. \n22  See, e.g., Johnson v. State o/California, 69 Cal. 2d 782,793 (1968) (discretionary actions are those \n23  involving basic policy decisions).9  Plaintiffs do not suggest otherwise.  Instead, Plaintiffs posit the \n24  theory that section 820.2 does not apply to, or is abrogated by, the statutes under which Plaintiffs \n25  bring their state law claims.  Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that to find that the CTCA immunizes \n26  Sheriff Doyle and the County of Marin would effectively emasculate sections 4030, 52, and 52.1. \n27 \nWere Plaintiffs seeking to hold Sheriff Doyle liable for personally carrying out the strip search \n9 \n28  and naked cell placement policies, however, those ministerial acts might not be considered discretionary \nunder 820.2.  See, e.g. Johnson, 69 Cal. 2d at 793. \n15 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 16 of 22\n1  The California Supreme Court has held that the discretionary immunity set forth in section \n2  820.2 \"cannot be abrogated by a statute which simply imposes a general duty or liability on persons \n3  including public employees.\"  Caldwell v. Montoya, lOCal. 4th 972, 986 (1995).  Where immunity \n4  exists, it is only withdrawn \"by a clear indication of legislative intent that statutory immunity is \n5  withheld or withdrawn in the particular case.\" [d. (italics omitted). \n6  In Caldwell, the court held that under section 820.2, a school board was immune from \n7  California's Fair Housing and Employment Act (\"FEHA\") liability for its refusal to renew a \n8  superintendent's contract.  The court reasoned that the board's decision was discretionary and that \n9  FEHA, which created a general statutory duty and liability for violation of its provisions, did not \n10  abrogate section 820.2 immunity because it did not expressly withdraw immunity. \n.. \n.... \nII  The question here, as in Caldwell, is whether the statutes pursuant to which Plaintiffs bring \n= \nQ  \"  12  their state law claims contain an express legislative intent to withdraw otherwise applicable \nU....

CAL. PEN. CODE § 4030(a).  The statute is aimed expressly at \"protect[ing] the state and \n19  federal constitutional rights of the people of California by establishing a statewide policy strictly \n20  limiting strip and body cavity searches.\" People v.  Wade, 208 Cal. App. 3d 304, 308 (1989) (citing \n21  CAL. PEN. CODE, § 4030(a)).  Subsection (b) declares that the statute applies to prearraignment \n22  detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses.  According to the statute, it is a \n23  misdemeanor to \"knowingly and willfully authorize[] or conduct[] a body cavity search in violation \n24  of this section.\"  PEN. CODE § 4030(n).  Subsection (p) affords a person so searched statutory civil \n25  remedies including recovery of actual damages. \n26  Defendants argue that the language of section 4030 does not reflect a clear indication of \n27  legislative intent to withdraw or withhold immunity as to county sheriffs or any individual actors \n28  accused of enacting unlawful strip searching policies or conducting such searches, as is required \n16 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 17 of 22\n1  under Caldwell.  Defendants acknowledge that the statute imposes a legal duty to abstain from \n2  engaging in or authorizing such searches and it provides civil remedies when its provisions are \n3  violated.  But, Defendants argue that as the court found in Caldwell as to FEHA, Penal Code section \n4  4030 \"contains no indicia of an additional intent that individual public officials or employees may be \n5  sued despite a specific statutory immunity that would otherwise apply in a particular case.\"  lOCal. \n64th at 986. \n7  Plaintiffs urge the Court to find that section 820.2 is overridden by Penal Code section 4030 \n8  because, Plaintiffs contend, section 4030 is a narrowly-drawn statute aimed at law enforcement \n9  officials who conduct unlawful strip searches and at law enforcement officials who enact and \n- 10  implement policies for conducting such strip searches.  To find that Sheriff Doyle, who is alleged to \n-\n11  have enacted, overseen, and implemented the policies and procedures at issue in this lawsuit, \n= \n-Q  •  12  immune from section 4030 liability, Plaintiffs argue, would render section 4030 a nullity.  The Court \nU  § \n.--..  ..s \nOJ  u~   13  agrees. \n...  ~0  \n'\"  u \ns  14  Plaintiffs argue that this case is more like Shoemaker v. Myers, 2 Cal. App. 4th 1407 (1992), \n~- 6 \n-'Q\"I   \"  15  than like Caldwell.  In Shoemaker, a California appellate court found Government Code section \n\" \n~ ~ \nr-J1  z0   16  19683, a whistle-blowing statute, to abrogate CTCA governmental tort immunity.  Section 19683 \n\" \n'C  ii \n... \nQI  'i\"s   17  \"subjected 'any' state 'officer or employee' to direct civil liability for using official power against \n= \n;J \n18  the efforts of another state officer or employee to report job-related violations oflaw to appropriate \n19  agencies.\" [d. at 1424-25.  The appellate court found that because section 19683 was primarily, if \n20  not exclusively, aimed at public actors and because it created direct civil liability for any violation of \n21  the law, to find that the CTCA provision at issue immunized public employees from liability from \n22  the whistle-blowing statute \"would largely emasculate the latter section and thereby frustrate the \n23  legislative purpose behind its enactment.\" [d. at 1425.  The court went on to hold that to grant \n24  CTCA immunity to a party violating section 19683 is \"totally inconsistent with the design of section \n25  19683.\" !d. \n26  In Caldwell, on the other hand, the California Supreme Court considered the analysis in \n27  Shoemaker and determined that the statute at issue, FEHA, unlike section 19638, did not abrogate \n28  CTCA immunity.  10 Cal. 4th 972.  The court held that while section 19638's \"specific nature and \n17 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 18 of 22\n1  purpose ... providers] a 'clear indication of ... intent' [such that] the personal immunities of public \n2  employees are abrogated,\" by contrast, \"FEHA promotes much more general policies throughout the \n3  public and private sectors and advances no specifically governmental interest that would support a \n4  finding of intent to abrogate any immunity of public employees.\" Id. at 986 n.7 (emphasis in \n5  original). \n6  The statute at issue in this case is analogous to the one at issue in Shoemaker.  There is no \n7  doubt that like section 19638, section 4030 is \"directed chiefly, if not exclusively, against state \n8  employees otherwise protected by [CTCA] immunity,\" rather than at private actors.  Shoemaker, 2 \n9  Cal. App. 4th at 1425.  The very text of section 4030 expresses the legislature'S intent that the statute \n- 10  apply to law enforcement policies and procedures with respect to prearraigmnent detainees.  CAL. \n.. \n11  PEN. CODE § 4030(a).  Whereas the statute at issue in Caldwell, FEHA, is directed at both public and \n= \n-c  •  12  private discrimination, section 4030 is not aimed at the conduct of private citizens and can only be \nU  E \n..-.  '\" \n-\n.O-J  u~   l3  understood as an effort by the legislature to streamline the strip-searching policies employed by \n~0  \n'\"  u  14  public law enforcement officials.  See CAL. PEN. CODE § 4030(a)-(b).  Under no interpretation could \n.~ \n~- \" \n-.'C\",l>    E  15  this statute apply to anyone but a goverrunent employee.  Moreover, like section 19683, subsection \n\" \n' €\nr-Jj  z0   16  (p) of section 4030 creates direct civil liability for violations of the strip-searching statute. \n.\"c-::I  -\"s  \nCl>  \"1\"5   17  Therefore, the Court finds that like the statute at issue in Shoemaker, and unlike the one at issue in \n= \n;;;J \n18  Caldwell, section 4030 expresses the legislature's intent to withdraw otherwise applicable immunity \n19  under the CTCA.  To find law enforcement policymakers immune from section 4030 liability would \n20  frustrate the legislature's purpose in enacting section 4030 in the first place.  Thus, the Court finds \n21  that section 820.2 does not immunize Defendant Doyle from liability on Plaintiffs' section 4030 \n22  claim for damages.  Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' Penal Code section 4030 claim against \n23  Defendant Sheriff Doyle is DENIED. \n24  b.  Immunity From Civil Code Section 52 Liability \n25  Unlike Penal Code section 4030, Civil Code section 52 cannot be read to withdraw CTCA \n26  immunity.  Indeed, California state and federal courts have held that California Tort Claims Act \n27  immunities apply to claims brought under the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  See, e.g., Gates v. Superior \n28  Court, 32 Cal. App. 4th 481,494 (1995); Gibson v. County ofR  ivers ide, 181 F. SUpp. 2d 1057,1086 \n18 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 19 of 22\nI  (C.D. Cal. 2002).  The Court declines to find otherwise.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS \n2  Defendants' motion on this ground and dismisses Plaintiffs' section 52 claims for damages against \n3  Sheriff Robert T. Doyle.  Plaintiffs' section 52 claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against \n4  Sheriff Doyle remain in play. \n10 \n5  c.  No Immunity From Civil Code Section 52.1 Liability \n6  Civil Code section 52.1 contains a liability provision that has been interpreted as an express \n7  intention to withdraw immunity.  In Doe v. Petaluma City Sch. Dist., 830 F. Supp. 1560 (N.D. Cal. \n8  1993), the court found that governmental tort \"immunity is not available for a violation of Civil \n9  Code § 52.1 since ... section 52.1 specifically provides liability for individuals 'whether or not \n10  acting under color of law.'\"  Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' \n..... \n11  section 52.1 claims against Sheriff Doyle.  Those claims remain in play. \n1=0.   \nQ  •  12  2.  Sheriff Doyle's Immunity Under Section 820.8. \nU  E \n....-.....   '\" \n...1-.0...   ~~u0     13  California Government Code section 820.8 provides immunity to public employees for \n'\"  u \ns  14  injuries caused by the act or omission of another person.  Defendants contend that Sheriff Doyle is \n~ ;5 \n'\" \n..Q..).   E  15  immune from suit under section 820.8 because Plaintiffs have failed to allege a causal link between \n\" \n..'\".=..   ~ \nrr;.  z0   16  any act of Sheriff Doyle and the injuries allegedly sustained by PlaintiffsY  As Plaintiffs point out, \n\" \n.\"C-  -5 \n..Q..).   \"a'   17  however, Plaintiffs do not seek to hold Sheriff Doyle vicariously liable for the actions of his \n= \n;;;, \n18  subordinates (e.g. carrying out the strip searches and holding Plaintiffs in cells naked).  Instead, \n19  Plaintiffs seek to hold Sheriff liable for his own conduct - for enacting and implementing policies \n20  that violate Penal Code section 4030 and Civil Code section 52.1.  Therefore, the Court finds that \n21  Defendants' 820.8 immunity argument is without merit and DENIES this aspect of Defendants' \n22  motion. \n23 \nAt oral argument, the Court asked Defendants to provide additional briefing on whether the \n\\0 \n24  immunities set forth in the CTCA apply to public employees sued in their individual capacities as well \nas in their official capacities. Defendants report finding no authority suggesting any distinction in how \n25  the CTCA immunities are applied based on the capacity in which a public employee is sued.  The \nCourt's exhaustive search rendered the same result.  Moreover, the CTCA itself makes no  such \n26  distinction.  The Court finds, then, that Sheriff Doyle's immunity from Plaintiffs' section 52 claim \nrenders him immune from suit in both his individual and his official capacity on that claim. \n27 \nHaving already determined that Sheriff Doyle is immune from Civil Code section 52 liability \n11 \n28  pursuant to section 820.2, the Court only considers Defendants' section 820.8 immunity argument with \nrespect to Plaintiffs' Penal Code section 4030 and Civil Code section 52.1 claims. \n19 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 20 of 22\n1 \n3.  County of Marin's Immunity \n2 \na.  Pursuant To Section 815.2, the County of Marin Is Immune From \n3  Liability on Civil Code Section 52 Claims For Damages. \n4  According to California Government Code section 815.2(b), \"a public entity is not liable for \n5  an injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is \n6  immune from liability.\"  Because the Court finds that Sheriff Doyle is immune, under section 820.2, \n7  from liability on Plaintiffs' section 52 claim for damages, the Court finds that under section 815.2, \n8  Defendant County of Marin is also immune on that claim.  Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss \n9  Plaintiffs' section 52 claim for damages against County of Marin on derivative immunity grounds is \n10  GRANTED.  Plaintiffs' section 52 claim against the County of Marin for declaratory and injunctive \n... \n11  relief remains in play.  \n~=  \nU..Q.-.    §\"   12  b.

The question, then, is whether the CTCA immunizes the \n= \np \n18  County from liability for claims made pursuant to California Penal Code section 4030 and California \n19  Civil Code section 52.1.12 \n20  The Court is guided by the expressio unius est exclusio alterius canon.  Section 844.6 sets \n21  forth specific exceptions to a government entity's immunity and does not enumerate Penal Code \n22  section 4030 or Civil Code section 52.1 among those exceptions.  The legislature'S expression of \n23  certain exceptions suggests that omitting others was intentional and that a government entity is \n24  immune from liability for Plaintiffs' section 4030 and 52.1 claims.  The Court is also guided by the \n25  California Supreme Court's holding in Caldwell that where immunity exists, it is only withdrawn \n26 \n27  Whether section 844.6 immunizes the County from liability on the Civil Code section 52 \n12 \nclaims for damages was also briefed by the parties. However, because the Court has already determined \n28  that section 815.2 provides derivative immunity to the County on this claim, the Court declines to \naddress whether section 844.6's immunity applies to that claim. \n20 \n\nCase 3:04-cv-02790-MJJ     Document 27      Filed 12/14/2004     Page 21 of 22\n1  \"by a clear indication of legislative intent that statutory immunity is withheld or withdrawn in the \n2  particular case.\"  10  Cal. 4th at 986.  Nothing in Penal Code section 4030 indicates that the \n3  legislature intended to withdraw immunity as to government entities sued pursuant to that statute. \n4  As discussed supra, section 4030 is specifically directed at those law enforcement officials who \n5  create and implement violative strip search policies.  Nothing in section 52.1 indicates that statutory \n6  immunity is to be withheld or withdrawn.  Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' \n7  claims against Defendant County of Marin for violations of California Penal Code section 4030 and \n8  Civil Code section 52.1 for damages is hereby GRANTED.  Plaintiffs section 4030 and section 52.1 \n9  claims against the County of Marin for declaratory and injunctive relief remain in play. \n10  CONCLUSION \n.... \n11  For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \n=\"\"  \nQ  \"  12  Defendants' motion to dismiss as follows: \nU....   .§.  \n...  :@ \n...\"~.\".   u  Defendants' motion to dismiss Sheriff Doyle from the entire action on the ground that he is a \n~0   policy maker for the State, not the County, and as such, is immune from section 1983 liability \n'\"  u \n.~  E  under the Eleventh Amendment is DENIED. \n~ 5 \n.'.\"..  \nE \n.~...  .\"s   Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' federal claims against Defendant County of Marin \n~ 6 \nz \n1Z1  on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds is DENIED. \n.\"s  \n\"..C..  \n~ 6 \n.=~  '\"  Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' pendant state law claims against Defendant County \np  of Marin on jurisdictional grounds is moot as it was conditioned upon the dismissal of the \nfederal claims which the Court has not done. \nDefendants' motion to dismiss all claims by class members that accrued before January 1, \n2003 as barred by the statute oflimitations is DENIED. \nDefendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff Tasca's state law claims for failure to comply with \nthe California Tort Claims Act is GRANTED.
