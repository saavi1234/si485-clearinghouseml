    "summary": "<p>The case arose from the August 15, 2000 misdemeanor arrests of 71 bicyclists engaged in a protest at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. The cyclists were charged with reckless driving and were turned over to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for processing at the Los Angeles Inmate Reception Center. Prior to their detention, the male arrestees were subjected to pat-down searches and removal of personal property, while the females were subjected to pre-arraignment strip searches and visual body cavity examinations by female officers. The female arrestees were also subjected to a second strip search the following day, after a court had already ordered that they be released from custody. Both the men and women claimed that they were held at least twelve hours after all charges against them had been dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>On April 27, 2001, six plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of a class consisting of the 71 bicycle protestors who were subjected to the \"mass arrest\" of August 15, 2000. The female plaintiffs alleged that they were illegally strip-searched and both the male and female plaintiffs complained that they were improperly arrested, improperly detained after the court ordered their release, and subjected to inadequate conditions of confinement.</p>\r\n<p>At the time of this incident, it was the practice of guards at some LA facilities to conduct strip searches and visual body cavity inspections of all arrestees before introducing them into the general jail population. That policy had been challenged more generally in <a href=\"../../../../case/9746/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Williams v. County of Los Angeles</a>. The judge in the Musso case tried to transfer it to the Williams court on grounds that it was a related case. However, because Williams had an appeal pending at the time of the attempted transfer, the Williams judge sent the Musso case back. Williams eventually settled in mid-2001 when the LASD acknowledged that the blanket strip search policy was illegal and in violation of California Penal Code Section 4030(f), which provided that misdemeanor and infraction arrestees may not be strip searched prior to arraignment unless (1) they are charged with an offense involving weapons, drugs, or violence or (2) there is reasonable suspicion that they are concealing a weapon or contraband. Williams settled for $27 million dollars (eventually shared among 40,000 claimants), but the Musso plaintiffs were expressly excluded from that settlement.</p>\r\n<p>After two years of litigation, the Musso case was settled for $2.75 million. According to press accounts, each female plaintiff received $70,000 and each male plaintiff received $5000.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on the ongoing reform of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department during this period, see <a href=\"../../../../case/1017/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LA County Sheriff's Department (Kolts Report and Implementation)</a>, which describes those efforts. In particular, the 19th semi-annual report of Special Counsel Merrick Bobb, available there, comments on the Musso case and changes to the LASD's strip search policies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The LASD is one of the four largest\nlaw enforcement agencies in the United States, serving a population of approx-\nimately 3 million people.  The Sheriff’s Department has nearly 8,200 sworn\nofficers and a total of 14,000 employees.  The LASD makes about 100,000\narrests a year.  It currently has 25 stations throughout the County of Los\nAngeles.  Its annual budget is roughly $1.7 billion.  The LASD operates the\nlargest urban jail system in the United States, and Men’s Central Jail houses\nunder one roof more inmates than any single facility in the rest of the nation.\nIn 1992, the Board of Supervisors commissioned an investigation of the\nLASD by Special Counsel James Kolts, a highly respected former prosecutor\nand Superior Court judge.  The impetus for the investigation was public concern\nabout LASD officer-involved shootings and controversial uses of force.  The\nRodney King beating by the LAPD in March 1991 was a catalyst for a national\nre-examination of how and against whom the police use lethal and less than\nlethal force.  The rioting that followed the acquittal of Rodney King’s LAPD\nassailants in the spring of 1992, while the Kolts investigation was ongoing,\nlent additional urgency.  The rapid and seemingly unstoppable rise in the dollar\namount of judgments and settlements against the LASD for police misconduct\nreached staggering sums and was the subject of a Los Angeles Times exposé.\n1\n\nAt the conclusion of the Kolts investigation, Supervisor Ed Edelman\ncalled for Judge Kolts and Sheriff Sherman Block to hammer out an agree-\nment for implementation of the Kolts recommendations and for ongoing\nmonitoring.  At the conclusion of those negotiations, the General Counsel of\nthe Kolts investigation took over Judge Kolts’ title and position as Special\nCounsel to the Board and County.  The Kolts recommendations sought\nnothing less than a complete overthrow of the dominant ethos and culture\nof the Sheriff’s Department and its replacement by a highly professional,\nproblem-solving, and community-oriented force of men and women on the\nstreets and in the jails.  Unlike many blue-ribbon reports, the Kolts Report\nwas not about to be quickly forgotten; there would be semiannual reports\nand ongoing monitoring until the job was done.  This is the nineteenth public\nreport by members of the original Kolts staff and others who have stayed\ntogether to monitor the LASD’s ongoing cultural change.\nThis report assesses the LASD’s evolving new ethos from three different\nvantage points.  Chapter One examines the LASD’s current efforts to restrain\nand control deputy sheriffs from rushing headlong into dangerous foot\npursuits.  A litmus test in American policing is how an agency deals with\nchases by car and by foot.  A lawenforcement agency continues to live in an\nera of unenlightened policing if it does not eliminate or very tightly control\nsolo foot pursuits and car chases and the unnecessary shootings and force\nincidents which follow in their wake.  Nearly a quarter of shootings in the\nLASD between 1997 and 2002 came at the end of foot pursuits.  While not\nevery such shooting was avoidable, many were.  In many instances, the\nsuspect could have been captured in a safer and smarter way.  We advocated\nthat the LASD come up with a new foot pursuit policy.  \nIn November 2004, the LASD promulgated a revised foot pursuit policy\nthat had been nearly two years in the making.  The new policy improves upon\nprior policy substantially.  In one form or another, it addresses all the\n2\n\ntopics that a good foot pursuit policy should.  To its credit, the LASD has\ntackled one of the most emotional topics in contemporary American policing.\nAt the same time, the new policy lacks clarity in key areas and stops short of\nbright line distinctions that inform a deputy sheriff what is acceptable and\nwhat will not be tolerated.  \nChapter Two looks at risk management.  As noted earlier, runaway judg-\nments and settlements were an impetus for the Kolts Report in the ﬁrst\ninstance.  We closely follow litigation trends as a way to monitor how the\nLASD is controlling its activities with an eye to eliminating police miscon-\nduct and ensuing litigation.  The LASD is currently doing a credible job.\nIn early 2003, the Risk Management Bureau’s Civil Litigation Unit\nintroduced new management practices that show early signs of reducing the\nLASD’s litigation and liability costs.  These new programs and practices aim\nto identify claims for early resolution without litigation and to analyze high\nrisk incidents to allow for better management of ensuing litigation.  In ﬁscal\nyear 2003-2004, the number of new lawsuits ﬁled was down 27% over the\nprevious two years, despite a slight increase in the number of new claims\nﬁled.  And the total incurred liability for claims and lawsuits dropped 43%\nover the two prior years.\nWe monitor the LASD to see if it is doing all it can to correct police\nmisconduct and faulty practices that gave rise to substantial liability.  We\nlook at the LASD’s corrective action plans to see if they get to the heart of the\nproblems raised by the litigation and reduce the risk that the same mistakes\nor errors of judgment will occur again.  Chapter Three examines that question\nfrom the perspective of litigation costing Los Angeles County taxpayers more\nthan $3 million that arose from illegal strip searching of women being held\nas pre-arraignment detainees.  The chapter describes how the LASD achieved\nsubstantial compliance with a corrective action plan developed in the wake\nof that litigation.  \n3\n\n4\n\n1\nF o o t  P u r s u i t s\nIntroduction\nIn November 2004, the LASD promulgated a revised foot pursuit policy\nthat had been nearly two years in the making.  The new policy improves upon\nprior policy substantially.  In one form or another, it addresses all the topics\nthat a good foot pursuit policy should.  The LASD deserves credit for tackling\none of the most challenging topics in contemporary American policing. At\nthe same time, the new policy lacks clarity in key areas and avoids bright line\ndistinctions that inform deputies what is acceptable and what will not be\ntolerated.  As a result, it may prove difficult to discipline deputies who do\nnot comply with the policy.  Surprisingly, although some patrol stations\nhave done so voluntarily, training of deputies under the new policy is not\nmandatory.   \nClearly the drafters and negotiators of the new foot pursuit policy had\na difficult job balancing various perspectives.  There were contentious issues\nwithin the LASD and between the LASD and ALADS, the deputies’ union,\nover what role, if any, solo foot pursuits should play in contemporary\npolicing.  Not all of those issues could be resolved successfully and are now\nresurfacing in a bizarre fashion—while the LASD is gearing up to tell\ndeputies that the policy contains more absolute prohibitions than it literally\ndoes, ALADS is saying the policy is meant to encourage foot pursuits and to\ndiscourage supervisors from terminating them.  The result overall may be\neven greater confusion.\n5\n\nWe write this report against the backdrop of more than 10 years of\nconcern about foot pursuits in the LASD.  Not long after Special Counsel\nﬁrst began monitoring the Sheriff’s Department on a semiannual basis in\n1993, we turned our attention to foot pursuits of suspects and, in particular,\nsolo-deputy foot pursuits.  Solo foot pursuits occur when a deputy is acting\nalone or has split from a partner to chase a suspect.  Deputies, we found,\nwere deliberately and regularly engaging in dangerous solo pursuits, risking\nunnecessary injury or death to deputy, bystander, and suspect alike.  \nIn the shooting and force cases Special Counsel reviewed for the April 1994\nSecond Semiannual Report, we noted that deputies “seemed needlessly\nto have injected themselves into dangerous situations without ﬁrst requesting\nbackup, or a containment, or even communicating with other officers at the\nscene.”  In some of the cases, deputies engaged in solo foot pursuits after\nintentionally splitting from their partners.  Alone, without a partner’s readily-\navailable assistance, the deputies were “forced to use deadly, or near deadly,\nforce whereas if two or more officers were present, or a containment had been\nestablished, less serious force would have been necessary and officer safety\nwould have been enhanced.”  Second Semiannual Report at 34-35.\nWe revisited the issue of foot pursuits in February 2003. Out of 239 LASD\nshooting cases occurring between 1997 and 2002, 52 of the cases— or 22\npercent—involved shots ﬁred by deputies during or at the conclusion of a foot\npursuit.  Between 1994 and 2002, we found that the LASD had not “done its\nbest to curb reckless or imprudent foot pursuits where deputies disregard their\ntraining, go after suspects on foot, and wind up putting themselves, or ﬁnding\nthemselves, in grave danger and must shoot.”  Sixteenth Semiannual\nReport at 6.  This trend continues.  Out of 44 shooting cases in 2003 and\n2004 available for our review, 12 cases—27 percent—involved foot\npursuits.  \n6\n\nSome within the LASD argued that a speciﬁc foot pursuit policy was\nunnecessary because any use of force at the end of a pursuit would be investi-\ngated.  Others, with whom we agreed, pointed out that a review of a shooting\nor serious use of force at the conclusion of a solo foot pursuit would not\nexamine the question whether the foot pursuit itself constituted an act of negli-\ngence or recklessness that resulted in an otherwise avoidable and unnecessary\nshooting or an unacceptable level of risk to the deputy.  We thus recommended\nin the Sixteenth Semiannual Report that the LASD adopt a proscrip-\ntive foot pursuit policy that set up strong, albeit rebuttable, presumptions\nagainst solo foot pursuits and partner splits.\nI.  The New Policy\nTo its credit, the LASD has gone farther than nearly all other law enforce-\nment agencies in the country in formulating written policies restricting solo\nfoot pursuits.  Before the new policy was promulgated in November 2004,\nthe Department’s position on foot pursuits was set forth in Field Operations\nDirective 97-7 (FOD 97-7).  The LASD wisely recognized that FOD 97-7\nwas an inadequate tool for discouraging dangerous foot pursuits.  Rather\nthan setting forth requirements and prohibitions, the old directive was merely\na list of recommendations that provided no solid basis for disciplining deputies\nwho engaged in tactically unsound foot pursuits. \nThe LASD’s examination of its foot pursuit policy corresponded to\ncontemporaneous studies in the U.S. Department of Justice and within the\npolicymaking committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police\n(IACP), which formulated a Model Policy on foot pursuits.  Mandates for\npolice departments to adopt more restrictive foot pursuit policies soon after\nappeared in federal consent decrees and memoranda of understanding in\nlawsuits brought by the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.  The\nLASD showed foresight and initiative in deciding to look at foot pursuits on\n7\n\nits own, and there were few precedents to consider.  Copies of the LASD\nFoot Pursuit Policy and the IACP Model Policy are included at the end of\nthis chapter.\nThe new policy correctly and accurately notes that foot pursuits are\ninherently dangerous, solo foot pursuits and pursuits after partners split\nare especially dangerous, surveillance and containments are the safest way\nto apprehend a suspect, deputies should chase to contain rather than to\napprehend, and doubts about the safety of a foot pursuit should be resolved\nin favor of not initiating or continuing them.  The policy wisely mandates\nthe initiation of a broadcast at the inception of a foot pursuit.  The policy\ncorrectly tells lone deputies not to pursue suspects into buildings.\nThe policy then stops short.  Although authoritative sources within the\nDepartment state that the policy should be read to be a near total ban on\nsolo foot pursuits and partner splits, the written policy itself does not say so.\nIt fails even to set up a strong presumption against solo foot pursuits.  It fails\nto deﬁne what extraordinary or extenuating circumstances would reverse that\npresumption and justify a solo foot pursuit.  It fails to set forth a standard\nother than “common sense.”  It tells deputies not to close the distance between\nthemselves and a suspect but fails to give guidance how far back the deputies\nshould stay. \nIt establishes guidelines rather than rules.  The policy concededly sets forth\na number of “do nots,” yet says: “Common sense shall be the guiding factor in\nany decision to engage or not engage in a foot pursuit.”  The new policy tries to\nforestall some excuses deputies have used in the past to get around restric-\ntions on foot pursuits, but preserves others.  For example, foot pursuits are\noften over quickly.  Deputies had been known to get around requirements to\ninitiate a broadcast with the excuse that they did not have time to do so before\nthe pursuit had ended.  Rather than saying  that deputies must immediately\nand successfully initiate a broadcast, the new policy settles for requiring\n8\n\ninitiation of a broadcast within a few seconds, leaving the door ajar for deputies\nto claim that a chase was over before the broadcast could be made.  The new\npolicy mentions, but fails to deﬁne, what extenuating circumstances justify a\nfailure to broadcast.  The policy fails to require that unless the broadcast\nhas been acknowledged by the  Sheriff’s Communications Center (SCC), the\npursuit must be terminated.\nThe standard for judging the propriety of a foot pursuit under the new\npolicy is too low.  In the end, whether a solo foot pursuit will be judged within\npolicy turns only on whether a deputy gives a “common sense” reason for\ninitiating or continuing the chase and whether his supervisor accepts it.  Under\nthis standard, it may prove difficult to discipline deputies who engage in the\nkind of solo foot pursuits the LASD says it wants to effectively ban.  To be\nsure, the LASD could choose, as it did in the past, to impose discipline under\na “performance to standards” rationale.  But why draft a new policy that is\nnot sufficiently enforceable under its own terms?\nThe new policy is, at some important points, vague where it should be clear\nand indecisive where it should be deﬁnitive.  It has the appearance of a compro-\nmise where, at least in our view, the LASD needed to be more steadfast.\nII. Resolving Contentious Issues\nThe formulation of policy that is vague and has the appearance of com-\npromise is generally the result of a failure to resolve contentious underlying\nissues with bright line rules.  In police work, as in the law and life in general,\nfair rules must clearly set forth what is permitted and what is not; which\nexplanations will be accepted and which will not; what the consequences of\nnoncompliance will be; and the process for deciding whether noncompliance has\noccurred.  Over time, a kind of common law develops as new decisionmakers,\nconscious of how previous decisionmakers have ruled in similar circumstances,\nmake their rulings.  Consistency and predictability are hallmarks of well\narticulated policies that endure over time.\n9\n\nThe new LASD foot pursuit policy seems to be an attempt to affect a\ncompromise between those who argued for a near absolute ban on solo foot\npursuits and those who favored almost no restrictions on the exercise of a\ndeputy’s discretion to chase ﬂeeing suspects.  It papers over fundamental\nclashes of ideology:  Solo foot pursuits are favored by those who value\napprehension of the suspect above all and see the essence of good policing in\nthe chase and successful capture; solo foot pursuits are problematic for others\nwho place a high value on the safety of police officers, suspects, and third\nparties and want to temper the thrill of the chase with a more sober assess-\nment of the costs and beneﬁts involved. \nTo some, letting a suspect go under any circumstances is an insult to one’s\nmanhood and a violation of the warrior’s creed—a ﬂeeing suspect throws\ndown a challenge that brave hearts cannot decline.  Stepping back to ﬁgure\nout a way to outsmart the suspect is not sufficiently courageous and assertive.\nTo others, making an intelligent decision after consideration of the safety\nrisks and the seriousness of the offense is at the heart of professional modern\npolicing. To these persons, brains count more than brawn.  A safe capture is\npreferable to a foolish and dangerous one that ends in an unnecessary and\navoidable shooting.\nAlthough no one denies that catching a criminal is in every law enforce-\nment officer’s job description, there is wide disagreement about the safety,\nefficacy, and wisdom of solo foot pursuits.  The best thinkers in the ﬁeld, as\ndemonstrated in part by the IACP Model Policy, favor a near total ban on\nsolo foot pursuits.  Absent exigent circumstances, concludes the IACP, no\npursuit shall be commenced or continued if an officer is acting alone.  But\neven if exigent circumstances are present, a lone officer cannot pursue to\napprehend; rather, the lone officer must keep the suspect in sight and coordi-\nnate a containment for purposes of apprehension.  If the officer loses visual\ncontact, the pursuit terminates.  (IACP Model Policy at 2).\n10\n\nVery real differences in perspective and approach are not confronted\nhead-on in the LASD foot pursuit policy.  Part of this reﬂects unresolved\nissues about solo foot pursuits among Chiefs and between the Chiefs and\nmore senior management.  Most of it ﬂows from a decision by senior execu-\ntives that any new foot pursuit policy had to be acceptable to ALADS.  \nIII. Conceding Too Much Power to the Union\nIt is puzzling why law enforcement management in general, as contrasted\nto management in private industry, has ceded so many management rights\nand prerogatives to unions.  Perhaps it is easier to give up power than to ﬁnd\ndollars for pay raises or better beneﬁts.  Perhaps, since upper police manage-\nment almost always started as beat cops in the departments they now head,\nthe top brass continue to be cabined in attitudes formed as rookies, much as\nsome generals cannot move beyond the perspective of the foot soldier.  Perhaps\nit is easier for senior executives to go along with the union and be popular\nand seen as supportive than to lead and risk incurring displeasure.  Perhaps\nfrom time to time, the union calls a chit to even up an unrelated concession\nit made in the past.\nWhatever the cause, the LASD has cumulatively relinquished management\nprerogatives to ALADS.  To be sure, many other police departments, partic-\nularly some on the East Coast and the Midwest, have conceded more to\nunions than has the Sheriff’s Department.  Nonetheless, it appears that what\nhappened to the foot pursuit policy is that senior LASD executives, under\npressure from the union and perceiving a lack of unanimity among the\nDepartment’s Chiefs, pulled the emergency brakes on the new foot pursuit\npolicy.  The Chiefs themselves, perhaps unwittingly, failed to give clear\nsignals.  They received and considered an early draft and responded with\nsilence, which understandably led the drafters to assume consent.  Then when\nthe drafters came back with what they assumed to be a consensus draft,\n11\n\nsome or all of the Chiefs of the three patrol regions voiced reservations and\ncomplained about an asserted failure to have been previously consulted.\nThis in turn led to the transfer of responsibility for the foot pursuit policy\naway from one Division to another.  Ultimately, the executives sent negotiators\nto ALADS to bring back a foot pursuit policy that the union could live with.\nWhy the Department chose to go to the union is not entirely clear.  The\npolicy on foot pursuits certainly was not a subject for mandatory bargaining,\nnor was it something upon which management technically needed to meet and\nconfer.  And even if it did confer, the LASD could have agreed with the union\nto disagree and gone forward to impose the policy.  Although soliciting union\ninput and concurrence is valuable and may be pragmatically wise in many\ncircumstances, freely giving the union what is tantamount to veto power is not.\nFor whatever reason, that is what apparently occurred.  ALADS now\nboasts of it, claiming publicly that it found intolerable any limits placed on a\ndeputy’s discretion to conduct a solo foot pursuit, saw where the LASD was\nheading, and then went to the Sheriff, who let it be known that foot pursuits\nare an important tool and that he was not going to let the reputation of\nLASD deputies as aggressive crime ﬁghters suffer under his watch.  After this\ndisplay of what ALADS characterizes as leadership by the Sheriff, the union\nclaims that the tenor of the discussions with the LASD changed, and the\nLASD abandoned virtually all of the bright line rules.  (ALADS\nDispatcher, November 2004 at 3).  ALADS’ claims are obviously exagger-\nated and self-congratulatory.  But even if ALADS’ boasts are full of enough\nhot air to launch a zeppelin, it is nonetheless the case that ALADS should\nnot have been empowered as it apparently was.\nAs a consequence, the policy that ﬁnally emerged was more hortatory than\nproscriptive.  The battle about foot pursuits now has shifted from drafting\na policy to ﬁguring out what to tell deputies about it.  There, too, problems\nexist.\n12\n\nIV. Training\nFoot pursuit training under the new policy has been marked by mixed\nmessages, confusing signals, and a lack of precision.  Perhaps recognizing\nthat the policy was insufficient, senior executives within the Department\noffered assurances that regardless of what the policy failed to say, the train-\ning under the new policy would unequivocally communicate the message\nthat partner splits and solo foot pursuits are banned except in the most\nextraordinary circumstances.  One member of the LASD who was involved in\nthe policy’s creation said the LASD “separated the policy from the training\nstuff.” This suggests that the Department envisioned training as a way to\nrecoup what the LASD had given away to ALADS in the written policy.\nIf so, the strategy is not working.\nOn one hand, the LASD is trying to put forth a message that solo foot\npursuits and partner splits will now be seriously frowned upon.  On the\nother hand, it is trivializing the policy by not requiring mandatory training\nof all deputies and supervisors in patrol.  It is leaving the training to be\nconducted on a station by station basis, if at all.  The only training deputies\nreceived was dissemination of the written policy and a discussion of its impli-\ncations at daily brieﬁngs.\nIn fact, after patrol school, during which deputies/trainees will run\nthrough one foot pursuit scenario as part of a live training day, there is no\nrequired training on foot pursuits for deputies and sergeants on patrol.\nThe only time the LASD formally addresses foot pursuit tactics after patrol\nschool is during the tactical containment and pursuit lecture that is part of\nthe non-mandatory Force and Tactics class developed by the Field Operations\nTraining Unit.  By leaving the training to be made on a station-by-station\nbasis, if at all, and not providing formal, consistent training on foot pursuit\ntactics, the LASD is undercutting the stated goals of its new policy.    \n13\n\nSupervisors at one station that historically has a high number of foot\npursuits welcomed the new, more restrictive policy but were disappointed that\nDepartment-wide training was not mandatory.  They interpreted the absence\nof compulsory training as a signal that the LASD’s commitment to the new\npolicy was half-hearted.  One supervisor contrasted the mandatory training\nthat the LASD required on sexual harassment to what was happening on\nfoot pursuits, saying “commitment to training has to come from the top.”\nTo this supervisor, it spoke loudly that the Department did not make training\nmandatory.\nAt the same time that the LASD is giving mixed signals, ALADS is putting\nout its own misleading message.  The President of ALADS claims in writing\nthat the new policy “is meant to encourage...and reduce inappropriate termi-\nnations by supervisors of foot pursuits.  These were the main goals of this\npolicy.  Should any supervisor promote any theory differently please call\nme directly.”  (ALADS Dispatcher, November 2004, at 3).  ALADS further\nattempts to undercut the policy’s clear statement:  “It is the Department’s\nposition that, barring extenuating circumstances, surveillance and contain-\nment are the safest tactics for apprehending ﬂeeing persons.”  (LASD Manual\nof Policy and Procedure 5-09/220.50, Foot Pursuits).  ALADS writes: “We\nknow, as Department management should know, that statistically contain-\nments are a marginal approach to apprehending suspects.  That direct and\naggressive foot pursuits are far more productive resulting in a higher rate\nof arrests.” (ALADS Dispatcher, November 2004, at 34).  ALADS’ commen-\ntary reﬂects a stubborn refusal on the part of the union to acknowledge that\nsolo foot pursuits, in many instances, are headlong rushes into unnecessary\nand avoidable danger.  \nIndeed, ALADS continues to advertise for deputies to come forward\nwith war stories to prove that solo foot pursuits are a good idea.  (ALADS\nDispatcher, December 2004, at 6).  ALADS suggests that it has seen the face\n14\n\nof the enemy on foot pursuit policy, and that the enemy is us.  Special Counsel,\nwe learn to our amazement, has a Svengali-like effect on the LASD’s senior\nmanagement such that it springs into action whenever Special Counsel speaks.\nWould that it were so.  In truth, blaming Special Counsel is a silly attempt\nat misdirection.  ALADS’ quarrel is with the IACP and the growing move-\nment in contemporary policing to rethink the wisdom of foot pursuits.\nV. Discipline\nIt remains to be seen whether the LASD will be able to discipline officers\nfor failures to comply with the guidelines of the new foot pursuit policy.\nIn at least two cases we reviewed that occurred prior to the adoption of the\nnew policy, the LASD did impose discipline under FOD 97-7, which set forth\nthe LASD’s position on foot pursuits prior to November 2004.  The Depart-\nment’s willingness to discipline deputies for engaging in tactically unsound\nand reckless foot pursuits even under its former policy gives us some conﬁdence\nthat the LASD plans to take seriously its right to discipline officers for\nviolations of its new policy. \nCase Study No. 1\nDeputies A and B were on patrol at night when they saw four young men\nsprint across the street in front of their patrol car.  Seeing that the men were\nrunning away from the location of a liquor store, the deputies suspected that\nthe four had just held it up given that it was the only business on the block.\nThe deputies stopped their patrol car next to an empty ﬁeld and ordered the\nmen to come back.  The deputies then ordered the four men to kneel down on\nthe ground next to the patrol car.  Three suspects did as they were told, but the\nfourth feigned like he was kneeling, stood back up and ran into the open ﬁeld.  \n15\n\nDeputy A left his partner with the three kneeling suspects to chase the\none who had ﬂed.  Deputy A claimed that Deputy B urged him on, shouting,\n“Get him.” With little light, Deputy A took off after the suspect across the\nshadowy, open ﬁeld.  The darkness required Deputy A to run with his ﬂash-\nlight pointed at the ﬂeeing man.  The suspect reached for his waistband and\nturned toward the deputy, pointing a gun at him. Deputy A then ﬁred one\nround at the suspect.  Deputy A missed the suspect, who continued to run.\nIt was only at that point that Deputy A attempted to initiate a radio broadcast.\nDeputy A resumed the chase, even though his partner was behind at the\npatrol car, outnumbered by the three other suspects.  A sawed-off shotgun was\nlater found on the ground near the suspects.  One of the suspects had shotgun\nshells in his possession.  Deputy A claimed he maintained visual contact with\nhis partner throughout the entire duration of the pursuit, a dubious claim\nsince Deputy A was running through the dark ﬁeld with his back to Deputy B.\nAnd, in any event, Deputy B had his hands full guarding the three suspects.\nThe  ﬂeeing suspect turned with gun pointed toward Deputy A for a second\ntime.  Deputy A ﬁred two rounds, missing both times.  The pursuit lasted until\nthe suspect disappeared into the engrossing darkness of the ﬁeld.  Deputy A\ncrouched down, waiting to locate the suspect again.  He saw the suspect leave\nthe ﬁeld, cross a street into a yard, and jump over a fence, at which time the\ndeputy terminated the foot pursuit and returned to his partner and the other\nthree suspects. The suspect was later apprehended with a K-9 search.  \nThe deputies searched and handcuffed the three kneeling suspects after\nDeputy A returned from the ﬁeld.  It was only then that the sawed-off\nshotgun was discovered—after the suspects had been given ample time,\nhad they so chosen, to overpower and assault Deputy B.  \nDeputy A was given a three-day suspension without pay, though it was\nlater reduced to a two-day suspension held in abeyance.  Deputy A also was\nordered to attend mandatory training at Laser Village that included foot\npursuit scenarios.  The decision to impose discipline on Deputy A cannot\n16\n\nreasonably be debated, though we question whether the discipline was suffi-\ncient.  Deputy B, who allegedly urged his partner to pursue the suspect, was\nnot disciplined or retrained.   \nCase Study No. 2\nIn the early morning hours of their patrol shift, Deputies O and P followed\na vehicle that matched the description of one involved in a carjacking broad-\ncast. Deputy O leaned out of the driver’s side door and ordered the two\nsuspects in the vehicle to show their hands.  The suspects then jumped from\nthe still-rolling car and began running in different directions. \nWith no communication between the two deputies as to whom to chase\nand how to proceed, Deputy O left the patrol car and started chasing the\ndriver but then changed his mind and decided to chase the passenger.  Deputy\nO ran after the passenger a short distance up a street and into a driveway.\nWithout communicating with her partner, Deputy P elected not to follow in\npursuit but rather went back to the patrol car and radioed the deputies’\nposition to assisting units.  \nBy this point, Deputy O was engaged in a solo foot pursuit of one suspect\nwhile a second suspect was loose and possibly could have reemerged to help\nhis friend.  From what they knew about the carjacking, the deputies could\nassume that one or both the suspects were armed.  The suspect Deputy O was\nchasing stopped in the driveway next to a high, solid fence, with his back to\nthe deputy.  The suspect lunged toward the locked gate in the fence.  Deputy O\nthought the sudden movement was an attempt to grab a gun; he had seen the\nsuspect’s hands around his waistband.  Deputy O shot once and missed.  The\nsuspect leapt over the fence into the backyard of a house.  \nDeputy O claimed he next radioed that he had been involved in a shooting\nand gave the suspect’s direction of ﬂight.  The radio broadcast was somehow\nnot transmitted.  Deputy P then joined Deputy O who stood on a trash can\n17\n\nnext to the fence to see if he could spot the suspect.  Then, without coordinating\nany plan with Deputy P, and even though he could not see the suspect, Deputy\nO climbed over the fence into the dark yard.  Deputy O realized his partner\nhad not followed him over, as Deputy P yelled from the other side of the\nfence that she was going around to the front of the location.  Were the suspect\nin the backyard, he could have heard that Deputy O was now alone.  Deputy\nO swept through the backyard, with no idea where the suspect was. The\nsuspect was later apprehended in the carport at the location.  \nThe Department initiated disciplinary proceedings against both deputies,\nalthough Deputy P overturned the discipline against her by ﬁling a grievance\nthat was granted by the Department.  Deputy O received a two-day suspension\nfor failing to communicate with his partner when initiating the pursuit,\nconsider if backup units were available for containment, ensure his partner\nbroadcasted the foot pursuit, make sure Deputy P followed him over the\nfence, and to radio again after he had climbed the fence.  Again, while the\ndecision to grant Deputy P’s grievance is questionable, the LASD reached the\nright result on Deputy O’s discipline.  Only time will tell whether the new\nfoot pursuit policy, with its lack of clarity and bright line rules, will prove\nto be an effective tool for disciplining deputies and discouraging such unnec-\nessary and tactically unsound foot pursuits.  \nVI. Debriefings\nThe new policy requires that each foot pursuit be followed by a debrieﬁng\nof all involved personnel by the Watch Commander or the Field Sergeant.\nThe debrieﬁng will be documented in a foot pursuit database, and a printout\nof that database will be sent to the Captain of the unit.  Supervisors are\ntold to discuss the debriefed foot pursuits at regular station brieﬁngs.\nAlthough these procedures are a step forward, whether they are adequate\nto assure accountability and rigor in the analysis is yet to be seen.  In the past,\n18\n\nsupervisors at each station were required to ﬁll out a Foot Pursuit Evalua-\ntion Form each time a deputy reported a foot pursuit.  The form was to be\nreviewed by the Captain then sent to the Training Bureau for analysis and\nevaluation of training issues.  As we reported in our Sixteenth Semi-\nannual Report, however, that analysis by training staff never took place.\nAnd it is unclear what use, if any, supervisors and unit commanders made of\nthe forms.  The result was that sergeants, already feeling overwhelmed by\npaperwork, were forced to ﬁll out what was seen as another useless form,\nand resentment toward the bureaucracy grew.  \nYet at least some in the Department recognize the value of documenting\nfoot pursuit incidents.  Without some required form or data-gathering tool,\nthe Department cannot capture even the most basic information on pursuits:\nhow often deputies chase suspects; how long pursuits typically last; how\nfrequently deputies get hurt during a pursuit, and what type of injuries they\nsuffer; which suspects run when confronted by police; how often suspects get\ninjured; how many pursuits end in shootings or the use of signiﬁcant force.\nTo capture this and other data, the Data Systems Bureau, working with\nDepartment Commanders, has developed a foot pursuit database.  \nEvery time a deputy reports a foot pursuit, a sergeant will interview\nthe deputy and then complete a computerized form.  It will be reviewed by\nthe station’s operations sergeant, and then entered into the database.  The\ncomputerized form has two parts.  The ﬁrst serves a data collection function\nwith the goal of providing a research and tracking tool for foot pursuits so\nthat Department leaders can identify trends and problem areas.  The second\nconsists of a series of tactics questions, requiring an explanation of all the\ncircumstances surrounding the pursuit, whether alternatives were available\nand, if so, why they were not chosen.  This part of the computerized form will\nnot be tabulated in the database, but will be accessible to supervisors and\ntraining staff to review tactical and training issues.  \n19\n\nThe database and online documentation of foot pursuits will soon be\ntested as a pilot project at Industry Station, and we look forward to\nfollowing its progress.  Certainly, deputies and sergeants will be pleased\nthat the database requires no additional paperwork and that the form can\nbe filled out electronically.  Those developing the database have the best\nintentions for its implementation and potential value.  The question remains\nwhether the Department will use the information it gathers, or whether the\ndatabase will go the way of the old Foot Pursuit Evaluation Form—\na useful tool made useless by inattention.\nThe database and the computerized forms should be reviewed not only\nat the station level but also at the regional and departmental level.  There\nshould be a responsible senior executive whose task should be a regular review\nof all foot pursuits to assure consistency throughout the Department and to\nidentify problem areas that can be addressed through policy change.  The\nTraining Bureau should pay close attention to tactical issues raised by the\ninformation collected.  And Field Operations Support Services should review\nthe data to identify and suggest remedies for safety issues presented by foot\npursuits.  All who review these incidents should remember that any solo foot\npursuit, either by a single deputy working alone or after splitting from a\npartner, should be evaluated against a strong presumption that such pursuits\nare almost always wrong.\nConclusion\nFor all the good intentions and hard work that went into creating a new\nfoot pursuit policy, it is disappointing to see that the LASD, at the eleventh\nhour, stopped short.  All will agree that the new policy is a step forward.\nThe problem is that a stride forward would have been better.  It strikes\nsome of our best friends in the LASD that we are self-contradictory.  On one\nhand, we are full of praise for the Department’s initiative on foot pursuits\n20\n\nand its groundbreaking efforts to craft a written policy.  On the other hand,\nwe scold the Department for not going far enough.  \nIt is not a contradiction.  The LASD has the brains and quality of leader-\nship to be leading the nation toward smarter, more effective, and more\nprofessional law enforcement.  Its leaders grasp that excellent policing in\ntoday’s world is more a function of the cop as a strategic problem solver than\nas a freewheeling cowboy.  For these reasons, we expect great things of the\nLASD.  When they don’t cross the ﬁnish line, we are disappointed and wish\nthey had gone further.  \nBut ultimately, the question is not about our personal wishes for the\nDepartment. The question is whether from the perspective of the Board of\nSupervisors, the LASD is doing all it reasonably can to minimize taxpayer\nliability for police misconduct and dangerous, unsafe practices.  The new\nfoot pursuit policy falls short by that measure.\n21\n\nLASD FOOT PURSUIT POLICY\n5-09/220.50 FOOT PURSUITS\nPolicy\nIt is the policy of the Sheriff’s Department to assertively apprehend\nﬂeeing suspects in a manner that maximizes both public and Deputy\nsafety, while giving due consideration to Department Policy and the\nForce Options Chart.  Depending on the circumstances of an incident\nin which a suspect ﬂees, Deputies are authorized either to pursue or\ncoordinate a containment.\nFoot pursuits are inherently dangerous and require heightened officer\nsafety awareness, keen perception, common sense, and sound tactics.\nIt is the Department’s position that, barring extenuating circumstances,\nsurveillance and containment are the safest tactics for apprehending\nﬂeeing persons.  Therefore, Deputies must initiate a radio broadcast\nwith appropriate information within the ﬁrst few seconds upon initiating\na foot pursuit to ensure that adequate resources are coordinated and\ndeployed to assist and manage the operation to a safe conclusion.  The\nsafety of Department personnel and the public is paramount and shall\nbe the overriding consideration in determining whether or not a foot\npursuit will be initiated or continued.  Any doubt by participating\nDeputies or their supervisors regarding the overall safety of any foot\npursuit shall be decided in favor of communication, coordination,\nsurveillance, and containment.\nEach provision of this policy is subject to emergency exceptions.\nHowever, the Deputy or supervisor who deviates from this policy will\nbe solely responsible for explaining their actions.  Common sense shall\nbe the guiding factor in any decision to engage or not engage in a foot\npursuit, as well as in any subsequent assessment of the decision made.\nDefinitions\nFoot Pursuit Deﬁned\nA foot pursuit is an attempt by a Department member to follow or track,\non foot, a ﬂeeing person who is attempting to avoid arrest, detention,\nor observation. Terms such as“chasing to follow,”“moving containment,”\nor other terms describing similar dynamic on-foot tactical operation\nshall be subject to the following procedures governing foot pursuits.\n22\n\nPartner Splitting Deﬁned\n“Partner splitting” during a foot pursuit occurs when loss of visual\ncontact, distance, or obstacles, separates partners to a degree that they\ncannot immediately assist each other should a confrontation take place.\nFor the purposes of this policy, “partner splitting” does not pertain\nto lone Deputies assigned to static containment positions.\nProcedures\nMultiple Deputy Foot Pursuits\nWhen conducted by multiple Deputies, foot pursuits can be an\nappropriate and effective tactic.  Should partner splitting occur for\nany reason, Deputies shall be subject to the provisions of “One-Person\nFoot Pursuits” outlined below.\nInitiating Deputies’ Responsibilities\nDeputy personnel initiating a foot pursuit shall broadcast the following\ninformation to SCC within the ﬁrst few seconds:\n· Unit identiﬁer,\n· Suspect location and direction,\n· Reason for the foot pursuit,\n· Suspect description,\n·  Whether or not the suspect is armed, if known.\nBarring extenuating circumstances, if a Deputy is unable to promptly\nand successfully broadcast this information, the foot pursuit shall be\nterminated and containment immediately established.  The initiating\nDeputy shall be in ﬁeld command and bears operational responsibility\nfor the foot pursuit unless relieved by a supervisor.\nOne-Person Foot Pursuits\nOne-person foot pursuits and the splitting of partners during foot\npursuits present additional dangers to the Deputies involved.  The\ndecision to pursue must weigh the dangers of the pursuits against\nthe necessity to apprehend.\nIf a lone Deputy initiates a foot pursuit, the objective of the pursuit\nshall be to apprehend by use of a containment, subject to valid\nemergency exceptions.\n23\n\nShould the decision to initiate a one-person foot pursuit occur, the\nDeputy shall adhere to the following guidelines which include but are\nnot limited to:\n·  Do not attempt to close and apprehend but maintain visual contact only,\n·  Do not continue to pursue if visual conﬁrmation is compromised,\n·  Do not chase a suspect into a building,\n·  Should a containment be established and the suspect is within the \ncontainment, the foot pursuit shall be terminated,\n·  Should communication with SCC be lost, the pursuing Deputy shall \nimmediately terminate the pursuit.\nThis policy does not restrict Deputy Sheriffs in their mission of appre-\nhendingviolators of the law.  The policy also does not mandate that Deputy\nSheriffs put themselves at undue risk and pursue in every situation.\nField Sergeant Responsibilities\nAs with any tactical ﬁeld incident, the Sergeant does not have to be\nphysically present to assert control over the situation and may order\nthe termination of the pursuit based upon information received.  In\nsubsequent reviews for policy compliance, supervisory personnel shall\nbe prepared to clearly articulate the circumstances which supported\ntheir decision to terminate, or to allow the continuation of, a foot pursuit.\nThe Sergeant shall respond to the terminus of the foot pursuit, oversee\npost-foot pursuit discipline, and assert control as needed.  The Sergeant\nwill ensure compliance with all Department policies, speciﬁcally those\nrelating to the use of force.\nWatch Commander Responsibilities\nThe Watch Commander shall be in overall command of the operation.\nThis command responsibility shall include all Department personnel\ninvolved in the foot pursuit.\nThe Station Watch Commander shall respond to the desk area and\nimmediately take command either by establishing “cold line” commu-\nnications with the SCC Watch Sergeant or via station transmitting\ncapabilities.  Station Watch Commanders shall make a decision based\nupon their assessment of the information received regarding the\ncontinuation or termination of the foot pursuit.  In subsequent reviews\nfor policy compliance, Watch Commanders shall be prepared to clearly\narticulate the circumstances which supported their decision.\n24\n\nShould the Watch Commander be in the ﬁeld during a foot pursuit,\nthey may authorize the Watch Sergeant to assume operational control\nof the incident from the desk.  This does not alleviate the Watch\nCommander’s overall responsibility for the pursuit.\nSCC Responsibility\nUpon the initiation of a foot pursuit by a Field Deputy, SCC shall imme-\ndiately place the broadcasting Deputy on the duplex patch and request\nan Aero Bureau Unit.\nIf Deputy personnel not assigned to a Patrol Station initiate a foot\npursuit, the SCC Watch Sergeant shall notify the Watch Commander\nof the nearest Station, and they shall assume immediate command\nof the operation.\nDetective Division Personnel\nDetective Division personnel routinely engage in surveillance and\nfugitive apprehension operations.  This policy does not apply to counter-\nsurveillance or detection avoidance activities by suspects or persons\nunder surveillance.  The policy does apply to situations in which a suspect\nis actively ﬂeeing from immediate arrest, detention, or continued\nobservation by pursuing investigators.  \nShould Detective Division Investigators become involved in a foot\npursuit that requires assistance beyond those resources already involved\nand at scene, the team’s designated radio operator will advise SCC via\na SCC-monitored frequency.  SCC shall notify the Watch Commander\nof the nearest station who will facilitate the response of assisting units.\nThe Detective Division Sergeant or Lieutenant on scene will identify\nhim/herself via radio and continue command of the incident.  If no\nDetective Division supervisor is on scene, the Watch Commander of\nthe closest station will assume command of the operation.\nEvaluation and Reporting\nAll foot pursuits shall be debriefed.  It shall be the responsibility\nof the Watch Commander supervising the foot pursuit to conduct a\ndebrieﬁng of the incident with all personnel involved.  The debrieﬁng\nmay be conducted by the Field Sergeant and discussed with the Watch\nCommander who will document the debrieﬁng in the Foot Pursuit\nDatabase.  Watch Commanders shall ensure that Field Supervisors\ndiscuss debriefed foot pursuits at regular Station brieﬁngs.  The Foot\nPursuit Database printout shall be forwarded to the Unit Commander\nfor their review.\n25\n\nIACP MODEL FOOT PURSUIT POLICY\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n2\nR i s k   M a n a g e m e n t\nIntroduction\nWe last looked at the performance of the Risk Management Bureau in our\nFifteenth Semiannual Report in July 2002.  At that time, we noted\nconcerns that the LASD’s level of commitment to accountability had degraded,\nto the County’s detriment.  We said then:\nIf the management of the risk of police misconduct is less rigorous,\npotential exposure rises, and the eventual liability will cost the taxpayers\ndearly; not a happy prospect in an era where tax revenues and other sources\nof income to fund basic County services are uncertain and tight.  Even\nmore importantly, perhaps, is that a failure effectively to manage the\nrisk means that there will be more unnecessary and controversial incidents\nthat abrade the relationships between the LASD and the communities it\nserves.  Fifteenth Semiannual Report at 94.\nIn the ensuing two and a half years, the LASD attempted to address\nboth concerns.  The Department has allocated additional staff and resources\nto risk management, and new leaders at the Risk Management Bureau—\nChief Bill McSweeney, Captain Dennis Werner, and Lieutenant Shaun\nMathers— have implemented a series of positive changes in managing claims\nand litigation and disseminating the lessons learned from the incidents that\ngave rise to them.\n29\n\nIn early 2003, the Risk Management Bureau’s Civil Litigation Unit\nintroduced new management practices that show early signs of reducing the\nLASD’s litigation and liability costs.  These new programs and practices aim\nto identify claims for early resolution without litigation and to analyze high\nrisk incidents to allow for better management of ensuing litigation.  In ﬁscal\nyear 2003-2004, the number of new lawsuits ﬁled was down 27% over the\nprevious two years, despite a slight increase in the number of new claims\nﬁled.  And the total incurred liability for claims and lawsuits dropped 43%\nover the two prior years. \nAt the same time it focuses on controlling the costs of litigation, the\nLASD also is better disseminating the lessons learned from litigation and\nclaims adjudication to avoid similar problems in the future.  In July 2004,\nthe Risk Management Bureau created the Corrective Action Unit to take\nresponsibility for implementing and monitoring corrective action plans\ndrafted in the wake of substantial settlements, writing and tracking changes\nto the manuals and orders, and monitoring the Performance Mentoring\nprogram.  The new unit demonstrates the LASD’s ongoing commitment to\nreducing police misconduct and preventing future lawsuits, an approach that\nis commendable both ethically and ﬁscally.  \nNonetheless, the continuing disparity between what happens in litigation\nand what does not happen in a disciplinary proceeding remains a concern.  Of\n29 cases involving police misconduct that settled for $100,000 or more over\nthe past ﬁve years, only eight resulted in any type of discipline to the involved\nofficers or a policy change on the part of the Department.  The question we\nhave been asking since the 1992 Kolts Report—why, when the Department\nbelieves its policies and training are adequate and its officers performed in\naccordance with standards, does the County agree to pay hundreds of\nthousands of dollars in settlements?—still demands an answer.  But the\nDepartment may be moving closer to providing one.  As the LASD’s Office\n30\n\nof Independent Review’s involvement in Internal Affairs’ investigations\ncontinues to grow, the frequency of disparate results between litigation and\ninternal discipline appears to be shrinking.  Because of years-long delays\nbetween incidents and litigation outcomes, it is still too soon to report that\nthe problem has been eliminated.  We hope to be able to write that report in\nthe not-too-distant future.  \nI. Changing Approach Toward Claims and Litigation\nOne executive describes the Risk Management Bureau’s new approach to\nlitigation as “aggressively fair.”  It is a two-pronged approach:  the Civil\nLitigation Unit has made a commitment to quickly pay claims and settle law-\nsuits where an individual has been wrongfully harmed.  At the same time, it\npursues a vigorous defense of cases through trial when it believes the Depart-\nment is not at fault or the plaintiff’s settlement demand is unreasonable.  \nA. Early Settlement of Claims\nIn past years, the Risk Management Bureau sent administrative claims\nout to the involved unit for investigation and waited for the unit’s recom-\nmendation.  The Civil Litigation Unit played little role in the adjudication\nof these claims and typically would wait to see if the aggrieved individual,\nwhose claim routinely was denied following a unit-level investigation, even-\ntually ﬁled a lawsuit.  This approach was ﬂawed in at least two ways.\nFirst, the LASD lost opportunities for early and inexpensive settlement of\ndisputes.  Individuals who believe they were wronged tend to dig in their\nheels as time passes without meaningful action by the Department.  As a\nresult, cases capable of resolution early and cheaply can turn into very\nexpensive litigation with costly legal fees and lengthy pre-trial proceedings.\nSecond, opportunities for investigation and development of facts to support\na defense often were lost.  In cases not involving force and not triggering an\n31\n\nInternal Affairs investigation, the only investigation was performed by the\nresponsible unit, by individuals not necessarily trained to consider the litiga-\ntion risks associated with a given claim.  \nTo address these ﬂaws, the Civil Litigation Unit developed the Claims\nand Liability Intervention Program, or CLIP.  Instead of simply sending\nclaims out to the unit, CLIP personnel play the role of insurance adjuster,\ncontacting the responsible unit and the claimant, making an assessment of\nthe merits of the claims and, where appropriate, facilitating settlement.\nCLIP staff has learned that claimants often want an acknowledgment of\ntheir loss, fair compensation, and apology from the Department more than\nthey want signiﬁcant damages.  Ignoring their claims, however, tended to\nmake claimants angry, driving them to engage lawyers and demand greater\ncompensation.  Early resolution can dissolve that anger.\nThe Risk Management Bureau’s “claims adjuster approach” was demon-\nstrated in one recent case in which LASD personnel served a search warrant.\nIn the course of apprehending the murder suspect living in one unit of a\ntriplex, the deputies caused signiﬁcant property damage to the other two units.\nRather than waiting for adjudication of a claim, the CLIP team provided\nthe families living in those units with temporary housing, clothing, and food,\nthen worked with the owners’ insurance company to immediately begin repairs\nto the property.  Risk Management Bureau leadership points to this case as\none that, in the past, likely would have ended in litigation and a substan-\ntially greater loss to the County.  Letting the matter go to litigation also\nwould have resulted in a lost opportunity for building goodwill in the\ncommunity served by the LASD.  \nA second program, Desktop Review, allows for efficient processing of\nclaims stemming from Department-involved traffic accidents.  Traffic\nServices Detail often can determine fault without signiﬁcant investigation.\nRather than sending the claim to the unit for investigation, Traffic Services\n32\n\nDetail now reviews the ﬁle and prepares a preliminary assessment and\nrecommendation to the commander of the involved unit.  If the unit com-\nmander concurs with Civil Litigation Unit’s ﬁnding, the claim is processed.\nThe Civil Litigation Unit estimates that the Desktop Review program saves\nthe Department $250,000 annually in administrative and investigative costs\nand claims resolution.  \nB. Managing Litigation Outcomes\nIn addition to seeking early settlement of relatively small claims through\nthe CLIP and Desktop Review programs, the Department tries to get out in\nfront of larger claims and litigation through its Critical Incident Analysis\nprogram.  Civil Litigation Unit staff attempt to identify incidents, claims, or\nlawsuits that present signiﬁcant liability risk as early as possible.  The Civil\nLitigation Unit convenes a Critical Incident Analysis meeting to discuss the\nincident, identify liability concerns, develop strategies for managing the liti-\ngation, and, where appropriate, to recommend early settlement.  This program\nis notable for its timing—Critical Incident Analysis meetings often are held\nwhile a claim is pending but before litigation.  The meetings are further\ndistinguished by their inclusiveness—participants include Risk Management\nstaff, County Counsel, the commander of the involved unit, station, or jail,\nthe County Chief Administrative Office’s Risk Manager, third party adminis-\ntrators, and the Office of Independent Review (OIR).1\nThe Critical Incident Analysis program signals that Risk Management\nintends to control litigation, a shift in attitude brought by the Bureau’s new\nleaders.  This shift is as important as any speciﬁc program aimed at better\nmanagement of claims and lawsuits.  These managers have become less\n1  OIR’s presence begins to address a concern we have held since the 1992 Kolts Report,that information\ndeveloped in the course of litigation does not ﬂow to those making decisions regarding administrative\ndiscipline.  Because OIR directly participates in Internal Affairs investigations, having OIR in the room\nduring Critical Incident Analysis meetings provides an informal bridge between Risk Management and\nInternal Affairs.\n33\n\ndeferential to the County’s lawyers, both in County Counsel’s office and from\noutside ﬁrms, and now view themselves as the clients in charge of litigation.\nAnd they are not ignorant clients.  Rather than accepting the lawyers’ view\nof the relative merits and weaknesses of a given case and going along with\nrecommended settlements, Department management is now more skeptical of\ncounsel’s assessment, demanding that the lawyers explain the defenses avail-\nable and why they won’t work at trial.  These new leaders have learned the\ntrial lawyers’ lingo and, using their expertise in police work, have become\neffective risk managers.  \n“It’s our money.” This widely-heard salvo at the Risk Management\nBureau demonstrates that it takes seriously its role as manager of public\nfunds.  If the Civil Litigation Unit and the County’s lawyers determine the\nplaintiff has been injured and the LASD is at fault, the defense makes an\nearly settlement offer that it believes makes the claimant whole.  That offer\nis likely to be the highest settlement offer the plaintiff will receive.  Once \nlitigation begins in earnest, the LASD has resolved to going to trial.  As one\nexecutive put it, “if the jury decides to give the plaintiff more money, then the\npublic has spoken; but it’s not honorable for me to settle for more than I\nthink the damages actually are.”  \nIt is also the Risk Management Bureau’s intent not to settle cases where\nit believes the Department is not at fault.  As logical as this may seem, it is a\nnew approach to managing litigation.  In the past, the thinking was that the\nLASD should settle for anything less than the cost of trial.  That approach\nto risk management created at least three problems.  It gave plaintiffs and\ntheir lawyers incentive to ﬁle lawsuits without sufficient concern for how\ntheir evidence would withstand the test of trial.  It gave defense lawyers\nincentive to run up fees in discovery and legal motions, then bail out before\nthe hard work of trial began by convincing the LASD to settle.  And it drove\nofficers to a cynical view of their Department as being too willing to pay off\n34\n\nclaims rather than stand by its employees at trial.  The Risk Management\nBureau’s new approach attempts to correct all three—changing the attitudes\nboth of the LASD’s own lawyers and of the plaintiffs’ bar at the same time\nit boosts deputies’ morale.  \nII. Litigation Statistics for Fiscal Year 2003-2004\nThe Risk Management Bureau’s new approach to managing litigation\nshows early signs of successfully reducing the Department’s liability.  For\nﬁscal year 2003-2004, the LASD spent just over $5.6 million to resolve\nlawsuits, down from over $10 million in each of the prior two years.  It spent\nslightly more to resolve claims than in prior years, but the total liability for\nclaims and lawsuits still dramatically decreased, from $10.7 million in\n2002-2003 to just over $6 million in 2003-2004.  See Table 1.  Additional\ndetails regarding the LASD’s litigation activity are in Tables 4 through 8, at\nthe end of this chapter.  Importantly, the total number of lawsuits brought\nagainst the Department also dropped signiﬁcantly, from 270 in ﬁscal year\n2001-2002 and 326 in 2002-2003 to just 198 in 2003-2004.  See Table 2.\n1\nIncurred Liability 1999-2004 incurred liability\nportion for alleged \nexcessive force\n$25,000,000\n$20,000,000\n$15,000,000\n$10,000,000\n$5,000,000\n0\nFY 99-00 FY 00-01 FY 01-02 FY 02-03 FY 03-04\n35\n\n2\nLawsuits Filed 1999-2004\n350\n300\n326\n250\n282 287\n270\n200\n150 198\n100\n50\n0\nFY 99-00 FY 00-01 FY 01-02 FY 02-03 FY 03-04\nThese decreases in incurred liability and lawsuits ﬁled are not likely to be\nindicative of a reduced number of grievances against the Department, as the\nnumber of claims ﬁled in 2003-2004, a necessary precursor to litigation, went\nup compared to the prior two years.  See Table 3.\nThe decrease in liability costs, then, is more likely attributable to better\nmanagement of litigation than to improved police work.  Signiﬁcantly, while\nthe total amount paid to settle all types of claims and lawsuits went down in\n2003-2004, the percentage of the total that went to settle excessive force claims\nwent up from the prior year.  And the money spent on force related judgments\nand settlements remained roughly equal, from $2.75 million in 2002-2003\nto $2.44 million in 2003-2004.2 See Table  1.  However, because litigation\ntypically is not resolved until years after an incident, ﬁgures relating to what\nhappens in courtrooms do not give an accurate account of what currently is\nhappening in the ﬁeld.  \n2 Nor is there any sign that shootings or uses of force are declining.  In fact, for 2004, the number of officer-\ninvolved shootings was up more than 20% over the prior year, continuing an upward trend over the prior five\nyears.  See Tables 12  and 13.  And use of signiﬁcant force among the Field Operations Regions was up in 2004\nas well, from 700 incidents in 2002 and 699 in 2003 to 782 in 2004.  See Table 9. \n36\n\nThe LASD deserves praise for its improved management of litigation.  \nIts ability to settle cases early and to select wisely the cases it chooses to take\nto trial should save County taxpayers money.  But managing litigation\noutcomes is just a small part of managing risk.  It is only through training,\ndiscipline, and effective identiﬁcation and management of problem employees\nthat the Department can reduce the number of injury-causing incidents and\ntruly reduce its risk.  The Risk Management Bureau is working on this issue\nthrough its new Corrective Action Unit.  \nIII. Using the Lessons Learned  \nTo better manage the cost of litigation is good; to reduce the risk of\nsimilar incidents in the future is better.  As one executive told us, managers\n“can have all the knowledge in the world about what went wrong in a\nlawsuit but they’re limited in what they can do because the lawsuit is still\na lemon.  I may be able to make lemonade by managing the litigation well...\nbut it’s only through training and disseminating the lessons learned to prevent\nsomeone from making the same mistake....That’s where you save money.”  \n3\nClaims Filed 1999-2004\n1200\n1150\n1151\n1100\n1050\n1064\n1052\n1000 1028\n1016\n950\n900\nFY 99-00 FY 00-01 FY 01-02 FY 02-03 FY 03-04\n37\n\nOf course, it is not just a matter of saving money, but also of preserving the\npublic’s trust.  \nTo serve both ends, the LASD recently added a new lieutenant to the \nRisk Management Bureau to head a Corrective Action Unit.  Prior to this\naddition, the Risk Management Bureau was described by its Captain as a\nthree-legged table.  The Health and Safety Unit handles workers’ compensa-\ntion issues; the Discovery Unit monitors the Department’s early warning\nsystem, the PPI; Civil Litigation Unit handles litigation and develops\ncorrective action plans.  No one was directly responsible for monitoring the\nimplementation of corrective action plans, preparing and guiding changes to\nthe Manual of Policy and Procedure and Unit Orders, and overseeing the\nPerformance Mentoring (formerly “Performance Review”) process.  As of\nJuly 2004, Lieutenant Pat Hunter has held these responsibilities.  We look\nforward to reporting further on the progress of this new unit.  \nIV. Significant Settlements\nFrom the Kolts Report onward, there has been a paradoxical contra-\ndiction between Internal Affairs investigations that exonerated the officer and\nlitigation arising out of the same incident that cost the County substantial\nmoney in settlements and judgments.  Those same disparities continue to exist\nafter 2003 and 2004.  Certainly there are sometimes sound tactical reasons\nfor settling cases even when liability or the officers’ wrongdoing is disputed.\nWhile at times one might ﬁnd instances in which the County’s lawyers have\nunwisely settled, it is far more common to ﬁnd cases where the LASD let an\nofficer off the hook when a judge or jury would not.  We can only say as we\nhave in the past that these disparities “fuel[] the ﬁre of those who would\nstrip the Sheriff of the privilege of investigating and disciplining his own\nemployees.”  Fifteenth Semiannual Report at 73.    \n38\n\nBatiste v. County of Los Angeles\nIn a case that settled for $375,000, a lone deputy initiated a traffic\nstop of a van in response to an order from the Aero unit personnel who had\nspotted the van leaving the scene of a burglary.  While the deputy held the\ndriver of the van at gunpoint, another car pulled behind his patrol car and\nthe plaintiff, Ms. Batiste, got out and walked up behind the deputy, belliger-\nently complaining that it was her cousin in the van and she had done nothing\nwrong, an assertion that proved to be true.  When the plaintiff, a 110-pound\nwoman, refused to comply with orders to get back, the deputy and his newly-\narrived backup escorted her to the patrol car.  In their attempt to handcuff\nher, the plaintiff’s head slammed into the hood of the car, causing two\nchipped teeth and a fractured jaw.  The plaintiff alleged the deputies slammed\nher onto the hood of the car.  The deputies contended the plaintiff had been\nresisting, requiring them to use some force to hold her, then she abruptly\nstopped resisting and their force caused her to slam into the car.  While the\ndeputies’ story was sufficiently dubious and self-serving to create “disputed\nliability” according to the Risk Management Bureau, it somehow satisﬁed the\nInternal Affairs investigators and executives reviewing the case.  They found\nthe force used was within Departmental policy and no discipline was imposed\non either deputy, despite the fact the same two deputies had been involved in a\nsimilar incident.  \nThe County’s lawyers, on the other hand, acting here on behalf of the\ncontract cities, were not convinced a jury would ﬁnd the deputies’ version\nof the circumstances behind the use of force credible, in large part because of\nthe similar incident involving the same two deputies.  The case settled for\n$375,000.  \nBallard v. County of Los Angeles \nIn another signiﬁcant settlement, the County agreed to pay $150,000 to\nMs. Ballard following an incident in her home.  Two deputies went to Ms.\n39\n\nBallard’s apartment to investigate an embezzlement claim and smelled mari-\njuana when her boyfriend opened the door.  The plaintiff’s 14-month old\nchild toddled to the door, followed by the plaintiff.  When she refused to let\nthe deputies enter, they forced their way in to investigate a possible child\nendangerment claim relating to the marijuana use.  The plaintiff’s boyfriend\nwas quickly handcuffed, but the plaintiff ran through the apartment with\nher toddler.  The deputies reportedly feared she would injure the child with\nher tight grip.  Two back-up deputies arrived and in the ensuing struggle\nbetween the plaintiff and four deputies, the plaintiff was struck eight to ten\ntimes in the face and either fell or was pushed through a glass coffee table\nbefore being taken into custody.  The District Attorney declined to pursue\ncriminal charges against the plaintiff, but the toddler was removed from her\ncustody for 45 days pending the D.A.’s decision.\nThe LASD’s Corrective Action Plan noted some interesting liability issues,\nincluding whether eight to ten strikes to the face were necessary in a four-on-\none ﬁght, and the propriety of the officers’ warrantless entry into plaintiff’s\nhome.  According to the lawyers and Risk Management, those concerns\nwarranted a $150,000 payout.  Yet the Internal Affairs investigation ended\nwith a ﬁnding that the force used was within policy and that Department\ntraining and policy were adequate.  \nAquino v. County of Los Angeles\nIn another recently settled case, the County paid $975,000 to Ms. Aquino,\nthe ex-wife of a man who committed suicide in a Sheriff’s station lock-up.\nDeputies had responded to a 9-1-1 call from the plaintiff, who said her ex-\nhusband, Conrado Ortega, was threatening to kill himself.  Deputies detained\nMr. Ortega pursuant to section 5150 of the Welfare and Institutions Code,\nwhich allows those deemed to pose a threat to themselves or others as a result\nof a mental disorder to be held for 72 hours for evaluation and treatment.\nThe patrol deputies called the Mental Evaluation Team deputy on duty, who\n40\n\ntold the patrol deputies to take Mr. Ortega to the station lock-up.  This\ninstruction violated LASD policy and state law, both of which require that\n5150 detainees be held only in designated mental health facilities.  LASD\nstation jails are not such facilities.  Nonetheless, holding those individuals\ndetained pursuant to 5150 in station lock-ups until a MET deputy had time\nto evaluate the individual for appropriate placement in a mental health\nfacility had become a commonly accepted practice for the convenience of the\ndeputies, and was sanctioned by the unit orders governing MET team opera-\ntions.  Rather than waiting for the MET deputy or transporting Mr. Ortega\nto a designated mental health facility, the patrol deputies complied with the\nMET deputy’s request and took Mr. Ortega to the station.  \nAt the station lock-up, the patrol deputies instructed the Custody Assistant\non duty that Mr. Ortega was suicidal and was awaiting MET team evaluation,\nthen left to resume their patrol duties.  Mr. Ortega was placed in a cell where\nhe could be monitored both directly and via video camera.  Nonetheless, the\nCustody Assistant did not constantly monitor him, and Mr. Ortega attempted\nto hang himself in his cell.  LASD personnel resuscitated him, but Mr. Ortega\neventually died after lingering in a coma for four and a half months.  \nThe County paid $975,000 to settle this case, then used the litigation as\nimpetus for a signiﬁcant policy change.  The lawsuit was pending at the time\nCaptain Dennis Werner assumed command of the Risk Management Bureau\nin April 2003.  When this case came to the Captain’s attention, he immediately\nrecognized the conﬂict between state law and LASD policy, on the one hand,\nand the MET team’s unit order and common practice, on the other.  He noti-\nﬁed the Lieutenant in charge of the MET team of the illegal unit order, and\nrequested that the Undersheriff issue a teletype to all deputies to inform them\nof Department policy and state law governing 5150 detentions.  Captain\nWerner’s response to this litigation was a model of proactive risk management.\n41\n\nIn the end, the LASD gave relatively minor discipline to the MET deputy\nand Custody Assistant involved.  But this outcome, too, spurred change in the\nDepartment.  The Internal Affairs investigation in this case occurred not long\nafter OIR was established.  Prior to Aquino, OIR monitored Internal Affairs\ninvestigations, weighed in on the disciplinary action, and then closed its ﬁles.\nFollowing the outcome in Aquino, in which the initial decision on discipline\nwas substantially watered down by way of settlement, the Department agreed\nto allow OIR to monitor cases all the way through ﬁnal resolution. \nIn all, we reviewed 29 cases involving police misconduct that settled\nfor $100,000 or more over the past ﬁve years.  Only eight, including Aquino,\nresulted in any type of discipline to the involved officers or policy change on\nthe part of the Department.  However, because of the delay between the\noccurrence of a force or other misconduct incident and its resolution through\nlitigation, OIR participated in the Internal Affairs investigations of just\nthree of the 29 settled cases we reviewed.  In two of those three cases, the\nDepartment imposed discipline and implemented new policy and training\nguidelines.  We are therefore optimistic that the number of disparities between\nlitigation outcomes and the results of administrative investigations will\ndecline as the impact of OIR’s involvement in investigations continues.  \nIn our Fifteenth Semiannual Report, we raised the concern that\ninternal conﬂicts in the LASD might allow pending litigation to distort or\ndelay internal investigations into misconduct.  Then, as in the 1992 Kolts\nReport, we questioned whether “lawyers representing the LASD can strongly\nadvocate terminating an officer for misconduct knowing at the same time that\nthe fact of termination may increase the exposure of the County in litigation\narising from that misconduct.”  Fifteenth Semiannual Report at 78-79;\nKolts Report at 194.\nDespite the results in the cases noted above, the Department’s commitment\nto the integrity of the disciplinary process appears to be winning any perceived\n42\n\ntug-of-war between internal investigations and concerns about their effect on\npending litigation.  Certainly the existence of a pending lawsuit continues to\nshadow the internal disciplinary process, but the decision by new leadership\nat the Risk Management Bureau to give OIR greater access to information\nabout litigation, coupled with OIR’s continuing role as monitor and active\nparticipant in Internal Affairs investigations, gives us increased confidence\nthat appropriate disciplinary decisions will be made regardless of their\nimpact on the Department’s liability.  \nConclusion\nThough it is too soon to test statistically, we are optimistic that the new\napproach to managing litigation at the Risk Management Bureau, together\nwith the impact of OIR’s involvement in Internal Affairs investigations,\nwill close the gap in those police misconduct cases in which the County pays\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in damages yet no discipline is imposed\nand no policy or training principle slated for change.\n43\n\nTABLES\n4\nLitigation, Department Financial Summaries \nLawsuits FY 99-00 FY 00-01 FY 01-02 FY 02-03 FY 03-04\nPolice Liability $5,882,426.00 $17,948,937.00 $8,613,220.67 $4,883,000.90   $3,686,634.77\nPortion of Total   ($4,575,650.00) ($2,864,300.00) ($6,378,936.00) ($2,746,912.34) ($2,442,800.00)\nfor Alleged \nExcessive Force\nPersonnel Issues $193,400.00 $487,000.00 $782,967.00 $338,000.00 $789,000.00\nAuto Liability $442,077.00 $458,843.00 $508,505.03 $3,765,373.65 $229,991.59\nMedical Liability $139,500.00 $57,750.00 $183,999.99 $1,258,500.00 $948,000.00\nGeneral Liability $1,282.00 $500.00 $105,000.00 $131,519.80 $10,000.00\nTotals $6,658,685.00 $18,953,030.00 $10,193,692.69 $10,376,394.35 $5,663,626.36\nClaims FY 99-00 FY 00-01 FY 01-02 FY 02-03 FY 03-04\nPolice Liability $722,181.00 $102,965.00 $145,597.01 $100,957.20  $70,582.89\nPortion of Total   ($120,725.00) ($0.00) ($29,725.00) ($23,300.00) ($15,640.00)\nfor Alleged \nExcessive Force\nAuto Liability $100,963.00 $162,718.00 $229,450.54 $225,683.02 $296,686.14\nMedical Liability $0.00 $0.00 $141.50 $0.00 $0.00\nGeneral Liability $296.00 $2,722.00 $1,284.13 $259.85 $0.00\nTotal $823,440.00 $268,405.00 $376,473.18 $326,900.07 $367,269.03\nIncurred  $7,482,125.00 $19,221,435.00* $10,570,165.87 $10,703,294.42 $6,030,895.39\nClaims/Lawsuits\nLiability Total\n* One settlement, in Valentin v.

County of Los Angeles and Beaudoin v. County of Los Angeles.\nThis chapter reports publicly on our ﬁndings. \nIt is heartening to report that the LASD is in substantial compliance with\nthe Corrective Action Plan developed in response to those lawsuits.  The most\nsigniﬁcant corrective actions—the development and implementation of policies\nand procedures to minimize the risk of unlawful strip searches of pre-arraigned\ninmates—have been fully implemented.  New policies to ensure that County\nCounsel reviews and approves all proposed revisions to the Custody Division\nManual prior to publication have likewise been fully implemented.  The\nDepartment also is complying with other corrective actions, such as ensuring\nthat all custody units promptly distribute, brief, and document each revision\nto the Manual.  We also identiﬁed opportunities for the LASD to improve upon\nthe corrective action it has taken to date.  We report our ﬁndings and recom-\nmendations below.\nI. Background\nA . The Lawsuits\n1.  Musso v. County of Los Angeles  \nMusso arose from the LAPD’s August 15, 2000 misdemeanor arrests of a\ngroup of bicyclists engaged in a protest at the 2000 Democratic National\n53\n\nConvention.  The cyclists were charged with reckless driving and were turned\nover to the LASD, which transported them to the LASD’s Inmate Reception\nCenter (IRC) for processing.  The male arrestees were assigned to two dormi-\ntories in the Men’s Central Jail (MCJ), while the females were assigned to\nModule 231 of the Twin Towers Correctional Facility (TTCF).  Before the\nbicyclists were led to their assigned housing, they were searched by LASD\npersonnel.  At MCJ, the 38 male arrestees were subjected to pat-down searches\nand ordered to remove their personal property, shoes, and socks.  At TTCF,\nhowever, the 23 female arrestees were subjected to pre-arraignment strip\nsearches and visual body cavity examinations by female officers.  The LASD\nhas since acknowledged that these strip searches violated California law.  \nThe next day, August 16, the protesters appeared in court for their\narraignment.  Upon returning from court, the 23 women were subjected to a\nsecond, post-arraignment strip search before re-entering TTCF.  Because the\nwomen had all been arraigned, this second strip search did not violate Penal\nCode Section 4030.  The charges against all of the protesters were dismissed\nseveral days later upon a motion of the District Attorney’s Office.  \nAt the time of this incident, TTCF’s policy and practice was to conduct\nstrip searches and visual body cavity inspections of all arrestees before intro-\nducing them into the general jail population, in violation of Penal Code\nSection 4030(f), which provides that misdemeanor and infraction arrestees\nmay not be strip searched prior to arraignment unless (1) they are charged\nwith an offense involving weapons, drugs, or violence or (2) there is reason-\nable suspicion that they are concealing a weapon or contraband.  At the time\nof the incident, the LASD was in the process of modifying its Custody\nDivision Manual to correctly state the legal standard under this law.    \nOn April 27, 2001, the Musso protesters ﬁled a class action alleging,\namong other things, that the female prisoners were illegally strip searched.\nOn April 22, 2003, the Board authorized payment of $2.75 million to settle\n54\n\nthe lawsuit, with the bulk of the payment going to the female prisoners who\nwere illegally strip searched.  \n2. Beaudoin v. County of Los Angeles\nBeaudoin occurred nearly four months after the Musso incident and\ninvolved a similarly unlawful strip search at TTCF.  In the late afternoon\nof December 5, 2000, Lomita Station deputies arrested Ms. Brandi Beaudoin\non a $26,000 warrant for driving with a suspended license.  While being\nbooked at Lomita Station, Ms. Beaudoin informed LASD officers that she\nwas six months’ pregnant.  The Lomita officers, pursuant to LASD policy,\ndetermined that Ms. Beaudoin should be transferred to Twin Towers so that\nmedical staff could evaluate her condition.  Shortly before she left Lomita\nStation, Ms. Beaudoin twice telephoned her husband and requested that he\npost a bond for her release.  \nMs. Beaudoin left Lomita Station at approximately 6:50 p.m. and\narrived at the Inmate Reception Center at roughly 8:00 p.m.  At 10:09 p.m.,\nthe IRC cashier received a bond for Ms. Beaudoin’s release.  The documenta-\ntion for Ms. Beaudoin’s release, however, was not received by IRC’s Records\nCenter until 12:40 a.m.  By this time, Ms. Beaudoin was part of a line of\n“new bookings” transferring into Twin Towers.  After arriving at Twin\nTowers, but prior to being placed into the general jail population, Ms.\nBeaudoin was subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity inspection.\nThis search violated Penal Code Section 4030.  Ms. Beaudoin spent the night\nin jail and was released at 5:27 a.m. on December 6. \nA week after her release, Ms. Beaudoin twice went into premature labor\nthat required medical attention.  On March 31, 2001, Ms. Beaudoin ﬁled a\ncivil claim with the County alleging, among other things, that she had been\nillegally strip searched.  On May 22, 2001, Ms. Beaudoin ﬁled suit in Los\nAngeles Superior Court.  In 2002, the County agreed to settle her claims for\n$150,000.   \n55\n\nB. California Penal Code Section 4030 \nCalifornia Penal Code Section 4030 was enacted in 1984 to strictly limit\nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches conducted by law enforcement\nagencies.  The statute provides in relevant part:  \nNo person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or infrac-\ntion offense, except those involving weapons, controlled substances or\nviolence...shall be subjected to a strip search or visual body cavity search\nprior to placement in the general jail population, unless a peace officer\nhas determined there is reasonable suspicion based on speciﬁc and articulable\nfacts to believe such person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and\na strip search will result in the discovery of the weapon or contraband.\nNo strip search or visual body cavity search or both may be conducted\nwithout the prior written authorization of the supervising officer on\nduty.  The authorization shall include the speciﬁc and articulable facts\nand circumstances upon which the reasonable suspicion determination\nwas made by the supervisor.  (Cal. Penal Code § 4030(f)).\nThe provision set forth in Section 4030 restricting strip searches of pre-\narraignment arrestees led to great confusion within the LASD.  For many\nyears, there were sharply conﬂicting views about what it meant.  \nC. A History of the LASD’s Strip Search Policies\nup to the Musso and Beaudoin Incidents\n1. Custody Division Policies\nAlthough Penal Code Section 4030 was enacted in 1984, the earliest\nwritten policy produced by the LASD is Custody Division Order Number 64\n(“CDO #64”), issued on September 12, 1989.   CDO #64 began with an accu-\nrate description of Penal Code Section 4030(f), then erroneously concluded\n56\n\nthat the restrictions on strip searches and body cavity inspections “do not\napply to inmates already in the general jail population.”  According to the\npolicy, “general population” inmates could be subjected to a strip search or\nbody cavity search merely for a “valid reason.”  The LASD’s interpretation\nwas erroneous in that it did not clearly definewhat protection, if any, was\nafforded to pre-arraigned inmates once they had completed jail intake\nprocessing and subsequently became part of the general jail population. \nIt appears that the LASD published CDO #64 without ﬁrst obtaining\napproval from County Counsel.  Nonetheless, in October 1989, just over a\nmonth after the policy was issued, the LASD was alerted to possible consti-\ntutional problems in the order.  The LASD appears not to have responded\nto the alert, and CDO #64 was thus the operative policy of the LASD from\nSeptember 1989 to January 1999 despite legal inﬁrmities. \nOn January 14, 1999, the LASD revised Custody Division Manual\n(“CDM”) Section 3-09/000.00, which set forth the Department’s rules\nregarding inmate searches.  As with CDO #64, the revision was published\nwithout prior review or approval by County Counsel.  This revision of\nSection 3-09/000.00 did not discuss the strictures of Penal Code Section\n4030.  Nor did it state any guidelines for conducting strip searches.  Instead,\nthe revised policy simply stated that each custody facility was to “develop\nand implement policies and procedures governing searches to ensure that the\nsecurity of the unit is maintained.”\nIn late 1999 and early 2000, the LASD began reviewing and rewriting\nthe entire Custody Division Manual.  On May 17, 2000, roughly ﬁve months\nbefore the Musso incident, the Department issued a draft revision of CDM\nSection 3-09/000.00.  Unlike its predecessor, this draft of the policy expressly\ndiscussed the protections of Penal Code Section 4030 and made clear that\npre-arraigned inmates were not to be subjected to a strip search or a visual\nbody cavity inspection unless (1) they had been arrested for an offense\n57\n\ninvolving drugs, weapons or violence or (2) there was reasonable suspicion\nthat they were in possession of a weapon, drugs, or contraband.  \nThis time, in correspondence between June 2000 and January 2001,\nthe Department did seek County Counsel’s prior review and approval of\nthe proposed change to policy.  The Musso and Beaudoin incidents occurred\nduring this time period. \n2. Twin Towers’ Policies Regarding Strip Searches\nUnder LASD policy, each custody facility is empowered to issue its\nown Unit Orders.  These orders cannot be less restrictive than the Custody\nManual or Custody Division orders.  Like other LASD custody facilities,\nTwin Towers had its own Unit Orders regarding strip searches.  Twin\nTowers’ strip search policy was set forth in Unit Order Section 03-09-10.\nRoughly six months prior to the Musso incident, Unit Order Section\n03-09-10 was re-reviewed and re-approved by the Custody Division as part of\nits biennial review process.  \nThe Department apparently did not ask County Counsel to participate in\nits biennial review of Unit Order 03-09-10 and previously did not\nregularly involve County Counsel in the drafting or modiﬁcation of Unit\nOrders.  This proved unfortunate, as the LASD’s own internal review\nprocess failed to identify serious ﬂaws with the order.  Among other things,\nthe Twin Towers Unit Order erroneously stated that “[a]ll inmates and\ntheir property are subject to search at any time” without acknowledging that\nPenal Code Section 4030(f) strictly prohibited strip searches of certain types\nof pre-arraigned inmates.  These errors laid the groundwork for the unlaw-\nful searches that occurred in Musso and Beaudoin.  \n58\n\nD. Policy Changes After the Musso and Beaudoin\nIncidents\nIn February 2001—ﬁve months after the Musso incident and nearly three\nmonths after Beaudoin—an LASD Assistant Sheriff completed an audit of\nsearch procedures at the Inmate Reception Center, Men’s Central Jail, and\nTwin Towers.  He found that both IRC and MCJ complied with Penal Code\nSection 4030 because they did not strip search pre-arraigned inmates unless\nthey fell within one of the exceptions speciﬁed in Section 4030(f).  He found\nTower I of Twin Towers also complied with the statute.  On the other hand,\nhe found that Tower II continued to conduct strip searches and body cavity\ninspections of all female inmates prior to entering the facility.  The Assistant\nSheriff immediately issued an oral stop order prohibiting all strip searches\nof pre-arraigned inmates entering the jails unless one of the exceptions to\nPenal Code Section 4030(f) applied.  \nShortly after the Assistant Sheriff issued his stop order, Twin Towers\ndrafted a revised version of Unit Order Section 03-09-10 that clearly stated\npre-arraigned inmates were not to be strip searched unless one of the excep-\ntions to Penal Code Section 4030(f) applied.  Although the revised Unit\nOrder apparently was not published, the new, proper strip search restric-\ntions were nonetheless put into daily practice.  \nOn June 25, 2002, LASD executives signed a revised version of the\nCustody Division Manual Section 3-09/000.00.  The revision clearly and\naccurately states the legal restrictions on strip searching pre-arraigned\ninmates.  On January 9, 2003, the LASD published its ﬁnal revision of\nSection 3-09/000.00.  Unfortunately, however, the LASD did not have\nprocedures to ensure that employees at each facility actually received the new\npolicy and were briefed on its application.  Recognizing this lapse, one month\nlater the Department redistributed the new policy and documented that the\npolicy had been handed out again and brieﬁngs provided.  \n59\n\nII. The LASD’s Corrective Action Plan\nIn the spring of 2003, the LASD, in connection with the Board’s consid-\neration of proposed settlements of Musso and Beaudoin, conducted several\ninternal analyses of its policies and practices and developed a series of\nproposed corrective actions:\n1. Develop a system for tracking, easily identifying, and segregating pre-\narraigned inmates so that they will not mistakenly be strip searched in\nviolation of Penal Code Section 4030. \n2. Develop measures to ensure that Custody and Correctional Services\npersonnel are regularly briefed regarding the strictures of Penal Code\nSection 4030 and have an easy means for refreshing their knowledge.  \n3. Develop a policy to ensure that County Counsel will promptly and\nconsistently review all LASD custody-related policies and policy revi-\nsions prior to publication.\n4. Develop a system for tracking custody-related policies that are currently\nunder revision.  \n5. Develop a system to ensure that revisions to custody-related policies are\nconsistently distributed to affected employees, and that such distribution\nis documented and veriﬁed.  \nFurthermore, at the request of the Board of Supervisors, the Department\nagreed to conduct a series of audits to report on the implementation of each\ncorrective action.  Two of these audits were conducted in June and July 2003.\nA third audit was conducted in August 2003.  Finally, a year-end review was\nprepared in December 2003.  The Department, through the Custody Support\nServices Management Unit, continues to conduct quarterly audits of custody\nfacilities’ compliance with these corrective actions.\n60\n\nIn addition to reviewing the LASD’s internal audit reports, we conducted a\nseries of our own audits, which occurred between September 2003 and August\n2004.  Our ﬁndings are set forth below.  \nIII. Implementation of the Corrective Action Plan\nA. System to Track, Easily Identify, and Segregate  \nPre-Arraigned Inmates\nThe LASD implemented this corrective action in July 2003.  The corrective\naction consists of three components.  First, all pre-arraigned inmates processed\nthrough the Inmate Reception Center receive a yellow wristband to readily notify\ncustody personnel that the inmate has not yet been arraigned.  Second, when new\narrestees are entered into the LASD’s computerized inmate tracking system, staff\nentering the inmates’ data place a ﬁve-day hold on the inmates with the notation\nthat they have not yet been arraigned.  In connection with an anticipated upgrade\nof the computerized tracking system, the LASD expects that in the future, new\narrestees will automatically receive an electronic identiﬁer indicating that they\nhave not been arraigned and thus generally are not subject to strip search, elim-\ninating the potential for human error in data entry that could lead to an inmate’s\nmisclassiﬁcation.  This system upgrade, however, will not be accomplished for\nsome indeﬁnite period of time.  Finally, pre-arraigned inmates are segregated from\nthe general jail population to minimize the risk that they may introduce hidden\nweapons or contraband into the general population.  This measure also reduces\nthe risk that pre-arraigned inmates will be mistakenly subjected to strip search.  \nBoth the LASD’s internal audits and our own audits found the LASD\nto be fully compliant with this corrective action.  The segregation procedures\nwere clearly articulated in a July 2, 2003 temporary directive issued by Custody\nDivision Chief John Scott and Correctional Services Chief Charles Jackson.\nThe directive will ultimately be replaced by a new policy in the Custody\nDivision Manual, Section 5-01/031.00.  \n61\n\nEffective March 6, 2004, the Department, as a cost-saving measure, began\nhousing pre-arraigned individuals arrested by LASD officers at the station\nwhere the individual was arrested.  As a result of this measure, the number of\npre-arraigned inmates ﬂowing through the Inmate Reception Center and into\nthe jail facilities has been reduced by roughly one-third.  As a consequence, there\nare substantially fewer opportunities for pre-arraigned inmates to be mistaken\nfor general population inmates and thereby become unlawfully subjected to\nstrip search.  In addition, because the individual patrol stations are not\nhousing large numbers of prisoners, there have been, as far as we could tell,\nvery few strip searches conducted by station jailers.  We did not ﬁnd any indi-\ncation that problematic strip searches have occurred at the station holding\ncells.  Nonetheless, because the responsibility for handling LASD arrestees\nprior to arraignment has been spread out among the patrol stations, we\nrecommend that the Department regularly monitor the stations to ensure\nongoing compliance with the strictures of Penal Code Section 4030.  \nB. Measures to Ensure LASD Personnel are Aware\nof the New Strip Search Policy Restrictions \nThe LASD ﬁrst implemented this corrective action in the winter and spring\nof 2003.  The ﬁrst component of the corrective action required distribution\nof the revised strip search policy to all Custody Division and Correctional\nServices Division employees, as well as a formal brieﬁng that was to be docu-\nmented and kept on ﬁle.  We have reviewed each unit’s documentation of the\nbrieﬁngs and are satisﬁed that the LASD has fully implemented this measure.\nThe second component was the distribution of an informational bulletin\ndescribing in more detail the contours of the revised strip search policy.  The\nDepartment circulated this bulletin in February and March 2003.  \nA third component was the creation of a pocket-sized information card\nentitled “Strip Search Policy of Pre-Arraigned Inmates.”  The card was\n62\n\ndeveloped by Twin Towers for distribution to all custody facilities and IRC.\nInitially, the Department’s implementation of this measure was slow, but by\nthe end of 2003, the LASD reported that all of the custody facilities were in\ncompliance.  From September 2003 to August 2004, we periodically spot audited\nthe custody facilities and found the information cards readily available.  In\naddition, all of the employees we spoke to acknowledged receiving a card, and\nseveral employees were able to produce the card from their rear pockets or\ngear bags.  \nAs discussed above, effective March 6, 2004, LASD patrol stations were\nassigned the duty of housing all pre-arraigned inmates arrested by LASD\npersonnel.  According to Custody Support Services and IRC, each of the patrol\nstation jailers were briefed upon the strictures of Penal Code Section 4030\nand provided information cards.  However, while Custody Support Services\nconducts random audits of all jail facilities under its command to ensure\ncompliance with this element of the Corrective Action Plan, the LASD has not\naudited the patrol station jails to monitor compliance.  Between March and\nJuly 2004, we spot audited a sample of eight patrol stations and found the\ninformation cards were available.  We recommend that Field Operations\nSupport Services periodically perform audits of patrol station lock-up facili-\nties to ensure that their staffs are familiar with the LASD strip search policy.  \nC. Ensure County Counsel Will Consistently Review\nand Approve Custody Policy Prior to Publication\nOn March 27, 2003, the Department revised Custody Division Manual\nSection 1-05/000.00 to make clear that County Counsel must approve all\nproposed Manual revisions before they are published and circulated to concerned\npersonnel.  In addition, the Department created a form to document that a given\nmodiﬁcation has been reviewed and approved by County Counsel. Beginning in\nSeptember 2003, we conducted periodic audits to test whether this policy was\n63\n\nbeing followed.  We are satisﬁed that the Department was and remains in full\ncompliance with new policy.  \nWe nonetheless recommended that the policy be expanded.  While Section\n1-05/000.00 does require prior County Counsel review and approval of any\nchanges to the Custody Division Manual, it does not require prior review\nand approval of changes to policies not set forth in the Manual, such as the\nUnit Orders promulgated by each custody facility.  This recommendation\nis necessary because the Unit Orders contain rules and procedures that affect\ninmates’ substantive rights.  It is worthwhile to recall that the illegal\nsearches conducted in Musso and Beaudoin were carried out pursuant to a\nlegally-ﬂawed Unit Order issued by Twin Towers. \nThe Custody Division recently issued a directive requiring all custody\nfacilities to submit their Unit Orders to Custody Support Services for review\nand County Counsel approval.  While this directive has not yet been formalized\nin the Custody Division Manual, it is being implemented in practice.  County\nCounsel and Custody Support Services staff are reviewing all existing Unit\nOrders and will, going forward, review all proposed modiﬁcations.  We\nrecommend that this practice continue and be formulated in policy.\nWe also recommend that the LASD amend its Manual of Policy and\nProcedure, which sets forth rules and procedures affecting the Department\nas a whole, to require prior County Counsel review and approval of all\nLASD policies and procedures.  While it appears that such prior review and\napproval regularly occurs in practice, we believe the better course is to\nformalize the practice in policy.1\n1 Section 1-01/040.00 of the LASD’s Manual of Policy and Procedure sets forth the procedure for revising the\nManual.  It does not state whether County Counsel must review and approve proposed revisions prior to\npublication.  Instead, the section merely states, “Upon concurrence and approval by all [LASD] Divisions,\nthe proposed MR [manual revision] shall be routed to the Sheriff, through channels, for approval to be\npublished and established as Department policy and procedure.”    \nIn addition, Manual Section 3-09/210.00, which discusses County Counsel’s role in providing the LASD with\nformal and informal legal opinions, does not provide that proposed policy revisions are to be automatically\nrouted to County Counsel for review and approval prior to publication.  Instead, the section merely sets\nforth a protocol for seeking County Counsel input on a case-by-case basis.   \n64\n\nD. System for Tracking Outstanding Revisions to\nthe Custody Division Manual\nOn April 1, 2003, the LASD developed a spreadsheet report that lists all\nongoing revisions to the Custody Division Manual.  In addition to identifying\nthe policies being revised, the report brieﬂy states (1) the date the revision was\nordered; (2) the nature of the revision in progress; (3) the unit currently\nworking on the revision and the speciﬁc individual responsible for the work;\n(4) the date the unit received the revision; and (5) the current status of the\nrevision.  \nEach month, Custody Support Services circulates updated reports to the\nCommanders and Chiefs of the Custody and Correctional Services Division.\nWe have periodically reviewed these reports and are satisﬁed that the spread-\nsheet is kept up to date and effectively tracks pending revisions.  We recom-\nmend, though, that the monthly report be expanded to track revisions not\nonly to the Custody Division Manual but also of Unit Orders and other\ncustody policies and procedures.  The LASD also should consider applying\nthis tracking system Department-wide, so that there is one single report to\ntrack all LASD policies currently undergoing revision, not just those relating\nto custody operations.  \nE. System to Ensure Consistent, Verifiable Distri-\nbution of Custody Division Manual Revisions\nThe March 27, 2003 revision to Custody Division Manual Section 1-\n05/000.00 not only provided for consistent County Counsel review of\nproposed manual revisions, but also added mechanisms to ensure that each\nrevision was distributed in a uniform manner, concerned employees were\npromptly briefed about the revision, and each brieﬁng was fully and consis-\ntently documented.  Policy revisions that signiﬁcantly impact custody-related\n65\n\noperations or that address risk management issues are designated as\n“Formal Revisions.”  Upon receiving a Formal Revision from Custody\nSupport Services, each unit commander of a custody facility is responsible\nfor ensuring that each relevant employee under his or her command receives a\nformal brieﬁng and receives a hard copy of the new or revised policy.  Those\nemployees so briefed must sign an acknowledgement sheet to be maintained at\nthe facility for at least ﬁve years.  In addition, an electronic copy of the new\nor revised policy is issued to all personnel.  \nImplementation of this new policy initially was uneven.  Our spot audits\nrevealed noncompliance by several facilities.  However, the most recent audits,\nby Special Counsel and the Department, showed all facilities in compliance\nwith this aspect of the Corrective Action Plan.  Given the previously uneven\ntrack record, we recommend that Custody Support Services continue to \nregularly conduct spot audits of facilities to ensure that they are consistently\nand promptly distributing, brieﬁng, and documenting changes to the Custody\nDivision Manual.  \nConclusion\nAs the above discussion demonstrates, the Department is in full compli-\nance with the most critical and crucial aspects of the Corrective Action Plan.\nThe risk of illegal strip searches of pre-arraigned inmates has been substan-\ntially reduced.  New policies to ensure that County Counsel reviews and\napproves all proposed revisions to the Custody Division Manual prior to\npublication have been fully implemented.  The Department has taken signiﬁ-\ncant steps to reduce the risk of the kind of errors that led to the County’s\nliability in Musso and Beaudoin. We urge the LASD to diligently monitor\ncustody facilities’ ongoing compliance with the restrictions on lawful strip\nsearches to avoid such errors in the future.  \n66\n\n\n\n68",

      "title": "Minutes of the Board of Supervisors, County of Los Angeles, State of California",
      "text": " \n \nChairperson of the Los Angeles County Claims Board \nCounty Counsel \n \n \nAt its meeting held March 25, 2003 Board took the following action: \n \n35 \n   The following item was called up for consideration: \n \n The Los Angeles County Claims Board's recommendation to authorize \nsettlement of case entitled, Juliet Musso, et al. v. County of Los Angeles, \nLos Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC 249 462, in amount of \n$2,750,000; and instruct the Auditor-Controller to draw a warrant to \nimplement this settlement from the Sheriff's Department's budget. \n \n   On motion of Supervisor Antonovich, seconded by Supervisor Burke, unanimously \ncarried (Supervisor Molina being absent), the Board took the following actions: \n \n1.  Adopted the Los Angeles County Claims Board's aforementioned \nrecommendation; and \n \n2.  Continued the Corrective Action Plan one week to April 1, 2003. \n \n   Later in the meeting, on motion of Supervisor Antonovich, seconded by Supervisor \nYaroslavsky, unanimously carried, the Board reconsidered the foregoing motion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Continued on Page 2) \n \n- 1 - \n\nSyn. 35  (Continued) \n \n \n   Supervisor Molina made the following statement: \n \n   “The analysis and corrective action plan presented to the Board of \nSupervisors pertaining to the settlement in the Musso strip search litigation \nindicates that in the past County Counsel’s review of the Sheriff’s policies \nregarding strip searches was not consistently performed.  This resulted in \na policy at Twin Towers that lacked the clarity and specificity to prevent \nthe unlawful strip searches that occurred in the Musso case, the Beaudoin \ncase, and resulted in very costly settlements.  The Corrective Action Plan \nstates that in the future County Counsel shall review Sheriff policy and \npolicy changes. \n \n   “The history of strip search litigation indicates that lessons have not \nbeen quickly learned from litigation and mistakes have been repeated \nresulting in costly settlements for the same mistake.  The \nWilliams/Tchakmakjian cases filed in 1997 resulted in two rulings in \n1998, and 1999 by Judge Pfaelzer declaring the Sheriff’s policy of strip \nsearching prerelease detainees violated the Fourth Amendment of the \nU.S. Constitution.  Yet, a year and one-half later, the Musso plaintiffs were \nsubjected to prerelease strip searches.  Furthermore, it was not until \nJune 2002, three and one-half years after the Pfaelzer rulings that the \nSheriff’s policy was changed to comply with the rulings. \n \n   “Consequently, it is imperative that County Counsel’s review of Sheriff \npolicies is done with most comprehensive and timely manner with the goal \nof risk management and avoidance of costly litigation.” \n \n   After discussion, on motion of Supervisor Molina and by common consent, there \nbeing no objection, the Board took the following actions: \n \n1.  Continued to Closed Session on April 1, 2003, the Los Angeles Claims \nBoard’s aforementioned recommendation; and  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Continued on Page 3) \n \n- 2 - \n\nSyn. 35  (Continued) \n \n \n2.  Instructed the County Counsel to present a plan to the Board within \n30 days for the review of Sheriff policies which includes the criteria for \nreview, a timeline for review, a process for review of relevant law and \ncase law governing the policies, and a process for informing the Sheriff \nand the Board on policy areas that may present legal and financial risk. \n \n5032503-35 \n \nAttachment \n \nCopies distributed: \n  Each Supervisor \n  Sheriff \n  Chief Administrative Officer \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n- 3 - ",

This is an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against on behalf ofp eople \n4  who are arrested, whether lawfully or unlawfully, and taken to Los Angeles County Jails and unlawfully \n5  subjected to visual body cavity searches pursuant to a long-standing blanket policy and practice.  The \n6  searches are conducted without probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that weapons or \n7  contraband are being concealed. For the unlawful searches and other jail conditions, plaintiffs and class \n8  members also seek compensatory damages from defendants COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, LOS \n9  ANGELES SHERIFF DEPARTMENT, and their officials and employees and punitive damages from \n10  their individual employees. \n11  2.  Plaintiffs also seek compensatory damages for false arrest and other deprivations of \n12  their rights from defendant CITY OF LOS ANGELES and its officials and employees and punitive \n13  damages from the individual employees. \n14  3.  Each claim herein arises out of an incident within this judicial district in the City of \n15  Los Angeles commencing on August IS, 2000, and involves Los Angeles County officials and deputy \n16  sheriffs assigned to the jails, and Los Angeles City police officers and officials, in the County of Los \n17  Angeles, State of California. \n18  4.  On or about October 11, 2000, pursuant to Government Code §91O et seq., and in \n19  substantial compliance therewith, plaintiffs, as individuals and members of the class, and on behalf of \n20  themselves and the members of the class, presented a claim for damages to the Board of Supervisors of \n21  defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES.  Said claim was denied by operation of law on or about \n22  November 25, 2000.  A supplemental and amended claim was presented to said Board of Supervisors \n23  on behalf of all putative class members on February 15,2001. Said supplemental and amended claim \n24\"  was denied by operation oflaw on or about March 30, 2001. \n25.1  5.

A supplemental and amended \nC \n5 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n\n•  • \n1  claim was presented to said City Council on behalf of all putative class members on February 15,2001. \n2  Said supplemental and amended claim was denied by operation of law on or about March 30, 200 I. \n3 \n4  INTRODUCTION \n5  6.  On August 15,2000, during the Democratic National Convention, plaintiffs were \n6  lawfully and peacefully riding their bicycles in a group of approximately 100 to 200 people.  Some or \n7  all of plaintiffs were riding to participate in the ongoing political process and to demonstrate their \n8  support for a non-polluting means of transportation.  They were suddenly surrounded by Los Angeles \n9  police officers who escorted them through traffic signals and corralled them into a location away from \n10  public view where, in the presence of and with the personal approval of defendant Chief of Police \n11  Bernard Parks,  they were arrested without warrants or probable cause to believe they had committed \n12  any crime. They were handcuffed by a fence under the 110 Freeway for an unreasonable period of time \n13  and despite their right to be released upon their promise to appear to answer to any charges, they were \n14  herded onto buses and taken to jail where they were imprisoned. Plaintiffs' bicycles and other items of \n15  property were unlawfully seized and were damaged.  Misdemeanor charges were fabricated to justify \n16  an unreasonable bail and to prolong plaintiffs' false imprisonment. \n17  On two separate occasions, the twenty-three women who were arrested were subjected \n18  to strip searches and visual body cavity searches. One oft he occasions was prior to arraignment and the \n19  second was after all charges had been dismissed. It is a crime under California law to subject a \n20  misdemeanor arrestee to a strip or visual body cavity search prior to arraignment without probable cause \n21  or reasonable suspicion to believe that the person is concealing weapons or contraband.  The searches \n22  were done in a corridor in the County Jail in the presence of each other and numerous others with the \n23  intent to humiliate and embarrass the women. \n24  The women were transported  to and from court shackled together with chains and all \n(. \n25.l  plaintiffs were subjected to unlawful jail conditions and treatment. Telephone calls were unlawfully and \nr \n26~ unreasonably delayed and denied; medications were withheld; basic hygiene products were not provided; \n1 \n27 ~  such food as was provided was provided late, was inedible, moldy and/or did not comply with dietary \n~ \n28; requirements; and plaintiffs were imprisoned for approximately 12 hours after all charges against them \n1 \n1  6 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n\n•  • \n1  had been dismissed. \n2 \n3  PARTIES \n4  Plaintiffs \n5  7.  Plaintiffs JULIET MUSSO, SUSANNE BLOSSOM, RON MILAM, DEREK \n6  IVERSON, and CHRISTOPHER WEARE are each residents of the County of Los Angeles, and each \n7  pays taxes in and to said County and each has done so within the past year.  They sue herein as \n8  individuals, class representatives and as taxpayers of defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. \n9  8.  PlaintiffM  ELISSA BOYD is a resident of the State of California and sues herein \n10  as an individual and class representative. \n11  9.  Plaintiffs JULIET MUSSO, SUSANNE BLOSSOM, RON MILAM, DEREK \n12  IVERSON, CHRISTOPHER WEARE, and  MELISSA BOYD seek to represent a damages class \n13  consisting oft he 71 people who were arrested while bicycling on August 15,2000, including the women \n14  members ofthat group who were twice subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches. \n15  10.  The plaintiffs and each of the 71  people they seek to represent were each \n16  discriminated against because they were, or were perceived to be, members of a group engaged in a \n17  political demonstration. \n18 \n19  Defendants \n20  II.  The true names ofd efendants Does 1 through 100 are not now known to plaintiffs \n21  who therefore sue such defendants by fictitious names; but upon ascertaining the true name of a Doe \n22  defendant, plaintiffs will seek leave to allege such true name in place of a fictitious name. \n23  12.  At all times material herein, defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES was a \n24. public entity organized and existing as such under the laws of the State of California.  Defendant \nj. \n25),  COUNTY is responsible for the actions, omissions, policies, procedures, practices and customs of its \n\" \n26::  agents, employees and officials and has the duty to fund and provide the training for and the operations \n1 \n27,;  of its jails, and to pay judgments and settlements in lawsuits against said Department. \n[ \n13.  At all times material herein, defendants Sheriff LEE BACA, and DOES 1 to 10 \n7 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n\n•  • \nI  were policy-making officials of and for the County of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Sheriff \n2  Department. They have the authority and duty to allocate and expend public monies for the operations \n3  of the jails and to pay judgments and settlements arising out of lawsuits based upon unlawful acts or \n4  omissions occurring in defendants' jails.  They have the further duty to train their employees and to \n5  make policies consistent with the constitution and laws to avoid violations thereof and the consequent \n6  waste of taxpayer dollars. \n7  14.  At all times material herein, defendant Sheriff LEE BACA was the Sheriff of Los \n8  Angeles County and, as such, is responsible for, and liable for, all acts in the course and scope of \n9  employment of all his deputies. \n10  15.  At all times herein mentioned, defendants JONES, BROWN and REBECCA \n11  COCOVA  , and DOES 11 to 50 were officials, deputy sheriffs, or other jail workers or employees, \n12  employed as such by defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES and at all times herein mentioned, were \n13  each acting within the course and scope of their employment and under color of law and as a deputy of \n14  defendant Sheriff LEE BACA.  Defendants COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES,  LEE BACA, JONES, \n15  BROWN, REBECCA COCOVA and DOES I through 50 are hereafter referred to collectively as \"the \n16  County defendants.\" \n17  16.  At all  times material  herein,  defendant  CITY OF  LOS  ANGELES  was a \n18  municipality organized and existing as such under the laws of the State of California.  Defendant City \n19  is responsible for the actions, omissions, policies, procedures, practices and customs of its various agents \n20  and agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department (\"LAPD\") and its agents and employees. \n21  17.  At all times material herein, defendants Chief BERNARD PARKS, Commander \n22  THOMAS LORENZEN,  and Does 51 through 60 were policy-making officials of the City of Los \n23  Angeles and the Los Angeles Police Department acting within the course and scope oft heir employment \n24  and under color of state law.

JOHNSON #26312, and OFFICER LEE and DOES 60 through 100 are hereafter referred \n5  to collectively as \"the City defendants.\" \n6  19.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that at all times material herein, each defendant \n7  was acting as the employee, agent, representative and officer of every other defendant, within the course \n8  and scope of such employment and agency, and under color of state law; and that each defendant herein \n9  is in some manner responsible for the injuries and damages herein complained of.  All acts and \n10  omissions alleged herein were performed by and attributable to all defendants, each acting as agent, \n11  employee or under the direction and control of the others; and each defendant instigated, participated \n12  in, approved and/or ratified the acts and omissions of other defendants complained of herein. \n13 \n14  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n15  20.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of all other \n16  persons similarly situated pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §382, and City a/San Jose v. Superior \n17  Court, 12 Cal.3d 447, 115 Cal.Rptr. 797 (1974).  The class is defined as those 71 people who were \n18  arrested in a mass arrest on August 15,2000 while riding bicycles in the City of Los Angeles, and \n19  includes a sub-class of23 women.  The class is so numerous and dispersed that joinder of all members \n20  is impracticable. Some members oft he class live in Los Angeles County but other members oft he class \n21  live elsewhere in California or in other states and at least four members of the class, including two \n22  women, reside in foreign countries. There are questions of law or fact common to the class.  Plaintiffs \n23  are informed and believe and thereon allege that the common questions of fact and law include the \n24, following: \n251  As to the Searches of the Women Plaintiffs and Sub-class Members: Each oft he women \n~ \n26[  plaintiffs and sub-class members was subjected to a strip search and a visual body cavity search shortly \n1 \n27[  after she arrived at the Los Angeles County jail.  None of the men were subjected to such strip search \n! \n28; or visual body cavity search.  Each of the women plaintiffs and sub-class members was subjected to a \n~ \n9 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n\n•  • \nI  second strip search and a second visual body cavity search at the Los Angeles County jail after they had \n2  been ordered released from custody. None oft he men were subjected to such strip search or visual body \n3  cavity search.  Common questions oflaw and fact include whether or not each of those searches was \n4  reasonable, and/or lawful, and/or violated state law and/or was discriminatory. \n5  As to the Arrest. Charges and Custody: Each of the plaintiffs and class members was arrested \n6  without a warrant at the same time and place and in the same circumstances and on the same charges and \n7  each was later charged with the same offenses which did not include the arrest offense.  Common \n8  questions of fact and law include whether or not there was probable cause for those arrests, or for the \n, \n9  charges on which they were arrested or for the charges filed against them.  Additional common issues \n10  of fact and law include the reasonableness of the manner of the arrest, which was common to all \n11  plaintiffs and class members; the propriety of imprisoning plaintiffs and class members until the \n12  arraignment which took place more than 24 hours after they had been arrested; whether and/or to what \n13  extent and how long the County of Los Angeles could lawfully imprison plaintiffs and class members \n14  after all charges had been dismissed. \n15  21.  The  claims  of the  representative  plaintiffs  are  typical  of the  class.  ,Each \n16  representative plaintiff was arrested by the LAPD in the same circumstances as the class, each was \n17  detained in the same circumstances as the class, and each was over-detained by the County of Los \n18  Angeles in the same manner and in the same circumstances as the rest oft he class. Each female plaintiff \n19  was strip searched twice and subjected to two visual body cavity searches in the same manner and in the \n20  same circumstances as each of the female members of the class.  The claims of the representative \n21  plaintiffs are based upon the same legal theories as the claims oft he class members. Each representative \n22  class member suffered actual damages to himself or herself as a result of his or her arrest, detention, \n23  over-detention, and, in the case oft he women members oft he class, strip searches and visual body cavity \n24  searches.  The actual damages suffered by each representative plaintiff are similar in type and amount \n25  to the actual damages suffered by each class member of the same gender. \n26'  22. The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests oft he class. \n271 The interests of the representative plaintiffs are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of \n28: the class. \n10 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n\n•  • \n1  23.  Prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n2  risk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would \n3  establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class. \n4  24. Prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n5  risk of adjudications with respect to individual members ofthe class which would, as a practical matter, \n6  substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class or their ability to protect \n7  their interests. \n8  25. The questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over \n9  any questions affecting only individual members. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege \n10  that all the facts and circumstances relating to the matters complained of in this complaint are materially \n11  identical for each class member and therefore predominate over any individual questions.  Those \n12  questions oflaw and/or fact which predominate over any question affecting only individual members \n13  include, but are not limited to: Whether and under what circumstances people who are taken in custody \n14  to the Los Angeles County Jail may be subjected to a strip and visual body cavity search prior to \n15  arraignment; whether and under what circumstances people in the custody of defendant County of Los \n16  Angeles who have been ordered released from custody and are entitled to their freedom may be \n17  subjected to a strip and/or a visual body cavity search; the manner in which strip and visual body cavity \n18  searches are conducted and the lawfulness of that conduct; whether the strip searches and visual body \n19  cavity searches of the women violated their rights under the California Constitution, Article 1, §§ 1 \n20  and13 and their right to equal protection under the California Constitution, Article 1, §7; whether the \n21  detention, arrest, and imprisonment of plaintiffs violated their right to free speech under the California \n22  Constitution, Article 1, §2, were made without probable cause, or were otherwise unlawful under the \n23  laws oft he State of California, including Article 1, § 13 oft he California Constitution; including holding \n24 I  plaintiffs in custody atthe scene oft heir arrests without taking them to a facility for several hours, failing \n25) to provide telephone calls as required by statute, failing to cite and release plaintiffs, and failing to \n., \n( \n26~ release them on their own recognizance; the lawfulness of the jail conditions including the lack of \nI \n27 ( appropriate food, and whether, or under what circumstances, the defendants are permitted to imprison \n~ \n28; persons after any and all legal justification for such imprisonment has expired. \nJ \nE  11 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n\n•  • \n1  26.  Class  action is  superior to  other available methods for the fair  and efficient \n2  adjudication of the controversy between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon \n3  allege that the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate \n4  action is low, in that many class members would be unable to individually prosecute any action at all. \n5  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because \n6  all of the claims arise in the same location, i.e., the County of Los Angeles, and it will promote judicial \n7  efficiency to resolve the common questions oflaw and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts. \n8  Plaintiffs know the identities of most of the class members.  The identities of the unknown class \n9  members may be ascertained from LAPD and COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES records. \n10  27.  Class members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the \n11  circumstances, including individual notice to all members. Plaintiffs are aware of the addresses of the \n12  majority of the class members and are informed and believe that LAPD and COUNTY OF LOS \n13  ANGELES records contain a last known address and identifying information for all class members. \n14  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice be given to class members at such last known address by \n15  first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice inform class members of the following: the \n16  pendency ofthe class action, and the issues common to the class; the nature of the action; their right to \n17  'opt out' of the action within a given time, in which event they will not be bound by a decision rendered \n18  in the class action; their right, if they do not' opt out,' to be represented by their own counsel and enter \n19  an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be represented by the named plaintiffs and their counsel; \n20  and their right, ifthey do not' opt out,' to share in any recovery in favor of the class, and conversely to \n21  be bound by any judgment on the common issues, adverse to the class. \n22 \n23  INCORPORATION \n28.

Section 526a. Taxpayers' Claim for Injunction \n7  29.  By this cause of action, plaintiffs seek only to prevent the continued wrongful \n8  expenditure oftaxpayer funds by defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES and do not seek to make any \n9  public employee liable for any injury. On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that defendants LEE \n10  BACA and DOES 1 through 10 each individually made, instigated, participated in, ratified, encouraged \n11  and executed the policies and practices sought to be enjoined. \n12  30.  Defendants' expenditure of taxpayers' funds necessitated by the implementation of \n13  the policies and practices challenged herein is unlawful.  Plaintiffs JULIET MUSSO, SUSANNE \n14  BLOSSOM, RON MILAM, DEREK IVERSON and CHRISTOPHER WEARE have an interest in \n15  enjoining the continued unlawful expenditure of tax funds. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §526a, \n16  plaintiffs seek extraordinary and injunctive relief to prevent continued harm to themselves and to the \n17  public by defendants' use of public monies to carry on the following unlawful policies and practices: \n18  31.  Defendants BACA, and DOES 1 to 10 maintain a blanket policy of ordering, \n19  permitting, authorizing, and encouraging their deputy sheriffs to perform strip searches and visual body \n20  cavity searches and other intrusive searches upon arrestees, and a practice and custom of conducting \n21  such searches in an unreasonable and unlawful manner, and disproportionately upon women in their \n22  custody, without probable cause orreasonable suspicion thatthey are concealing contraband or weapons, \n23  thereby violating the proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures in Article I, Section 7 of \n24 (.  the California Constitution, and violating a woman's right to equal protection of the laws contained in \n25l Article I, Section 13 of the California Constitution. Said defendants maintain their policy, practice and \n~ \n26::  custom notwithstanding that it violates Penal Code §4030 et seq. which makes such conduct a crime; \n1 \n271c  and further, defendants BACA, and DOES 1 to 10 have a policy and practice ofratif)ring such unlawful \n~,  \ni \n28  conduct. \ni \n13 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n\n•  • \n1  32.  On infonnation and belief, plaintiffs allege that deputy sheriffs of defendant \n2  COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES expend at least 16,000 hours of their time per annum in conducting \n3  unlawful strip and visual body cavity searches at an annual cost to the taxpayers ofd efendant COUNTY \n4  OF LOS ANGELES of more than $300,000 in payroll expense and an amount to be proved in payment \n5  ofj udgments and settlements arising from their unlawful conduct. \n6  33.  As a result of its foregoing policies, practices and customs, the taxpayers of \n7  defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES have paid, and will in the future be required to use public \n8  funds to pay wages and salaries, including overtime wages, to deputy sheriffs for conducting such \n9  searches, in the amounts set out above; and further, said taxpayers have paid and will in the future be \n10  required to pay damages to the victims of such unlawful conduct. \n11  34.  If defendants are not enjoined, a multiplicity of lawsuits will be required in that \n12  defendants' unlawful conduct, policies and practices are continuous and ongoing and the taxpayers of \n13  the COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES will be required to continue paying damages to the victims of said \n14  policies and practices, and wages to the deputy sheriffs who are executing the policies and practices. \n15  A continuation of defendants' conduct will produce great and irreparable injury to plaintiffs and to the \n16  public. \n17  35. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law in that money damages will not adequately \n18  compensate plaintiffs or the public for the expenditure of public monies required by the defendants' \n19  deprivation and denial of constitutional and other civil rights and liberties. \n20  36.  Plaintiffs, in order to prevent further waste of public monies, are entitled to \n21  pennanent injunctive relief against defendants BACA, and DOES 1 to 10 pursuant to the provisions of \n22  § 526a of the California Code of Civil Procedure restraining and enjoining defendants BACA, and \n23  DOES 1 to 10 and their successors, agents, employees and all persons acting in concert and participating \n24  with them from enforcing and implementing their unconstitutional and unlawful blanket policy and \n(. \n25 J practice of conducting strip searches and visual body cavity searches and from perfonning strip searches \n,. \n26' and visual body cavity searches in violation of Penal Code §4030, and disproportionately on women, \n27  and in an unlawful manner. \n28 \n,~ \n14 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n\n--............ \n.... \n----------------~ \n•  • \n1  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n2  All Plaintiffs and Class Members vs. defendants CITY \n3  OF LOS ANGELES, BERNARD PARKS, THOMAS \n4  LORENZEN and DOES 51 -60 \n5  Civil Code Sections 51.7, 52, and 52.1 \n6  37.
