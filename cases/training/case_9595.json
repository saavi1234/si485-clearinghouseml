    "summary": "<p>On January 22, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a police officer, the Chief of Police, and the City of Zebulon in the United States District Court in the Northern District of Georgia.  Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, each claimed Defendant officer subjected them to a strip search and body cavity search in violation of the Fourth Amendment and searched them in an abusive and unreasonable manner.</p><p>According to the 11th Circuit Court Opinion, 407 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir. 2005), Defendant arrested Plaintiffs for non-drug crimes following a traffic stop on January 22, 1999.  Defendant arrested the driver for speeding and refusing to take a Breathalyzer and arrested the passenger for an outstanding warrant.  Defendant searched Plaintiffs' pockets and the car at the traffic stop.  Defendant claimed he found a beer bottle cap in the driver's pocket and an open container of alcohol in the car, but Defendant did not show these items to his camera and Plaintiffs denied that Defendant found them.</p><p>While Defendant drove Plaintiffs to the jail, he told them he was the judge and jury in Zebulon and he would \"send you (n-word) away for a long time.\"  Defendant patted Plaintiffs down before entering the jail.  The jailer concluded the warrant was not for the passenger, but Defendant refused to release the passenger.  Defendant took the passenger to a supply closet where Defendant used racist language and ordered the passenger to undress, when the passenger refused to remove his underwear, Defendant placed him in a choke hold.  Another officer pushed the driver into the room, hitting the passenger, and causing them both to fall.  When the passenger tried to stand, Defendant hit him with a baton.  Defendant then pulled the passenger's underwear down and used the baton to separate his butt checks and \"stuck [him] in [the] anus.\"  Defendant ordered the driver to remove his clothing and then placed \"the [same] stick in [his] ass\" and used the baton to lift both their testicles.  Defendant did not clean the baton and he told Plaintiffs they would be raped in prison for twenty years.</p><p>On November 20, 2002, the District Court (Judge Jack T. Camp) granted summary judgment for the City of Zebulon and the Chief of Police.  The Court granted summary judgment to the officer on Plaintiffs' false arrest claims, because the Court found that Defendant had probable cause to arrest the driver for speeding and had probable cause to arrest the passenger for a parole violation.  The Court denied the officer's motion for summary judgment for Plaintiffs' claims of unconstitutional search and unconstitutional manner of search because the officer conducted the searches without reasonable suspicion and in an unconstitutionally intrusive manner. </p><p>Defendant officer appealed the Court's partial denial of summary judgment.  Plaintiffs appealed summary judgment for the City of Zebulon and the Chief of Police.  </p><p>On February 6, 2003, the 11th Circuit dismissed Plaintiffs' appeal because the Court had no appellate jurisdiction due to a lack of finality.</p><p>On November 18, 2003, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges R. Lanier Anderson III, Stanley F. Birch, Jr. and Robert B. Propst) found that Defendant was entitled to summary judgment.  Evans v. City of Zebulon, 351 F.3d 485 (11th Cir. 2003).  The Court held: (1) Defendant had no reasonable suspicion that Plaintiffs concealed drugs to justify strip search and body cavity searches of Plaintiffs.  (2) However, Defendant was entitled to qualified immunity as to the searches, because the law in 1999 was not clear that the strip searches were unconstitutional.  (3) Defendant was entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claims about the manner of the searches.  Although Defendant searched Plaintiffs in an unsanitary, \"degrading,\" \"humiliating,\" and \"terrifying,\" fashion, no similar precedents gave Defendant fair warning that the manner of search was unjustified.  Judge Propst concurred in part and dissented in part and wrote that Defendant should not have qualified immunity as to the manner of the search because Defendant's conduct was so egregious.</p><p>On March 31, 2004, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (Chief Judge James Larry Edmondson and Judges Gerald B. Tjoflat, Anderson, Birch, Joel F. Dubina, Susan H. Black, Edward E. Carnes, Rosemary Barkett, Frank M. Hull, Stanley Marcus, Charles R. Wilson, and William H. Pryor, Jr.) vacated the prior decision of the 11th Circuit (Evans v. City of Zebulon, 351 F.3d 485 (11th Cir. 2003)) and decided to rehear the case en banc.  Evans v. City of Zebulon, 364 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2004).</p><p>Prior to rehearing, Plaintiffs moved to disqualify Circuit Court Judge Pryor.  On October 14, 2004, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (Chief Judge Edmondson) held that Judge Pryor's recess appointment was valid.  Judges Barkett and Wilson dissented.  Evans v. Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2004). </p><p>On January 10, 2005 the U.S. Supreme Court denied petitioners' motion to expedite consideration of the petition for writ of certiorari.  Evans v. Stephens, 543 U.S. 1047 (2005).</p><p>On March 21, 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court (Justice John P. Stevens) wrote that the court's decision to deny certiorari was not a decision that the President's recess appointment of Judge Pryor was constitutional.  Evans v. Stephens, 544 U.S. 942 (2005). </p><p>On May 9, 2005, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Edmondson, Tjoflat, Anderson, Birch, Dubina, Black, Carnes, Barkett, Hull, Marcus, Wilson, and Pryor) on rehearing en banc, affirmed in part but reversed summary judgment for Defendant.  The Court held: (1) Defendant violated Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights by strip searching them after arresting them without reasonable suspicion that Plaintiffs concealed drugs.  Defendant had already searched their car, patted them down, and searched their pockets.  (2) The totality of the alleged manner in which Defendant conducted the searches violated Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights because Defendant used unnecessary force, anal penetration, and terrifying language.  Defendant did not sanitize the baton and searched Plaintiffs without privacy.  (3) Defendant was immune from challenges to his decision to conduct the search because case law did not give Defendant fair notice.  (4) Defendant was not immune from challenges to the manner of search because no reasonable officer could believe the manner of search was reasonable.  Circuit Judges Carnes, Dubina and Hull wrote a concurring opinion.  Circuit Judge Barkett concurred in part and dissented in part.  Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir. 2005).</p><p>On August 31, 2005, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.  Evans v. City of Zebulon, 163 Fed.Appx. 850 (11th Cir. 2005). </p><p>On January 4, 2006, the parties reached a settlement agreement for Defendants Police Officer, Chief of Police, City of Zebulon, Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc., and Georgia Interlocal Risk Management Agency to pay plaintiffs $300,000.  Defendants also paid mediation costs but did not pay plaintiffs' attorneys fees.  On February 24, 2006, Judge Camp dismissed the case.</p><p>Docket: 3:01-cv-00009-JTC</p><p></p>",

Wolfish and Justice v. City of\nI\nPeachtree City, infra, provided \"fair warning\" to Officer Stephens that an abusive\nI strip search would not be condoned. Although neither the United States Supreme\nCourt nor this Court have defined the term \"abusive fashion\" this Court may have\nI\nquestions regarding the measures a police officer may take before crossing over the\nI\nline of abusiveness while conducting a strip search of a motorist and his passenger\nI\naccused of non-violent and non-drug related criminal activity.\nI The Bell balancing test and this Court's application of the test in Justice\ndemands that police officers recognize every citizen's right to privacy. In order to\nI\nencroach upon this privacy right police must have some justification based on a\nI\nparticularized and objective basis in fact giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that\nI\nthe individual is concealing weapons or contraband underneath or within his\nI clothing. Because the Fourth Amendment itself guarantees every citizen the right\nI\n\nI\nI\nto be free from \"unreasonable\" searches, any search based on anything less than\nI\n\"reasonable suspicion\" is by its very definition \"unreasonable\" and a violation of\nI the Fourth Amendment.\nAppellees contend that the facts alleged by Plaintiffs are sufficient to state a\nI\ncause of action of a violation of the Fourth Amendment because the decision to\nI\nstripsearch was unreasonable and the manner in which the strip search was\nI\nconducted was unreasonable.\nI\nFinally, Appellees contend that the involvement in this case by the various '\namici shows the level of interest in the public policy matter and a full hearing\nI\nincluding oral argument is in the best interest of justice.\nI\nI\nI CERTIFICATE OF TYPE SIZE AND STYLE\nI\nThis is to certify that this brief is composed with 14-point type and Times\nI New Roman font.\nI\nI\nI\nii\nI\n\nI\nI\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nI\nCERTIFICATE OF INTERESTED PERSONS ...............................

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\nI\nDefendant/Appellant Denis Stephens [Stephens] appeals the District Court's\nI\ndenial of Summary Judgment based on qualified immunity. The issues Stephens\nI\nraise are whether a constitutional violation occurred and whether the law regarding\nthe specific act of violation was clearly established. These are legal issues\nI\nimmediately appealable. Mitchell v. Fors,cth, 472 U.S. 511,530, 105 S.Ct. 2806\nI\n(1985); Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1484 (11 thCir. 1996).\n!\nH. STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\nI\nIn its order granting en banc review of the panel decision this Court\nrequested the parties to focus their briefs on the following two issues:\nI\n(1) WHETHER ARRESTEES WHO ARE TO BE DETAINED IN\nI THE GENERAL JAIL POPULATION CAN\nCONSTITUTIONALLY BE SUBJECTED TO A STRIP\nSEARCH ONLY IF THE SEARCH IS SUPPORTED BY\ni\nREASONABLE SUSPICION THAT SUCH A SEARCH WILL\nREVEAL WEAPONS OR CONTRABAND.\nI\n(2) WHETHER THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SEARCHES IN\nTHIS CASEWERE CONDUCTED VIOLATED THE\nI\nCLEARLY ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF\nPLAINTIFFS SO THAT OFFICER STEPHENS IS NOT\nI\nENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY.\nPlaintiff/Appellees respectfully request the Court to consider additional\nI\nargument presented herein and by Amicus ACLU which touch upon the Court's\nI\napplication of Hope v. Pelzer to the qualified immunity analysis.\n\n!\nI\nHI. STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nI\nA. Course of Proceedings and Dispositions in the Court Below\nI Plaintiffs/Appellees Evans and Jordan filed their Complaint pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 on January 22, 2001. An Amended Complaint was filed with\nI\nconsent of Defendants on March 29, 2002. [R. 19]\nI\nAll Defendants moved for Summary Judgment.\nI\nThe District Court granted summary judgment to Stephens on Plaintiffs'\nI false arrest claim. The District Court denied Stephens' summary judgment on\nPlaintiffs' Fourth Amendment strip search claims.\nI\nThe District Court granted Summary Judgment to Defendant Robert\nI\nLummus in his official capacity and his individual capacity.\nI\nThe District Court granted the City of Zebulon's motion for summary\njudgment.\nI\nB. Statement of Facts\nI\nOn January 22, 1999 Plaintiffs Peter Evans and Detree Jordan met with a\nI\nmusic producer in a studio in Atlanta, GA to record some music. [R. 43, (Jordan\nI\ndepo 24)] After leaving the music studio, Plaintiffs, who were college students,\nI were attempting to get from Atlanta to.Statesboro, GA to Georgia Southern\nUniversity. [R. 43, (Evans depo 5, 27)] According to Plaintiffs, they got on\nI\nInterstate 85 enroute to Macon, GA and later realized they were heading in the\nI 2\n\nI\nI\nwrong direction. JR. 43, (Jordan depo I0, 24)] Stephens stopped Plaintiffs' car for\nI\nspeeding. [R. 45, (Stephens depo 125, 130-31)] A video camera and recorder in\nStephens' patrol car recorded the entire stop except for periods of time when\nI\nStephens intentionally turned the microphone off. [R. 42, the videotape] and [R.\nI\n45 (Stephens depo 130)] Stephens testified that prior to the video camera being\nI\nactivated, he observed no erratic driving or suspicious behavior inside the car. [R.\n!\n45, (Stephens depo 132-3)] Stephens asked Evans if he had been drinking.\nStephens requested Evans to get out of the car. [R. 42, (JDE 5, 20:02:18)] Stephens\nI\nthoroughly searched Evans, including going into his pockets, and found no\nI\nweapons or contraband. [R. 42, (JDE 5, 20:03:53-20:05:25)]\nI\nPlaintiff Jordan also denied either he or Evans had consumed any alcoholic\nI beverages. [R. 42, (JDE 5, 20:07:29-20:08:28)] Stephens searched Plaintiffs' car\nfor a period of over five minutes, including Evans' book bag. [R. 42, ODE 5,\nI\n20:08:45-20:14:00)] Stephens switched off the microphone of his video recorder,\nI\nand walked out of camera range for a period of over four minutes, leaving\nI\nPlaintiffs sitting on the trunk of their car. [R. 42, (JDE 5, 20:14:10-20:18:18)]\nI When Stephens returned on camera, he arrested Evans for \"DUI refusal,\"\nplaced him in handcuffs behind his back, and advised him of his Miranda rights.\nI\n[R. 42, (JDE 5, 20:23:23-20:24:11)]\nI\n\n!\nI\nStephens then arrested Jordan for \"active warrants.\" [R. 42, (JDE 5,\nI\n20:24:47-20:25:00)] Stephens thoroughly searched Jordan and found no weapons\nor contraband. JR. 42, (J-DE 5, 20:25:05-20:25:48)] Stephens thoroughly searched\nI\nthe passenger compartment two more times, searched the trunk of Plaintiffs' car,\nI\nand searched the area outside of Plaintiffs' car, and found no contraband. [R. 42,\n!\nJDE 5, 20:36:15-20:46:00)]\nI\nStephens transported Plaintiffs to the Pike County Jail. [R. 45, (Stephens\ndepo 14-15)] Upon arriving at the Pike County Jail, Stephens handcuffed both\nI\nEvans and Jordan to a bench outside the jail booking office. [R. 45, (Stephens depo\nI\n18)] Jordan was pi-otesting he was not the parole violator wanted in the active\nI\nwarrant because he had never been arrested and was not on parole. [R. 43,\nI\n(Dawson depo 53)] The on-duty jailer, Pike County Deputy Sheriff Andre Dawson\nsaid he personally attempted to convince Stephens to release Jordan because the\nI\ndescription in the NCIC/GCIC report did not match Jordan's physical description.\nI\n[R. 43, (Dawson depo 53), and R. 42, ODE 7 - GCIC printout)] According to the\nI\nNCIC/GCIC printout, the warrant was outstanding for a man who was 5' 8\" tall,\nl\n135 pounds, with a scar under his left eye. [R. 42, ODE 7 - GCIC printout)] Jordan\nis approximately six feet tall, over 200 pounds, and had no such scar under his left\nI\neye. [R. 43, (Dawson depo 51-54)] Stephens told Dawson, you do your job and let\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nme do mine. [R. 43, (Dawson depo 55)] Stephens ignored the protests of Jordan\nI\nand Dawson, as well as the information on the printout.\nI Stephens claims to have formed a reasonable suspicion that Plaintiffs were\nconcealing drugs underneath their clothing simply because these Plaintiffs, who\n!\nhad been caught speeding, and who were lost at night a good distance from home,\nI\nwere nervous. [R. 45, (Stephens depo 89)]\nI\nStephens and Deputy Sheriff Jeff Oliver took Evans and Jordan from the\n! bench where they were handcuffed into another room of the jail, where they were\nphysically assaulted, battered, humiliated, intimidated, threatened, and called\n!\nniggers. [R. 45, (Stephens depo 78-88); R. 43 (Evans depo 13-17); R. 43, (Jordan\nI\ndepo 12-17)] After physically forcing Plaintiffs to remove their clothing, Stephens\nI\nused a metal object to probe Plaintiffs' genital and anal areas and lift their testicles,\nI and told them to get used to it, because he was going to see to it that they went to\nprison, and they were going to get \"butt fucked\" for twenty years. [R. 43, (Evans\nI\ndepo 13-17); R. 43 (Jordan depo 12-17)] When Evans and Jordan were brought\nI\nback to the bench after the strip search, they outcried to Jailer Dawson about what\nI\nStephens had done to them. JR. 43, (Dawson depo 22-23, 65-67, 70-71)]\nI Jordan was released from the Pike County Jail the following day. [R. 43,\n(Jordan depo 33)] Jordan returned to the Pike County Jail to post Evans' bond. JR.\ni\n43, (Jordan depo 21-22] Stephens met Jordan coming down the hallway and was\nI 5\n\nI\nI\nwaving a bag of marijuana at him claiming that he had found it in the trustee's cell\nI\nand he was going to charge Plaintiffs for selling contraband or distributing drugs in\nI the.jail. [R. 43, (Jordan depo 21-22); R. 43, (Evans depo 20-21); R. 43, (Dawson\ndepo 25-28, 74-79)] Again, Dawson intervened on Jordan's behalf and told\nI\nStephens, \"You do not know if it's their drugs. You don't know how it got there.\nI\nThat room was not searched. You searched these guys. They say you strip searched\nI\nthem. I searched them once even before they went into that room.\" JR. 43,\nI (Dawson depo 27-28)] Plaintiffs were never charged with this marijuana.\nJordan posted Evans' bond on the DUI and speeding charges and the two\nI\nmen left the City ofZebulon. [R. 43, (Evans depo 21-22)]\nI\nIV. STATEMENT OF SCOPE OF REVIEW\nI\nThe Court of Appeals reviews de novo a District Court's disposition of a\nsummary judgment motion. Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188, 1190 (11 thCir. 2002).\nI\nWhen the Court of Appears interlocutorily reviews a legal issue involved in a\nI\ndenial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds, the Court 0f Appeals\nI\ncan simply accept the facts upon which the District Court denied summary\ni\njudgment. Although this Circuit believes it is not required to accept the facts stated\nI in ,.the District Court's order, and this Circuit believes it ,may engage in\ninterlocutory appellate fact finding, Appellees suggest that such fact finding by the\nappellate courts is improper.\n6\n\nI\nI\nAs argued by Professor Brown in his amicus brief i the Supreme Court has\nI\nmade it clear that appellate courts should not review the sufficiency of the\nI plaintiffs' evidence under the guise of qualified immunity on interlocutory appeal.\nJohnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304 (1995) Appellees endorse and adopt the arguments\nI\nmade by Professor Brown including the proper scope of appellate review, and the\nI\nargument against this Circuit's improper interlocutory fact finding in the context of\nI\na qualified immunity analysis.\nI The Court of Appeals is required to resolve all issues of material fact in\nfavor of the plaintiff, because where the issue is evidentiary sufficiency, the\nI\nquestion is \"whether or not certain given facts showed a violation of clearly\nI\nestablished law.\" Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 311, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 2155,\nI\n(1995); Lee v. Ferraro, su__p__,at 1190.\nI When reviewing a District Court's disposition of a summary judgment\nmotion, the Court of Appeals must, as the District Court must, consider \"the\nI\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\nwith the affidavits, if any,\" in the light most favorable to the party opposing the\ni\nI\nsummary judgment motion. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23\n(1986); Skrtich v. Thornton, 280 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11 th Cir. 2002).\nI\nI\n1Professor Brown's Amicus Brief is filed on behalf of the American Civil Liberty Union\norganizations in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.\n7\n\nI\nI\nV. SUIVIMARY OF THE ARGU]VIENT\nI\nThis is an excessive force strip search case where City of Zebulon Police\nI Officer Denis Stephens strip searched Plaintiffs without reasonable suspicion, with\nexcessive force and after Chief 6f Police Lummus had specifically told Stephens\nI\nnot to conduct any strip searches.\nI\nPlaintiff/Appellees argue that reasonable suspicion is the minimumstandard\nI\nconstitutionally permissible to allow police officers or jailers to require an arrestee\nI to submit to a strip search. The very words of the Fourth Amendment protect\ncitizens from unreasonable searches, and unless a strip search is based on a\nI\nreasonable suspicion, then it is per se unreasonable.\nI\nPlaintiff/Appellees also argue that the manner in which the strip searches in\nI\nthis case were conducted violated clearly established law. No reasonable police\nI officer in the circumstances would believe that the actions as described by\nPlaintiffs were constitutionally permissible. Plaintiffs analyze the facts of this case\nI\nin light of this Circuit's analysis in Vineyard v. Wilson, infra, to conclude that\nI\nStephens had fair warning that his actions were unconstitutional.\nI VI. ARGUI_ENT AND CITATION OF AUTIJORITY\nI A. Officer Stephens is not entitled to Qualified Immuni .ty because he did\nnot have discretionary authority to conduct strip searches.\nI\n\nI\nI\nPolice officers are entitled to qualified inmmnity for their official acts only if\nI\nthey act within the scope of their discretionary authority. In Rich v. Dollar, 841\nI F.2d 1558 (11 thCir. 1988) this Circuit derived a tv_.o-part analysis for applying the\nobjective-reasonableness test to a qualified immunity defense:\nI\nThe defendant public official must first prove that \"he was\n.\nI acting within the scope of his discretionary authority when\nthe allegedly wrongful acts occurred.\"\n|\nOnce the defendant public official satisfies his burden of\n,\nmoving forward with the evidence, the burden shifts to the\ni plaintiff to show lack of good faith on the defendant's part.\nThis burden is met by proof demonstrating that the\ndefendant public official's actions \"violated clearly\nI\nestablished constitutional law.\"\nI Rich, 841 F.2d at 1563-64 (quoting Zeigler v. Jackson, 716 F.2d 847, 849 (11 thCir.\n1983). Under the Zeigler/Rich objective reasonableness test, a government official\nI\nproves that he acted within his discretionary authority by showing \"objective\nI\ncircumstances which would compel the conclusion that his actions were\nI\nundertaken pursuant to the performance of his duties and within the scope of his\nI authority.\" Courson v. McMillian, 939 F.2d 1479, 1487 (11 th Cir. 1991)\n(emphasis added).\nI\nStephens contends in his brief to this en banc court that when he conducted\nI\ni\nthe strip searches of plaintiffs he \"was acting consistently with the City of Zebulon.\nI\npolicy that states that a strip search may be conducted if reasonable in light of the\nI\n\nI\nI\ncircumstances.\" [Appellant En Banc Brief page 12] The facts construed most\nI\nfavorably to the Plaintiffs show otherwise. As of January 22, 1999 ChiefLummus\nI had established a no strip search policy for the City of Zebulon Police\nDepartment. Prior to Plaintiffs' arrest and strip search by Stephens on January 22,\nI\n1999, Lummus knew that Zebulon Police Officer Joe Henslee had conducted an\nI\nillegal strip search of a passenger in a car stopped for a minor traffic violation. [R.\nI\n45 (Lummus depo 23-24); R.44 (Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts in Dispute\nI #141 and footnote 13)] Additionally, Lummus knew that Stephens had conducted\nan illegal strip search of a motorist on the side of the road, and he had verbally\nI\nreprimanded Stephens for conducting the 'illegal search. JR. 45 (Lummus depo 37-\nI\n42; 77-78)] Lummus testified that before January 22, 1999, he had verbally\nI\nordered Stephens \"not to be doing any strip searching at all.\" [R. 45 (Lummus\nI depo 38)] Lummus testified further that any strip search at the jail would have been\na violation \"of what I said.\" [R. 45 (Lummus depo 40)] Lummus' testimony of the\nI\nno strip search policy is corroborated by the sworn testimony of Stephens'\nI\nsupervisor, Sgt. Tom Sheppherd, who testified that strip searches were prohibited,\nI\nand that Chief Lummus made that change in policy clear to everyone in the\nI department. [R. 39, Affidavit of Tom Sheppherd] The evidence shows that\nStephens' discretionary authority to conduct strip searches pursuant to the written\nI\nI 10\nI\n\npolicy and procedure manual had been revoked by Chief Lummus prior to January\n22, 1999.\nStephens has not met and cannot possibly meet his threshold burden to be\ngranted qualified immunity, because he had no authority, discretionary or\notherwise, to conduct a strip searchof Plaintiffs at the Pike County Jail. [Stephens'\nactions were clear and indisputable violations of Departmental Policy, and a\nconscious and deliberate violation of a direct order by Chief Lummus personally\ngiven to Stephens prior to January 22, 1999. The prohibition on strip searches was\nwell-settled policy, andwas promulgated directly to Stephens by ChiefLummus in\nSgt. Sheppherd's presence. Therefore, Stephens is not entitled to qualified\nimmunity because he was not acting within the scopeof his discretionary authority\nwhen he strip searchedPlaintiffs atthe Pike County Jail.]\nB. Stephens is not entitled to qualified immunity under Part One of the\nSaucier analysis.\nThe Supreme Court, in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150\nL.Ed.2d 272 (2001), set forth a two-part test to determine whether a police officer\nis entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. As a threshold question, this\nCourt must ask \"taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,\ndo the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?\" Ira\nconstitutional right would have been violated under Plaintiffs' version of the facts,\nI1\n\nI\nI\nthe court must then determine whether the right was clearly established. Saucier,\nI\nId. at 201.\nI The District Court found that Stephens' strip search of Plaintiffs was\nunconstitutional because Stephens lacked reasonable suspicion to justify strip\nI\nsearching Plaintiffs, and because the facts alleged by Plaintiffs, taken as being true,\nI\nestablished that the strip search was conducted in an unreasonable manner. JR. 53,\nI\n10-13] The District Court's decision should be affirmed.\nI The issue this Court requested the parties to focus on was:\nWHETHER ARRESTEES WHO ARE TO BE DETAINED IN THE\nI\nGENERAL JAIL POPULATION CAN CONSTITUTIONALLY BE\nSUBJECTED TO A STRIP SEARCH ONLY IF THE SEARCH IS\nI SUPPORTED BY REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT SUCH A SEARCH\nWILL REVEAL WEAPONS OR CONTRABAND.\nI\nFor the following reasons, the question should be answered in the affirmative.\nI \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated .... \"\nI\nUnited States Constitution, Amendment IV. (emphasis added) Any search not\nI\nbased on at least \"reasonable suspicion\" is by its very nature and definition\nI\n\"unreasonable.\" Every police officer knows that an \"unreasonable\" search of any\nI kind is a violation of the Fourth Amendment based on the express words of the\nConstitution. Thus, the Constitution itself gives fair warning to all police officers\nI\nnot to conduct strip searches unless he has \"reasonable suspicion.\" Appellant\n12\n\nI\nI\nStephens concedes in his brief to this en banc Court that he believed the state of the\nI\nlaw at the time of the arrest required an officer to have \"reasonable suspicion\"\nI [Appellant's en banc Brief at page 12] and [R.45 (Stephens deposition page 48:9\nthrough 51:15)]\nI\nThe Supreme Court has held that it is a violation of a person's constitutional\nI\nrights when the government conducts an unreasonable search in a place where one\nI\nhas a reasonable expectation of privacy. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S.I, 9, 88 S.Ct.\nI 1868 (1968). This Circuit has held as axiomatic the principle that people harbor a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in their \"private parts.\" Justice v. City of\nI\nPeachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 191 (11 thCir. 1992). This Court further recognized\nI\nthat \"deeply imbedded in our culture.., is the belief that people have a reasonable\nI\nexpectation not to be unclothed involuntarily, to be observed unclothed, or to have\nI their 'private' parts observed or touched by others.\" Justice, at 191 (emphasis\nadded).\nI\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 560 (1979), created a balancing test to\nI\ndetermine whether the intrusiveness of a strip search meets constitutional muster.\nI\nThe Supreme Court requires the court to balance the interests of the citizen in his\nI privacy against the government's interests. A blanket strip search policy cannot\nadequately balance the interests of every individual who comes before the\nI\ngovernment in the context of a custodial arrest and confinement in a general jail\nI 13\n\nI\nI\npopulation. The first level of defense of an individual's right to privacy is a well-\nI\ntrained and conscientious police officer. Every officer must understand that an\nI order to remove your clothes can be made only after consideration of particularized\nfacts that give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the individual is hiding weapons\nI\nor contraband. When police or jail officials are given unbridled authority based on\nI\nsome unspecified general security interest, then the right of every citizen to be free\nI\nfrom unreasonable searches is violated.\nI This Court acknowledged the paramount nature of the right to be free from\nunreasonable strip searches in Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11 th\nI\nCir. 1992), where a panel of this Circuit restated that \"convicted prisoners [or\nI\npretrial detainees] do not forfeit all constitutional protections by reason of their\nI\n...confinement.\" 961 F.2d at 191. At page 192 the Justice panel interpreted Bell's\nI\nbalancing test as requiring \"at a minimum, that the facts upon which an intrusion\nis based be capable of measurement against an objective standard whether this be\nI\nprobable cause or a less stringent test.\" (emphasis added) It is for the\nI\ncourt...ultimately to resolve whether, under the facts available to a law\nI\nenforcement officer, the legal standard for reasonable suspicion was met.\" 961\nI F.2d at 193. In order for a police officer to sustain his reasonable suspicion he\nmust convince the court that he had a particularized and objective basis to suspect\nI\nthe particular person searched of hiding weapons or contraband. The only way to\nI 14\n\n!\nI\nmeet this challenge is to establish a '+reasonable suspicion\" based on facts known\nI\nto the officer. Anything less is per se unreasonable. Any blanket strip search\nI policy that allows police officers or jail officials to strip search an arrestee without\nany consideration of the particular facts surrounding the arrestees situation violates\nI\nthe holding and the rationale of both Bell and Justice.\n!\nUntil the Supreme Court overrules or modifies the balancing test announced\nI\nin Bel___[la,nd this Court overrules or modifies the Justice balancing test and the\nI standard for justification described as \"reasonable suspicion,\" arrestees can be strip\nsearched _ the search is supported by reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is\nI\nhiding weapons or contraband.\nI\na. Stephens lacked a reasonable suspicion to believe Plaintiffs were\nconcealing drugs under their clothing.\nI\nOf the factors asserted by Stephens in his summary judgment motion, the\nI\nDistrict Court concluded that only three factors related to possible drug use or\nI\npossession: 2 (1) the plaintiffs were nervous, (2) their story was suspicious, and (3)\nI they were driving a rental car. [R. 53 p 12] The District Court properly determined\nthat Stephens' suspicions based on the Plaintiffs' nervousness and their suspicious\nI\nstory were dispelled by Stephens' thorough search of Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs' car,\nI ?\nand the area around their car. [R. 53, 12] During his searches, Stephens found no\nI\nI 15\n\nI\nI\nevidence to support any suspicion that the Plaintiffs were using or carrying illegal\nI\ndrugs. Based on his review of.the factors asserted by Stephens, and after viewing\nI the videotape of the actual stop, the District Court concluded that Stephens did not\nhave a reasonable suspicion to believe Plaintiffs were concealing drugs because\nI\nStephens' suspicions were based on nothing more than a rental car and a \"hunch.\"\nl\n[R. 53, 12]\nI\nThis Court should affirm the District Court's holding that Stephens violated\nI Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights because he did not have a reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that Plaintiffs were concealing drugs under their clothing.\nI\nb. Stephens did not have arguable reasonable suspicion to believe\nI that Plaintiffs were concealing drums under their clothing.\nOn appeal, Stephens presses forward his theory of \"arguable reasonable\nI\nsuspicion\" tojustify granting summary judgment based on qualified immunity.\nI\nThe purpose for the arguable reasonable suspicion theory is to prevent\nI\npersonal liability for police officers who make a reasonable, but mistaken,\n! conclusion that reasonable suspicion exists. Brent v. Ashley, 247 F.3d 1294, 1303\n(11 thCir. 2001 ) (emphasis added)\nI\nIn Justice v. City of Peachtree City, _ at 193, this Circuit made it clear\nI N\nthat in order to conduct a strip search of an arrestee, a police officer must have a\nI\n2Stephens admitted that he never suspected either Evans or Jordan of concealing any weapons\n16\n\nI\nI\n\"particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person searched of\nI\ncriminal activity. ''3 In order for Stephens to prevail on the arguable reasonable\nI suspicion theory, he must show that based on the facts available to Stephens at the\ntime, a reasonable police officer could reasonably conclude the facts were legally\nI\nsufficient to establish reasonable suspicion to justify the strip search, even though\nI\nreasonable suspicion in fact did not exist.\nI\nStephens argues on appeal that many factors support a detemlination that he\nI had arguable reasonable suspicion of illegal drugs. All of the factors listed by\nStephens are clearly recorded on the videotape of the traffic stop. [R. 42 (JDE 5)]\nI\nThe District Court reviewed the videotape of the traffic stop and concluded that\nI\nonly one of the factors listed by Stephens (a rental car) supported his claim of\nI\nreasonable suspicion. The videotape shows the Plaintiffs' appearance and\nI demeanor, records the words they used to explain their \"suspicious story,\" shows\ntheir willingness to be searched, and shows Stephens' thorough searches of\nI\nPlaintiffs, their car, and the area surrounding their car.\nI\nI\nI\nunder their clothing. [R. 45 (Stephens depo, 90-91)]\naStephens admitted that on January 22, 1999 he knew the law in the 11thCircuit required him to\nhave a \"particularized and objective basis\" to suspect an arrestee of hiding contraband. Stephens\nalso knew that the 11thCircuit required a \"reasonable suspicion\" before a strip search could be\nconducted on less than probable cause. [R. 45, (Stephens depo 50-51]\n17\n\nI\ni No reasonable police officer would conclude that the particular facts known\nI to Stephens were sufficient to form a reasonable suspicion. Therefore, Stephens is\ni not entitled to qualified immunity based on arguable reasonable suspicion.\nC. Stephens is not entitled to qualified immunity under Part Two of the\nI Saucier analysis.\ni The second issue this en bane court requested the parties to focus their briefs\non involves the second part of the Saucier test and was presented as:\nI WHETHER THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SEARCHES IN THIS\nCASE WERE CONDUCTED VIOLATED THE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED\nI CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF PLAINTIFFS SO THAT OFFICER\nSTEPHENS IS NOT ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nI For the reasons and argument that follow, this question should also be\nI answered in the affirmative. . .\nI a. Stephens' strip search of Plalntnffs was conducted in an abusive\nfashion in violation of clearly established law.\nI The second part of the Saucier analysis requires the reviewing Court to\nI determine whether the constitutional right violated was clearly established. Lee v.\nFerraro su__qp__,at 1194, 1197. \"The Fourth Amendment's freedom from\nI\nunreasonable searches and seizures encompasses the plain right to be free from the\nI\nuse of excessive force in the course of an arrest.\" Lee v. Ferraro, supra, at 1197\nI\nciting to Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394-95, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104\nL.Ed.2d 443 (1989).\n18\n\nThe facts taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs clearly show that\nStephens used unreasonable and excessive force in conducting the strip search of\nPlaintiffs. Evans and Jordan testified that on the evening of January 22, 1999,\nStephens took both of them to an isolated part of the Pike County Jail. Jordan\ntestified that he was shoved against the wall and told to put his hands against the\nwall. Stephens began poking Jordan in the back of the head while he made\nderogatory remarks to the effect that he didn't like niggers in his town. Stephens\nthreatened Jordan that he would send him to prison for a long time. Stephens\nordered Jordan to remove his shoes, and then ordered him to take off his shirt.\nStephens then ordered Jordan to \"exit your clothes.\" Jordan was required to lower\nhis trousers to his ankles. When Jordan attempted to explain that he was not the\nperson on the warrant, Stephens grabbed Jordan around the throat in a chokehold\nand then shoved him against the wall. When Evans was brought into the room,\nEvans was shoved into Jordan and both young men fell to the floor. Stephens then\nhit Jordan with an object and said, \"I told you to keep your hands against the wall.\"\nStephens then grabbed Evans by the neck and made him stand with his hands\nagainst the wall. Stephens pulled Jordan's underwear down to his ankles. Then\nStephens ordered Evans to lower his underwear to his ankles. While both men\nwere standing with their hands against the wall, Stephens used a long metal object\nto probe their genital and anal areas. Stephens used the object to lift the men's\n19\n\nI\nI\ntesticles and to spread their buttocks. As Stephens was probing them in their anal\nI\narea, he warned them that they better get used to this type of treatment because\nI \"I'm going to send you boys to prison. You are going to get butt-fucked up the\nass.\" After Stephens finished his probing of their genital and anal areas, Plaintiffs\nI\nwere told to hurry up and get dressed. While they were dressing, Plaintiffs were\nI\nkicked and pushed. [R. 43, (Evans depo 13-17); and R. 43, (Jordan depo 12-17)]\nI\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court announced to every law enforcement\nI officer that strip searches performed in an \"abusive fashion.., cannot be\ncondoned.\" 441 U.S. 520, 560 (1979), The Supreme Court notified police officers\nI\nthat strip searches \"must be conducted in a reasonable manner.\" Id__a_t:. 560. The\nI\nfacts described by Plaintiffs constitute a strip search conducted in an abusive\nI\nfashion with a specific intent to control, dominate, humiliate and cause specific\nI injury to Plaintiffs as demonstrated by the vile, abusive, and evil manner in which\nStephens commanded and intimidated Plaintiffs with threats of going to prison\nI\nwhere they would be raped for the next twenty years. This is exactly the kind of\nI\nabusive strip search that in 1979 the Supreme Court announced \"cannot be\nI condoned. \"\nThis Circuit ,recently described the ways in which Plaintiffs can establish\nI\nthat a constitutional right has been clearly established. \"Fair and clear notice to\nI\ngovernment officials is the cornerstone of qualified immunity.\" Vineyard v.\nI 20\n\nI\nI\nWilson, 311 F.3d 1340,1350 (11 th Cir. 2002). As discussed in Vineyard, there are\nI\nmultiple ways to show fair and clear warning to police officers that a right is\nI clearly established. Id___.\n(1) The Words of a Statute or Constitutional provision can give fair\nI\nand clear warning.\nI The Vineyard opinion makes it very clear that the specific words of a statute\nor constitutional provision can establish a citizen's right with obvious clarity, if the\ni\nofficer's conduct is bad enough. In Vineyard, the accused police officer stopped\nI\nhis patrol car on a dark country road, grabbed the arrestee by her hair and arm\nI\n(bruising her arm and her breast), dragged her out of the backseat Of the patrol car\nI while she was handcuffed behind her back, and pepper sprayed her, in order to stop\nthe arrestee from screaming, being obscene, and insulting the officer during the\nI\nride to the jail. Although the District Court granted the arresting officer's motion\nI\nfor summary judgment based on qualified immunity, this Court reversed, finding\nI\nthat the officer had fair and clear notice that the conduct he was alleged to have\ncommitted was unlawful.\nI\nBecause this Court thought the officer's conduct was \"so bad,\" the Court\nI\nalso believed the officer's conduct \"lies so obviously at the very core of what the\nI ..I\nFourth Amendment prohibits that the unlawfulness of the conduct was readily\nI\napparent to [him], notwithstanding the lack of fact-specific case law.\" Vineyard at\nI 21\n\nI\nI\n1355. This Court held that the arresting officer had fair and clear notice that his\n!\nconduct was unlawful, even though there was no pre-existing case law involving\nI materially similar facts. Considering the arresting officer used pepper spray on an\narrestee who was confined in the back seat of the patrol car, and handcuffed behind\nI\nher back, the Court found that no fact-specific precedent case law was needed to\nI\novercome qualified immunity. Under the Court's analysis, Vineyard is an \"obvious\nI\nclarity case\" where the very words of the Fourth Amendment prohibiting\nI \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" are so clear and the conduct is \"so bad,\" that\nthe violation is obvious.\nI\nLike Vineyard, this is an \"obvious clarity case.\" Taking the Plaintiffs'\nI\nversion of the facts, this Court, as it did in Vineyard, can conclude that no pre-\nI\nexisting case is necessary because the peculiar facts of this case are so far beyond\nI the hazy border between excessive force and acceptable force that every\nobjectively reasonable officer in Stephens' situation would have known that he was\nI\nviolating the Constitution even without case law on point.\nI\n(2) Broad statements in case law not tied to specific facts can give fair\nand clear warning.\nI\nThe Vineyard opinion describes the second way in which fair and clear\nI /\nwarning may be given to police officers. \"...if the conduct is not so egregious as\nI\nto violate, for example, the Fourth Amendment on its face, we then turn to case\nI 22\n\nI\nI\nlaw. When looking at case law, some broad statements of principle in case law are\nI\nnot tied to particularized facts and can clearly establish law applicable in the future\nI to different sets of detailed facts.\" Vineyard, supra at 1351. As in the first method\nof giving fair and clear warning, the Court, in conducting its' analysis, looks at the\nI\nlegal principle in relation to the conduct alleged by the plaintiff. Fair and clear\nI\nwarning can be established if the principle is so clear, and the conduct is \"so bad\"\nI\nthat every \"objectively reasonable official facing the circumstances would know\nthat the official's conduct did violate federal law when the official acted.\"\nI\nVineyard, _at 1351.\nI\nThe Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, su_RE_at 560, announced the general\nI\nprinciple that strip searches conducted in an abusive fashion cannot be condoned.\nI\nThe general principal announced gives every citizen the right to be free from\nI abusive strip searches, similar to the right established by the Fourth Amendment to\nbe free from unreasonable searches. Although the Supreme Court in Bell did not\nI\nspecify exactly what acts were prohibited, future reviewing courts are authorized to\nI\nhold that a \"general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\nI\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question, even though 'the\nI very action in question has not previously been held unlawful,'....\" Hope v. Pelzer,\n122 S.Ct. 2508, 2516 (2002); Vineyard v. Wilson, _ at 1352; each quoting\nI\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987). This is another way of saying\n! 23\nI\n\nI\nI\nthat in an \"obvious clarity\" case, the protected right can be clearly established by\nI\njudge-made words as well as words set forth in the Constitution or a federal statute.\nI Therefore, if this Court finds the manner in which Stephens conducted the strip\nsearch was abusive, the general principle in Bel___c!aln be used to satisfy the second\nI\npart of the Saucier analysis, which requires the right to be clearly established.\nI\nThe Supreme Court in Hope v. Pelzer explained that this Court's \"rigid,\nI\noverreliance on factualsimilarity\" was dangerous. Id___a_t. 2517. In Ho_9_p_,the\nI Supreme Court reversed this Court's affirmation of the granting of summary\njudgment to the prison guards who handcuffed the plaintiff to a hitching post even\nI\nwithout factually-particularized, pre-existing case law. The Supreme Court\nI\nexplained that Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5m Cir. 1974) had established the\nI\ngeneral legal principle that certain forms of corporal punishment would violate the\ni Eight. Amendment. _ at 2516-17. Without specifying the exact type of\nprohibited punishment, Gates provided fair and clear notice to the prison guards in\nI\nthat their actions were unlawful.\nI\nLike Hog_p_et.h,is is a case where a general legal principle, without specific\nI\nfactual examples, can give clear and fair Warning. Like the admonition in Gates\nI (that certain forms of corporal punishment violated the Eighth Amendment) relied\non in Hope, the admonition in Bell (that abusive strip searches cannot be\nI\ncondoned) demands that this Court now put that principle to work and hold that\nI 24\n!\n\nI\n1\nL\nI\nq\nStephens' abusive strip search will not be condoned by this Court. This Court\nI\nI\nshould hold in this case that in light of Bel___t.h_e!l,unlawfulness of Stephens' conduct\nI should have bee:n apparent to Stephens.\n(3) Fact Specific precedent cases can l_ive fair and clear warning.\nI\nThis is an excessive force strip search case. A plaintiff in a § 1983 civil\nI\nI\nrights case can overcome the qualified immunity defense if he can show that the\nI\nright being violated was clearly established by fact specific precedent cases. The\nI Fourth Amendment's freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures\nencompasses the plain right to be free from the use of excessive force in the course\nI\nof an arrest. Vineyard v. Wilson, su_Ep_at 1347; and Lee v. Ferraro, suu_p_ at 1197,\nI\neach citing to Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394-95, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871,104\nI\nL.Ed.2d 443 (1989). In Vineyard, this Court recognized that the right to be free\nr\nI from excessive force in the course of an arrest extends to an arrestee, sitting in a\npatrol car with her hands behind her back, on her way to the jail. Clearly, Evans\nI\nI\nand Jordan, who had been arrested and were handcuffed to the bench inside the\nI\njail, had that same Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force while\nI\nin Stephens' custody. In order to determine whether Evans and Jordan's right to be\nI free from excessive force has been clearly established by precedent fact specific\ncase law, the Court must compare the facts of this case against precedent case law\nI\ni\nin excessive force Cases.\nI 25\nI\n\nI\nI\n\"Whether] a specific use of force is excessive turns on factors such as the\nI\nseverity of the crime, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat, and whether\ni\nI the suspect is resisting or fleeing.\" Post v. City. of Fort Lauderdale, 7 F.3d 1552,\n1559 (11 thCir. !993) (citing Graham_ 490 U.S. at 394). The test in excessive force\nI\ncases, as developed through factually particularized precedent cases, requires the\nI\ncourt to examir/e (1) the need for the application of force, (2) the relationship\nI I\nbetween the need and the amount of force used, (3) the extent of the injury\ni\nI\nI inflicted, (4) wh_ther the force used by the officer is reasonably proportionate to\nI\ni\nthe need for such force which is measured by (5) the severity of the crime, (6) the\nI\n1\ndanger to the officer, and (7) the risk of flight. Leslie v. Ingram, 786 F.2d 1533,\nI I\n1536 (11 thCir. 1986) and Graham v. Conner, supra at 396.\nI\nIn excessive force cases, this Court has consistently denied qualified\nI immunity to police officers whose acts were plainly excessive, wholly\ni\nunnecessary, and .grossly disproportionate under Graham. Additionally, this Court\nI\nhas been consistent in denying qualified immunity when the arrestee had been\nI\nsubdued, handcuffed, or confined, and posed no risk of danger or flight. See\n[\nI\ngenerally, Vineyard, su.p_La_P;riester v. City of Rivera Beach, 208 F.3d 919 (11 _\nCir. 2000); Slicker v. Jackson, 215 F.3d 1416 (11 th 'Cir. 2000); Smith v. Mattox,\n.\n127 F.3d 1416 (11!h Cir. 1997) and Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188 (11 thCir. 2002).\nI\nI 26\nI\n\nI\nI\ni\nI\nThis Court recognized that a woman sitting in the back seat of a police patrol\nI, I\ncar, handcuffed!behind her back, had a right to be free from excessive force under\ni\nI the Fourth Amendment. This Court should also recognize that two young men\nI\ni\nsitting handcuffed to a bench in the Pike County Jail also have the right to be free\nI\nI\nI\nfrom excessive force under the Fourth Amendment. No 11th Circuit case in which\nI\nI\ni\nqualified immunity was granted, involved the infliction of severe, and\nI\nI i\ndisproportionate force after the arrest had been fully affected, the arrestee fully\nI\nI secure, and all danger vitiated. The facts of this case are well outside the realm of\ncases in which the 11th Circuit has granted qualified immunity on the ground that\nI\nI\nthe force used and the injury sustained were de minimus. Here the force, threats,\nI\nintimidation, and racial epithets used by Stephens go so far beyond the hazy border\nI\nbetween excessive and acceptable force so that Stephens had to know he was\n! violating the Constitution.\nD. Stephens should not be granted qualified immunity based on the\nI\nPlaintiffs' alleged resistance.\nI Appellant argues in his brief to this en banc court that Stephens' use of force\nwas justified because Plaintiffs were not \"complying with his directions.\"\nI\n[Appellant's En Banc Brief page 20] Additionally, the panel reviewing the District\nI\nCourt's ruling gave Stephens the benefit of the doubt and held that Plaintiffs'\nI\nresistance justified the use of force.\nI\nI\nI\n27\nI\n\nThis en b,anc panel of judges cannot, as a matter of law, give Stephens the\nL\nbenefit of a favorable inference in a summary judgment motion. Plaintiffs are\nentitled to all fa_,orable inferences pursuant'to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.\ni\nStephens testified under oath that he ordered both plaintiffs to remove their\nI\nclothing so he could observe them from both the front and back. According to\ni\nStephens' sworn testimony, both Plaintiffs complied and offered no resistance\ni\nwhatsoever. [R. 45, (Stephens depo 78-86)] Stephens unequivocally denies he used\nI\nL\nI\nany force whatsoever to compel obedience. Stephens denies using any racial\ni\nepithets, hitting 6r choking either Plaintiff, or intimidating them with the threat of\nprison rape. Stephens denies using any object to spread Plaintiffs' buttocks or to\nlift their testicles 'so he could see if they were concealing drugs or contraband. [R.\n[\n45, (Stephens depo 78-88)] Therefore, it is absurd for Stephens to argue to this\ncourt that if any force was necessary to compel obedience, such force was justified\nbecause of Plaintiffs' resistance. It would be even more absurd for this Court to\nE\naccept.such an argument in the face of Stephens' sworn testimony that is\ndiametrically opposed to the story told by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' description of the\nevents of January 22, 1999 is equivalent to a sexual assault and battery in which\nthey were humiliated, dominated and controlled by Stephens w.ith such violence\nand such malice and oppression to conjure up images of Bull Conner. It is\ninconceivable that i_ a summary judgment setting, where Plaintiffs are supposed to\n28\n\nI\nI\ni\nbe given the benefit of every reasonable inference, that the story told by Plaintiffs\ni\nI\nleads any judge on this panel to conclude that Stephens' actions and words were\ni\nt\nI justified. The panel who gave Stephens credit for the reasonable use of force\nh\nshould be asham_ed of themselves.\nI\nStephens 'would have this en banc Court ignore his sworn testimony and give\nI i\nhim the benefit of a favorable inference that his use of force was justified.\nI\nHistorically, this Court would scrutinize the facts of each case in order to find a\nI reason to grant immunity to a police officer because no other police officer had\nI\nI\npreviously committed a constitutional violation in exactly the same manner. As\nI\nProfessor Brown's amicus brief discusses, \"interlocutory appellate review is not\nI I\ni\nthe proper time for drawing conclusions about the reasonableness of a police\nI\nofficer's force.\" This Court should not, and cannot, as a matter of law, give the\nI moving party the benefit of the doubt. All reasonable inferences must be construed\nin Plaintiffs' favoi', not in Stephens' favor. Whether Stephens used any forde, and\nI\nI\nwhether the use of force was reasonable, should be left for the determination of a\nI\njury who are charged to judge the credibility of the witnesses. This Court should\nI\naffirm the trial court's ruling that a genuine issue of material fact prohibits the\nI granting of qualified immunity to Stephens.\nEo Stephens should not be granted qualified immunity based on the lack of\nI\npermanent physical injury to Plaintiffs.\nI 29\nI\n\nI\nI\nAt oral argument, the panel asked Plaintiffs' counsel to address whether a\nI\nI\nPlaintiff can recover for a constitutional violation if there were no injuries to\nI Plaintiff. This Court can review the record and conclude that there were physical\ninjuries to Plaintiffs although there were no permanent injuries.\nI\n1\nEven without physical injury, a plaintiff can recover for personal\nI i\nhumiliation, embarrassment, and mental distress as a result of a deprivation of\nI\nconstitutional rights in a §1983 case. Baskin v. Parker, 602 F.2d 1205 (5th Cir.\nI 1979).\nVII. CONCLUSION\nI\nBased on the foregoing argument and authority, this Court should affirm the\nI\nruling of the District Court denying summary judgment to Stephens on the basis of\nI\nI\nqualified immuni6y.\nI Defendant/Appellant and Amici supporting him urge this Court to issue a\nI\nruling in this case that authorizes blanket strip searches at jail facilities.

Oral\nargument in this case might be appropriate to allow the Court to address any\nI\nquestions concerning the evidence of this police officer's discretionary\nI\nauthority. The Etcts concerning the strip search as alleged by the plaintiffs\nI\nand the police officer are widely disparate. The issue to be determined by\nthis Court will be whether qualified immunity is appropriate to a police\nI\nofficer who conducts a body cavity strip search in an abusive fashion after\nI\nhis Chief of Police had told him not to conduct any-strip searches. Although\nI\nneither the United States Supreme Court nor this Court have defined the\nI tenn \"abusive fashion\" this Court may have questions regarding the\nmeasures a police officer may take before crossing over the line of\nI\nabusiveness while conducting a strip search of a motorist arrested for a\nI\nminor traffic violation.\nI\nI\nCERTIFICATE OF TYPE SIZE AND STYLE\nI\nThis is to certify that this brief is composed with 14-point type and\nI\nTimes New Roman font.\nI\n±\n\nI\nI\n\"FABLE OF CONTENTS\nI\nCERTIFICATE OF INTERESTED PERSONS ...............................

STATEMENT O17 JURISDICTION\nI\nDefendant/Appellant Denis Stephens [Stephens] appeals the District Court's\nI denial of Summary Judgment based on qualified ilmnunity. The issues Stephens\nraise are whether a constitutional violation occtLrred and whether the law regarding\nI\nthe specific act of violation was clearly established. These are legal issues\nI\nimmediately appealable. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806\nI\n(1985); Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1484 (11 th Cir. 1996).\nII. STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\nI\nWhether Stephens' discretionary authority to conduct strip searches had\nI\nbeen revoked by Chief Lummus' verbal standing order.\nI\nWhether Stephens had a reasonable suspicion or an arguable reasonable\nI suspicion to believe that Plaintiffs/Appellees Peter Evans and Detree Jordan\n[Evans and Jordan] were concealing drugs.\nI\nWhether, assuming Plaintiffs' version of the facts, the strip search, or the\nI\nmanner in which Stephens conducted the strip search of Evans and Jordan violated\nI\nEvans and Jordan's constitutional rights.\nI Whether Evans and Jordan had a clearly established right to be free from an\nunreasonable strip search and free from the use of excessive force while in the\nI\ncustody of Stephens.\nI\nWhether Stephens is entitled to qualified immunity.\nI 1\n\nI\nI\n111. STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nI A. Course of Proceedings and Dispositions in the Court Below\nPlaintiffs/Appellees Evans and Jordan filed their Complaint pursuant to 42\nI\nU.S.C. § 1983 on January 22, 2001. Discovery proceeded, and near the end of\nI\ndiscovery, Evans and Jordan requested leave of Court to file an Amended\nI\nComplaint by consent of the parties. The Amended Complaint was filed on March\nI 29, 2002. [R. 19]\nAll Defendants moved for Summary Judgment.\nI\nThe District Court granted smmnary judgment to Stephens on Plaintiff's\nI\nfalse arrest claim. The District Court denied Stephens' summary judgment on\nI\nPlaintiffs' Fourth kanendment strip Search claims because Stephens did not have a\nI reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search and, assuming the version of the\nfacts as alleged by Plaintiffs, the strip search was conducted in an unreasonable\nI\nmanner.\nI\nThe District Court granted Summary Judgment to Defendant Robert\nI\nLmnmus in his official capacity and his individual capacity.\nThe District Court granted the City of Zebulon's motion for summary\nI\njudgment based on its finding of insufficient evidence to demonstrate a fact\nI\nquestion as to Lummus' deliberate indifference to constitutional rights.\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nB. Statement of Facts\nI\nOn January 22, 1999 Plaintiffs Peter Evans and Detree Jordan met with a\ninusic producer in a studio in Atlanta, GA to record some music. JR. 43, (Jordan\nI\ndepo 24)] After leaving tile music studio, Plaintiffs, who were college students,\nI\nwere attempting to get from Atlanta to Statesboro, GA to Georgia Southern\nI\nUniversity. [R. 43, (Evans depo 5, 27)] According to Plaintiffs, they got on\nI\nInterstate 85 enroute to Macon, GA and later realized they were heading in the\nwrong direction. [R. 43, (Jordan depo 10, 24)] Stephens stopped Plaintiffs' car for\nI\nspeeding. [R. 45, (Stephens' depo 125, 130-31)] Stephens' patrol car was equipped\nI\nwith a video cameraand recorder. [R. 45 (Stephens depo 130)] Stephens testified\nI\nthat prior to the video camera being activated, he observed no erratic driving or\nI suspicious behavior inside the car. JR. 45, (Stephens depo 132-3)] Stephens\ntestified he had a \"reasonable hunch\" that the driver could be DUI. JR. 45,\nI\n(Stephens depo 133)] Stephens asked Evans if he had been drinking. Evans said he\nI\nhad not been drinking. [R. 42, (Joint Defense Exhibits (JDE) 5, 20:02:15-16)]\nI\nStephens requested Evans to get out of the car. JR. 42, (JDE 5, 20:02:18)] Stephens\nI thoroughly searched Evans, including going into his pockets, and found no\nweapons or contraband. [R. 42, (JDE 5, 20:03:53-20:05:25)]\nI\nPlaintiff Jordan also denied either he or Evans had consumed any alcoholic\nI\nbeverages. [R. 42, (JDE 5, 20:07:29-20:08:28)] Stephens searched Plaintiffs' car\n3\nI\n\nI\nI\nfor a period of over five minutes, including Evans' book bag. [R. 42, (JDE 5,\nI\n20:08:45-20:14:00)] Stephens testified that it was his normal practice to display\nany open alcohol containers for the video camera for use at trial later and to\nI\nconfiscate the containers as evidence of a crime. [R. 45, (Stephens depo 149-50)]\nI\nDuring the searches of Plaintiffs' car Stephens did not mention or produce for the\nI\nvideotape any contraband or open alcoholic beverage containers. JR. 45, (Stephens\nI\ndepo 149-50)]\nStephens switched off the microphone of his video recorder, and walked out\nI\nof camera range for a period of over four minutes, leaving Plaintiffs sitting on the\nI\ntrunk of their car. [R. 42, ODE 5, 20:14:10-20:i8:18)]\nI\nWhen Stephens returned on camera, he gave Evans a copy of a Uniform\nI Traffic Citation for speeding.

The Court of Appeals may accept the District Court's\nI\nfactual findings, and additionally, may supplement those facts with evidentiary\nI\nsufficiency findings of its own from the record. Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480,\nI 1486 (11 th Cir. 1996).\nThe Court of Appeals also reviews de novo the issue of evidentiary\nI\nsufficiency of the facts that are part and parcel of the core qualified immunity\nI\nanalysis. However, the Court of Appeals is required to resolve all issues of\nI\nmaterial fact in favor of the plaintiff, because where the issue is evidentiary\nI sufficiency, the question is \"whether or not certain given facts showed a violation\nof clearly established law.\" Johnson v.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nI\nThis is an excessive force strip search case where City of Zebulon Police\ni Officer Denis Stepbens strip searched Plaintiffs without reasonable suspicion, with\nexcessive force and after Chief of Police Lummus had specifically told Stephens\nI\nnot to conduct any strip searches.\nI\nAfter considering the District Court's Order, and reviewing de novo the\nI\ntestimony of Chief Lununus and Stephens' supervisor Sgt. Tom Sheppherd, this\nI Court should conclude that Stephens did not have discretionary authority to strip\nsearch Plaintiffs because his discretionary authority had been revoked by Chief\n!\nLumrnus' verbal standing order. Once this Court so finds, then the consideration\nof the qualified immunity issue is over, and the Court should affirm the denial of\nsummary judgment based on qualified immunity.\nIn the event the Court determines that Stephens met his burden of showing\nhe was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority, tiffs Court should\naffirm the District Court's ruling that Stephens violated Plaintiffs' constitutional\nright to be free from unreasonable searches and the use of excessive force.\n10\n\nI\nAssuming Plaintiffs' version of the facts, Stephens clearly violated Plaintiff's\nI Fourth Amendment right by strip searching them without reasonable suspicion or\neven arguable reasonable suspicion to support his \"hunch\" that they were\nI\nconcealing illegal drugs. Additionally, Stephens violated Plaintiffs' constitutional\nI\nright to be free from the use of excessive force by assaulting, battering, shoving,\nchoking, and kicking them, and probing their genital and anal areas with a metal\nI object.\nAs of the date of this strip search, Stephens had fair notice that Plaintiffs'\nI\nrights herein were clearly established. The Fourth Amendment itself, when\nI\nanalyzed in light of Stephens' egregious conduct, gave fair and clear notice to\nI\nStephens that his search and use of force was unlawful. Additionally, Stephens\nhad fair notice from the principle established in Bell v. Wolfish, infra, that abusive\nI\nstrip searches would not be condoned. Finally, Stephens had fair notice from prior\nI\nexcessive force cases, that his use of force was excessive in light of the fact that\nI\nboth men were already under arrest, handcuffed, confined in the Pike County Jail\nI and posed no danger to Stephens and posed no threat of escape.\nVI. ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY\nI\nA. Officer Stephens is not entitled to Qualified Immunity\nI\nPolice officers are entitled to qualified irnmuni/y for their official acts only if\nthey act within the scope of their discretionary authority. \"The Supreme Court\n11\n....... ,,o. .... , . , .- .\" . .. . ....... ..: , , ,\n\ndeveloped an objective-reasonableness test for evaluating actions of a government\nofficial claiming qualified immunity: the official's action must be evaluated\ni\nagainst \"clearly established law,\" consisting of statutory or constitutional rights\nI\nthat a reasonable person should have known.\" Courson v. McMillian, 939 F.2d\nI\n1479, 1487 (11 th Cir. 1991) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102\nI\nS.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), and Rich v. Dollar, 841 F.2d 1558 (11 th Cir.\n1988). In Ricl____th,is Circuit derived a lwo-part analysis for applying the objective-\nreasonableness test to a qualified imJnunity defense:\n1. The defendant public official must first prove that \"he was\nacting within the scope of his discretionary authority when\nthe allegedly wrongful acts occurred.\"\n2. Once tile defendant public official satisfies his burden of\nmoving fonvard with the evidence, the burden shifts to the\nplaintiff to show lack of good faith on the defendant's part.\nThis burden is met by proof demonstrating that the\ndefendant public official's actions \"violated clearly\nestablished constitutional law.\"\nRich, 841 F.2d at 1563-64 (quoting Zeigler v. Jackson, 716 F.2d 847, 849 (11 th Cir.\n1983). Under the Zeigler/Rich objective reasonableness test, a government official\nproves that he acted within his discretionary authority by showing \"objective\ni\ncircumstances which would .compel the conclusion that his actions were\ni\nundertaken pursuant to the performance of his duties and within the scope of his\nI\n./\nauthority. Courson v. McMillian, 939 F.2d 1479, 1487(11 th Cir. 1991) (emphasis\nI\nadded).\n12\n\nThe District Court held that Stephens met his Zeigler/Rich burden because\n\"the Zebulon police department policy manual allows officers to conduct strip\nsearches in certain situations.\" [R.53, p.14-15]\nThe clear evidence in this case, construed in Plaintiffs' favor, compels a\nfinding that before Stephens strip searched these Plaintiffs, Chief Lummus\nsuperceded the strip search policy stated in the policy manual by personally\ninstructing Zebulon police officers, including Stephens, that strip searches were\nprohibited.I [R. 39, Affidavit of Tom Sheppherd]\nThe District Court took for granted that the language stated in the written\npolicy satisfied Stephens' burden, without any apparent consideration of the verbal\nstanding order issued by Lnmmus instructing Stephens not to perform any strip\nsearches. [R. 53, 14-15] This Court must review de novo Chief Lutmnus' and Sgt.\nSheppherd's testimony that establishes Stephens \"knew before he strip searched\nPlaintiffs that his authority to conduct strip searches in connection with the\nperformance of his duties as a Zebulon police officer had been revoked.\n1. Stephens did not have discretionary authority to conduct a strip\nsearch of Plaintiffs.\nAs of January 22, 1999 Chief Lurnmus had established a no strip search\npolicy for the City of Zebulon Police Department. Prior to Plaintiffs' arrest and,\n13\n\nI\nI\nstrip search by Slephens on January 22, 1999, Lummus knew that Zebulon Police\niI Officer Joe Henslee had conducted an illegal strip search of a passenger in a car\nstopped for a minor traffic violation. [R. 45 (Lummus depo 23-24); R.44\nI\n(Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts in Dispute #141 and footnote 13)]\nI\nAdditionally, Lummus knew that Stephens had conducted an illegal strip search of\nI\na motorist on the side of the road, and he had verbally reprimanded Stephens for\nI conducting the illegal search. [R. 45 (Lummus depo 37-42; 77-78)] Lummus\ntestified that before January 22, 1999, he had verbally ordered Stephens \"not to be\nI\ndoing any strip searching at all.\" [R. 45 (Lununus depo 38)] Lummus testified\nI\nfilrther that any strip search at the jail would have been a violation \"of what I said.\"\nI\n[R. 45 (Lummus depo 40)] Lummus' testimony of the no strip search policy is\nI corroborated by the sworn testimony of Stephen's supervisor, Sgt. Tom Sheppherd,\nwho testified that strip searches were prohibited, and that Chief Lulmnus made that\nI\nchange in policy clear to everyone in the department. [R. 39, Affidavit of Tom\nI\nSheppherd]\ni\nThe evidence shows that Stephens' discretionary authority to conduct strip\nsearches pursuant to the written policy and procedure manual had been revoked by\nI\nChief Lummus prior to January 22, 1999.\nI\nStephens denied that ChiefLummus told him not to strip search traffic arrestees.\n[R. 45 (Stephens' depo, p 101)]\n14\n\nI\n.I\nStephens has not met and cannot possibly meet his threshold burden to be\nI granted qualified immnnity, because he had no authority, discretionary or\notherwise, to conduct a strip search of Plaintiffs at the Pike County Jail. Stephens'\nI\nactions were clear and indisputable violations of Departmental Policy, and a\nI\nconscious and deliberate violation of a direct order by Chief Lummus personally\nI\ngiven to Stephens prior to January 22, 1999. The prohibition on strip searches was\nI well-settled policy, and was promulgated directly to Stephens by Chief Lummus in\nSgt. Sheppherd's presence. Therefore, Stephens is not entitled to qualified\nI\nimmunity because he was not acting within the scope of his discretionary authority\nI\nwhen he strip searched Plaintiffs at the Pike County Jail.\nI\n2. Stephens is not entitled to qualified immunity under the Saucier\nanalysis.\nI\nThe Supreme Court, in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150\nI\nL.Ed.2d 272 (2001), set forth a two-part test to determine whether a police officer\nis entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. As a threshold question, this\nI\nCourt must ask \"taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,\nI\ndo the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?\" If a\nI\nconstitutional right would have been violated under plaintiff's version of the facts,\nI the court must then determine whether the right was clearly established. Saucier.\nId__a=t 201.\nI\n15\n\nThe District Court fotmd that Stephens' strip search of Plaintiffs was\nunconstitutional because Stephens lacked a reasonable suspicion to justify strip\nsearching plaintiffs, and because the facts alleged by Plaintiffs, taken as being tnle,\nestablished that the strip search was conducted in an unreasonable manner. JR. 53,\n10-13] For the following reasons, the District Court's decision should be affirmed.\na) The Strip Search violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated .... \"\nUnited States Constitution, Amendment IV.\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence has held that it is a violation of a person's\nconstitutional rights when the government conducts an unreasonable search in a\nplace where one has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Terry v. Ohio, 392\nU.S.1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968). This Circuit has held as axiomatic the principle\nthat people harbor a reasonable expectation of privacy in their \"private parts.\"\nJustice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 191 (11 th Cir. 1992). This Court\nfurther recognized that \"deeply imbedded in our culture.., is the belief that people\nhave a reasonable expectation not to be unclothed involuntarily, to be observed\nunclothed, or to have their 'private' parts observed or touched by others.\"\nJustic_.___aet, 191(emphasis added).\n16\n\nUnder the first part of the Saucier test, Plaintiffs mtlst show that the facts\n1 alleged by them constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment because the strip\nsearch was \"unreasonable.\" Plaintiffs submit that the strip search was\nI\n\"unreasonable\" under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence because (1) Stephens\nI\nlacked reasonable suspicion to believe that Plaintiffs were concealing drugs under\nI\ntheir clothing, (2) Stephens lacked arguable reasonable suspicion to believe\nPlaintiffs were concealing drugs under their clothing, and (3) as discussed in\ncontext of the second part of the Saucier analysis below, Stephens used excessive\nforce in conducting the search.\n(1)Stephens lacked a reasonable suspicion to believe Plaintiffs were\nconcealing drugs under their clothing.\nThe District Court considered the facts proposed by Stepllens to support his\nbelief that Plaintiffs were concealing drugs beneath their clothing, z Of the factors\nasserted by Stephens in his summary judgment motion, the District Court\nconcluded that only three factors related to possible drug use or possession: (1) the\nplaintiffs were nervous, (2) their story was suspicious, and (3) they were driving a\nrental car. [R. 53 p 12] The District Court properly determined that Stephens'\nsuspicions based on the Plaintiffs' nervousness and their suspicious story were\ndispelled by Stephens' thorough search of Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs' car, and the\n17\n,. , ; .,_'_;.'. ;:] . .,. \"'_ , _ ,- _ . • .- , .,\n\nI\n,I\narea around their car. [R. 53, 12] During his searches, Stephens found no evidence\nI to support any suspicion that the Plaintiffs were using or carrying illegal drugs.\nBased on his review of the factors asserted by Stephens, and after viewing the\nI\nvideotape of the actual stop, the District Court concluded that Stephens did not\nI\nhave a reasonable suspicion to believe Plaintiffs were concealing drags because\nI\nStephens' suspicions were based on nothing rnore than a rental car and a \"hunclt.\"\nI [R. 53, 12]\nThis Court should affirm the District Court's holding that Stephens violated\nI\nPlaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights because he did not have a reasonable\nI\nsuspicion to believe that Plaintiffs were concealing drugs tinder their clothing.\nI\n(2)Stephens did not have arguable reasonable suspicion to believe that\nPlaintiffs were concealing dru_s under their clothing.\nI\nOn appeal, Stephens presses forward his theory of \"arguable reasonable\nI\nsuspicion\" to justify granting sulmnary judgment based on qualified immunity.\nStephens advances the theory that if no Court has ruled on a particular set of facts\nI\nas establishing that no reasonable suspicion for a strip search exists, then the police\nofficer should be granted qualified immunity if he had arguable reasonable\nsuspicion.\nI 2 Stephens admitted that he never suspected either Evans or Jordan of concealing\nany weapons tinder their clothing. [R. 45 (Stephens depo, 90-91)]\n18\nI\nI\n\"\":L \"'7\"'\" \" \"',':'\" \"\"\" \"\"\" \"''\"\n\nThe purpose for the arguable reasonable suspicion theory is to prevent\npersonal liability for police officers who make a reasonable, but mistaken,\nconclusion that reasonable suspicion exists. Brent v. Ashley, 247 F.3d 1294, 1303\n(11 th Cir. 2001) (emphasis added)\nIn Justice v. City of Peachtree City, supra at 193, this Circuit made it clear\nI\nthat in order to conduct a strip search of an arrestee, a police officer must have a\nI \"particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person searched of\ncriminal activity. ''3 In order for Stephens to prevail on the arguable reasonable\ni\nsuspicion theory, he must show that based on the facts available to Stephens at the\nI\ntime, a reasonable police officer could reasonably conclude the facts were legally\nI\nsufficient to establish reasonable suspicion to justify tile strip search, even though\nreasonable suspicion in fact did not exist.\nI\nStephens argues on appeal that many factors support a determination that he\nI\nhad arguable reasonable suspicion of illegal drugs. All of the factors listed by\nI\nStephens are clearly recorded on the videotape of the traffic stop. [R. 42 (JDE 5)]\nThe District Court reviewed the videotape of the traffic stop and concluded that\nonly one the factors listed by Stephens [rental car] supported his claim of\n3Stephens admitted that on January 22, 1999 he knew the law in the 11thCircuit\nrequired him to have a \"particularized and objective basis\" to suspect an arrestee of\nhiding contraband. Stephens also \"knew that the 11thCircuit required a \"reasonable\n19\n\nI\ni|\nreasonable suspicion. The videotape shows the Plaintiffs' appearance and\nI demeanor, records the words they used to explain their \"suspicious story,\" shows\ntheir willingness to be searched, and shows Stephens' thorough searches of\nI\nPlaintiffs, their car, and the area surrounding their car. This Court, reviewing de\nI\nnovo the legal sufficiency of the arguable reasonable suspicion claim, is invited to\nI\norder the record sent up and review the videotape for itself.\nI After reviewing the videotape, this Court, as the District Court did, should\nconclude that no reasonable police officer could mistakenly conclude that a rental\nI\ncar would be legally sufficient to form a particularized and objective basis to\nI\nbelieve Plaintiffs were concealing drugs.\nI\nTherefore, Stephens is not entitled to qualified immunity based on arguable\nI reasonable suspicion.\nb) Stephens' strip search of Plaintiffs was conducted in an abusive\nI\nfashion in violation of clearly established law.\nI The second part of the Saucier analysis requires the reviewing Court to\ndetermine whether the constitutional right violated was clearly established. Lee v.\nI\nFerraro_ su____, at 1194, 1197. \"The Fourth Amendment's freedom from\nI\nunreasonable searches and seizures encompasses the plain right to be free from the\nI\nuse of excessive force in the course of an arrest.\" Lee v. Ferraro, su_p__, at 1197\"\nsuspicion\" before a strip search could be conducted on less than probable cause.\n20\n\nciting to Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394-95, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104\nL.Ed.2d 443 (1989).\nThe facts taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs clearly show that\nStephens used unreasonable and excessive force in conducting the strip search of\nPlaintiffs. Evans and Jordan testified that on the evening of January 22, 1999,\nStephens took both of them to an isolated part of the Pike County Jail. Jordan\ntestified that when he was escorted to the room where the strip search was\nconducted, he was shoved against the wall and told to put his hands against the\nwall. Stephens began poking Jordan in the back of the head while he made\nderogatory remarks to the effect that he didn't like niggers in his to_. Stephens\nthreatened Jordan that he would send him to prison for a long time. Stephens\nordered Jordan to remove his shoes, and then ordered him to take off his shirt.\nStephens then ordered Jordan to \"exit your clothes.\" Jordan was required to lower\nhis trousers to his ankles. When Jordan attempted to explain that he was not the\nperson on the warrant, Stephens grabbed Jordan around the throat in a choke hold\nand then shoved him against the wall. When Evans was brought into the room,\nEvans was shoved into Jordan and both young men fell to the floor. Stephens then\nhit Jordan with an object and said, \"I told you to keep your hands against the wall.\"\nStephens then grabbed Evans by the neck and made him stand with his hands\n[R. 45, (Stephens depo 50-51]\n21\n\nagainst lhe wall. Stephens pulled Jordan's underwear down to his ankles. Then\nStephens ordered Evans to lower his underwear to his ankles. While both men\nI\nwere standing with their hands against the wall, Stephens used a long metal object\nI\nto probe their genital and anal areas. Stephens used lhe object to lift the men's\nI\ntesticles and to spread their buttocks. As Stephens was probing them in their anal\nI area, he warned them that they better get used to this type of treatment because\nI \"I'm going to send you boys to prison. You are going to get butt-fi_cked up the\nass.\" After Stephens finished his probing of their genital and anal areas, Plaintiffs\nI\nwere told to hurry up and get dressed. While they were dressing, Plaintiffs were\nI\nkicked and pushed. JR. 43, (Evans depo 13-17); and R. 43, (Jordan depo 12-17)]\nI\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court announced to every law enforcement\nI officer that strip searches performed in an \"abusive fashion.., cannot be\ncondoned.\" 441 U.S. 520, 560 (1979), The Supreme Court notified police officers\nI\nthat strip searches \"must be conducted in a reasonable manner.\" Id__=at 560. The\nI\nfacts described by Plaintiffs constitute a strip search conducted in an abusive\nI\nfashion with a specific intent to control, dominate, humiliate and cause specific\ninjury to Plaintiffs as demonstrated by the vile, abusive, and evil manner in which\nI\nStephens commanded and intimidated Plaintiffs with threats of going to prison\nI\nwhere they would be raped for the next twenty years. This is exactly the kind of\nI\n22\n\nI\n:l\nabusive strip search that in 1979 the Supreme Court announced \"cannot be\nI condoned. \"\nThis Circuit recently described the ways in which Plaintiffs can establish\nI\nthat a constitutional right has been clearly established. \"Fair and clear notice to\nI\ngovernment officials is the cornerstone of qualified immunity.\" Vineyard v.\nI\nWilson, 311 F.3d 1340,1350 (11 th Cir. 2002). As discussed in Vineyard there are\n1 multiple ways to show fair and clear wanting to police officers that a right is\nclearly established. Id.\nI\n(l)The Words of a Statute or Constitutional provision can l_ive fair and\nI clear warnin_o.\nThe Vineyard opinion makes it very clear that the specific words of a statute\nl\nor constitutional provision can establish a citizen's right with obvious clarity, if the\nI\nofficer's conduct is bad enough. In Vineyard, the accused police officer stopped\nI\nhis patrol car on a dark country road, grabbed the arrestee by her hair and arm\nI (bruising her arm and her breast), dragged her out of the backseat of the patrol car\nwhile she was handcuffed behind her back, and pepper sprayed her, in order to stop\nthe arrestee from screaming, being obscene, and insulting the officer during the\nride to the jail. Although the District Court granted the arresting officer's motion\nfor summary judgment based on qualified immunity, this Court reversed, finding-\n23\n\nthat the officer had fair and cleat notice that tile conduct he was alleged to have\ncommitted was tmlawfid.\nBecause this Court thought the officer's conduct was \"so bad,\" the Court\nalso believed the officer's conduct \"lies so obviously at the very core of what the\nFourth Amendment prohibits that the unlawfidness of the conduct was readily\napparent to [him], notwithstm_ding the lack of fact-specific case law.\" Vineyard at\n1355. This Court held that the arresting officer had fair and clear notice that his\nconduct was unlawfid, even though there was no pre-existing case law involving\nmaterially similar facts. Considering the arresting officer used pepper spray on an\narrestee who was confined in the back seat of the patrol car, and handcuffed behind\nher back, the Court found that no fact-specific precedent case law was needed to\novercome qualified ilrununity. Under the Court's analysis, Vineyard is an \"obvious\nclarity case\" where the very words of the Fourth Amendment are so clear and the\nconduct is \"so bad,\" that the violation is obvious.\nLike Vineyard, this is an \"obvious clarity case.\" Taking the Plaintiffs'\nI\nversion of the facts, this Court, as it did in Vineyard, can conclude that no pre-\nexisting case is necessary because the peculiar facts of this case are so far beyond\nI\nthe hazy border between excessive forceand acceptable force that every\nI\nobjectively reasonable officer in Stephens' situation would have known that he was\nI\nviolating the Constitution even without case law on point.\n24\n\n(2) Broad statements in case law not tied to specific facts can I_ive fair\nanti clear warning.\nThe Vineyard opinion describes the second way in which fair and clear\nwarning may be given to police officers. \"...if the conduct is not so egregious as\nto violate, for example, the Fourth Amendment on its face, we then turn to case\nlaw. When looking at case law, some broad statements of principle in case law are\nnot tied to particularized facts and can clearly establish law applicable in the filture\nto different sets of detailed facts.\" Vineyard, _ at 1351. As in the first method\nof giving fair and clear warning, the Court, in conducting its' analysis, looks at the\nlegal principle in relation to the conduct alleged by the plaintiff. Fair and clear\nwanting can be established if the principle is so clear, and the conduct is \"so bad\"\nthat every \"objectively reasonable official facing the circumstances would know\nthat the official's conduct did violate federal law when the official acted.\"\nVineyard, suk_c,_at 1351.\nThe Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, su_Rp_rakt 560, announced the general\nprinciple that strip searches conducted in an abtlsive fashion cannot be condoned.\nThe general principal announced gives every citizen the right to be free from\nabusive strip searches, similar to the right established by the Fourth Amendment to\nbe free from unreasonable searches. Although the Supreme Court in Bell did not\nspecify exactly what acts were prohibited, future reviewing courts are authorized to\n25\n\nI\n,I\nhold that a \"general constitutional rule already identified in tile decisional law may\n!1\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question, even though 'the\nI very action in question has not previously been held unlawful,'....\" Hope v.\nPelzej, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2516 (2002); Vineyard v. Wilson, _ at 1352; each\ni\nquoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987). Therefore, if this Cotwt\ni\nfinds the manner in which Stephens conducted the strip search was abusive, the\n1\ngeneral principle in Bell can be used to satisfy the second part of the Sa___ucier\nanalysis, which requires the right to be clearly established.\nI\nThe words of the general principle, when analyzed in light of conduct that is\n!\n\"so bad\" that every reasonable government official would know that the conduct\nI\nwas obviously unlawful, makes the right clearly established by the general\nI principle. This is another way of saying that in an \"obvious clarity\" case, the\nprotected right can be clearly established by judge-made words as well as words\nI\nset forth in the Constitution or a federal statute.\n!\nThe Supreme Court in Hope v. Pelzer explained that this Court's \"rigid,\noverreliance on factual similarity\" was dangerous. Id. at 2517. In Hoo_p_e_t,he\ni\nI Supreme Court reversed this .Court's affirmation of the granting of summary\njudgment to the prison guards who handcuffed the plaintiff to a hitching post even\nI\nwithout factually-particularized, pre-existing case law. The Supreme Court\nI\nexplained that Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974) had established the\n26\n\nI\nI\ngeneral legal principle that certain forms of corporal punishment would violate the\nI\nEight Amendment. _ at 2516-17. Without specifying the exact type of\nprohibited. fair and clear notice to the prison guards in\nI\nHooe that their actions were unlawfid.\ni\nLike Ho_qp__t,his is a case where a general legal principle, without specific\nI\nfactual examples, can give clear and fair warning. Like the admonition in Gates\nI (that certain forms of corporal punislunent violated the Eighth Amendment) relied\non in Ho_9_p_,the admonition in Bell (that abusive strip searches cannot be\nI\ncondoned) demands that this Court now put that principle to work and hold that\nI\nStephens' abusive strip search will not be condoned by this Court. This Court\nI\nshould hold in this case that in light of Bell, the unlawfidness of Stephens' conduct\nI should have been apparent to Stephens.\n(3) Fact specific precedent eases can give fair and clear warning.\nI\nThis is an excessive force strip search case. A plaintiff in a § 1983 civil\nI\nrights case can overcome the qualified immunity defense if he can show that the\nI\nright being violated was clearly established by fact specific precedent cases. The\nFourth Amendment's freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures\n!\nencompasses the plain right to be free from the use of excessive force in the course\nI\nof an arrest. Vineyard v. Wilson, su_up_ at 1347; and Lee v. Ferraro, _ at 1197,\neach citing to Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394-95, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104\n27\n\nL.Ed.2d 443 (1989). In Vineyard, this Corn1 recognized lhat the right to be free\nfrom excessive force in the course of an arrest extends to an arrestee, sitting in a\npatrol car with her hands behind her back, o11her way to the jail. Clearly, Evans\nand Jordan, who had been arrested and were handcuffed to the bench inside the\njail, had that same Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force while\nin Stephens' custody. In order to determine whether Evans and Jordan's right to be\nfree from excessive force has been clearly established by precedent fact specific\ncase law, the Court must COlnpare the facts of this case against precedent case law\nin excessive force cases.\n\"Whether a specific use of force is excessive turns on factors such as the\nseverity of the crime, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat, and whether\nthe suspect is resisting or fleeing.\" Post v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 7 F.3d 1552,\n1559 (11 th Cir. 1993) (citing Graham, 490 U.S. at 394). To determine whether the\namount of force used by a police officer was proper, a court must ask whether a\nreasonable officer would believe that this level of force is necessary in the situation\nat hand. The test in excessive force cases, as developed through factually\nparticularized precedent cases, requires the court to examine (1) the need for the\napplication of force, (2) the relationship between the need and the amount of force\nused, (3) the extent of the injury inflicted, (4) whether the force used by the officer\nis reasonably proportionate to the need for such force which is measured by (5) the\n28\n\nI\nI\nseverity of the crime, (6) the danger to tile officer, and (7) the risk of flight. Leslie\nI v. Ingrana, 786 F.2d 1533, 1536 (11 th Cir. 1986) and Graham v. Conner, _ at\n396.\nI\nIn excessive force cases, this Court has consistently denied qualified\nI\nilnmunity to police officers whose acts were plainly excessive, wholly\nI\nunnecessary, and grossly disproportionate under Graham Additionally, this Court\nI has beera consistent in denying qualified immunity when the arrestee had been\nsubdued, handcuffed, or confined, and posed no risk of danger or flight. See\nI\ngenerally, Vineyard, _ (arrestee handcuffed and secured in back seat of car);\nI\nPriester v. City of Rivera Beach, 208 F.3d 919 (11 th Cir. 2000) (arrestee subdued\nI\non the ground guarded by a police dog, not a threat, not attempting to resist or\nI flee); Slicker v. Jackson, 215 F.3d 1416 (11 th Cir. 2000) (arrestee handcuffed, not\nstruggling, resisting or fleeing); Smith v. Mattox, 127 F.3d 1416 (11 th Cir. 1997)\nI\n(officer on arrestee's back handcuffing him, arrestee not resisting) and Lee v.\nI\nFerraro, 284 F.3d 1188 (11 thCir. 2002) (arrestee handcuffed and not resisting).\nI\nThis Court recognized that a woman sitting, handcuffed behind her back, in\nthe back seat of a police patrol car had a right to be free from excessive force under\nI\nthe Fourth Amendment. This Court should also recognize that two young men\nI\nsitting handcuffed to a bench in the Pike County Jail also have the right to be free\nI\nfrom excessive force under the Fourth Amendment. No 11th Circuit case in which\n29\n\nI\nI\nqualified immunity was granted, involved the infliction of severe, and\nI disproportionate force after the arrest had been fidly effected, the arrestee fully\nsecure, and all danger vitiated. The facts of this case are well outside the realm of\nI\ncases in which the 11th Circuit has granted qualified immunity on the ground that\nI\nthe force used and the injury sustained were de minimus. Here the force, threats,\nI\nintimidation, and racial epithets used by Stephens go so far beyond the hazy border\nbetween excessive and acceptable force that [Stephens] had to know he was\nI\nviolating the Constitution.\nI\nVII. CONCLUSION\nI\nBased on tile foregoing argument and authority, this Court sl!ould affirm the\nI\nruling of the District Court denying summary judgment to Stephens on the basis of\nqualified immunity.\nI\nRespectfully submitted this 4thday of February, 2003.\nI\nFOSTER, JENSEN & GULLEY, LLC.\nI\nI CHRIS JENSE__.j /\nGeorgia Bar No. 391250/7\nI\nCLARK E.

Civil Action No: 3:02-CV- 124-JTC \nCITY OF ZEBULON, GEORGIA, \nROBERT LUMMUS, Individually, \nAnd in his capacity as \nPOLICE CHIEF OF THE CITY \nOF ZEBULON, GEORGIA, \nand, DENIS STEPHENS, \nDefendants. \nDEFENDANT'S INITIAL DISCLOSURES \nCOME NOW Defendant, City of Zebulon, by and through counsel and \npursuant to  Local Rule 26.1,  Northern District  of Georgia, and files  its  Initial \nDisclosures as follows: \n(1)  If the defendants are improperly identified, state defendants' correct \nidentification  and  state  whether defendant will  accept  service  of an  amended \nsummons and complaint reflecting  the  information  famished in  this  disclosure \nresponse. \n~°J \n\nResponse to No. l:  This defendant is correctly identified. \n(2)  Provide  the  names of any parties  whom defendants  contend are \nnecessary parties to  this action, but who have not been named by plaintiff.  If \ndefendants contend that there is  a question of nvsjoinder of parties,  provide the \nreasons for defendants' contention. \nResponse to No. 2 :  Defendant does not so contend. \n(3)  Provide a detailed factual basis for the defense or defenses and any \ncounterclaims or crossclaims asserted by defendants in the responsive pleading. \nResponse to No. 3:  Denis Stephens, the officer accused of violating the \nCivil Rights of the Plaintiff in this  action, came to  the City of Zebulon POST \ncertified and trained in basic law enforcement techniques.  This information was \nverified by then Police Chief Robert Lummus.  While he was employed with City of \nZebulon police, Officer Stephens was trained in the following classes:  basic radar \noperations, ASP Tactical Baton, advanced traffic law, use of die Intoxilyzer 5000, \nand advanced report writing.  The City of Zebulon adopted a detailed policy manual \nregarding the day-to-day operations and organization structure of the City of Zebulon \nPolice Department.  This manual was in effect  during the times referred  to  in \nPlaintiffs Complaint.  The policy manual contains provisions regarding the training \nof officers.  The manual also describes some of the qualifications required for hiring \n2 \n\nin  the Police Department.  All applicants had to be POST certified through the \nGeorgia Police Academy or receive a waiver from the Mayor and City Counsel.  The \npolicy manual also detailed that strip searches were to be done only when reasonable \nunder the  circumstances,  and that  conditional  strip  searches  of detainees  was \nprohibited. \nAt the time of the incident alleged in Plaintiff's Complaint, Robert Lummus \nwas the Chief of Police of the City of Zebulon Police Department.  During Officer \nStephens' time on the force, the City Council had received no word of any complaint \nregarding Stephens.  Chief Lummus had counseled Stephens for minor disciplinary \ninfractions, such as arresting a teen-ager for throwing a water balloon and using \nprofanity in front of women from town.  Chief Lummus had also told Denis Stephens \nnot to conduct any more strip searches prior to the alleged incident involving the \nPlaintiff.  Chief Lummus did not tell City Counsel about the prior strip  search \nincident.  Chief Lummus also had a written policy in practice that his officers did not \nconduct slip searches of detainees at the Pike County Jail. \nThis  Defendant  anticipates  that  there  will  be  factual  disputes  between \nPlaintiff's account of what happened to him during the alleged incident and the \naccount as recollected by Denis Stephens.  In any event, the City of Zebulon did not \nhave a policy, custom or practice which was the moving force behind any alleged \n3 \n\nconstitutional violation.  Nor did any conduct of Chief Lummus acting as  a final \npolicymaker of the City of Zebulon, cause or contribute  to  a  violation  of the \nPlaintiffs constitutional or federally protected rights. \nThis Defendant is not aware of any \"racial profiling\" or racially discriminatory \nconduct of Officer Stephens. \n(4)  Describe  in  detail  all  statutes,  codes,  regulations,  legal  principles, \nstandards and customs or usages, and illustrative case law which defendant contends \nare applicable to this action. \nResponse to No. 4:  :  There is no respondeat superior liability making a \nmunicipality liable for the wrongful acts of its police officers in performing arrests \nand searches of suspects.  Gold v.  City of Miami,  151 Fed 3d 1346 (1998).  See also \nMonell v.  Dept.  of Social Services,  436 US 658, 691, 98 S.  Ct.  2018, 56 L.  Ed.  2d \n611 (1978). \nCongress did not intend  to  impose liability  on a municipality  unless  a \ndeliberate  act attributable  to  the municipality is  the \"moving force\" behind the \nPlaintiff's deprivation of Federal Rights.  Board of County Commissioners of Bryan \nCounty, OK v.  Brown, 520 US 397, 400, 117 S.  Ct.  1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1997). \nFailure to train may amount to the deliberate indifference needed to show a \nmunicipality's  culpability only where a failure  to  train reflects  a deliberate  or \n4 \n\nconscience choice by a municipality.  Gold, 151, F 3d at 1350, citing City of Canton \nv. Harris, 489 US 378,388-89, 109 S.  Ct.  1197, 103 Led 2d 412 (1989). \nIn order to demonstrate notice on the part of the City of Zebulon, the Plaintiff \nwould have to demonstrate a pattern of incidents which would place the City on \nnotice of a need to train in that area.  Popham v.  The City of Talledaga,  908 F.  2d \n1561-1564-65 (I 1'h Cir.  1990).  This pattern of incidents must amount to a \"history of \nwidespread abuse\" that would put the City on notice of the need to train its officers in \nthis particular area.  Wright v.  Sheppard,  919 F.  2d, 919 F.  2d 665, 674 (11`h Cir. \n1990). \nThe reasonableness of Officer Stephens  traffic stop of the Plaintiff must be \njudged under standards articulated in Riley v.  City of Montgomery, AL,  104 F.  3d \n1247 (1996) and Whren v.  United States, 517 US 806, 116 S. Ct.  1769, 135 Led.  2d \n89 (1996). \nIn analyzing the hiring of a particular officer, \"the showing of an instance of \ninadequate screening is not enough to establish deliberate indifference\".  The Board \nof County Commissioners of Bryan County v.  Brown, 520 US 397, 117 S.  Cc.  1382, \n137 Led 2d 626. \n5 \n\nThe Plaintiff cannot point to any specific policy, action, or failure to act by the \nCity of Zebulon which demonstrated the requisite deliberate  indifference to  the \nPlaintiff that would authorize the Plaintiff to recover against the City itself. \n(5)  Provide the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of \neach individual likely to have discoverable information that you may use to support \nyour claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment, identifying the subjects of \nthe information.

For all \nexperts  described in  Fed.  R.Civ.P.26(a)(2)(B),  provide a separate written report \nsatisfying the provisions of that rule.  (Attach expert witness list and written reports \nto Initial Disclosures as Attachment B.) \nResponse to No. 6:  No expert  witness  has  been  retained  by  this \nDefendant at this time.  This Defendant reserves the right to supplement this response \nat a later time. \n(7)  Provide a copy of,  or description by category  and location  of,  all \ndocuments, data compilations, and tangible things in your possession, custody, or \ncontrol that  you may use to support your claims or defenses unless  solely  for \n6 \n\nimpeachment, identifying the subjects of the information.

At about 5:10 p.m. City of Zebulon Police Officer Denis Stephens initiated \na traffic stop of Evans late model Chevrolet Tahoe, allegedly for displaying a dealer \ndrive-out tag.  Once Evans stopped his vehicle, Stephens began interrogating Evans \nregarding consumption of alcohol.  Stephens arrested Evans and transported him in \nhis patrol car to the Pike County Jail.  At the jail, Stephens illegally and without any \nreasonable suspicion ordered Evans to \"exit your clothes\" and conducted a strip \nsearch of Evans.  Stephens continued his criminal investigation by requiring Evans \nto  submit  to  a state-administered  breath  test  to  determine his blood alcohol \n1 \n(3 \n\nconcentration as measured by the Intoxilyzer 5000.  Evans test registered 0.000 on \ntwo different samples.  Stephens released Evans without charging him with any \ncriminal activity. Defendant Robert Lummus was the Chief of Police for the City of \nZebulon at all times material to this action. \nThis is a civil action seeking compensatory damages against all defendants, and \npunitive damages against Stephens and Lummus in their individual capacities,  for \ncommitting acts under color of state law and depriving Plaintiff of rights secured by \nthe Constitution of the United States.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C §1983 and Title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, Plaintiff seeks money damages for the injuries he \nsuffered  as  a result of Stephens'  unlawful  acts.  Stephens violated  Evans'  4t' \nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizure by illegally \narresting him and detaining him at the Pike County Jail and conducting an illegal \nstrip search, ostensibly for drugs.  Stephens violated Evans' constitutional right of \nequal protection of the law and due process of law by engaging in a continuing \npattern and practice of race-based traffic stops of African-American motorists to \nsearch for illegal drugs, commonly known as \"racial profiling.\"  Defendant Lummus \nis liable to Plaintiff because he knowingly condoned, approved, or ratified Stephens \nracial profiling to the extent it became a pattern and practice of the City of Zebulon \nPolice  Department.  Defendant Lummus, in  the alternative,  was deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of the African-American motoring public generally, and to \nthis  Plaintiff  specifically,  by  negligently  hiring,  negligently  supervising,  and \nnegligently disciplining Defendant Stephens.  The City of Zebulon is  liable to \nPlaintiff because Defendant Lummus, as Chief of Police, was the official policy \nmaker of the City of Zebulon and as a result this pattern and practice of racial \nprofiling became an official policy of the City of Zebulon. \nThe Plaintiff's cause of action is grounded in 42 U.S.C. §1983 and Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, and state law claims of negligence. The legal issues are: \n(1)  Whether Defendant Stephens'  traffic  stop, criminal  investigation, \narrest, detention, and strip search of Evans were reasonable in the circumstances or \nwhether Stephens actions violated Evans constitutional rights secured by the 4'h, 5`h, \n2 \n\nand 14`h Amendments to the United States Constitution  and his civil rights as \nprotected by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n(2)  Whether Defendant Stephens' pattern and practice of racial profiling \nAfrican-American motorists to stop them and search them for drugs violated Evans \nconstitutional rights secured by the 41h, 51\",  and 14'' Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution and his civil rights as protected by Title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964. \n(3)  Whether Defendant Lummus was deliberately  indifferent  to  the \nconstitutional rights of African-American motorists by condoning, approving, or \nratifying the pattern and practice of racial profiling by Stephens and other City of \nZebulon Police Officers, to stop and search African-American motorists for drugs. \n(4)  Whether Defendant Lummus, as  Chief of Police, was the official \npolicy maker for the City of Zebulon such that Lummus' actions of condoning, \napproving and ratifying the pattern and practice of racial profiling of African-\nAmerican motorists became an official police policy of the City of Zebulon. \n(5)  Whether Defendant Lummus violated  Georgia state tort  law by \nnegligently hiring Defendant Stephens. \n(6)  Whether Defendant Lummus violated  Georgia state tort  law by \nnegligently supervising Defendant Stephens. \n(7)  Whether Defendant Lummus violated  Georgia state tort  law by \nnegligently disciplining Defendant Stephens. \n(8)  Whether Defendant Lummus, as the Chief of Police, was the official \npolicy maker for the City of Zebulon, to the extent that Lummus' negligence should \nbe attributed to the City of Zebulon. \n(2)  Describe  in  detail  all  statutes,  codes,  regulations,  legal  principles, \nstandards and customs or usages, and illustrative case law which Plaintiff contends are \napplicable to this action. \nRESPONSE: \n42 U.S.C. §1983 \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI \n3 \n\nBell v.

A panel of this Court reversed the district court's\ndecision on qualified immunity. We decided to vacate the panel's decision and to rehear the appeal. Assuming\nPlaintiffs' version of the facts is accurate, we now conclude that the pertinent conduct violated Plaintiffs'\nconstitutional rights and that qualified immunity applies to just one alleged violation.\nBACKGROUND\nFor this appeal, these alleged and evidenced facts will be supposed to be the true facts.\nPlaintiffs are two black males. The events giving rise to this appeal occurred on 22 January 1999; Plaintiffs were\nthen in their early and middle twenties. That night, Evans and Jordan were traveling from Atlanta, Georgia, to\nStatesboro, Georgia, where both were or had been enrolled at Georgia Southern University. Evans drove himself\nand Jordan in a rental car. Despite that Evans had made the journey between Atlanta and Statesboro on many\nearlier occasions, they became lost and traveled down Interstate 85 instead of Interstate 75.\n\nWhile trying to return to Interstate 75, Evans and Jordan passed through the City of Zebulon, Georgia. There,\nOfficer Stephens, a white male, stopped Evans after Stephens clocked Evans's car traveling at a speed of\n[1]\nseventy-two miles per hour in a forty-five mile per hour zone.  A video camera in Stephens's patrol car recorded\nthe stop. As Stephens approached Evans, another police officer from the City of Concord Police Department\narrived on the scene. Stephens suspected Evans might have been driving under the influence, but Evans denied\ndoing so. Stephens then ordered Evans out of the car and searched Evans's pockets. Stephens claims he found\na beer bottle top in one of Evans's pockets. Evans denies the top was there, and Stephens did not show the\nbottle top to the recording camera.\nEvans stayed at the rear of the rental car when Officer Stephens approached Jordan, who remained seated in\nthe passenger seat. Stephens took Jordan's drivers license and asked him to exit the car as well. With Evans's\n1276 permission, Stephens *1276 searched the car for about five minutes. Stephens claims he saw an open container\nof an alcoholic beverage in the car. Evans denies it, and Stephens did not follow his usual practice of showing the\n[2]\ncontainer to the recording camera.\nOfficer Stephens cited Evans for speeding and read him the Georgia Implied Consent Law, O.C.G.A. § 40-6-392\n(a)(4). After Stephens asked whether Evans would consent to a breathalyzer, Evans said he wanted to call his\nlawyer. Stephens then placed him under arrest and repeated the request. Evans again said that he wanted to talk\nto his attorney. Stephens charged Evans with D.U.I. refusal and speeding and then placed him in the patrol car.\nAt Stephens's deposition, he said that Evans had alcohol on his breath, bloodshot eyes, and an unstable\ndemeanor. Officer Stephens concluded the facts authorized the arrest of Evans.\nAt the scene of the stop, Officer Stephens, by radio, requested a search on Jordan's name to check for\noutstanding warrants. The dispatcher relayed to Stephens that a \"Detre Jordan\" with Plaintiff-Appellant Jordan's\n[3]\ndate of birth had an outstanding arrest warrant. Stephens then arrested Jordan.  After placing Jordan under\narrest, Stephens searched Jordan's pockets; and Stephens said that he would release Jordan if the warrant was\nfor someone else. While waiting on the tow truck, Stephens and another officer searched the car and surrounding\narea for approximately seven minutes. This search of the car was the second one that revealed, according to\nPlaintiffs, nothing.\nOfficer Stephens then drove Plaintiffs to the Pike County jail. Plaintiffs say that on the way to the jail, Jordan\ncontinued to explain the warrant was not for him and to request a phone call. Both men also recall Stephens\nsaying that he is the judge and jury in Zebulon and that he decides who can make phone calls. Evans also recalls\nStephens saying that he would \"send you niggers away for a long time.\"\nAccording to Plaintiffs, Officer Stephens patted them down again before they entered the county jail building.\nStephens informed the jailer on duty, Officer Andre Dawson, of the charges against Plaintiffs. Dawson recalls\nreviewing the report on the \"Jordan\" in the warrant and concluding that it was not the Plaintiff; Dawson\nencouraged Stephens to release Jordan.\nOfficer Stephens became angry and walked Jordan to a room that appeared to be a supply closet or mop storage\nroom. There, Stephens pestered Jordan with racist language and ordered Jordan to place his hands on the wall\nand to remove his shoes and shirt. Jordan complied. Stephens then ordered Jordan to take off his remaining\nclothes. When asked to lower his underwear, Jordan protested by turning around and saying that Stephens had\nthe wrong person. Jordan says that Stephens then put him in a choke hold and held him against the wall until\n[4]\nJordan began to gag.  Jordan faced the wall again; and then Evans was thrown into the room, hitting Jordan\n1277 and causing both men to fall. As Jordan tried to stand, Stephens hit Jordan's side with a baton-like *1277 \"cold\n[5]\nblack\" object.\nEvans says that, once he was in the room and standing against the wall, Stephens again ordered Jordan to take\noff his underwear. According to Jordan, after Officer Stephens 00 in Evans's presence 00 pulled Jordan's\n97 97\nunderwear to his ankles, Stephens used the same \"cold black\" object to separate Jordan's butt cheeks and\n\"stuck me in my anus.\"\n\nAfter searching Jordan, Stephens turned to Evans. Evans says Stephens told him to remove his underwear and\nthen 00 in Jordan's presence 00 placed \"the [same] stick in my ass.\" According to Evans, Stephens also used the\n97 97\nbaton to lift Evans's and Jordan's testicles. Evans testified at his deposition that Stephens used the same baton\non both Plaintiffs and that Stephens did not clean or wipe down the baton during the strip search.\nWhile conducting the strip search, Stephens taunted both Plaintiffs with laughter, racist language and threats of\nprison 00 where Stephens promised to send Plaintiffs. After the strip search, Evans and Jordan were made to\n97\ndress quickly. Plaintiffs were then handcuffed to the bench in front of the jailer; they then spent the night in the\n[6]\ngeneral jail population.\nOfficer Stephens said he had a reasonable suspicion that Plaintiffs had drugs based on their demeanor\n(nervousness at the roadside stop) and their story of being lost. This suspicion, Stephens claims, justified the\nstrip search for drugs.\nPlaintiffs brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, claiming in part, that\nStephens violated their rights to the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\nas well as Title VII of the 1965 Civil Rights Act. In the light of Defendants' motions for summary judgment, the\nclaims were narrowed to ones based on the Fourth Amendment. The district court decided, if Plaintiffs' story was\ntrue, that the strip search violated Evan's and Jordan's constitutional rights and that Stephens was entitled to no\nimmunity. A panel of this Court agreed that the Constitution was violated, because (1) Stephens lacked\nreasonable suspicion to perform the strip search; and (2) the manner in which he conducted the strip search was\nunreasonable. Evans v. City of Zebulon, 351 F.3d 485, 497 (11th Cir.2003),vacated by Evans v. City of Zebulon,\n364 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2004). The panel also concluded that qualified immunity applied to Officer Stephens for\nboth violations. Id.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nWe review denials of summary judgment de novo. Kesinger ex rel. Estate of Kesinger v. Herrington, 381 F.3d\n1243, 1247 (11th Cir.2004). We do not make credibility determinations, but instead believe the \"evidence of the\nnon-movant . . . and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\" Stewart v. Booker T. Washington Ins.,\n232 F.3d 844, 848 (11th Cir.2000) (citations omitted).\n1278 *1278 As we said in Draper v. Reynolds, 369 F.3d 1270, 1272 (11th Cir.2004), and Rowe v. Ft. Lauderdale, 279\nF.3d 1271, 1279 n. 9 (11th Cir.2002), we accept the nonmovant's version of the events when reviewing a decision\non summary judgment. When the nonmovant has testified to events, we do not (as urged by Plaintiffs' counsel)\npick and choose bits from other witnesses' essentially incompatible accounts (in effect, declining to credit some of\nthe nonmovant's own testimony) and then string together those portions of the record to form the story that we\n[7]\ndeem most helpful to the nonmovant.  Instead, when conflicts arise between the facts evidenced by the parties,\nwe credit the nonmoving party's version. Our duty to read the record in the nonmovant's favor stops short of not\ncrediting the nonmovant's testimony in whole or part: the courts owe a nonmovant no duty to disbelieve his sworn\ntestimony which he chooses to submit for use in the case to be decided.\nDISCUSSION\nWe mainly must decide two issues. Whether the strip searches performed on Plaintiffs violated their rights under\nthe United States Constitution and, if so, whether that right 00 given the circumstances facing Officer Stephens 00\n97 97\nwas already so clearly established that every objectively reasonable officer would have known that Defendant\nwas violating federal law at the time. We conclude that the strip search here violated two rights of Plaintiffs, both\narising under the Fourth Amendment. First, the strip searches 00 as a post-arrest criminal investigation 00 were\n97 97\nunreasonable, because they were not supported by a reasonable suspicion of the existence of drug evidence.\nSecond, even if some strip search might have been lawful, the manner in which these strip searches were\nperformed was also unreasonable as a matter of federal law. In addition, we conclude that the right to be free\naltogether of a strip search was, under the circumstances, not already clearly established at the time of the\n\nincident, but that the Fourth Amendment itself provided, at the time, sufficient notice that the manner of these\nparticular searches was \"unreasonable\" in the constitutional sense.\n1. The Constitutional Violations.\nThe panel opinion in this case included these words: \"Arrestees who are to be detained in the general jail\npopulation can constitutionally be subjected to a strip search only if the search is supported by reasonable\nsuspicion that such a search will reveal weapons or contraband.\" Evans v. City of Zebulon, 351 F.3d 485, 490\n(11th Cir.2003)vacated by Evans v. City of Zebulon, 364 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2004). And these words doubtlessly\ncontributed to causing some judges to vote for en banc rehearing.\nMost of us are uncertain that jailers are required to have a reasonable suspicion of weapons or contraband\nbefore strip searching 00 for security and safety purposes 00 arrestees bound for the general jail population. For\n97 97\nbackground, see Cuesta v. Sch. Bd. of Miami-Dade County, 285 F.3d 962, 969 n. 6 (11th Cir.2002) (strip search\npolicy at jail); Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.2001) (same); Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678,\n1279 682 *1279 (11th Cir.2000) (same) (solitary confinement). Never has the Supreme Court imposed such a\nrequirement. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884-85, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (rejecting\nclaim that strip search policy at a federal jail for mostly pretrial detainees violated the Fourth Amendment per se); \nUnited States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 808 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 1239 n. 9, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974) (reserving\nwhether \"custodial searches incident to incarceration\" might violate the Constitution in either \"number or . . .\nmanner of perpetration\").\nBut, on reflection, this case provides no opportunity to decide the question of when jailers 00 for security and\n97\nsafety purposes 00 may lawfully conduct strip searches of persons about to become inmates in the general jail\n97\npopulation. This case raises no questions about the necessities of jail administration. Cf. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559-61,\n99 S.Ct. at 1884-86. This case involves a different kind of search altogether: a post-arrest investigatory strip\nsearch by the police looking for evidence (and not weapons). Officer Stephens 00 who was not a jailer 00 testified\n97 97\n(without contradiction from others) that he strip-searched Plaintiffs because he (as the arresting officer) believed\nthem to be in possession of illegal drugs: the search was part of a criminal investigation looking for evidence.\nNever has the Supreme Court explicitly addressed the standard applied to determine if a post-arrest investigatory\nstrip search (away from the complicated context of the nation's borders) violates the Fourth Amendment. Several\ncases provide guidance, including Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990); Bell,\n441 U.S. at 520, 99 S.Ct. at 1861; Edwards, 415 U.S. at 800, 94 S.Ct. at 1234; United States v. Robinson, 414\nU.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), and Gustafson v. Florida, 414 U.S. 260, 94 S.Ct. 488, 38 L.Ed.2d\n456 (1973).\nBell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885, 60 L.Ed.2d 447, does involve strip searches. Bell concluded that such\nsearches, of inmates in a jail for security purposes, were permissible without probable cause; but it does not\naddress what standard is necessary for investigative searches outside Bell's jail security context.\nWhen we balance the need for investigative strip searches for evidence that might be hidden on the arrestee's\nbody against the intrusiveness inherent in a strip search, we believe Buie, 494 U.S. at 325, 110 S.Ct. at 1093,\nprovides the analytical framework that, at a minimum, would apply to strip searches for evidence. There, the\nCourt addressed a post-arrest protective sweep search of the arrestee's house. The Court relied, in part, on Terry\nv. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (addressing pat down searches of persons). Id.,494\nU.S. at 331, 110 S.Ct. at 1097. Buie concluded that searches of property incident to arrest must be justified by\n\"articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, would warrant a reasonably\nprudent officer in believing\" the search was necessary. 494 U.S. at 334, 110 S.Ct. at 1098. Put differently, we are\nconfident that an officer must have at least a reasonable suspicion that the strip search is necessary for\n1280 evidentiary reasons.[8] Perhaps the actual standard is *1280 higher than reasonable suspicion, especially where,\nas here, the search includes touching genitalia and penetrating anuses. But because Officer Stephens 00 in the\n97\nlight of the supposed facts 00 did not meet even the minimum possible standard of reasonable suspicion, we need\n97\n\nnot decide if the actual standard is something even higher to decide whether Officer Stephens failed to comply\n[9]\nwith the Constitution.\nWhether an officer has a reasonable suspicion is an objective question viewed from the standpoint of a\nreasonable police officer at the scene. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1661-62,\n134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). It is based on the totality of the circumstances, Garrett v. Athens-Clarke County, 378\nF.3d 1274, 1279 (11th Cir.2004), and is a question of law to be reviewed de novo. Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 696-97,\n116 S.Ct. at 1662.\nOfficer Stephens contends that Plaintiffs' nervousness, their story about being lost, and their traveling in a rental\ncar established reasonable suspicion of drugs capable of justifying the search. After the events underlying this\ncase had occurred, we rejected an analogous argument in United States v. Boyce, 351 F.3d 1102, 1109 (11th\nCir.2003), when the government attempted to use similar facts to provide law enforcement officers with a\nreasonable suspicion for a prolonged traffic stop to search for drugs. In the case now before us, Plaintiffs were\narrested not for drugs, but for DUI refusal and an outstanding arrest warrant (for an unspecified offense).\nNevertheless, even if the adjuncts of this stop and arrest might have initially supported a reasonable suspicion of\ndrugs, the strength of that suspicion was undermined by other events before the strip search got started.\nOfficer Stephens searched Plaintiffs' car for over ten minutes, and taking the facts most favorable to Plaintiffs, he\nfound nothing about drugs. In addition, Stephens searched the area surrounding the car and found nothing about\ndrugs. Furthermore, Plaintiffs testified that Stephens had checked their pockets and twice patted down each of\nthem before he strip-searched them in the jail. These searches also revealed nothing. This lack of revealed\nevidence undermines the reasonableness of Officer Stephens's belief that Plaintiffs possessed drugs. See Brent\nv. Ashley, 247 F.3d 1294, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (addressing strip search by customs agents). Moreover, Stephens\ndid not observe Plaintiffs attempting to hide anything on their person. See Kraushaar v. Flanigan, 45 F.3d 1040,\n1046 (7th Cir.1995) (addressing strip search at jail). Thus, we decide, bearing all the circumstances in mind, that\nOfficer Stephens violated Plaintiffs' right to be free from an unreasonable search when he performed an\ninvestigatory strip search for drugs: he was without the necessary reasonable suspicion that Plaintiffs (arrested\n[10]\non other charges) had drugs 00 the asserted ground for the searches 00 on their person.\n97 97\n1281 *1281 We also conclude the manner in which Officer Stephens conducted the strip search violated Plaintiffs'\nconstitutional rights. Though not directly applicable to this case, Bell acknowledged that even correctional officers\nin a jail cannot properly conduct strip searches of incarcerated inmates in \"an abusive fashion.\" 441 U.S. at 560,\n99 S.Ct. at 1885 (internal citations omitted). Abuse cannot be condoned. While searches need not be delicately\nconducted in the least intrusive manner, they must be conducted in a reasonable manner.\nViewing the facts in their totality and taking the facts most favorable to Plaintiffs' version, we conclude that\nStephens conducted these strip searches in an unconstitutional manner. Plaintiffs were taken to and searched in\nan abnormal place (thus, capable of exciting more fear): a broom closet or supply room, not a dedicated search\ncell, medical examination room, or even a bathroom. See Justice v. Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th\nCir.1992) (approving of private room); Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d at 678, 682 (11th Cir.2000) (bathroom). Little\nrespect for privacy was observed. Each Plaintiff was forced to disrobe, ridiculed, and penetrated by an object in\nfront of the other. See Justice, 961 F.2d at 193 (noting that arrestee and officers were the only people in room).\nThe physical aspects of the searches are also disturbing. Unnecessary force was used. Evans was thrown into\nJordan, causing both men to collapse. As Jordan tried to stand back up, Officer Stephens hit him with a baton-like\nobject. It matters that a body cavity search was undertaken. In addition, while conducting the search, Stephens\ninserted the same baton or club 00 without intervening sanitation 00 in each Plaintiffs' anus and used the same\n97 97\n[11]\nbaton or club to lift each man's testicles.  Apart from other issues, this last practice is highly unsanitary. See \nBonitz v. Fair, 804 F.2d 164, 173 (1st Cir.1986) (acknowledging non-hygienic manner of search) overruled on\nother grounds by Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F.2d 124, 128 (1st Cir.1998),overruled by Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S.\n304, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995).\nIn considering the totality of the circumstances, we also consider Officer Stephens's language. Brown v. City of\nHialeah, 30 F.3d 1433, 1436 (11th Cir.1994). See also Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885 (citing Levi, 439\n\nF.Supp. at 147). From the time Plaintiffs were secured in the patrol car until the end of the search, Stephens used\n1282 threatening and racist language.[12] We accept that such language *1282 has an impact on people and counts\ntowards the unreasonableness of the manner of the searches.\nWe do not imply that words alone can make the manner of an otherwise properly conducted search\nunconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. But in this case, the totality of the circumstances 00 for example,\n97\nthe physical force, anal penetration, unsanitariness of the process, terrifying language, and lack of privacy 00\n97\ncollectively establish a constitutional violation, especially when the search was being made in the absence of\nexigent circumstances requiring the kind of immediate action that might make otherwise questionable police\nconduct, at least arguably, reasonable.\n2. Qualified Immunity\nQualified immunity is an affirmative defense available to public officers acting within the scope of their\n[13]\ndiscretionary authority. Harbert Int'l Inc. v. James, 157 F.3d 1271, 1281 (11th Cir.1998).  It shields public\nofficers from liability so long as the transgressed right, given the circumstances, was not already clearly\nestablished, \"that is `whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the\nsituation he confronted.'\" Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 563, 124 S.Ct. 1284, 1293, 157 L.Ed.2d 1068 (2004)\n(quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). The applicable law\nis clearly established if the \"`preexisting law dictates, that is, truly compel[s],' the conclusion for all reasonable,\nsimilarly situated public officials that what Defendant was doing violated Plaintiffs' federal rights in the\ncircumstances.\" Marsh v. Butler County, 268 F.3d 1014, 1031 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc) (citation omitted). In rare\ncircumstances, a \"right may be so clear from the text of the Constitution or federal statute that no prior decision is\nnecessary to give clear notice of it to an official.\" Rowe v. Ft. Lauderdale, 279 F.3d 1271, 1280 n. 10 (11th\nCir.2002) (citation omitted). In such circumstances, the violation is obvious.\nA post-arrest investigatory strip search did not obviously violate the Fourth Amendment on its face in 1999. In\naddition, in 1999, no applicable cases provided a police officer with fair notice that he must have, at least, a\nreasonable suspicion to conduct a post-arrest investigatory strip search of an adult and with fair notice that the\n[14]\nfacts before Officer Stephens were insufficient to make his suspicion reasonable for the search.  The law was\nnot settled for what standard applied to post-arrest investigatory strip searches, and Supreme Court precedent\nwas very deferential to post-arrest investigations. See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 807-09, 94\nS.Ct. 1234, 1239-40, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974); Gustafson v. Florida, 414 U.S. 260, 265-66, 94 S.Ct. 488, 491-92,\n1283 38 L.Ed.2d 456 (1973); United States v.*1283Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235-36, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477, 38 L.Ed.2d\n427 (1973). Justice v. Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192-93 (11th Cir.1992), could not squarely govern this case:\nit addressed a strip search of a juvenile arrested for minor offenses (loitering and truancy), and it acknowledged\nthat unique concerns arise with strip searching youngsters. See generally, Brosseau v. Haugen, ___ U.S. ___,\n125 S.Ct. 596, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004). And United States v. Boyce, 351 F.3d 1102, 1109 (11th Cir.2003), was\ndecided four years after the incident in question. So, Officer Stephens is protected by qualified immunity insofar\nas the claim is one for conducting a strip search at all.\nQualified immunity, however, does not shield Stephens from Plaintiffs' separate claim that the manner of the strip\nsearch violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment. No preexisting case law established this violation or\nmade it obviously clear. Justice and Bell were the only applicable cases to address strip searches, and they could\nnot squarely govern this case. Both were materially different from this case, and both upheld strip searches.\nBut the text of the Fourth Amendment prohibits \"unreasonable\" searches. Seldom does a general standard such\nas \"to act reasonably\" put officers on notice that certain conduct will violate federal law given the precise\ncircumstances before them: Fourth Amendment law is intensely fact specific. But we conclude the supposed facts\nof this case take the manner of the searches well beyond the \"hazy border\" that sometimes separates lawful\nconduct from unlawful conduct. See generally, Priester v. City of Riviera Beach, 208 F.3d 919, 926 (11th\nCir.2000). The violation was obvious.\n\nEvery objectively reasonable officer would have known that, when conducting a strip search, it is unreasonable to\ndo so in the manner demonstrated by the sum of the facts alleged by Plaintiffs. The totality of the facts alleged\nhere made this violation 00 on the day of the search 00 clear from the terms of the Constitution itself: No objectively\n97 97\nreasonable policeman could have believed that the degrading and forceful manner of this strip search (especially\nin the light of the complete lack of circumstances that might have called for immediate action to conduct a search\nwithout the time for cool and calm thought about how to proceed) was \"reasonable\" in the constitutional sense.\nAccordingly, the decision of the district court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\nCARNES, Circuit Judge, concurring specially, in which DUBINA and HULL, Circuit Judges, join:\nI concur in all of the Court's opinion but write separately for two reasons. One is to explicate a holding of the\nCourt, and the other is to offer my views on an issue that was briefed and argued but which the Court does not\nreach.\nI.\nIn his deposition one of the plaintiffs, Peter Evans, made a number of statements that supported his claims but\none statement that was not favorable to his own case. Another witness offered testimony on that specific point\nthat was more favorable to the plaintiffs. The Court correctly holds that for summary judgment purposes we\naccept a non-movant's own testimony warts and all, instead of snipping from that testimony the parts that are\nless favorable than what some other witness says. There is good reason that, as the Court aptly puts it, \"[o]ur\n1284 duty to *1284 read the record in the nonmovant's favor stops short of not crediting the nonmovant's testimony in\nwhole or part: the courts owe a nonmovant no duty to disbelieve his sworn testimony which he chooses to submit\nfor use in the case to be decided.\" Ante at 1278.\nThe good reason is that, absent some extraordinary circumstance, no reasonable jury would believe that a party\nwas lying when he said something harmful to his own case. Reasonable juries know that is not how human\nnature, influenced by self-interest, works. And when we decide whether summary judgment is warranted, we view\nthe evidence in the non-movant's favor, but only to the extent that it would be reasonable for a jury to resolve the\nfactual issues that way. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d\n202 (1986) (to defeat summary judgment \"there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the\nplaintiff\"); Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1282 (11th Cir.1999) (\"[T]here must be sufficient\nevidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff . . . .\"); id. (\"The nonmovant need not be given\nthe benefit of every inference but only of every reasonable inference.\" (language from the district court's order,\nattached as Appendix A and adopted by the Court)); Brown v. City of Clewiston, 848 F.2d 1534, 1540 n. 12 (11th\nCir.1988) (\"The summary judgment standard requires that we resolve all reasonable doubts in favor of the non-\nmoving party, but it does not require us to resolve all doubts in such a manner.\" (quotation and ellipsis omitted)).\nII.\nOne of the issues we had the parties brief and orally argue is: \"Whether arrestees who are to be detained in the\ngeneral jail population can constitutionally be subjected to a strip search only if the search is supported by\nreasonable suspicion that such a search will reveal weapons or contraband.\" We also received a number of\namicus briefs on that issue, some of which were helpful. The opinion for the Court notes that: \"Most of us are\nuncertain that jailers are required to have a reasonable suspicion of weapons or contraband before strip\nsearching 00 for security and safety purposes 00 arrestees bound for the general jail population.\" Ante at 1278-79.\n97 97\nNonetheless, the Court properly determines that this is not the case in which to decide that issue. It is not,\nbecause the strip searches in this case were undertaken by law enforcement officers looking for evidence of a\ncrime that had been committed, instead of by the officials at the county jail acting for general security reasons.\nEven though the issue cannot be decided in this case, I offer my present views on it for whatever they may be\nworth. This expression comes with the realization that \"dicta in our opinions is not binding on anyone for any\n\npurpose,\" but also with the hope that this will be one of those occasions in which dicta serves a useful purpose. \nSee McDonald's Corp. v. Robertson, 147 F.3d 1301, 1314-15 (11th Cir.1998) (Carnes, J., concurring specially).\nA.\nMy present view is that reasonable suspicion is not necessary for a strip search of an arrestee who is to be\ndetained in the general jail population, if that search is conducted pursuant to a generally applicable, reasonable\njail policy designed to promote safety and security by guarding against the smuggling of weapons and other\ncontraband into a detention facility. This view is contrary to the current circuit law on the subject, at least insofar\n1285 as misdemeanor arrestees are concerned. In Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir. *1285 2001), involving\nthe strip search of a misdemeanor arrestee, a panel of this Court held that the county's strip search policy\nviolated the Fourth Amendment because it did not require reasonable suspicion. Id. at 1342-43; see also \nSkurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678, 682 (11th Cir.2000) (upholding a strip search of a misdemeanor arrestee\nbecause there was reasonable suspicion, but stating in dicta that a policy of strip searching all detainees in the\nabsence of reasonable suspicion does not comport with the Fourth Amendment's requirements).\nOur circuit law is the same as that of every other circuit to address the issue insofar as those detained on non-\nfelony charges are concerned. Each of the other circuits to speak on the matter has concluded that a person\narrested on a misdemeanor charge may not be strip searched upon being placed in the general jail population\nunless there is reasonable suspicion to believe that he is concealing a weapon or other contraband. Masters v.\nCrouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989); Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dep't, 849 F.2d 195, 198-99 (5th\nCir.1988); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 615 (9th Cir.1984),\noverruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir.1999)(en banc); Mary Beth\nG. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir.1983); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir.1981). A\n[1]\nstrong argument can be made that all of those decisions, and our own decision in Wilson, are wrong.\nThe problem is that all of these decisions seem to read Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d\n447 (1979), as imposing a requirement of reasonable suspicion for detention facility strip searches. As a majority\nof the present en banc Court notes, albeit in dicta, neither Bell nor any other Supreme Court decision imposes\nsuch a requirement. Ante at 1278-79 (\"Never has the Supreme Court imposed such a requirement.\"). So, all of\nthe decisions that require reasonable suspicion seem to be based on a false premise.\nIn misinterpreting the Bell decision, we and other courts have focused on a single sentence of the opinion in that\ncase to the exclusion of virtually everything else it says. In that one sentence the Supreme Court said: \"But we\n1286 deal here with the question whether visual body-cavity inspections *1286 as contemplated by the [facility's] rules\ncan ever be conducted on less than probable cause.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885 (emphasis omitted).\nThe Court answered \"yes,\" but neither the question nor the answer compels the conclusion that \"less than\nprobable cause\" means \"reasonable suspicion.\" The absence of reasonable suspicion is also \"less than probable\ncause.\"\nThe Supreme Court simply did not say in Bell that before a visual body-cavity inspection can be performed on an\narrestee who is being put into a detention facility there must be reasonable suspicion to believe that detainee is\ncarrying a weapon or other contraband. To infer that requirement from one sentence of the Bell opinion puts more\nweight on the sentence than it will bear. It also ignores the rest of the majority's opinion as well as the\ninterpretation of that opinion put forward by Justice Powell in his dissenting opinion, id. at 563, 99 S.Ct. at 1886,\nan interpretation which went unchallenged by the majority.\nBell involved a class action suit brought by pretrial detainees being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter in New York City. The MCC required all inmates, including pretrial detainees, \"convicted inmates who are\nawaiting sentencing or transportation to federal prison,\" \"convicted prisoners who have been lodged at the facility\nunder writs of habeas corpus ... issued to ensure their presence at upcoming trials, witnesses in protective\ncustody, and persons incarcerated for contempt,\" id. at 524, 99 S.Ct. at 1866, \"to expose their body cavities for\nvisual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the\n[2]\ninstitution,\" id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\n\nThe pretrial detainees alleged in their complaint that the MCC's strip search policy violated their Fourth\n[3]\nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.  The district court agreed, and enjoined MCC from\nconducting the searches absent individualized probable cause to believe that the detainee was concealing a\nweapon or other contraband. Id. The Second Circuit affirmed. Id. The question the Supreme Court had before it\nwas this: \"whether visual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by the MCC rules can ever be conducted on\nless than probable cause.\" Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. The Supreme Court answered \"yes,\" after \"[b]alancing\nthe significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates.\" Id.;\nsee also id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nIn striking that balance, the Court weighed \"the privacy interests of the inmates,\" id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885 00\n97\n\"the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, . . . and the place in which it is\nconducted,\" id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 188400against \"the significant and legitimate security interests of the\n97\ninstitution,\" id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. In the end, the Bell Court concluded that those security interests of the\n1287 detention *1287 facility outweighed the privacy interests of the pretrial detainees. Id.\nWhile the Court did \"not underestimate the degree to which these searches may invade the personal privacy of\ninmates\" or ignore the fact \"that on occasion a security guard may conduct the search in an abusive fashion,\" id.,\nthere was a far more compelling interest on the other side of the scale. As the Court explained: \"A detention\nfacility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other\ncontraband is all too common an occurrence.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. The Court deemed that a weighty\nconsideration even though the record indicated only one instance in three years \"where an MCC inmate was\ndiscovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the institution on his person.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. The\nCourt believed that fact \"may be more a testament to the effectiveness of this search technique as a deterrent\nthan to any lack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and import such items when the opportunity\narises.\" Id.\nThe Supreme Court in Bell took a categorical approach, deciding whether the detention facility's strip search\npolicy generally was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, not whether it was reasonable in an individual\ncase. See id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885; see also Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 538, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3206, 82\nL.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (citing Bell for the proposition that \"[i]n some contexts, . . . the\nCourt has rejected the case-by-case approach to the `reasonableness' inquiry in favor of an approach that\ndetermines the reasonableness of contested practices in a categorical fashion\").\nThe most overlooked part of the Bell decision is Justice Powell's dissent. He dissented for one and only one\nreason, which is that the majority did not require reasonable suspicion for conducting the strip searches in that\ncase. His concise dissenting opinion states in its entirety:\nI join the opinion of the Court except the discussion and holding with respect to body-cavity\nsearches. In view of the serious intrusion on one's privacy occasioned by such a search, I think at\nleast some level of cause, such as a reasonable suspicion, should be required to justify the anal\nand genital searches described in this case. I therefore dissent on this issue.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 563, 99 S.Ct. at 1886 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The \"searches\ndescribed in this case\" are the strip searches performed on all MCC pretrial detainees, not just those charged\nwith felonies. The detainees who were searched included those charged with misdemeanors or violations, and\neven those charged with no wrong doing at all but who were being held as witnesses in protective custody. See\nid. at 524, 99 S.Ct. at 1866.\nJustice Powell's dissenting opinion is evidence that we and other circuits have misread the Bell majority opinion\nas requiring reasonable suspicion before detainees can be strip searched. If the Bell majority had held what we\nand other circuits say it did, there would have been no dissenting opinion from Justice Powell. Granted, it can be\nrisky to place too much reliance on dissenting opinions because they sometimes follow a Chicken Little or\ndoomsday approach, exaggerating the nature and extent of the majority opinion in order to assail it. Justice\nPowell's dissent in Bell cannot reasonably be viewed as that type of dissent, however, because its only\ndisagreement with the majority is about the one specific point it raises. If the majority had not permitted strip\n\n1288 searches of pretrial detainees without reasonable *1288 suspicion, Justice Powell would not have dissented at\nall.\nThe point is that, from his perspective inside the Court, Justice Powell had a better sense of the majority's holding\nin Bell than any circuit court of appeals could, and he understood the holding to permit strip searches without\nreasonable suspicion. Not only that, but if the majority had not intended to permit strip searches of pretrial\ndetainees without reasonable suspicion, it would have been a simple matter to note that in the opinion in answer\nto Justice Powell's pointed statement that the Court was allowing them.\nThe courts, including our own, that have read a requirement of reasonable suspicion into the Bell decision have\nmisinterpreted a sentence of that opinion. They also have ignored Justice Powell's dissenting opinion and the\nmajority's failure to deny the sole point of that dissent. Interpreting the Bell decision as not requiring reasonable\nsuspicion is a fairer reading than interpreting the decision to require it.\nB.\nThe panel in Wilson appears to have interpreted Bell to require reasonable suspicion, at least for strip searches\ninvolving non-felony detainees, but it seems to me that under Bell there is a three-step analysis for deciding\nwhether a detention facility's policy is constitutional. The first step is to determine whether the detention facility\nhas a strip search policy permitting such searches without reasonable suspicion. Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nAbsent such a policy, the detention facility does need individualized reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip\nsearch on a detainee. See Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir.1992).\nIf the detention facility does have a policy permitting strip searches without reasonable suspicion, the second step\nof the Bell analysis is to balance the institutional interests of the facility against the privacy interests of the\ndetainee to determine whether the policy is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99\nS.Ct. at 1885. The Supreme Court held in Bell that MCC's visual body-cavity search policy was \"reasonable\"\nunder the Fourth Amendment even though there was \"only one instance where an MCC inmate was discovered\nattempting to smuggle contraband into the institution on his person.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. The Court did\nso based on testimony from \"[c]orrections officials\" that \"visual cavity searches were necessary not only to\ndiscover but also to deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other contraband into the institution.\" Id. at 558,\n99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nIf the detention facility's security interests outweigh the privacy interests of the detainee, the third step is to\ndetermine whether the strip search was \"conducted in a reasonable manner,\" which means in compliance with\nthe facility's reasonable policy. Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885.\nC.\nUsually, it will be simple enough to determine whether the detention facility has a strip search policy (the first\nstep), and whether the policy was followed in a particular case (the third step). Most cases will turn on the second\nstep of the analysis. Our own Wilson decision did, and so did all of the decisions of other circuits that have\nalready been cited. For that reason, the second step of the analysis merits closer attention.\nDetention facilities are \"unique place[s] fraught with serious security dangers.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. Many\nof those who are being detained have been convicted of, or charged with, committing violent felonies. Even as to\n1289 the other detainees, a *1289 significant percentage have \"prior felony criminal histories or gang affiliations, which\nmight make them greater security risks than the charges pending against them indicate[ ].\" Dodge v. County of\nOrange, 282 F.Supp.2d 41, 48 (S.D.N.Y.2003),rev'd on other grounds103 Fed.Appx. 688 (2d Cir.2004). That is\ntrue of those arrested for misdemeanors as well as those arrested on felony charges.\nThe gang affiliation of inmates, in particular, is a \"serious security risk.\" Id. At the county jail involved in the Dodge\ncase there were at least fifty gang members being held on any given day. Id. Not surprisingly, \"[g]ang members\nare often more violent, dangerous, and manipulative than other inmates, regardless of the nature of the charges\n\nagainst them. They are also more likely than other inmates to attempt to coerce family members or to coerce,\ncajole, or intimidate lesser violators into smuggling contraband into the facility.\" Id. (citations omitted).\nContraband poses the greatest security risk for officials at detention facilities. As one expert explained, \"one of\nthe primary objectives of any correctional facility must be to prevent the introduction of `contraband' into a\ncorrectional facility due to the dangers that contraband presents in a correctional setting.\" Id. at 46 (citing the\ntestimony of George Camp, a leading corrections facility expert and a consultant to forty-eight states on the\nadministration of detention facilities). \"Contraband\" is \"anything that an inmate is not permitted to have in a\ncorrectional facility,\" including obvious things, like weapons, ammunition, or drugs, and \"lesser\" items, like money,\ncigarettes, or \"excess prison issue items\" (e.g. clothing and linens). Id. at 46-47. Of course, weapons and objects\nthat can be made into weapons pose the most direct and obvious threat to security within a detention facility, and\nwithin the courthouses to which the detainees are taken for hearings or trials.\nNon-weapon contraband is also bad because it \"can be used by inmates to barter, and thus be held over the\nheads of other inmates.\" Id. at 47. Bartering \"tends to disrupt prison operations by allowing certain inmates, or\ngroups of inmates, to exercise authority in competition with correctional staff,\" which in turn \"increase[s] the level\nof violence and endanger[s] the health, safety, and well-being of inmates, staff, and civilians in [the] correctional\n[4]\nfacility.\" Id.\nOf course, detention facility officials have a legal obligation to ensure, to the extent reasonably feasible, that their\nfacilities are safe not only for those detained but also for those who work there and those who visit. As the\nSupreme Court has put it, \"central to all other corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal\nsecurity within the corrections facilities themselves.\" Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804, 41\nL.Ed.2d 495 (1974),quoted in Bell, 441 U.S. at 546-47, 99 S.Ct. at 1878. It is for that reason the Supreme Court\nhas held that \"even when an institutional restriction infringes a specific constitutional guarantee,\" we must\nevaluate that practice in light of this central objective. Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878. \"Prison\n1290 administrators therefore should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption *1290 and execution of\npolicies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain\ninstitutional security.\" Id.\nThose who run detention facilities are convinced that strip search policies are essential to maintaining safety in\ntheir facilities. Experts agree that strip searches \"are the best way to maintain the security level necessary for\nkeeping serious and dangerous contraband out\" of detention facilities. Dodge, 282 F.Supp.2d at 49. The\nSupreme Court was convinced of the same thing in Bell, where it concluded that, given the \"serious security\ndangers\" present in detention facilities, a policy of conducting visual body-cavity searches on all inmates after\nany visit with a person from the outside is a reasonable way to stop the \"[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons,\nand other contraband\" that erode the orderly and safe administration of the facility. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct.\nat 1884.\nAffording considerable discretion to those who have the duty to run detention facilities safely is not an abdication\nof the judiciary's responsibility to protect the rights of incarcerated individuals. It is instead a recognition 00 what\n97\nthe Supreme Court has called a \"healthy sense of realism\" 00 that \"courts are ill equipped to deal with the\n97\nincreasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform.\" Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94\nS.Ct. 1800, 1807, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974),quoted in Bell, 441 U.S. at 548 n. 30, 99 S.Ct. at 1879 n. 30. To have\njudges second-guess detention facility officials about the need for procedures like strip searches is also in tension\nwith the principle that \"the operation of our correctional facilities is peculiarly the province of the Legislative and\nExecutive Branches of our Government, not the Judicial.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 548, 99 S.Ct. at 1879.\nFor these reasons, a strong argument can be made that the second part of the three-prong Bell analysis favors\npermitting detention facility administrators to adopt a strip search policy that applies to all arrestees being\nadmitted into the facility. If there is such a policy (the first prong) and if it is not applied in an abusive way (the\nthird prong), there will be no Fourth Amendment violation.\n\nD.\nOne other point is worth some discussion. In judging the constitutionality of strip searches for detainees, some\nother circuits draw a distinction between whether the person has been arrested on a felony charge or just for a\nmisdemeanor. Our circuit law is unclear about that. See ante at 1285 n. 1. In any event, I think a strong argument\ncan be made that such a distinction is without constitutional significance and finds no support in the real world of\ndetention.\nWhile Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.1989),Watt v. City of Richardson Police Department, 849 F.2d\n195 (5th Cir.1988),Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986),Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir.1984),\noverruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir.1999)(en banc), Mary Beth\nG. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983), and Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981), vary in\ndetail around the edges, the picture they paint is essentially the same: The arrestee is charged with committing a\nmisdemeanor or some lesser violation and, while being admitted to the detention facility, she is subjected to a\nstrip search pursuant to the facility's policy. The plaintiff sues the officials asserting that the search was\nunconstitutional because the guards did not have any reasonable basis for believing that she was hiding\n1291 contraband on her person. *1291See, e.g., Logan, 660 F.2d at 1009-11. In each cited case, the court of appeals\nholds that because the plaintiffs were \"minor offenders who were not inherently dangerous,\" Mary Beth G., 723\nF.2d at 1272, detention officials needed \"reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or other\ncontraband based on the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances\nof the arrest,\" Weber, 804 F.2d at 802. Because reasonable suspicion was lacking in each case, the search is\nheld to violate the Fourth Amendment.\nThe Supreme Court made no distinction in Bell\nbetween detainees based on whether they had been charged with misdemeanors or felonies. Instead, the policy\nthat the Court treated categorically, and upheld, provided that \"[i]nmates at all Bureau of Prison facilities,\nincluding the MCC, are required to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search\nconducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at\n1884. Among the \"[i]nmates at all Bureau of Prison facilities, including the MCC,\" were detainees facing only\nmisdemeanor charges, people incarcerated for contempt of court, and witnesses in protective custody who had\nnot been accused of doing anything wrong. See id. at 524 & n. 3, 99 S.Ct. at 1866 & n. 3. The MCC was hardly a\nfacility where all of the detainees were \"awaiting trial on serious federal charges,\" as some of the opinions of\nother circuits seem to indicate. It is on that basis that they distinguish what they describe as the \"exaggerated\"\nneed for strip searches at county facilities from the \"real\" need at federal facilities. See, e.g., Mary Beth G., 723\n[5]\nF.2d at 1272.\nThe need for strip searches at county jails is not exaggerated. Employees, visitors, and those who are\nthemselves detained face a real threat of violence, and administrators must be concerned on a daily basis with\nthe smuggling of contraband on the person of those accused of misdemeanors as well as those accused of\nfelonies. Dodge, 282 F.Supp.2d at 46-49. Even some of the circuits that have required reasonable suspicion for\nsearches of those arrested for misdemeanors concede that there have been instances where contraband was\nsmuggled into a jail by detainees facing only misdemeanor or lesser charges. See, e.g., Giles, 746 F.2d at 617.\nThen there is the fact that gang members commit misdemeanors as well as felonies. In one county jail, for\nexample, fifty percent of those being held on \"misdemeanor or lesser charges\" were gang members. Dodge, 282\nF.Supp.2d at 48 (citing figures from 2002). \"Gang members are often more violent, dangerous, and manipulative\nthan other inmates, regardless of the nature of the charges against them.\" Id. Not only that, but \"officials at a\ncounty jail ... usually know very little about the new inmates they receive or the security risks they present at the\n1292 time of their arrival.\" Id. Moreover, some gang members \"attempt to coerce family members or to coerce, cajole, \n*1292 or intimidate lesser violators into smuggling contraband into the facility.\" Id.\nThese reasons support the expert opinion that all of those who are to be detained in the general population of a\ndetention facility should be strip searched. See id. at 49. The Supreme Court has instructed us that detention\n\nfacility administrators \"should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and\npractices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional\nsecurity.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878. It has also explained that \"judicial deference is accorded not\nmerely because the administrator ordinarily will, as a matter of fact in a particular case, have a better grasp of his\ndomain than the reviewing judge, but also because the operation of our correctional facilities is peculiarly the\nprovince of the Legislative and Executive Branches of our Government, not the Judicial.\" Id. at 548, 99 S.Ct. at\n1879 (citing Martinez, 416 U.S. at 405, 94 S.Ct. at 1807). Decisions that carve out misdemeanor arrestees for\nspecial treatment do not seem to afford those who run detention facilities the \"wide-ranging deference\" the\nSupreme Court has mandated.\nE.\nTo summarize, the en banc Court is correct to note that the Supreme Court has never required reasonable\nsuspicion for strip searches of arrestees bound for the general jail population. Ante at 1278-79. The contrary\nreading of the Supreme Court's Bell decision that led to the holding in Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th\nCir.2001), is mistaken. When we have a case that squarely presents the issue for review, we ought to take it en\nbanc in order to reconsider our Wilson decision.\nF.\nJudge Barkett suggests that in the process of expressing in this opinion my views, which are critical of the\nposition she stated in the Wilson case, I have violated Article III. Post at 1296 n.1. Her theory is that the\nstatement of dicta in a judicial opinion \"intrudes upon the constitutional restraints on the jurisdiction of the federal\ncourts.\" Id. This novel theory apparently did not come to mind when she was writing the Wilson opinion broadly\nenough to invalidate a detention search policy in its entirety even though that case did not present the issue of\nwhether the policy was valid as applied to those arrested on felony charges. See Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1342-43.\nThe idea that dicta is unconstitutional also must not have come to her mind when Judge Barkett was authoring\nthe opinion of this Court in Aron v. United States, 291 F.3d 708 (11th Cir.2002). The facts in Aron were that the\npetitioner who sought the benefit of equitable tolling had exercised due diligence before the enactment of 28\nU.S.C. § 2255(4), which is the AEDPA's statute of limitations. Id. at 710. Nonetheless, Judge Barkett purported to\n\"hold\" for the Court that \"a petitioner's failure to exercise due diligence before AEDPA was enacted cannot\nsupport a finding that a petition fails to satisfy the timeliness requirement.\" Id. at 713. That was classic dicta, as I\npointed out in a concurring opinion in Aron. Id. at 716-18 (Carnes, J., concurring). It took this Court only two\nmonths to issue an opinion in another case, whose facts did present the pre-AEDPA diligence issue, recognizing\nthat statement on the issue in Aron was dicta and declining for that reason to be bound by it. Drew v. Dep't of\nCorrs., 297 F.3d 1278, 1290-92 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002).\nTo be fair, Judge Barkett is by no means the only member of this Court to sow dicta in her opinions. Indeed, when\n1293 *1293 one looks for it, dicta appears to be scattered across the opinions of this Court like wildflowers in a spring\nmeadow. A baker's dozen examples should suffice to prove the point: United States v. Williams, 340 F.3d 1231,\n1234-37 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that appellate courts are obliged to apply a \"due deference\" standard of review\nto a sentencing judge's application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts in a particular case, which was\nrecognized as dicta as it related to situations other than a challenge to the district court's grouping of a\ndefendant's offenses in United States v.

There are many examples, but an even ten will do: Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508\nU.S. 248, 256, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 2069, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993) (stating that restitution is a category of relief that is\ntypically available in equity, which was recognized as dicta in Great-W.

As one\ncommentator has correctly noted: \"Essentially, an advisory opinion consists of formal, binding advice from a court\nof law to other government officials or the general public in the absence of a live case or controversy pending\nbefore the court. This definition would not encompass other forms of judicial advice, including dicta, alternative\nholdings, and the like, which are admittedly in some sense precatory in nature.\" Ronald J. Krotoszyniski, Jr., \nConstitutional Flares: On Judges, Legislatures, and Dialogue, 83 Minn. L. Rev. 1, 8 n.27 (Nov.1998). The self-\ndescribed dicta in my concurring opinion does not purport to be \"binding advice.\" It is merely the statement of my\nviews at this time on an issue that was briefed and argued but is not being decided in this case. The opinion itself\nexplicitly acknowledges that these views bind no one, including me. Ante at 1284-85.\nStated somewhat differently, even if these views are seen as \"advisory\" in the colloquial sense, their expression\ndoes not violate Article III. See Evan Tsen Lee, Deconstitutionalizing Justiciability: The Example of Mootness, 105\nHarv. L. Rev. 603, 648-49 (Jan.1992) (\"It is clear that dicta 00 whether or not courts deem it to constitute an\n97\n`advisory opinion' 00 run afoul of no constitutional or jurisdictional barrier.\"); id. at 649 (\"[W]hether to engage in\n97\ndicta is a matter for the considered discretion of a court, and calling it an `advisory opinion' changes that not one\nwhit.\"). There are sound reasons why dicta is not binding, but there can also be good reasons for its occasional\nuse. See McDonald's Corp., 147 F.3d at 1314-15. Whether this is a proper occasion for the use of dicta is a\nprudential decision for the writing judge. It is not a constitutional issue.\nBARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\nI concur in the majority's conclusions that both the initiation and the manner of the strip searches in this case\nwere unconstitutional, and that qualified immunity should have been denied as to the manner of the search.\n1296 However, I believe that it was unquestionably clear in 1999 that an investigatory strip search conducted *1296\nwithout reasonable suspicion is unconstitutional. Thus, although it may make no practical difference here, I would\ndeny qualified immunity as it relates to the initiation of this strip search without reasonable suspicion.\nFinally, I would also note that the assertion that \"most\" members of the Court \"are uncertain that jailers are\nrequired to have a reasonable suspicion of weapons or contraband before strip searching ... arrestees bound for\nthe general jail population,\" is dicta in this case, which, as the majority concedes, \"provides no opportunity to\n[1]\ndecide the question. . . .\"\n\nStephens Is Not Entitled to Qualified Immunity for the Initiation of the\nStrip Search\nAs an initial matter, the majority's distinction between the initiation of the strip search and the manner of the\nsearch appears to have no practical effect here. The initiation of the strip search is certainly one of the factors\npertaining to the overall constitutionality of the search, as is the manner of the search, but it should not be\naddressed separately for purposes of a qualified immunity analysis. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99\nS.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (describing a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis which takes into account\n\"the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted\"). However, assuming the appropriateness of such a distinction, the law was clearly\nestablished through Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), and United\nStates v. Himmelwright, 551 F.2d 991 (5th Cir.1977), that the initiation of a strip search without reasonable\nsuspicion was unconstitutional. Thus, Stephens was not entitled to qualified immunity for either the initiation of\nthe search or the manner in which it was conducted.\nIn Schmerber, the Court considered whether an arresting officer violated the Fourth Amendment by extracting an\narrestee's blood without a warrant after validly arresting him for driving under the influence. See Schmerber, 384\nU.S. at 758-59, 86 S.Ct. 1826. The Court noted that searches incident to arrest are generally valid, but explained\nthat \"the mere fact of a lawful arrest\" was not conclusive in this case. Id. at 769, 86 S.Ct. 1826. In particular, the\npolicy considerations which support the validity of searches incident to arrest \"have little applicability with respect\nto searches involving intrusions beyond the body's surface.\" Id. (emphasis added). The Court explained its\nreasoning as follows:\nThe interests in human dignity and privacy which the Fourth Amendment protects forbid any such\nintrusions on the mere chance that desired evidence might be obtained. In the absence of a clear\nindication that in fact such evidence will be found, these fundamental human interests require law\n1297 officers to suffer the risk that such evidence may *1297 disappear unless there is an immediate\nsearch.\nId. at 769-70, 86 S.Ct. 1826.\nThe Schmerber Court did proceed to find that based on the \"special facts\" of that case, the searching officer\n\"might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency\" because the percentage of alcohol\nin the arrestee's blood would have diminished before the officer could have obtained a warrant, especially\nbecause the investigation of the accident scene and the trip to the hospital had already delayed the blood test. Id.\nBoth Schmerber and this case concern unusually invasive investigatory body searches incident to arrest 00\n97\nindeed, a strip search like this represents an even more invasive and degrading procedure than a blood draw 00\n97\nand in both cases the object of the search was ostensibly to discover evidence retained within an arrestee's body.\nUnlike the officers in Schmerber, however, Stephens cannot argue that this search was precipitated by any\nemergency. Nor did he have any reason to believe that the strip search would reveal relevant evidence, while the \nSchmerber officers did have reason to believe they would find alcohol in the arrestee's blood. See id. at 768-69,\n86 S.Ct. 1826. Thus, the features of the Schmerber search that saved it from violating the Fourth Amendment are\nabsent in this case.\nMoreover, even in border searches there was a clearly established minimum requirement of reasonable suspicion\nfor investigatory strip searches by 1999. In United States v. Himmelwright, the former Fifth Circuit held that the\nFourth Amendment required reasonable suspicion before an investigatory strip search at the border, finding that\n\"the `reasonable suspicion' standard is flexible enough to afford the full measure of protection which the fourth\namendment commands.\" 551 F.2d at 995. The court \"hasten[ed] to add that `reasonable suspicion' in this context\nincludes a requirement that customs officials have cause to suspect that contraband exists in the particular place\nwhich the officials decide to search.\" Id.; see also United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 541,\n105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985).\n\nIf, before 1999, the Fourth Amendment imposed a reasonable suspicion requirement on border strip searches,\nwhere authority to search is less constrained than it is in an ordinary domestic search incident to arrest, it is\nunquestionable that at least the same degree of suspicion was required to conduct the strip searches in this\ncase. Schmerber and Himmelwright clearly established before 1999 that reasonable suspicion was required to\nconduct an investigatory strip search. Based on the facts of this case, no reasonable officer could have believed\nthat a strip search was justified simply because the arrestees were nervous when stopped by the police and\nclaimed to be lost.\n[1] Evans later plead guilty to reckless driving and does not challenge that plea on appeal.\n[2] By this time, Stephens was joined by an officer from the Pike County Sheriff's Office.\n[3] Stephens did not know what offense had led to the outstanding arrest warrant. The parties agree that the\nDetre Jordan in the warrant was not Plaintiff-Appellee Jordan.\n[4] According to Evans, the chokehold occurred after Evans was in the room and after Jordan described the order\nto take off his underwear as \"some bullshit and I ain't going to pull my drawers.\"\n[5] Plaintiffs describe the baton-like object as a cold, black cylindrical, object. We use the term \"baton-like object\"\nor \"baton\" to describe whatever Officer Stephens allegedly used to hit and probe Plaintiffs.\n[6] Officer Stephens tells a completely different story: he did not perform a pat down search outside the jail; he\ndid not place Evans and Jordan in a supply closet, but a trustee cell. He recalls asking Evans and Jordan to take\noff their clothing, but not touching or taunting them. Officer Stephens also says that neither Plaintiff resisted the\nstrip search.\n[7] Plaintiffs' counsel urge us to accept a mixed description of events. Plaintiffs specifically argue that we should\ncredit Officer Stephens's statement that Jordan in no way resisted or protested the strip search, but that we\nshould also believe Plaintiffs' depiction of the manner of the search, including the choke hold. For summary\njudgment, we believe the evidence of the nonmovant (at least when, as here, the nonmovant's testimony is not\ndoubtlessly incredible and the movant seems competent to give testimony).\n[8] We stress that we are not deciding that this standard applies to strip searches for other purposes, such as,\nsearches conducted by jailers on arrestees bound for a jail's general population as part of a safety or security\nroutine of the jail. In this case, we are also not dealing with a search for weapons that might pose a threat to the\nsafety of law officers or others.\n[9] By the way, we note that Officer Stephens testified that he believed the legal standard needed for the search\nwas that of reasonable suspicion. Of course, Officer Stephens's subjective intentions and beliefs in conducting\nthe strip search are immaterial to the Fourth Amendment analysis. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397,\n109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). Ulterior motives will not make an otherwise lawful search\nunlawful.\n[10] Officer Stephens acknowledged that he did not suspect Plaintiffs had weapons in their possession. This view\nwas the objectively reasonable one. At his deposition, Stephens agreed that whatever reasonable suspicion he\nhad, it was for drugs and \"never for weapons.\"\n[11] Today, we do not say that body cavity searches that penetrate orifices are per se unconstitutional. See, e.g.,\nIsby v. Duckworth, 175 F.3d 1020, No. 97-3705, 1999 WL 236880, *2 (7th Cir. Mar. 11, 1999) (unpublished).\n[12] In the patrol car, Officer Stephens said that he was \"judge and jury\" in Zebulon and that he would decide\nwhether Plaintiffs could make a phone call from the jail. He also told Plaintiffs that he would \"send you niggers\naway for a long time.\" Once in the room where the strip search occurred, Stephens called Evans a smart aleck\nand a smart ass. He told Jordan that he didn't like \"you boys in my town. I don't want niggers here anyway.\"\nStephens told another officer allegedly in the room that Evans and Jordan made \"my jail cell smell[ ] like\n[Plaintiffs],\" and that he would send Plaintiffs to prison for the rest of their lives. While he penetrated Plaintiffs'\n\nanuses with the baton, he said that Plaintiffs had \"better get used to this, this is how it is in the big house, this is\nwhere you [sic] getting ready to go. Somebody is going to be butt fucking you for the next twenty years, all\nbecause you got a smart mouth.\" \nWe understand that law officers sometimes use harsh words as a kind of verbal \"shock and awe\" tactic to deter\narrestees from causing trouble that might cause violent injury to the officer or someone else. We do not say this\nkind of practice is inherently unlawful or commonly will help to cause accompanying searches or seizures to be\nunlawful. In this case, Plaintiffs contend they were under police control and in custody and posed no threat to\nOfficer Stephens who, at the time of the search, was at a jail and in the company of another officer.\n[13] Plaintiffs argue that Stephens acted outside his authority when he strip searched Plaintiffs, because the\npolice chief verbally prohibited Stephens from performing strip searches. We disagree. Chief Lummis's instruction\nwas limited to roadside strip searches and did not address other strip searches.\n[14] When case law is needed, only cases from the Supreme Court, our Circuit or the highest court of the\npertinent state clearly establish the law in the Circuit for qualified immunity analysis. Marsh, 268 F.3d at 1033 n.\n10.\n[1] Some of the other circuits, at least, recognize that reasonable suspicion is not required where the arrestee\nbeing detained is charged with a felony or a violent crime. See, e.g., Masters, 872 F.2d at 1255 (distinguishing \nDufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084 (6th Cir.1983), where the court upheld a strip search policy for a pretrial detainee\ncharged with a felony without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, from this case where the § 1983 plaintiff\nwas arrested on a warrant for failure to appear in court); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272 (distinguishing the\nconstitutionality of strip searches where there is no probable cause or reasonable suspicion for pretrial detainees\nheld on \"inherently dangerous\" crimes from the unconstitutionality of strip searches of \"minor offenders\"). \nPart of this Court's opinion in Wilson, by contrast, might be read to apply to those charged with felonies as well as\nthose charged with only misdemeanors, see Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1342-43, although that probably would be dicta\nsince the facts of the case did not present the issue as it applies to felony-charged detainees, see Watts v.\nBellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 316 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.2003) (\"Whatever their opinions say, judicial decisions\ncannot make law beyond the facts of the cases in which those decisions are announced.\"); United States v.\nAguillard, 217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\"The holdings of a prior decision can reach only as\nfar as the facts and circumstances presented to the court in the case which produced that decision.\" (citations\nand internal marks omitted)).\n[2] The Supreme Court described the MCC strip search as follows: \"If the inmate is a male, he must lift his\ngenitals and bend over to spread his buttocks for visual inspection. The vaginal and anal cavities of female\ninmates also are visually inspected. The inmate is not touched by security personal [sic] at any time during the \nvisual search procedure.\" Id. at 558 n. 39, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 n. 39.\n[3] None of the decisions in this area, including our own, seem to distinguish between strip searches in general\nand \"visual body-cavity inspections\" as the procedure was described in Bell. I don't either.\n[4] A second reason for strip searches is that they allow officials to identify gang members, who often have tattoos\nor identifying marks on their bodies. Finding the gang members early puts the officials on notice that these people\nare serious security risks and should be separated from the general population where they can cause harm.\nOtherwise, all the detention facility has to go on is the crime for which the individual is charged, which may not\nreflect the danger the person poses. Id. at 47-48.\n[5] The facility involved in the Bell case was not some special sort of seething cauldron of criminality. The\nSupreme Court described the facility this way: \"MCC differs markedly from the familiar image of a jail; there are\nno barred cells, dank, colorless corridors, or clanging steel gates. It was intended to include the most advanced\nand innovative features of modern design of detention facilities.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 525, 99 S.Ct. at 1866. In the\nthree years MCC strip searched all inmates before the trial in Bell, there was only one instance of smuggled\ncontraband. Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. Yet, the Supreme Court found that \"serious security dangers\" warranted\nthe strip search policy at all federal detention facilities, including MCC. Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85.\n\n[1] Article III requires that we consider only those \"questions presented in an adversary context and in a form\nhistorically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.\" Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 95, 88\nS.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). Thus, staking out a position that reasonable suspicion is not required for strip\nsearches under circumstances not at issue in this case, as Judge Carnes does, intrudes upon the constitutional\nrestraints on the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Even the majority's suggestion that \"most\" members of the\ncourt are uncertain about the reasonable suspicion requirement should occur in a factually relevant case where\nresolution of that question is necessary to the outcome of the dispute.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Plaintiffs-appellees Peter Evans and Detree\nJordan contend in their action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 that Stephens unconstitutionally subjected them to a strip\nsearch and body cavity search after arresting them on January 22, 1999, and that Stephens conducted the\nsearches in an abusive and unreasonable manner.\nI. BACKGROUND\n[1]\nA. Factual Background\nOn the evening of January 22, 1999, Peter Evans and Detree Jordan were driving from Atlanta to Statesboro,\nwhere the two were students at Georgia Southern University. Evans was the driver and Jordan the passenger of\nthe vehicle, which was a rental. Both are black males in their twenties. The two got lost, mistakenly traveling\nsouth on Interstate 85 towards Columbus rather than Interstate 75, which leads to Macon and Interstate 16,\nwhich in turn leads southeast to Statesboro. When they realized their mistake, Evans and Jordan pulled off the\nhighway to a gas station and got directions to Macon via secondary highways, cutting east across middle\nGeorgia.\nAt approximately 8 o'clock that evening, Zebulon Police Officer Denis Stephens clocked Evans's and Jordan's car\n[2]\ntraveling 72 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. zone. Stephens pulled the car to the side of the road  and asked Evans about\ntheir destination. After hearing Evans's explanation of where he and Jordan were going and how they got where\nthey were, Stephens ordered the men to exit the car. Evans consented to a search of the car and to a pat down.\nStephens searched the car for about five minutes. On the video tape, Stephens later says that he found a beer\ncan in the car but he did not display any can in front of the video camera, though it was Stephens's usual habit to\ndisplay such items. Evans and Jordan assert that Stephens did not, in fact, find a beer can. Several times during\n\nthe course of the traffic stop, Evans put a piece of candy in his mouth. Each time, Stephens asked him to remove\nit.\n488 Stephens issued Evans a citation for speeding. He then asked Evans to submit *488 to a chemical analysis of the\nalcohol content in his breath. Evans replied that he wanted to speak to his lawyer, and Stephens placed Evans\nunder arrest for D.U.I. refusal and for speeding. Stephens requested computer checks of the men and their\nvehicle. The check returned an outstanding parole violation warrant for a black male with the last name \"Jordan\"\nand a birthday matching that on Jordan's license. Based on these matches, Stephens placed Jordan under arrest\n[3]\nfor violating parole.  During a pat down of Jordan, Stephens says that he found a beer pop top. The pop top is\nnot visible in the tape and Stephens did not display it for the camera. As with the alleged beer can, Evans and\nJordan claim Stephens did not in fact find a pop top.\nStephens placed Evans and Jordan in his patrol car and a tow truck was summoned. While waiting for the tow\ntruck, Stephens again searched the interior of the car and the trunk. He and the other officers also searched the\nground and roadside around the rental car. When the tow truck arrived, Stephens transported Evans and Jordan\nto the Pike County Jail.\nAt the jail, Stephens handcuffed Evans and Jordan to a bench outside of the booking area while he spoke with\nPike County Sheriff's Deputy Andre Dawson, who was staffing the booking area. Stephens then took Jordan into\na utility closet and pushed him up against the wall, telling him to keep his hands on the wall. Stephens patted\nJordan down and then ordered him to remove his shoes and shirt. Stephens searched those articles of clothing\nand ordered Jordan to place his hands back against the wall. He then ordered Jordan to lower his pants. When\nJordan turned around and protested that this was unnecessary, Stephens placed Jordan in a choke hold and\npushed him back against the wall. At this point another officer pushed Evans into the room, causing him to\n[4]\nstumble into Jordan, and both men fell to the ground.  The officers picked the men up and pushed them back\n[5]\nagainst the wall. Stephens struck Jordan in the side with a slender black object,  and the other officer placed\nJordan in a choke hold and held him against the wall. Stephens then pulled Jordan's underwear down and placed\nthe slender black object between Jordan's buttocks, jabbing his anus. Jordan, startled, jumped, and the officers\n[6]\nlaughed and giggled. Stephens ordered Jordan to use his hands to spread his buttocks.  Stephens repeated\n[7]\nthese actions on Evans, placing the object between his buttocks, then used it to lift each man's genitals.\n489 Stephens *489 then ordered the men to replace their clothing, clapping and counting to hurry them. Jordan and\nEvans were rushed back to the booking area before they were able to put their shoes and shirts back on. During\nthe strip search and cavity search, Stephens made racially derogatory remarks and, while using the slender\n[8]\nmetal object on the two men, referred to prison rape.\nEvans and Jordan were issued jump-suits and placed in the general population overnight. The next morning\nJordan was released, and he returned to post bail for Evans. Evans later pled guilty to reckless driving and the\nD.U.I.-related charges were dropped. Evans and Jordan testified that they have not suffered any physical injuries\nas a result of the incident, and neither testified that the slender object used by Stephens penetrated his rectal\n[9]\ncavity. Both testified that they now suffer from periodic anxiety, insomnia, and depression.\nB. Procedural History\nEvans and Jordan filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Officer Stephens, the chief of the Zebulon Police\nDepartment, and the city of Zebulon, alleging violations of their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures based on their arrests and the subsequent searches. All defendants moved\nfor summary judgment, which the district court granted to the city and to the police chief. The district court\ngranted Stephens's motion for summary judgment on the arrest claim, finding that Stephens had probable cause\n[10]\nto arrest Evans for speeding and had probable cause to arrest Jordan for a parole violation.\n490 The court denied Stephens's motion for summary judgment on the search claim, *490 holding that the plaintiffs\nhad alleged an unconstitutional search, conducted without reasonable suspicion and in an unconstitutionally\nintrusive manner. The court held that Stephens was not entitled to qualified immunity for the search as alleged.\n\nThe court held that Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), and Justice v. City of\nPeachtree, 961 F.2d 188 (11th Cir.1992), clearly established that, absent reasonable suspicion, a strip search\ninvolving physical contact and use of an object to probe the subject's anal and genital areas was unconstitutional.\nStephens brings this interlocutory appeal challenging the district court's denial of his motion for summary\njudgment, arguing that the appellees have not stated a violation of their constitutional rights and that he is entitled\nto qualified immunity. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2817, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); \nDalrymple v. Reno, 334 F.3d 991 (11th Cir.2003) (allowing interlocutory appeal of denial of qualified immunity).\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nWe review a district court's order denying summary judgment de novo. Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1342\n(11th Cir. 2001). We must first decide whether the plaintiffs have alleged a constitutional violation and, if so,\nwhether the constitutional right alleged to have been violated was clearly established at the time of the alleged\nviolation. Id. (citing McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1254 (11th Cir.1999)). A government official is entitled to\nqualified immunity for liability arising out of his discretionary actions unless those actions violated a clearly\nestablished federal right of which a reasonable person would have known. Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739,\n122 S.Ct. 2508, 2515, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727,\n2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)).\nThe Supreme Court has recently articulated the appropriate standard: \"the salient question ... is whether the state\nof the law ... [at the relevant time] gave the ... [officers] fair warning that their alleged treatment of Hope was\nunconstitutional.\" Hope, 536 U.S. at 741, 122 S.Ct. at 2516. \"The relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining\nwhether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was\nunlawful in the situation he confronted.\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d\n272 (2001).\nIII. DISCUSSION\nThis appeal presents two questions regarding the legality of the searches. The first is whether the strip search\nwas justified in its inception, and the second is whether the search was conducted in a constitutional manner.\nEach question also raises the issue of qualified immunity. We will address the inception of the search first.\nA. Inception of Search\nArrestees who are to be detained in the general jail population can constitutionally be subjected to a strip search\nonly if the search is supported by reasonable suspicion that such a search will reveal weapons or contraband. \nWilson, 251 F.3d at 1343. Stephens argues that he had reasonable suspicion to believe that Evans and Jordan\nwere concealing drugs. We conclude, however, that these searches were not supported by reasonable suspicion.\nStephens advances a myriad of factors that, he argues, support a reasonable suspicion that Evans and Jordan\nwere concealing drugs beneath their clothing or in their body cavities, but none of these factors, alone or in\n491 combination, provide such *491 reasonable suspicion. Stephens's arguments boil down to the following: two\nyoung men were speeding through rural Georgia in a rental car in the evening and, when stopped by law\n[11]\nenforcement officials, appeared nervous and claimed to be lost.  These factors are not sufficiently indicative of\ndrug activity to support more than \"an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch\" that they were\n[12]\nconcealing drugs. Brent v. Ashley, 247 F.3d 1294, 1300 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting United States v. Sokolow, 490\nU.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)).\nThe instant facts are insufficient to permit a strip search involving contact with the anus and genitals. The\njustification required to conduct a search increases with the degree of intrusiveness of a search, see Justice, 961\nF.2d at 192, and the scope of the search must be commensurate with the officer's reasonable suspicions, see \nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1878, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Cf. Justice, 961 F.2d at 194 (holding\nthat reasonable suspicion to strip search an arrestee in custody was supported by: reasonable suspicion of\n\nregular drinking and drug activity in the area; officer saw driver of vehicle hand something to the girl searched;\nthe girl appeared extremely nervous; the officer thought females were more likely to conceal drugs on their\nperson; this girl had a friend whose mother suspected that they were using drugs; and based on their training and\nexperience and these circumstances the officers suspected that the girl was concealing what the driver handed\nher and that it was drugs); Kraushaar v. Flanigan, 45 F.3d 1040, 1046 (7th Cir.1995) (holding that reasonable\nsuspicion to strip search an arrestee supported by furtive hand movements suggesting an attempt to hide\ncontraband in his pants); Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 (noting documented attempts by inmates to\nsmuggle contraband into prison facilities by concealment in a body cavity). In contrast to the cited cases,\nStephens observed no behavior by the appellees consistent with an attempt to hide anything beneath their\nclothing during or after the traffic stop, and the appellees, who presumably did not anticipate being arrested that\nnight, had no apparent motive at the time of the traffic stop to conceal contraband underneath their clothing for\nsmuggling into the jail.\nThe record also reveals that both Evans and Jordan were subjected to a pat-down search at the scene of the\ntraffic stop and again when they arrived at the jail. Stephens conducted two searches of the car during the traffic\nstop, and he and the other officers at the scene conducted a thorough search of the ground and roadside around\nthe car. These searches revealed, at most, a beer can and a pop top. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable\nto the appellees, these searches revealed nothing. As we have noted in the border inspection context,\nincreasingly thorough searches that fail to reveal contraband or incriminating evidence tend to dispel reasonable\n492 suspicions, not heighten *492 them. See Brent, 247 F.3d at 1301; cf. Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678, 682\n(11th Cir.2000) (holding that firearm found in an arrestee's car provided reasonable suspicion that she might be\nconcealing weapons underneath her clothing).\nStephens is entitled to qualified immunity, however, because as of January 22, 1999, the law was not clearly\nestablished that an arrestee could not constitutionally be strip searched under the conditions alleged. In Wilson,\nwe granted qualified immunity to a Shelby County, Alabama, sheriff for his security policy of strip searching all\narrestees detained in the general jail population, regardless of the presence or absence of reasonable suspicion\nthat an arrestee concealed weapons or contraband. We held that Bell and Justice did not clearly establish that\nreasonable suspicion was required to perform those searches. 251 F.3d at 1344-46. Because the law was\nunclear until 2001 when Wilson was decided, Stephens did not have fair warning in 1999 that reasonable\nsuspicion was required to conduct a strip search or body cavity search of an arrestee detained in the general jail\n[13]\npopulation. Therefore, Stephens is entitled to qualified immunity for initiating these suspicion-less searches.\nB. Manner of the Search\nThe appellees also asserted that the manner in which the searches were conducted violated their constitutional\nrights. In Bell, the Supreme Court explained that\n[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment ... requires a balancing of the need for\nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must\nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it was conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\n441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. The highly intrusive nature of strip searches and body cavity searches is\nwidely recognized, fraught as they are with the inherent potential to degrade, demean, dehumanize, and\nhumiliate. Justice, 961 F.2d at 192. There is a danger that the search will be conducted in \"an abusive fashion.\" \nBell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. \"Such an abuse cannot be condoned. The search must be conducted in a\nreasonable manner.\" Id.\nCourts considering the reasonableness of the manner in which strip searches and body cavity searches of\narrestees and prison inmates are conducted have looked at factors including the degree of privacy afforded the\nperson subjected to the search, whether the search was performed by someone of the same sex as the person\nsearched, the hygienic conditions of the search, whether the search involved physical contact, and whether the\n[14]\nsearch was performed in a professional manner. See, e.g., Leverette v. Bell, 247 F.3d 160, 168 (4th Cir.2001)\n\n(holding that visual body cavity search of prison employee was performed in a \"sensitive and professional\n493 manner\"); Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 *493 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that private, visual inspection\nof arrestee by same-sex officer was reasonable); Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356, 359-62 (4th Cir.2001) (holding\nthat public inspection, in front of plaintiff's house and observed by her five children and by her neighbors, by\nopposite-sex officer involving slight genital penetration with ungloved hand was unreasonable); Skurstenis v.\nJones, 236 F.3d 678, 683-84 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that inspection in a private place of arrestee for body lice by\nan opposite-sex medical professional was reasonable); Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694, 700 (9th Cir.1997)\n(contrasting the reasonable visual body cavity search of an inmate with unreasonable contact searches of female\ninmates performed by non-medical personnel in unhygienic conditions and in the presence of male police\nofficers); Del Raine v. Williford, 32 F.3d 1024, 1041 (7th Cir.1994) (contrasting the reasonable digital rectal exam\nof a prisoner by medical personnel in that case with other searches involving a lack of hygiene or trained medical\npersonnel); Justice, 961 F.2d at 193 (holding that non-contact strip search of an arrestee by two same-sex\nofficers in a private room was reasonable). The manner in which searches are conducted may be justified in\nsome circumstances by emergency conditions. See, e.g., Elliott v. Lynn, 38 F.3d 188, 191-92 (5th Cir.1994)\n(holding that emergency prison conditions justified conducting visual body cavity searches of inmates under\nsemi-private conditions); Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441, 447 (1st Cir.1991) (per curiam) (holding that semi-\nprivate conditions of visual body cavity searches of inmates and presence of opposite-sex officers can be justified\nby emergency prison conditions).\nConsidering these factors, we are persuaded that the appellees have testified in deposition to details with regard\nto the strip searches that, if believed by a jury, could demonstrate that the searches were performed in an\nunreasonable and unconstitutional manner. Although Stephens testified to a much different search, we relate the\nfacts according to the appellees' account, as we must in this summary judgment posture. Evans and Jordan were\nnot searched in a private place, but were searched in the same room and at the same time. They were shoved\nagainst the wall without apparent provocation. When the men did not comply with Stephens's orders to his liking,\nthey were subjected to choke holds. A slender metal object was pushed between their buttocks, contacting each\nman's anus. This contact search was not performed by medical personnel, and the same slender object was\nused to touch each man's anus and genitals without any apparent sanitary safeguards. A jury could find that the\nsearches were not performed with sensitivity and professionalism, but rather were performed in a degrading,\nhumiliating and terrifying fashion, punctuated by taunting, threats, rough contact and abusive language unjustified\nby the surrounding circumstances or the conduct of the appellees and unnecessarily exacerbating the degrading\nand terrifying nature of the searches.\nHaving determined the existence of triable issues of fact with regard to the constitutionality of the manner in\nwhich the searches were conducted, we must now determine if triable issues of fact remain with regard to\nStephens's qualified immunity defense. The defense of qualified immunity will entitle Stephens to summary\njudgment unless the law was clearly established, either by materially similar precedent, Vinyard v. Wilson, 311\nF.3d 1340, 1351 (11th Cir.2002); Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188, 1198 (11th Cir.2002), or by general legal\nprinciples that apply with obvious clarity to the facts of this case, Hope, 536 U.S. at 741, 122 S.Ct. at 2516; Marsh\n494 v. Butler County, 268 F.3d 1014, 1032 n. 9 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc), that the manner *494 in which the searches\nwere alleged to have been conducted violated the appellees' constitutional rights.\nWe readily conclude that there are no materially similar precedents that provided Stephens fair warning of the\nunconstitutionality of his conduct. The only two cases considering the manner in which a strip search was\nperformed decided at the time of the searches at issue and which could have provided fair warning to Stephens\n[15]\nare Bell and Justice.  While the Bell Court cautioned that \"on occasion a security guard may conduct the\nsearch in an abusive fashion,\" 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885 (citation omitted), the Court provided no factual\ncontext to give definition to what constitutes an abusive search. Justice held that a strip search conducted in a\nminimally intrusive manner was reasonable, but did not indicate what might constitute an unreasonable search.\nThe appellees argue that the force used during the search was clearly unconstitutional, relying on cases denying\npolice officers qualified immunity for claims of excessive force used to effectuate an arrest. See Vinyard v.\nWilson, 311 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2002); Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188 (11th Cir.2002); Slicker v. Jackson, 215\nF.3d 1225 (11th Cir.2000); Priester v. City of Riviera Beach, 208 F.3d 919 (11th Cir.2000); Smith v. Mattox, 127\nF.3d 1416 (11th Cir.1997). The appellees argue that these cases are materially similar to the facts of this case. In\n\neach of the cited cases, unnecessary force was used against a suspect or arrestee after the person was\nobviously subdued or secured and when no reasonable officer could believe that he or she posed a threat to\nanyone's safety or presented a risk of flight. These cases involve marked factual dissimilarities from the case at\nissue.\nThese marked differences are highlighted by the analysis applied in these excessive force cases. The excessive\nforce analysis considers (1) the severity of the crime at issue, (2) whether the suspect poses an immediate threat\nto the safety of the officers or others, and (3) whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to\nevade arrest. Lee, 284 F.3d at 1197-98 (citing Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104\nL.Ed.2d 443 (1989)). This analysis, tailored to the arrest context, does not provide sufficient guidance to the\nreasonableness of the manner in which a strip search is conducted. The severity of the arrestee's suspected\ncrime, for example, may be relevant to the justification for the search, but is probably irrelevant to the\nreasonableness of the manner in which the search is conducted. The significant factual and doctrinal differences\nbetween the cases relied upon by the appellees and the facts of this case demonstrate that the cited cases are\n[16]\nnot materially similar for purposes of the qualified immunity analysis.\n495 *495 The appellees argue that the conduct alleged was so egregious that it obviously violated Bell's general\nwarning against abusive searches even though this statement in Bell was not tied to any factual context. See \nHope, 536 U.S. at 741, 122 S.Ct. at 2516 (\"[A] general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law\nmay apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question, even though the very action in question has not\npreviously been held unlawful.\") (quotation, citation and alteration omitted); cf. Willingham v. Loughnan, 321 F.3d\n1299, 1303 (11th Cir. 2003) (\"[A]n official's conduct could run so far afoul of constitutional protections that fair\nwarning was present even when particularized caselaw was absent.\") (citing Priester, 208 F.3d at 926).\nWe hold that the general legal principles stated in Bell and Justice do not apply with such obvious clarity to the\nfacts of this case that no reasonable officer could have believed that the manner in which the strip searches of\nthe appellees were performed was constitutional. Those cases state the proposition that a search must be\nconducted reasonably, Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884; Justice, 961 F.2d at 191, and not abusively, Bell,\n441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. The principle of reasonableness, as the Court has noted, \"is not capable of\nprecise definition or mechanical application.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. This principle does not apply with\nobvious clarity here, where a reasonable officer could have concluded that the manner in which the searches\nwere conducted did not violate the Constitution.\nEven under the appellees' version of the facts, an objectively reasonable officer could have concluded that the\nconduct alleged here with respect to two resistant subjects did not violate the subjects' constitutional rights.\nJordan testified that when Stephens ordered him to remove his clothes, he removed his hands from the wall,\nturned around to face Stephens, and protested. A reasonable officer in these circumstances could have\ninterpreted this as resistance to the search, and could have reasonably believed that the application of some\nforce, including a choke hold, to facilitate the search would not violate the Constitution. Cf. Post, 7 F.3d at 1559.\nThe law was not clearly established at the time of these searches that Stephens's use of the slender object would\nbe unconstitutional. We have never held that contact searches are per se unreasonable, and in fact upheld a\ncontact strip search two years after these searches occurred. Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 681, 683 (holding that strip\nsearch of arrestee by medical personnel who ran his fingers through the arrestee's pubic hair to check for body\nlice was conducted reasonably). Other decisions issued before these searches occurred had approved searches\ninvolving not only contact, but also rectal penetration, as reasonable. See, e.g., Del Raine, 32 F.3d at 1041\n(digital rectal exam of an inmate by medical personnel); Daughtery v. Harris, 476 F.2d 292, 295 (10th Cir.1973)\n(rectal searches of inmates by medical personnel). In light of these decisions, we cannot conclude that Stephens\nhad fair warning that the alleged contact during the searches would be unconstitutional.\nStephens also lacked fair warning that his verbal abuse could violate the Constitution. Several courts have noted\nthat verbal abuse does not usually rise to a level of a constitutional violation. This Court, for example, has held\nthat verbal taunts by other inmates do not pose a serious risk to the prisoner's health or safety under the Eighth\n496 and Fourteenth Amendments. Edwards v. Gilbert, 867 F.2d 1271, 1274 n. 1 *496 (11th Cir.1989). Cf. McFadden\nv. Lucas, 713 F.2d 143, 146 (5th Cir.1983) (threatening language and gestures of a corrections officer do not\n\ngenerally violate an inmate's Eighth Amendment rights). Other courts have held that verbal threats and\nharassment by a government official do not generally violate substantive due process. King v. Olmsted County,\n117 F.3d 1065, 1067 (8th Cir.1997); Robertson v. Plano City, 70 F.3d 21, 24 (5th Cir.1995); Pittsley v. Warish, 927\nF.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir.1991). Some courts have applied this principle to the arrest context. See Hopson v.\nFredericksen, 961 F.2d 1374, 1378-79 (8th Cir. 1992) (officer's statement during an arrest that he would knock\nthe arrestee's teeth out and his use of a racial slur did not violate the Fourth Amendment); Keyes v. City of\nAlbany, 594 F.Supp. 1147, 1155 (N.D.N.Y.1984) (\"verbal abuse, including vile language and racial epithets\"\ndirected at bystanders during an arrest did not violate their constitutional rights). In light of this caselaw treating\nverbal abuse, even vile language and racial epithets, as insufficient to constitute a constitutional violation, we\ncannot conclude that it was clearly established that Stephens's taunts and threats of prison rape might so\n[17]\nexacerbate the intrusiveness of the strip search as to violate the appellees' constitutional rights.\nIn holding that a reasonable officer would not be compelled, simply from the general principles stated in Bell and \nJustice, to conclude that the manner in which these searches were conducted was unconstitutional, we\nemphasize that the appellees have not asserted that they suffered any physical injury as a result of the searches,\nand they have not asserted any penetration by the slender object. While the appellees have alleged a search that\na jury could conclude was unreasonably humiliating, degrading, and terrifying, cf. Justice, 961 F.2d at 192, the\nalleged conduct does not go \"so far beyond the hazy border\" between reasonable and unreasonable conduct that\nevery reasonable officer would have to know that it violated the Constitution. Lee, 284 F.3d at 1199.\nIn sum, under the circumstances here 00 the application of some physical force to keep apparently resistant\n97\narrestees against the wall during the search, and anal and genital contact with a slender object, all accompanied\nby verbal abuse but in the absence of any injury or anal penetration 00 the law was not clearly established at the\n97\n[18]\ntime that the searches would violate appellees' rights under the Fourth Amendment.  The doctrine of qualified\nimmunity recognizes \"the need to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related\npublic interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of public authority,\" Marsh, 268 F.3d at 1031 n. 8 (quoting \nButz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 506, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2911, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978)). This freedom of action is\nespecially important in the sensitive area of prison security, see Bell, 441 U.S. at 559-60, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85.\nWhile we recognize the intrusive nature of the searches the appellees claim to have been subjected to, we are\nunable to conclude that Stephens had fair warning of the unconstitutionality of such conduct under the\ncircumstances.\n497  IV. CONCLUSION\n*497\nThe evidence adduced by the appellees and the reasonable inferences therefrom, if believed by a jury, could\nsupport the conclusion that Stephens subjected Evans and Jordan to a strip search and body cavity search\nwithout reasonable suspicion that these searches would reveal contraband and that Stephens conducted those\nsearches in an unreasonable manner, in violation of Evans's and Jordan's Fourth Amendment rights. However,\nbecause the law was not clearly established that reasonable suspicion was required to conduct the searches at\nissue, Stephens is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity for claims based on the\ninitiation of those searches. Also, because the law was not clearly established at the time that a search could not\nconstitutionally be conducted in the manner alleged, Stephens is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of\nqualified immunity for those claims based on the manner in which the search was conducted.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the district court holding that the search was unconstitutional, both with respect to\nthe initiation of the searches and with respect to the manner in which the searches were conducted, is affirmed.\nBut the judgment of the district court holding that Stephens is not entitled to qualified immunity, both with respect\nto the initiation of the searches and with respect to the manner thereof, is reversed. This case is therefore\nremanded with instructions to enter judgment for Stephens.\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\nPROPST, District Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\nI respectfully dissent as to Part III. B. of the majority opinion. The majority concludes that a jury could find that\n\"the searches were performed in an unreasonable and unconstitutional manner.\" The majority further concludes,\nhowever, that Stephens is entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiffs' claims in that regard \"because the law\nwas not clearly established at the time that a search could not constitutionally be conducted in the manner\nalleged....\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) established the law at least\nby general statements. The opinion stated: \"Such an abuse [conducting a search in an abusive fashion] cannot\nbe condoned. The searches must be conducted in a reasonable manner.\" I submit that any reasonable and\ncompetent officer would know that the conduct as alleged here was mentally and physically abusive and\nunreasonable. While the decision to search may be subject to the defense of qualified immunity, it was part of a\ncontinuum of circumstances that further demonstrates the egregiously abusive and unreasonable manner of the\nsearch itself. The conduct, as alleged, was manifestly overreaching.\nThe following quotes from Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) are pertinent:\nIn assessing whether the Eighth Amendment violation here met the Harlow test, the Court of\nAppeals required that the facts of previous cases be \"`materially similar' to Hope's situation.\" 240\nF.3d at 981. This rigid gloss on the qualified immunity standard, though supported by Circuit\nprecedent, is not consistent with our cases.\nId. at 739, 122 S.Ct. 2508 (footnote omitted).\n... For a constitutional right to be clearly established, its contours \"must be sufficiently clear that a\n498 reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. This is not to *498\nsay that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has\npreviously been held unlawful, see Mitchell [v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511,] 535, n. 12, 105 S.Ct. 2806,\n86 L.Ed.2d 411; but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be\napparent.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).\nId.\n....\nThe obvious cruelty inherent in this practice should have provided respondents with some notice\nthat their alleged conduct violated Hope's constitutional protection against cruel and unusual\npunishment. Hope was treated in a way antithetical to human dignity00he was hitched to a post for\n97\nan extended period of time in a position that was painful, and under circumstances that were both\ndegrading and dangerous. This wanton treatment was not done of necessity, but as punishment\nfor prior conduct. Even if there might once have been a question regarding the constitutionality of\nthis practice, the Eleventh Circuit precedent of Gates and Ort, as well as the DOJ report\ncondemning the practice, put a reasonable officer on notice that the use of the hitching post under\nthe circumstances alleged by Hope was unlawful. The \"fair and clear warning,\" Lanier, 520 U.S. at\n271, 117 S.Ct. 1219 that these cases provided was sufficient to preclude the defense of qualified\nimmunity at the summary judgment stage.\nId. at 745-46, 122 S.Ct. 2508.\nWhile Hope purports to rely, at least in part, on prior controlling Fifth Circuit cases, it also emphasizes the\negregious nature of the alleged conduct.\nRegardless of Hope, in Willingham v. Loughnan, 321 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir. 2003) this court stated:\nDecisions of this court before the Supreme Court's Hope decision demonstrate that the law of the\nCircuit harmoniously complies with the Supreme Court's reminder. We have repeatedly\nacknowledged the possibility that a general statement of the law might provide adequate notice of\nunlawfulness in the right circumstances. For example, before the Supreme Court's decision in \nHope, this court en banc specifically stated that \"general statements of law\" were capable of\ngiving fair warning of unconstitutional official behavior:\n\nWe acknowledge that preexisting case law, tied to the precise facts, is not in every situation\nessential to establish clearly the law applying to the circumstances facing a public official so that a\nreasonable official would be put on fair and clear notice that specific conduct would be unlawful in\nthe faced, specific circumstances. Some general statements of law are capable of giving fair and\nclear warning in some circumstances: the occasional \"obvious clarity\" cases per Lanier.\nMarsh v. Butler County, Alabama, 268 F.3d 1014, 1031 n. 9 (11th Cir.2001) (internal citations\nomitted); see also, e.g., Jenkins v. Talladega City Bd. of Educ., 115 F.3d 821, 825 n. 3 (11th\nCir.1997) (en banc) (stating \"general principles of [decisional] law can provide fair warning\" if\nconstitutional rule applies with \"obvious clarity\" to circumstances facing defendant); Lee v. Ferraro,\n284 F.3d 1188, 1199 (11th Cir.2002) (recognizing exception to requirement for factually similar\ncases where conduct so clearly unlawful that preexisting caselaw unnecessary); Rodriguez v.\nFarrell, 280 F.3d 1341, 1350 n. 18 (11th Cir.2002) (\"We very occasionally encounter the\nexceptional case in which a defendant officer's acts are so egregious that preexisting, fact-specific\n499 *499 precedent was not necessary to give clear warning to every reasonable (by which we, in the\nqualified immunity context, always mean every objectively reasonable) officer that what the\ndefendant officer was doing must be `unreasonable' within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment.\"); Skrtich v. Thornton, 280 F.3d 1295, 1304 n. 9 (11th Cir.2002) (\"[S]ome conduct is\nso obviously contrary to constitutional norms that even in the absence of caselaw, the defense of\nqualified immunity does not apply.\"); Brent v. Ashley, 247 F.3d 1294, 1303 n. 10 (11th Cir.2001)\n(noting general statements of law capable of giving fair warning to officials); Priester v. City of\nRiviera Beach, Florida, 208 F.3d 919, 926 (11th Cir.2000) (stating conduct which lies at core of\nFourth Amendment prohibition makes unlawfulness readily apparent without preexisting caselaw;\ndefense of qualified immunity not allowed); Smith v. Mattox, 127 F.3d 1416, 1419 (11th Cir.1997)\n(same). It is not news to us that official conduct may be so egregious that further warning and\nnotice beyond the general statement of law found in the Constitution or the statute or the caselaw\nis unnecessary; when we first decided this case, we did not believe that precedents with materially\nsimilar facts are always needed to overcome the defense of qualified immunity.\nI submit, considering the totality of the circumstances and the general statements of law in Bell, that the alleged\nfacts depict conduct so egregious as to foreclose the allowance of qualified immunity for the claims addressed in\nPart III. B.\n[*] Honorable Robert B. Propst, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] Because this is a review of a the denial of a motion for summary judgment by the appellant, we will recount\nthe facts favorably to the appellees. Rodriguez v. Farrell, 280 F.3d 1341, 1343 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002). The facts\nrecounted here are drawn primarily from the district court's order and the deposition testimony of the appellees.\n[2] The subsequent traffic stop was captured by a video recorder in Stephens's patrol car.\n[3] It would later turn out that the warrant was for a different man.\n[4] Jordan's testimony indicates that Evans was pushed into the room after Stephens ordered Jordan to lower his\npants. Evans's testimony indicates that he was pushed into the room before Stephens issued this order. This\ndiscrepancy in the appellees' deposition testimony does not affect our analysis of this appeal.\n[5] The object was possibly a baton or a flashlight. Evans and Jordan could not identify it.\n[6] Jordan testified that Stephens \"came back with a cold black object. I remember him placing it on me, he\njugged me one time on my left cheek, then he stuck me in my anus, then he jumped and laughed and giggled. He\nlooked at the other officer, they laughed and giggled at me when I jumped from the cold black object.\" Jordan\nDepo. Tr. at 16. \n\nEvans testified that \"I remember him taking a stick, he was talking to me, telling me to keep my hands on the\nwall. He took that whatever it was, he went in Detree's ass, open it up, he told Detree to take his hands and\nspread his butt cheeks.\" Evans Depo. Tr. at 15.\n[7] Jordan testified that \"I looked to my right and I seen the same thing happen to Mr. Evans.\" Jordan Depo. Tr. at\n16-17. Evans testified that \"he came on me, told me to spread my cheeks. He stick [sic] the stick in my ass. I let\ngo like this, I jumped up, he got real mad ... At this point in time, he told me, us, to turn around and put our arms\nout like this ... He took the object, he picked Detree's testicles up with the stick, lifting his testicles up with that\nthing ... Then he put the stick over there on me. He got back in Detree's, he moved my testicles with the stick,\nlooked, did like this. They was giggling and laughing, not so tough, is he, not so tough.\" Evans Depo. Tr. at 16-17.\n[8] Jordan testified in his deposition that Stephens was \"saying comments like I am going to send you boys to\nprison, y'all are going to get butt fucked up the ass. I am going to send y'all up the road for a long time, boy.\"\nJordan Depo. Tr. at 17. Evans testified that Stephens was \"saying you better get used to this, this is how it is in\nthe big house, this is where you getting ready to go. Somebody is going to be butt fucking you for the next 20\nyears, all because you got a smart mouth.\" Evans Depo. Tr. at 16-17.\n[9] Stephens offers a tamer version of the events at the jail. In his account, the searches occurred separately\nrather than simultaneously, took place in a cell across from the booking area, and consisted of Evans and Jordan\ncompliantly removing their outer clothing and pulling down their underwear for a visual inspection of their front\nand back. Stephens testified that no contact occurred, no body cavity inspections took place, and that he did not\nsay anything about prison rape.\n[10] The plaintiffs-appellees have not cross-appealed the district court's judgment in favor of Stephens on the\narrest claim; and their cross-appeals of the judgments in favor of the city and the police chief were dismissed by\norder of this Court on February 6, 2003, for lack of finality (i.e., lack of appellate jurisdiction). See Hudson v. Hall,\n231 F.3d 1289, 1293-94 (11th Cir.2000). Therefore, the only issues before us relate to Stephens's interlocutory\nappeal of the district court judgment holding that the searches were unconstitutional and that Stephens was not\nentitled to qualified immunity. \nAs a result of this opinion, judgment will be entered for Stephens, which apparently will render final the judgments\nin favor of the city and the police chief. If plaintiffs desire to appeal those judgments, they should file a new and\ntimely notice of appeal.\n[11] Stephens also argues that the beer can found in the car and pop top found in Jordan's pocket support his\nsuspicion of drug activity. As noted, the appellees contest whether Stephens actually found these items, and we\naccept their version of the facts for purposes of this appeal.\n[12] We note that although Stephens has argued that drug couriers sometimes use rental cars, he has not argued\nthat the appellees fit any drug courier profile, that they were traveling on a drug trafficking route, or that the\ncharacteristics of the appellees matched, in his law enforcement experience, characteristics typical of a drug\noffender. We also note that, although Stephens claims that he found the appellees' explanation about being lost\n\"suspicious,\" he is unable to articulate why that explanation is suspicious.\n[13] The fact that Stephens may have thought that he had reasonable suspicion does not affect the qualified\nimmunity analysis, which is an objective inquiry. Lassiter v. Ala. A&M Univ. Bd. of Trustees, 28 F.3d 1146, 1150\n(11th Cir.1994).\n[14] Some courts analyze strip searches or body cavity searches of incarcerated inmates under the Eighth\nAmendment rather than the Fourth. The cases cited apply the Bell analysis, whether that analysis is doctrinally\ngrounded in the Fourth or Eighth Amendment. See, e.g., Del Raine v. Williford, 32 F.3d 1024, 1039-42 (7th\nCir.1994) (applying the Bell framework in the Eighth Amendment context).\n[15] Only decisions of the Supreme Court, the Eleventh Circuit, and the highest court of the relevant state clearly\nestablish the law for purposes of qualified immunity. Marsh, 268 F.3d at 1032 n. 10.\n\n[16] Even if we were to accept the appellees' analogy to the excessive force cases, we think the closest of those\ncases is Post v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 7 F.3d 1552 (11th Cir.1993). There we held that a reasonable officer\ncould have interpreted the plaintiff's action of raising his hands to be cuffed as a hostile act to which spinning the\nplaintiff around, pushing him against a display case, and applying a choke hold before cuffing him was an\nappropriate response. 7 F.3d at 1559. The allegations of force by the appellees in this case demonstrate that\nforce was applied after Jordan took his hands off the wall and turned around to face Stephens and the other\nofficer; by analogy to Post, a reasonable officer could have interpreted these actions as active resistance to the\nsearch, to which pushing the appellees back against the wall and applying a choke hold was an arguably\njustifiable response.\n[17] While we have discussed the several objectionable aspects of these searches separately, we wish to make\nclear that we have also considered them cumulatively.\n[18] We note that appellees have not argued that Stephen's actions were \"sadistically and maliciously applied for\nthe very purpose of causing harm\" to appellees. Johnson v. Breeden, 280 F.3d 1308, 1321 (11th Cir.2002).\nAccordingly, we have no occasion to address issues raised by such an argument.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Ms. Hicks has an interest in this case because she was strip searched and\nplaced in a general jail population much like the Plaintiffs - Appellees in the\npresent case. Her case is Hicks v. Moore, et al., 11thCircuit Docket No. 03-13686-\nII, which is presently on interlocutory appeal to this Court from the district court's\ndenial of qualified and official immunity.\nMs. Hicks has an interest in this case because this Court has advised that it\nintends to hold its decision in her case until after en banc disposition of the present\nappeal. Ms. Hicks was invited by the Court to petition for permission to file this\nBrief, which she does pursuant to her Motion to File Amicus Curiae Brief, filed\nsimultaneously herewith.\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\nI. Whether arrestees who are to be placed in the general jail population can\nconstitutionally be subjected to a strip search only if the search is\nsupported by reasonable suspicion of the possession of weapons or\ncontraband.\nII.\nWhether the District Court properly denied qualified immunity to officer\nStephens.\nAMICUS CURIAE WILL ONLY ADDRESS THE FIRST ISSUE.\n\nI\nI\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nI\nDispensing with the requirement for an individualized and articulable\nI reasonable suspicion that a pretrial detainee is concealing drugs or contraband\nbefore subjecting the detainee to a strip search violates the U.S. Supreme Court's\ni\nholding in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). The Bell holding requires courts\nI\nto consider and weigh \"the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it\nI\nwas conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it was\nI conducted.\" Id__a_t. 559.\nThe .Bell balancing test is required because, as this Court has acknowledged,\nI\n\"strip searches represent a serious intrusion upon personal rights.\" Justice v. City\nI\nof Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (I 1thCir. 1992) (Strip searches are\nI\n\"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant,\nI embarrassing, repulsive, [and] signifying degradation and submission\").\nBecause of the invasiveness of strip searches, the Eleventh Circuit has ruled\nI\non four separate occasions that pretrial detainees may not be strip searched absent\nan articulable and reasonable suspicion that the detainee is concealing weapons or\ncontraband. See Justice, 961 F.2d at 192; Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678, 682\n(11 thCir. 2000), Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11 th Cir. 2001) and Cuesta\nv. School Bd. of Miami-Dade County, Fla., 285 F.3d 962, 969 (i I thCir. 2002).\n\nEven if this Court could ignore the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Bell,\nthere is no good reason to depart from twelve years of well-reasoned Eleventh\nCircuit holdings that require strip searchesto be supported by reasonable suspicion.\nIncidentally, all nine of the remaining federal circuit courts to address this issue\nhave also ruled that reasonable suspicion is required. See, e.g., Swain v. Spinney,\n117 F.3d 1 (1 stCir. 1997); Cottrell v. Kaysville City, Utah, 994 F.2d 730 (10 thCir.\n1993); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6thCir. 1989); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d\n796 (2d Cir. 1986); Stewart v. Lubbock County, Tex., 767 F.2d 153 (5tnCir. 1985),\ncert. denied, 475 U.S. 1066 (1986); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9thCir.\n1984); Maw Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7thCir. 1983); Hunter v.\nAuzer, 672 F.2d 668 (8thCir. 1982); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4thCir.\n1981).\nARGUMENT AND CITATIONS TO AUTHORITY\nARRESTEES WHO ARE TO BE PLACED IN GENERAL JAIL\nII\nPOPULATIONS CAN ONLY BE SUBJECTED TO A STRIP SEARCH IF\nTHE SEARCH IS SUPPORTED BY REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT\nTHE ARRESTEE POSSESSES WEAPONS OR CONTRABAND.\nThis Court has long held that police officers must have \"reasonable\nsuspicion\" that a pre-trial arrestee possesses weapons or contraband before they\nmay be strip searched. Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11 th Cir.\n1992) (\"Consequently, we hold that law enforcement officers may conduct a strip\n\nI\nI\nsearch of a juvenile in custody, even for a minor offense, based upon reasonable\ni\nsuspicion to believe that the juvenile is concealing weapons or contraband\"). This\nI Court has restated that rule on several occasions since 1992. See, e.g., Skurstenis v.\nJones, 236 F.3d 678, 682 (11 thCir. 2000) (\"This [blanket strip search policy], which\nI\ndoes not require any reasonable suspicion, does not comport with the requirements\nI\nof the Fourth Amendment\"); Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11 thCir. 2001)\nI\n(\"Because Wilson was strip searched absent reasonable suspicion, we hold that the\nI search of Wilson, as well as the jail's policy authorizing her search, violated the\nFourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures\"); and\nI\nCuesta v. School Bd. of Miami-Dade County, Fla., 285 F.3d 962, 969 (11 thCir.\nI\n2002) (\"Both cases [Skurstenis and Wilson] make clear that the Fourth Amendment\nI\nrequires jail officials to have 'reasonable suspicion' that an arrestee is concealing\nweapons or contraband before they can perform a strip search\").\nAll nine of the other federal circuits to reach this issue subscribe to this\nCircuit's \"reasonable suspicion\" requirement for pretrial detainee strip searches.\nSee Swain v. Spinner, 117 F.3d l (1 st Cir. 1997); Cottrell v. Kaysville Cit-y, Utah,\n994 F.2d 730 (10 taCir. 1993); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6thCir. 1989);\nWeber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986); Stewart v. Lubbock County, Tex., 767\nF.2d 153 (5thCir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1066 (1986); Giles v. Ackerman,\n746 F.2d 614 (9thCir. 1984); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th\n4\n\nCir. 1983); Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668 (8thCir. 1982); Logan v. Shealy, 660\nF.2d 1007 (4thCir. 1981).\nEach of those decisions has its foundation in the U.S. Supreme Court case of\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). The issue presented in Bell was whether\npretrial detainees, i.e., those charged with a crime but not yet tried on the charge,\nmay be subjected to strip searches and visual cavity searches following contact\nvisits with outsiders, ld__a_t_,558. In addressing that issue, the Court recognized that\na \"detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers,\" see id.\nat 559, but also that strip searches are invasions of personal privacy. Id__a_t_.558-559.\nThe Court held that searches of pretrial detainees must be reasonable, and\nreasonableness is to be determined on a case by case basis by balancing \"the need\nfor the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search\nentails.\" Id. at 559.\nThe Bell holding is consistent with Supreme Court cases dealing with\nsearches and seizures generally. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 18 n.15 (1968)\n(The more intrusive the search, the closer governmental authorities must come to\ndemonstrating probable cause for believing that the search will uncover the objects\nfor which the search is being conducted). As this Court has acknowledged, strip\nsearches are \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying,\n\nI\nI\nunpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, [and] signifying degradation and submission.\"\nI\nJustic____9_6_1_e,F.2d at 192 (citing Mary_ Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272).\nI Appellant in this case is asking this Court to ignore the mandate in Bell v.\nWolfish by giving jailers carte blanche to strip search all pretrial detainees who\nI\nmight be introduced into the general jail population. See Appellant's En Banc\nI\nBrief, p. 12 (\"In light of the issue posed by the Court, however, Appellant Stephens\nI\nsuggests that the Constitution does not require articulable reasonable suspicion to\nI conduct a strip search of a pretrial detainee who may come in contact with the\ngeneral jail population\").\nI\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court had wanted that result, it would have said so\nI\nexplicitly having already recognized the inherent security risks in any detention\ncenter. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 559 (detention facilities are \"fraught with serious\nsecurity dangers\"). Instead, the Court admonished that \"the test of reasonableness\nunder the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical\napplication.\" Id.__a_t.559. Thus, the Court created a balancing test which weighs the\ndetention center's security interests and the detainee's privacy interests, with due\nconsideration to \"the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it was\nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it was\nconducted.\" BeJ, 441 U.S. at 559 (emphasis added).\n6\n\nI\nI\nIn applying the justification for the strip search element of the _Bell balancing\nI\ntest, this Court inquires into the factual circumstances of the arrest and the nature of\nI the criminal charges. See, e.g., Justice, 961 F.2d at 194 (Officers had reasonable\narticulable suspicion based upon their suspicion of drinking and drug activity in\nI\narea where arrest made and that plaintiff consorted with other suspected drug users,\nI\nand the officers' observation that plaintiff was nervous and that she had been\nI\nhanded something prior to the arrest); Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 682 (Reasonable\nI suspicion for strip search of DUI suspect based upon officer's discovery of a .38\nspecial handgun in her possession); and W.ilson, 251 F.3d at 1343-1344 (Court\nI\nfound no reasonable suspicion based upon Sheriffs admission that \"I don't believe\nI\nwe had a reason to suspect that Wilson had any contraband\" and his officer's\nI\ndemonstrated lack of fear that plaintiff would flush any concealed substance down\nthe toilet\").\nGiven the Bell balancing test and explicit disavowal of a \"precise definition\nor mechanical application\" of a reasonable - and therefore constitutional - strip\nsearch, see id. at 559, this Court cannot create a bright line rule that always permits\nstrip searches of pretrial detainees who may be introduced into the general jail\npopulation. Indeed, every federal circuit court that has passed upon the issue has\nruled that the justification of \"institutional security,\" without more, is not enough to\nsupport a blanket strip search policy of pretrial detainees. See, e.g., Thompson v.\n\\.\n7\n\nCity of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d at 1447 (9thCir. 1989) (\"Although Thompson...\nwas placed into contact with the general jail population, such a factor by itself\ncannot justify a strip search.\"); Masters, 872 F.2d at 1254 (6th Cir. 1989) (\"[T]he\nfact of intermingling alone has never been found to justify such a search without\nconsideration of the nature of ttle offense and the question of whether there is any\nreasonable basis for concern that the particular detainee will attempt to introduce\nweapons or other contraband into the institution\"); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273\n(7thCir. 1983) (\"[E]nsuring the security needs of the City by strip searching\nplaintiffs-appellees was unreasonable without a reasonable suspicion by the\nauthorities that either of the twin dangers of concealing weapons or contraband\nexisted\").\nStrip searches of pretrial detainees, conducted without an articulable,\nindividualized suspicion that they are concealing contraband, violate the Fourth\nAmendment. Absent a showing of reasonable suspicion, the privacy interests of the\ninnocent-until-proven-guilty detainee must prevail under the U.S. Supreme Court's\nholding in Bell v. Wolfish, su__u_p__.\nCONCLUSION\nThis Court is bound by U.S. Supreme Court authority which does not permit\na blanket strip search policy for all pretrial detainees who may be introduced into\nthe general jail population. Instead, this Court should uphold twelve years worth of\n\nI\nI\nprior Eleventh Circuit decisions which require that such strip searches be supported\nI\nby an articulable and reasonable suspicion that the detainee possesses weapons or\ncontraband.\nI\nRespectfully submitted,\nI\nDELIUS LAW FIRM, P.C.\nI\nI\nScott D.

Rec. S1414-04 (daily ed. Feb. 12, 2004) (statement of Sen. Frist) (\"I wish everyone a safe President's\nDay recess\"); 150 Cong. Rec. S1415-02 (daily ed. Feb. 12, 2004) (statement of Sen. Frist) (\"the Senate, at 8:49\np.m., adjourned until Monday, February 23, 2004\"). During that break, on 20 February 2004, the President\nappointed William H. Pryor Jr. to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The President relied on the Recess\n1222 Appointments Clause. *1222 U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 3. In this case, plaintiff-appellees by a timely written\n[1]\nmotion challenge the authority of Judge Pryor to act as a United States Circuit Judge.  We conclude that the\nPresident's appointment was not beyond his constitutional power.\nThe Judicial Branch is the controlling interpreter of how the Constitution applies. But the President, in his capacity\nas chief executive of this country, is also sworn to uphold the Constitution. And when the President is acting\nunder the color of express authority of the United States Constitution, we start with a presumption that his acts\n[2]\nare constitutional. See United States v. Allocco, 305 F.2d 704, 713 (2d Cir.1962) (Recess Appointments Clause\n\ncase); see also U.S. v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3105, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974) (observing \"In the\nperformance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Government must initially interpret the\nConstitution, and the interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great respect from the others.\"). To be\nsure, the presumption is a rebuttable one; but the burden is on the challengers to overcome it with their\narguments and to persuade us to the contrary. Just to show that plausible interpretations of the pertinent\nconstitutional clause exist other than that advanced by the President is not enough. We are not persuaded that\nthe President acted beyond his authority in this case: both the words of the Constitution and the history of the\nnation support the President's authority.\nRecess Appointments to Article III Courts are Allowed\nWe focus mainly on what the Constitution says and does not say. The text of the United States Constitution\n1223 authorizes recess appointments of judges to Article III courts.[3] Article II, Section 2, *1223 Clause 3 of the United\nStates Constitution specifically says \"The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen\nduring the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\"\nThe term \"Vacancies\" refers to the offices listed in the preceding clause: \"Ambassadors, other public Ministers\nand Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are\nnot herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law.\" In other words, Clause 2 explains the\nappointments the President may make with Senate advice and consent; Clause 3 explains the President may\nmake temporary appointments to \"all\" of these offices without Senate advice and consent. Recess appointments\nto the judiciary are allowed: one of the offices specifically mentioned is \"Judges of the supreme Court.\"\nAppointments of United States Circuit Judges are covered. See The Federalist No. 78, at 522 (Alexander\nHamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961) (noting that judges are to be appointed in the same manner as executive\nofficers: \"the officers of the union in general ...\"); The Federalist No. 67, at 455 (Alexander Hamilton) (Jacob E.\nCooke ed., 1961) (noting that the term \"Vacancies\" must \"be construed to relate to the `officers' described in the\npreceding [clause]\").\nHistory unites with our reading to support our conclusion. As we understand it, beginning with President\nWashington, over 300 recess appointments to the federal judiciary (including fifteen to the Supreme Court) have\nbeen made. Historical evidence of this practice alone might not make the recess appointment constitutional, but\nthis historical practice00looked at in the light of the text of the Constitution00 supports our conclusion in favor of the\n97 97\nconstitutionality of recess appointments to the federal judiciary. See generally Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783,\n103 S.Ct. 3330, 3335, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983) (observing that historical practice of Framers \"sheds light\" on the\nintended meaning of constitutional provisions).\nAlthough we see some tension between Article III and the recess appointment of judges to Article III courts, we\nreject the argument that the language in Article III, saying that judges serve during \"good Behaviour\" and without\na diminished salary, somehow trumps the Recess Appointments Clause. The conflict between these equally\nimportant constitutional provisions is not irreconcilable: the temporary judges appointed under the Recess\nAppointments Clause are an exception to the general rule of Article III. The text of the Recess Appointments\nClause refers specifically to \"all\" vacancies: we accept that the Clause does not leave out Article III judicial\n[4]\nvacancies.\nThe Constitution, on its face, neither distinguishes nor limits the powers that a recess appointee may exercise\nwhile in office. That is, during the limited term in which a recess appointee serves, the appointee is afforded the\n1224 full extent of authority commensurate with that office. For those who fear judicial recess appointments *1224\nbecause the appointments bypass the Senate completely, we stress the obvious: the temporary judges lose their\noffices at the end of the Senate's next Session.\n[5]\nWe accept that it was the intent of the Framers to keep important offices filled and government functioning.\nAnd while recess appointees may not have every bit of the protection for their independence that regularly\nconfirmed Article III judges have, we accept the Framers thought that what might be intolerable, if prolonged, was\n[6]\nacceptable for a relatively short while.  And, of course, plenty of the judges in this country (for example, state\njudges) then and now do not have all the protection of Article III judges; yet these courts are not seen to be\n\ninherently unfair, and the litigants who appear before them have not been held to have been denied due process\non that account. So, we can readily accept that the Framers would tolerate, on a temporary basis, some federal\njudges who lacked Article III protection.\nThe Second and Ninth Circuits, in reasoned opinions, have also decided that the Recess Appointments Clause\nreaches appointments to Article III courts. United States v. Woodley, 751 F.2d 1008 (9th Cir.1985) (en banc); \nUnited States v. Allocco, 305 F.2d 704 (2d Cir.1962).\n\"The Recess of the Senate\" Includes an Intrasession Recess\nFocusing first on the language of the Constitution, and then on the nation's history and on the purpose of the\nRecess Appointments Clause, we also conclude that President Bush appointed Judge Pryor during a legitimate\nSenate recess, that is, during a \"Recess\" within the meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause. In this case,\nthe Senate's break fits the definition of \"recess\" in use when the Constitution was ratified: the dictionary\ndefinitions that have been called to our attention (or that we have found) did not, for example, speak of a\nminimum time. See, e.g., A Dictionary of the English Language (1755) (reprinted 1967) (defining \"recess\" as\n\"retirement; retreat; withdrawing; secession\" or \"remission and suspension of any procedure\"). And the text of the\nConstitution does not differentiate expressly between inter- and intrasession recesses for the Recess\nAppointments Clause.\nThe challengers have used both history and textual analysis to support their contentions that the ten- or eleven-\nday break in the Senate's Session that underlies Judge Pryor's appointment was not a \"Recess\" within the\nmeaning of the Recess Appointments Clause. We have considered all of the arguments. But the arguments are\nnot so strong as to persuade us that the President's interpretation is incorrect. For example, we reject the\nargument that the plain meaning of the phrase, \"the Recess of the Senate,\" limits the opportunity to make recess\nappointments to one particular recess: the recess at the end of a Session. We do not agree that the Framers' use\nof the term \"the\" unambiguously points to the single recess that comes at the end of a Session. Instead, we\n1225 accept that \"the Recess,\" originally and through today, could just as properly refer *1225 generically to any\none00intrasession or intersession 00of the Senate's acts of recessing, that is, taking a break. See The Random\n97 97\nHouse Dictionary of the English Language 1965 (2d ed.1987) (1966) (defining \"the\" as \"used to mark a noun as\nbeing used generically: the dog is a quadruped\"); 17 The Oxford English Dictionary, 879 (2d ed.1989) (1928)\n(defining \"the\" as \"referring to a term used generically or universally\" and providing examples of such usage from\n[7]\nthe 18th Century).\nFor another example, we are not persuaded by the argument that the Framers' use, in three other clauses, of the\nterm \"Adjournment,\" and not \"Recess,\" necessarily limits the meaning of \"Recess\" to a particular kind of break:\nonly a break at the end of a Session. Instead of describing a block of time, the term \"Adjournment\" in the\nConstitution can be read to signify a parliamentary action: Congress's taking or having taken a break. See e.g.,\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2 (\"If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days ... the Same shall be\na Law ... unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return ...\").\nWe know that the Supreme Court has used the term \"Adjournment\" in a manner that suggests that the word\nsignifies a break period rather than signifying a means by which a break is taken. See Wright v. United States,\n302 U.S. 583, 58 S.Ct. 395, 398, 82 L.Ed. 439 (1938). The Supreme Court there was construing the term\n\"Adjournment\" for purposes of the Pocket Veto Clause: the question of the meaning of the word \"Recess\" in the\nRecess Appointments Clause was not before the Court. We note, however, that even if the Wright Court's usage\nof \"Adjournment\" and \"Recess\" were directly applicable here, their usage would suggest that the term\n\"Adjournment\" is the formal break occurring at the end of a Session and that a \"Recess\" is something that can\nand does occur during a Session. See id. at 398 (noting that a three-day \"recess is not an adjournment\"). This\nusage by the Supreme Court tends to support our accepting the President's interpretation that a \"Recess\"\nincludes a break during a Session.\nThe Constitution, on its face, does not establish a minimum time that an authorized break in the Senate must last\nto give legal force to the President's appointment power under the Recess Appointments Clause. And we do not\n\nset the limit today. Although a President has not before appointed a judge to an Article III court during an\nintrasession recess as short as the one in this case, appointments to other offices00offices ordinarily requiring\n97\n[8]\nSenate confirmation00have been made during intrasession recesses of about this length or shorter.\n97\nFurthermore, several times in the past, fairly short intrasession recesses have given rise to presidential\n[9]\nappointments of judges to Article III courts.\n1226 *1226 Twelve Presidents have made more than 285 intrasession recess appointments of persons to offices that\nordinarily require consent of the Senate. So, given the words of the Constitution and the history, we are\nunpersuaded by the argument that the recess appointment power may only be used in an intersession recess,\nbut not an intrasession recess. Furthermore, what we understand to be the main purpose of the Recess\nAppointments Clause00to enable the President to fill vacancies to assure the proper functioning of our\n97\ngovernment 00supports reading both intrasession recesses and intersession recesses as within the correct scope\n97\n[10]\nof the Clause. That an intersession recess might be shorter than an intrasession recess is entirely possible.\nThe purpose of the Clause is no less satisfied during an intrasession recess than during a recess of potentially\neven shorter duration that comes as an intersession break.\n\"Vacancies\" Need Not Arise During the Recess in Order to be Filled\nAbout the phrase in the Recess Appointments Clause that speaks of filling \"Vacancies that may happen during\nthe Recess,\" we accept this phrase, in context, means that, if vacancies \"happen\" to exist during a recess, they\nmay be filled on a temporary basis by the President. This view is consistent with the understanding of most\njudges that have considered the question, written executive interpretations from as early as 1823, and legislative\nacquiescence. See United States v. Woodley, 751 F.2d 1008, 1012 (9th Cir.1985) (en banc) (noting that contrary\ninterpretation \"conflicts with a common sense reading of the word happen, as well as the construction given to\nthis word by the three branches of our government\"); United States v. Allocco, 305 F.2d 704, 709-15 (2d Cir.1962)\n; see also In re Farrow, 3 F. 112 (N.D.Ga.1880).\nOn its face, the phrase is open to more than one interpretation. For example, the word \"happen\" can be defined\nas \"befall\" which has been defined as \"happen to be.\" Compare 6 Oxford English Dictionary 1096 (2d ed.1989)\n(1928) with 2 Oxford English Dictionary at 62. Therefore, the phrase's most accepted interpretation (upon which\nthe President has relied and that we too accept) does not contradict the plain meaning rule.\nIn addition, as we understand the history, early Presidents00when delegates to the Constitutional Convention\n97\nwere still active in government00made recess appointments to fill vacancies that originated while the Senate was\n97\nin Session. For example, President Washington, during a Senate break in 1789, appointed Cyrus Griffin to fill a\njudgeship created during a previous Session; and President Jefferson, during a Senate break in 1801, appointed\nthree judges to fill vacancies created during a previous Session.\nCongress at least implicitly agrees with this view of recess appointments. See 5 U.S.C. § 5503 (1996) (discussing\n[11]\nsalary requirements for officers appointed to fill a vacancy that existed while Senate was in session).\n1227 Furthermore, interpreting the *1227 phrase to prohibit the President from filling a vacancy that comes into being\non the last day of a Session but to empower the President to fill a vacancy that arises immediately thereafter (on\nthe first day of a recess) contradicts what we understand to be the purpose of the Recess Appointments Clause:\n[12]\nto keep important offices filled and the government functioning.\nOne Non-Justiciable Issue Is Presented\nAs judges, we have the authority and duty to construe and to apply the Constitution as it is written. We have done\nso today to conclude that the Constitution gives to the President the discretionary authority to appoint a judge to\nfill a vacancy on an Article III court during a ten- or eleven-day, intrasession recess of the Senate.\nPlaintiff-appellees seem to go on to contend another thing. They contend that the President misused this\ndiscretionary appointment authority in this particular instance because Judge Pryor's nomination 00before the\n97\n\nrecess appointment00had been especially controversial and his confirmation had been blocked in the Senate. The\n97\nargument, as we understand it, is that this specific recess appointment circumvented and showed an improper\nlack of deference to the Senate's advice-and-consent role and, thus, should not be allowed.\nThis kind of argument presents a political question that moves beyond interpretation of the text of the Constitution\nand on to matters of discretionary power, comity and good policy. These matters are criteria of political wisdom\nand are highly subjective. They might be the proper cause for political challenges to the President, but not for\njudicial decision making: we lack the legal standards00once we move away from interpreting the text of the\n97\nConstitution00to determine how much Presidential deference is due to the Senate when the President is\n97\nexercising the discretionary authority that the Constitution gives fully to him.\nConclusion\nWe are not persuaded the President exceeded his constitutional authority in a way that causes Judge Pryor's\njudicial appointment to be invalid. We conclude that Judge Pryor may sit with this Court lawfully and act with all\n[13]\nthe powers of a United States Circuit Judge during his term of office.\n1228 *1228 MOTION DENIED.[14]\n[1]\nBARKETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting :\nThe Constitution states that\n[t]he President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the\nSenate.\nU.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 3. The application of this provision raises three questions. First, can the President use\nthe Recess Appointments Clause to fill a vacancy that did not occur during a recess? Second, when must the\nPresident exercise his power to fill a vacancy \"that may happen during the Recess\"? Third, does the phrase \"the\nRecess\" include both inter-session and intra-session recesses? To decide on the petitioners' motion, we need\nonly determine the answers to the first two of these questions.\nThe majority finds, first, that it matters not whether a vacancy happens during a recess, but only that it exist\nduring a recess. Second, the majority says that the President can fill any vacancy that exists during one recess\n[2]\nwith an appointment made during any subsequent recess.\n1229 *1229 Because I believe that the majority's conclusions conflict with the words of the Constitution, the purpose of\nthe Recess Appointments Clause, and the structural principles underlying the Constitution's delicate balance of\npower between the executive and legislative branches of government, I respectfully dissent.\nI. The Plain Meaning of the Constitution\nThe first rule of constitutional interpretation is to look to the plain meaning of the Constitution's text. Solorio v.\nUnited States, 483 U.S. 435, 447, 107 S.Ct. 2924, 97 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987). See also Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9\nWheat) 1, 188, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824) (\"As men, whose intentions require no concealment, generally employ the\nwords which most directly and aptly express the ideas they intend to convey, the enlightened patriots who framed\nour constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be understood to have employed words in their natural\nsense, and to have intended what they have said.\") (Marshall, C.J.).\nUnder this rule, the plain meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause directly, expressly, and unambiguously\nrequires that before a vacancy can be filled through the recess appointment power, that vacancy must have\noccurred during a Senate recess.\nThe majority argues that the recess power is valid to fill a vacancy already in existence at the time of the recess.\nAccording to the majority's reading, the Constitution does not say that a vacancy, to be filled, must be created\n\nduring that recess. See Majority Order at 1226 (\"`Vacancies' Need Not Arise During the Recess in Order to be\nFilled\"). But that is precisely what the Constitution does say. The Recess Appointments Clause applies only to\nthose \"Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\" U.S. Const., Art. 2, § 2, cl. 3 (emphasis\n1230 added).[3] This language needs no interpretation. The text does not say that the President shall *1230 have the\npower to fill all vacancies that may exist during the Recess of the Senate. Instead, it uses the term \"happen,\"\nwhose plain meaning, now as it was in the eighteenth century, is \"to take place; to occur, betide, befall.\" Oxford\n[4]\nEnglish Dictionary, 2nd ed. (1989).  A vacancy that \"may happen during the Recess of the Senate\" can only be\na vacancy that takes place or occurs \"during the Recess of the Senate.\" It clearly cannot be a vacancy that\nhappens while the Senate is in session.\n1231 The plain meaning of the term \"happen\" seems all the more ineluctable when one *1231 recalls that the 1787\nConstitution included not one but two clauses concerning recess appointments. The original Article I contained a\nprovision for the filling of Senate vacancies that read as follows:\n[I]f Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any\nState, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the\nLegislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.\nU.S. Const., art. I, § 3, cl. 2, superseded by U.S. Const. amend. XVII. It seems difficult to imagine that the\nframers could have intended the term \"happen\" here to mean anything other than \"occur\" or \"take place\" given\nthat the manner in which they envisioned a vacancy \"happening\" was \"by Resignation, or otherwise.\" That is to\nsay, the framers seem to have contemplated that a vacancy would \"happen\" when a particular triggering event\noccurred00 whether a resignation or other event (such as a sudden illness or death)00the timing of which event\n97 97\ncould be clearly said to fall \"during the Recess\" of the Senate. And since there is no reason why the Framers\nwould have intended the term \"happen\" to mean one thing in Article I and something different in Article II,\nparticularly where both articles relate to the same subject of recess appointments, the majority's reading of the\nArticle II Recess Appointments Clause seems even more difficult to reconcile with the plain meaning of the\nConstitution. See Whitman v. National Bank of Oxford, 176 U.S. 559, 563, 20 S.Ct. 477, 44 L.Ed. 587 (1900)\n(\"The simplest and most obvious interpretation of a Constitution, if in itself sensible, is the most likely to be that\nmeant by the people in its adoption.\") (internal citation and quotations omitted); National Mut. Ins. Co. of D.C. v.\nTidewater Transfer Co., 337 U.S. 582, 587-88, 69 S.Ct. 1173, 93 L.Ed. 1556 (1949) (holding that to classify the\nDistrict of Columbia as a \"state\" would give the word \"state\" as used in Article III a meaning inconsistent with its\nuse in the Constitution's other articles, and finding that \"such inconsistency in a single instrument is to be implied\nonly where the context clearly requires it\").\nThus, the question of when a vacancy must occur admits of very little ambiguity. Accordingly, the plain meaning\nrule compels the conclusion that the Constitution means what it says: the recess appointment power of Article II\n[5]\nis good only for those vacancies that happen while the Senate is in recess.\nII. The Purpose of the Recess Appointment Power\nDetermining whether the President can fill a vacancy that did not occur while the Senate was in recess still leaves\nopen the question of when the President can make a recess appointment itself. Contrary to what the majority\nholds, the Constitution certainly does not endorse the conclusion that the President can fill a vacancy that\nhappens during one recess by making an appointment during a subsequent recess. Where a constitutional\n1232 provision is unclear or silent on a particular issue, we must *1232 look to the spirit and purpose of the provision\nfor guidance. See Baker by Thomas v. General Motors Corp., 522 U.S. 222, 232, 118 S.Ct. 657, 139 L.Ed.2d 580\n(1998) (finding that the \"animating purpose\" of the Full Faith and Credit Clause was to \"alter the status of the\nseveral states as independent foreign sovereignties\" and \"make them integral parts of a single nation\") (internal\ncitation omitted); Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 350-51, 359, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (finding\nthat one of the purposes of the Fourth Amendment is to protect the public's reasonable expectations of privacy,\nand holding that the admission of evidence obtained by an electronic wiretap without a warrant is\nunconstitutional); Green v. U.S., 355 U.S. 184, 187, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957) (emphasizing that the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment was \"designed to protect an individual from being subjected to\nthe hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense\").\nAt the time of the founding, the purpose of the Recess Appointments Clause was to enable the President to fill\nvacancies that arose when the Senate is disabled from acting upon appointments. The Framers' only known\ndiscussion of the Recess Appointments Clause is The Federalist No. 67, by Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton wrote:\nThe relation in which [the recess appointments] clause stands to the [advice-and-consent clause],\nwhich declares the general mode of appointing officers of the United States, denotes it to be\nnothing more than a supplement to the other, for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary method\nof appointment, in cases to which the general method was inadequate. The ordinary power of\nappointment is confined to the President and Senate jointly, and can therefore only be exercised\nduring the session of the Senate; but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be\ncontinually in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might happen in their\nrecess, which it might be necessary for the public service to fill without delay, the succeeding\nclause is evidently intended to authorize the President, singly, to make temporary appointments\n\"during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their\nnext session.\"\n[6]\nThe Federalist No. 67, at 391 (Isaac Kramnick ed., 1987) (emphasis in the original).  Thus, Hamilton argues,\nthe Framers added the Recess Appointments Clause to the Constitution in order to ensure that the President\nwould be able to fill offices when the Senate was unable to act on the President's nominees. Nowhere does\nHamilton suggest that the clause was added to allow the President to appoint someone whom the Senate might\nrefuse to confirm.\nThe leading early nineteenth-century constitutional treatise, Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution,\nreinforces this description of the purpose of the Recess Appointments Clause. Story notes that the recess\nappointment power was designed to avoid requiring the Senate to be \"perpetually in session, in order to provide\nfor the appointment of officers.\" As such, Story wrote, the clause was meant simply to further the interests of\n[7]\n\"convenience, promptitude of action, and general security.\"\n1233 *1233 Without quite admitting the point in full, the majority correctly acknowledges that allowing the President to\nfill up vacancies in federal offices while the Senate is disabled from acting on presidential nominations is the\npurpose of the recess appointment power. See Order at 1224 (\"We accept that it was the intent of the Framers to\nkeep important offices filled and government functioning.\"); id. at 1226 (\"[T]he main purpose of the Recess\nAppointments Clause [is] to enable the President to fill vacancies to assure the proper functioning of our\ngovernment.\"). But the majority's reading of the scope of the recess appointment power is far broader than this\njustification allows. This is because the majority's holding gives a President the power to repeatedly circumvent\nthe Senate's advice-and-consent role even when the Senate is not disabled from exercising that role but is,\ninstead, perfectly capable of exercising it.\nUnder the majority's reading, if the Senate refuses to give its consent to a particular nominee during a particular\nsession, there is nothing to stop a President from waiting not just until the immediately ensuing recess, but also\nuntil after the Senate has repeatedly reconvened and recessed before appointing that person through the recess\nappointment power. There is absolutely no reason why the Senate would not be able to exercise its advice-and-\nconsent role over this long span of time, and yet the majority's interpretation gives a President the ability to\nappoint someone without regard to whether the Senate has in fact been available to consider that nominee. All\nthat a President need worry about, under such a view, is (1) whether the Senate is in town and (2) whether there\nis a vacancy in a federal office.\nThis example suffices to show that the majority's explanation of the justification of the Recess Appointments\nClause00to allow a President to fill vacancies when the Senate cannot act to confirm nominees00 bears little or no\n97 97\nrelation to its reading of the scope of a President's recess appointment power. For this reading makes no attempt\nto limit the use of the recess appointment power to those circumstances in which the Senate is in fact disabled\nfrom acting on presidential nominations, even though this is the only conceivable (and indeed the only historical)\n\njustification for the recess appointment power. As Hamilton emphasized in The Federalist No. 67, the recess\nappointment power is \"nothing more than a supplement\" or \"auxiliary\" to the \"ordinary\" and \"general mode of\nappointing officers of the United States,\" which is \"jointly,\" by way of the Senate's advice and consent. The\nFederalist No. 67, at 391 (Isaac Kramnick ed., 1987) (emphasis in the original). The majority's decision, however,\nentails that a President can fill a vacancy at any point in the future when the Senate is not in session. This cannot\nbe correct.\nIII. Structural Principles and the Separation of Powers\nWhere a provision of the Constitution is silent on a matter, we must also read that provision so that it will\nharmonize with other constitutional provisions. See Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 433, 99 S.Ct. 1182, 59 L.Ed.2d\n416 (1979) (\"[W]hen the Constitution is ambiguous or silent on a particular issue, this Court has often relied on\nnotions of a constitutional plan00the implicit ordering of relationships within the federal system necessary to make\n97\nthe Constitution a workable governing charter and to give each provision within that document the full effect\nintended by the Framers.\"). If the Constitution did not contain any other provisions concerning the appointment of\n1234 federal officers, it might be possible to conclude with the majority that a President could fill a vacancy created \n*1234 during one recess with an appointment made during a subsequent recess. It might even be possible to\nconclude that a President could fill a vacancy created during a recess at any future time, including when the\nSenate is in active session. But the Constitution does contain another provision concerning the appointment of\nfederal officers. The Constitution states that the President\nshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint\nAmbassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other\nOfficers of the United States.\nU.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2. Thus, the Constitution gives to the Senate the power to withhold its consent to any\nnomination to a federal office made by a President. By interpreting the Recess Appointments Clause to allow a\nPresident to fill a vacancy created during one recess with an appointment made during a subsequent recess, we\nare effectively allowing a President to side-step the Senate's advice-and-consent role even where the Senate is \nnot disabled from fulfilling that role00which, I note again at the risk of repetition, was and still is the only reason for\n97\ncreating a recess appointment power.\nI do not believe that the Constitution permits a President to frustrate in this way the careful separation of powers\nintended by the framers. In between a recess during which the vacancy was created and a recess during which it\nis filled, the Senate would be in active session and would be perfectly capable of carrying out its advice-and-\nconsent responsibilities. There would be no reason why the Senate would not in fact carry out those\nresponsibilities 00unless, of course, it chose not to give its consent to a particular candidate. Yet the Senate's\n97\nrefusal to consent to a presidential nomination does not justify the President in circumventing the text and\nstructure of the Constitution.\nConsidering that the Recess Appointments Clause was intended to enable the President to fill vacancies only\nwhen the Senate was disabled from acting, and in light of the role that Article II gives the Senate in approving\nnominations to federal offices, there must be some more meaningful limit on the President's power to make a\nrecess appointment than the two the majority proposes (i.e., that the Senate be in recess and that there be a\nvacancy to fill). The only plausible limit00as well as the most obvious one00is to require the President to fill a\n97 97\nvacancy during the same recess in the course of which it happens. This reading is supported not only by\nconsiderations of constitutional purpose and structure, but also by the language of the Recess Appointments\nClause, which suggests that the context in which the recess appointment power is triggered00the happening of a\n97\nvacancy during a particular recess00also defines the limits of the recess appointment power. See The Federalist\n97\nNo. 67, at 391 (Alexander Hamilton) (Isaac Kramnick ed., 1987) (\"The time within which the [recess appointment]\npower is to operate, `during the recess of the Senate,' and the duration of the appointments, `to the end of the\nnext session' of that body, conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision ...\").\n\nIV. Some Additional Considerations\nThe Second and Ninth Circuits have ruled that the President may use the recess appointment power to fill any\nvacancy that exists at the time of a particular recess, even if the vacancy did not happen or occur during that\nsame recess. See United States v. Allocco, 305 F.2d 704 (2nd Cir.1962); United States v. Woodley, 751 F.2d\n1008 (9th Cir.1985). In so finding, Woodley relied essentially upon the reasoning of Allocco, which conceded that\n1235 its *1235 interpretation of the recess appointment power did not reflect a literal and logical reading of the\nConstitution. The Allocco Court observed that, in matters of constitutional interpretation, \"the logic of words\nshould yield to the logic of realities.\" Allocco, 305 F.2d at 710 (quoting Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U.S. 34, 43,\n47 S.Ct. 267, 71 L.Ed. 524 (1927) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). By \"the logic of realities,\" the Allocco Court had in\nmind the need to avoid a situation in which \"judicial offices which are vacant on the day the Senate adjourns must\nremain vacant until the Senate reconvenes and has the opportunity to fill them.\" Id. Any other result, the Allocco\nCourt reasoned, would \"create Executive paralysis and do violence to the orderly functioning of our complex\ngovernment.\" Id. at 712.\nAs an initial matter, while it is a proper for an Article III court to consider the range of circumstances that its\ninterpretation of a particular constitutional provision might cover, such consideration cannot displace the\nobligation to decide concrete \"Cases\" and \"Controversies\" in accordance with the plain meaning and purpose of\nthe Constitution. See U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. Second, even on a purely practical note, the Allocco and \nWoodley argument about the dangers of governmental paralysis is more of a phantom than anything else, even\nin the context of our own times. The vacation of an office vital to the conduct of national security two days before\nthe Senate goes on recess is a useful example. Despite the initial appeal of the Allocco and Woodley argument in\nthis context, a few moments of reasoned deliberation will show that adhering to the plain meaning and purpose of\nthe Recess Appointments Clause does not threaten in any way the President's ability to successfully manage the\ngovernment during a security crisis. Common sense and practical experience tell us that the President can and\ndoes call upon whichever individuals00 acting officials, deputy directors, etc.00he needs to assist him in such a\n97 97\nsituation. A formal appointment is of little importance at such a time.\nIn contrast, there is a real, concrete concern that the understanding of the recess appointment power embraced\nby the majority will allow the President to repeatedly bypass the role the Framers intended the Senate to play in\nreviewing presidential nominees. Thus, for the reasons discussed above, the reasoning of Allocco and Woodley\nnot only fails to adhere to the text of the Constitution, as Allocco itself acknowledged, but also makes the wrong\ntradeoff between executive and legislative authority, a tradeoff that comports neither with the purpose of the\n[8]\nRecess Appointments Clause nor with the structure of the Constitution.\nOther than Allocco and Woodley, neither of which establishes the governing law of this circuit, the only authority\nthe majority is able to muster for its interpretation is 5 U.S.C. § 5503 (1994). The majority characterizes this\nstatute as a discussion of \"salary requirements for officers appointed to fill a vacancy that existed while Senate\nwas in session\" and suggests that it indicates Congress has implicitly agreed with the majority's interpretation.\nOrder at 1227. But 5 U.S.C. § 5503 is not a discussion of \"salary requirements\" at all. Rather, it provides that\n1236 [p]ayment for services may not be made from the Treasury of the United States *1236 to an\nindividual appointed during a recess of the Senate to fill a vacancy in an existing office, if the\nvacancy existed while the Senate was in session and was by law required to be filled by and with\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, until the appointee has been confirmed by the Senate.\n5 U.S.C. § 5503(a). Contrary to what the majority suggests, this statute does not indicate that Congress has\nimpliedly consented to the majority's interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause. Rather, the statute shows\njust the opposite: it shows that Congress itself has disapproved of the President's use of the recess appointment\npower to fill a vacancy that \"existed while the Senate was in session and was by law required to be filled by and\n[9]\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\" Id.\n\nThe statute goes on to set forth three very limited exceptions to the general prohibition on the payment of salaries\n[10]\nto officers appointed in violation of the Recess Appointments Clause.  But those exceptions do not establish\nthe constitutionality of the majority's interpretation: they suggest instead that Congress has simply decided to\nrecognize the reality of an existing (and unconstitutional) practice. The exceptions to the statute only underline\nthat Congress does not have the last word over the constitutionality of the President's use of the recess\nappointment power. See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803) (\"It is emphatically\nthe province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\"). Moreover, I do not see how these\n[11]\nexceptions, which were added to the statute in 1940,  can be used to tell us anything about the meaning of a\nconstitution framed and ratified in the late 1780s. If anything, 5 U.S.C. § 5503 undermines rather than supports\nthe majority's decision.\nThe statute also calls into question the Woodley Court's finding, echoed by the majority here, that \"there is an\nunbroken acceptance of the President's use of the recess power ... by the three branches of government.\" \nWoodley, 751 F.2d at 1011. Nor is 5 U.S.C. § 5503 the only evidence of congressional disagreement with the\nPresident's understanding of the scope of the recess appointment power. See, e.g., William Rawle, A View of the\nConstitution of the United States 162-67 (2nd ed. 1829) at 162-67 (quoted in Ralph Lerner and Philip Kurland,\n1237 eds., The Founders' Constitution (1987), vol. 4 at 115) (\"It would be improper to pass over the construction *1237\ngiven by the senate to the power of appointing during their recess. It has been held by that venerable body, that if\nnew offices are created by congress, the president cannot, after the adjournment of the senate, make\nappointments to fill them. The vacancies do not happen during the recess of the senate.\") (emphasis in the\noriginal).\nMore to the point, however, even if one accepts at face value the Woodley Court's assertion of an \"unbroken\"\nhistory of acceptance, the failure of one branch of government to challenge how another branch understands or\napplies the Constitution does not render the latter's view correct. This is particularly so where the Constitution's\nplain meaning, purpose, and structure all militate against accepting that view. Nor does the failure of litigants to\nbring constitutional challenges to the executive's use of the Recess Appointment Clause tell us anything about\nwhat the clause means. Adverse possession is a rule of property law, not constitutional law. There is no statute of\nlimitations for interpreting and enforcing the Constitution. See Freytag v. C.I.R., 501 U.S. 868, 880, 111 S.Ct.\n2631, 2639, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991) (finding that \"[n]either Congress nor the Executive can agree to waive [the]\nstructural protection\" of the Appointments Clause, and that the \"structural interests protected by the Appointments\nClause are not those of any one branch of Government but of the entire Republic\"); I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S.\n919, 942 at n. 13, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983) (rejecting the argument that a law dating back to 1940\nis immune to the constitutional scrutiny of courts simply because it was passed by Congress and approved by the\nPresident). The President's use of the recess appointment power has been challenged on appeal only twice\nbefore, in Allocco and Woodley, both of which decisions privileged a supposed history of congressional and\njudicial acquiescence over the Constitution's plain meaning, purpose, and structure. The question of which\nshould prevail 00a debatable historical view or the clear import of the Constitution00has never before reached the\n97 97\nSupreme Court.\nA final observation: by invoking the political question doctrine at the end of its order, the majority conflates the\nPlaintiff-Appellees' description of the circumstances of Judge Pryor's appointment with the reasons for its\nunconstitutionality. See Majority Order at 1226-27 (\"Plaintiff-Appellees... contend that the President misused [his]\ndiscretionary appointment authority in this particular instance because Judge Pryor's nomination00before the\n97\nrecess appointment00had been especially controversial and his confirmation had been blocked in the Senate. The\n97\nargument, as we understand it, is that this specific recess appointment circumvented, and showed an improper\nlack of deference to the Senate's advice-and-consent role and, thus, should not be allowed.\"). I agree that\nwhether the President shows an improper lack of deference to the Senate in any given circumstance might\nindeed be a political question. But that is not the question we face. We are asked to decide whether the President\n[12]\nexceeded his authority by appointing Judge Pryor.  For the reasons outlined above, the Constitution provides\na clear answer to this question. Therefore we cannot shirk our duty to resolve this matter simply because it may\nhave some political consequences. That a decision may have political consequences certainly does not make it\n1238 non-justiciable *1238 under the political question doctrine. Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 710, 7\n\nL.Ed.2d 663 (1962) (\"The doctrine of which we treat is one of `political questions,' not one of `political cases.' The\ncourts cannot reject as `no law suit' a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated `political'\nexceeds constitutional authority. The cases we have reviewed show the necessity for discriminating inquiry into\nthe precise facts and posture of the particular case, and the impossibility of resolution by any semantic\ncataloguing.\"). See also Chadha, 462 U.S. at 943, 103 S.Ct. 2764 (\"Resolution of litigation challenging the\nconstitutional authority of one of the three branches cannot be evaded by courts because the issues have\npolitical implications\").\nI respectfully dissent.\nWILSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nI dissent from the majority's decision to deny the motion of plaintiffs-appellees to disqualify Judge Pryor. Unlike\nthe majority and Judge Barkett, I would not reach the merits of the issue, and instead would decline to exercise\nour discretion to entertain the motion. For the reasons that follow, I would certify the question to the Supreme\nCourt.\nThe motion, which challenges Judge Pryor's authority to serve as a Circuit Judge on this Court, argues that his\nappointment violated the Recess Appointments Clause. Appellate courts have an obligation to review at any point\nwhether they have jurisdiction, Finn v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc., 821 F.2d 581, 584-85 (11th Cir.1987), but as\nthe majority notes, this issue is not jurisdictional. Majority Op. at 1222, n.1. The Supreme Court has held that\nAppointments Clause objections are \"nonjurisdictional\" and thus are subject to forfeiture and waiver analysis. \nFreytag v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868, 878, 111 S.Ct. 2631, 2639, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991)\n(citations omitted). In Freytag, the Supreme Court chose to address the Appointments Clause challenge before it,\nbut never suggested that it was compelled to do so. In fact, the majority characterized its exercise of its discretion\nin that case as \"rare.\" Id. at 879, 111 S.Ct. at 2639. Four Justices would not have reached the merits of the claim\nat all. See id. at 892, 111 S.Ct. at 2646 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, joined by\nJustices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter).\nOther Supreme Court precedent supports the position that challenges to the composition of a court are non-\njurisdictional. Recently, the Supreme Court dealt with a challenge to the composition of a Court of Appeals panel\nin Nguyen v. United States, 539 U.S. 69, 123 S.Ct. 2130, 156 L.Ed.2d 64 (2003). There, non-Article III judges sat\non the panels that affirmed the petitioners' convictions. The Supreme Court exercised its supervisory power to\ncorrect the error, but did not consider the claim to be jurisdictional. Id. at 74, 123 S.Ct. at 2134.\nAdditionally, this Court thrice previously denied leave to file an amicus curiae brief raising the issue of Judge\nPryor's appointment because the motion to file the brief was untimely. See Adefemi v. Ashcroft, No. 00-15783, \nUnited States v. $242,484.00, No. 01-16485, United States v. Drury, No. 02-12942 (11th Cir. June 10, 2004) (en\nbanc orders). If the issue were jurisdictional, we would have been required to address it (with or without the\nbenefit of amicus curiae). Instead, we declined to consider it because it was not raised in the proper fashion,\napplying ordinary rules of appellate procedure. Because the issue of Judge Pryor's appointment is not a\n[1]\njurisdictional one, we are not obligated to address it.\n1239 *1239 There are compelling reasons why the proper course of action is to decline to exercise our discretion to\naddress this issue. \"A fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid\nreaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.\" Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Ass'n, 485 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 1323, 99 L.Ed.2d 534 (1988). The outcome of the\nunderlying appeal00an important case concerning strip searches and qualified immunity00 does not depend on the\n97 97\nresolution of this motion. We would not have discretion to avoid the close constitutional questions surrounding the\npropriety of Judge Pryor's appointment if they were determinative of an appeal, but that is not the situation facing\n[2]\nus.  Unless and until we cannot avoid the question, notions of judicial restraint counsel against striving to\ndecide constitutional issues. See Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2301,\n2308-09, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004) (discussing similar principles underlying the concept of prudential standing,\nincluding \"[t]he command to guard jealously and exercise rarely our power to make constitutional\npronouncements\").\n\nAnother important concern militates against the majority's decision to reach the merits of the motion. It is simply\ninappropriate for the members of a court to sit in judgment of a colleague's legitimacy. In the only two courts of\nappeals decisions addressing the recess appointment of Article III judges, circuit judges reviewed the\nappointment of district judges. See United States v. Woodley, 751 F.2d 1008 (9th Cir.1985) (en banc); United\nStates v. Allocco, 305 F.2d 704 (2d Cir.1962). The mandate to review lower-court judgments is the fundamental\ncharacteristic of appellate courts. But it is nearly anathema for circuit court judges to review a colleague's\n[3]\nlegitimacy to sit as a member of their court.\nMy specific concern is twofold. First, we risk damaging the collegiality for which this Court is rightly known. Even\nour most vociferous dissents are critiques of a judge's legal reasoning in a particular case, and never (one hopes)\ndevolve into personal rebukes. And while the recess appointment question in the motion before us is, in the\nstrictest sense, a matter of constitutional interpretation that does not depend on the judge involved, it is\ninescapable that this is not a question we can answer in the abstract. A vote in favor of the legal argument\n[4]\npresented in the motion is also a vote against Judge Pryor's membership on our Court.  Moreover, even if such\n1240 a decision *1240 were cast as a ruling that the President overstepped his authority under the Recess\nAppointments Clause, it might also be construed as a judgment that Judge Pryor should not have accepted the\nappointment in the first place.\nImagine the risk to our collegiality if we granted the motion, but Judge Pryor did not accept our ruling. He might\ndecide to file in the Supreme Court a petition for a writ of mandamus compelling us to restore him to the Court. I\nshould stress that I have no doubt that Judge Pryor would do anything but abide by any decision of this Court, but\neven the slightest risk that a judge might sue his colleagues should compel us to make every effort to avoid such\nconfrontations. Because it seems impossible to me to avoid the very personal impact of any decision we make, it\nis neither wise nor prudent for us to make one.\nSecond, we risk public confidence in the judiciary as an institution. As of September, 2004, Judge Pryor has\nauthored 8 published opinions and 42 nonpublished opinions. As of September 30, 2004, Judge Pryor has\nparticipated as a member of a panel in 299 appeals, 40 of which were decided after oral argument. In fact, Judge\nPryor has already sat en banc with the full Court and has participated in en banc decisions. Any decision we\nmake on this motion risks undermining public confidence in the Court. On the one hand, if we grant the motion to\ndisqualify Judge Pryor in this case because he was not validly appointed to the Court, we would necessarily imply\nthat he improperly sat in previous cases. This would instantly call into question every one of those decisions. See\nNguyen, 539 U.S. at 82-83, 123 S.Ct. at 2138-39 (an improperly constituted court of appeals panel required\nreversal of conviction, even though opinion affirming conviction was unanimous, and in some circumstances\ncould have been filed by a two-judge quorum). Although it is not unheard of for us to overturn prior decisions, if\nwe granted the motion the public might reasonably wonder why we allowed so many illegitimate decisions to be\nentered at all.\nConversely, if we deny the motion, the public might reasonably wonder about our motives. I have detailed above\nthe concerns for collegiality that should be present in this case. An observer might assume that a desire to protect\ncollegial relations, or a personal affinity for Judge Pryor developed over the course of his service to our Court,\nmight have weighed in the decision not to remove him. As discussed, the impact of our decision will be very\ndeeply felt by Judge Pryor. Judges are human, and we cannot risk giving the impression that our desire to avoid\nconfrontation and maintain collegiality affected our decision. Because of the problems inherent in sitting in\njudgment of one's colleague, we should avoid imperiling public confidence in the Court.\nAs a final note, I hasten to add that I do not mean to suggest that no one should answer the difficult constitutional\nquestions arising from recess appointments. I merely submit that in the present case, it should not be this Court.\nWhile the common law \"rule of necessity\" would prevent the Supreme Court from avoiding a decision on the\nlegitimacy of a Justice's recess appointment, that rule only applies to courts of last resort or where no judge at all\nwould be available. See United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 212-216, 101 S.Ct. 471, 479-81, 66 L.Ed.2d 392\n(1980) (discussing the history and application of the rule of necessity). The rule does not apply when recourse\nmay be had in a higher court. Such is the case before us. The Supreme Court can address the merits of the\n\nrecess appointment issue free of the concerns facing us if we pass judgment on a colleague. Just as we sit in\n1241 review of the *1241 district courts, so the Supreme Court sits in review of us.\nIn light of the unique00indeed, unprecedented 00circumstances of this motion to rule on the legitimacy of a\n97 97\ncolleague's presidential appointment, the most prudent course for us to take is to decline to reach the merits of\nthe motion. Instead, as Judge Barkett suggests, we should certify the question to the Supreme Court pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1254(2) (2000). See Dissenting Op. of Judge Barkett at 1228 n.1; see also United States v.\n[5]\nPenaranda, 375 F.3d 238, 247 (2d Cir.2004) (certifying questions to the Supreme Court).  From the majority's\ndecision to address the merits of the motion, I respectfully dissent.\n[*] Judge Carnes and Judge Pryor, having recused themselves on the question of Judge Pryor's appointment, did\nnot participate in the consideration or decision of the motion to disqualify Judge Pryor.\n[1] We do not view the question of the constitutionality of Judge Pryor's appointment as affecting jurisdiction and,\nthus, requiring this Court to act sua sponte. We have rejected the argument that the Supreme Court's recent\ndecision in Nguyen v. United States, 539 U.S. 69, 123 S.Ct. 2130, 156 L.Ed.2d 64 (2003), directs us to view this\nchallenge to Judge Pryor's appointment as jurisdictional. There, the Supreme Court merely exercised its power to\ncorrect a statutory violation by the Ninth Circuit when the Circuit Court allowed a non-Article III judge to sit on a\nthree-judge panel. The Court granted the litigant permission to appeal the issue (which had not been raised in\nearlier proceedings) based on its Rule 10(a) \"supervisory power,\" not because the Court considered the issue as\njurisdictional. \nIn addition, the Supreme Court's decision in Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868, 111\nS.Ct. 2631, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991), characterized Recess Appointments Clause objections as \"nonjurisdictional\nstructural constitutional objections.\" Id. at 2639 (viewing whether to address such a structural constitutional\nobjection, despite the litigant's failure to raise the issue in lower court proceedings, as being within the Court's \ndiscretion).\nThis motion is the first instance00that was both timely and ripe00in which a party objected, on account of Judge\n97 97\nPryor's recess appointment, to his taking part in a decision as a judge of this Court.\n[2] We do not have before us and do not address a circumstance in which the Senate, itself, is a litigant\nchallenging a President's act. One distinguished member of the Senate, Senator Kennedy, is acting as amicus\ncuriae, supporting plaintiff-appellees' challenge of Judge Pryor.\n[3] The sequence of the relevant clauses is important. The pertinent text of Article II, Section 2, Clauses 2 and 3\nreads this way: \n\"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint\nAmbassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the\nUnited States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by\nLaw....\"\nU.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2.\n\"The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by\ngranting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\"\nU.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 3. (emphasis added).\n[4] There are (and always have been) few Article III judgeships for the whole country. Therefore, because an\nArticle III judge's power cannot be delegated to other people in the way most powers of executive branch officers\ncan be, judicial vacancies are especially hurtful to the judicial branch and, in turn, to its ability to serve the nation\nand its people. That the Framers would have been as concerned with keeping judicial offices filled as keeping\nexecutive offices filled makes sense.\n\n[5] For example, Alexander Hamilton described the Recess Appointments Clause as \"establishing an auxiliary\nmethod of appointment in cases, to which the general method was inadequate.\" The Federalist No. 67, at 455\n(Alexander Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961). Sometimes, filling a vacancy should not be put off. As\nHamilton wrote, \"it might be necessary for the public service [for the President] to fill [vacancies] without delay.\" \nId.\n[6] To our knowledge, Congress has never attempted to diminish the pay of a recess-appointment judge while he\nwas in office. Whether such an attempt would be constitutional is itself an open question.\n[7] By the way, the Constitution does not limit a term of Congress to two Sessions. One Congress had four\nSessions. And several, including the first, had three Sessions. Therefore, even if the phrase \"the Recess of the\nSenate\" meant only recesses between the Sessions of the Congress (which we do not accept), there could easily\nbe more than one such recess per Congress.\n[8] For example, President Clinton appointed a judge to the Court of Federal Claims during an intrasession\neleven-day recess. President Clinton made another recess appointment during an intrasession nine-day recess.\nPresident Reagan and President Coolidge made appointments during intrasession breaks of no more than\nthirteen-days. H. Hogue, Congressional Research Service, Intrasession Recess Appointments CRS-7-CRS-29\n(April 23, 2004).\n[9] For example, President Nixon appointed three Judges to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals during an\nintrasession 32-day recess. And President Truman appointed several District Court Judges during an intrasession\n35-day recess. H. Hogue, Congressional Research Service, Intrasession Recess Appointments CRS-9-CRS-21\n(April 23, 2004).\n[10] In fact, over the course of this nation's history, the Senate has effectively taken zero-day intersession\nrecesses (at least in 1867 and 1903, the Senate did not break for an intersession recess); and the Senate has\ntaken intrasession recesses lasting months, including one of nearly 5 months (7 August 1948 through 31\nDecember 1948).\n[11] That Congress is willing, under certain circumstances, to pay recess appointees filling vacancies that had\nexisted while the Senate was in Session suggests to us that it is the view of the majority of Congress that the\nPresident's making of such appointments is likely not unconstitutional. To interpret the statute's significance any\nother way would seem to attribute to Congress an intent to countenance what they saw as an unlawful practice.\n[12] We do not agree that the different language of Article I, Section 3, Clause 2 (addressing the filling of Senate\nvacancies during recesses of state legislatures) shows that what has long been the common interpretation of the\nRecess Appointments Clause is wrong. Nor do we agree that Hamilton's capitalization or italicization of the words\n\"during the recess of the Senate\" in Federalist 67 and 76 indicates that the vacancy to be filled (as opposed to\nthe appointment itself) must occur in the recess.\n[13] Plaintiff-appellees also have moved to disqualify Judge Pryor based on his service as the Attorney General\nof the State of Alabama at the time of the Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002)\ndecision and on his comments00made before his appointment to this Court and before his taking the oath of office\n97\nas a judge00about the outcome of that case. This aspect of the motion to disqualify approaches being frivolous. \n97\nHope involved different parties and a different set of material facts than are present in this case. In addition, all or\nalmost all judges were advocates on one side or another of many controversies before becoming judges. When\nthey become judges, they take on an altogether different job and swear to judge \"impartially.\" Mere\nrepresentation and opinions about a previous unrelated matter 00especially made before one took the oath of\n97\noffice00do not disqualify a judge. See, e.g., United States v. Outler, 659 F.2d 1306, 1312 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981),\n97\noverruled on other grounds by United States v. Steele, 147 F.3d 1316 (11th Cir.1998) (en banc). Judge Pryor's\nstatements made as Alabama's Attorney General do not disqualify him as a judge in this Georgia case.\n[14] We considered certifying to the Supreme Court the question of the validity of Judge Pryor's recess\nappointment. We, however, decided against that course largely because we believed our ruling on the matter\nwould almost certainly be a speedier determination. We think that a speedier determination is best for the Court,\n\nfor Judge Pryor, and for the parties that come before this Court. Had we certified the question, we had no way of\nknowing when the Supreme Court might get to rule on it or even if they would take the question at all. In the\nmeantime, everyone concerned would be in a kind of legal limbo. Furthermore, it is not the nature of this Court of\nAppeals to blink because a case is hard or sensitive. As the Supreme Court has said, it is the \"task\" of a Court of\nAppeals \"to decide all properly presented cases coming before it...\" Wisniewski v. United States, 353 U.S. 901,\n77 S.Ct. 633, 634, 1 L.Ed.2d 658 (1957) (dismissing certification). Now that we have ruled, the Supreme Court, of\ncourse, can decide for itself (and on a schedule of its own choosing) whether the issue is important enough or\nclose enough to justify their limited time and energy in its consideration. \nThe public has no good reason to doubt the impartiality of our decision: our own offices are not at stake in this\ncase; we have no financial interest in the outcome; and we did not select or appoint Judge Pryor to sit on this\nCourt. We recognize that our associate Judge Pryor has an interest in the motion, but even the naming of a\njudicial colleague as a defendant in litigation (and Judge Pryor is not a defendant here) does not require\nautomatic disqualification of every judge on the same court. Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, Vol. II,\nCh. IV, Published Advisory Opinion No. 103(II)(B) (2002). In addition, on the question of the constitutionality of\nJudge Pryor's appointment, several factors point toward our going forward to decide this case: (1) the issue\nconcerns solely the President's recess appointment power and bears no relation to Judge Pryor's personal\nconduct or credibility; (2) even as to the narrow issue of the President's appointment power, the motion raises\npurely legal, constitutional issues based on undisputed facts and does not involve discretion or any fact-finding by\nthis Court; (3) the motion raises mainly an issue affecting all recess appointments and not only Judge Pryor's\nappointment; (4) Judge Pryor is not a party to this case and has himself voluntarily recused from participating in\nthis motion to disqualify; and (5) as noted above, our prompt resolution of this issue, as opposed to certification,\nbest serves sound judicial administration.\nBy the way, no one has sought to disqualify any or all of the Article III judges of this Court from deciding this\nmotion.\n[1] It is difficult for any of us to sit in judgment on the constitutionality of a colleague's appointment. I would have\npreferred to certify this question directly to the Supreme Court per 28 U.S.C. § 1254(2), or to request that the\nSupreme Court appoint another court to hear the matter. Since the court has chosen to answer the question\ninstead, I too address it.\n[2] The majority unnecessarily renders a decision as to the third question, finding that \"the Recess\" is ambiguous\nenough to encompass both inter-session and intra-session recesses. Although I would not reach this question,\nthe text of the Constitution as well as the weight of the historical record strongly suggest that the Founders meant\nto denote only inter-session recesses. The textual point does not require much explanation. Had the Framers\nintended to include intra-session as well as inter-session recesses, they could very easily have used the phrase\n\"during a recess of the Senate.\" They chose instead to adopt a singular construction: \"the Recess of the Senate\"\n(emphasis added). In addition, they capitalized the term \"Recess,\" which suggests particularity rather than\ngenerality, formal rather than generic meaning. \nThese textual considerations are reinforced by the fact that early American legislators were forced to interrupt the\nwork that provided their primary source of income and to travel slowly over long distances to a legislative seat.\nThe Framers' use of the singular construction \"the Recess\" must be situated within this historical context.\nThe earliest congressional and presidential papers bear out this interpretation of the phrase \"the Recess.\" See,\nfor example, Journal of the Executive Proceedings of the Senate of the United States of America, 1789-1805\n(February 9, 1790), at http://memory.loc.gov /ammem/amlaw/lawhome.html (last visited September 28, 2004)\n(Senate postponing consideration, early in the second session of the first Congress, of President Washington's\nmessage \"relative to `certain persons who decline the acceptance of offices, and to certain temporary\nappointments during the recess'\"); President George Washington's Fifth Annual Message to Congress\n(December 3, 1793), at http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/sou/washs05.htm (last visited September\n29, 2004) (noting, on the day after the third Congress convened to begin its first session, that the Creek Indians\n\"have been relieved with corn and with clothing, and offensive measures against them prohibited during the\nrecess of Congress\"); and Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 1789-1873 (May 23, 1794), at\nhttp:// memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lawhome.html (last visited September 28, 2004) (Senate adoption of\n\nseveral amendments to a bill authorizing the President, \"during the recess of the present Congress, to cause to\nbe purchased or built a number of vessels, to be equipped as galleys in the service of the United States\").\n[3] On both occasions in which the text of the Recess Appointments Clause is quoted in The Federalist Papers,\nthe phrase \"during the recessof the Senate\" is emphasized. See The Federalist No. 67, at 390 (Alexander\nHamilton) (Isaac Kramnick ed., 1987) (\"The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen \nduring the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.\");\nand The Federalist No. 76, at 428 (Alexander Hamilton) (Isaac Kramnick ed., 1987) (\"The President shall have\npower to fill up all vacancies which may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which\nshall expire at the end of their next session.\"). The majority's interpretation of the clause would attribute little if\nany meaning to the emphasis that Alexander Hamilton places on the term \"during\" in these two papers. If\nanything, Hamilton's emphasis on the phrase \"during the recess of the Senate\" is inconsistent with the majority's\ninterpretation, which would give the President the power to fill vacancies that occur even when the Senate is in\nsession. By contrast, a reading of the clause that limits the President's power to only those vacancies that occur\nwhile the Senate is in recess seems much more faithful to Hamilton's emphasis on the word \"during\" here.\n[4] The OED entry goes on to describe \"happen\" as the \"most general verb to express the simple occurrence of\nan event.\" All of the eighteenth-century English dictionaries that I have consulted, including all those printed in\nAmerica, support this reading of the term \"happen.\" Thus, Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language\n(published in London in 1755) defines \"happen\" as \"to fall out; to chance; to come to pass.\" William Perry's Royal\nStandard English Dictionary (published in London in 1775, in America in 1788) defines \"happen\" as \"to come to\npass, to light on.\" Thomas Sheridan's Complete Dictionary of the English Language (published in London in\n1780, where it first appeared as General Dictionary of the English Language, in America in 1789) defines\n\"happen\" as \"to fall out by chance; to light on by accident.\" John Entick's New Spelling Dictionary of the English\nLanguage (published in London in 1764, in America in 1800) defines \"happen\" as \"to fall out, come to pass,\nchance.\" John Walker's Critical Pronouncing Dictionary and Expositor of the English Language (published in\nLondon in 1791, in America in 1803) defines \"happen\" as \"to fall out by chance, to come to pass; to light on by\naccident.\" Samuel Johnson, Jr. and John Elliott's Selected Pronouncing and Accented Dictionary (published in\nAmerica in 1800) defines \"happen\" as \"to fall out, come to pass.\" Caleb Alexander's Columbian Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language (published in America in 1800) defines \"happen\" as \"to fall out, to light on.\" Finally, Noah\nWebster's Compendious Dictionary of the English Language (published in America in 1806), also known as\n\"Webster's First Dictionary,\" defines \"happen\" as \"to fall out, come to pass, chance.\" \nTo the extent that these definitions differ from today's usage, it is not insofar as they suggest that \"exist\" was a\nrecognized synonym for \"happen,\" for that comparison is nowhere made in any of the above dictionaries. Rather,\nthe difference is that the eighteenth-century definitions suggest a somewhat more pronounced emphasis on the\nelement of chance or fortuity, an emphasis entirely consistent with the plain meaning of the Recess Appointments\nClause.\nThe majority's response to all of this evidence is simply to note that \"happen\" in today's usage can also mean\n\"befall,\" which can also mean \"happen to be.\" See Majority Order at 1225-26. This is at best a strained effort to\navoid the available dictionary evidence, and with it the plain meaning rule. A cross-reference is not a direct\ndefinition, and this reference comes from a contemporary and not an eighteenth-century dictionary. The majority\nprovides no direct evidence from either contemporary or eighteenth-century dictionaries00and no evidence at all\n97\nfrom any eighteenth-century dictionaries00that \"happen\" can mean \"exist.\"\n97\n[5]See also William Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States 162-67 (2nd ed. 1829) (quoted in\nRalph Lerner and Philip Kerner, eds., The Founders' Constitution (1987), vol. 4 at 115) (\"It would be improper to\npass over the construction given by the senate to the power of appointing during their recess. It has been held by\nthat venerable body, that if new offices are created by congress, the president cannot, after the adjournment of\nthe senate, make appointments to fill them. The vacancies do not happen during the recess of the senate.\")\n(emphasis in the original); and S.Rep. No. 37-80, at 3-6 (3d. Sess.1863) (rejecting the argument that the term\n\"happen\" in the Recess Appointments Clause can be construed to mean \"happen to exist\").\n[6] Hamilton's purpose in this paper was to rebut the allegation that the Constitution would have allowed the\nPresident, rather than the governors of the states, to fill vacancies in the Senate.\n\n[7] 3 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution § 1551 (1833) (quoted in Ralph Lerner and Philip Kerner,\neds., The Founders' Constitution (1987), vol. 4 at 122).\n[8] It is also worth noting that Woodley makes selective and somewhat misleading use of the various eighteenth-\ncentury dictionary definitions of \"happen\" quoted in footnote 1 above. See Woodley, 751 F.2d at 1013 n. 8. The\neffect is to minimize the extent to which those definitions suggest that \"happen\" meant \"to occur\" or \"take place\"\neven in the eighteenth century, and not merely in \"modern\" usage.\n[9]See S.Rep. No. 37-80 at 3-6 (3d. Sess.1863) (explaining the rationale for the law now known as 5 U.S.C. §\n5503 and rejecting the argument that the term \"happen\" in the Recess Appointments Clause can be construed to\nmean \"happen to exist\").\n[10] The statute does not apply: \n(1) if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session of the Senate;\n(2) if, at the end of the session, a nomination for the office, other than the nomination of an individual appointed\nduring the preceding recess of the Senate, was pending before the Senate for its advice and consent; or\n(3) if a nomination for the office was rejected by the Senate within 30 days before the end of the session and an\nindividual other than the one whose nomination was rejected thereafter receives a recess appointment.\n5 U.S.C. § 5503(a)(1-3). It also provides that any nomination to fill a vacancy described in one of those three\nexceptions \"shall be submitted to the Senate not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the\nSenate.\" 5 U.S.C. § 5503(b). As the majority also fails to acknowledge, none of the three exceptions applies to\nthe instant case.\n[11]Compare Rev. Stat. § 1761 as amended by 43 Stat. 669 (Act of June 7, 1924) with 54 Stat. 751 (1940). By\ncontrast, the prohibition on payment of salaries to individuals appointed to fill vacancies that existed while the\nSenate was in session dates back to 1863. See 12 Stat. 646 (Act of February 9, 1863).\n[12] I note that the majority first claims that the motion somehow raises a separable \"political question.\" However,\nwhen it comes to explaining why the court chose not to certify the question to the Supreme Court, the majority\nargues that \"the motion raises purely legal, constitutional issues.\" Majority Order at 1228 n.14.\n[1] The only circuit courts to have addressed the recess appointments of Article III judges diverge on this point.\nThe Second Circuit did not consider the issue to be jurisdictional. United States v. Allocco, 305 F.2d 704, 707-08\n& n. 8 (2d Cir.1962) (permitting a \"departure\" from normal waiver rules). The Ninth Circuit raised the issue sua\nsponte because it felt the question was a \"jurisdictional problem[].\" United States v. Woodley, 751 F.2d 1008,\n1009 n. 2 (9th Cir.1985) (en banc). If, as I suggest, we were to certify the matter to the Supreme Court, one of the\nquestions certified could be whether the challenge at issue is jurisdictional.\n[2] I can envision situations in which the propriety of Judge Pryor's appointment would be the determinative\nquestion, but I need not expound upon those situations here.\n[3] The only instance where we sit in judgment of each other's opinions is when the en banc court overturns a\nprior court decision. But even on these rare occasions, we do not review the prior court's legitimacy. Ordinarily, of\ncourse, panels of the Court are bound by a prior panel's decision. Although the reason for this is stare decisis, it\nalso prevents a great deal of disharmony that might result if panels of the Court were constantly overturning each\nother's decisions.\n[4] Indeed, one portion of the motion is not abstract at all, but asserts that this particular appointment is\nunconstitutional. See Majority Op. at 1226-27 (determining that this issue is a non-justiciable political question).\n[5] The Second Circuit in Penaranda certified to the Supreme Court questions arising from the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Blakely v. Washington, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Crucial to the Second\nCircuit's decision was that Blakely impacted so many criminal cases, and efficient administration of justice\nrequired prompt answers to questions about the scope of Blakely. Similar concerns are present here. As noted,\n\nevery case involving Judge Pryor is cast into doubt until the questions presented in the motion are finally settled\nby the Supreme Court. The sooner it rules on the validity of Judge Pryor's appointment, the better. Certification\nnot only allows us to avoid sitting in judgment of a colleague's legitimacy, it also facilitates Supreme Court\nconsideration of the issue as soon as possible, to the benefit of both this Court and litigants before it. The\nmajority contends that its decision today is the \"speedier determination.\" Majority Op. at ____ n.14. To the\ncontrary, I believe that the most rapid course we could have taken would have been to certify the matter as soon\nas the motion was originally filed. The Supreme Court would likely have decided whether to accept certification\nsooner than it would take to decide a petition for certiorari following our decision.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

First, amici\nare named Defendants-Appellants in Hicks v. Moore, et al., a lawsuit filed in\nthe Northern District of Georgia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, based on a strip\nsearch and other alleged conduct associated with the detention of Plaintiff-\nAppellee Janet Hicks. Hicks was a pretrial detainee arrested in April 2001\nfor family violence battery, and placed in the Habersham County Detention\nCenter's general jail population overnight. Hicks v. Moore, et al. is\npresently on interlocutory appeal to this Court from the district court's denial\nof qualified immunity to amici, and denial of official immunity to amicus\nHighfill. Hicks v. Moore, et al., 11th Circuit Docket No. 03-136861-II.\nAmici understand that the panel that heard oral argument in Hicks intends to\nhold its decision until after en banc disposition of the present appeal.\nSecond, Sheriff Moore, Captain Ausburn and Sergeant Gosnell have\n\nthe ongoing responsibility to administer the Habersham County Detention\nCenter so as to protect the safety of their employees, the prisoners in their\ncustody (both pretrial detainees and convicts) and the security of the facility\nin general. Therefore, they have an interest in the issues presented.\nAmici seek leave of Court to file this Brief, pursuant to their Motion\nto File Amicus Curiae Brief filed simultaneously herewith. By letter dated\nApril 27, 2004 from En Banc Case Manager Matt Davidson, these parties\nwere invited by the Court to petition for leave to file this Brief.\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\nThe issues posed by this Court for en banc review are:\nI. Whether arrestees who are to be detained in the general jail\npopulation can constitutionally be subjected to a strip search only if\nthe search is supported by reasonable suspicion that such a search\nwill reveal weapons or contraband; (emphasis in original)\nII. Whether the manner in which the searches in this case were conducted\nviolated the clearly-established constitutional rights of plaintiffs so that\nofficer Stephens is not entitled to qualified immunity.\nAMICI HEREIN ADDRESS ONLY THE FIRST ISSUE,\nw\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThis Court should permit arrestees who are to be detained in the\ngeneral jail population to be strip searched in the manner described in Bell v.\nWolfish. 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979) and Justice v. City of Peachtree\nc_c___v9,61 F.2d 188, 193 (11 thCir. 1992), regardless whether the search is\nsupported by reasonable suspicion that such a search will reveal weapons or\ncontraband. Jail officers of the same sex should be able to perform a visual,\nnonintrusive unclothed search, in a private area, to ensure that arrestees who\nare to be detained in a general jail population do not carry concealed\nweapons, drugs or contraband into the jail population.\nIn Bell the Supreme Court struck the proper balance between\ninstitutional security and the extremely attenuated Fourth Amendment\nprivacy rights of general jail population pretrial detainees, and declined to\nimpose a \"reasonable suspicion\" requirement. This case presents a more\ncompelling.ground for a strip search than Bell. Whereas Bell considered\nincarcerated pretrial detainees who were strip searched after contact visits,\njailers, like the officer in this case, face detainees fresh off the street. The\ndetainees were \"unknown quantities,\" who (unlike the Bell prisoners) had\nnot been subject to the security measures of a jail facility. While it may be\ntempting to speculate that charges or circumstances of arrest bear some\n\n0\nrelationship to the probability that a pretrial detainee may have weapons or\ncontraband, there is no necessary logical connection, and the Supreme Court\n0\nhas rejected such speculative Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. United\nStates v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 234-35, 94 S.Ct. 467, 476 (1973); Bell,\n441 U.S. at 546 n. 28 (\"There is no basis for concluding that pretrial\ndetainees pose any lesser security risk than convicted inmates. Indeed, it\nmay be that in certain circumstances they present a greater risk to jail\nsecurity and order.\").\nAdditionally, the Supreme Court recognizes that law enforcement\nofficers, the public and pretrial detainees alike are best guided by clear,\nconsistent rules, rather than vague standards--particularly in highly\nrecurrent yet diverse factual scenarios where the Fourth Amendment is\n0\nimplicated. In the general jail population context, jail officers must make\ncritical security decisions regarding searches of pretrial detainees, keeping in\nmind the duties to safeguard officers, duties to general population inmates,\nand the security of the facility. Presently, they must also consider whether\nthere is \"reasonable suspicion\" to search the detainee. Given the lack of\nclarity regarding what \"reasonable suspicion\" means in this context, all\nofficers and policymakers have a strong disincentive to permit e en\nD\n4\n\nconstitutional strip searches, thus compromising officer and prisone: safety\nand jail security.\n0\nIn short, Bell v. Wolfish, which permits limited visual strip\nof general population pretrial detainees without reasonable icion,\nprovides the bright line rule that is needed in this circumstance. 9r the\nlimited context of general population strip searches, there is no\n0\nreason to deviate from Bel___lby imposing a \"'reasonable suspi\nO\nrequirement.\n0\nD\nD\nD\nD\n|\nD\nD\nh\n\nARGUMENT AND CITATIONS TO AUTHORITY\nINTRODUCTION\nThis Brief addresses only the first issue for en bane review,\nspecifically:\nWhether arrestees who are to be detained in the general jail\npopulation can constitutionally be subjected to a strip search only\ni_f the search is supported by reasonable suspicion that such a\nsearch will reveal weapons or contraband.\nThese amici answer in the negative. Specifically, amici submit that the\nCourt should adopt the rule that jail officials may perform the nonintrusive\nvisual searches described in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979) and Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193\n(11 th Cir. 1992), on pretrial detainees before their entry into a general jail\npopulation--without a requirement of particularized reasonable suspicion--\nfor purposes of safety and security.\nI. THE \"REASONABLE SUSPICION\" STANDARD FOR\nGENERAL POPULATION PRETRIAL DETAINEES\nSUBSTANTIALLY COMPROMISES JAIL SECURITY AND\nUNDULY RESTRICTS A REASONABLE LAW\nENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE\nThe Supreme Court's controlling opinion regarding strip searches of\npretrial detainees is Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979). In\nBell, the Supreme Court upheld a jail policy that required visual unclothed\nI\nbody cavity searches of general population pretrial detainees after contact\n\nvisits from outside parties. Id__a_t. 560. On first glance, Bel__lprovides only\nguidelines for general population strip searches:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not\ncapable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each\ncase it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal fights that the search entails.\nCourts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the\nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it,\nand the place in which it is conducted.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 559. _ Close analysis, however, reveals that Bell's holding\ncontrols the first en bane issue.\nThe Supreme Court's holding in Bell v. Wolfish, under factually\nconcrete circumstances, provides the clear, controlling rule that strikes the\nproper balance between a general population pretrial detainee's individual\nfights and jail security. Bell permitted the following type of strip search of\ngeneral population pretrial detainees, without imposing a \"reasonable\nsuspicion\" standard:\nIf the inmate is a male, he must lift his genitals and bend over to\nspread his buttocks for visual inspection. The vaginal and anal\ncavities of female inmates also are visually inspected. The inmate\nImportantly, Bell cites a number of cases for this proposition,\nincluding United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct. 3074\n(1976), United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574 (1975)\nand Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968)--all of which recognize\na Fourth Amendment \"reasonable suspicion\" standard. Yet the Bell Court\nimplicitly rejected Justice Powell's call for imposition of a \"reasonable\nsuspicion\" requirement on visual body cavity searches. Bell., 441 U.S. at\n563 (Powell, J., dissenting in part).\nD\n\nis not touched by security personal at any time during the visual\nsearch procedure.\nId. at 558 n. 39 (emphasis in original). 2This Court has no compelling cause\nto depart from Bell by requiting a \"reasonable suspicion\" showing.\nThe Supreme Court acknowledged that the Fourth Amendment rights\nof general population pretrial detainees are no different from those of\nconvicted prisoners. 3\nLawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or\nlimitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by\nthe considerations underlying our penal system. The fact of\nO. confinement as well as the legitimate goals and policies of the\n2 See also Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11 th\nCir. 1992):\nThe officers limited the search in the following manner: (1) having\nmembers of the same sex perform the search, (2) using a room\nwhere only the participants were present to conduct the search, and\n(3) limited the search to exclude body cavities. Without doubt, the\nofficers conducted the strip search in the least intrusive manner.\n3 The Seventh Circuit has concluded that convicted prisoners have no\nsubstantial Fourth Amendment right to be free from strip searches. Peckham\nv. Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections, 141 F.3d 694, 697(7 th Cir. 1998)\n(\"[G]iven the considerable deference prison officials enjoy to run their\ninstitutions it is difficult to conjure up too many real-life scenarios where\nprison strip searches of inmates could be said to be unreasonable under the\nFourth Amendment.\"); see also Cornwell v. Dahlberg, 963 F.2d 912, 916-\n17 (6'h Cir. 1992) (finding that convict's Fourth Amendment strip search\nclaim should be measured by the deferential standard of Turner v. Safely,\n482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2261 (1987): \"when a prison regulation\nimpinges on inmates' constitutional tights, the regulation is valid if it is\nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\").\n\npenal institution limits these retained constitutional rights. There\nmust be a mutual accommodation between institutional needs and\nobjectives andthe provisions of the Constitution that areof general\napplication. This principle applies equally to pretrial detainees\nand convicted prisoners. A detainee simply does not possessthe\nfull range of freedoms of an unincarcerated individual.\nBell, 441 U.S at 545-46 (citations and internal quotations omitted).\nMoreover, \"given the realities of institutional confinement, any reasonable\nexpectation of privacy that a detainee retained necessarily would be of a\ndiminished scope[.]\" Id__a_t_5.57. Finally, \"[a pretrial detainee's presumption\nof innocence] has no application to a determination of the rights of a pretrial\ndetainee during confinement before his trial has even begun.\" Id. at 533.\nThe Supreme Court also recognized that a general population pretrial\ndetainee's limited range of freedoms are retracted in light of the\ngovernmental interests at stake in prison administration.\n[M]aintaining institutional security and preserving internal\norder and discipline are essential goals that may require\nlimitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of\nboth convieted prisoners and pretrial detainees. Central to all\nother corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal\nsecurity within the corrections facilities themselves. Prison\nofficials must be free to take appropriate action to ensure the safety\nof inmates and corrections personnel and to prevent escape or\nunauthorized entry. Accordingly, we have held that even when an\ninstitutional restriction infringes a specific constitutional\nguarantee, such as the First Amendment, the practice must be\nevaluated in the light of the central objective of prison\nadministration, safeguarding institutional security.\nBel___4_4!,1 U.S at 546-47 (citations, internal quotations and footnote omitted);\n\nsee also id. at 540 (\"[T]he Government must be able to take steps to\nmaintain security and order at the institution and make certain no weapons\nor illicit drugs reach detainees.\"); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 527-28,\n104 S.Ct. 3194, 3201 (1984) (\"A fight of privacy in traditional Fourth\nAmendment terms is fundamentally incompatible with the close and\ncontinual surveillance of inmates and their cells required to ensure\ninstitutional security and internal order.\").\nIt is no secret that jail officers cannot see razor blades, LSD 'hits',\ncrack rocks, hacksaw blades, and other contraband that is easily concealed\nbeneath clothing and evades a standard patdown search: Whereas Bell dealt\nwith strip searches of inmates administered after contact visits, the officer in\nthe present case (and jailers in the Eleventh Circuit generally) had to deal\nwith pretrial detainees fresh from the street. Accordingly, this case poses\neven stronger security and contraband concerns than Bell, where strip\nsearches were upheld without a \"reasonable suspicion\" requirement.\nThis Court may be encouraged by the appellees to indulge a view that\npersons arrested for traffic offenses or other minor violations---charges that\n4 \"Where an arrestee is wearing blue jeans or another heavy material,\neven the most thorough pat-down search will not necessarily turn up small\nitems such as several hits of LSD on postage stamps, a small rock of crack\ncocaine, or a razor blade.\" Kraushaar v. Flanigan, 45 F.3d 1040, 1046 (7th\nCir. 1995).\nI\n10\n\ndo not suggest weapons or contraband--have little or no probability of\nsecreting weapons or other problematic materials into a general jail\npopulation. But charges or circumstances of arrest bear no necessary\nrelationship to the level of danger posed by a pretrial detainee. For example,\n\"Al Capone ... was nailed for income-tax evasion, not for the bootlegging,\nloan-sharking, extortion, and prostitution that generated the income,\" United\nStates v. Ytem, 255 F.3d 394, 397 (7 th Cir. 2001), nor for the bloody mob\nactivities for which he is infamous.\nMoreover, the Supreme Court long ago rejected a Fourth Amendment\njurisprudence of speculation regarding the probability that a detainee may\npossess weapons.\nNor are inclined [sic], on the basis of what seems to us to be a\nrather speculative judgment, to qualify the breadth of the general\nauthority to search incident to a lawful custodial arrest on an\nassumption that persons arrested for the offense of driving while\ntheir licenses have been revoked are less likely to possess\ndangerous weapons than are those arrested for other crimes. It is\nscarcely open to doubt that the danger to an officer is far\ngreater in the case of the extended exposure which follows the\ntaking of a suspect into custody and transporting him to the\npolice station than in the case of the relatively fleeting contact\nresulting from the typical Terry-type stop.\nUnited States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 234-35, 94 S.Ct. 467, 476 (1973)\n(emphasis supplied).\nSimilarly, \"it is scarcely open to doubt\" that pretrial detainees who are\n11\n\ndangerous in the back of an officer's patrol vehicle, remain dangerous when\nset loose in a general jail population. In fact, they are more dangerous when\nunrestrained and surrounded by potential accomplices (or victims, whichever\nthe case may be) in a general jail population. See also Bell, 441 U.S. at 546\nn. 28 (\"There is no basis for concluding that pretrial detainees pose any\nlesser security risk than convicted inmates. Indeed, it may be that in certain\ncircumstances they present a greater risk to jail security and order.\").\nII. THE PUBLIC, PRETRIAL DETAINEES, AND JAIL\nOFFICIALS ARE BEST SERVED BY A BRIGHT LINE RULE\nTHAT PERMITS THE GENERAL POPULATION INMATE\nSEARCHES DESCRIBED IN BELL v. WOLFISH\nThe Supreme Court recognizes that clear rules are highly desirable in\nthe Fourth Amendment context. \"[W]e have traditionally recognized that a\nresponsible Fourth Amendment balance is not well served by standards\nrequiring sensitive, case-by-case determinations of government need, lest\nevery discretionary judgment in the field be converted into an occasion for\nconstitutional review.\" Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 347,\n121 S.Ct. 1536, 1553 (2001).\nElsewhere, the Supreme Court has stated that \" '[a] highly\nsophisticated set of [Fourth Amendment] rules, qualified by all sorts of ifs,\nands, and buts and requiring the drawing of subtle nuances and hairline\n12\n\ndistinctions, may be the sort of heady stuff upon which the facile minds of\nlawyers and judges eagerly feed, but they may be 'literally impossible of\napplication by the officer in the field.' \"' New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454,\n458, 10I S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981) (quoting LaFave, \"Case-By-\nCase Adjudication\" Versus \"Standardized Procedures\"\" The Robinson\nDilemma, 1974 S.Ct.Rev. 127, 141).\nIndeed, \"the protection of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\n'can only be realized if the police are acting under a set of rules which, in\nmost instances, makes it possible to reach a correct determination\nbeforehand as to whether an invasion of privacy is justified in the interest of\nlaw enforcement.' \" Id__(_q.uoting LaFave, 1974 S.Ct.Rev. at 142). See also\nUnited States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477 (1973)\n(adopting a clear, uniform Fourth Amendment search rule, and stating \"how\nand where to search the person of a suspect whom [an officer] has arrested is\nnecessarily a quick ad hoc judgment which the Fourth Amendment does not\nrequire to be broken down in each instance.\").\nIt is also pertinent to observe that most jail officers are not legal\nscholars, and cannot readily understand and apply arcane legal distinctions\nand vague standards. \"A single, familiar standard is essential to guide police\nI\nIIF\nofficers, who have only limited time and expertise to reflect on and balance\n13\n\n0\nthe social and individual interests involved in the specific circumstances\nthey confront.\" Dunawav v. New York, 442 U.S. 200, 213-214, 99 S.Ct.\n2248, 2256-57 (1979). \"[D]efendant [officers] are not usually lawyers and\n... they do not have 'familiarity with the contents of the Federal Reporter.' \"\nLintz v. Skipski, 25 F.3d 304, 305-06 (6 th Cir. 1994) (quoting Davis v.\nHolly, 835 F.2d 1175 (6thCir.1987)).\nAccordingly, a bright line rule that permits limited, reasonable strip\nsearches of general population pretrial detainees is the best way to protect\njail workers and general population inmates, particularly in light of the\nD serious safety and inmate control concerns that mark prison administration.\nJail officials must make difficult security decisions under uncertain\ncircumstances, and therefore need to be able to perform limited strip\nsearches of general population inmates without the fear that they will be\nsecond-guessed in a subsequent legal proceeding. A few of the many\nconcerns that face jailers are as follows.\n\"The administration of a prison ... is 'at best an extraordinarily difficult\nundertaking.' \" Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 527, 104 S.Ct. 3194,\n3200 (1984) (quoting Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 566, 94 S.Ct.\n2963, 2979 (1974)).\nA detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security\ndangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other\n14\n\ncontraband is all too common an occurrence. And inmate attempts\nto secrete these items into the facility by concealing them in body\ncavities are documented in this record, App. 71-76, and in other\ncases.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 559.\nJail officials must manage general population inmates while outnumbered\nand facing a variety of competing constitutional and institutional mandates,\nincluding protecting society, themselves, and the inmates. Smith v. Sullivan,\n553 F.2d 373, 380 (5'h Cir. 1977) (\"Primary responsibility of jails is to\nprotect society from those considered dangerous. Likewise inmates must be\nprotected from each other. Sufficient security is therefore a necessity for any\njail.\").\nIn addition to multiple levels and types of physical protection, jailers\nmust provide inmates with, inter alia, basic necessities, medical care, First\nAmendment protections and due process--or face personal liability. 5 See,\ne._:g:., Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1982-83 (1994)\n(requirement to protect from other inmates); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97,\n97 S.Ct. 285, 290 (1976) (requirement to provide necessary medical care);\n5 The cases that follow are not cited for the proposition that inmates\nenjoy frequent success in civil rights lawsuits. Rather, the cases stand for the\nD\nproposition that inmates--pretrial detainees and convicts alike--have a\npanoply of actionable civil rights, which jailers are obligated to understand\nand respect, and which can breed substantial and costly litigation--even if\nultimately meritless or barred by immunity.\n15\n\nCagle v. S 334 F.3d 980 (11 th Cir. 2003) (jail suicide claim); Bass\nv. Perrin, 170 F.3d 1312, 1318 (11 thCir. 1999) (due process claim); Wilson\nv. Blankenship,163 F.3d 1284 (1lth Cir. 1998) (claims based on failure to\nprovide access to law library, inadequate exercise space and administrative\nisolation); Mitchell v. Farcass, 112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11 th Cir. 1997) (claim\nbased on alleged retaliation for exercise of First Amendment rights); Harem\nv. DeKalb County, 774 F.2d 1567 (11 th Cir.1985) (jail conditions claim);\nMiller v. Carson, 563 F.2d 741 (5thCir. 1977) (jail conditions class action);\nHunt v. Reynolds, 974 F.2d 734 (6th Cir. 1992) (claim of harm due to\nexposure to secondhand tobacco smoke).\nJail officials must maintain order while keeping themselves and\ninmates from bodily harm, from inmates who frequently have little or\nnothing to lose by assaulting them or otherwise creating chaos. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Bradford, 237 F.3d 1306 (11 th Cir. 2001) (prosecution of\ninmate after she jabbed one officer with mop handle and threw cup of urine\non another; officer was doused with urine just after inmate requested AIDS\n(Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and herpes test); White v.\nLemacks, 183 F.3d 1253, 1254 (1 I th Cir. 1999) (female jail nurses savagely\nbeaten by pretrial detainee; nurses then sued sheriff and deputy); Hardin v.\nStynchcomb, 691 F.2d 1364, 1375 (11 th Cir. 1982) (Clark, J., dissenting)\nt\n16\n\n(\"Deputies in the male division of the jail are subjected to daily verbal and,\nin some instances, physical abuse by inmates. Inmates have been known to\nthrow urine on the deputies as they pass the cells, and physically confront\nand attack deputies on occasion.\").\nJailers must deal with all these concerns in a stressful environment, all\ntoo frequently with limited or inadequate funding and staff. This Court\nshould be mindful of all these factors when determining what limits to place\non their ability to protect their safety, the safety of general population\ninmates and the safety of other jail personnel who must deal with such\ninmates.\nThis Court's 2001 panel ruling requiring \"reasonable suspicion\" for a\nstrip search, apparently even when the detainee is placed in a general jail\npopulation, 6 opened a new front of liability for jail officers in the Eleventh\nCircuit and unreasonably restricted jailers' ability to protect the safety and\nsecurity of a detention facility. As the Supreme Court recognized in Bell v.\nWolfish, a visual strip search is an effective tool for ensuring jail safety,\nsecurity and order, and deterring smuggling of contraband into general jail\npopulations. Jailers' ability to conduct such searches should not be dissolved\nD in the opaque pool of\"reasonable suspicion.\"\nD\n6 Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11 th Cir. 2001).\n17\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that the threat of litigation for\nalleged failure to comply with an uncertain standard creates a disincentive to\nadequate law enforcement and a consequent threat to officer safety, even\nwhere qualified immunity may ultimately protect the officer from liability.\nThe doctrine of qualified immunity is not the panacea the dissent\nbelieves it to be. See post, at 1564-1565. As the dissent itself\nrightly acknowledges, even where personal liability does not\nultimately materialize, the mere \"specter of liability\" may inhibit\npublic officials in the discharge of their duties, ibid. for even those\nofficers with airtight qualified immunity defenses are forced to\nincur \"the expenses of litigation\" and to endure the \"diversion of\n[their] official energy from pressing public issues,\" Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 814, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396\n(1982). Further, and somewhat perversely, the disincentive to\narrest produced by [the plaintiff's] opaque standard would be most\npronounced in the very situations in which police officers can least\nafford to hesitate: when acting \"on the spur (and in the heat) of the\nmoment,\" supra, at 1553. We could not seriously expect that when\nevents were unfolding fast, an officer would be able to tell with\nmuch confidence whether a suspect's conduct qualified, or even\n\"reasonably\" qualified, under one of the exceptions to [the\nplaintiff's] general no-arrests rule.\nAtwater v. City of Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 351 n. 22, 121 S.Ct. 1536,\n1556 n. 22 (2001) (rejecting litigant's proposed tests for when warrantless\narrests for minor offenses should or should not be permissible).\nSimilar to the arrest scenario considered in Atwater, jail officials are\nfrequently required to make hurried security decisions with little initial\nD\ninformation regarding the persons with whom they must deal. Jailers most\nW\n18\n\na\nD\nD\nfrequently receive pretrial detainees directly from the streets and they do not\nknow the detainees or their history. Most often the jail officers do not\nparticipate in the arrest, and do not know the circumstances under which the\narrest was made.\nQ Except for the three factual scenarios where strip searches were\nupheld by this Court, 7there is no guidance as to what '_reasonable suspicion\"\nt\nfor a strip search means in any given circumstance, s And, given the legal\no\nD\nconsequences, it is unlikely that informed officers will be willing to risk\nliability to find out. It is easier and less expensive to discontinue strip\nsearches than to defend lawsuits. This litigation threat ultimately raises the\nD\ndanger and contraband levels in general jail populations.\nD\nEven where qualified immunity protects individual officers, the\nagency or supervisor for whom the officer works can still be liable. See\n._enerally Monell v. New York City Department of Social Services, 436 U.S.\n658, 98 S.Ct. 2018 (1978) (entity liability); Gold v. City of Miami, 151 F.3d\n1346 (11 thCir. 1998) (entity liability for failure to train); Belcher v. City of\n7 Cuesta v. School Bd. of Miami-Dade County, Fla., 285 F.3d 962 (ll lh\nCir. 2002); Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678 (11 'h Cir. Dec. 28, 2000);\nJustice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11 thCir. 1992).\n19\n\nFoley, Ala., 30 F.3d 1390 (11 thCir. 1994) (supervisor personal liability). In\nsum, the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard provides policymakers with a\nstrong disincentive to permit any detainee to be strip searched--no matter\nhow reasonable the circumstances.\nSimilar uncertainty applies to pretrial detainees and the general public.\n\"When a person cannot know how a court will apply a settled principle to a\nrecurring fact'aal situation, that person cannot know the scope of his\nconstitutional protection, nor can a policeman \"know the scope of his\nauthority.'\" New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 459-60, 101 S.Ct. 2860,\n2864 (1981).\nAccordingly, the public, pretrial detainees and jail officials will\nbenefit from a rule that is clear and easily applied, and which accounts for\nthe substantial pressures, dangers and competing interests to which jail\nofficials and general population inmates are exposed. Allowing a visual strip\nsearch of any detainee to be housed in a general population area will provide\nsuch a clear rule, while protecting all concerned.\nIn fact, Bell v. Wolfish and this Court's decision in Justice v. City of\n8 Lest this Court be led to believe that the familiar \"reasonable\nsuspicion\" language is in any sense self-defining, the volumes written after\n20 plus years of litigation over the meaning of that phrase--in federal and\nstate courts--tell a different story.\nD\n20\n\nO\nPeachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11 thCir. 1992), provide the ground for\nsuch a simple rule for general population pretrial detainees. This Court\nshould permit nonintrusive, visual strip searches of pretrial detainees who\nare introduced into a general jail population--regardless of reasonable\nsuspicion--where the search is conducted by a jailer(s) of the same sex as\nthe detainee, using a room where only the participants are present to conduct\nthe search.\nImportantly, the Supreme Court ended its opinion in Bell with a\npertinent admonition:\nIT]he inquiry of federal courts into prison management must be\nlimited to the issue of whether a particular system violates any\nprohibition of the Constitution or, in the case of a federal prison, a\nstatute. The wide range of \"judgment calls\" that meet\nconstitutional and statutory requirements are confided to officials\noutside of the Judicial Branch of Government.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 562. Amici respectfully urge the Court to follow Bell.\nCONCLUSION\nFor ihe within and foregoing reasons, this Court should permit\narrestees who are to be detained in the general jail population to be strip\nsearched in the manner described in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct.\nI\n1861 (1979) and Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (1 lth\nI Cir. 1992), regardless whether the search is supported by reasonable\nsuspicion that such a search will reveal weapons or contraband.\n21\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nTERRY E.

Officer Stephens Had Discretionary_ Authority_ to Conduct a Strip Search\nof the Appellees.\nAppellees first argue that Stephens did not have discretionary authorit3, to\nconduct a strip search of the Appellees. They rely on a misleadingly selective citation\nof Chief Lummus' testimony.\nThe District Court correctly found \"though Plaintiffs contend otherwise,\nStephens acted within his discretionary authority in perforating a strip search on\nPlaintiffs as the Zebulon Police Department policy manual allows officers to conduct\nstrip searches in certain situations.\" (R.53-14 through 15). That policy is found in the\nCity of Zebulon police manual attached to Defendants' Joint Exhibits, and states \"a\nstrip search may be conducted if it is reasonable in light of the circumstances.\" (R.42-\nJDE-4-82).\nAppellees contend that Lummus had verbally overridden this policy. However,\ncontrary to Appellees' assertions, Lummus testified as follows:\nQ Okay, and I want to be clear about this in that the verbal warning\nyou gave Denis [Stephens] as a result of the strip search on the side\nof the road, did I understand you correctly when you said earlier\nthat you told Denis he was not to do any more strip searches under\nany circumstances?\nA Right, on the road.\n\nQ On the road?\nA R_ig_b!.\nQ What about strip searches at the jail?\nA Well, he shouldn't have to do any in the jail because the jailers\ntake over fi-om there.\nQ Okay. So would your verbal warning of Denis have included\nDenis, don't do any strip searches on the road and\nstrip searches at the jail too?\nA I didn't say anything about the jail because usualls_ when a person\nis arrested and patted down on the road mad then brought in,\nthey're automatically turned over to the jail.\nQ So as the chief of police had you known that one of your officers\nhad conducted strip searches at the jail would that have been a\nviolation of your policy.'?\nA It'd have been a violation of what I said.\nQ Do you believe it would've been a violation of your written policy?\nA Yes.\n(R.45 (Lurmnus Depo.) pp. 40-41 (emphasis supplied)).\nEarlier in his deposition, Appellees' counsel asked Chief Lummus:\nQ And as a result of that conversation you had with Denis before\nJanuary 22, 1999 what did you instruct Denis to do?\n\nA\nI told him not to be doing any strip searching at all.\nQ Ever.\nA Period, not on the road.\n(R.45 (Lurmnus Depo.) pp. 38-39 (emphasis supplied)).\nEach time Chief Lmmnus was questioned about his directions to Officer\nStephens he specified that they pertained to strip searches \"on the road.\" Chief\nLununus' belief that strip searches at the jail, but before the prisoners were mined over\nto the jailers, violates the policy may be his current opinion, but it does not eliminate\nOfficer Stephens' discretionary authority granted by the policy. Therefore, the District\nCourt's conclusion that Officer Stephens did have discretionary authority in this matter\nis correct.\nOfficer Stephens did not understand Chief Lummus' directive to be a blanket\nprohibition on all strip searches. (R.45 (Stephens Depo.) pp. 101, 114). ChiefLununus\nnever specifically directed him not to conduct reasonable strip searches in the privacy\nof a room at the jail. It never occurred to Chief Lummus that the officers might do that.\nThat it did not occur to ChiefLummus, and he now believes it violates policy, is a far\ncry fxom it being a violation of his verbal orders to Officer Stephens. More importantly,\nit does not remove Officer Stephens' discretionary authority to conduct reasonable strip\nsearches.\n\nB. Officer Stephens Has Qualified Immunity for His Alleged Actions at the\nPike County_ Jail.\nAs argued in the original brief, Officer Stephens did not violate Appellees'\nconstitutional rights. He had reasonable suspicion for the strip searches and conducted\nthem in an objectively reasonable manner.\n1. Officer Stephens had reasonable suspicion to believe, or, in the\nalternative, arguable reasonable suspicion to believe, that the\nAppellees were concealing drugs on their persons.\nAppellees only argue that the District Court correctly concluded that Officer\nStephens' suspicions were based on nothing more than a rental car and a hunch. They\ninvite this Court to review the tape. The facts and the law supporting Officer Stephens\"\nreasonable suspicion of the Appellees is found on pages 12 - 16 of his original brief.\nAppellees fail to address any of the specific objective facts or distinguish any of the\ncases cited there.\nFurthermore, and more importantly, Appellees fail to address the issue that the\narguable reasonable suspicion analysis is an objective one. \"In determining whether\narguable probable cause exists, '[w]e apply an objective standard, asking \"whether the\nofficer's actions are objectively reasonable ... regardless of the officer's underlying\nintent or motivation.'\"\" Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188, 1195 (1 lth Cir. 2002) (citing\nVaughan v. Cox, 264 F.3d 1027, 1036 (11 th Cir.2001 )(quoting Montoute v. Cart, 114\nF.3d 181,184.(1 lth Cir.1997)), re'aff'd after remand 316 F.3d 1210 (11 thCir., Jan.\n23, 2003)). This Court has held, in the context of a probable cause to arrest case, that\n\nif reasonable people can disagree based on previous law about the existence of\nprobable cause, that qualified immunity attaches to the officer's actions. Marsh v.\nButler County, Alabmna, 268 F.3d 1014, 1031 n.8 (llth Cir. 2001).\nClearly, based upon the cases cited in Appellant's original brief, Officer\nStephens had reasonable suspicion sufficient to support his actions. As noted in\nfootnote nine of the initial brief, the Second Circuit in United States v. Asbury, 586\nF.2d 973, 976-77 (2\"dCir. 1978), set forth 12 factors that may establish reasonable\nsuspicion. Eight of those factors arguably apply in this case. Appellees simply fail to\naddress this issue at all. Officer Stephens' testimony regarding his reasonable suspicion\nis as follows:\nQ Now you did not find any bulges, you did not fred any suspicious\nobjects, you did not find anything suspicious as a result of your pat\ndown search of either of these individuals at the scene of the arrest,\ncorrect?\nA I did not check his crotch area at the scene of the arrest.\nQ All right. What reason did you have to believe after conducting\nyour pat down search of either of these suspects that they may be\nconcealing contraband within their clothes?\nA As I said earlier before, sir; the demeanor of which they was\nacting-\nQ Their nervousness?\nA And the stories they was coming from.\n\nQ And their story?\nA Coming from Atlanta and going to Statesboro on 85 don't - it\nwon't go there.\nQ So because they were nervous and because they told you the\ndirection that they had been traveling to get to Concord, it is your\ntestimony that you formed a reasonable suspicion to believe that\none or both of them were concealing illegal drags inside their\nclothing?\nA Also Mr. Evans' conduct, the way he was acting, his demeanor in\nwhich he was acting.\nQ Those are tile only two reasons that you formed your reasonable\nsuspicion, correct?\nA That's correct.\nQ So would it be fair to say that based on those two reasons you\nclaim to have suspected before you got to the Pike County Jail that\none or both of these individuals may have illegal drugs concealed\nunderneath their clothing, correct?\nA That's correct.\n(R.45 (Stephens Depo.) pp. 88-89). Earlier in his deposition, Officer Stephens had\ndetailed why the Appellees' nervousness and story made him suspicious. (R.45\n(Stephens Depo.) pp. 70-71; R.42-JDE-5, 20:03 through 20:14).\nIf the facts do not establish reasonable suspicion as a matter of law, Officer\n6\n\nStephensclearly had arguable reasonablesuspicion. As noted in the prev!ous brief, if\nno caseclearly establishes that the factors within the reasonable officer's \"knowledge\nwould not provide reasonable suspicion, then the Court should conclude that he had\narguable reasonable suspicion. See Marsh, su__p__A. ppellees fail to point to any such\ncase, and qualified immunity should attach to the search.\n2. Officer Stephens' Strip Search of the Plaintiffs Did Not Violate\nClearly Established Law.\nThe Appellees argue that Officer Stephens' strip search of the Appellees was\nabusive, and, therefore, Officer Stephens is not entitled to qualified immunity. The\nAppellees, however, fail to address the critical issue of the qualified i_mnunity analysis:\nwhether the clearly established law gave a reasonable officer in Stephens' position fair\nwarning that his objective actions violated the constitutional rights of the Appellees.\nThis is an objective analysis. Appellees want to focus on Officer Stephens' alleged\nwords and the alleged force used. Officer Stephens' alleged subjective intent, however,\nis irrelevant to the qualified immunity analysis.\nThe alleged words are completely irrelevant to the qualified immtmity analysis\nfor the asserted constitutional violation, that being the alleged body cavity search while\nusing a baton to spread Appellees' cheeks and lift their genitals. As noted in the\nprevious brief, racial slurs and threats of prison rape do not amount to constitutional\nviolations. See Edwards v. Gilbert, 867 F.2d 1271, 1273 n.1 (llth Cir. 1989);\nMcFadden v. Lucas., 713 F.2d 143, 145-46 (5th Cir. 1983); Hopson v. Frederickson,\n961 F.2d 1374, 1378 (8th Cir. 1992); Oltarzewski v. Ruggiero, 830 F.2d 136 (9th Cir.\n\n1987); Collins v. Ctmdy, 603 F.2d 825, 827 (10th Cir. 1979); see also Hudson v.\nMcMillan, 503 U.S. 1, __, 112 S. Ct. 995 1004, 117 L. Ed.2d 156 (1992) (Blackmun,\nJ., concurring opinion) (de minimus infliction of psychological pain is not actionable\nunder the Eighth Amendment). Appellees fail to point to any authority to the contrary.\nWith regard to the force, as Appellees' factual recitations establish, the\nAppellees were being noncompliant. In this context Officer Stephens was entitled to\nuse force and there is no clearly established law that would give a reasonable officer\nfair warning that the objective force used by Officer Stephens violated clearly\nestablished law.\na. This Is Not an \"Obvious Clarity\" Case.\nAppellees point to this Court's recent decision in Vinyard v. Wilson, 311 F.3d\n1340 (11 th Cir. 2002), and argue that the force used by Officer Stephens was\nunconstitutional and that the Fourth Aanendment applies with obvious clarity to\nStephens' actions. The facts of Vin a,y__ddare not in any way similar to the facts of this\ncase. In that case, the female arrested was handcuffed in the back of a patrol car and\nthen was dragged out by her hair and pepper sprayed simply because she was verbally\nabusing the officer. In this case, the Appellees were not handcuffed, Officer Stephens\nwas attempting to perform a strip search for which he had reasonable suspicion, and,\naccording to the Appellees, they were clearly noncompliant.\nThe obvious clarity analysis still requires that the case relied upon provide some\nguidance on the issue at hand. As the Court noted in a recently decided case, \"Whether\nDeputy Cox had arguable probable cause, whether deadly force was necessaD, to\n\nprevent Vaughan's escape, and whether a warning was feasible in the instant caseare\nall questions that the general rule [of Tennesseev. Garner] does not clearly answer.\"\nVaughan v. Cox, 316 F.3d 1210, 1213 (1 lth Cir. 2003). Likewise, the general rule of\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed.2d 447 (1979), and even\nJustice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11 'h Cir. 1992), do not answer the\nquestion of permissible actions with a noncompliant searchee.\nb. This Is Not a Case in Which Broad Statements Provide Fair\nWarning.\nAppellees next argue that the broad statements in Bell v. Wolfish give fair\nwarning to the reasonable officer. Appellees' argument misses the point. The only two\ncases decided at the time of Officer Stephens' strip search of the Appellees (.Bell and\nJustice.) had approved the strip searches at issue. Neither case addresses the issue of\nwhat an officer may or may not lawfully do with a noncompliant arrestee. The general\nlegal principles of Bell and Justice do not give clear and fair warning m this case. The\nlegal principle of Bell is that a reasonable strip search to protect the safety and integrity\nof a prison is lawful if based on reasonable suspicion. The general legal principle of\nJustice is that the limited search of that female juvenile was reasonable under the\ncircumstances. The general legal principles of these cases address what is permitted,\nnot what actions are unlawful. Appellees seek to detach the qualified immunity analysis\nfrom any review of the cases, which eviscerates the central purpose of the clearly\nestablished law analysis of qualified immunity.\nThis Court's recent decision in .Vaughan v. Cox, 316 F.3d 1210 (11 'hCir. 2003)\n9\n\nafter aremandby the United StatesSupremeCourt for reconsideration in !ight of Hoo_p_e\nv. Pelzev, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 153 L. Ed.2d 666 (2002), is instructive. Writing over the\nvigorous dissent of Ninth Circuit Judge Noonan, Judges Cames and Cox properly\napplied the qualified immunity rule of this Circuit. In that case, notwithstanding that\nthere existed possible jury questions regarding the officers' use of deadly force, the\nCourt held that the officers had qualified immunity for their actions. The Court noted\nthat the rule of Tennessee v. Garner regarding the use of deadly force standing alone\ndid not apply with obvious clarity so as to give the officers fair warning that the alleged\nconduct was unconstitutional. The Court went on to review the cases applying Garner\nin similar factual scenarios and concluded that the law was not clearly established.\nLikewise in this case, the nile of Bell, holding that strip searches based on\nreasonable suspicion may be conducted on compliant prisoners to protect the integrity\nof the prison system, simply does not inform a reasonable officer in Stephens'\ncircumstances that what he was doing would violate the law.\nc. The Specific Previously Decided Cases Do Not Give Fair\nWarning.\nFinally, Appellees argue that \"fact specific precedent cases give fair and clear\nwarning.\" Such an argument, however, is clearly without merit. In this section,\nAppellees cite force cases and not strip search cases. These do not clearly establish the\nlaw with regard to the strip search conducted by Officer Stephens. Fortunately,\nAppellees provide parentheticals summarizing the facts of the cases upon which they\nrely. All the cases involve arrestees who were handcuffed and not resisting. Under\n10\n\nAppellees' alleged facts, this case does not present the same circumstance. These\nAppellees were not handcuffed and were admittedly noncompliant.\nd. Summary.\nClearly, if the Court looks for any factual specific cases for purposes of this\nqualified immunity analysis, there are none and Officer Stephens is entitled to qualified\nimmunity. If this Court reviews Bell and Justice to determine if the general legal\nprinciples enunciated therein apply with obvious clarity to these facts, Officer Stephens\nis entitled to qualified immunity. For a case to apply with obvious clarity, it must have\nat least have held that the activities alleged therein were unlawful. In other words, there\nmust have been some case decided at the time of the instant search that held the search\nto be tmlawful and thereby provide some parameters that would apply with \"obvious\nclarity\" to facts faced by Officer Stephens. There is no such case. Finally, clearly this\ntype of case cannot be decided based on the mere words of the Fourth Amendment.\nEspecially in light of the cases decided at the time that upheld the searches at issue,\nOfficer Stephens is entitled to qualified immunity.\nII. CONCLUSION\nOfficer Stephens has qualified innntmity because his actions were\nconstitutionally reasonable and no case clearly established on January 22, 1999 that a\nstrip search in which he used a baton to separate the noncompliant detainees' buttocks\nand lift the non-complaint detainees' genitals violated the detainees' rights. Therefore,\nOfficer Stephens would be entitled to qualified immunity from Appellees' claims\narising out of the strip search.\n11\n\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this _ day of February, 2003.\nCAROTHERS & MITCHELL, LLC\nRIC_ A.

Amici, American Civil Liberties Union of Florida,\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, Inc., and American Civil Liberties\nUnion of Alabama, Inc., are three of the dozens of statewide ACLU affiliates\ndedicated to protecting liberty and equality in their respective states. Amici are\nfrequently involved in litigation against government officials in the Eleventh\nCircuit, and filed a brief with the Supreme Court inHope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730\n(2002). The qualified immunity standard applied by the Eleventh Circuit directly\naffects Amici's programs.\nAmici are authorized to file this Brief by Fed. R. App. Pro. 29(a). The\nparties consent to and do not oppose the filing of this Brief.\nSTATEMENT OF ISSUE\nWhether the District Court properly denied Summary Judgment based on\nqualified immunity to a police officer who illegally and abusively strip-searched\ntwo pre-trial detainees.'?\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Supreme Court's recent decision in Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730 (2002),\nsignificantly changes the Eleventh Circuit's qualified immunity analysis. No longer\nneed a previously decided, \"materially similar\" case exist. Instead, in order to\ndefeat qualified immunity, it is enough if the government official is on \"fair notice\"\nthat his conduct is wrong.\nThe Supreme Court's more recent decision in Groh v. Ramirez. 124 S. Ct.\n1284 (2004), further demonstrates how far the Eleventh Circuit has strayed. Groh\nbuilds on Hope and establishes that governmental officials bear the burden of\njustifying an excuse from liability for unconstitutional conduct. Materially similar\ncases need not exist. Binding precedent is not necessary. Factual conclusions,\nmoreover, should not be drawn on interlocutory appeal. In sum, the time has come\nfor this Court to reexamine its qualified imrnunity jurisprudence.\nThe-District Court properly concluded that the law surrounding strip-searches\nwas clear at the time of the Appellant's wrong. It thus propffly concluded that\nAppellees presented sufficient evidence to overcome Appellant's motion for\nsummary judgment based on qualified immunity. The allegations and testimony,\ntaken as true, present genuine issues of material fact surrounding Appellant's use of\nforce against Appellees and preclude summary judgment.\n\nARGUMENT\n1. The Supreme Court's Decision in Hope v. Pelzer Replaces this\nCourt's \"Materially Similar\" Approach With a Fair Warning\nStandard.\nIn its June 2002 decision in Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730 (2002), the\nSupreme Court handed an important victory to civil rights plaintiffs in America,\nand particularly in the Eleventh Circuit. The Hope Court held that a plaintiffneed\nnot point to a prior court ruling involving sirrilar facts to overcome qualified\nimmunity. Rather, government officers can be held liable as long as they had \"fair\nwarning\" that their conduct was illegal or impermissible. Noted constitutional\nauthorities, like Erwin Chemerinsky, have observed that the Supreme Court's\nopinion inHope marked an important change in the law of qualified immunity, one\nthat \"promises to make it much easier for civil rights plaintiffs to obtain justice.\"\nErwin Chemerinsky, A Plaintiff Friendly Standard for O'vil Rights Cases, Trial\n(September 2002). See also Erwin Chemerinsky, Supreme Court Review, 51 U.\nKansas L. Rev. 269, 289 (2003) (\"I think the case [Hope] is crucial in saying there\ndoesn't have to be a case on point.\").\nHope's resolution in the Eleventh Circuit and subsequent reversal by the\nSupreme Court bear witness to Professor Chemerinsky's praise. Hope, an inmate\nassigned to a chain gang at the Limestone Correctional Facility in Alabama in 1995,\n\nwas twice handcuffed to a \"hitching post\" aspunishment for disruptive behavior.\nHope v. Pelzer, 240 F.3d 975,977 (11thCir. 2001). \"Hope was cuffed ... with his\narms at approximately head level, in the hot sun for seven hours with no shirt, metal\ncuffs, only one or two water breaks, and no bathroom breaks. At one time, prison\nguards brought a cooler of water near him, let the prison dogs drink fromthe water,\nand then kicked the cooler over at Hope's feet.\" Id. at 978.\nHope sued his tormentors under the Eighth Amendment, only to have his\ncase dismissed based on qualified immunity. Id. at 977. On appeal, the Eleventh\nCircuit concluded that while \"cuffing an inmate to a hitching post for a period of\ntime extending past that required to address an immediate danger or threat is a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment,\" id. at 980, \"a factfinder [could] conclude that\na prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was\nobvious,\" id. at 978, and that the hitching post's illegality \"could be inferred from\n[prior] opinions,\" id. at 981, the defendants were still entitled to qualified immunity.\n\"Despite the unconstitutionality of the prison practice and, therefore, the guards'\nactions, there was no clear, bright-line test established in 1995 that would survive\nour circuit's qualified immunity analysis.\" /d. The Court explained that \"it is\nimportant to analyze the facts in ... [prior] cases, and detemaine if they are\n'materially similar' to the facts in the case in front of us.\"/d. \"[A]nalogous\" facts,\n\nthe Court concluded, are not enough. /d. Instead, the facts must be '\"materially\nsimilar' to Hope's situation.\" M.\nIn reversing, the Supreme Court disavowed the Eleventh Circuit's analysis:\n\"the Court of Appeals required that the facts of previous cases be 'materially similar\nto Hope's situation'. This rigid gloss on the qualified immunity standard ... is not\nconsistent with our cases.\" See Hope, 536 U.S. at 739 & n.9. It continued:\nofficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even\nin novel factual circumstances .... Although earlier cases involving\n\"fundamentally similar\" facts can provide especially strong support for a\nconclusion that the law is clearly established, they are not necessary to such a\nfinding. The same is true of cases with \"materially similar\" facts .... [T]he\nsalient question that the Court of Appeals ought to have asked is whether the\nstate of the law in 1995 gave respondents fair warning that their alleged\ntreatment of Hope was unconstitutional.\nId. at 741.\nThe Supreme Court cited Lassiter v. Alabama A &M, 3 F.3d 1482 (11th Cir.\n1993), overruled in part, 28 F.3d 1146 (1994) (_ banc), as an additional, draconian\nexample. The plaintiff there, Lassiter, was discharged by Alabama A & M without\nbeing given a proper hearing. He sued the University and several officials in their\nindividual capacities under the federal Due Process Clause, which generally\nrequires prior hearings for public-sector employees with \"legitimate claims of\nentitlement\" to continued employment. See Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S.\n564, 577-78 (1972). Lassiter argued that a written contract and personnel manual\n5\n\nI\nI\ncreated his claim to \"entitlement,\" which obligated the University to hold a hearing.\nI\nThe District Court dismissed Lassiter's claims against the officials based on\ni\nqualified immunity. This Court initially reversed, concluding \"the law was clear\nthat an employee with a contractual expectation of continued employment had a\nI\nproperty interest in that employment.\" 3 F.3d at 1486 (citing Roth, 408 U.S. at 577-\ni 78). \"Because the law was clearly established,\" the panel explained, \"the\nI\n[defendants'] ... assertion that the contract is unclear is relevant only to Lassiter's\nI\nability to prove his claim. An uncertainty in the facts does not give rise to qualified\nimmunity.\" 3 F.3d at 1486.\nl\nThe en banc Court, however, overturned the panel's decision. Even though it\nl\nfound that \"[n]o new rules need to be announced to decide this case,\" the Court still\nI\nconcluded that the defendants were entitled to immunity. 28 F.3d at 1149. \"For the\nI\nlaw to be clearly established ..., the law must have earlier been developed in such a\nI concrete and factually defined context to make it obvious to all reasonable\ngovernment actors, in the defendant's place, that 'what he is doing' violates federal\nI\nlaw.\" Id. \"Because it was not established as a matter of law in Alabama that either\ni\nthe contract's words or the manual's words or both would support aproperty right\nI\nfor Lassiter, the law was also not clearly established that Lassiter was, when\nI defendants acted, due a hearing.\" Id. at 1151.\nI\n\nIf there remained any question about the proper analysis following Hope, it\nwas laid to rest by Groh v. Ramirez, 124 S. Ct. 1284 (2004). In Groh, an ATF\nagent (Groh) presented a detailed warrant application and affidavit to a Magistrate\ndescribing a local residence to be searched and guns to be seized. Unfortunately,\nthe actual warrant signed by the Magistrate, and executed by Groh, failed to\ndescribe the items to be seized. The Supreme Court ruled not only that Groh's\nsearch violated the Fourth Amendment, but that he was not entitled to qualified\nimmunity either. The rule against warrantless searches of homes, the Court\nexplained, was clearly established over two decades ago in Payton v. New York, 445\nU.S. 573 (1980). In the absence of precedent suggesting that reliance on a plainly\ndefective warrant was excused or immunized, the Court concluded, Groh should\nhave known that his conduct was unlawful. Importantly, the Court in Groh placed\nthe burden on the defendant (Groh) to show specific cases that supported immunity:\n\"Because not a word in any of our cases would suggest to a reasonable officer that\nthis case fits within any exception to that fundamental tenet [expressed in Payton],\n[Groh] is asking us, in effect, to craft a new exception. Absent any support for such\nan exception in our cases, he cannot reasonably have relied on an expectation that\nwe would do so.\" 124 S. Ct. at 1294. Groh thus makes doubly clear that plaintiffs\nneed not point to rmterially similar cases to defeat immunity. Given a clear general\n\nrule, the burden is on the governmental defendant to point out specific cases\njustifying immunity.\nThe Eleventh Circuit's error in Hope (and before that, Lassiter) was twofold:\nfirst, its myopic focus on factual identity; second, its placing the burden on\nplaintiffs to uncover these factually identical cases. As made clear by the Supreme\nCourt in Hope, factual similarity is not the touchstone of qualified immunity. The\n\"salient question,\" instead, is \"fair warning.\" Whether an official had fair warning\nis judged under the same standard applied to criminal defendants under the Due\nProcess Clause. See Barbara E. Armacost, Qualified Immunity: Ignorance Excused,\n51 Vand. L. Rev. 583 (1998). As stated inHope, 536 U.S. at 740 n. 10, \"the\nqualified immunity test is simply the adaptation of the fair warning standard to give\nofficials ... the same protection from civil liability ... that individuals have\ntraditionally possessed in the face of vague criminal statutes.\" And as demonstrated\nby Groh, the burden of proving reasonable reliance is on the defense. It is not the\nplaintiff's burden to disprove reasonable reliance. There is no presumption in\nfavor of qualified immunity.\nThis analysis is not overly formalistic or unduly burdensome. Like Due\nProcess's vagueness doctrine, qualified immunity is designed to protect wrongdoers\nwho could not have foreseen the unlawfulness of their conduct. Neither doctrine\n\npresumes protection and neither is intended to generally shield aberrant behavior.\nHow many criminals, after all, successfully invoke vagueness? It can hardly besaid\nthat most criminal defendants are immune because they lack fair warning.\nArmacost, supra, at 593. Even assuming that constitutional prohibitions, like the\nban on racial discrimination, sexual harassment and police brutality, are ten (or\neven one-hundred) times less clear than criminal laws, _it is hard to understand why\ngovernment officials so regularly escape liability in the Eleventh Circuit.\nBefore Hope, most government officials - almost all - were awarded\nqualified immunity by the Eleventh Circuit. Using its \"materially similar\" analysis,\nsee, e.g., Rowe v. Fort Lauderdale, 279 F.3d 1271 (1 lth Cir. 2002), the Eleventh\nCircuit carefully sifted through the peculiar facts of one case in order to distinguish\nit from another. Even minor discrepancies justified distinctions, which in turn\njustified an award of immunity. See, e.g,, Marsh v. Butler County, 268 F.3d 1014,\ntSee Mark R. Brown, The Failure of Fault Under § 1983: Municipal\nLiability for State Law Enforcement, 84 Comell L. Rev. 1503, 1524-25 (1999)\n(\"Constitutional law is no more indeterminate than any other legal field. It is\nsufficiently puzzling to make it interesting and is sometimes frustrating because of\nthe patent and latent politics that infect opinions. Yet both the legal logic and\npolitics of constitutional decision making are fairly predictable .... Legal\nindeterminacy is unfortunate, but is an insoluble constant that plagues the American\nlegal system. Excusing governmental violations may be wise policy for some other\nreason, but it does not flow from any unique concern over intractable constitutional\ndecision making.\").\n\n1032 (1Ith Cir. 2001) (en banc) (observing that \"minor variations in sorm facts ...\nmight bevery important\"). Because § 1983 plaintiffs areseldom able to locate\nreported decisions with identical, or even \"materially similar,\" facts, qualified\nimmunity in the Eleventh Circuit by 2002 became \"almost-absolute immunity.\"\nThe Eleventh Circuit's analysis generateddozens of questionable holdings-\nmany of which would havecome out differently under the Supreme Court's fair\nwarning standard. Lewis v. McDade, 250 F.3d 1320, 1321 (11 thCir. 2001), which\nawarded qualified immunity to a prosecutor who \"ran a DA's office rife with\ngender-discrimination,\" is one example. Despite horrendous facts, see id. at 1321\n(Barkett, J., dissenting), the Court concluded that \"qualified immunity protects [the\ndefendant] from civil liability because there [was] no pre-existing case which would\nhave put him on notice ....\" Id. z\nPrior to Hope, conduct that would not be immunized in any other Circuit was\noften protected in the Eleventh. A public employee claiming workplace retaliation\nbased on protected speech, to use one example, was generally barred from\nrecovering damages. See Hansen v. Soldenwagner, 19 F. 3d 573, 576 (11 th Cir.\n2Less egregious facts have caused most other circuits to deny qualified\nimmunity in the context of sexual harassment. See, e.g., Morris v. Oldham County\nFiscal Court, 201 F.3d 784, 800 n.2 (6th Cir. 2000);Johnson v. Martin, 195 F.3d\n1208, 1220 (10th Cir. 1999); Bator v. Hawaii, 39 F.3d 1021, 1029 (9th Or. 1994);\nCrawfordv. Davis, 109 F.3d 1281, 1284(8th Cir. 1997).\n10\n\nI\ni 1994). 3 The same proved true for protestors (and lawyers) who used curse words in\nI\npublic. See, e.g., Gold v. City of Miami, 121 F.3d 1442, 1444 (1 lth Cir. 1997)\nI (awarding qualified immunity to officer who arrested attorney for stating that\n\"police don't do shit\"). 4\nI\nSpace constraints prevent Amici from detailing an exhaustive list of\nI\nquestionable precedents prior to Hope. Suffice it to say that the Eleventh Circuit,\nI\npre-Hope, found qualified immunity in literally every constitutional context\nI imaginable. In addition to those cases discussed above, the Eleventh Circuit upheld\nqualified immunity defenses m racial discrimination cases, s those involving free\nI\nI\n3Contrast Myers v. Hasara, 226 F.3d 821 (7th Cir. 2000) (refusing to award\nqualified immunity in case involving retaliation based on speech). Amici recognize\nI\nthat on occasion the Eleventh Circuit denied immunity. See, e.g., Cooper v. Smith,\n89 F.3d 761 (11 th Cir. 1996) (refusing qualified immunity in Pickering context).\nThis result, however, proved the exception in the Eleventh Circuit.\nI\n4Every other Circuit to consider this issue has found that arrests based on\nI profanity or disagreeable speech violate clearly established First Amendment\nstandards. See, e.g., Spiller v. City of Texas City, Police Dep't, 130 F.3d 162 (5th\nCir. 1997); Knox v. Southwest Airlines, 124 F.3d 1103 (9th Cir. 1997); MacKinney\nv.

Daly, Statutory Civil Rights, 53 Mercer L.\nI Rev. 1499, 1556 (2002).\nGiven the Eleventh Circuit's history and the Supreme Court's explicit\nI\nlanguage rejecting such a rigid approach, it is not difficult to understand how Hope\nI\nchanged things. Unfortunately, while the Eleventh Circuit has sometimes\nI\nrecognized Hope's impact, Is it has more often ignored it. Following Hope, the\nI\nSupreme Court vacated and remanded three Eleventh Circuit opinions for\nreconsideration. In two of the three, the Court on remand, while offering lip-\nI\nservice to Hope, awarded the defendants qualified immunity. In Willingham v.\nI\nLoughnan, 261 F.3d 1178 (11 th Cir. 2001), vacated, 536 U.S. 730 (2002), affirmed\nI\non remand, 321 F.3d 1299, 1300 (11th Cir. 2003), police officers shot an unarmed\nI\nCir. 1998) (officials immune from liability for rape of female student on college\nl\ncampus).\n15Three recent Eleventh Circuit panels recognized the import of Hope. In\nI\nHolloman v. Harland, Nos. 01-13864 & 01-15094 (11thCir., May 28, 2004), the\nCourt ruled that school authorities who disciplined students for not joining in the\nI\nPledge of Allegiance were not entitled as a matter of law to qualified immunity. In\nVineyard v. Wilson, 311 F.3d 1340 (11thCir. 2002), the Court relied on Hope to\nreject qualified immunity in an excessive force context. And in Holmes v.\nI\nKucynda, 321 F.3d 1069 (11 thCir. 2003), the Court rejected qualified immunity for\nan unlawful arrest. Were it not for the Court's recent awards of immunity in the\nI\nother cases discussed, Amici would be encouraged by these developments.\nI 13\n\nI\nI\nwoman eight times. Rejecting the jury's findings that this force was unnecessary\nI\nand excessive, as well as the conclusion of the District Court and a prior appellate\npanel that the police should have known better, the Court found that the officers\ni\nwere entitled to immunity.\nI\nIn Thomas v. Roberts, 261 F.3d 1160 (11th Cir. 2001), vacated, 536 U.S. 953\nI\n(2002), affirmed on remand, 323 F.3d 950 (11thCir. 2003), schoolchildren were\nI\nstrip-searched in a vain quest for $26. Although the Court had \"little trouble\nI\nconcluding\" that the searches were unconstitutional, were \"highly intrusive ... [and]\nclearly represent[ed] a 'serious intrusion upon the student's personal rights,'\" 261\nI\nF.3d at 1168-69, it still awarded the officials immunity. It ignored a decade's worth\nI\nof precedent j6 invalidating strip searches in the absence of particularized suspicion.\nI\nSee also Jenkins v. Talladega City Bd. of Educ., 95 F.3d 1036 (1 lth Cir. 1996),\nI\nreversed, 115 F.3d 821 (1 lth Cir. 1997) (en banc).\nOnly in Vaughan v. Cox, 264 F.3d 1027 (11thCir. 2001), vacated, 536 U.S.\nI\n953 (2002), affirmed on remand, 316 F.3d 1210 (11 thCir.), reversed sua sponte,\nI\nI 16Courts have ruled for well over a decade that strip searches in schools,\nabsent particularized suspicion, violate the Fourth Amendment. See Doe v.\nRenfrow, 631 F.2d 91, 93 (7th Cir. 1980); Bell v. Marseilles Elementary Sch., 160\nI\nF. Supp.2d 833 (N.D. Ill. 2001);Konop v. Northwestern Sch. Dist., 26 F. Supp.2d\n1189, 1205 (D.S.D. 1998); Oliver v. McClung, 919 F. Supp. 1206, 1218 (N.D. Ind.\nI\n1995); Burnham v. West, 681 F. Supp. 1160, 1165 (E.D.Va 1987).\nI 14\n\nI\nI\n343 F.3d 1323 (1 IthCir. 2003), did the Eleventh Circuit properly apply Hope.\nI\nThere, police shot into a truck without warning, seriously wounding the passenger,\nI when the truck's driver failed to immediately stop. Even though ajury could have\nfound that neither the victim nor driver were threats, and that deadly force was\nI\nunnecessary and excessive, the Eleventh Circuit (before Hope) concluded that the\nI\nofficers were entitled to qualified immunity.\nI\nFollowing vacatur and remand from the Supreme Court, the Eleventh Circuit\nI\nagain concluded that the police officer was entitled to qualified immunity. 316 F.3d\nat 1213. Recognizing that excessive force claims have been clearly established for\nI\na number of years throughout the United States, and rejecting the Eleventh Circuit's\nI\nill-starred \"materially similar\" formula (per the Supreme Court's instruction) Judge\nI\nNoonan dissented: \"it is difficult to discem why, if police officers in Tennessee and\nI\nMinnesota and Connecticut were on notice that the use of lethal force to restrain a\nI suspect is unreasonable, Georgia police officers should be supposed slow to have\nlearned.\" Id. at 1215 (Noonan, J., dissenting).\nI\nNot long after handing down its split decision in Vaughan, the Eleventh\nI\nCircuit sua sponte granted rehearing and rightly changed its mind. The court\nI\nobserved that \"the Supreme Court in Hope cautioned that we should not be unduly\nI rigid in requiring factual similarity between prior cases and the case under\nI 15\n\nI\nI\nconsideration. The 'salient question' the [Supreme] Court said, is whether the state\nI\nof the law gave the defendants 'fair warning'.\" 343 F.3d at 1332. \"Taking the facts\nI as alleged by [the Appellee], an objectively reasonable officer ... could not have\nbelieved that he was entitled to use deadly force .... \" Id.\nI\nAll three cases, Willingham, Thomas and Vaughan, involved egregious\nI\nviolations that would have resulted in denials of qualified immunity in any other\nI\ncircuit. It is unfortunate that in two of those cases the wrongdoers were insulated\nI\nfrom relief by the Eleventh Circuit's continuing use of its \"materially similar\"\nstandard. It is equally unfortunate that the original panel in the present case sought\nI\nto award qualified immunity to a government official who, if the Appellees'\nI\nallegations are believed, clearly has no respect for human dignity or the rule of law.\nI\nNothing is s_ved by summarily protecting government officials under these\nI\ncircumstances. Quite to the contrary, summary judgment under these circumstances\nI sends the wrong message to police and prison guards. It tells them they can do\nwhatever they want. This is not wha the United States is about, domestically or\nI\nabroad. See Bradley Graham and David Von Drehle, Bush Apologizes for Abuse of\nI\nPrisoners, Wash. Post, May 7, 2004, at A1 (stating that President Bush apologized\nI\npublicly for American military's abuse of Iraqi prisoners).\nI Numerous cases from other Circuits have employed Hope's reasoning to\nI 16\n\nI\nI\nreject qualified immunity in the context of excessive force. In Wall v, County of\nI\nOrange, 364 F.3d 1107 (9thCir. 2004), for example, the Ninth Circuit reversed a\nI\nDistrict Court's award of qualified immunity in a case charging a police officer\nwith excessive force. \"If a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the\nI\nparties' submissions, the next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly\ni\nestablished. This requirement does not mean that the very action at issue must have\ni\nbeen held unlawful before qualified immunity is shed.\" Id. at 1111. Likwise, in\nI\nCowan v. Breen, 352 F.3d 756 (2d Cir. 2003), where the estate of a motorist who\ni was fatally shot by police brought suit for excessive force, the Second Circuit\naffirmed the District Court's denial of qualified immunity. \"[W]hether it was\nI\nreasonable for [the police officer] to believe that his life or person was in danger,\"\nI\nthe court concluded, was a question for the jury. The Third Circuit reached this\nI\nsame conclusion inRivas v. City of Passaic, 365 F.3d 181 (3d Cir. 2004), another\nI excessive force case. Following the District Court's denial of summary judgment\nbased on qualified immunity, police charged with excessive force took an\nI\ninterlocutory appeal to the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit affirmed because a\nI\n\"reasonable jury could find from these facts that [the victim] did not present a threat\nl\nto anyone's safety.\" Id. at 200.\nI These cases, and numerous others in various constitutional settings, see, e.g.,\ni 17\n\nI\nI\nSuboh v. District Attorneys Office of Suffolk District, 298 F.3d 81 (1st Cir. 2002)\n!\n(denying qualified immunity where custody was unlawfully transferred to\n! grandparents who fled with child); Loria v. Gorman, 306 F.3d 1271 (2d Cir. 2002)\n(denying qualified immunity in fourth amendment context); Atkinson v. Taylor, 316\nI\nF.3d 257 (3d Cir. 2003) (denying qualified immunity to prison guards who\nl\nsubjected prisoner to environmental tobacco smoke); Burchett v. Kiefer, 310 F.3d\nI\n937 (6th Cir. 2002) (denying qualified immunity where suspect detained in police\ni\ncar for three hours with dosed windows in ninety degree heat); Bell v. Johnson, 308\nF.3d 594 (6th Cir. 2002) (denying qualified immunity where guard seized prisoners\nI\nlegal papers and medical dietary material); Hawla'ns v. Holloway, 316 F.3d 777 (8th\nI\nCir. 2003) (denying qualified immunity where sheriff pointed loaded gun at\ni\ndeputies); Roska v. Peterson, 304 F.3d 982 (10th Cir. 2002) (denying qualified\nI\nimmunity where police summarily seized child), prove that Hope is more than a\nrestatement of the Eleventh Circuit's prior, \"rigid\" approach. Hope changes\ni\neverything in the Eleventh Circuit.\ni\nII. A Consensus of Cases Clearly Establish that Suspidonless Strip-\ni Searches of Suspected Misdemeanants Violate the Fourth\nAmendment.\nI\nClearly established law, according to the Eleventh Circuit, can only be found\nin the published decisions of the Supreme Court, Eleventh Circuit, and the supreme\nI\nI 18\n\nI\nI\ncourt of the state where the action arose. See Hamilton v. Cannon, 80 F.3d 1525,\nI\n1531-32 n.7 (1 lth Cir. 1996);D'Aguanno v. Gallagher, 50 F.3d 877, 881 n.6 (1 lth\n! Cir. 1995); Jenkins v. Talladega CityBd. of Educ., 115 F.3d 821 (1 lth Cir. 1997)\n(en banc). Persuasive precedent is irrelevant in the Eleventh Circuit.\nI\nHope, and the Supreme Court's ruling in Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603,617\nI\n(1999), prove that this practice is wrong. Hope makes clear that case-law is not\nI\neven needed to overcome immunity. The question is one of fair warning, notice\ni\nand common sense. In Wilson, the Supreme Court addressed for the first time\nwhether search warrants authorize media access to individuals' homes. It concluded\nI\nthey do not. In awarding qualified immunity to the responsible officers, it looked\nI\nnot only to binding precedent, but also to persuasive precedent. The question,\nI\naccording to the Supreme Court in Wilson, is whether a \"consensus of persuasive\ni\nauthority\" put the wrongdoers on notice. Because of Wilson and Hope, this\nI Court's contrary practice, see, e.g., Marsh v. Butler County, 268 F.3d at 1032 n. 10,\nis clearly misguided.\ni\nEvery other Circuit to address the matter since Wilson v. Layne has reached\ni\nthis conclusion. See, e.g., Rogers v. Pendleton, 249 F.3d 279, 287 (4th Cir. 2001);\nI\nButera v. District of Columbia, 235 F.3d 637, 652 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Jacobs v.\n,I Chicago, 215 F.3d 7:58, 767 (7th Cir. 2000); Vaughn v. Ruoff 253 F.3d 1124, 1130\nI 19\n\nI\nI\n(8th Cir. 2001); Virgili v. Gilbert, 272 F.3d 391,393 (6_hCir. 2001); Doe v. Delio,\nI\n257 F.3d 309, 332 (3d Cir. 2001) (Nygaard, J., concurring and dissenting). Indeed,\nI even before Wilson most courts concluded that persuasive authority was relevant to\nthe question of clearly established law. See Ohio Civil Service Employees Ass 'n v.\nI\nSeiter, 858 F.2d 1171, 1177 (dh Cir. 1988); Shabazz v. Coughlin, 852 F.2d 697, 701\n!\n(2d Cir. 1988); Biergegu v. Reno, 59 F.3d 1445, 1459 (3rdCir. 1995); Capoeman v.\nI\nReed, 754 F.2d 1512, 1514-15 (9th Cir. 1985). This Court's contrary approach\nI should be discarded. _7 It is a remnant of bygone days that, in light of Hope, cannot\nbe maintained.\ni\nLower court cases from across the country have condemned suspicionless\nI\nstrip-searches ofpre-trial detainees charged with misdemeanors for two decades.\nI\nHills v. Bogan, 735 F.2d 391,394-95 (10 thCir. 1984); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d\nI 614, 618-19 (9thCir. 1984); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 804 (2d Cir. 1986); Watt\nv. Richardson Police Department, 849 F.2d 195, 196 (5thCir. 1988); Swain v.\ni\nSpinney, 117 F.3d 1, 9 (1stCir. 1997). The majority in the present case erred by not\nI\nlooking to this consensus of persuasive precedent for guidance. See Evans, 351\nI\n_TAmicus is not arguing that a consensus of persuasive cases always\nI\novercomes immunity. Nor is Amicus suggesting that a consensus of persuasive\ncases can displace Eleventh Circuit precedent. Amicus's argument is that\nI\npersuasive authority can prove relevant to the qualified immunity inquiry.\nI 20\n\nI\nI\nF.3d at 494 n. 15 ('Only decisions of the Supreme Court, the Eleventh Circuit, and\nI\nthe highest court of the relevant state clearly establish law for purposes of qualified\nI immunity.\"). Had the panel properly looked to persuasive precedent, per the\nSupreme Court's directions in Wilson and Hope, it would have found that\nI\nsuspicionless strip-searches are clearly illegal.\ni This unanimity was recently recognized in Savard v. Rhode Island, 338\nI\nF.3d 23 (1stCir. 2003) (en banc). There, pre-trial detainees who were accused of\nI non-violent and non-drug-related crimes were, pursuant to state policy, often\ncommingled with convicted prisoners. Before entering the prison, all detainees\nI\nwere required to undergo strip-searches. The District Court concluded that the\nI\nprison guards who conducted the searches were entitled to qualified immunity. On\nI\nappeal, the First Circuit initially reversed. See Savard v. Rhode Island, 320 F.3d 34\n!\n(1stCir. 2003). Like all other courts to address the issue, it concluded that strip-\nI searches of pre-lxial detainees are unconstitutional unless supported by reasonable\nsuspicion. Because this rule was established no later than 1996 in the First Circuit,\nI\nthe guards should have been denied immunity.\ni\nOn rehearing en banc, an evenly divided First Circuit affirmed the District\nI\nCourt's award of qu_dified immunity. Four of the judges found that because the\npre-trial detainees were commingled with those convicted of violent crimes and\nI\nI 21\n\ni\ni held in a maximum-security prison, application of the otherwise clear rule\ni\nprohibiting strip-searches was murky. All eight judges agreed that if the detainees\n!\nhad been held separately, and not commingled with convicted prisoners, the strip\nsearches would have been clearly illegal. \"We declared [in Swain v. Spinne3.,, 117\ni\nF.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1997)] the strip search unconstitutional, holding that strip-\nI\nsearching an arrestee ordinarily requires at least reasonable suspicion that the\nI\nperson arrested is concealing contraband or weapons.\" 338 F.3d at 29 (Selya, J.,\nI\nspeaking for four members of the court). Only because \"[t]here are important\nI differences between detaining an arrestee in virtual isolation and introducing an\narrestee into the general population of a maximum security prison\" did Judge Selya\nI\nconclude the prohibition was not clear. Id. at 29. Judge Bownes, writing for the\n1\nother four judges, stated: \"Swain states unequivocally that reasonable suspicion is\nI\nrequired to strip search arrestees and that this requirement was clearly established as\nI early a 1993, well before the dates in question here. These rulings were in\nconformity with circuits across the country.\" Id. at 37 (Bownes, J., speaking for\nI\nfour members of the court). It was thus clear long before 1999 that strip-searching\ni those arrested for minor crimes without suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment.\nI\nSee also Sla_rstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678 (11 _hCir. 2000) (holding tha prison\nI policy requiring strip searches of all those being detained did not comport with\ni 22\nI\n\ni\nI\nFourth Amendment).\nI\nI' III. Interlocutory Appellate Factfinding Is Improper.\nThe Eleventh Circuit, unlike its sister Circuits, has an unfortunate history of\nI\nengaging in interlocutory appellate factfinding. In Mencer v. Hammonds, 134 F.3d\nI\n1066 (11 thCir. 1998), for example, the plaintiff(Mencer) sued under § 1983\ni\nclaiming aracially motivated discharge. The District Court denied summary\nI\njudgment based on qualified immunity, finding that Mencer had \"produced\nsufficient evidence of conduct violative of the equal protection clause on the part of\nI\n[the defendant to] ... violate[] clearly established law.\" Id. at 1068. Qualified\nI\nimmunity was, in Amici's opinion, properly denied. See Hohnes v. Kucynda, 321\ni\nF.3d 1069 (11 th Cir. 2003).\nI\nOn interlocutory appeal, this Court concluded that it was authorized to\nI \"review the district court's preliminary [factual] determination as a means of\nreaching the issue of clearly established law.\" 134 F.3d at 1070. It explained that a\nI\n\"denial of qualified immunity at summary judgment necessarily involves two\nI\ndeterminations: 1) that on the facts before the court, taken in the light most\nI\nfavorable to the plaintiff, a reasonable jury could find that the defendant engaged in\nI certain conduct, and 2) that the conduct violated 'clearly established law' ....\" Id.\ni 23\n\nI\ni\nEven though it recognized that the first determination was not appealable, id. (citing\nI\nJohnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304 (1995)), the Court concluded that because a\nI \"determination of whether the evidence supports finding that a defendant engaged\nin certain conduct ... is necessary to reach a determination of whether that conduct\ni\nviolated clearly established law,\" id., it could review the District Court's factual\nI\nanalysis. Contrary to the District Court's finding, the Eleventh Circuit found\nI\ninsufficient evidence of discrimination and awarded the defendant qualified\nI immunity, ld. at 1071. See also Stanley v. City of Dalton, 219 F.3d 1280 (11th Cir.\n2000) (finding insuffident evidence on interlocutory appeal).\nI\nMencer ably demonstrates how far astray the Eleventh Circuit has gone.\n!\nSome rights, like the right to be free from invidious racial discrimination, have been\nI\nso thoroughly litigated that their contours are crystal clear. See, e.g., Murphy v.\nI\nArkansas, 127 F.3d 750, 755 (8th Cir. 1997); Tang v. State of Rhode lsland, Dep't\nof Elderly Affairs, 120 F.3_d 325,327 (lst Cir. 1997). See generally John C.\ni\nJeffries, Jr., Disaggregating Constitutional Tort_; 110 Yale L. J. 259, 277 (2000)\nI\n(\"Someone who purposely discriminates against racial minorities cannot claim that\nI\nhe or she reasonably thought such action to be lawful.\"); Armacost, supra, at 591\nI\n(\"Today, discrimination against someone because she is African-American or\nI Hispanic is viewed as inherently and obviously 'bad' behavior, obviating the need\nI 24\n\nI\nI\nfor qualified immunity\").\nI\nThe law's clarity is thus not at issue in racial discrimination cases. Fact - the\nI defendant's intent - is the only question. As made clear in Johnson v. Jones, 515\nU.S. 304 (l 995), appellate courts should not review the sufficiency of the plaintiff's\ni\nevidence under guise of qualified immunity on interlocutory appeal. Interlocutory\ni jurisdiction over qualified immunity is confined to questions of law. 18 The Mencer\nI\nCourt was thus clearly wrong when it addressed the sufficiency of the plaintiff's\nI proof. 19\nFollowing Johnson, every Circuit - except the Eleventh - has expressly and\nI\nI\n1sit was argued in Johnson that factual issues sometimes append themselves\nto legal ones, and thus technically fall under an appellate court's pendent appellate\njurisdiction. The Supreme Court responded: \"Even assuming, for the sake of\ni\nargument, that it may sometimes be appropriate to exercise 'pendent appellate\nI jurisdiction' over such a matter, it seems unlikely that courts of appeals would do so\n....\" ld. \"[T]he court of appeals can simply take, as given, the facts that the district\ncourt assumed when it denied summary judgment for that (purely legal) reason.\"\nld. at 319. Should the lower court fail to make findings or state its assumptions, the\nI\nCourt of Appeals need only review the record to determine \"what facts the district\nI court, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, likely assumed.\" Id. The\nSupreme Court did not seriously entertain the notion that appellate courts might\nengage in their own form of fact-finding.\nI\n19But see Koch v. Rugg, 221 F.3d 1283, 1297 (11th Cir. 2000) (\"When\ndiscriminatory intent is a predicate factual element of the underlying constitutional\nI\ntort, we have recognized that sufficiency of discriminatory-intent evidence\ngenerally is not part of the core qualified immunity analysis\" and thus is not subject\nI to interlocutory review).\nI 25\n\nunequivocally rejected interlocutory review of factual sufficiency in the context of\nqualified immunity. In Hulen v. Yates, 322 F.3d 1229 (10 thCir. 2003), for example,\nthe District Court denied summary judgment to a defendant who allegedly violated\nthe First Amendment by transferring a public-sector employee. On interlocutory\nappeal, the Tenth Circuit stated that it could 'Mot resolve Defendants' claims that\n[the plaintiff] cannot show any personal participation by these Defendants in the\nalleged retaliatory transfer because of his motivation. This is an issue of evidentiary\nsufficiency, over which we lack jurisdiction in a qualified immunity interlocutory\nappeal.\" /d. at 1240. Similarly, in Hamilton v. Leavy, 322 F.3d 776, 782 (3d Cir.\n2002), a case involving deliberate indifference to a prisoner's Eighth Amendment\nrights, the Third Circuit refused to review \"the District Court's 'identification of the\nfacts that are subject to genuine dispute,' but instead ... review[ed] the legal issues\nin light of the facts that the District Court determined had sufficient evidentiary\nsupport for summary judgment purposes.\" See also Cavalieri v. Shepard, 321 F.3d\n616, 618 (7thCir. 2003) (\"we have no appellate jurisdiction to the extent disputed\nfacts are central to the case\"); Atkinson v. Taylor, 316 F.3d 257, 261 (3d Cir. 2003)\n(same).\nEvery other Circuit to address the problem agrees that interlocutory appellate\nreview is not the proper time for drawing conclusions about the reasonableness of a\n26\n\nI\nI\npolice officer's force. In Cowan v. Breen, 352 F.3d 756 (2d Cir. 2003), for\nI\nexample, the estate of a motorist who was fatally shot by police brought suit for\nI excessive force. The police officer unsuccessfully moved for qualified immunity in\nthe District Court and then took an interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit.\nI\nFinding that qualified inmaunity- \"whether it was reasonable for [the police\nI\nofficer] to believe that his life or person was in danger\" - constituted the \"very\nI\nquestion upon which [it and the District Court] found there are genuine issues of\nI material fact,\" id. at 764, the Second Circuit affirmed. Although it had jurisdiction\nto address the interlocutory appeal, it had no authority to revisit the District Court's\ni\nassessment of the facts.\nI\nThe Third Circuit reached this same conclusion in Rivas v. City of Passaic,\n365 F.3d 181 (3d Cir. 2004), another excessive force case. Following the District\ni\nI\nCourt's denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity, police charged\nwith excessive force took an interlocutory appeal to the Third Circuit. The court\nI\nstated that \"if a defendant in a constitutional tort case moves for summary judgment\ni\nbased on qualified immunity and the district court denies the motion, we lack\nI\njurisdiction to consider whether the district court correctly identified the set of facts\nthat the summary judgment record is sufficient to prove .... \" ld. at 192 (quoting\nI\nI Ziccardi v. City of Philadelphia, 288 F.3d 57, 61 (3d Cir. 2002)). Because a\ni 27\n\n\"reasonable jury could find from these facts that [the victim] did not present a threat\nto anyone's safety,\" id. at 200, the Third Circuit affirmed the lower court's denial of\nsummary judgment. See also Beier v. City of Lewiston, 354 F.3d 1058 (qh Cir.\n2004) (suggesting that interlocutory appeal does not even lie in excessive force\ncase). See also Kent v. Katz, 312 F.3d 568 (2d Cir. 2002) (Second Circuit affirms\nDistrict Court's refusal to award summary judgment and refuses to resolve the\nfactual issues that surrounded lawfulness of arrest); Gray Hopkins v. Prince\nGeorge's County, 309 F.3d 224, 229 (4thCir. 2002) (Fourth Circuit refuses to\nassess reasonableness of police officer's force on interlocutory review); Treats v.\nMorgan, 308 F.3d 868, 874 (8thCir. 2002); Kinney v. Weaver, 301 F.3d 253,261\n(5thCir. 2002).\nConcluding that a police officer might have reasonably felt threatened is just\nthe sort of factual conclusion that is left for resolution in the District Court. When\nthe District Court concludes that the factual issue is genuinely disputed, and not ripe\nfor summary judgment, this Court has no authority on interlocutory appeal to\ndisagree.\nTo be sure, this does not mean that a District Court must deny summary\njudgment in every case where there exists a genuine issue of material fact.\nSometimes the law is simply not clear and summary judgment is in order. Even\n28\n\nl\nI\nwhen the law is clear, an official might still reasonably (though mistakenly) believe\nI\nthat his actions are lawful, even though the ultimate factual conclusion\nI (reasonableness) is genuinely at issue. The Supreme Court in Saucier v. Katz, 533\nU.S. 194 (2001), explained this latter possibility in the context of excessive force.\nI\nThere, in the course of removing a demonstrator from a military base, the officer\ni allegedly delivered the demonstrator a \"gratuitously violent shove.\" Because the\nI\nultimate reasonableness of this shove was genuinely at issue, the District Court\nI denied the officer's motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.\nThe Supreme Court reversed, concluding that even if the officer had shoved the\nI\ndemonstrator in this fashion, he could have reasonably believed it to be necessary.\ni\nEven though ajury would have sufficient evidence to return a verdict for the\nI\nplaintiff, the District Court could still award the officer qualified immunity. This is\nI a far cry, however, from holding that appellate courts have interlocutory jurisdiction\nto revisit a District Court's assessment of a plaintiff's facts, or to independently\nI\njudge the sufficiency of a plaintiff's case. Saucier means only that the qualified\nI\nimmunity standard applied by a District Court is not necessarily identical to the\nI\ngenuine issue standard generally employed to defeat summary judgment. Although\nI\nsmall, there is some room between the two standards. See Kopec v. Tate, 361 F.3d\n772 (3d Cir. 2004) (reversing District Court's award of qualified immunity to police\nI\n29\ni\n\nofficer accused of excessive force because Fourth Amendment principles were\nclearly established); Wall v. County of Orange, 364 F.3d 1107 (9thCir. 2004)\n(reversing District Court's award of qualified immunity to police officer charged\nwith excessive force because on plaintiff's \"version of the facts, [the officer] used\nexcessive force\"). Assuming the District Court applies the proper standards under\nSaucier, a reviewing court's jurisdiction on interlocutory appeal is limited to pure\nmatters of law; it does not include assessing the sufficiency of the plaintiff's\nevidence, and certainly does not include drawing ultimate factual conclusions - like\nwhether an officer's motivation was racial, see, e.g., Mencer, or whether he\nreasonably feared for his life or safety (as here). 2°\nThe Eleventh Circuit's tendency to engage in interlocutory factfinding,\nmoreover, is exacerbated by its use of a \"heightened pleading\" standard for § 1983\ncases. In Gonzalez v. Reno, 325 F.3d 1228 (11 thCir. 2003), for example, the\nplaintiffs alleged that federal agents, at the personal direction of the Attorney\nGeneral (Reno) and other supervisory officials, used excessive force to enter and\nsearch their home. The District Court denied these defendants motions for\n2°Amici are not arguing that the Eleventh Circuit cannot consider the\nsufficiency of the evidence following final judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Amici\nspeak to the propriety of this practice only in the context of interlocutory appeals,\nwhich are governed by Johnson.\n3O\n\nI\nI\nsummary judgment based on qualified immunity. On interlocutory appeal, this\nI\nCourt reversed and awarded qualified immunity because of the plaintiffs' failure to\nsatisfy the Eleventh Circuit's heightened pleading standard and its unwillingness to\ni\ndraw reasonable inferences in favor of § 1983 plaintiffs. \"Given the presumption of\ni\nlegitimacy accorded to official conduct, it would be unreasonable to draw from the\nI\nalleged facts the inference that the supervisory defendants directed the agents on the\nI\nscene to engage in the unconstitutional activity .... \" Id. at 1235. But this is exactly\nI what the Supreme Court's decisions in Johnson and Groh require. Johnson holds\nthat factual issues are not properly considered on interlocutory appeal. The\nI\nappellate court must give the benefit of any reasonable doubt to the plaintiff. Groh\nI\nholds that the burden is on the defense to establish immunity. There simply is no\nI\npresumption of legitimacy once the plaintiff has properly stated a constitutional\nI violation.\nThe Supreme Court in Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574 (1998),\nI\nmoreover, expressly rejected a heightened evidentiary standard for § 1983\nI\nplaintiffs, and by clear implication any heightened pleading standard. Since that\nI\ndecision, every Circuit to address the matter except the Eleventh, See, e.g., GJR\nI\nInvestments, lnc. v. County of Escambia, 132 F.3d 1359, 1367 (1 lth Ctr.1998), and\nFifth, see, e.g., Nunez v. Simms, 341 F.3d 385 (5th Cir. 2003), has abandoned\nI\nI 31\n\nI\nI\nheightened pleading requirements. See Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307\nI\nF.3d 1119, 1125 (9th Cir.2002); Harbury v. Deutch, 233 F.3d 596, 611 (D.C. Cir.\nI 2000), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403\n(2002); Currier v. Doran, 242 F.3d 905,916 (10th Cir.); Nance v. Vieregge, 147\nI\nF.3d 589, 590 (7th Cir.1998); Goad v. Mitchell 297 F.3d 497 (6th Cir.2002);\nI\nTrulock v. Freeh, 275 F.3d 391 (4thCir. 2001). See also Black v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d\nI\n72, 75 (2d Cir. 1996) (rejecting heightened pleading before Britton). Contrast\nI Judge v. City of Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 72-75 (1st Cir. 1998) (retaining heightened\npleading standard for some § 1983 claims), with Greenier v. Pace, Local No. 1188,\nI\n201 F.Supp.2d 172, 177 (D. Me. 2002) (holding that Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,\nI\n534 U.S. 506 (2002) ovmums First Circuit's approach).\nI\nAlthough the original panel in the present case properly respected many of\nI\nthe District Court's factual assumptions and inferences, on one important occasion\nI\nit reached out to draw its own factual conclusion. The record below shows that\ni when Stephens ordered Jordan to remove his clothes, Jordan turned to protest. \"A\nreasonable officer in these circumstances could have interpreted this as resistance to\nI\nthe search, and could have reasonably believed that the application of some force,\nI\nincluding a choke hold, to facilitate the search would not violate the Constitution.\"\nI\n351 F.3d at 495. This sort of interlocutory factfinding is impermissible under\nI 32\n\nI\nI\nJohnson. Appellate courts exercising interlocutory jurisdiction must accept all\nI\nfactual allegations as true. All reasonable inferences and conclusions must be\nI drawn in favor of the plaintiff (the non-moving party). Although a reasonable\npolice officer in Stephens' situation might have felt threatened, a reasonable officer\nI\ncould have just as easily felt secure. Resolution of this ultimate factual conclusion\ni is left to the District Court. It should not be addressed anew by an appellate court\nI\nexercising interlocutory appellate jurisdiction.\nI CONCLUSION\nAmici do not wish to appear overly pessimistic about the Eleventh Circuit's\nI\napproach to qualified immunity. Indeed, on occasion this Court has refused to\nI\naward qualified immunity to public officials. See, e.g., Holloman v. Harland, Nos.\nI\n01-13864 & 01-15094 (11 thCir., May 28, 2004); Vinyard v. Wilson, 311 F.3d 1340\nI (1 1th Cir. 2002);Holmes v. Kucynda, 321 F.3d 1069 (11 th Cir. 2003). The Eleventh\nCircuit's overwhelming tendency, however, is to stray far from the mainstream of\nI\nqualified immunity jurisprudence. See Mark R. Brown, The Failure of Fault Under\nI\n591983: Municipal Liability for State Law Enforcement, 84 Cornell L. Rev. 1503,\nI\n1508-10 & n.52 (1999). Hope and Groh make this clear. The result is that\nI governmental officials - especially police - prove immune from liability in the\nEleventh Circuit in almost every case. This unfortunate result not only encourages\nI\nI 33\n\nI\nl\nofficial lawlessness, it upsets the delicate system of checks and balances upon\nl\nwhich our civilized society is based. Se.__S._t_eveen Pinker, The Blank Slate: The\nl Modem Denial of Human Nature 332 (2002) (\"civil libertarians concern about\nabusive police practices is an indispensable counterweight to the monopoly on\nl\nviolence we grant the state\"); Mark R. Brown, Deterring Bully Government.\" A\nl\nSovereign Dilemma, 76 Tulane L. Rev. 149, 155 (2001) (\"governmental bullies can\nI\nand should be punished through monetary damages, both for their own good and for\nl the good of the governed.\")\nThe Eleventh Circuit stands alone in its focus on factual identity, its\nl\ninterlocutory eagemess to review factual sufficiency, its rejection of persuasive\nl\nprecedent, and its predisposition toward immunity. Hope and Groh are clear calls\nl\nfor moderation and change. Amici respectfully requests that this Court heed those\nl calls.\n1\nRespectfully submitted,\nl\nl\nRandall C. Marshall Mark R.

The Alabama League of\nMunicipalities is an organization which represents the rights and interests of its\nmembers, some 200 plus municipalities throughout the State of Alabama. Amicus's\ninterest in this case is based on its belief that the opinion of the District Court will\nresult in increased and uncertain litigation concerning strip searches conducted by law\nenforcement personnel and agencies of the various Alabama municipalities. Amicus\nhas been and remains committed to representing the rights and interests of its\nmembers and municipalities and is authorized by those municipalities to represent\ninunicipal interests and_to defend those interests whenever and wherever attacked.\nAs such, Amicus is authorized by its members to represent its interests, not only\nbefore legislative bodies, but also as it regards court decisions, that Amicus believes\nwill negatively impact its member municipalities.\n\nI\nI\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nI\nFrom approximately 1974 onward, the United States Supreme Court has\nI\ndeveloped evolving standards for evaluating the constitutionality of prisoners' rights\nI claims. In cases such as Procunier v. Martinez, Pell v. Procunier, and Jones v. North\nCarolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., tile Court considered such standards as\nI\nwhether the regulation or practice in question ft, rthered an important governmental\nI\ninterest of security, order, and rehabilitation, whether the limitation of the\nI\nconstitutional freedom was greater than necessary or essential to the protection of the\nI particular governmental interest involved, and whether there was an alternative means\nof protecting the disputed rights.\nI\nIn 1979 the Supreme Court decided Bell v. Wolfish., which spoke directly to\nI\nthe issue of strip search policies in detention facilities. In Bell, the Court applied a\nI\nbalancing test, focusing primarily on the justification for the strip search policy. This\nI\nbalancing test examination resulted in the Court's conclusion that blanket strip\nsearches can be conducted on less than probable cause.\nI\nFinally, in Turner v. Safley, tile Supreme Court combined many of the tests\nI\ndeveloped in the aforementioned cases to establish the following four-part algorithm:\nI\n1) There must be a 'valid, rational connection' between the prison regulation and the\nI\nlegitimate governmental interest put lbrward to justify it, 2) A court must inquire as\nI 2\n\nto whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to\nprison inmates; 3) A court must consider the impact accommodation of the asserted\nconstitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of\nprison resources generally; and 4) A court must recognize that the absenceof ready\nalternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation.\nAmicus Curiae argue that, under the Bell balancing test, the introduction of a\ndetainee into the general jail population is pet\" se exceptional circumstances which\nshouldjusti_ a strip search. Such contact presents the opportunity for contraband to\nbe introduced into the general jail population, where it may result in physical harm\nto the detainees or the jail personnel.\nFurther, under the four-part Turner algorithm, such a policy is still\nconstitutionally valid. A detention facility has a legitimate penological interest in\npreventing the introduction of weapons, drugs, money, and other contraband into the\ngeneral inmate population. The use of a strip search is both exceptionally effective\nand directly related to the goal of keeping the general jail population free from such\ndangerous and/or disruptive paraphernalia. Unfortunately, a strip search necessarily\nand pointedly infringes on an inmate's constitutional right to privacy, and there is no\nreasonable way for the detainee to mitigate this infringement. However, the intrusion\nis substantially outweighed by the institutional interest in protecting its staff, guards,\n\nI\nI\nand the prison population at large. Any accommodation of the inmate's right to\nI\nprivacy, e.g. failure to perfoma the strip search altogether, would defeat the goal of\nI\nthe policy of maintaining the safety and order of the facility. Alternative methods of\nI search and detection, such as metal detectors, are inherently incapable of revealing\nthe myriad of objects and materials which a visual search would turn up, and are\nI\nprohibitively costly. Finally, it is apparent that no reasonable alternative to a strip\nI\nsearch exists which would accomplish the proper and legitimate goals of a detention\nI\nthcility. Such absence of an alternative, according to the Turner Court, is evidence\nI of the reasonableness of the policy in dispute.\nIt is apparent from Supreme Court case law that a blanket strip search policy\n!\napplied to arrestees and pretrial detainees who will come into contact with the\nI\ndetention facility's general population can be reasonable, and therefore constitutional,\nI\nlack of reasonable suspicion notwithstanding. However, should this Court find\nI otherwise, the questions then remain, for qualified immunity purposes, whether a) the\nlaw was clearly established, prior to January 21, 1999, that a police officer needed at\nI\nleast reasonable suspicion before subjecting an arrestee to strip searches prior to\nI\nintroducing him into the general population of the jail, and b) whether a reasonable\nI\npolice officer, situated similarly to the Appellant, would have understood at that time\nI\nthat the policy in place at the jail offended the Constitution.\nI 4\n\nI\nI\nThe only two binding precedents available on January 21, 1999, Bell v.\nI\nWolfish and Justice v. City of Peachtree City, both found strip searches\nI\nconstitutional. Therefbre, the Appellant could have reasonably thought, based on the\nI relevant controlling case law, that there was room in the law for the blanket strip\nsearch policy. To the degree that the facts in these two controlling cases are\nI\ndistinguishable in a fair way from the facts in the case at bar, then neither of them can\nI\nbe said to have clearly established the law for purposes of a qualified immunity\nI\ndetermination in the instant case.\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nARGUMENT\nI\nPrecedential Case Law Dictates That Arrestees Who Are To Be Detained\nIt\nIn The General Jail Population Can Constitutionally Be Subjected To\nI\nStrip Searches Without A Requirement Of Reasonable Suspicion.\nI There was a time not too long ago when the federal judiciary took\na completely \"hands-off\" approach to the problem of prison\nadministration. In recent years, however, these courts largely have\nI\ndiscarded this \"hands-off' attitude and waded into this complex arena•\n• . . But many of these same courts have, in the name of the\nI Constitution, become increasingly enmeshed in the minutiae of prison\noperations. Judges, after all, are human. They, no less than others in\nour society, have a natural tendency to believe that their individual\nI\nsolutions to often intractable problems are better and more workable\nthan those of the persons who are actually charged with and trained in\nI the running of the particular institution under examination. But under\nthe Constitution, the first question to be answered is not whose plan is\nbest, but in what branch of the Government is lodged the authority to\nI\ninitially devise the plan. This does not mean that constitutional rights\nare not to be scrupulously observed• It does mean, however, that the\nI inquiry of federal courts into prison management must be limited to the\nissue of whether a particular system violates any prohibition of the\nConstitution or, in the case of a federal prison, a statute• The wide range\nI\nof \"judgment calls\" that meet constitutional and statutory requirements\nare confided to officials outside of the Judicial Branch of Government.\nI\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979)•\nI\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \"[t]he right\nI of the people to be secure in their persons.., against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, shall not be violated•\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. It is long-established that\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\na strip search t is a search and seizure, and therefore subject to the reasonableness test\nI\nof the Fourth Amendment. While state and federal courts today have unquestionably\nI\nheld that _he Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable strip searches, there remains\nI the elusive question as to how to define \"unreasonable\" or, conversely, what context\nor circumstance endows a strip search with the virtue of \"reasonableness.\"\nI\nSpecifically, for purposes of the case at bar, the question arises as to the\ni\nreasonableness of a detention facility's blanket policy requiring that arrestees and pre-\nI\ntrial detainees who are to be detained in the facility's general population be subjected\nI to a strip search without prerequisite probable cause. A careful review of\nauthoritative and persuasive case law demonstrates conclusively that such a blanket\nI\npolicy can be constitutionally upheld.\nI\ni\nI\n1The term \"strip search\" has achieved a level and degree of usage which is\nimprecise, having been applied to conduct ranging from a \"visual strip search,\"\ni\nwherein a prisoner is required to disrobe completely and perhaps submit to\nexamination of his mouth, hands and feet, to a \"visual body cavity strip search,\"\nwherein an inmate must lift his genitals (if male), and spread his or her buttocks, for\nI\nvisual inspection. For purposes of this Brief, the use of the term \"strip search\" will\nencompass both of the aforementioned activities. However, the definition of\"strip\ni\nsearch\" as contemplated in this Brief specifically does no__!tinclude any physically\nintrusive procedure such as manual body cavity search, wherein the genitals and/or\nI anus are penetrated or physically manipulated by the searcher's fingers or other\ninstrument.\nI\n\nI\nI\nA. Procunier v. Martinez\nI\nInitially, the United States Supreme Court in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S.\nI\n396 (1974) recognized the difficulty inherent in judicial intervention into prison\nadministration.\nI\nTraditionally, federal courts have adopted a broad, hands-off attitude\nI\ntoward problems of prison administration. In part this policy is the\nproduct of various limitations on the scope of federal review of\nI conditions in state penal institutions. More fundamentally, this attitude\nsprings from complementary perceptions about the nature of the\nproblems and the efficacy of judicial intervention. Prison administrators\nI\nare responsible for maintaining internal order and discipline, for\nsecuring their institutions against unauthorized access or escape, and for\nI rehabilitating, to the extent that human nature and inadequate resources\nallow, the inmates placed in their custody. The Herculean obstacles to\neffective discharge of these duties are too apparent to warrant\nI\nexplication. Suffice it to say that the problems of prisons in America are\ncomplex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are not readily\nI susceptible of resolution by decree. Most require expertise,\ncomprehensive planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which\nare peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive\nI\nbranches of government. For all of those reasons, courts are ill equipped\nto deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration\nI and reform. Judicial recognition of that fact reflects no more than a\nhealthy sense of realism. Moreover, where state penal institutions are\ninvolved, federal courts have a further reason for deference to the\nI\nappropriate prison authorities.\nI Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974). See also Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.\n78, 84-85 (1987).\nI\nI\nI 8\n\nNevertheless, despite this acknowledged difficulty the Court went on to\ndescribe the principles that frame an analysis of prisoners 'z constitutional claims.\nFirst, the Court stated that \"the regulation or practice:in question must further an\nimportant governmental interest.\" Martinez, 416 U.S. at 413. The regulation must\nfurther \"one or more of the substantial governmental interest of security, order, and\nrehabilitation.\" Id___S:.econd, the limitation of the constitutional freedom \"must be no\ngreater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental\ninterest involved.\" ld___a,t, 413-14.\nB. Pell v. Proeunier\nFollowing Martinez, but during the same Tenn, the Supreme Court decided\nPell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817 (1974). The Court in Pell recognized that \"lawful\nincarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges\nand rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\"\n2For the purposes of this Brief, and consistent with the applicable case law, the\nuse of the word \"prisoner\" will apply to arrestees and pre-trial detainees, as well as\nconvicted inmates. See, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979) (applying the\nCourt's analysis to pretrial detainees as well as convicted prisoners). Further, the use\nof the words \"prison\", \"jail\", \"detention facility\" or the equivalent are intended to be\ninterchangeable.

Id__a_t_.824. The Court went on to say that in matters\nsuch as correctional goals and the policies adopted to attain those goals, \"such\nI\nconsiderations are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\nI\ncorrections officials, and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to\nI\nindicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations,\nI courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.\" ld___a_t, 827.\nI\nC. Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.\nI\nThree years later the Supreme Court decided Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners'\nI\nLabor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119 (1977).

Bell v. Wolfish\nI In 1979, the Supreme Court decided the seminal case Bell v. Wol fish, 441 U.S.\n520 (1979). Bell specifically addressed \"the constitutional rights of pretrial detainees\nI\n- those persons who have been charged with a crime but who have not yet been tried\nI\non the charge.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 523. 4 The issues in Bell involved a myriad of\nI\nconditions and practices implemented at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\nI (MCC), a federally operated custodial facility, ld.___A.mong the cornplaints brought\nby the plaintiffs was the institution's practice of conducting body-cavity searches\ni\nafter contact visits, ld___at_,527.\ni\n4Though many commentators and judges addressing this issue have postulated\nI\nthat Bell applied only to violent offenders or felons, it should be noted that the facility\nat issue in Bell included, in addition to pretrial detainees, \"inmates . . . who are\nI serving generally relatively short sentences in a service capacity.., witnesses in\nprotective custody, and persons incarcerated for contempt.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 524.\nI 11\n\nI\nI\nAt the outset, the Court recognized that \"[t]he Government also has legitimate\nI\ninterests that stem from its need to manage the facility in which the individual is\nI\ndetained .... For example, the Govermnent must be able to take steps to maintain\nI security and order at the institution and make certain no weapons or illicit drugs reach\ndetainees.\" ld. at 540. 5 The Court then went on to review the relevant propositions\nI\nof law established by Martinez, Pell and Jones, supra., and reaffirmed the broad\nI\ndeference due to prison administrators in matters of detention policy. Id__a_t. 545-48. 6\nI\nUpholding the constitutionality of the body-cavity searches, the Supreme Court\nI noted that \"[c]orrections officials testified that visual cavity searches were necessary\nnot only to discover but also to deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other\nI\ncontraband into the institution.\" ld___at__5,58. The Court went on to say:\nI\nAdmittedly, this practice instinctively.gives us the most pause.\nHowever, assuming for present purposes that inmates, both convicted\nI\nprisoners and pretrial detainees, retain some Fourth Amendment rights\nupon commitment to a corrections facility, we nonetheless conclude that\nI these searches do not violate that Amendment. The Fourth Amendment\nI\nSThe Bell Court, citing Martinez., Pell and Jones, noted that courts should defer\nto the expertise of corrections officials in determining whether particular restrictions\nI or conditions are reasonably related to the Government's interest in maintaining\nsecurity and order and operating the institution in a manageable fashion. Bell., 441\nU.S. at 540, n. 23.\nI\n61n fact, the Court chided the 2\"dCircuit Court of Appeals for failing to \"heed\nI its own admonition not to 'second-guess' prison administrators.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at\n545.\nI 12\n\nI\nI\nprohibits only unreasonable searches, and under the circumstances, we\ndo not believe that these searches are unreasonable.\n!\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not\nI\ncapable of precise defnition or mechanical application. In each case it\nrequires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the\nI invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider\nthe scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is\nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nI\nconducted. A detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious\nsecurity dangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other\nI contraband is all too common an occurrence. And inmate attempts to\nsecrete these items into the facility by concealing them in body cavities\nare documented in this record, and in other cases ....\nI\nWe do not underestimate the degree to which these searches may\nI invade the personal privacy ofimnates. Nor do we doubt, as the District\nCourt noted, that on occasion a security guard may conduct the search\nin an abusive fashion. Such abuse cannot be condoned. The searches\nI\nmust be conducted in a reasonable manner. But we deal here with the\nquestion of whether visual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by\nI the MCC rules can ever be conducted on less than probable cause.\nBalancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the\ninstitution against the privacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that\nI\nthey can.\nI Bel__ll,441 U.S. at 558-60 (internal citations omitted).\nAs is evident, the Court used standard Fourth Amendment analysis and applied\nI\na balancing test, in which it considered the \"scope of the particular intrusion, the\nI\nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in\nI\nwhich it is conducted.\" Id__a_t_.559. This \"balancing test\" examination resulted in the\nI\nCourt's conclusion that blanket strip searches can be conducted on less than probable\nI 13\nI\n\nI\nI\ncause. Bel___!4,41 U.S. at 560. It should be noted that the Bell Court upheld strip\nI\nsearches conducted every time a pretrial detainee participated in a contact visit,\nI\nirrespective of who the detainee was or the crime for which he or she was being\ndetained.\nI\nI\n1. A \"balancing test\" analysis under Bell v. Wolfish.\nI\nJail detainees may constitutionally be subject to strip searches after contact\nI\nvisits 7and court appearances. The common thread, and discernable security concern,\nI is that in these instances the detainee has had physical access to and contact with the\n\"outside world.\" Such contact presents the opportunity for contraband to be\nI\nintroduced into the general jail population, where it may result in physical harm to the\nI\ndetainees or the jail personnel. Likewise, any pre-trial detainee who has just been\nI\narrested and \"booked\" has been brought to the jail from the \"outside world\" and,\nI presumably, has been under no supervision prior to arrest and detainment, as opposed\nto a detainee who has merely been afforded a contact visit or has attended a court\nI\nappearance and has presumably been under corrective supervision. Indeed, the\nI\nI\n_Bell v. Wolfish, supra; Arruda v. Fair, 7!0 F.2d 886 (1 s,Cir. 1983) (upholding\nthe constitutionality of subjecting inmates to strip search after they receive visitors);\nGoff v. Nix, 803 F.2d 358 (8 thCir. 1986) (upholding strip searches of inmates after\nI\ncontact visits).\nI 14\n\nI\nI\ncontact visits in Bell took place under observation, and the Court recognized that it\nI\nwould be extremely hard for a detainee to conceal contraband or weapons under those\nI\nconditions) Therefore, logically, the potential for a new arrestee to have obtained\nI and secreted illicit contraband is immeasurably greater than that of an incarcerated\nprisoner. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 546, n. 28 (\"Indeed, it may be that in\nI\ncertain circumstances [pretrial detainees] present a greater risk to jail security and\nI\norder\"); Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 587 (1984) (\"It is not unreasonable to\nI\nassume . . . that low security risk detainees would be enlisted to help obtain\nI contraband or weapons by their fellow inmates\").\nObviously, every pre-trial detainee does not require a strip search. A detainee\nI\nwho is being kept in a \"holding cell\" awaiting bail, and who will have no contact with\nI\nthe general jail population, poses little threat, and a strip search is probably not\nI\njustified absent additional circumstances which would satisfy the \"reasonable\nI suspicion\" test. However, a detainee who will be introduced into the general jail\npopulation is a different problem, in that contact and interaction with the general jail\nI\npopulation is per se an exceptional circumstance which should justify a strip search.\nI\nI\n8\"Detainees and their visitors are in full view during all visits, and are fully\nclad. To insert contraband in one's private body cavities during such a visit would\nI indeed be 'all imposing challenge to nerves and agility.'\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 504 (J.\nStevens, dissenting).\nI 15\n\nI\nI\nSee Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1087 (6thCir. 1983) (upholding a strip search\nI\nwhere a pretrial detainee would ultimately colne into contact with the general jail\nI\npopulation); Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson (;ounty, Kentucky_, 823 F.2d 955 (1987)\nI (upholding a strip search where detainee was not strip searched until his movement\ninto the general population of the jail was imminent); compare Logan v. Shealy, 660\nI\nF.2d 1007, 1014 (4'h Cir. 1981) (stating that unconstitutional strip search bore no\nI\ndiscernible relationship to security needs at the jail in that, inter alia, \"[a]t no time\nI\nwould [the plaintiff] or similar detainees be intermingled with the general jail\nI population\"); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d I, 8 (I _'Cir. 1997) (\"There was no risk that\n[the detainee] would come into contact with other prisoners, or be able to smuggle\nI\ncontraband or weapons into a secure environment\"); Savard v.

Turner v. Safley\nI\nFinally, eight years later the Supreme Court decided Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.\nI\n78 (1987). Turner is another seminal case which addressed inmate constitutional\nI\nI 16\nI\n\nI\nI\nissues unrelated to strip searches. 9 Nonetheless, the Turner Court relied heavily on\nI\nthe analysis set forth above, including lengthy analysis of the tbregoing case law.\nI\nTile Court summed up its review of the law as follows:\nI If Pel[, Jones, and Bell have not already resolved the question\nposed in Martinez, we resolve it now: when a prison regulation impinges\non inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is\nI\nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests. In our view, such\na standard is necessary if\"prison administrators..., and not the courts,\nI [are] to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional\noperations.\" Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union. 433 U.S. at\n128. Subjecting tile day-to-day judgments of prison officials to an\nI\ninflexible strict scrutiny analysis would seriously hamper their ability to\nanticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the\nI intractable problems of prison administration. The rule would also\ndistort the decisionmaking process, for every administrative judgment\nwould be subject to the possibility that some court somewhere would\nI\nconclude that it had a less restrictive way of solving the problem at\nhand. Courts inevitably would become the primary arbiters of what\nI constitutes the best solution to every administrative problem, thereby\n\"unnecessarily perpetuat[ing] tile involvement of the federal courts in\naffairs of prison administration.\" Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. at\nl\n407.\nI Turne____r4,82 U.S. 78 at 89.\n]nmaediately following that restatement of the law, the Supreme Court went on\nI\nto discuss four considerations, drawn from previous case law, which it believed are\nI\n9This Court has cited Turner in the context of strip searches in Harris v.\nI\nOstrout, 63 F.3d 912, 916 (11 '_ Cir. 1995) (\"Thus, if Collins' strip searches of\nAppellant are devoid of penological merit and imposed simply to inflict pain, the\nI federal courts should intervene.

Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974).\nI 11Pell v.

Amicus Curiae submits that it can.\nI\nI\n1. There is a valid, rational connection between the disputed\npolicy and the legitimate governmental interest of preventing\nI of contraband into the general population of the facility.\nDetention facilities place detainees and prison personnel alike in \"peculiar and\nI\nrestrictive circumstances.\" Jones, 433 U.S. at 124. Prison administrators are\nI\nresponsible: for maintaining internal order and discipline of such institutions and for\nI\nsecuring th._ safety, security and, to the extent possible given realistic constraints, the\nL\nI rehabilitation of the inmates committed to it. It cannot be disputed that, with a view\ntoward accomplishing those goals, a detention facility has a legitimate penological\nI\ninterest in preventing the introduction of weapons, drugs, money, and other\nI\ncontraband _3into the general inmate population. Such paraphernalia can present a\nI\ndanger to inmates, guards, staffand visitors, can result in discipline problems, and\nI\ncan inhibit the rehabilitation of detainees (particularly with regards to drug use).\nFurther, the increasing number of detainees being introduced into ihe penal system,\nI\ncoupled with ever-shrinking monetary and other resources, presents a serious strain\nI\non the means and methods available to law enforcement officers to accomplish these\nI\n13\"[O]ther potentially dangerous items such as handcuff keys are sometimes\nI manufactured from materials already within the prison.\" Goffv. Nix, 803 F.2d 358,\n365 (8 'h Cir. 1986).\nI 19\n\nI\n!\ngoals. The use of a strip search, though intrusive, is both exceptionally effective and\nI\ndirectly related to the goal of keeping the general jail population free from dangerous\nI\nand/or disruptive paraphernalia.\nI\n2. There are no alternative means of exercising the right to\nI\nprivacy that is implicated by the disputed policy.\nI Unfortunately, a strip search necessarily and pointedly infringes on an inmate's\nconstitutional right to privacy, and there is no reasonable way for the detainee to\nI\nmitigate this infringement. The point of a strip search is to search the subject's\nI\nprivate areas for contraband and illicit material; any alternative to this invasion would\nI\nrender the policy pointless and decidedly unconstitutional as purely punitive._4 Tile\nI\nintrusion of an individual inmate, though highly personal, is substantially outweighed\nby the institutional interest in protecting its staff, guards, and the prison population\nI\nat large. It should be noted here that the policy at issue goes no farther than is\nI\nnecessary to accomplish its stated goals; i.e. the policy does not call for a manual\nI\nbody cavity search. Further, there is no evidence in any of the relevant and\nI\ncontrolling case law, or in the testimony in the case at bar, that the benefits of this\nI\n14\"Where an arrestee is wearing blue jeans or another heavy material, even the\nmost thorough patdown search will not necessarily turn up small items such as several\nI hits of LSD on postage stamps, a small rock of crack cocaine, or a razor blade.\"\nKraushaar v. Flanigan, 45 F.3d 1040, 1046 (7 'h Cir. 1995).\nI 20\n\nI\nI\ntype of blanket policy have been exaggerated by corrections officials, and tile\nI\njudgment of such officials demands judicial deference.\nI\nI 3. Accommodation of the detainee's right to privacy would have\na significant negative impact on the facility's guards, staff,\nvisitors and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison\nI\nresources generally.\nI As noted above, the purpose of the strip search policy is to prevent the\nintroduction of weapons, drugs, money and other illicit material into the general jail\nI\npopulation. By virtue of this goal, and the nature of the strip search itself, the only\nI\npossible accommodation would be to fail to perform the strip search altogether.\nI\nHowever, this \"accommodation\" would defeat the goal of the policy, which is to\nI\nmaintain the safety and order of the facility. It is clear, and readily acknowledged by\nthe Supreme Court, that \"inmate attempts to secrete [contraband] into [detention\nI\nfacilities] by concealing them in body cavities are [well] documented.\" Bell, 441 U.S.\nI\nat 559.\nI\nAlternative methods of search and detection, such as metal detectors, are\nI\ninherently incapable of revealing the myriad of objects and materials which a visual\nsearch would turn up. Not all weapons are made of metal, and certainly paper money,\nI\ndrugs, stamps, cigarettes, and a host of other materials could pass through such a\nI\nI 21\n\nI\nI\ndevice undetected. Ultraviolet and infrared detection devices are similarly unreliable.\ni Further, said devices are costly, and requiring their purchase would further strain the\nI\nresources of an already under-funded industry.\nI\n4. The absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the\nI\nreasonableness of the disputed policy.\nI From analysis of the previous three factors, it is apparent that no reasonable\nalternative to a strip search exists which would accomplish the proper and legitimate\nI\ngoals of a detention facility. Such absence of an alternative, according to the Turner\nI\nCourt, is evidence of the reasonableness of the policy in dispute. Is\nI\nIt is apparent from the foregoing Supreme Court case law, spanning a period\nI\nof thirteen years and remaining binding precedent today, that a blanket strip search\npolicy applied to arrestees and pretrial detainees who will come into contact with the\nI\ndetention facility's general population can be reasonable, and therefore constitutional,\nI\nlack of reasonable suspicion notwithstanding.\nI\nI\nI\n15It should be noted, however, that \"[g]overnmental action does not have to be\nI the only alternative or even the best alternative for it to be reasonable, to say nothing\nof constitutional.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 542, n. 25.\nI 22\nI\n\nI\nI\nI1. A Review Of Relevant, Controlling Case Law Reveals That Appellant\nI Could Have Reasonably Believed That The Challenged Strip Search Was\nConstitutional, And Therefore Appellant Is Entitled To Qualified\nImmunity.\nI\nA defendant's defensive claim of qualified immunity requires that a court\nI\nbalance the need to defend constitutional rights against the need to insulate public\nI\nofficials fiom civil litigation that might unduly inhibit the studious performance of\nI their duties. See, Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987). In balancing\nthose competing needs, the court must employ a three-part algorithm. The threshold\nI\nquestion is whether the plaintiffhas established a constitutional violation.\nI\nPelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 736 (2002); Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001). The\nI\nsecond question deals with fair warning: it asks whether the law was clearly\nI\nestablished at the time of the constitutional violation. Hop_e_, 536 U.S. at 739-41;\nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 638-40. The final question is whether a reasonable official,\nI\nsituated similarly to the defendant, would have understood that the conduct at issue\nI\ncontravened the clearly established law. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.\nI\nIn the case sub judice, the first part of the aforementioned algorithm is\nI\nextensively addressed in Part 1 of this Brief. In short, Amicus Curiae argues that\nthough strip searches are intrusive and degrading, the searches conducted in the case\nI\nat bar, pursuant to a policy of strip searching arrestees and pretrial detainees who will\nI\nI 23\n\nI\nI\ncome into contact with the general prison population, are constitutional. However,\nI\nshould this Court find otherwise, the questions then remain whether a) the law was\nI\nclearly esiablished, prior to January 21, 1999, that apolice officer needed at least\nI reasonable suspicion before subjecting an arrestee to strip searches prior to\nintroducing him into the general population of the jail, and b) whether a reasonable\nI\npolice officer, situated similarly to the Appellant, would have understood at that time\nI\nthat the policy in place at the jail offended the Constitution. The Appellees cannot\nI\nprevail unless this Court determines both questions favorably as to them.\nI The fundamental justification for the qualified immunity defense is that public\nofficials performing discretionary functions should be free to act without fear of\nI\nlitigation except when they fairly can expect that their conduct will give rise to\nI\nliability for damages. Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183,195 (1984). That expectation\nI\ndepends, in large part, on the extent to which legal rules are clearly established.\nI Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). The inquiry, then, must focus on the\nascertainable contours of the law at the time of the official's actions. Though it is not\nI\nnecessary that those contours be precisely \"on point,\" they must nevertheless be\nI\ndistinctive enough that a reasonable official can be expected to extrapolate from them\nI\nand deduce that a certain course of conduct will transgress the law. Saucier, 533 U.S.\nI\nat 201-02. If the operative legal principles are clearly established only at a level of\nI 24\n\ngenerality so high that officials cannot fairly anticipate the legal consequences of his\nI\nspecific actions, the requisite notice is lacking. Savard v. Pdlode Island, 338 F.3d 23,\nI\n28 (1 _' Cir. 2003). In short, the qualified immunity defense prevails unless the\nt\nI unlawfulness of the challenged conduct is \"apparent.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640.\nIt is axiomatic that decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the Eleventh\nI\nCircuit Court of Appeals, or the highest court of the state where the case arose, are\nI\nthe only legitimate sources from which clearly established law can be inferred for\nI\npurposes of qualified immunity. Marsh v. Butler County, 268 F.3d 1014, 1032, n. 10\nI (2001); Wilson v. Strong, 16 F.3d 113 I, I 135 (1998). With that in mind, we examine\nthe two relevant and controlling decisions that bear most closely on this case.\nI\nWe start with Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). As noted above, the\nI\nplaintiffs in Wolfish were challenging, inter alia, the blanket policy of a detention\nI\nfacility that strip searched detainees after every contact visit. The United States\nI Supreme Court declared the strip search policy constitutional.\nA detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security\nI\ndangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband\nis all too common an occurrence. And inmate attempts to secrete these\nI\nitems into the facility by concealing them in body cavities are\ndocumented in this record, and in odler cases .... [W]e deal here with\nthe question of whether visual body-cavity inspections.., can ever be\nI\nconducted on less than probable cause. Balancing the significant and\nlegitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy\nI interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.\n25\n\nI\nI\nBel.___4_4!l1, U.S. at 558-60 (internal citations omitted).\nI\nAmicus Curiae argues that Bell clearly established the law in this case.\nI\nHowever, even if such a statement is an oversimplification, it is evident that Bell\nI would give a police officer such as the Appellant in this case clear reason to believe\nthat his conduct and actions were constitutional.\nI\nThis brings us to our second case, Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d\nI\n188 (11 th Cir. 1992). There, this Court upheld the strip search of a juvenile based\nI\nupon reasonable suspicion that the juvenile was concealing a weapon or contraband,\nI even where the juvenile was in custody after being arrested for an offense that was\nnot a felony. _Justice, 961 F.2d at 189. The Court reasoned that because the officers\nI\nbelieved they had a reasonable suspicion, in light of their training and experience, that\nI\nthe juvenile was hiding contraband on her person, the search did not violate the\nI\nFourth Amendment. Id___a.t 194.\nI Again, as in Bell, the Justic__geCourt found the strip search constitutional.\nConsequently, the only two binding precedents available at the time the Appellant\nm\nhad to make a decision regarding the strip search of the Appellees both found strip\nI\nsearches constitutional. It stretches the imagination to conclude that a reasonable law\nI\nenforcement official would have had fair warning that the strip search of Appellees\n,1\nwould be found unconstitutional. The constitutional line that separates penaaissible\nI 26\n\nI\nI\nfrom impermissible uses of these methods is imprecise and context-specific. Plotting\nI\nthat line involves a complex analysis, as set forth in Part I, above. The law does not\nI\nexpect a public official, faced with the need to make an objectively reasonable real-\nI world judgment, to squarely anticipate the legal conclusions that will be reached by\na panel of federal appellate judges after briefing, arguments, and full-fledged, en banc\nI\nreview. See Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999). Further, to the degree that\nI\nthe facts in these two controlling cases are distinguishable in a fair way from the facts\nI\nin the case at bar, then neither of them can be said to have clearly established the law\nI for purposes of a qualified immunity determination in the instant case. Saucier, 533\nU.S. at 202-03.\nI\nThere is a distinction, for qualified immunity purposes, between an\nI\nunconstitutional but objectively reasonable act and a blatantly unconstitutional act.\nI\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 206. Here, the constitutional violation, if one existed at all, was\nI not obvious; the Appellant could have reasonably thought, based on the relevant\ncontrolling case law, that there was room in the law for the blanket strip search\nI\npolicy. It is the absence of clear guidance that makes qualified immunity expedient.\nI\nIt would be unfair to hold a public official liable for doing nothing more blameworthy\nI\nthan guessing incorrectly about how the courts ultimately would resolve an issue.\nWilson, 526 U.S. at 618. The law does not require public officials to foretell the\ni\nI 27\nI\n\nI\nI\ncourse of constitutional law with absolute accuracy in order to obtain qualified\ni\nimmunity, ld__a_t, 617. To the contrary, the doctrine of qualified immunity is designed\nI\nto protect \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"\nI Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335,341 (1986).\ni\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI 28\nI\n\nf\nI\nI\nCONCLUSION\nI\nA review of the relevant authoritative and precedential case law conclusively\nI ;\ndemonstrates the constitutionality of a blanket policy requiring arrestees who are to\nI be detained in the general jail population to be subjected to a strip search, without\nprerequisite reasonable suspicion that the search will reveal weapons and contraband.\nI\nUnder the Bell balancing test, the introduction of a detainee into the general jail\nI\npopulation is pet\" se exceptional circumstances which should justify a strip search, in\nI\nthat such contact presents the opportunity for contraband to be introduced into the\nI general jail population, where it may result in physical harm to the detainees or the\njail personnel. Further, under the four-part Turner algoritl'un, such a policy is still\nI\nconstitutionally valid, in that: 1) A detention thcility has a legitimate penological\nI\ninterest in preventing the introduction of weapons, drugs, money, and other\nI\ncontraband into the general inmate population, and the use of a strip search is both\nI\nexceptionally effective and directly related to the goal of keeping the general jail\npopulation free from such dangerous and/or disruptive paraphernalia; 2) There is no\nI\nreasonable way for the to mitigate the infringement on a detainee's right to privacy\nI\ninherent in a strip search, however the intrusion is substantially outweighed by the\nI\ninstitutional interest in protecting its staff, guards, and the prison population at large;\nI\n3) Any accommodation of the inmate's right to privacy, e.g. failure to perform the\nI 29\n\nI\nI\nstrip search altogether, would defeat the goal of the policy of maintaining the safety\nI\nand order of the facility; 4) Alternative methods of search and detection, such as\nI\nmetal detectors, are inherently incapable of revealing the myriad of objects and\nI materials which a visual search would turn up, and are prohibitively costly; and 5) It\nis apparent that no reasonable alternative to a strip search exists which would\nI\naccomplish the proper and legitimate goals of a detention facility.\nI\nShould this Court find the aforementioned blanket policy unconstitutional, the\nI\nquestions then remain, for qualified immunity purposes, whether a) the law was\nI clearly established, prior to January 21, 1999, that a police officer needed at least\nreasonable suspicion before subjecting an arrestee to strip searches prior to\nI\nintroducing him into the general population of the jail, and b) whether a reasonable\nI\npolice officer, situated similaHy to the Appellant, would have understood at that time\nI\nthat the policy in place at the jail offended the Constitution.\nI The only two binding precedents available on January 21, 1999, Bell v.\nWolfish and Justice v. City of Peachtree City, both found strip searches\nI\nconstitutional. Therefore, the Appellant could have reasonably thought, based on the\nI\nrelevant controlling case law, that there was room in the law for the blanket strip\nI\nsearch policy. To the degree that the facts in these two controlling cases are\nI\ndistinguishable in a fair way from the facts in the case at bar, then neither of them can\nI 30\n\nI\nI\nbe said to have clearly established tile law for purposes of a qualified immunity\nI\ndetermination in the instant case.\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n31\n\nI\nI\nWHEREFORE, ABOVE PREMISES CONSIDERED, Amicus Curiae, the\nI\nAlabama Municipal Insurance Corporation and Alabama League of Municipalities,\nI\nprays that this Honorable Court:\nI 1. Find that a blanket policy, requiring arrestees who are to be detained in\nthe general jail population to be subjected to a strip search without\nI\nprerequisite reasonable suspicion that the search will reveal weapons\nI\nand contraband, is constitutional: or, alternatively,\nI\n2. Find that, even if such a policy is unconstitutional, due to the lack of\nI clearly established law on the issue, Appellant is entitled to immunity\nfrom suit and liability under the doctrine of qualified immunity.\nI\nRespectfully submitted,\nI\nI\n_ ___.__\nThomas S.
