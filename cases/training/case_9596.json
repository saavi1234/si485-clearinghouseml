City and County of San Francisco</a> (N.D. Cal.), a class action case challenging the strip search policy of the City and County of San Francisco. Flick filed her case on September 3, 2003, represented by attorneys C. Schwartz and Mark E. Merin, who were also class counsel in the Bull case.</p>\r\n<p>Flick alleged that she was subjected to false arrest by several San Francisco police officers, purportedly for the charge of public intoxication. Plaintiff alleged that she was transported to the County Jail, where she was forcibly striped naked and thrown into a \"cold room.\" She remained naked in the cold room, until she was released the next morning. No citation or any criminal charges were ever filed against her. Plaintiff alleged violations of her rights secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and California state law. She sought general, special, exemplary, and statutory damages, as well as attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>On November 6, 2003, the Court (Judge Charles R. Breyer) issued an order relating the case with <a href=\"../../../../case/38/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bull v. City and County of San Francisco</a> (N.D. Cal.), a class action case challenging San Francisco's strip search. Bull was filed by the same attorneys who represent Plaintiff.</p>\r\n<p>On November 21, 2003, Plaintiff amended her complaint to include additional claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, negligence, violations of her rights under California law, as well as false arrest, detention, and imprisonment.</p>\r\n<p>On March 18, 2011, the Court stayed this matter pending the resolution of the Bull case after establishing Plaintiff's membership in Bull's plaintiff class. Two years later, the parties in the Bull case settled and the case was dismissed. On September 30, 2013, after the Bull case was dismissed, the parties in this case reached a settlement and the Court dismissed this case, though the details of the settlement were not provided.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

These  defendants  seized, \n6  arrested, transported, detained and imprisoned Plaintiff on March 28, 2003 without any \n7  reasonable cause or suspicion that she had committed any felony and without having \n8  observed the commission of any misdemeanor or infraction.

Plaintiff sues these individuals in their individual capacity. \n3  9.  Defendant City And County Of San Francisco is, and at all material times \n4  referred to herein, was, a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted \n5  an official policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types \n6  of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged Plaintiffs as herein alleged.  \n7  Plaintiffs’ allegations against the City and County are based on acts and omissions of \n8  the Acting Chief of Police and his police officers and on the acts and omissions of the \n9  Sheriff and his deputies and on acts and omissions of persons who are City and/or \n10  County employees, and on the City and County’s breach of its duty to protect Plaintiff \n11  from  the  wrongful  conduct  of  said  persons  and  employees.

Shortly  after  midnight  on  March  28,  2003, Plaintiff Deborah Flick was \n4  standing  near  the  intersection  of  Fillmore  and  Union  Streets  in  the  City  of  San \n5  Francisco, California.   \n6  12.  As Flick was walking to her car that was parked on the street, a man \n7  began to harass her.  She ignored him and continued to her car.  The unknown man \n8  then yelled that if she did not stop to talk to him, he would call the police and claim Flick \n9  was driving while intoxicated.  Flick ignored him, knowing she was not intoxicated.  Flick \n10  got into her car and attempted to call her boyfriend from her cell phone to let him know \n11  she was heading home. \n12  13.  Suddenly,  San  Francisco  Police  Officers  Nelson  and  Griffin  began \n13  pounding on the window of  Plaintiff’s car.  She rolled the window down slightly and \n14  asked what was wrong.  She explained that a  man had been harassing her, that she \n15  had done nothing wrong, that she was fine, and they should be speaking with the man \n16  who had harassed her.   \n17  14.  The officers pounded on her window yelling “you think that because you’re \n18  pretty and a rich bitch, you can do whatever you want.”  At some point these officers \n19  were joined by Officer R.L. Lock and O’Sullivan.  Plaintiff became frightened and dialed \n20  911 because she was alarmed by the officers’ conduct.    \n21  15.  Officers Nelson and Griffin, assisted by Officer R.L. Lock and Sergeant \n22  O’Sullivan,  then  yanked  Plaintiff’s  car  door  open,  dragged  her  into  the  street  and \n23  handcuffed her.  After  Plaintiff complained, the officers tightened the handcuffs, and \n24  threw Plaintiff into the police car.  Plaintiff was so frightened she urinated in her pants.  \n25  16.  Although lacking any reasonable cause to detain or arrest Plaintiff, police \n26  officers, Nelson, Griffin, R.L. Lock, Sergeant O’Sullivan and Does 1-35 transported her \n27  to San Francisco County Jail No. 9.   \n28 \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N. California Blvd.,  Flick v.

Plaintiff  eventually  was  advised  that  she  had  been  arrested  for  public \n2  intoxication, but no officer or deputy administered a sobriety test.   \n3  18.  No citation or any criminal charges were filed against Plaintiff.  \n4  19.  Neither  Acting  Police  Chief  Fagan  nor  other  superiors  of  those  San \n5  Francisco Police Officers  Nelson, Griffin, R.L.

Sheriff’s deputies and/or other jail personnel were aware that Plaintiff had \n18 \nnot committed any crime punishable as a felony. \n19 \n23.  Sheriff’s deputies and/or jail personnel threw Plaintiff into the “cold room” \n20 \nin the San Francisco County Jail and left her there naked. \n21 \n24.  Male and female sheriff’s deputies and other jail personnel were able to \n22 \nlook into the room and did in fact look into the “cold room” and saw her naked. \n23 \n25.  Those  actions  permitted  sheriff’s  deputies  and  other  jail  personnel  to \n24 \nvisually inspect Plaintiff’s breasts, buttocks, and genitalia. \n25 \n26.

Defendant Hennessey also approved a training regimen which instructed \n4  subordinate sheriff’s deputies and/or jail personnel that those detained may be placed in \n5  a “cold room” even when such detainees posed no threat to themselves or to others.  \n6  63.  Prior  to  March  28,  2003,  long-established  statutory  law,  California \n7  regulations  and  controlling  court  decisions  had  forbidden  both  such  stripping  of \n8  detainees and the placing of detainees in a “cold room.”  \n9  64.

Plaintiff  realleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  of \n5  paragraphs 1 through 67 as if they were set forth in haec verba herein. \n6  69.  Prior to March 28, 2003, the City and County of San Francisco was well \n7  aware that absent proper training of police officers, individuals in the City and County of \n8  San Francisco would be subject to unreasonable search, seizure, arrest, transportation, \n9  detention and imprisonment.  In failing to train those individuals, the City and County of \n10  San  Francisco  was  deliberately  indifferent  to  the  constitutional  rights  of  Plaintiff \n11  guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United Sates Constitution. \n12  70.   Prior to March 28, 2003, the City and County of San Francisco was well \n13  aware that absent proper training of sheriff’s deputies and jail personnel, individuals in \n14  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  would  be  subject  to  being  stripped  of  their \n15  clothing and placed naked in and confined while naked in “cold rooms” at San Francisco \n16  County Jail facilities without any proper basis for such punishment in violation of the \n17  Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  In failing to train \n18  those individuals, the City and County of San Francisco was deliberately indifferent to \n19  the  constitutional  rights  of  Plaintiff  guaranteed  by  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \n20  Amendments to the United Sates Constitution. \n21  71.  The  conduct  of  the  individual  defendants  sued  Does  1  through  200 \n22  occurred due to the failure of the San Francisco Police Department and San Francisco \n23  Sheriff’s Department to properly train their employees in the following areas:  (1) the \n24  reasonable cause which must exist prior to the  search, seizure, arrest, transportation \n25  and  detention  of  an  individual; (2) the documentation which must exist to verify the \n26  existence  of  the  reasonable  cause  to  justify  the  search,  seizure,  detention, \n27  transportation and arrest of an individual; (3) the justification which must exist prior to \n28  the stripping of the clothes from an individual detained  in a San Francisco County Jail; \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

At all times relevant to the allegations of this complaint, Defendant City \n7  and  County  of  San  Francisco  had  the  policy  of  searching,  seizing,  arresting, \n8  transporting, detaining and imprisoning  individuals without reasonable cause and failing \n9  properly to document such arrests. \n10  73.  At all times relevant to the allegations of this complaint, Defendant City \n11  and  County  of  San  Francisco  had  the  policy  of  authorizing  its  personnel,  including \n12  sheriff’s  deputies  and  other  jail  personnel, without reasonable cause,  to strip those \n13  detained in its jail facilities and to place such individuals naked in “cold rooms” in the jail \n14  facilities, regardless of whether such detainees possessed contraband or weapons or \n15  posed a threat to themselves or others.  \n16  74.  The  conduct  of  Defendant  Michael  Hennessey  in  promulgating  and \n17  ensuring the implementation of the policies pursuant to which Plaintiff was stripped of \n18  her clothing and placed naked in a “cold room” at San Francisco County Jail No. 9 \n19  reflected the policy of the City and County of San Francisco. \n20  75.  The  failure  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  to  reprimand, \n21  suspend, or discipline  those employees of the City and County of  San Francisco (1) \n22  who searched, seized, arrested, transported, detained and imprisoned Plaintiff without \n23  reasonable cause; (2) who failed to document Plaintiff’s arrest and detention; (3) who \n24  stripped Plaintiff without any legal justification and (4) who placed and confined Plaintiff \n25  naked in a “cold room” at San Francisco County Jail No. 9 ratified that misconduct and \n26  reflected City and County policies to (1) arrest individuals without probable cause; (2) to \n27  fail  to  document  such  arrests;  (3)  notwithstanding  any  reasonable  cause,  to  strip \n28  individuals  detained  in  San  Francisco  County  Jail  facilities  although  such  individuals \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Plaintiff  realleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  of \n13 \nparagraphs 1 through 10 as if they were set forth in haec verba herein. \n14 \n78.  On September 3, 2003, Plaintiff submitted a claim to the City and County \n15 \nof  San  Francisco  pursuant  to  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  California  Government \n16 \nCode.  On October 17, 2003, the City and County of San Francisco denied  Plaintiff’s \n17 \nclaim.  \n18 \n79.  Shortly  after  midnight  on  March  28,  2003,  Plaintiff  Deborah Flick was \n19 \nstanding  near  the  intersection  of  Fillmore  and  Union  Streets  in  the  City  of  San \n20 \nFrancisco, California.   \n21 \n80.  As Flick was walking to her car that was parked on the street, a man \n22 \nbegan to harass her.  She ignored him and continued to her car.  The unknown man \n23 \nthen yelled that if she did not stop to talk to him, he would call the police and claim Flick \n24 \nwas driving while intoxicated.  Flick ignored him, knowing she was not intoxicated.  Flick \n25 \ngot into her car and attempted to call her boyfriend from her cell phone to let him know \n26 \nshe was heading home. \n27 \n28 \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Suddenly,  two  male  San  Francisco  Police  Department  officers  began \n2  pounding on the window of Plaintiff’s car.  She rolled the window down slightly and \n3  asked what was wrong.  She explained that a  man had been harassing her, that she \n4  had done nothing wrong, that she was fine, and they should be speaking with the man \n5  who had harassed her.  The officers pounded on her window yelling “you think that \n6  because  you’re  pretty  and  a  rich  bitch,  you  can  do  whatever  you  want.”    Plaintiff \n7  became frightened and dialed 911 because she was alarmed by the officers’ conduct.    \n8  82.  The officers then yanked Plaintiff’s car door open, dragged her into the \n9  street  and  handcuffed  her.    After  Plaintiff  complained,  the  officers  tightened  the \n10  handcuffs,  and  threw  Plaintiff  into  the  police  car.    Plaintiff  was  so  frightened  she \n11  urinated in her pants.  \n12  83.  Although lacking any reasonable cause to detain or arrest Plaintiff, police \n13  officers transported her to San Francisco County Jail No. 9.   \n14  84.  Plaintiff  eventually  was  advised  that  she  had  been  arrested  for  public \n15  intoxication, but no officer or deputy administered a sobriety test.   \n16  85.  Police  officers  neither  prepared  nor  filed  any  report  setting  forth  the \n17  events of Plaintiff’s arrest and/or detention.  \n18  86.  No citation or any criminal charges were filed against Plaintiff.  \n19  87.

Subsequently, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which\n8 seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and punitive damages. \n9 Plaintiffs allege that they were victims of two unconstitutional policies and practices\n10 of the San Francisco County jail system.  First, plaintiffs allege that the County’s policy of\n11 conducting strip searches and body cavity searches1 of arrestees held prior to arraignment\nt\nr\nu 12 without reasonable suspicion that the individual possesses contraband or presents a security\no\nC\n  13 threat violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 well as California law.  Second, plaintiffs allege that the County’s policy of placing pretrial\ns D ct of 15 detainees in “safety cells” as punishment and the blanket policy of strip searching all\nte stri\na Di16 individuals placed in safety cells violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 United States Constitution, as well as California law.\nUnit or the 18 The strip search policy in place at the time of plaintiffs’ arrests and searches permitted\nF\n19 the Sheriff’s Department to conduct a strip search of arrestees charged with a crime\n20 involving drugs, weapons or violence and arrestees with a criminal history involving drugs,\n21 weapons or violence (as well as other categories of arrestees not relevant here).  Arrestees\n22 not in those categories could be strip searched if they signed a form consenting to be strip\n23 searched.  Seaton Decl. Ex. 3-5.  \n24 The safety cell policy in place at the time of plaintiffs’ arrests and searches permitted\n25 arrestees to be placed in safety cells in any of the following situations: \n26\n27 1 The Court recognizes that there is a spectrum of possible search practices alleged in this\naction, including strip searches and visual body cavity searches.  However, for simplicity’s sake, the\n28 Court will use “strip search” in this decision to generally cover all of the alleged conduct unless\notherwise specified.  \n2\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162      Filed 06/10/2004     Page 3 of 20\n1\n1.

Under the policy, any arrestee that is placed in a safety cell, for any\n7 reason, shall be strip searched prior to placement.  Id.\n8 On January 21, 2004, the Sheriff enacted new search and safety cell policies.  Under\n9 the new strip search policy an arrestee may be strip searched at the time of booking only if\n10 “There is articulable reasonable suspicion and supervisor approval on the Strip Search\n11 Authorization Form prior to the strip search”; or the arrestee is charged with a crime of\nt\nr\nu 12 drugs, weapons or violence; or has been convicted or arrested within the last 5 years for\no\nC\n  13 drugs, weapons or violence.

Those placed in safety cells because the person is deemed a\n28 danger to self or at his/her request will be stip searched.

Others placed in\n3 safety cells will only be strip searched if the supervisor approving the placement can\n4 articulate reasonable suspicion that the prisoner has contraband hidden that poses a risk to\n5 prisoners, staff, or self.  Id.\n6 A more detailed recitation of the strip search and safety cell policies that were in place\n7 prior to January 21, 2004 and the new policies are outlined in Appendix A to this Order. \n8 Also on January 21, 2004, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.  On January\n9 22, 2004, defendants filed a cross-complaint seeking declaratory relief in which this Court\n10 would declare that plaintiffs’ case is moot, and that the Sheriff’s new policies regarding\n11 searches and safety cell use comply with state and federal law. \nt\nr\nu 12 II. Procedural Background\no\nC\n  13 Mary Bull, et al. v. City and County of San Francisco, et al., Case No. 03-1840, was\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 filed in this Court on April 23, 2003.  Subsequently, this Court determined that Lazaneo v.\ns D ct of 15 City and County of San Francisco, Case No. 03-46922, Flick v. City and County of San\nte stri\na Di16 Francisco, Case No. 03-4022, and Yourke v. City and County of San Francisco, Case No. 03-\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 3105, are related to Bull.  \nUnit or the 18 The first hearing on the four motions currently before the Court was held on April 9,\nF\n19 2004.  The Court, determining that further oral argument was necessary, also held hearings\n20 on these motions on April 12 and April 13, and then requested supplemental briefing on the\n21 class certification issue.  The motions were then submitted.  \n22 DISCUSSION\n23 I. Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n24 Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin several of\n25 defendants’ policies with respect to strip searches, body cavity searches, and the use of safety\n26 cells.  In particular, plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction that does the following:\n27\n28\n2Lazaneo settled on May 11, 2003.\n4\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162      Filed 06/10/2004     Page 5 of 20\n1 1)  Enjoins pre-arraignment strip searches at any of the San Francisco County\nJails of arrestees charged with crimes not involving drugs, violence or weapons\n2 unless a) there is particularized reasonable suspicion that a search willbe\nproductive of contraband or a weapon, b) the basis for that reasonable\n3 suspicion is recorded in writing and c) the search is approved by a supervisor\nprior to the search being conducted;\n4\n2)  Enjoins pre-arraignment placement into safety cells of arrestees unless there\n5 has been a prior determination by a licensed professional that the arrestee has\ndemonstrated behavior which reveals an intent to cause physical harm to\n6 himself/herself or others;\n7 3)  Enjoins strip searches of persons placed in safety cells;\n8 4)  Enjoins removal of the clothing of persons placed in safety cells unless a\nlicensed professional has determined that the arrestee is likely to use the\n9 clothing to harm himself.\n10 Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of Preliminary Injunction (“Plaintiff’s P.I. Memo.”) at 1.\n11 As stated in open court, this Court denies plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary\nt\nr\nu 12 injunction because plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they will be exposed to a\no\nC\n  13 significant risk of irreparable injury or immediate threatened injury under the new policy\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 enacted by the Sheriff on January 21, 2004.  On a motion for a preliminary injunction, the\ns D ct of 15 Court is looking at whether an extraordinary remedy shall be put in place based on a threat of\nte stri\na Di16 irreparable injury to the plaintiffs.  There must be some imminence involved, otherwise the\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 litigation can proceed through its normal course.  While plaintiffs argue that defendants’\nUnit or the 18 history of ignoring its written policies demonstrates that even though there is a new policy in\nF\n19 place there is a likelihood that defendants will not follow the new policy, the Court does not\n20 agree that there is an immediate threat of harm.  \n21 Given the new policy enacted by defendants, this Court finds no imminent threat of\n22 injury, and concludes that a preliminary injunction is not needed to preserve the status quo\n23 and prevent irreparable loss of rights before judgment.\n24 II. Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n25 Defendants’ cross-complaint seeks an order from this Court declaring that the San\n26 Francisco Sheriff’s Department’s policies entitled “Searches” and “Safety Cell Use,” adopted\n27 January 21, 2004, do not violate the United States Constitution or California state law. \n28 Defendants have moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n5\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162      Filed 06/10/2004     Page 6 of 20\n1 Procedure 12(c) of their cross complaint.  Plaintiffs offer two arguments why this motion\n2 should be denied.  First, they argue that defendants’ cross-complaint is not ripe for\n3 adjudication, thus stripping the Court of jurisdiction over the cross-complaint.  Second, they\n4 argue that the Court should deny the motion because defendants have failed to provide an\n5 adequate factual basis to establish the legality of the new policies.\n6 As stated in open court, the Court agrees with plaintiffs that judgment on the\n7 pleadings is not warranted.  The Court declines to issue an advisory opinion as to the legality\n8 of the new strip search policy.  Additionally, in order to adjudicate this matter, the Court\n9 must consider numerous factual issues, including the scope of the particular intrusion, the\n10 manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\n11 conducted.  The Court is unable to make such factual determination on the pleadings alone;\nt\nr\nu 12 thus, defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is denied. \no\nC\n  13 III. Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 Summary judgment is proper when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to\ns D ct of 15 interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\nte stri\na Di16 no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  An issue is “genuine” only if there is a sufficient\nUnit or the 18 evidentiary basis on which a reasonable fact finder could find for the nonmoving party, and a\nF\n19 dispute is “material” only if it could affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.  See\n20 Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49 (1986).  A principal purpose of the\n21 summary judgment procedure “is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims.” \n22 Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986).  “Where the record taken as a whole\n23 could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no ‘genuine\n24 issue for trial.’”  Matsushita Elec. Ind. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).\n25 There are presently nine named plaintiffs in this suit.  Defendants have moved for\n26 partial summary judgment as follows: (1) on all state and federal stip search claims brought\n27 by plaintiffs Zern, Corneau, Bronson, and Giampaoli (Counts One, Three, and Four); (2) on\n28 //\n6\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162      Filed 06/10/2004     Page 7 of 20\n1 all state law strip search claims by plaintiffs Bull and Timbrook (Counts Three and Four);\n2 and (3) on all claims by plaintiff Johnson (Counts One through Five).  \n3 Plaintiffs do not oppose the grant of partial summary judgment in favor of defendants\n4 and against plaintiffs Bull, Timbrook, and Giampaoli on their claims under California Penal\n5 Code section 4030 (Count Four), nor do they oppose a grant of partial summary judgment in\n6 favor of defendants and against plaintiff Johnson on all claims.  Accordingly, the Court\n7 GRANTS IN PART defendants’ motion as to those issues not opposed by plaintiffs.\n8 The parties continue to dispute defendants’ motion with respect to plaintiff\n9 Giampaoli’s federal and remaining state strip search claims (Counts One and Three),\n10 plaintiffs Zern, Corneau, and Bronson’s state and federal claims (Counts, One, Three, and\n11 Four), and plaintiffs Bull and Timbrook’s remaining state claims (Counts Three and Five).3 \nt\nr\nu 12 As stated in open court, the Court concludes that summary judgment is not appropriate\no\nC\n  13 at this time because there are still numerous material factual, as well as legal, issues that are\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 in dispute.  Accordingly, the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the remaining portions\ns D ct of 15 of defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  Such issues will be addressed in further\nte stri\na Di16 proceedings.  \nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 IV. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\nUnit or the 18 A. Legal Standard for Class Certification\nF\n19 Class certification is governed by Rule 23, which sets forth a two-step procedure. \n20 First, the following four requirements of Rule 23(a) must be satisfied: (1) numerosity, (2)\n21 common questions of law or fact are present, (3) typicality, and (4) adequate representation. \n22 Once those four requirements are met, the plaintiffs must show that the lawsuit qualifies for\n23 class action status under one of the four possibilities found in Rule 23(b).  \n24 Plaintiffs seek to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), which is appropriate where the\n25 court “finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class\n26 predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is\n27\n28 3Defendants have not moved for summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs Mangosing and\nFleming.  \n7\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162      Filed 06/10/2004     Page 8 of 20\n1 superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.”\n2 Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(b)(3).  \n3 Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that certification is appropriate.  See Hawkins v.\n4 Comparet-Cassani, 251 F.3d 1230, 1238 (9th Cir. 2001).  The court must rigorously analyze\n5 whether the class action allegations meet the requirements of Rule 23.  General Telephone\n6 Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982).  “Because the early resolution of\n7 the class certification question requires some degree of speculation, however, all that is\n8 required is that the Court form a ‘reasonable judgment’ on each certification requirement.  In\n9 formulating this judgment, the Court may properly consider both the allegations of the class\n10 action complaint and the supplemental evidentiary submissions of the parties.”  In re Citric\n11 Acid Antitrust Litigation, 1996 WL 655791 *2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 1996).  \nt\nr\nu 12 B.

This class also includes 1) all arrestees who were\nsubjected to subsequent blanket strip search(es) before arraignment after the\n24 initial strip search, without any reasonable individualized suspicion that they\nhad subsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons; and 2) all\n25 persons who, prior to arraignment, were subjected to blanket visual body cavity\nsearch(es) incident to placement in a “safety cell” at any of the San Francisco\n26 County Jails.\n27 Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification at 1. \n28 //\n8\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162      Filed 06/10/2004     Page 9 of 20\n1 Defendants argue that plaintiffs have not met the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule\n2 23(b)(3).  In particular, defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims are not typical of the class\n3 and that the individual fact questions far outnumber the common questions such that the\n4 predominance and superiority elements of Rule 23(b)(3) are not met.  Additionally,\n5 defendants argue that plaintiffs’ state law claims cannot be certified as a class.  \n6 “The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are\n7 sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”  Amchem Products Inc. v.\n8 Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997).  \n9 The crux of defendants argument against class certification is that the issues involved\n10 in this litigation entail detailed individualized determinations.  They argue that the individual\n11 background of the plaintiffs make it difficult to determine whether someone is a member of\nt\nr\nu 12 the class, in addition to the more pressing question of whether that person’s rights have been\no\nC\n  13 violated.  The determination of whether the plaintiffs suffered an illegal strip search involves\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 a determination of whether the institutional strip search policy in place was unlawful. \ns D ct of 15 However, even if the policy is unconstitutional, defendants argue that the individual\nte stri\na Di16 plaintiff’s rights may not have been violated if the search was done based on reasonable\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 suspicion.  Thus, according to defendants, plaintiffs have not met the predominance element\nUnit or the 18 of Rule 23(b)(3) because even if the constitutionality of the institutional policy is the same\nF\n19 for all plaintiffs, whether there was reasonable suspicion for each search will depend on the\n20 individual circumstances involved.  \n21 Defendants argument does not defeat class certification.  The arguments presented by\n22 defendants are virtually the same arguments that were presented by the defendants in Tardiff\n23 v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004), where the First Circuit affirmed the\n24 certification of class actions in similar challenges to county strip search policies.  Tardiff was\n25 a consolidation of two district court cases in which several arrestees brought separate section\n26 1983 suits against two different counties alleging that the policies of conducting routine,\n27 suspicionless strip searches of all pre-arraignment jail detainees was unconstitutional.  Id. at\n28 2.  Both district courts granted the plaintiffs’ motions for class certification.  Id.  On appeal,\n9\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162      Filed 06/10/2004     Page 10 of 20\n1 the First Circuit determined that while some individualized evaluations may be necessary,\n2 overall it could be assumed that the plaintiffs were searched based on the county’s custom or\n3 policy, and any individual questions did not defeat certification.  Id. at 5-6.  Defendants argue\n4 that Tardiff is not applicable to this case because, unlike Tardiff, the nature of the strip\n5 search policy is not at issue here.  The Court disagrees and finds the reasoning in Tardiff to\n6 be persuasive.\n7 Similar to Tardiff, what really is at issue here is the constitutionality of the policies\n8 and practices of the Sheriff’s Department, which were applied to all class members.  While\n9 the “nature” of the department’s policy and practices is not at issue, the legality of those\n10 policy and practices is.  The common legal question presented by the members of the\n11 proposed class of whether the Sheriff’s strip search policy is unconstitutional predominates\nt\nr\nu 12 this action, and the allegations of the named plaintiffs closely track the claims of the class\no\nC\n  13 and share a common legal theory.  Given the alleged uniform and indiscriminate nature of the\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 strip search policy and practice at issue, including the practice of strip searching all those\ns D ct of 15 placed in safety cells, it appears that liability can be determined on a class-wide rather than\nte stri\na Di16 an individual basis. \nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 However, the Court agrees with defendants that the class definition must specifically\nUnit or the 18 exclude all persons arrested on a charge of violence, regardless of whether it is a felony or\nF\n19 misdemeanor charge of violence.  The class definition should be amended accordingly.  \n20 As such, the class definition itself will address some of defendants’ concerns because\n21 it does not include those plaintiffs arrested on charges involving weapons, controlled\n22 substances, or a felony charge of violence.  As the Tardiff court noted, the legality of the\n23 strip search policy presents complicated issues because it might be lawful as to some groups\n24 of arrestees and not others, but that issue is somewhat addressed by limiting the class\n25 definition to certain arrestees.  365 F.3d at 5.  Moreover, although it may still be determined\n26 that it was permissible to strip search some within the group of arrestees that remain in the\n27 class, that determination presents a common set of issues that is proper for resolution on a\n28 class-wide basis.  Id.    \n10\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162      Filed 06/10/2004     Page 11 of 20\n1 The class includes only those subjected to a blanket visual body cavity strip search\n2 without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband. \n3 Thus, those that were subjected to searches based on individualized reasonable suspicion are\n4 not included in the class.  The issue of whether a post hoc determination of reasonable\n5 suspicion is sufficient to avoid a constitutional violation will not be addressed at this time. \n6 Nonetheless, even if there is a post hoc determination of reasonable suspicion, that does not\n7 mean that an individual was not searched pursuant to a blanket visual body cavity strip\n8 search, the constitutionality of which will be determined in this litigation.   \n9 As stated in Tardiff:\n10\nWithout prejudging disputable issues, we think that such threats of undue\n11 complications as to liability are limited in this case.  If there was in fact a rule, custom\nt or policy of strip searching every arrestee or a substantially overlarge category, then it\nr\nu 12 is a fair guess that most arrestees so classed were strip searched on this basis.  There\no\nC might yet be some number as to who defensible individual judgments to strip search\n  13 were actually made or could have been made--two different situations with different\nt\nic nia legal implications; but whoever has the burden of identifying such person, they may\nistr Califor14 well not be numerous.  \ns D ct of 15 Id. at 6.  \nte stri\na Di16 The situation in this case is even more appropriate for class certification because\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 defendants acknowledge that there was a rule, custom, or policy in place regarding strip\nUnit or the 18 searches, and it is this policy that plaintiffs challenge.  Thus, it is a fair guess that most\nF\n19 arrestees were searched on that basis.  Nonetheless, this Court agrees with the reasoning of\n20 the Tardiff court that any potential individualized issues can be addressed later in the\n21 litigation and do not defeat class certification. \n22 This Court also agrees with the Tardiff court that the “individualized damage\n23 decisions [do] not ordinarily defeat predominance where there are still disputed common\n24 issues as to liability.”  Id.  \n25 There are still numerous questions that need to be resolved, such as whether it is\n26 constitutional to have a blanket policy that allows the Sheriff’s Department to search all\n27 those charged with crimes of violence to visual body cavity searches; how to define crimes of\n28 violence that would warrant such searches; and whether it is constitutional to have a blanket\n11\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162      Filed 06/10/2004     Page 12 of 20\n1 policy to search all those placed in safety cells.  Regardless, whatever is decided on those\n2 issues, would seemingly affect all class members.\n3 As to superiority, at this stage it is apparent that the resolution of the liability and\n4 damages issues within the context of a class action is likely to be a far more efficient method\n5 of adjudication than the individual assertion of lawsuits grounded on similar sets of facts.   \n6 Based on the information that is currently before the Court, the Court finds that\n7 individualized issues will arise only in a limited number of cases.  Accordingly, the Court\n8 concludes that all of the requirements of Rule 23 have been met and certification of a class is\n9 warranted.  \n10 Importantly, however, “Determinations to certify a class depend on initial predication\n11 and are always subject to revision.”  Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 6 (citing General Telephone Co.,\nt\nr\nu 12 457 U.S. at 160).  This Court can always decertify the class should that become necessary.  \no\nC\n  13 CONCLUSION\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby DENIES plaintiffs’ motion for a\ns D ct of 15 preliminary injunction, DENIES defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings,\nte stri\na Di16 GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN PART defendants’ motion\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 for partial summary judgment, and GRANTS plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.\nUnit or the 18 Accordingly, the Court certifies the following class:\nF\n19 All persons who, during the applicable period of limitations, and continuing to date,\n20 were arrested on any charge not involving weapons, controlled substances, or a charge of\n21 violence, and not involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where consent to\n22 search is a condition of such probation), and who were subjected to a blanket visual body\n23 cavity strip search by defendants before arraignment at a San Francisco County jail facility\n24 without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband.

Plaintiff Mary Bull alleges that she was arrested in San Francisco in November 2002 \n3  and charged with felony vandalism. Ms. Bull alleges that she was then taken to the \n4  San Francisco County Jail and subsequently searched and placed in a safety cell. \n5  5.  Plaintiff Jonah Zem alleges that he was arrested in San Francisco on January 18, \n6  2003 and charged with felony vandalism and resisting arrest with serious injury to a \n7  police officer.  Mr. Zem alleges that he was taken to the San Francisco County Jail \n8  and subsequently searched. \n9  6.  Plaintiff Lisa Giampaoli alleges that she was arrested in San Francisco on January 19, \n10  2002 and charged with felony aggravated assault.  Ms. Giampaoli alleges that she was \n11  taken to the San Francisco County Jail and subsequently searched and placed in a \n12  safety cell. \n13  7.  Plaintiff Marcy Comeau alleges that she was arrested in San Francisco on September \n14  5,2003, and charged with battery.  Ms. Comeau alleges that she was taken to the San \n15  Francisco County Jail and subsequently searched. \n16  8.

Plaintiff Leigh Fleming alleges that she was arrested in San Francisco on April 12, \n2  2003, and charged with disturbing the peace and resisting arrest.

Plaintiffs Mary Bull, Jonah Zern, Lisa Giampaoli, Marcy Comeau, Alexis Bronson, \n10  Micky Mangosing, Charli Johnson, Leigh Fleming, and Laura Timbrook allege that \n11  the policies of the San Francisco Sheriff's Department regarding search procedures \n12  and safety cell use violate the California and United States' Constitutions and the \n13  California Penal Code.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants' search and safety cell \n14  use policies as applied to them.  On January 21, 2004 Plaintiffs filed a Motion for \n15  Preliminary Injunction. \n16  14.  Defendants and Cross-complainants contend that injunctive relief is moot at this time \n17  as the policies applied to Plaintiffs no longer govern search or safety cell procedures \n18  in the San Francisco County Jail.  On January 21, 2004, San Francisco Sheriff \n19  Michael Hennessey adopted two new policies entitled \"Searches\" and \"Safety Cell \n20  Use,\" true copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits A and B, respeotively. \n21  Plaintiffs were on written notice that defendants intended to adopt these new policies \n22  on January 21,2004 and plaintiffs were invited to review and comment on the draft \n23  policies prior to their implementation.  Plaintiffs nevertheless elected to file a Motion \n24  for Preliminary Injunction on the very day that the new policies were adopted. \n25  15.  Defendants and Cross-complainants further contend that the Sheriff's Department's \n26  \"Searches\" policy adopted on January 21, 2004 satisfies the requirements of \n27  California Penal Code § 4030 and is constitutional under California and federal law. \n28 \nCCSF'S & SHERIFF's Cross-complaint for  4 \nDeclaratory Relief \nUSDC CASE NO.

Defendants and Cross-complainants contend that the Sheriff's Department's \"Safety \n2  Cell Use\" policy satisfies the requirements of the California Code of Regulations \n3  Title 15 and is constitutional under California and federal law. \n4  17.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Defendants and Cross-\n5  complainants and Cross-defendants in that San Francisco asserts that Plaintiffs' \n6  claims for injunctive relief are moot and that the new \"Searches\" and \"Safety Cell \n7  Use\" policies comply with state and federal law . \n8  DECLARATION SOUGHT \n9  18.  In order to resolve this controversy, Defendants and Cross-compiainants request that, \n10  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2201, this Court declare the respective rights and duties of the \n11  parties in this matter and, in particular, that the Court declare that:  1) Plaintiffs' and \n12  Cross-defendants' claim for injunctive relief is moot; and 2) the Sheriff's policies \n13  entitled \"Searches\" and \"Safety Cell Use,\" adopted January 21, 2004 and attached \n14  hereto as Exhibits A and B, respectively, comply with state and federal law. \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCCSF'S & SHERIFF's Cross-complaint for  5 \nDeclaratory Relief \nUSDC CASE NO.

In the jail, contraband also includes any item or article \nnot issued by ajail facility, purchased from the commissary, purchased through other \napproved channels, or approved by the Custody Division Commander or designee.  Any \nauthorized items found altered in any way, except for sharpened pencils, will also be \nconsidered contraband. \nNon-intrusive Sensor and Scanning Device Search:  A search conducted on a clothed \nperson using either a hand-held or walk-through mechanical device or metal detector or \nother non-intrusive detection device. \nPat Search:  A search consisting of a pat down or body frisk of a clothed person, \nincluding examination of pockets, shoes and socks.

General \nA.  A prisoner will be placed in a safety cell only with the approval of the Facility \nCommander, the Facility Watch Commander or a designated physician as \ndelegated by the Sheriff. \nB.  Safety cells may be used only under the following circumstances: \nPage 1 of5 \n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 63      Filed 01/22/2004     Page 18 of 21\nSafety Cell Use \n1.  When a prisoner is physically combative or otherwise presents an \nimminent danger to others. \n2.  When a prisoner is a danger to self, as determined by actions or words, \nincluding, but not limited to, physical or mental impairment to the point \nof falling down, banging hislher head against the wall, making suicidal \ngestures or threatening to commit suicide. \n3.  When there is reasonable suspicion the prisoner has ingested an injury \ncausing item. \n4.  When a prisoner requests such a placement. \n5.  When Jail Health Services staff recommends a safety cell placement and \nthe Watch Commander concurs after reviewing the basis for the Jail \nHealth Service recommendation. \nC.  The safety cell shall not be used for prisoners who only refuse to be strip searched \nor refuse other orders and do not otherwise meet the criteria for safety cell \nplacement above. \nD.  Only Jail Psychiatric Services staffmay determine a prisoner to be gravely \ndisabled. \nE.  In no case shall the safety cell be used for punishment or as a substitute for \ntreatment. \nII.  Safety Cell Placement \nA.  A supervisor must be present during the placement of a prisoner into the safety \ncell. \nB.  If a prisoner is cooperative, the prisoner should be allowed to walk to the safety \ncell. \nC.  If the prisoner refuses to walk, the restraint chair or some other mobile means, \nsuch as a gurney or wheelchair, should be considered and used, if appropriate. \nD.  Deputies may carry the prisoner as a last resort and in a manner that minimizes \ninjury to staff and prisoner. \nE.  If it is necessary to use force, the degree of force will be within the parameters set \nby the Department's \"Use of Force\" policy. \nF.  The reason for the safety cell placement will determine whether the prisoner is \nstripped of clothing. \n1.  In safety cell placements that result because the prisoner is a danger to \nself or at hislher request, the prisoner will be required to remove all \nclothing and a strip search will be conducted to ensure the prisoner does \nnot have contraband that poses a threat to hislher safety.  The prisoner \nwill immediately be given a safety cell garment and/or safety cell \nblanket. \n2.  Prisoners placed in a safety cell after being determined to be gravely \ndisabled by Jail Psychiatric staff will not be strip searched unless Jail \nPsychiatric staff believe the person may be a danger to self.

In safety cell placements that result because a prisoner is a danger to \nothers, the prisoner will be pat searched before being placed in the safety \ncell.  Clothing will not be removed nor will a strip search be conducted \nunless the supervisor approving the placement can articulate reasonable \nsuspicion that the prisoner has contraband hidden that poses a risk to \nprisoners, staff, or self. \n4.  The approving supervisor must document the reasonable suspicion \njustifying the strip search and complete the Strip Search Authorization \nform.  The form shall be kept on file at the jail facility for one year. \nAfter one year, the records should be put into storage and retained in \naccordance with the department records storage policy. \n5.  Any contraband found must also be documented in an Incident Report to \nbe attached to the Safety Cell Observation form. \nG.

For all other safety cell placements, the prisoner may be given an \nexchange of jail clothing or a safety cell garment and/or a safety blanket \nimmediately following the placement, if necessary. \n3.  The actual time when items were provided will be documented on the \nSafety Cell Observation form. \nH.  The deputy placing the prisoner in the safety cell is responsible for securing and \nproper storage of all personal property taken from the prisoner. \nI.  A prisoner may remain restrained, with handcuffs, waist chains and/or leg irons, \nas necessary, while in the safety cell to prevent self-inflicted injury.  Under no \ncircumstance will a prisoner remain in restraints in the safety cell for more than \none hour. \nJ.

Plaintiffs seek an\n9 order declaring illegal defendants’ policy of subjecting detainees in their custody to strip and visual\n10 body cavity searches before they are arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the\n11 searches will be productive of contraband. \n12 Plaintiffs also seek declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and punitive damages against\n13 the defendants for the policy, practice, and custom of placing detainees, naked, in rooms referred to as\n14 “cold rooms,” without any legitimate purpose, but in order to compel consent to illegal strip searches,\n15 to punish persons who question illegal practices, or for other illegal purposes.  These cold rooms are\n16 kept bone chillingly cold, lack access to natural light and are devoid of furniture and running water. \n17 The cold rooms are constantly illuminated by flourescent lighting and persons confined in them can\n18 only sit or lie on the bare floor.  Defendants’ use of the “cold rooms” violates Sections 1055 and 1083\n19 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations which specify that isolation or “safe rooms” which\n20 may have legitimate psychological uses cannot be used for punishment and that persons confined\n21 therein must be provided with adequate bedding and clothing. \n22 Defendants’ strip search, visual body cavity search, and cold room policies, practices, and\n23 customs violate plaintiffs’ rights secured to them by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n24 U.S. Constitution and entitle plaintiffs to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42\n25 U.S.C. § 1983).  \n26\nPage 2 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.

This action is brought pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth and\n12 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 USC §\n13 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.  \n14 2. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims under 28 USC §\n15 1367(a).\n16 3. The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs.\n17 PARTIES\n18 4. Plaintiffs, including MARY BULL, JONAH ZERN, LISA GIAMPAOLI, MARCY\n19 CORNEAU, ALEXIS BRONSON, MICKY MANGOSING, CHARLI JOHNSON, LEIGH\n20 FLEMING, and LAURA TIMBROOK, and all those similarly situated, are, and at all material times\n21 herein, were citizens of the United States and residents of the state of California who were arrested\n22 within the period beginning three (3) years before February 10, 2003, and continuing to this date, and\n23 who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at a San Francisco County Jail\n24 (hereinafter referred to as the “San Francisco Jail”), prior to being arraigned and/or without the\n25 defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be\n26 productive of contraband or weapons.\nPage 3 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 4 of 20\n1 5. Some plaintiffs, including MARY BULL, LISA GIAMPAOLI, ALEXIS BRONSON,\n2 MICKY MANGOSING, CHARLI JOHNSON and LEIGH FLEMING,  were confined by defendants\n3 in “cold rooms” at the San Francisco Jail to coerce compliance with illegal orders or for punishment in\n4 violation of their state and federal statutory and constitutional rights. \n5 6. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF MICHAEL\n6 HENNESSEY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of the city\n7 and county of San Francisco, responsible for administering the Jail facilities and for making,\n8 overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the\n9 operation of the San Francisco Jail.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.\n10 7. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their\n11 fictitious names (Does 1 through 150) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the San Francisco\n12 Jails, subjected plaintiffs to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without first\n13 having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of\n14 contraband or weapons.   Furthermore, Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF\n15 DEPUTIES sued herein by their fictitious names (Does 1 through 150) are all deputies who, as part of\n16 their duties at the San Francisco Jail, confined plaintiffs in “cold rooms” to gain compliance with\n17 illegal order or to punish plaintiffs.  \n18 8. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n19 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages of\n20 the State of California, the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and/or the SAN\n21 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF . \n22 9. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO is, and at all material times\n23 referred to herein, was, a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official\n24 policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained\n25 of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein alleged.  Plaintiffs’ allegations against the\n26 COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF and his deputies and on acts and\nPage 4 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 5 of 20\n1 omissions of persons who are COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’s breach of its duty to\n2 protect plaintiffs from the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees.\n3 10. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT and SAN\n4 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY, in his individual and official capacity,\n5 also maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the\n6 occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein\n7 alleged.\n8 11. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning\n9 three (3) years before February 10, 2003, and continuing to this date, were subjected by defendants to\n10 pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, and recording in\n11 writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n12 Some of the similarly situated plaintiffs were placed by defendants in “cold rooms,” in order to\n13 compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment and without defendants meeting the\n14 requirements governing the use of such rooms.\n15 FACTS\n16 A.   MARY BULL\n17 12. On or about November 18, 2002, plaintiff MARY BULL, along with many others, was\n18 arrested at a demonstration on Market Street, in San Francisco and charged with vandalism.  Ms.\n19 BULL was taken to the San Francisco Jail, arriving in mid-afternoon.  At approximately 6:00 p.m.,\n20 Ms. BULL was taken to an area to be “dressed-in.” A Sheriff’s deputy (Doe 1) prepared an inventory\n21 of Ms. BULL’s clothing and directed Ms. BULL to sign three documents, one of which was a consent\n22 to strip search which Ms. BULL refused to sign.  Her “dress-in” was terminated, and she was returned\n23 to a holding cell and held for a “classification” interview.  \n24 13. Three hours later, Ms. BULL  was returned to a dress-in room and again directed to\n25 consent to a visual body cavity search. Upon her refusal to consent to the visual body cavity search,\n26 Ms. BULL was taken from the “dress-in” area, to the center of the “bull pen” where she was\nPage 5 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 6 of 20\n1 confronted by several officers, male and female, one of whom told her that if she did not voluntarily\n2 submit to a visual body cavity search she would be thrown into a cold room, naked, for 24 hours. \n3 When Ms. BULL again declined to submit to the visual body cavity search, defendants moved her into\n4 the “cold room,” where she was subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 2 through 5. \n5 14. During the search, a male deputy (Doe 2) entered the room and watched as Ms.\n6 BULL’s clothes were pulled off, three deputies (Does 3 through 5) forced her to lie on her back,\n7 naked, bent her legs towards her chest, and visually inspected her genital and rectal areas.  Ms. BULL\n8 was then left naked in the “cold room” and the metal door shut.\n9 15. While Ms. BULL was in the “cold room,” she was shocked every few minutes by a\n10 sheriff’s deputies (Does 6 through 10) smashing a baton repeatedly against the door. The smashing of\n11 the baton on the unfurnished “cold room’s” metal door caused an unbearably loud, nerve-shattering\n12 noise, that prevented Ms. BULL from sleeping or resting and caused her to suffer extreme anxiety and\n13 emotional distress.\n14 16. During her time in the “cold room,” Ms. BULL was provided with neither clothing for\n15 her personal privacy nor with blankets or bedding as for a modicum of comfort.  Ms. BULL is\n16 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of\n17 utilizing confinement in the “cold room” as punishment for non-violent, non-suicidal, and non-\n18 destructive detainees who are dubbed “non-compliant” and that such a policy, practice, and custom\n19 violates the Constitution and laws of the State of California and the United States of America. \n20 17. At approximately 9:00 a.m. on November 19, 2002, Ms. BULL was removed from the\n21 “cold room,” issued some prison clothing, and placed in a holding cell with other detainees.  She was\n22 interviewed for release on her own recognizance and taken upstairs where she was again directed to\n23 consent to a visual body cavity search by Doe 11.  Again, Ms. BULL is informed and believes, and\n24 thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would\n25 result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n26\nPage 6 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 7 of 20\n1 18.  Ms. BULL explained to Doe 11 that the California and United States’ Constitutions\n2 and the state penal code preclude such strip searches and declined to cooperate.  Ms. BULL was taken\n3 into another “cold room,” and again subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 11\n4 through 15.  Ms. BULL was left naked in the “cold room” and later assigned to a cell with\n5 approximately eight bunkbeds.   At about 10:00 p.m., more than 30 hours after she was arrested, Ms.\n6 BULL was released on her own recognizance having never been arraigned.  Defendants had no\n7 reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or\n8 weapons.\n9 B.   JONAH ZERN\n10 19. On or about January 18, 2003, plaintiff JONAH ZERN was arrested along with others\n11 at a peace rally in San Francisco.  Mr. ZERN was taken to the San Francisco Jail where he held for\n12 two days before being released on his own recognizance without being arraigned.  Shortly after his\n13 arrival at the San Francisco Jail, Mr. ZERN was taken to a curtained off area where a Sheriff’s deputy,\n14 Doe 16, directed him to remove all his clothes.  The Sheriff’s deputy, Doe 16, then conducted a visual\n15 body cavity search of Mr. ZERN wherein Mr. ZERN had to bend over, spread his buttocks, and cough. \n16 Mr. ZERN is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion\n17 that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons. On or about\n18 January 23, 2003, the charges filed against Mr. ZERN were dismissed.  Defendants had no reasonable\n19 suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n20 C.   LISA GIAMPAOLI\n21 20. On or about July 19, 2002, plaintiff LISA GIAMPAOLI was arrested because her dog\n22 allegedly bit one of the young males harassing her outside of a computer/video cafe.  Ms.\n23 GIAMPAOLI was taken to the San Francisco County Jail where she was booked, placed in a holding\n24 cell and directed to disrobe in front of a male officer.  When Ms. GIAMPAOLI stated she believed she\n25 had the right to have some privacy and should not be required to remove her clothes in front of a male\n26 officer, she was grabbed and dragged into the cold room where male and female officers, Does 17, 18\nPage 7 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 8 of 20\n1 & 19,  pinned her to the ground and forcibly removed her pants, shirt and underwear.  Her bra was cut\n2 off of her body and she was left naked in the cold room for approximately 12 hours.  \n3 21. During the time Ms. GIAMPAOLI was kept in the cold room, approximately every 20\n4 minutes someone pounded on the door and a male officer would look in and see her naked.  She had\n5 only a hole in the ground to use as a toilet.  \n6 22. Ms. GIAMPAOLI was released the following day and no charges were ever filed\n7 against her.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in\n8 the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n9 D.   MARCY CORNEAU\n10 23. On or about September 5, 2003, plaintiff MARCY CORNEAU was arrested for\n11 allegedly fighting with her boyfriend.  At the San Francisco County Jail where she was taken, she was\n12 stripped and subjected to a visual body cavity search by Sheriff’s Deputy, Doe 20, who required her to\n13 bend over and spread her buttocks for visual examination of her anus and vaginal canal. Ms.\n14 CORNEAU was released two days later and all charges against her were dismissed.  Defendants had\n15 no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or\n16 weapons.\n17 E.   ALEXIS BRONSON\n18 24. On or about August 5, 2002, plaintiff ALEXIS BRONSON was arrested in San\n19 Francisco for allegedly being drunk in public and transported to San Francisco County Jail where he\n20 complied with Sheriff Deputy, Doe 21's directions to strip and submit to a visual body cavity search. \n21 Because he was allegedly not coughing loudly enough during the cavity search, five deputies, Does 22\n22 through 26, physically dragged him to a cold room where he was placed and kept naked for 12 hours\n23 with no food or water offered.   Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity\n24 search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.  No charges were ever filed against\n25 plaintiff BRONSON.\n26\nPage 8 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 9 of 20\n1 F.   MICKY MANGOSING\n2 25. On or about December 12, 2002, plaintiff MICKY MANGOSING was arrested for\n3 allegedly being drunk in public and transported to the San Francisco County Jail and placed in a\n4 holding cell.  Because she attempted to communicate with her friend who was also arrested about the\n5 whereabouts of her car keys, she was told to “shut up” by deputy Doe 27 and then forcibly removed\n6 from the holding cell, thrown down onto the ground and dragged to a cold room by three deputies,\n7 Does 28, 29 & 30, one of whom, defendant Doe 28, told her “take your clothes off bitch.”  Her\n8 clothes, including her bra and panties, were then torn off by defendants Does 28, 29 & 30 and she was\n9 left in the cold room for 12 hours, naked, without food, water or toilet paper, and regularly observed\n10 by a male deputy who kept looking in at her during her confinement.  Defendants had no reasonable\n11 suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n12 26. Ms. MANGOSING was released the following day and no charges were ever filed\n13 against her.\n14 G.   CHARLI JOHNSON\n15 27. On or about August 30, 2001, plaintiff CHARLI JOHNSON was arrested allegedly for\n16 public intoxication and transported to the San Francisco County Jail where she was stripped and\n17 subjected to a visual body cavity search by two male deputies, Does 31 and 32.  A full cavity search\n18 was conducted and her tampon was removed by defendant Deputies Does 31 an 32.  Ms. JOHNSON\n19 was confined in a cold room, naked, for approximately 12 hours and regularly viewed by male officers\n20 who looked in on her repeatedly.  She was released the next day at approximately noon and no charges\n21 were ever filed against her.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search\n22 would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n23 H.   LEIGH FLEMING\n24 28. On or about April 11, 2003, plaintiff LEIGH FLEMING was arrested in San Francisco\n25 for allegedly disturbing the peace.  She was transported to the San Francisco County Jail, subjected to\n26 a visual body cavity search by deputy, defendant Doe 33, and then confined in a cold room for over\nPage 9 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 10 of 20\n1 five hours, naked, during which time she was rattled by loud banging on the cell door every 20\n2 minutes.  No charges were ever filed against Ms. FLEMING.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion\n3 that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n4 I.   LAURA TIMBROOK\n5 29. On or about January 6, 2003, plaintiff LAURA TIMBROOK was arrested in San\n6 Francisco on an old warrant for writing checks with insufficient funds, and transported to the San\n7 Francisco County Jail where she was subjected to visual body cavity searches, twice, by deputies Does\n8 34 and 35, without reasonable suspicion that such searches would be productive of contraband or\n9 weapons.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the\n10 discovery of contraband or weapons.\n11 30. Within six months of her arrest, plaintiff MARY BULL filed a group government tort\n12 claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of said claim is attached hereto as\n13 Exhibit A, and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by this reference).  Plaintiff BULL’s group\n14 claim was denied on or about April 7, 2003, allowing the filing of this Complaint.  \n15 31. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely follow\n16 their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including plaintiffs, to strip\n17 and visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that\n18 the search will be productive of contraband or weapons.  \n19 32. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely\n20 follow their policy, practice and custom of confining detainees, including plaintiffs, in “cold rooms” in\n21 order to compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment.\n22 33. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the ability\n23 to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants’ custody, at\n24 the San Francisco Jail since February 10, 2000, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body\n25 cavity searches prior to arraignment without defendants first having, and recording, a reasonable\n26 suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\nPage 10 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 11 of 20\n1 34. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the\n2 ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs whom defendants confined in “cold rooms”\n3 since February 10, 2000, as means to compel compliance with directives or as a punishment. \n4 35. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is personally responsible for the\n5 promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n6 of the plaintiffs herein were subjected to the searches complained of herein. \n7 36. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is also personally responsible for the\n8 promulgation and continuation of the cold room policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n9 of the plaintiffs herein were confined in “cold rooms” as complained of herein.\n10 37. As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, each of the\n11 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due\n12 process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover\n13 damages according to proof, but, at a minimum, $1,000 as specified in California Penal Code §\n14 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n15 38.  As a result of being placed in a “cold room” as complained of herein, each of the\n16 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress and violation of due process of law and\n17 state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to\n18 proof, but, a minimum, $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n19 CLASS CLAIMS\n20 39. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs were subjected were\n21 performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants SHERIFF HENNESSEY, CITY\n22 AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, CITY AND COUNTY OF\n23 SAN FRANCISCO, and the individual deputies sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 150 \n24 The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense\n25 for which plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for cite\n26 and release under Penal Code § 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for\nPage 11 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 12 of 20\n1 and/or were released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of herein were\n2 performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintiffs so searched possessed\n3 weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable belief that the searches\n4 would produce contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved\n5 document. \n6 40. Defendants’ use of the “cold room” to compel compliance from, and/or to punish\n7 plaintiffs is in violation of Sections 1055 and 1083 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations\n8 (promulgated under the authority of California Penal Code section 6030) and the State and Federal\n9 Constitutions, in that defendants confine people to “cold rooms” to punish them and/or to compel\n10 compliance with directives.  Furthermore, defendants’ practice of placing people in the cold room\n11 naked is a violation of Section 1055, supra, and of plaintiffs’ rights to due process of law.\n12 41. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n13 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California Code of Civil Procedure\n14 § 382.  \n15 42. The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including\n16 February 10, 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices\n17 complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body\n18 cavity search at the San Francisco Jail without defendants having, and recording, a reasonable\n19 suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n20 43. The class also includes all persons during the period from and including February 10,\n21 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and/or the practices complained of\n22 herein cease, whom defendants improperly and unjustifiably confined in a cold room at the San\n23 Francisco Jail as a punishment and/or to compel compliance with a directive. \n24 44. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n25 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact\n26 number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are\nPage 12 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 13 of 20\n1 more than 100 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of defendants and\n2 subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n3 relating to said searches.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants\n4 improperly and unjustifiably confine more than 10 persons per day in cold rooms as punishment or to\n5 compel compliance with directives.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that\n6 there are tens of thousands of persons in the proposed class.\n7 45. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n8 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the class\n9 including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual\n10 body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in a San Francisco\n11 County Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment\n12 without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any\n13 particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be\n14 detected by means of a visual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity searches are\n15 conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in\n16 the searches, or whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups and/or in open areas\n17 where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the visual\n18 body cavity searches are reasonably related to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security\n19 of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n20 46.  Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n21 questions of fact concern the design, temperature,  upkeep, and use of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n22 not limited to: (1) whether the “cold rooms” are used to punish persons in defendants’ custody; (2)\n23 whether defendants properly monitor people placed in the “cold rooms”; (3) whether defendants\n24 routinely fail to provide people placed in the “cold rooms” with sufficient clothing to protect those\n25 persons’ privacy; and, (4) whether defendants routinely fail to provide people confined in the “cold\n26 rooms” with bedding.\nPage 13 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 14 of 20\n1 47. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n2 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the class\n3 including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity searches on\n4 persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts,\n5 to believe any particular inmate has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely\n6 be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity\n7 searches on persons without first reasonably relating the use of the visual body cavity search to\n8 defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less\n9 intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in\n10 areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating\n11 plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights and the protections afforded to plaintiffs under\n12 California Penal Code section 4030; and, (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search policy and\n13 procedure is in accordance with the State and/or Federal Constitution.\n14 48. Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n15 questions of law concern the nature, conditions, and temperature of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n16 not limited to: (1) whether defendants may use the cold rooms in the San Francisco County Jails for\n17 any reasons other than those stated in the Section 1055 of Title 15 of the California Code of\n18 Regulations without violating plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights protected by the Fourth\n19 and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) whether or\n20 not defendants’ “cold room” policies, practices, and customs are in accordance with the Constitution\n21 and laws of the State of California and/or the United States of America; and (3) whether or not\n22 defendants have established and implemented written plans as directed by Section 1050 of Title 15 of\n23 the California Code of Regulations (promulgated in under the authority of California Penal Code\n24 section 6030).\n25 49. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n26 representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, prior to arraignment, without\nPage 14 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 15 of 20\n1 reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or\n2 contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-\n3 approved writing), and plaintiff BULL was placed in a “cold room,” without sufficient clothing to\n4 protect her privacy, as punishment for her refusal to consent to a visual body cavity search. \n5 Representative plaintiffs have the same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the\n6 class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of\n7 subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches before arraignment without having, and\n8 recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or\n9 weapons.  Additionally, plaintiff BULL, in accordance with defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n10 was improperly and unjustifiably confined in a “cold room” as punishment after defendants used the\n11 threat of such confinement unsuccessfully to coerce plaintiff to comply with their directives. \n12 Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each\n13 class member suffered actual damages either as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity\n14 search and/or as a result of being improperly and unjustifiably placed and confined in a “cold room.” \n15 The actual damages suffered by representative plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual\n16 damages suffered by each class member.  \n17 50. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n18 plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ interests are consistent with\n19 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n20 51. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of\n21 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n22 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards\n23 of conduct for the parties opposing the class.  \n24 52. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of\n25 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications\n26\nPage 15 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 16 of 20\n1 with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially\n2 impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n3 53. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are\n4 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n5 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n6 respect to the class as a whole.  \n7 54. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is\n8 superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between\n9 the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of\n10 the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class\n11 members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and\n12 believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate suits\n13 would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members\n14 of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\n15 thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims\n16 arise in the same location; i.e., the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.  It will promote\n17 judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in\n18 multiple courts.  \n19 55. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are informed\n20 and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be ascertained from\n21 records maintained by the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and defendant SHERIFF\n22 MICHAEL HENNESSEY and defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S\n23 DEPARTMENT.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ records\n24 reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in\n25 custody in the San Francisco Jails.

Plaintiffs seek an\n26\nPage 1 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 2 of 17\n1 order declaring illegal defendants’ policy of subjecting detainees in their custody to strip and visual\n2 body cavity searches before they are arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the\n3 searches will be productive of contraband. \n4 Plaintiffs also seek declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and punitive damages against\n5 the defendants for the policy, practice, and custom of placing detainees, naked, in rooms referred to as\n6 “cold rooms,” without any legitimate purpose, but in order to compel consent to illegal strip searches,\n7 to punish persons who question illegal practices, or for other illegal purposes.  These cold rooms are\n8 kept bone chillingly cold, lack access to natural light and are devoid of furniture and running water. \n9 The cold rooms are constantly illuminated by flourescent lighting and persons confined in them can\n10 only sit or lie on the bare floor.  Defendants’ use of the “cold rooms” violates Sections 1055 and 1083\n11 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations which specify that isolation or “safe rooms” which\n12 may have legitimate psychological uses cannot be used for punishment and that persons confined\n13 therein must be provided with adequate bedding and clothing. \n14 Defendants’ strip search, visual body cavity search, and cold room policies, practices, and\n15 customs violate plaintiffs’ rights secured to them by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n16 U.S. Constitution and entitle plaintiffs to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42\n17 U.S.C. § 1983).  \n18 Additionally, plaintiffs include supplemental claims under California state law against\n19 defendants: 1) for violation of California Penal Code § 4030 which prohibits pre-arraignment strip\n20 searches of most misdemeanents and provides for minimum damages of $1,000 for each illegal search;\n21 2) for wholesale violation of Sections 1055 and 1083 of Section 15 of the California Code of\n22 Regulations (promulgated under the authority of California Penal Code § 6030) which describes the\n23 very narrow conditions under which a cold room can be used; and, 3) for violation of the Unruh Civil\n24 Rights Act (California Civil Code §§ 52 and 52.1(b)) pursuant to which each plaintiff denied a\n25 statutory or state or federal Constitutional right is entitled to recover a minimum of $4,000 for each\n26 violation.  \nPage 2 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 3 of 17\n1 JURISDICTION\n2 1. This action is brought pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth and\n3 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 USC §\n4 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.  \n5 2. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims under 28 USC §\n6 1367(a).\n7 3. The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs.\n8 PARTIES\n9 4. Plaintiffs, including MARY BULL and JONAH ZERN, and all those similarly situated,\n10 are, and at all material times herein, were citizens of the United States and residents of the state of\n11 California who were arrested within the period beginning three (3) years before February 10, 2003,\n12 and continuing to this date, and who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at a\n13 San Francisco County Jail (hereinafter referred to as the “San Francisco Jail”), prior to being arraigned\n14 and/or without the defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the\n15 searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n16 5. Some plaintiffs, including MARY BULL, were confined by defendants in “cold rooms”\n17 at the San Francisco Jail to coerce compliance with illegal orders or for punishment in violation of\n18 their state and federal statutory and constitutional rights. \n19 6. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF MICHAEL\n20 HENNESSEY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of the city\n21 and county of San Francisco, responsible for administering the Jail facilities and for making,\n22 overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the\n23 operation of the San Francisco Jail.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.\n24 7. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their\n25 fictitious names (Does 1 through 150) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the San Francisco\n26 Jails, subjected plaintiffs to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without first\nPage 3 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 4 of 17\n1 having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of\n2 contraband or weapons.   Furthermore, Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF\n3 DEPUTIES sued herein by their fictitious names (Does 101 through 150) are all deputies who, as part\n4 of their duties at the San Francisco Jail, confined plaintiffs in “cold rooms” to gain compliance with\n5 illegal order or to punish plaintiffs.  \n6 8. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n7 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages of\n8 the State of California, the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and/or the SAN\n9 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF . \n10 9. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO is, and at all material times\n11 referred to herein, was, a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official\n12 policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained\n13 of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein alleged.  Plaintiffs’ allegations against the\n14 COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF and his deputies and on acts and\n15 omissions of persons who are COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’s breach of its duty to\n16 protect plaintiffs from the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees.\n17 10. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT and SAN\n18 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY, in his individual and official capacity,\n19 also maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the\n20 occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein\n21 alleged.\n22 11. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning\n23 three (3) years before February 10, 2003, and continuing to this date, were subjected by defendants to\n24 pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, and recording in\n25 writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n26 Some of the similarly situated plaintiffs were placed by defendants in “cold rooms,” in order to\nPage 4 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 5 of 17\n1 compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment and without defendants meeting the\n2 requirements governing the use of such rooms.\n3 FACTS\n4 12. On or about November 18, 2002, plaintiff MARY BULL, along with many others, was\n5 arrested at a demonstration on Market Street, in San Francisco and charged with vandalism.  Ms.\n6 BULL was taken to the San Francisco Jail, arriving in mid-afternoon.  At approximately 6:00 p.m.,\n7 Ms. BULL was taken to an area to be “dressed-in.” A Sheriff’s deputy (Doe 1) prepared an inventory\n8 of Ms. BULL’s clothing and directed Ms. BULL to sign three documents, one of which was a consent\n9 to strip search which Ms. BULL refused to sign.  Her “dress-in” was terminated, and she was returned\n10 to a holding cell and held for a “classification” interview.  \n11 13. Three hours later, Ms. BULL  was returned to a dress-in room and again directed to\n12 consent to a visual body cavity search. Upon her refusal to consent to the visual body cavity search,\n13 Ms. BULL was taken from the “dress-in” area, to the center of the “bull pen” where she was\n14 confronted by several officers, male and female, one of whom told her that if she did not voluntarily\n15 submit to a visual body cavity search she would be thrown into a cold room, naked, for 24 hours. \n16 When Ms. BULL again declined to submit to the visual body cavity search, defendants moved her into\n17 the “cold room,” where she was subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 2 through 5. \n18 14. During the search, a male deputy (Doe 2) entered the room and watched as Ms.\n19 BULL’s clothes were pulled off, three deputies (Does 3 through 5) forced her to lie on her back,\n20 naked, bent her legs towards her chest, and visually inspected her genital and rectal areas.  Ms. BULL\n21 was then left naked in the “cold room” and the metal door shut.\n22 15. While Ms. BULL was in the “cold room,” she was shocked every few minutes by a\n23 sheriff’s deputy (Does 6 through 10) smashing a baton repeatedly against the door. The smashing of\n24 the baton on the unfurnished “cold room’s” metal door caused an unbearably loud, nerve-shattering\n25 noise, that prevented Ms. BULL from sleeping or resting and caused her to suffer extreme anxiety and\n26 emotional distress.\nPage 5 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 6 of 17\n1 16. During her time in the “cold room,” Ms. BULL was provided with neither clothing for\n2 her personal privacy nor with blankets or bedding as for a modicum of comfort.  Ms. BULL is\n3 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of\n4 utilizing confinement in the “cold room” as punishment for non-violent, non-suicidal, and non-\n5 destructive detainees who are dubbed “non-compliant” and that such a policy, practice, and custom\n6 violates the Constitution and laws of the State of California and the United States of America. \n7 17. At approximately 9:00 a.m. on November 19, 2002, Ms. BULL was removed from the\n8 “cold room,” issued some prison clothing, and placed in a holding cell with other detainees.  She was\n9 interviewed for release on her own recognizance and taken upstairs where she was again directed to\n10 consent to a visual body cavity search by Doe 11.  Again, Ms. BULL is informed and believes, and\n11 thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would\n12 result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n13 18.  Ms. BULL explained to Doe 11 that the California and United States’ Constitutions\n14 and the state penal code preclude such strip searches and declined to cooperate.  Ms. BULL was taken\n15 into another “cold room,” and again subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 11\n16 through 15.  Ms. BULL was left naked in the “cold room” and later assigned to a cell with\n17 approximately eight bunkbeds.   At about 10:00 p.m., more than 30 hours after she was arrested, Ms.\n18 BULL was released on her own recognizance having never been arraigned.\n19 19. On or about January 18, 2003, plaintiff JONAH ZERN was arrested along with others\n20 at a peace rally in San Francisco.  Mr. ZERN was taken to the San Francisco Jail where he held for\n21 two days before being released on his own recognizance without being arraigned.  Shortly after his\n22 arrival at the San Francisco Jail, Mr. ZERN was taken to a curtained off area where a Sheriff’s deputy,\n23 Doe 16, directed him to remove all his clothes.  The Sheriff’s deputy, Doe 16, then conducted a visual\n24 body cavity search of Mr. ZERN wherein Mr. ZERN had to bend over, spread his buttocks, and cough. \n25 Mr. ZERN is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion\n26\nPage 6 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 7 of 17\n1 that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons. On or about\n2 January 23, 2003, the charges filed against Mr. ZERN were dismissed.  \n3 20. Within six months of her arrest, plaintiff MARY BULL filed a group government tort\n4 claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of said claim is attached hereto as\n5 Exhibit A, and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by this reference).  Plaintiff BULL’s group\n6 claim was denied on or about April 7, 2003, allowing the filing of this Complaint.  \n7 21. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely follow\n8 their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including plaintiffs, to strip\n9 and visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that\n10 the search will be productive of contraband or weapons.  \n11 22. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely\n12 follow their policy, practice and custom of confining detainees, including plaintiffs, in “cold rooms” in\n13 order to compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment.\n14 23. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the ability\n15 to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants’ custody, at\n16 the San Francisco Jail since February 10, 2000, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body\n17 cavity searches prior to arraignment without defendants first having, and recording, a reasonable\n18 suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n19 24. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the\n20 ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs whom defendants confined in “cold rooms”\n21 since February 10, 2000, as means to compel compliance with directives or as a punishment. \n22 25. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is personally responsible for the\n23 promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n24 of the plaintiffs herein were subjected to the searches complained of herein. \n25 \\\\\\\n26 \\\\\\\nPage 7 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 8 of 17\n1 26. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is also personally responsible for the\n2 promulgation and continuation of the cold room policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n3 of the plaintiffs herein were confined in “cold rooms” as complained of herein.\n4 27. As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, each of the\n5 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due\n6 process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover\n7 damages according to proof, but, at a minimum, $1,000 as specified in California Penal Code §\n8 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n9 28.  As a result of being placed in a “cold room” as complained of herein, each of the\n10 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress and violation of due process of law and\n11 state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to\n12 proof, but, a minimum, $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n13 CLASS CLAIMS\n14 29. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs were subjected were\n15 performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants SHERIFF HENNESSEY, CITY\n16 AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, CITY AND COUNTY OF\n17 SAN FRANCISCO, and the individual deputies sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 150 \n18 The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense\n19 for which plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for cite\n20 and release under Penal Code § 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for\n21 and/or were released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of herein were\n22 performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintiffs so searched possessed\n23 weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable belief that the searches\n24 would produce contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved\n25 document. \n26 \\\\\\\nPage 8 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 9 of 17\n1 30. Defendants’ use of the “cold room” to compel compliance from, and/or to punish\n2 plaintiffs is in violation of Sections 1055 and 1083 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations\n3 (promulgated under the authority of California Penal Code section 6030) and the State and Federal\n4 Constitutions, in that defendants confine people to “cold rooms” to punish them and/or to compel\n5 compliance with directives.  Furthermore, defendants’ practice of placing people in the cold room\n6 naked is a violation of Section 1055, supra, and of plaintiffs’ rights to due process of law.\n7 31. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n8 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California Code of Civil Procedure\n9 § 382.  \n10 32. The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including\n11 February 10, 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices\n12 complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body\n13 cavity search at the San Francisco Jail without defendants having, and recording, a reasonable\n14 suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n15 33. The class also includes all persons during the period from and including February 10,\n16 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and/or the practices complained of\n17 herein cease, whom defendants improperly and unjustifiably confined in a cold room at the San\n18 Francisco Jail as a punishment and/or to compel compliance with a directive. \n19 34. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n20 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact\n21 number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are\n22 more than 100 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of defendants and\n23 subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n24 relating to said searches.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants\n25 improperly and unjustifiably confine more than 10 persons per day in cold rooms as punishment or to\n26\nPage 9 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that\n2 there are tens of thousands of persons in the proposed class.\n3 35. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n4 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the class\n5 including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual\n6 body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in a San Francisco\n7 County Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment\n8 without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any\n9 particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be\n10 detected by means of a visual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity searches are\n11 conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in\n12 the searches, or whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups and/or in open areas\n13 where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the visual\n14 body cavity searches are reasonably related to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security\n15 of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n16 36.  Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n17 questions of fact concern the design, temperature,  upkeep, and use of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n18 not limited to: (1) whether the “cold rooms” are used to punish persons in defendants’ custody; (2)\n19 whether defendants properly monitor people placed in the “cold rooms”; (3) whether defendants\n20 routinely fail to provide people placed in the “cold rooms” with sufficient clothing to protect those\n21 persons’ privacy; and, (4) whether defendants routinely fail to provide people confined in the “cold\n22 rooms” with bedding.\n23 37. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n24 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the class\n25 including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity searches on\n26 persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts,\nPage 10 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 11 of 17\n1 to believe any particular inmate has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely\n2 be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity\n3 searches on persons without first reasonably relating the use of the visual body cavity search to\n4 defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less\n5 intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in\n6 areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating\n7 plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights and the protections afforded to plaintiffs under\n8 California Penal Code section 4030; and, (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search policy and\n9 procedure is in accordance with the State and/or Federal Constitution.\n10 38. Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n11 questions of law concern the nature, conditions, and temperature of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n12 not limited to: (1) whether defendants may use the cold rooms in the San Francisco County Jails for\n13 any reasons other than those stated in the Section 1055 of Title 15 of the California Code of\n14 Regulations without violating plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights protected by the Fourth\n15 and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) whether or\n16 not defendants’ “cold room” policies, practices, and customs are in accordance with the Constitution\n17 and laws of the State of California and/or the United States of America; and (3) whether or not\n18 defendants have established and implemented written plans as directed by Section 1050 of Title 15 of\n19 the California Code of Regulations (promulgated in under the authority of California Penal Code\n20 section 6030).\n21 39. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n22 representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, prior to arraignment, without\n23 reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or\n24 contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-\n25 approved writing), and plaintiff BULL was placed in a “cold room,” without sufficient clothing to\n26 protect her privacy, as punishment for her refusal to consent to a visual body cavity search. \nPage 11 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 12 of 17\n1 Representative plaintiffs have the same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the\n2 class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of\n3 subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches before arraignment without having, and\n4 recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or\n5 weapons.  Additionally, plaintiff BULL, in accordance with defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n6 was improperly and unjustifiably confined in a “cold room” as punishment after defendants used the\n7 threat of such confinement unsuccessfully to coerce plaintiff to comply with their directives. \n8 Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each\n9 class member suffered actual damages either as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity\n10 search and/or as a result of being improperly and unjustifiably placed and confined in a “cold room.” \n11 The actual damages suffered by representative plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual\n12 damages suffered by each class member.  \n13 40. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n14 plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ interests are consistent with\n15 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n16 41. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of\n17 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n18 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards\n19 of conduct for the parties opposing the class.  \n20 42. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of\n21 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications\n22 with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially\n23 impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n24 43. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are\n25 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n26\nPage 12 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 13 of 17\n1 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n2 respect to the class as a whole.  \n3 44. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is\n4 superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between\n5 the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of\n6 the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class\n7 members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and\n8 believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate suits\n9 would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members\n10 of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\n11 thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims\n12 arise in the same location; i.e., the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.  It will promote\n13 judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in\n14 multiple courts.  \n15 45. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are informed\n16 and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be ascertained from\n17 records maintained by the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and defendant SHERIFF\n18 MICHAEL HENNESSEY and defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S\n19 DEPARTMENT.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ records\n20 reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in\n21 custody in the San Francisco Jails.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that\n22 records of, and maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity\n23 search, when the search occurred, where the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the\n24 search existed and was recorded in a supervisor-approved writing, when persons searched were\n25 arraigned, the charges on which such persons were arrested, whether persons were confined in a “cold\n26 room,” the justification recorded for placing individuals in a “cold room,” what articles of clothing\nPage 13 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1      Filed 04/23/2003     Page 14 of 17\n1 and/or bedding, if any, were provided to people placed in “cold rooms,” how long individuals\n2 remained in a “cold room,” and what treatment they received while so confined.  Plaintiffs are\n3 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing information is contained in\n4 defendants’ computer system and that the information necessary to identify the class members, by last\n5 known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily\n6 available from said computer system.  \n7 46. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class members\n8 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice\n9 to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe,\n10 and thereupon allege, that defendants’ computer records contain a last known address for class\n11 members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such last\n12 known address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class members of\n13 the following:\n14 i. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class;\n15 ii. The nature of the action;\n16 iii. Their right to “opt out” of the action within a given time, in which event they\n17 will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n18 iv. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to be represented by their own counsel and\n19 to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented by the\n20 named class plaintiffs and their counsel; and \n21 v. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to share in any recovery in favor of the\n22 class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues\n23 adverse to the class.  \n24 \\\\\\\n25 \\\\\\\n26 \\\\\\\nPage 14 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

Now before the Court is a motion by plaintiffs for partial\n20\nsummary judgment regarding several of their strip search claims under federal and state law. \n21\nAfter carefully reviewing the memoranda and evidentiary record submitted by the parties,\n22\nand having had the benefit of a lengthy oral argument, the Court hereby GRANTS IN PART\n23\nand DENIES IN PART plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.\n24\nDefendant Michael Hennessey has also filed a motion for summary judgment\n25\nregarding qualified immunity.

Factual History\n3 The San Francisco Sheriff’s Department (“the Department”) oversees six county jails. \n4 After arrest, all arrestees are brought to County Jail 9 where within twenty-four hours of\n5 arriving they are booked and a determination is made as to whether the detainee will be\n6 released or housed pending arraignment.  County Jail 9 is a temporary detention facility and\n7 does not contain accommodations for extended stays.  Thus, all detainees who are classified\n8 for housing are transferred to another one of the CCSF’s jails.  According to defendant,\n9 approximately 50,000 individuals are booked and processed through this system each year.\n10 Under Department policy in effect until January 21 2004,1 all arrestees entering\n11 County Jail 9 were subjected to a pat search and screened by a metal detector.  The policy\nt\nr\nu 12 also provided for strip searches2 of detainees who fell into several categories, including:\no\nC\n  13 arrestees charged with crimes involving narcotics, weapons or violence; arrestees with a\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 criminal history of that type; individuals arrested for a probation violation; individuals\ns D ct of 15 arrested outside of San Francisco; arrestees in transit to another jail; arrestees classified for\nte stri\na Di16 housing in the general jail population; and individuals placed in “safety cells.”  Safety cells\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 are single-occupant, padded cells used to house inmates who were considered a danger to\nUnit or the 18 themselves or others, to be behaving in a “bizarre” manner or to be “gravely disabled.” \nF\n19 Although not provided for in the Department’s written policy, plaintiffs also contend that\n20 defendants maintained a practice of performing strip searches on all detainees who signed a\n21 form indicating that they consented to such searches.\n22 According to defendants, the Department’s strip search policy was applied as follows:\n23 upon arrival at County Jail 9 all inmates who were deemed searchable based on their charge\n24\n1The Department’s new policy, which went into effect in January 2004 and currently\n25 remains in effect, is not at issue in these motions.\n26 2As noted in the Court’s prior order, the Court recognizes that there is a spectrum of\npossible search practices, including strip searches and visual body cavity searches, that fall\n27 within the general rubric of “strip searches.”  The Court and the parties have used this label to\ncover all such practices.  As it has before, the Court will adhere to the understanding that the\n28 distinctions within this category of searches make no difference in the analysis performed for\nthe purposes of this motion. \n2\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 3 of 25\n1 or criminal history were automatically strip searched.  Other arrestees were generally not\n2 strip searched unless they were identified for placement in a safety cell or, through the\n3 booking process, it was determined that the detainee would not be released within twenty-\n4 four hours and therefore would need to be housed in another jail facility.  For example,\n5 individuals who were cited and released, individuals who were temporarily detained because\n6 they were intoxicated, and individuals who said they would be able to post bail would be\n7 classified for release and therefore not be strip searched.  In summary, the Department\n8 adopted a policy of strip searching all individuals who were classified for housing in the\n9 general jail population. \n10 Strip searches at County Jail 9 have led to the discovery of weapons and other\n11 contraband on the persons of arrestees.  Defendant produced evidence that from April 2000\nt\nr\nu 12 through April 2005 strip searches at County Jail 9 resulted in the discovery of 73 cases of\no\nC\n  13 illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia hidden in body cavities.  In that same time period, six\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 weapons were also discovered as a result of strip searches.  In addition, safety cell searches\ns D ct of 15 resulted in the discovery of weapons on three other detainees.3  \nte stri\na Di16 II.  Procedural History\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 Plaintiffs filed this action on April 23, 2003 alleging causes of action based on the\nUnit or the 18 Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. section\nF\n19 1983, and several provisions of state law.  In an order issued June 10, 2004, this Court\n20 granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3).  The class was defined as:\n21 All persons who, during the applicable period of limitations, and\ncontinuing to date, were arrested on any charge not involving\n22 weapons, controlled substances, or a charge of violence, and not\ninvolving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where\n23 consent to search is a condition of such probation), and who were\nsubjected to a blanket visual body cavity strip search by\n24 defendants before arraignment at a San Francisco County jail\nfacility without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they\n25\n26 3Notably, defendants provided contraband reports for a period that includes searches\nconducted under both the prior policy and the newer policy.  If these reports are divided into the\n27 two policy periods, the result is that 49 instances of drug-related contraband were discovered\nduring the old regime and 14 instances were discovered after the change.  As for weapons, three\n28 were found in non-safety cell searches prior to enactment of the new policy and three were found\nafterwards.  All safety cell discoveries were made prior to the policy change.\n3\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 4 of 25\n1 were concealing contraband.  This class also includes 1) all\narrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket strip\n2 search(es) before arraignment after the initial strip search,\nwithout any reasonable individualized suspicion that they had\n3 subsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons;\nand 2) all persons who, prior to arraignment, were subjected to\n4 blanket visual body cavity search(es) incident to placement in a\n“safety cell” at any of the San Francisco County jails.\n5\n(emphasis in original).\n6\n   Plaintiffs now move for partial summary judgment with respect to several of their\n7\nclaims and regarding several affirmative defenses.  Defendant Sheriff Hennessey moves for\n8\nsummary judgment that he is protected by qualified immunity.\n9\nDISCUSSION\n10\nI.  Summary Judgment Standard\n11\nt Summary judgment is appropriate when the “pleadings, depositions, answers to\nr\nu 12\no\nC interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\n  13\nt\nic nia no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nistr Califor14 matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  “In considering a motion for summary judgment, the\ns D ct of 15\nte stri court may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations, and is required to draw\na Di16\nSt ern  all inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.”  Freeman v. Arpaio, 125\n  h\nUnited or the Nort1178 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997).  A principal purpose of the summary judgment procedure is to\nF identify and dispose of factually unsupported claims.  See Celotex Corp. v. Cattrett, 477 U.S.\n19\n317, 323-24 (1986).\n20\nThe party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of identifying those\n21\nportions of the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits which demonstrate the absence of a\n22\ngenuine issue of material fact.  See id. at 323.  Where the moving party will have the burden\n23\nof proof on an issue at trial, it must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact\n24\ncould find other than for the moving party.  See id.  Once the moving party meets this initial\n25\nburden, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and by its own evidence “set\n26\nforth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  The\n27\nnon-moving party must “identify with reasonable particularity the evidence that precludes\n28\nsummary judgment.”  Keenan v. Allan, 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Richards\n4\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 5 of 25\n1 v. Combined Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 247, 251 (7th Cir. 1995)).  If the non-moving party fails to\n2 make this showing, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Celotex,\n3 477 U.S. at 323.\n4 II.  Federal Claims\n5 Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on several issues that underlie their claim that\n6 defendants’ prior strip search policy was unconstitutional pursuant to the Fourth and\n7 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and therefore is actionable under\n8 42 U.S.C. section 1983.  \n9 The claim that a strip search was performed in violation of the Fourth Amendment is\n10 neither new nor unfamiliar.  In 1979 the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of the\n11 practice of conducting visual body-cavity searches on prison inmates following contact visits\nt\nr\nu 12 by individuals from outside of the prison population.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558\no\nC\n  13 (1979).  The Court remarked that “[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.”  Id. at 559.  Instead, “[i]n\ns D ct of 15 each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\nte stri\na Di16 personal rights that the search entails.”  Id.  The Court concluded that the search practice\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 there at issue was not unconstitutional given the significant interest in preserving safety\nUnit or the 18 within the detention facility and preventing the smuggling of contraband.  Id.  \nF\n19 Since Bell, the Ninth Circuit has taken up the question of the lawfulness of strip\n20 searches in cases like this one involving pre-arraignment arrestees.  In the first case to\n21 consider the subject, Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam)\n22 (overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.\n23 1999) (en banc)), the court announced the governing standard that “arrestees for minor\n24 offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion\n25 that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or suffering from a\n26 communicable disease.”  746 F.2d at 615.  Such reasonable suspicion may be based on\n27 factors such as “the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the\n28 prior arrest record.”  Id. at 617.  Applying this standard, the court concluded that the policy\n5\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 6 of 25\n1 of the Bonneville County Jail in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to strip search all arrestees booked there\n2 was unconstitutional.  Id. at 617.  The court found that there was no reasonable suspicion to\n3 support the search of the plaintiff because of the minor nature of the offense (failure to pay\n4 parking tickets), the fact she had no prior record and because she had been cooperative\n5 during the search.  Id. at 618.  \n6 The court has revisited pre-arraignment searches several times, on each occasion\n7 reaffirming the standard laid out by Giles.  Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329 (9th\n8 Cir. 1986) found no qualified immunity for a San Diego County Sheriff that had enacted a\n9 blanket strip search policy which resulted in the visual body cavity search of a misdemeanor\n10 arrestee prior to a determination regarding the arrestee’s eligibility for an own recognizance\n11 (“O.R.”) release.  See id. at 1333.  In Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th\nt\nr\nu 12 Cir. 1989) the court found valid the strip search of a felony grand theft auto arrestee at the\no\nC\n  13 Los Angeles County Jail, stating that the offense in question was “sufficiently associated\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 with violence to justify a visual strip search.”  Id. at 1447.  In a later case, however, the court\ns D ct of 15 found fault with the City of Los Angeles’s blanket policy subjecting all felony arrestees to a\nte stri\na Di16 visual body cavity search and the Los Angeles Police Department’s (“LAPD”) application of\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 that policy to a woman arrested for a grand theft that did not involve drugs or violence.  See\nUnit or the 18 Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 710-16 (9th Cir. 1990).  Then, in Fuller\nF\n19 v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir. 1991), the court clarified that strip searches in\n20 detention facilities are justified on less than probable cause solely by the need “to protect\n21 prisons and jails from smuggled weapons, drugs or other contraband which pose a threat to\n22 the safety and security of penal institutions.”  Id. at 1447.  The court refused to extend the\n23 reasonable suspicion standard to body cavity searches for ordinary stolen property, id. at\n24 1448, and thus ruled invalid the strip search by the LAPD of two women suspected of having\n25 stolen a ring.  Id. at 1450.  \n26 A.  Facial Attacks\n27 Against this backdrop, plaintiffs move for summary judgment that defendants’ former\n28 strip search policy and custom was facially unconstitutional with respect to several blanket\n6\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 7 of 25\n1 search categories: (1) arrestees with one or more prior convictions or two or more prior\n2 arrests for crimes involving drugs, weapons or violence; (2) arrestees charged with a\n3 probation violation; (3) individuals arrested on a San Francisco warrant outside of San\n4 Francisco County; (4) individuals arrested on a federal charge; (5) individuals held at a San\n5 Francisco jail while in transit to another part of the state; (6) arrestees classified for housing\n6 in a county jail; (7) individuals placed in safety cells; and (8) individuals strip searched\n7 because they signed a consent form.\n8 Defendants do not oppose summary judgment on classifications (1) - (5).  The Court\n9 therefore grants summary judgment with respect to those portions of the policy.  Defendants\n10 do, however, contest that strip searches of arrestees within categories (6) - (8) violate the\n11 Fourth Amendment.  \nt\nr\nu 12 1.  “Classification” Searches\no\nC\n  13 Defendants claim that the jail system’s interest in strip searching pre-trial detainees is\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 at its zenith when arrestees are “classified” for housing in the general jail population.  This is\ns D ct of 15 true because the introduction of outsiders into the jail system--as opposed to the temporary\nte stri\na Di16 detention facilities at County Jail 9--poses heightened safety risks to prisoners and guards\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 alike, given the large number of detainees in the jail system and the extended period of\nUnit or the 18 detention.  Under defendants’ vision of the governing law, these concerns allow for blanket\nF\n19 strip searches without individualized suspicion.  This position, however, fails in the face of\n20 Ninth Circuit precedent to the contrary.\n21 Although defendants are correct that the government’s penological interests are\n22 heightened when temporary detainees are introduced into the general jail population, such\n23 intermingling on its own does not create reasonable suspicion to perform a strip search.  As\n24 stated by the Ninth Circuit, although the fact an arrestee is to be “placed into contact with the\n25 general jail population” is one important factor among many that may be considered in\n26 / / /\n27 / / /\n28 / / /\n7\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 8 of 25\n1  gauging the reasonableness of a search, “such a factor by itself cannot justify a strip\n2 search.”4  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447; see also Giles, 746 F.2d at 618-19 (rejecting the\n3 notion that placement in the general jail population was enough to validate a strip search\n4 because “intermingling is both limited and avoidable” (citation and internal quotation\n5 omitted)).  Rather than relying on intermingling, the Ninth Circuit has instead found that “the\n6 reasonableness determination . . . hinges upon the nature of the . . . offense with which [the\n7 arrestee] was charged.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447.  \n8 Acknowledging this precedent, defendants insist that the intermingling of temporary\n9 detainees with the general population is not the sole basis for strip searches in this case;\n10 instead they claim that this factor combined with the documented record of serious and\n11 widespread contraband smuggling at San Francisco’s jails together provide justification for\nt\nr\nu 12 the blanket policy.  They claim that a threat of these proportions was not present in the\no\nC\n  13 Bonneville jail considered in Giles, and thus the individualized suspicion limitation\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 articulated there does not extend to this case.\ns D ct of 15 / / /\nte stri\na Di16\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 4Defendants claim that Fuller is to the contrary.   There the Ninth Circuit cited with\nUnit or the 18 aCpirp.r 1o9v8al7 t)h. e T Shiaxtt hc aCseir fcouuitn’sd  dtheacti sai ocno uinn tDy ohbardo wnootl srukny ja vfo. uJel foffe rtshoen F Couorutnht ya,m 8e2n3d mF.e2ndt  9w5h5e (r6e tiht\nF had initially conducted a pat down search and did not perform a strip search until the plaintiff\n19 “was about to be moved into contact with the general jail population.”  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1448\n(quoting Dobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 958).  \n20\nHowever, Fuller also approvingly cited a later Sixth Circuit case,  Masters v. Crouch, 872\n21 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989), for the proposition that the “fact that [the] detainee was intermingled\nwith other inmates has never alone been found to justify a strip search without considering the\n22 nature of the offense and whether the detainee might attempt to introduce weapons or contraband\ninto the institution.”  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1448 (emphasis added) (quoting Masters, 872 F.2d at\n23 1254).  Master relied in part on Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir. 1984), which found that\n“intermingling [with the prison population] is only one factor to consider in judging the\n24 constitutionality of a strip search,” id. at 394, and that where, as were the circumstances there,\n“[n]o other conceivable justification exists for the strip search,” id., the search is invalid.  See\n25 id. (considering the nature of the offense at issue and finding that it was “not commonly\nassociated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband”).  \n26\nA fair reading of Fuller leads to the conclusion that the court there, consistent with\n27 Thompson and the governing law in the Ninth Circuit, treated the intermingling of an arrestee\nwith the general jail population as only one factor among many that might justify a search.\n28 Notably, Thompson cited both Dobrowolskyj and Masters in arriving at its conclusion that\nintermingling alone does not justify a strip search.  See Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447.\n8\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 9 of 25\n1 As has the Ninth Circuit on several occasions, this Court recognizes the pressing need\n2 to maintain security in jails and prisons and the real and profound threats posed by the\n3 introduction of weapons and drugs into that environment.  See, e.g., Thompson, 885 F.2d at\n4 1446 (“the prevention of the introduction of weapons and other contraband into the jail . . . is\n5 indeed an extremely weighty interest”);  Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (“These concerns and this\n6 interest no doubt are weighty.”).  However, defendants claim that the Giles test does not\n7 extend to urban jails is belied by subsequent cases.  Thompson specifically rejected the\n8 notion that intermingling alone--without consideration of some individualized basis for\n9 suspicion--was enough to justify a strip search and did so in the context of the Los Angeles\n10 County Jail system.  \n11 To adopt defendants’ view that the severity of the smuggling problem can justify a\nt\nr\nu 12 blanket strip search policy would be to ignore the consistent holdings of the Ninth Circuit\no\nC\n  13 that reasonable suspicion may only be founded upon facts that are particular to the individual\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 arrestee.  See Giles, 746 F.2d at 615 (holding that there must be reasonable suspicion that\ns D ct of 15 “the particular arrestee” is concealing contraband); Ward, 791 F.2d at 1333 (summing up\nte stri\na Di16 Giles’ holding as requiring “individualized suspicion”); Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1446 (“the\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 arresting officers must have reasonable individualized suspicion”).  Such individualized\nUnit or the 18 suspicion may arise from knowledge of specific facts about the individual defendant,\nF\n19 including “the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the prior\n20 arrest record.”  Giles 746 F.2d at 617.  It is not enough, as defendants would have it, for the\n21 government to demonstrate that contraband smuggling is a significant problem.  Instead,\n22 there must be some reasonable relationship between the criteria used to identify individuals\n23 as eligible for a strip search and the interest in preventing the introduction of contraband. \n24 See Giles, 746 F.2d at 618 (reasonableness requirement under the Fourth Amendment\n25 requires that the strip search bear some “discernible relationship to security needs” (quoting\n26 Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981)).  \n27 Defendants’ policy of strip searching all arrestees classified for housing in the general\n28 jail population, coupled with their knowledge of a widespread problem with contraband\n9\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 10 of 25\n1 smuggling in the jail system, is an invalid basis for the blanket policy because these two facts\n2 say nothing about whether an individual arrestee classified pursuant to this policy may be\n3 concealing weapons or drugs.  Individuals destined for housing in the jail may have been\n4 classified as such solely because they are not able to post bail or because they have not yet\n5 received an O.R. review.5  Yet the Ninth Circuit has rejected the view that these reasons\n6 alone can justify a strip search.  See Ward, 791 F.2d at 1333 (citing with approval Tinetti v.\n7 Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490 (E.D. Wis. 1979) in which the court found unconstitutional the\n8 strip search without reasonable suspicion of an individual who was unable to post bond); id.\n9 (“In most instances the unreasonableness of a strip search conducted prior to an O.R. release\n10 determination is plain.”).\n11 Had defendants been able to proffer evidence demonstrating a high level of smuggling\nt\nr\nu 12 by individuals classified for housing who were not charged with crimes involving weapons,\no\nC\n  13 drugs or violence (or within another valid strip search category) then an issue of fact may\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 have been created.  See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (stressing the importance of\ns D ct of 15 documentation supporting the assertion that arrestees within the strip search category\nte stri\na Di16 smuggle contraband into the jail in greater frequency than arrestees outside of the category). \nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 Such a showing may have demonstrated that the charge alone was not enough to identify\nUnit or the 18 potential smugglers and supported a reasonable suspicion that other classes of individuals\nF\n19 destined for the jail were likely to be carrying contraband.  The evidence produced by\n20 defendants does not support such a theory.  While defendants did produce dozens of reports\n21 regarding the discovery of contraband during strip searches, the reports fail to provide any\n22 indication of the charges of the searched individuals or the reason why they were searched. \n23 Absent such evidence there is no reasonable relationship between the criteria triggering a\n24 search (classification for housing) and the interest in conducting the search (eliminating the\n25 introduction of contraband).  See id. (finding the policy at issue unconstitutional because it\n26\n27\n5Indeed one witness testified that the O.R. staff at County Jail 9 is only available to\n28 perform interviews for eight hours a day.  Individuals who were not given an O.R. interview\nduring the booking process were nonetheless sent for a housing classification.\n10\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 11 of 25\n1 rested on assumptions and societal judgments, rather than on careful deliberation and\n2 documentary evidence). \n3 Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Department’s former policy requiring strip\n4 searches of all detainees classified for housing in the general jail population without any\n5 consideration of the crime charged or any other individualized factors was unconstitutional. \n6 This, however, does not end the inquiry:\n7 [A] search, although not supportable under an institutional\npolicy, is not per se unconstitutional. [After determining the\n8 policy is invalid, the court] must . . . examine the particular\ncircumstances surrounding [the detainee’s] arrest to determine\n9 whether there was reasonable suspicion to conduct a visual body-\ncavity search\n10\nKennedy, 901 F.2d at 715; see also Tardiff v. Knox County, 364 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004). \n11\nt Except with regard to the individual plaintiffs discussed below, the Court does not today\nr\nu 12\no\nC reach the question of whether searches performed on individual members of the class were\n  13\nt\nic nia justified based on facts particular to the individual search.  See Bull v. City & County of San\nistr Califor14 Francisco, No. 03-1840, Memorandum & Order (Doc. # 162), slip op. at 11 (N.D. Cal. June\ns D ct of 15\nte stri 10, 2004) (stating that where the policy cannot by itself justify a search “it is a fair guess that\na Di16\nSt ern  most arrestees were searched” on the basis of the policy although “any potential\n  h\nUnited or the Nort1178 individualized issues can be addressed later in the litigation and do not defeat class\nF certification”).\n19\n2.  Safety Cell Searches\n20\nPlaintiffs also challenge the Department’s policy of automatically strip searching\n21\ndetainees on the sole basis that they have been designated for placement in a safety cell. \n22\nDetainees were placed in a safety cell if they fit into one of six categories:  “1.  She/he\n23\ndisplays bizarre behavior which results in the destruction of property.  2.  She/he displays\n24\nbizarre behavior which reveals an intent to cause self-inflicted harm.  3.  She/he appears\n25\ngravely disabled and less restrictive housing is unavailable.  4.  She/he appears to be a danger\n26\nto self or others.  5.  She/he requests to use the safety cell.  6.  For observation only, if it is\n27\ndetermined by direct observation that the prisoner has ingested items that may cause injury.” \n28\n“Safety Cell Use” I.A.  From these classifications it appears that individuals were generally\n11\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 12 of 25\n1 placed in a safety cell, and therefore strip searched, if prison officials determined that the\n2 individual appeared to be suffering from mental illness or was otherwise mentally unstable\n3 such that there was a perceived risk that the detainee might engage in violent or self-\n4 destructive conduct.  Plaintiffs contend that the chosen categories are vague and overbroad,\n5 and therefore seek a ruling that the policy is unconstitutional on its face.\n6 The Court first notes that the law on this subject is not clearly established.  Neither\n7 party has found any case that discusses strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees based on\n8 the determination that the individual is psychologically unstable.  Of course, such detainees\n9 present unique and substantial safety concerns that prison officials should be free to address,\n10 in part, by ensuring that the detainees are not hiding weapons or other contraband that may be\n11 used to harm themselves or others.  Defendants here have presented evidence that mentally\nt\nr\nu 12 unstable detainees in San Francisco’s jail system have hidden contraband and have used such\no\nC\n  13 contraband in attempts to harm themselves or others.  These findings are even more serious\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 in light of the Eighth Amendment obligations of jail mangers to prevent prisoner suicide. \ns D ct of 15 See Woodward v. Correctional Medical Services, 368 F.3d 917, 929 (7th Cir. 2004).  \nte stri\na Di16 Standing against these valid safety concerns are the fundamental privacy interests that\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 are infringed by the extreme intrusiveness of a strip search.  These interests are no less\nUnit or the 18 profound when the subject of the search is mentally disturbed.  See Aiken v. Nixon, 236\nF\n19 F.Supp.2d 211, 233 (N.D.N.Y. 2002) (discussing privacy interests in the context of strip\n20 searches of individuals held in a psychiatric hospital).  \n21 The interests at stake in safety cell searches (prison safety and prisoner privacy) are\n22 therefore identical to those considered in Giles and its progeny.  The Court therefore finds\n23 that the Giles requirement of reasonable individualized suspicion is the appropriate test for\n24 strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees believed to be a danger to themselves or others\n25 due to mental instability.  See Aiken, 236 F.Supp.2d at 233-34 (adopting “reasonable\n26 suspicion” standard for strip searches of individuals who voluntarily admitted themselves\n27 into a psychiatric hospital).  As articulated by Giles, important factors include “the nature of\n28 the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.”  746 F.2d at\n12\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 13 of 25\n1 617.  Of course, in this context different conduct and charges may justify a search than in the\n2 ordinary case.  For example conduct indicating a detainee may be mentally disturbed in a\n3 manner that may lead to unpredictable and potentially harmful conduct could serve as a valid\n4 justification for a search.  In addition, the searches may be based on a suspicion that types of\n5 “contraband” not ordinarily believed to be dangerous, such as shoelaces and other items used\n6 for self-strangulation, may be hidden.  Nonetheless, the basic framework articulated in Giles\n7 remains the appropriate analytical procedure to evaluate these claims.  \n8 Turning to the policy at issue, the constitutionality of a policy that requires that all\n9 individuals placed in a safety cell be strip searched depends on the reasons for the safety cell\n10 placement.  Under Giles, if the policy requires a reasonable individualized suspicion that the\n11 detainee may be concealing drugs or other dangerous contraband, then the policy should be\nt\nr\nu 12 upheld.  In the context of mentally unstable detainees, this Court finds that individualized\no\nC\n  13 suspicion can be founded upon behavior or circumstances indicating that the detainee may be\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 a danger to herself or others.  Such behavior gives rise to legitimately heightened concerns\ns D ct of 15 that the detainee could be concealing “contraband” that might be used for harmful purposes,\nte stri\na Di16 and thus serves as a reasonable basis for a strip search.\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 Here, some criteria identified by the policy at issue are reasonably related to this\nUnit or the 18 security interest.  These are categories 2 (“bizarre behavior” and “intent to cause self-\nF\n19 inflicted harm”); 4 (“danger to self or others”); and 6 (“ingested items that may cause\n20 injury”).  However, the other categories do not reveal a similar level of relatedness to the\n21 interest in safety.  Category 1 (“bizarre behavior” and “destruction of property”), for\n22 example, could be applied to an individual who has done nothing more than acted in a\n23 “bizarre” fashion and committed vandalism.  Category 3 (“gravely disabled” and “housing\n24 unavailable”) could easily be applied to a physically disabled person who for safety reasons\n25 should not be placed in an ordinary cell.  Similarly, there is no requirement in category 5\n26 (“requests to use the safety cell”) that an officer make an individualized determination that\n27 the detainee raises safety concerns.  See Aiken, 236 F.Supp.2d at 233-34 (concluding that\n28 individuals who voluntarily admit themselves to a psychiatric ward do not surrender all\n13\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 14 of 25\n1 privacy protections and that strip searches of such admittees must be based on reasonable\n2 suspicion of concealed drugs or weapons, but not other concealed items).\n3 Plaintiffs would have this Court go further and declare all of the safety cell categories\n4 to be so overbroad and vague as to be unconstitutional on their face.  Admittedly, none of the\n5 categories are defined with objective terms that substantially constrain the individual\n6 officer’s discretion.  However, the process of identifying particular conduct that is indicative\n7 of psychiatric disturbance which in turn signals a propensity for violent or self-destructive\n8 conduct is inherently subjective and cannot be easily reduced to objective terms.  For this\n9 reason, officers must be given considerable latitude in making this kind of determination. \n10 Thus it was reasonable for the Department to craft a policy that leaves broad discretion with\n11 the individual officer.  \nt\nr\nu 12 However, since such discretion is to be exercised by the individual officers, the Fourth\no\nC\n  13 Amendment analysis must focus on the factors considered by those officers.  An individual\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 officer’s subjective finding that a detainee was a danger to self or others, without any facts\ns D ct of 15 articulated in support, is not enough to end the inquiry into whether a particular search was\nte stri\na Di16 constitutional.  Thus, although the Department’s policy of allowing individual officers broad\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 discretion to determine which detainees pose a danger to themselves or others is not\nUnit or the 18 unconstitutional on its face, plaintiffs may still prevail on their section 1983 claims by\nF\n19 showing that the individual officers exercised such discretion in an unconstitutional manner. \n20 For example, plaintiff Miki Mangosing was placed in a safety cell and strip searched\n21 pursuant to the determination that she was a danger to herself.  Records indicate that she was\n22 perceived to be under the influence, out of control and unable to remain in a sobering cell. \n23 Whether these and other facts support the responsible officers’ conclusion that Mangosing\n24 was a risk to herself is a question to be resolved by the appropriate factfinder.\n25 In summary, the Court finds that the Department’s policy of strip searching all\n26 individuals placed in a safety cell, without regard for the reasons for the particular placement,\n27 is unconstitutional on its face.  Further, even with respect to searches conducted under the\n28 policy pursuant to the determination that a detainee is a danger to self or others, that\n14\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 15 of 25\n1 determination is not enough by itself to justify a search.  In such cases, where a plaintiff can\n2 show that the individual officer had not conducted the search based on reasonable suspicion\n3 (i.e. where the officer was unreasonable in finding that the detainee was a danger to self or\n4 others) there may be liability pursuant to section 1983.\n5 3.  Consent Searches\n6 Plaintiffs assert that the Department’s alleged practice of searching all individuals that\n7 provided consent to be strip searched is unconstitutional.  However, the Court need not reach\n8 this issue because, as defendants point out, none of the named plaintiffs have claimed that\n9 they were strip searched because they signed a consent form.    \n10 B.  Reasonable Suspicion as to Individual Plaintiffs \n11 1.  Plaintiffs Zern and Corneau\nt\nr\nu 12 In addition to their facial attack on the Department’s policy as a whole, plaintiffs ask\no\nC\n  13 in their motion for summary judgment that plaintiffs Jonah Zern and Marcie Corneau are\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 members of the class.  Specifically, plaintiffs challenge the claim that these two individuals\ns D ct of 15 were arrested on charges of violence.  \nte stri\na Di16 Zern was charged with a violation of California Penal Code section 148.10, which\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 describes the crime of: \nUnit or the 18 resist[ing] a peace officer in the discharge or attempt to discharge\nF any duty of his or her office or employment and [where the]\n19 willful resistance proximately causes death or serious bodily\ninjury to a peace officer \n20\nSee Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 705 (referring to statutory definition in the process of determining\n21\nwhether a particular charge is a charge of violence).  Plaintiffs claim that this charge is not\n22\nsufficient to provide reasonable suspicion because the statute does not require that the\n23\ninjuries to the officer result from force or violence.  \n24\nThe Ninth Circuit has held that “in some cases, the charge itself may give rise to\n25\nreasonable suspicion” Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 716 (citing Thompson 885 F.2d at 1447).  In\n26\nThompson the Court held that the charge of grand theft auto provided reasonable suspicion\n27\nbecause that crime is “sufficiently associated with violence.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447. \n28\nSimilarly, although a violation of Penal Code section 148.10 does not necessarily involve\n15\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 16 of 25\n1 force or violence, the crime is sufficiently related to violent conduct that the charge by itself\n2 justifies a strip search.\n3 The same is true with respect to plaintiff Corneau.  She was arrested and charged\n4 pursuant to California Penal Code section 243(e), which criminalizes a battery “committed\n5 against a spouse. . . .”  Battery is defined under California law as “any willful and unlawful\n6 use of force or violence upon the person of another.”  Cal. Penal Code § 242.  Once again,\n7 although plaintiffs may be correct that a violation of section 243(e) does not necessarily\n8 involve violence, the crime is sufficiently associated with violent criminal conduct to justify\n9 a strip search.\n10 Therefore, plaintiffs Zern and Corneau are not members of the class.  Defendants have\n11 renewed their earlier motion for summary judgment as to these plaintiffs.  Because the Court\nt\nr\nu 12 finds that the searches conducted on these individuals was based on reasonable suspicion, the\no\nC\n  13 motion is granted.\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 2.  Plaintiffs Bull, Mangosing and Timbrook\ns D ct of 15 As discussed above, even where the strip search policy was invalid a particular search\nte stri\na Di16 may still be found valid if the circumstances of the individual case created a reasonable\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 suspicion.  Plaintiffs contend that there is no basis for concluding that there was a reasonable\nUnit or the 18 suspicion as to plaintiffs Mary Bull, Miki Mangosing, and Laura Timbrook.  However,\nF\n19 plaintiffs Bull and Mangosing were each searched pursuant to the Department’s safety cell\n20 policy.  The Court previously noted that these types of searches are deeply grounded in the\n21 particular circumstances of the search and do not lend themselves easily to a broad brush\n22 approach.  Moreover, there is substantial evidence in the record from which a reasonable\n23 factfinder could conclude that both Bull and Mangosing were searched based on a reasonable\n24 suspicion that they might harm themselves or others.  For example an initial psychological\n25 report regarding Bull states that she was “completely out of touch with reality,” that “[s]he\n26 murmurs and smiles to herself very inappropriately,” that “she is not responding to contact,”\n27 and that she “[a]t times seems to be talking to someone invisible.”  A housing report\n28 regarding Mangosing states that she was “out of control.”  Accepting these accounts as true\n16\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 17 of 25\n1 and viewing them in the light most favorable to defendants, it is clear that summary judgment\n2 should not be granted as to whether reasonable suspicion existed to strip search these\n3 plaintiffs.\n4 However, the Court reaches a different conclusion with respect to plaintiff Timbrook. \n5 The record reveals that Timbrook was arrested pursuant to warrants for displaying a false\n6 identification, possession of a forged check with intent to defraud and burglary.  After arrest,\n7 Timbrook was classified for housing in the general jail population.  Defendant has not\n8 opposed the motion for summary judgment in Timbrook’s favor and the Court finds nothing\n9 in the record that would support the conclusion that there was reasonable individualized\n10 suspicion which supported the decision to strip search her.  As such, the motion is granted\n11 with respect to plaintiff Timbrook. \nt\nr\nu 12 C.  Qualified Immunity\no\nC\n  13 Sheriff Michael Hennessey moves for partial summary judgment on his defense of\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 qualified immunity, claiming that the law discussed above was not sufficiently clearly\ns D ct of 15 established at the time the policy was in effect and that he was reasonable in crafting it as he\nte stri\na Di16 did.  \nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 Qualified immunity protects “government officials . . . from liability for civil damages\nUnit or the 18 insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\nF\n19 of which a reasonable person would have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818\n20 (1982).  Qualified immunity operates “to ensure that before they are subjected to suit,\n21 officers are on notice their conduct is unlawful.”  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 206 (2001). \n22 In considering a claim of qualified immunity, a court must first determine whether the\n23 plaintiffs have alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right.  See id. at 201.  If\n24 they have, the court must then determine whether that right was clearly established at the\n25 time of the violation.  See id.   The relevant inquiry is whether it would be clear to a\n26 reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.  Id. at 202. \n27 The clearly established test is met if “‘in light of the pre-existing law the unlawfulness [is]\n28 apparent.’”  Galvin v. Hay, 361 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting Hope v. Pelzer, 536\n17\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 18 of 25\n1 U.S. 730, 739 (2002)).  Even if an officer’s actions violate a constitutional right, a reasonable\n2 but mistaken belief that his conduct was lawful would result in the grant of qualified\n3 immunity.  Wilkins v. City of Oakland, 350 F.3d 949, 955 (9th Cir. 2003).\n4 Here, Sheriff Hennessey is not protected by qualified immunity from a suit based on\n5 his decision to create a blanket policy of strip searching all individuals classified for housing\n6 in the general jail population.  As discussed above, the policy did violate plaintiffs’\n7 constitutional rights.  Moreover, the right was clearly established: in an unbroken line of\n8 precedent tracing back to 1984 the Ninth Circuit has reaffirmed the fundamental holding of\n9 Giles that a strip search of a pre-arraignment detainee must be supported by reasonable\n10 individualized suspicion.  It was also abundantly clear after Thompson that placement in the\n11 general jail population cannot “by itself cannot justify a strip search.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d\nt\nr\nu 12 at 1447.  Given this clear precedent, the Court finds that reasonable minds could not differ as\no\nC\n  13 to what the law required. \nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 The legal landscape was far different as to safety cell strip searches.  At the time the\ns D ct of 15 policy was made there was little if any authority regarding searches of mentally ill or\nte stri\na Di16 intoxicated detainees in a jail setting.  Although this Court finds that Giles provides\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 substantial guidance regarding how this question should be addressed, that precedent does\nUnit or the 18 not necessarily compel the result reached here.  Accordingly, the law regarding safety cell\nF\n19 searches was not clearly established and therefore Sheriff Hennessey’s motion is granted on\n20 this issue.\n21 D.  Monell Claims\n22 In their answer, defendants assert the affirmative defense that “[t]he complaint fails to\n23 state a federal civil rights claim against the defendants under the doctrine announced in\n24 Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978).”  Plaintiffs move for\n25 summary judgment that this defense is inapplicable.  \n26 In Monell, the Supreme Court held that if the “execution of a government’s policy or\n27 custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to\n28 represent official policy, inflicts the injury [then] the government as an entity is responsible\n18\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 19 of 25\n1 under § 1983.”  Id. at 694.  To establish such municipal liability, a plaintiff must satisfy four\n2 conditions: “(1) that [the plaintiff] possessed a constitutional right of which he was deprived; \n3 (2) that the municipality had a policy;  (3) that this policy ‘amounts to deliberate\n4 indifference’ to the plaintiff's constitutional right;  and (4) that the policy is the ‘moving\n5 force behind the constitutional violation.’”  Van Ort v. Estate of Stanewich, 92 F.3d 831, 835\n6 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Oviatt v. Pearce, 954 F.2d 1470, 1474 (9th Cir.1992) (citation\n7 omitted)).  \n8 It is clear that the Department’s policy requiring strip searches of all individuals\n9 classified for housing creates municipal liability under Monell.  Defendant has not contested\n10 this was an official written policy of the City and County of San Francisco.  Nor is there any\n11 dispute that the policy was the “moving force” behind the constitutional violations.  The\nt\nr\nu 12 policy clearly required individual officers to search all detainees classified for housing,\no\nC\n  13 without consideration of individualized suspicion.  The City and County of San Francisco is\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 therefore liable under Monell.  As such, plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on that\ns D ct of 15 issue is granted.\nte stri\na Di16 However, a closer analysis is necessary when considering whether CCSF is liable for\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 the safety cell strip search policy.  Plaintiffs have not presented evidence that the failure of\nUnit or the 18 the department to provide more specific restrictions on safety cell strip searches was the\nF\n19 “moving force” behind the alleged violations of the detainees’ constitutional rights.  Instead,\n20 plaintiffs claim that plaintiff Mary Bull was subjected to a safety cell strip search because she\n21 refused to submit to a “classification” strip search.  However, even accepting these\n22 allegations as true, such conduct would amount to a violation of the Department’s safety cell\n23 strip search policy and therefore would not create municipal liability.  See Henry v. County\n24 of Shasta, 132 F.3d 512, 521 (9th Cir. 1997) (suggesting that there is no Monell claim where\n25 the officers acted “in violation of the orders or policies that governed their conduct”). \n26 Plaintiffs also contend that Miki Mangosing was unconstitutionally strip searched after she\n27 was placed in a safety cell pursuant to a finding that she was a danger to herself.  However,\n28 the constitutionality of such a search would depend on whether the individual officers who\n19\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 20 of 25\n1 chose to place her in a safety cell had reasonable suspicion to believe that she was carrying\n2 concealed contraband.  It is therefore clear that in each of these cases if the search involved\n3 was unconstitutional, the proper defendant would be the individual officers who decided that\n4 the search should be conducted.  Under these circumstances, it is not enough that the\n5 Department left substantial discretion in the hands of the individual officers making safety\n6 cell placement determinations.  In order for there to be municipal liability, plaintiffs must\n7 show that the policy was a moving force behind the constitutional violations and that the\n8 Department’s decision not to further restrict officers’ discretion to order safety cell searches\n9 amounted to deliberate indifference on the part of the policymakers.  Plaintiffs’ have not\n10 made such a showing and therefore their motion for summary judgment on this issue is\n11 denied.\nt\nr\nu 12 E.  Other Affirmative Defenses\no\nC\n  13 Plaintiffs have also moved for summary judgment on defendants’ affirmative defenses\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 that the Sheriff is not a “person” liable under section 1983 and that the Sheriff is immune\ns D ct of 15 from exemplary and punitive damages.  Plaintiffs also ask for summary judgment with\nte stri\na Di16 respect to the affirmative defenses of estoppel, assumption of risk, and comparative\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 negligence.  Defendants have not opposed any of these motions and they are therefore\nUnit or the 18 granted.\nF\n19 III.  State Claims\n20 Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on their strip search claims under\n21 California Penal Code section 4030 and the California Constitution.   \n22 A.  Penal Code Section 4030\n23 California Penal Code Section 4030 makes unlawful and provides civil liability for\n24 certain classes of strip searches of pre-arraignment misdemeanor detainees. Defendants claim\n25 that insofar as some members of the class were strip searched after they were declared\n26 eligible for housing in the general jail population, such plaintiffs cannot state a claim for\n27 relief under section 4030.  The parties’ dispute in this regard centers on two portions of\n28 section 4030.  Subdivision (f) of the statute provides in pertinent part:\n20\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 21 of 25\n1 No person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or\ninfraction offense, except those involving weapons, controlled\n2 substances or violence . . . shall be subjected to a strip search or\nvisual body cavity search prior to placement in the general jail\n3 population, unless a peace officer has determined there is\nreasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts to\n4 believe such person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and a\nstrip search will result in the discovery of the weapon or\n5 contraband. \n6 (emphasis added).\n7 Subdivision (g) of section 4030 next provides that:\n8 [N]o person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or\ninfraction offense not involving weapons, controlled substances\n9 or violence, shall be confined in the general jail population unless\nall of the following are true: (i) The person is not cited and\n10 released[;] (ii) The person is not released on his or her own\nrecognizance pursuant to Article 9 (commencing with Section\n11 1318) of Chapter 1 of Title 10 of Part 2[;] (iii) The person is not\nt able to post bail within a reasonable time not less than three\nr\nu 12 hours.\no\nC\n  13 Relying on several statements in the legislative history, defendants take the position\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 that these two sections, when read together, allow a strip search to be performed either if\ns D ct of 15 there is reasonable suspicion or if the three conditions of subdivision (g) are met.  For\nte stri\na Di16 example, prior to the passage of the bill that became section 4030, the legislative counsel\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 concluded that\nUnit or the 18 [u]nder the proposed Section 4030 of the Penal Code, a person\nF may be strip searched prior to the actual placement of the person\n19 in the general jail population, after the requirements of\nsubdivision (g) for that placement have been met, without the\n20 need for compliance with the requirements of subdivision (f).\n21 “Strip Searches--#5001” Letter to Honorable Marian Bergeson from Ben E. Dale (Feb. 27,\n22 1984) available at 6 Cal. Assembly Journal 11304 (1983-84 Reg. Sess.).  Statements in the\n23 legislative history by the Senate, Assembly and the Governor at the time of passage adopt the\n24 view of the legislative counsel, thus lending further support to defendants’ interpretation.  \n25 Plaintiffs respond with a citation to the later opinion of the California Attorney\n26 General, which concludes that section 4030 prohibits warrantless pre-arraignment strip\n27 searches absent reasonable suspicion “prior to the placement of [the detainee] in the general\n28 population.”  See Cal. Att’y Gen. Opinion No. 88-1201 (July 6, 1989).  \n21\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 22 of 25\n1 The parties dispute arises out of the ambiguity of the phrase “prior to placement in the\n2 general jail population” that is used in subdivision (f) and repeated by the Attorney General’s\n3 opinion.  The term “placement” in this phrase could reasonably be interpreted to refer either\n4 to the physical delivery of a detainee to the “general jail” structure, or any number of points\n5 in time before then, although after the subdivision (g) requirements are met.  It is an accepted\n6 principle of statutory interpretation that given such ambiguity reference to the legislative\n7 history is allowed.  See Day v. City of Fontana, 25 Cal.4th 268, 272 (Cal. 2001); see\n8 generally Stephen Breyer, On the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes, 65 S.\n9 Cal. L. Rev. 845 (1992).  Here, the legislative history confirms that “placement” under the\n10 statute occurs at some time “prior to the actual placement of the person in the general jail\n11 population” (emphasis added), but at some point after the three prerequisites for jail\nt\nr\nu 12 confinement contained in subdivision (g) are met.  Thus the Court finds that section 4030 is\no\nC\n  13 not violated where a warrantless pre-arraignment strip search is performed without\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 reasonable suspicion prior to a detainee physically arriving in the general jail population.\ns D ct of 15 This, however, does not end the inquiry.  Some ambiguity remains regarding whether\nte stri\na Di16 a search may be performed on any prearraignment detainee who satisfies the three conditions\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 described in subdivision (g).  Defendant claims that these three factors are sufficient to\nUnit or the 18 justify a search under the statute.  The Court rejects this view.  If defendants were correct, the\nF\n19 statute would be reduced to nothing more than a three-hour waiting period for strip searches\n20 of any arrestee who is not able to post bail.  This is true because the nonoccurrence of the\n21 events described in subdivisions (g)(1) and (g)(2) is entirely within the control of the\n22 detaining officials.  Nothing in the legislative history requires such a sweeping result, and the\n23 clear text of the statute counsels against it.  The legislative counsel’s opinion states only that\n24 searches may be conducted “prior to . . . actual placement.”  This reasonable statement\n25 cannot be converted into the sweeping conclusion that satisfaction of the subdivision (g)\n26 factors alone is both necessary and sufficient to justify a search without reasonable suspicion. \n27 That view is contrary to the express intent of the statute to protect detainees’ civil rights by\n28 limiting strip searches.  See Cal. Penal Code § 4030(a) (“It is the intent of the Legislature in\n22\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 23 of 25\n1 enacting this section to protect the state and federal constitutional rights of the people of\n2 California . . . by strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches.”).  Rather than adopting this\n3 radical view,6 the Court instead finds that a search without reasonable suspicion may take\n4 place consistent with section 4030 after: (1) the three subdivision (g) conditions are met; and\n5 (2) the circumstances demonstrate that the individual detainee is actually destined for the\n6 general jail population absent some unexpected reason for release. \n7 Here, defendants have asserted that detainees assigned for housing were not strip\n8 searched until detainees were to be “dressed in” to attire appropriate for the general jail\n9 population.  Confirming this fact, after removing their own clothes and being strip searched,\n10 inmates were instructed to put on prison uniforms.  Assuming these facts are true, searches\n11 under these circumstances did not run afoul of section 4030.  \nt\nr\nu 12 B.  State Law Immunities\no\nC\n  13 Defendants next claim that the city is immune from liability under section 4030\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 because California Government Code section 844.67 provides immunity for public entities\ns D ct of 15 from suits brought by prisoners.  However, section 4030 was enacted several years after\nte stri\na Di16 section 844.6 and explicitly provides a private right of action for any detainee aggrieved by a\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 violation of the state.  See Cal. Penal Code § 4030(p).  Of course, there are only two classes\nUnit or the 18 of conceivable defendants in the civil suits contemplated by this private right of action:\nF\n19 public entities making strip search policies and individual officers executing such policies.   \n20 Thus to find that the earlier-enacted immunity prevails over the later-enacted cause of action\n21 would be to nullify at least half of the potential scope of the private cause of action. \n22\n23 6The Court also rejects plaintiffs’ view that subdivision (g) prohibits incorporation of an\ninmate into the general jail population prior to an O.R. hearing.  The clear text of the statute is\n24 to  the  contrary  and  requires  only  that  the  detainee  “is  not  released  on  his  or  her  own\nrecognizance pursuant to” Penal Code section 1318 et seq., which governs O.R. releases.  This\n25 language clearly requires only the nonoccurrence of an O.R. release, and creates no substantive\nrights to a hearing prior to housing in the general jail population.   \n26\n7The statute states: “(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, except as\n27 provided  in  this  section  and  in  Sections  814,  814.2,  845.4,  and  845.6,  or  in  Title  2.1\n(commencing with Section 3500) of Part 3 of the Penal Code, a public entity is not liable for:\n28 . . .  (2) An injury to any prisoner.”  Cal. Gov’t Code § 844.6.\n23\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 24 of 25\n1 However, the later statute is more specific and does not limit the suits to either of these\n2 classes of defendants.  The Court therefore concludes that immunity on these grounds does\n3 not apply.\n4 Defendants’ similar claim that Sheriff Hennessey is immune from liability under\n5 California Government Code section 820.28 also fails.  That statute opens with the\n6 qualification that it applies “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute.”  Cal. Gov’t Code §\n7 820.2.  As before, the more recent authorization of suit in section 4030 falls squarely within\n8 the statutory exception in section 820.2.  Therefore no immunity applies.\n9 C.  State Constitutional Claims\n10 Defendants claim that plaintiffs’ cause of action brought under the California\n11 Constitution’s privacy clause also fail.  Defendants state that in this context the California\nt\nr\nu 12 constitution’s privacy protection should be interpreted consistent with federal interpretations\no\nC\n  13 of Fourth Amendment protection.  See In re York, 9 Cal. 4th 1133, 1149 (1995).  Since the\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 Court has rejected the claim that blanket strip searches of all detainees entering the general\ns D ct of 15 jail population may be strip searched consistent with the Fourth Amendment, the same\nte stri\na Di16 argument must also be rejected here.  Further, defendant has cited no case in which the\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 statutory immunity created by Government Code section 844.6 was interpreted to be an\nUnit or the 18 available defense against a claim brought under the California Constitution’s privacy clause.\nF\n19 D.  Other Defenses\n20 Plaintiffs also moved for summary judgment with regard to several other of plaintiffs’\n21 affirmative defenses: that plaintiffs failed to satisfy claim presentment requirements; that\n22 defendants are immune as public employees engaged in the execution and enforcement of\n23 law under Government Code section 820.4; and that defendants are immune as third parties\n24 under Government Code section 820.8.  Defendants have not opposed these motions and they\n25 are therefore granted.\n26\n27 8The statute states: “Except as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is not\nliable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result\n28 of the exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.”  Cal.\nGov’t Code § 820.2.\n24\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220      Filed 09/22/2005     Page 25 of 25\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 For the foregoing reasons, the Court rules as follows:\n3 1. Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment is GRANTED IN PART and\n4 DENIED IN PART.\n5 2. Defendant Sheriff Hennessey’s motion for summary judgment regarding qualified\n6 immunity is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n7 3.

In doing the acts alleged, \n6  these officers were acting under color of law within the course and scope of their \n7  employment by the Defendant City And County Of San Francisco.

Defendants San Francisco County Sheriff’s Deputies sued herein by their \n10  fictitious  names  (Does  36  through  100)  are sheriff’s deputies who, as part of their \n11  duties at the San Francisco Jails stripped Plaintiff of her clothing without any reasonable \n12  or lawful basis and then placed her, without clothing, in a “cold room” where she was \n13  viewed by other Jail personnel.

Shortly  after  midnight  on  March  28,  2003, Plaintiff Deborah Flick was \n25  standing  near  the  intersection  of  Fillmore  and  Union  Streets  in  the  City  of  San \n26  Francisco, California.   \n27  12.  As Flick was walking to her car that was parked on the street, a man \n28  began to harass her.  She ignored him and continued to her car.  The unknown man \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Flick ignored him, knowing she was not intoxicated.  Flick \n3  got into her car and attempted to call her boyfriend from her cell phone to let him know \n4  she was heading home. \n5  13.  Suddenly,  two  male  San  Francisco  Police  Department  officers  began \n6  pounding on the window of  Plaintiff’s car.  She rolled the window down slightly and \n7  asked what was wrong.  She explained that a  man had been harassing her, that she \n8  had done nothing wrong, that she was fine, and they should be speaking with the man \n9  who had harassed her.  The officers pounded on her window yelling “you think  that \n10  because  you’re  pretty  and  a  rich  bitch,  you  can  do  whatever  you  want.”    Plaintiff \n11  became frightened and dialed 911 because she was alarmed by the officers’ conduct.    \n12  14.  The officers then yanked Plaintiff’s car door open, dragged her into the \n13  street  and  handcuffed  her.    After  Plaintiff  complained,  the  officers  tightened  the \n14  handcuffs,  and  threw  Plaintiff  into  the  police  car.    Plaintiff  was  so  frightened  she \n15  urinated in her pants.  \n16  15.  Although lacking any reasonable cause to detain or arrest Plaintiff, police \n17  officers transported her to San Francisco County Jail No. 9.   \n18  16.  Plaintiff  eventually  was  advised  that  she  had  been  arrested  for  public \n19  intoxication, but no officer or deputy administered a sobriety test.   \n20  17.  Police  officers  neither  prepared  nor  filed  any  report  setting  forth  the \n21  events of Plaintiff’s arrest and/or detention.  \n22  18.  No citation or any criminal charges were filed against Plaintiff.  \n23  19.

Following  Plaintiff’s arrival at the County Jail, sheriff’s deputies, and/or \n2  other jail personnel,  acting under color of law, pursuant to the policies of Defendants \n3  City and County of San Francisco and the Sheriff of the County of San Francisco, and \n4  within the scope of their employment, held  Plaintiff down while other sheriff’s deputies \n5  and/or other jail personnel forcibly removed all of Plaintiff’s clothes.   \n6  21.  Plaintiff did not possess contraband and was not engaged in any conduct \n7  threatening to herself or to others. \n8  22.  Sheriff’s deputies and/or other jail personnel were aware that Plaintiff had \n9  not committed any crime punishable as a felony. \n10  23.  Sheriff’s deputies and/or jail personnel threw Plaintiff into the “cold room” \n11  in the San Francisco County Jail and left her there naked. \n12  24.  Male and female sheriff’s deputies and other jail personnel were able to \n13  look into the room and did in fact look into the “cold room” and saw her naked. \n14  25.  Those  actions  permitted  sheriff’s  deputies  and  other  jail  personnel  to \n15  visually inspect Plaintiff’s breasts, buttocks, and genitalia. \n16  26.  While in the “cold room”  Plaintiff started cramping and bleeding, but the \n17  sheriff’s deputies and other personnel responsible for her detention refused to give her \n18  clothes or a pad for her bleeding. \n19  27.  She  was  lying  naked  on  the  dirty floor in the “cold room”  and feared \n20  developing an infection.   \n21  28.  Plaintiff spent several hours alone in the “cold room” bleeding and  being \n22  subjected to continual verbal harassment.   \n23  29.  While in the jail facility,  Plaintiff was not permitted to make a telephone \n24  call. \n25  30.  Plaintiff was released later that morning. \n26  31.

At all times relevant to the allegations of this complaint, Plaintiff Deborah \n14 \nFlick was protected by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution against \n15 \nseizure, arrest, transportation, detention and imprisonment without reasonable cause. \n16 \n36.  The  actions  of  San  Francisco  Police  Officers  in  seizing,  arresting, \n17 \ndetaining,  transporting  and imprisoning Plaintiff under color of law  violated Plaintiff’s \n18 \nrights  guaranteed  to  her  by  the  Fourth  Amendment  to  be  free  from  unreasonable \n19 \nseizure, arrest, transportation, detention and imprisonment. \n20 \n37.
