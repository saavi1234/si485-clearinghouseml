    "summary": "<p>On May 1, 2000, a female plaintiff represented by attorney Howard Friedman of Boston, along with other counsel, filed a civil rights class action lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The lawsuit challenged the strip search policy of the Plymouth County Regional Lockup Facility at the Marshfield Police Department.  Plaintiffs alleged that the Plymouth County Sheriff had a blanket strip search policy whereby all women detained as \"safe-keeps\" (pre-arraignment detainees, those held on warrants and those in protective custody) in the Lockup Facility were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches, without any reasonable suspicion that the women possessed contraband or weapons.  In addition to Plymouth County and its Sheriff, plaintiffs named as defendants the town of Marshfield, which leased jail space to the County, and the towns of Hanover and Rockland, which sent detainees to the Lockup Facility.   Plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive monetary damages and class certification.  All defendants denied the allegations.</p><p>The parties consented to having the case tried by Magistrate Judge Robert B. Collings.  An amended complaint was filed on July 2, 2001, which added claims for women who were strip searched before special arraignment sessions at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (\"PCCF\").  Judge Collings certified the case as a class action on October 1, 2001, establishing two sub-classes:  the Marshfield sub-class consisting of women who were strip searched at a Lockup Facility, and the Plymouth County Correctional Facility sub-class consisting of women who were strip searched before special arraignment sessions at a count jail.  It was estimated that there were approximately 700 female class members.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the Town of Hanover and Town of Rockland.  </p><p>On November 14, 2003, Judge Collings preliminarily approved a settlement and set the matter for a fairness hearing.  Final approval was granted on March 11, 2004.  Under the terms of the settlement, Plymouth County and the Town of Marshfield agreed to pay $1.35 million into a settlement fund to resolve all class claims.  From the fund, the Court awarded class counsel $429,000 for attorney's fees (33%), $8,359 for litigation costs (.64%), and $25,632 for claims administration expenses (1.97%), representing 35.61% of the total settlement fund.   The Court also approved $7,500 to each of the four class representatives and $3,500 to one class member who assisted class counsel for a total of $33,500 in incentive awards.   A total of 105 claim forms, representing 133 total claims, were approved (28 class members were in both sub-classes), with a participation rate of 15%.  Marshfield class members received $5,859 and PCCF class members received $7,705.  Claimants received an award for just one strip search.  Settlement administration continued through 2005.</p><p></p>",

INTRODUCTION \nThe parties, by counsel, have entered into this Settlement Agreement, which they \nsubmit to the Court for approval. This agreement provides for the defendants to settle \nthe plaintiffs' claims for $1.35 million, to be shared among participating class members \nafter payment of class representative bonuses, administration and litigation expenses, \nand attorney's fees. \nII.  BACKGROUND \n1.  The plaintiffs filed this action on May 1, 2000. \n2.  On September 21, 2001, this Court certified this case as a class action \npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3), with the following sub-classes: \na.  Marshfield Sub-Class: women who were taken to the Plymouth \nCounty Regional Lockup Facility located in the Marshfield Police \nStation  for  detention  and  strip  searched  without  determining \nwhether there was individualized reasonable suspicion for the strip \nsearch; and/or \n\n--------------------------------------- ------- ----------\nb.  PCCF Sub-Class: women who were taken to the Plymouth County \nCorrectional Facility for arraignment where they were strip searched \nwithout determining whether there was individualized reasonable \nsuspicion for the strip search. \n3.  The Marshfield sub-class period runs from May 20, 1997, when the facility \nopened, through January 31, 2000, the last day before the county implemented a written \npolicy ending automatic strip searches. The PCCF sub-class period runs from February \n23, 1998, when the arraignment session began there, through October 11, 1999, the last \nday before a written notation was made in the matron's log that pre-arraignment strip \nsearches would no longer take place. \n4.  For the purposes of this case, the term \"strip search\" includes any exposure \nor observation of a portion of a person's body where that person had a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy. \n5.  After the class was certified, an approved class action notice was sent to \nevery potential class member at her last known address. Eight class members asked to \nbe excluded by the deadline. They will not be sent settlement notices. \nIII.  COURT SUPERVISION \n6.  The Court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement and may enter orders \nas appropriate to enforce it, to adjudicate the rights and responsibilities of the parties, \nand to effect fair and orderly administration. \n7.  Any deadlines, dates, or other details in this Settlement Agreement may be \nchanged by the Court on a showing of good cause. \n2 \n\n-------------------------------- -------------------\nIV.  HEARING \n8.  The Court will hold a hearing on October 31, 2003 to decide whether to \ngrant preliminary approval to the settlement. If preliminary approval is granted, the \nparties will begin to implement the settlement. The defendants will make their payment, \nand the plaintiffs will send the approved notice to the class. \n9.  The Court will hold the final fairness hearing to decide whether to grant \nfinal approval to the settlement. \nV.  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FUNDS \n10.  The defendants, collectively, will pay one million three hundred and fifty \nthousand dollars ($1,350,000.00) to settle all claims brought by the plaintiffs in this \naction. \n11.  The defendants will each pay their respective share of the settlement \namounts by check made out to the \"Connor Settlement Fund\" and delivered to class \ncounsel no later than 12:00 noon on the seventh day following the Court's order \ngranting preliminary approval. \n12.  If any defendant does not pay all or part of its obligation on time, the \namount owed by that defendant will  accrue  interest at the rate of 12% per year, \ncompounded daily. The obligation to pay interest will apply only to the defendant that \nfailed to pay its obligation in full. Interest will only apply to the unpaid portion of the \ndefendants' obligation. \n3 \n\n---------------------------~-----\n13.  Class counsel will deposit the money into two interest-earning escrow \naccounts at LaSalle Bank National Association (135 South LaSalle Street, Suite 1960, \nChicago,  Illinois).  Of the  money,  70.59%  ($952,965)  will  be  deposited  for  the \nMarshfield sub-class; the principal plus all accrued interest will comprise the \"Marshfield \nFund.\" The remaining 29.41 % ($397,035) will be deposited for the PCCF sub-class; the \nprincipal plus all accrued interest will comprise the \"PCCF Fund.\" These percentages are \nbased on the formula agreed to in mediation.  These funds will be invested in the \nDreyfus Government Cash Management Fund or other money market funds similarly \ncomposed of instruments secured by the full faith and credit of the United States. \n14.  If the Court does not give final approval to the settlement, the plaintiffs \nwill return the amounts paid to the defendants. \n15.  If the Court does approve the settlement, the Marshfield Fund and the \nPCCF Fund will belong to the plaintiffs, and the defendants will no longer have any \nright to, title to, or interest in the funds. \nVI.  CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR AND SPECIAL MASTER \n16.  Class counsel will recommend that the firm of Blackman Kallick Bartelstein \nLLP (300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 660, Chicago, Illinois) be approved by the Court \nas Claims Administrator. \n17.  Class  counsel  recommends  that attorney  Robert  J.  Berks (Brockton, \nMassachusetts) be approved by the Court as Special Master for the purpose of hearing \n4 \n\nappeals of decisions by the claims administrator regarding class membership and for \ndistributing checks to class members who elect to pick up their checks. \n18.  Class  counsel will  oversee  settlement administration and will provide \ndirection to the Claims Administrator and Special Master as needed. \nVII.  NOTICE, OBJECTIONS, AND CLAIMS \n19.  Class counsel will send a Notice of Class Action Settlement and of the \nHearing to Approve the Settlement (\"Notice of Settlement\"), a Settlement Claim Form, \na Frequently Asked Questions sheet, and a confirmation card, by first class mail postage \nprepaid to all potential class members at their last known addresses no later than 21 \ndays after the Court's order granting preliminary approval. If any mail is returned by the \npost office with notice of a more current address, class counsel will resend the notice to \nthat address. Class counsel is not required to make any further efforts to send mail \ndirectly to class members. \n20.  The Notice of Settlement will include the terms of the settlement and the \nclass member's right to contest the settlement. The proposed Notice of Settlement is \nattached as Exhibit A. \n21.  The  Settlement  Claim  Form  requests  the  class  member's contact \ninformation, affirmation that she meets the class definition, instructions for  check \ndelivery, and a Form W-9. The proposed Settlement Claim Form and Form W-9 is \nattached as Exhibit B. \n5 \n\n22.  The confirmation card, if properly completed by the claimant, will be date-\nstamped and remaileduponreceiptbytheClaimsAdministrator.This will inform class \nmembers that their Settlement Claim Form was received by the Claims Administrator. \n23.  The Frequently Asked Questions sheet will explain the settlement terms \nand answer anticipated questions. This form is attached as Exhibit C. \n24.  Class counsel will also publish notice of the settlement in The Brockton \nEnterprise. This notice is attached as Exhibit D. \n25.  In order for a class member to claim a share of the settlement, she must \nsubmit a valid and complete Settlement Claim Form postmarked no later than 90 days \nafter the Court's order granting preliminary approval.  This deadline is  the \"Claims \nDeadline. \" \n26.  In order for a class member to object to the proposed settlement, she must \nfirst submit to the Claims Administrator a letter of objection postmarked no later than \n90 days after the Court's order granting preliminary approval. She must then appear in \nperson or through counsel at the final fairness hearing to have her objection considered \nby the Court. The Claims Administrator will forward all letters of objection to the Court \nand to counsel for all parties. (The class member must also submit a Settlement Claim \nForm if she wishes to be eligible to share in the settlement should it be approved despite \nher objection.) \n6 \n\n27.  Settlement Claim Forms received by the Claims Administrator no later \nthan 14 days after the Claims Deadline will be treated as if postmarked by the Claims \nDeadline. This 14-day grace is the Amnesty Period. \n28.  In order for  a class member to file  a claim after the expiration of the \nAmnesty Period, she must petition directly to the Court for permission to file late and \nmust establish excusable neglect. The Court will consider only petitions received by the \nCourt no more than 30 days after the Amnesty Period. \nVIII.  APPROVAL AND APPEALS \n29.  The Claims Administrator will verify whether each claimant is  a class \nmember by confirming (a) that her Settlement Claim Form is timely and valid, (b) that \nthe information on the form is consistent with the booking information provided by the \ndefendants, and (c) that she affirms that she meets the class definition. \n30.  For any claimant who cannot be verified as a class member, the Claims \nAdministrator will send a Notice of Claim Denial to the claimant no more than 14 days \nafter the Court grants final approval of the settlement. \n31.  In order to object to the Claims Administrator's determination that she is \nnot a  class  member,  a  claimant must file  a written appeal  to the  Special  Master \npostmarked no later than 14 days after the date of the mailing of her Notice of Claim \nDenial. She must include a written statement and documentation that shows that she \nis a class member. The evidence may include her criminal offender's record information \n(CORI) or certified Court documents from her criminal case. A claimant who has used \n7 \n\n----------------------_._---- ----------\nan alias must prove that she used such an alias. The Special Master may rule using the \ndocumentary evidence or may require the class member to attend a hearing. The Special \nMaster will  make a determination on any appeals  no later than 30 days  after the \ndeadline for class members to file  such appeals. The Special Master will report the \ndetermination to the Claims Administrator and class counsel. The Claims Administrator \nwill inform the class members of the Special Master's determination. Rulings by the \nSpecial Master will be final and binding. \n32.  The Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Approval and Sub-\nClass Membership (\"Notice of Claim Approval\") to each approved claimant no more \nthan 14 days after the Court grants final approval of the settlement. The Notice of \nClaim Approval will tell each claimant her membership status in each sub-class and an \nestimate of her settlement amount. \n33.  A class member may contest a decision that she is a member of only one \nsub-class.  In order to do so,  she must file  a written appeal to the Special  Master \npostmarked no later than 14 days after the date of the mailing of her Notice of Claim \nApproval. She must include a written statement and documentation that shows that she \nis a member of the other sub-class. A claimant who has used an alias must prove that she \nused the alias. The Special Master may rule using just the documentary evidence or may \nrequire  the  class  member  to  attend  a  hearing.  The  Special  Master will  make  a \ndetermination on each woman's appeal no later than 60 days after the deadline for class \nmembers to file such appeals. The Special Master will report the determination to the \n8 \n\nClaims Administrator and class counsel; the Claims Administrator will inform the class \nmember in writing of the Special Master's determination. Rulings by the Special Master \nwill be final and binding. Each claimant who loses such an appeal will be penalized at \nthe time of settlement distribution by a deduction of 20% of the amount of her award. \nThe deducted amount will be redistributed amongst members of the sub-class who did \nnot lose appeals. \n34.  If any claimants successfully appeal claim denial or get permission from the \nCourt to file  a claim after the Claims Deadline, they will go through a similar but \nexpedited process of class membership determination, notification, and opportunity to \nappeal. The Claims Administrator will set reasonable deadlines to balance fairness to the \nlate claimant with the interest of class members in a prompt distribution. \nIX.  EXPENSES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES \n35.  Administrative  costs,  including  the  Claims  Administrator's  fees and \nexpenses and the Special Masters' fees and expenses, will be paid from the settlement \nfunds  subject to approval by the Court. Class counsel will submit requests for the \napproval of such costs from time to time. \n36.  Class counsel will ask the Court to approve payment of plaintiffs' litigation \nexpenses from the settlement funds to be paid at the same time as the distribution of the \nsettlement funds to the class members. \n9 \n\n------------------------------ -------------\n37.  Class counsel will ask the Court to approve an attorney's fee of 31 % of the \ndefendants' total payment and all accrued interest, to be calculated and paid at the same \ntime as the distribution of the settlement funds to class members. \n38.  Administrative costs, litigation expenses, and attorney's fees will be paid \nin the followng proportion: 70.59% will be paid from the Marshfield Fund and 29.41 % \nwill be paid from the PCCF Fund. \nX.  DISTRIBUTION TO CLASS MEMBERS \n39.  The Claims Administrator will pay bonuses from the settlement funds to \ncompensate class representatives and one class member who spent time working with \nclass counsel and attended the mediation to achieve the settlement. These checks will \nbe issued at the same time as payments to class members. Class representatives will each \nreceive bonuses of $7,500. Class member Aisling Sutton will receive a bonus of $3,500 \nfor participating in the mediation. Of these bonuses, 70.59% will be paid from the \nMarshfield Fund and 29.41 % will be paid from the PCCF Fund. \n40.  The Claims Administrator will make a final calculation of distribution \namounts after all appeals have been resolved. \n41.  The Claims Administrator will calculate the amount of money in each \nsettlement fund available to be distributed to class members after payment of bonuses, \nadministrative costs, litigation expenses, and attorney's fees, and after setting aside a \nCourt-approved amount to pay for post-distribution administrative costs. The Claims \n10 \n\n-------------------------------~~ ~~ ---\nAdministrator will calculate each participating class member's share by dividing the \navailable Marshfield Fund money equally amongst the participating Marshfield sub-class \nmembers and the available PCCF Fund money equally amongst the participating PCCF \nFund sub-class members. \n42.  Each class member's check will be made payable only in her name or in the \nname of her estate. The check will be mailed to her or will be held for her to pick up at \nthe office of the Special Master. \n43.  If a participating class  member asks to pick up her check or does not \nprovide a mailing address, or if the settlement check is returned as undeliverable, the \nclass member will be required to appear in person before the Special Master to present \nverification of her identity. \n44.  The  Special  Master  will  determine  the  time  and  place  for pickup. \nParticipating class members who pick up a check in person must present one of the \nfollowing forms of identification to establish their identity: (a) a driver's license or a \nstate identification card, (b) a passport or a green card, or (c) some other photographic \nidentification  card  not  readily  subject  to  forgery  such  as  a  military  or  student \nidentification card. Other forms of similarly reliable identification may be considered by \nthe Special Master. \nII \n\n45.  If a participating class member is confined in a prison, hospital, or other \ninstitution and has  provided the address of such institution for  her payment, the \nsettlement check will be sent to that address. \nXI.  POST-DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION \n46.  Class members will be informed that all settlement checks must be cashed \nwithin 90 days. If any settlement check is not cashed or not claimed by the time the \nsettlement fund accounts are closed, which will be more than 90 days after the date of \ndistribution,  the funds  will  be  sent to the State Treasury in accordance with the \nMassachusetts Abandoned Property Act. The class member or her legal representative \nmay later claim the money from the Treasurer pursuant to 960 C.M.R. 4.04. \n47.  LaSalle Bank will prepare all  1099s for class members who received a \nsettlement check during the bank's next regular tax-form processing period following the \ndistribution. The Claims Administrator will prepare all other necessary tax forms relating \nto the settlement fund account. \n48.

This is a civil rights action for money damages against Plymouth County, its \nSheriff Peter Forman, Plymouth County matrons Jane Doe and Jane Roe, the Town of \nMarshfield, the Town of Hanover and the Town of Rockland for injuries caused by the \nunconstitutional strip searches of the plaintiffs. \n2.  The named plaintiff, Kimberly Connor, seeks to represent a class  of all \nwomen who were held at the Plymouth County Regional Lockup Facility at the Marshfield \npolice station as \"safe-keeps.\"  Safe-keeps include pre-arraignment detainees who were \nwaiting for bail to be set or for an initial court appearance, women who were arrested on \nCD \n\n2 \ndefault warrants and women who were held in protective custody.  These women were \nunlawfully subjected to routine strip searches at the Plymouth County Regional Lockup \nFacility at the Marshfield Police Department due to a formal written policy implemented \nby the Plymouth County Sheriffs Department. These searches were conducted routinely, \nwithout any reason to suspect a strip search or a visual body cavity search was necessary. \n3.  The Town of Marshfield is sued because it acted jointly with the Plymouth \nCounty Sheriffs Department in violating the constitutional rights of women.  Under an \nagreement with the Plymouth County Sheriffs Department, it offered its facilities at the \nMarshfield police station to the Sheriff to use it as a Regional Lockup Facility for women \narrested in towns located within the County of Plymouth.  Plymouth County Sheriffs \nDepartment matrons \"report[ ed] directly to the Marshfield Officer- in-Charge\" upon arrival \nat the Marshfield Police Department. \n4.  The  Towns  of  Hanover  and  Rockland  are  sued  for  violating the \nconstitutional rights of women because, under their policies, all women who were held in \ncustody overnight were to be transferred to the Plymouth County Regional  Lockup \nFacility at Marshfield Police Department where they were to be routinely subjected to \nstrip searches while men who were held in custody overnight were kept in the towns' \nholding cells and were not subjected to such searches as a matter of routine. These Towns \nknew of, sanctioned and participated in Plymouth County Sheriffs Department's strip \nsearch policy, practice and custom, and have adopted it as their own for their female pre \narraignment detainees. \n\n3 \nJURISDICTION \n5.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.c. ยงยง1983 and 1988 and the \nFourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \nJurisdiction is founded upon 28 U.S.c. ยงยง1331 and 1343. \nPARTIES \n6.  The named plaintiff, Kimberly Connor, was at all times relevant to this \ncomplaint a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. \n7.  The  defendant  Plymouth  County  is  a  duly  designated  county  in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, under the laws of the Commonwealth. \n8.  The defendant Peter Forman was at all times relevant to this complaint the \nSheriff of Plymouth County.  He is  sued in his individual capacity.  The actions of \ndefendant Forman alleged in this complaint were taken under color of law. \n9.  The defendant Town of Marshfield is a duly organized municipal corporation \nin the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. \n10.  The defendant Jane Doe is a matron employed by Plymouth County.  She \nis sued in her individual capacity. \nII.  The defendant Jane Roe is a matron employed by Plymouth County.  She \nis sued in her individual capacity. \n12.  The actions of defendants Jane Doe and Jane Roe alleged in this complaint \nwere taken under color of the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Plymouth \nCounty. \n\\ \n\n4 \n13.

The defendant Town of Rockland is a duly organized municipal corporation \nin the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. \nFACTS \n15.  On April 30,  1998, plaintiff IGmberly Connor was arrested by Hanover \npolice officers. \n16.  Ms. Connor was taken to the Hanover police station where she was booked \nand fingerprinted. \n17.  Plaintiff was then told that she would be transferred to the Marshfield Police \nDepartment because the Hanover Police Department does not maintain female arrestees \nin custody. \n18.  Plaintiff was then handcuffed and taken in a Hanover police cruiser to the \nMarshfield police station. \n19.  When plaintiff arrived at Marshfield police station, defendant Doe brought \nplaintiff to a holding cell and ordered her to take off all of her clothing. \n20.  Ms. Connor was too scared to protest. \n21.  Ms. Connor complied with the order and took off all her clothing.  Then \ndefendant Doe searched plaintiff's clothing. \n22.  Defendant Doe next ordered plaintiff to squat ano. cough. \n23.  Defendant Doe had no reason to suspect that plaintiff had any weapons or \ncontraband hidden on her person. \n\n5 \n24.  After the search, plaintiff was left in the cell alone. \n25.  Later in the morning, plaintiff was taken to the Hingham District Court for \narraignment. \n26.  On April 10, 1999 at approximately 10:00 p.m., plaintiff Kimberly Connor \nwas arrested by Rockland police officers. \n27.  Ms. Connor was taken to the Rockland police station where she was booked \nand fingerprinted. \n28.  Ms. Connor was then taken to a holding cell where a female employee of the \nRockland police department ordered her to lift up her shirt, then the bra and shake it.  The \ncell did not have a door, only bars, and was immediately across from an open stairwell. \n29.  Plaintiff complied with the orders. \n30.  At  approximately  2:00  a.m.,  Ms.  Connor was  told  that  she would be \ntransferred to the Marshfield Police Department because the Rockland Police Department \ndoes not keep female arrestees overnight. \n31.  Plaintiff was then handcuffed and taken in a Rockland police cruiser to the \nMarshfield police station. \n32.  When plaintiff arrived at Marshfield police station, defendant Roe brought \nplaintiff to a holding cell and ordered her to take off all of her clothing. \n33.  Ms.  Connor  complied  with  the  orders  and  took  off  all her clothing. \nDefendant Roe searched plaintiff's clothing. \n34.  Defendant Roe then ordered Ms. Connor to squat and cough. \n\n6 \n35.  Defendant Roe had no reason to suspect that plaintiff had any weapons or \ncontraband hidden on her person. \n36.  Less than a half hour after the strip search, Ms. Connor was released on \n$25.00 bail. \n37.  Plaintiff suffered extreme emotional distress as a result of the strip searches \nas  described above conducted at the Marshfield police station.  She felt humiliated, \ndegraded and violated. \n38.  The strip searches of plaintiff by defendants Doe and Roe conformed to the \nwritten policy of the Plymouth County Sheriff's Department. \n39.  Plymouth  County  Sheriff's  Department  policy  PCCF  401 stated, \"All \ninmates,  including  transfers,  safe-keeps,  court  returns,  hospital  returns  and  new \ncommitments will be pat-frisked and strip-searched upon entry or reentry to the facility.\" \n40.  The policy of the Plymouth County Sheriff's Department required a routine \nstrip search, without evaluating whether a strip search was necessary. \n41.  The policy of the Plymouth County Sheriff s Department applied regardless \nof the length of time the person was to be held or of the charges lodged against the person. \n42.  Pursuant to an agreement between the Plymouth County and the Town of \nMarshfield, the Town offered its lockups at its police station to Plymouth County to be \nused as a Regional Lockup Facility for women arrested in towns located within Plymouth \nCounty. \n\n7 \n43.  Plymouth County Sheriff's Department matrons \"report[ed] directly to the \nMarshfield Officer-in-Charge\" upon arrival at the Marshfield Police Department. \n44.  Pursuant. to  an  agreement  between  the  Plymouth  County Sheriff's \nDepartment, the Town of Marshfield and the Towns of Hanover and Rockland, the \nPlymouth  County  Sheriff's  Department held  all  women who  were  pre-arraignment \ndetainees as \"safe-keeps\" at the Marshfield Police Department. \n45.  The Plymouth County Sheriff's Department conducted strip searches of all \nwomen who were admitted to their custody at the Marshfield Police Department. \n46.  Female prisoners were not held overnight at the Hanover Police station. \n47.  Female prisoners were not held overnight at the Rockland Police station. \n48.  When female prisoners arrived at the Plymouth County Regional Lockup \nFacility at Marshfield Police Station, they were subjected to a routine strip search as \ndescribed above. \n49.  It was the policy of the Hanover and  Rockland Police Departments to hold \nmale prisoners in holding cells at their respective stations until their first appearance in \ncourt. \n50.  Male arrestees who were similarly situated to the female safe-keeps were held \nin the Hanover or Rockland police stations and were not subjected to a routine strip \nsearch. \n\n8 \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n51.  This action is brought pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(l) and (3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure by plaintiff as a class action on behalf of all women who were: \na.  taken into custody by the Plymouth County Sheriffs Department at \nthe Marshfield police station as a safe-keep; and \nb.  subjected to a routine strip search at the Marshfield Police Station \nwithout evaluating whether there was cause for the search. \n52.  The named plaintiff, Kimberly Connor, is a member of the class.  The class \nrepresented by the plaintiff is so numerous that joinder of all such persons is impractical. \nOn information and belief, the number of class  members is  more than one hundred \nwomen. \n53.  There are  questions  of law and fact  which are  common to the class  of \nplaintiffs.  Central to all the claims is the constitutionality of the policy, practice or custom \nof the Plymouth County Sheriff to routinely conduct strip searches of female safe-keeps. \n54.  Plaintiff's claims or defenses are typical of the claims or defenses of the class \nof plaintiffs. \n55.  Plaintiff will fairly and accurately represent and protect the interests of the \nmembers of the class.  The attorney for plaintiff is experienced and capable in civil rights \nlitigation and has successfully represented plaintiffs in other civil rights litigation including \ncases  alleging  unlawful  strip  searches.  Counsel  has  the  resources  and  expertise  to \nprosecute this action. \n\n9 \n56.  This action is properly maintained as a class action because the prosecutions \nof separate  actions  by the individual  members  of the  class  would  create  a  risk of \ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class, \nwhich would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the defendants. \n57.  This  action  is  properly  maintainable  as  a  class  action  because  the \nprosecutions of separate actions would create a risk of adjudications with respect to \nindividual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the \ninterests of the other members who are not parties or substantially impair or impede their \nability to protect their interests. \n58.  As a direct result of the policies as described above, class members have been \nsubjected to unlawful strip searches which has caused each member of the class to endure \npain and suffering and mental anguish. \nFIRST COUNT: 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: DEFENDANT PLYMOUTH COUNTY \n59.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein. \n60.  The policy of the Plymouth County Sheriff's Department regarding strip \nsearches directed its officers to conduct searches that violated the United States Constitution. \n61.

      "title": "Plaintiffs' Assented Motion to Amend the Class Definitions [Granted on 02-25-2004]",
      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n__________________________________________\n)\nKIMBERLEY CONNOR, et al., )\nPlaintiffs )\n)\nv. ) Civil Action No. 00-10835-RBC\n)\nPLYMOUTH COUNTY, et al., )\nDefendants )\n_________________________________________ )\n \nPLAINTIFFSโ ASSENTED TO MOTION \nTO AMEND THE CLASS DEFINITIONS\nThe plaintiffs move this Court to amend the class definitions to add time periods\nto each Sub-Class so that the class definition will conform to the Settlement Agreement.\nThe proposed class definition is as follows:\na.  Marshfield Sub-Class: women who were taken to the Plymouth County\nRegional Lockup Facility located in the Marshfield Police Station for\ndetention and strip searched without determining whether there was\nindividualized reasonable suspicion for the strip search between May 20,\n1997 and January 31, 2000.\nb.  PCCF  Sub-Class:  women  who  were  taken  to  the  Plymouth County\nCorrectional  Facility  for  arraignment  where  they  were  strip  searched\nwithout determining whether there was individualized reasonable suspicion\nfor the strip search between February 23, 1998 and October 11, 1999.\nAs grounds for this motion, plaintiffs state the following:\n1.  This court is authorized to alter or amend a class ruling at any time before\nfinal judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1). \n2.  The proposed class definitions begin when the Regional Lockup Facility at\nMarshfield Police Station (โMarshfield lockupโ) and the Plymouth County Correctional\n\nFacility (โPCCFโ) each began operation and end when the County formally changed its\npolicy or custom of suspicionless strip searches at each facility. \n3.  The class definition as certified by this Court on September 21, 2001 did\nnot include any time periods because the motion was filed before plaintiffs learned\nthrough discovery when the policy, practice or custom of strip searching without cause\nstarted and ended. \n4.  The plaintiffs learned through discovery that on May 20, 1997, the\nMarshfield lockup opened and that Plymouth County  changed  its written policy\neffective February 1, 2000, ending the policy of conducting suspicionless strip searches\nof women who were held at the Marshfield lockup. \n5.  The plaintiffs also learned that on February 23, 1998, the County began\nits arraignment program at the PCCF and determined that pre-arraignment suspicionless\nstrip searches ended as the official policy or custom at the PCCF on October 12, 1999\nwhen a written notice was placed in the matronโs journal noting that women were no\nlonger to be strip searched before bail hearings.\n6.  If  any  women  were  strip  searched  without  individualized reasonable\nsuspicion at the Marshfield lockup after February 1, 2000 or at the PCCF after October\n12, 1999, they would not have a complaint that could be addressed in this class action\nbecause it was not caused by the common policies. This class action is based on the\nclaim that the Countyโs policies or customs were the moving force behind the strip\nsearches. This allegation could no longer be made after the County formally acted to end\n\nthe policy or custom. Thus, any women strip searched after these dates would not have\na claim that is based on the common class issue in this case.\n7.  Plaintiffs have identified 109 women who received notice of the class action\nbut who are not class members because they were at the facility after Plymouth County\nchanged its policy or custom.\n8.  The 109 women will be notified of the amendment of the class definitions\nin order to preserve their opportunity to pursue a claim separately. See, Eisen v. Carlisle\nand Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156 (1974). Plaintiffโs counsel will pay the cost of printing and\nmailing the notices.\n9.  The proposed notice of amended class definitions informs the women why\nthe definitions were amended and explains that they may file an individual action. It\nalso explains that tolling of the statute of limitations.\n10.  The statute of limitations for claims that these women may bring separately\nwas tolled from the date the complaint in this case was filed on May 1, 2000. See, Crown\nCork & Seal, Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345 (1983). Plaintiffs request that the court order\nthat the tolling period end thirty (30) days from the date of the Courtโs Order amending\nthe class definitions. This will give adequate protection to the these women.\n11.  Plaintiffsโ counsel proposes that the notice be sent in an envelope bearing\nthe name of the Court with a return address to a post office box which is maintained by\nclass counsel. Those notices that are returned as undeliverable will go to class counsel.\nClass counsel will make reasonable efforts to find newer addresses for any such returned\n\nnotices and resend them.\n12.  The Settlement Agreement and the Notice to the Class include the correct class\nperiods in the Sub-Class definitions that the plaintiffs now seek to have formally\namended by this motion. The Sub-Class definitions in plaintiffsโ motion for preliminary\napproval of the settlement included class periods but the dates were reversed.
