Plaintiffs alleged that were arrested for \"minor\" civil offenses involving nonpayment of child support. One plaintiff was strip searched pursuant to a blanket written policy of the NHCCC requiring that all arrestees undergo strip searches.  The other  two plaintiffs were strip searched before the written policy was enacted.  Plaintiffs alleged that the strip searches violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.  They sought class certification, actual and punitive damages, and permanent injunctive relief.  The initial complaint was subsequently amended three times.  Defendants generally denied the allegations.</p><p>After the parties conducted initial discovery, plaintiffs moved for class certification for the limited purpose of seeking injunctive relief as to the challenged the \"blanket strip search policy.\"  Plaintiff also filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  </p><p>In January 2003, the District Court (District Judge Christopher F. Droney) referred the case to Magistrate Judge William I. Garfinkel for settlement purposes.  Judge Garfinkel conducted several settlement conferences. While negotiations were ongoing, Judge Droney denied the motion for class certification on March 6, 2003.  Foreman v. State of Connecticut, 2003 WL 1056750 (D. Conn. Mar 05, 2003).  The District Court the granted plaintiffs' cross-motion for partial summary judgment, but then vacated its order after defendants requested reconsideration.  The motion was then denied without prejudice in light of settlement negotiations.</p><p>The case was eventually settled and settlement authorized by the Connecticut State Legislature.  Magistrate Judge Garfinkel preliminarily approved the Class Action Settlement Agreement on March 16, 2006 and set the matter for a fairness hearing on July 20, 2006.  After the hearing, Judge Garfinkel issued an order finally approving the Settlement Agreement, in which the State agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle all class claims.  The Court approved attorneys' fees to class counsel in the amount of 1/3 of the settlement proceeds ($833,333.33).  No class member would receive in excess of $10,000 under the settlement's terms, except for the three named plaintiffs, who receive $20,000 apiece, in part for surrendering their anonymity to serve as named plaintiffs. </p><p>On November 2, 2007, the court entered an order dismissing the case. </p><p></p>",

Plaintiffs and Defendants continue to negotiate the terms of a potential \nsettlement of this case.  The parties’ negotiations continue to be monitored, facilitated and \nencouraged by Magistrate Judge William Garfinkel.  In fact, only last Thursday, December \n1, 2005, the parties met with Judge Garfinkel in an attempt to make further progress in \nsettlement negotiations.  The parties believe this meeting was successful in advancing this \ncase toward a final, global settlement. \n2.  Any proposed settlement of this case must be reviewed and approved by both \nhouses of the Connecticut State Legislature, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. §3-125a.  The \nGeneral Assembly reconvenes on February 8, 2006.  Prior to that time, the parties will \neither have reached a settlement agreement or will tender to the Court a proposed \nscheduling order for litigation.  If the parties reach agreement on settlement, they will \nsubmit such agreement to the General Assembly on February 8, 2006, OR WITHIN A \nREASONABLY PROMPT TIME FRAME THEREAFTER,  and if it is approved, will then \n\nsubmit such agreement to the Court for a preliminary fairness finding and for scheduling of \na  subsequent  fairness  hearing.    The  Court  may  wish  to  consider  setting  a  status \nconference just prior to the reconvening of the Legislature for the purpose of receiving and \ndiscussing the parties' proposed settlement plan or their proposed scheduling order. \nWHEREFORE, the parties request that the Court accept this Joint Report of the \npresent status of these proceedings. \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n  _______________________________ \n  Gregory A.

INTRODUCTION \nThe parties, by counsel, enter into this Settlement Aweement (\"the Agreement\"), \nwhich they will submit to the Court for its approval.  The Agreement: (a) contemplates \ncertification of a class consisting of all males who, after their arrest for any qualifying non-\nviolent, non-drug related misdemeanor offense, or amy civil contempt, were required by the \nNew Haven Community Correctional Center (\"NHCCC\") between January 12, 1998 and \nJanuary 12, 2001 to remove their clothing for visual inspection of their buttocks or genitalia, \nwhen there existed no basis for a reasonable,  individualized suspicion that they were \ncarrying or concealing weapons or contraband; and  (b) settles all claims of the class, \nincluding,  without  limitation  on  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  claims  of  class \nrepresentatives  and  absent  class  members  who  have  not opted  out,  for  all  money \ndamages, attorneys' fees,  costs, and interest, by establishing a common fund of $2.5 \nmillion, to be shared among participating class members after payment of attorneys' fees, \ncosts, claims ad ministration expenses, and payment to class representatives as provided \nI This Settlement Agreement supercedes the  terms set forth in the parties' Joint Stipulation of Settlement \npreviously tendered to the Court. \n\nCase 3:01-cv-00061-WIG     Document 104     Filed 07/20/2006     Page 2 of 21(cid:10)\nin ~ 36 below.  Under this Agreement class members will receive one payment no matter \nhow many times they were admitted into and/or searched while incarcerated at the NHCCC \nduring the class period. \nII.  TERMS \nA.  Procedural History \n1.  Plaintiffs filed this action on January 12, 2001. \n2.  Plaintiff Charles Campbell alleged that he was subjected to a strip and visual \nbody cavity search pursuant to policy at the NHCCC on December 13, 2000, after he was \nremanded by a judge at Superior Court pursuant to a family support mittimus.  He claimed \nthat he was not charged with the commission of any criminal offense and had no history of \ncriminal behavior that would justify the strip and visual body cavity search to which he was \nsubjected. \n3.  Plaintiffs Horace Dodd, Sr. and  Lorenzo Foreman allege they were both \nsubjected to strip and visual body cavity searches pursuant to a custom and practice at the \nNHCCC in  1998 and  1999 after they were ordered  detained  at the  NHCCC for civil \ncontempt for failure to pay child support obligations.  Both claimed that they were not \ncharged  with  the commission  of any criminal  offense and  had  no  history of criminal \nbehavior that would justify the strip and visual  body cavity search to which they were \nsubjected. \n4.  Defendants answered, denying all of Plaintiffs' material allegations.  After \ndiscovery, the parties entered into settlement negotiations, supervised by Magistrate Judge \nWilliam I.  Garfinkel, which have produced this Agreement. \n2 \n\nCase 3:01-cv-00061-WIG     Document 104     Filed 07/20/2006     Page 3 of 21(cid:10)\nB.  Class Definition and Certification \nI \n5.

Notice of the certification of the class and settlement shall issue within 30 \ndays following Legislative approval pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. §3-125a, as setforth in ~ \n48 below, both directly to the last known addresses of all potential class members and by \npublication, and in a form to be agreed upon by the parties, approved by the Court, and \nintended  to  maximize  notice to  the  class  and  ease the filing of proofs of claim  and \nadministration of the settlement. \nC.

J  Wa- \nOn Thursday, July 20, 2006, the parties appeared before the Court for a hearing concerning the \nfairness and reasonableness of the settlement reached in this class action proceeding.  Counsel for the \nplaintiffs and the defendants made presentations in favor of approval of the settlement, and the named \nclass representatives were afforded an opportunity to speak on the record.  Despite direct and published \nnotice of the fairness hearing, no one appeared at the hearing to object to, or opt out of, the class action, \nor to ask questions about the status of the case or the procedures for implementation of the settlement \nNo written objections to the settlement or opt-outs were received by the Claims Administrator prior to the \nhearing. \nPrior to the fairness hearing, the Court had worked extensively with the parties and their counsel \nin the negotiations that produced this settlement  The Court thus had many opportunities prior to the \nfairness hearing to test the positions of the parties and to observe first-hand the vigorousness with which \nthey were represented by counsel. \nNow, having heard the presentations of counsel and considered the comments of the named class \nrepresentatives, the Court finds as follows: \n1.  The  Court's  consideration  of the  fairness  and  reasonableness  of  this  class  action \nsettlement is governed by the factors delineated in the seminal case of City of Detroit v.  Grinnell Corp., \n495 F.2d 448 (20d Cir. 1974), abrogated on other grounds by Goldberger v.  Integrated Resources, Inc., \n209 F.3d 43 (20d  Cir. 2000).  Those factors are: (1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the \n\n,  , \n\"  '\" \nCase 3:01-cv-00061-WIG     Document 106     Filed 08/03/2006     Page 2 of 4(cid:10)\nlitigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of \ndiscovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the \nrisks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the ability of defendants to withstand a greater \njudgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; \nand (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund  to a possible recovery in  light of all  the \nattendant risks of litigation.  Id.,  at 463.  Having considered all  of these factors,  the Court finds  the \nsettlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. \n2.  Class action litigation under 42 U.S.C. §1983 is highly complex.  Litigating and resolving \nthe claims of hundreds of class members can be a very expensive and lengthy process.  This litigation has \nalready been pending over five years, and would likely take many more years to resolve given the legal \nand factual issues relating to class certification, liability and damages, and the likely discovery that would \nbe necessary before the parties could be expected to go to trial.  The settlement proposed by the parties \nwill save the parties and the Court considerable time and expense.  Instead of facing years of uncertainty, \nthe parties can resolve the case now under terms that are acceptable to them. \n3.  Given that there have been no objections to the settlement by class members, and that \nnone have opted out, it appears that the reaction of the class to the settlement weighs heavily in favor of \napproval. \n4.  All parties faced substantial risks in the absence of a settlement.  The Court had yet to \nresolve the issue of class certification, and liability and damages would no doubt be vigorously litigated. \nAny decision  by the Court on anyone or more of the critical issues that remained to be resolved, or any \ndevelopments in the facts of the case having a material effect on those issues, could have substantially \nimpacted the settlement positions of the parties or made settlement impossible. \n5.  While the Defendants may have been able to withstand a greater judgment, it is not at all \nclear whether they would have been exposed to a judgment at all, given the discussion above.  On the \nother hand, had  this case gone to trial, the Defendants could have been exposed to a judgment that \nexceeded the amount of the settlement fund agreed to by the parties.  However, it is unclear how many \nclass  members  would  have  been  willing  to  press  their  claims  individually  in  the  absence  of class \ncertification, and what a jury would have awarded had liability been proven, given the circumstances of the \n2 \n\nI  I  III \nCase 3:01-cv-00061-WIG     Document 106     Filed 08/03/2006     Page 3 of 4(cid:10)\ncase and the injuries alleged by the Plaintiffs. \n6.  To date, approximately 150 claims have been filed.  More will likely be filed prior to the \nclose of the claims period.  Lead counsel for the class estimated, based on his prior experience, that \nbetween one-quarter and one-third of all claims would be disallowed.  Whatever the number of remaining \nclaims,  it  is  clear that approved  claimants  will  receive  a fair,  reasonable  and  adequate  payout that \ncompares favorably with recoveries in comparable class actions.  The fact that outstanding liens will be \nwithheld from the payouts to approved claimants in no way diminishes the fairness or reasonableness of \nthe settlement, or its value to approved claimants. \n7.  The additional amounts awarded to the named class representatives are also fair and \nreasonable.  The amounts the named class representatives are entitled to recover under the terms of the \nsettlement -- $20,000 each - bear a reasonable relation to the amounts likely to be paid to approved \nclaimants.  In addition, it was the named class representatives who surrendered their anonymity, brought \nthis suit, participated in discovery and in settlement negotiations, and were the catalyst for this result.  The \nCourt finds that their participation in this case as named class representatives makes their award under \nthe terms of the settlement agreement fair, reasonable, and adequate. \n8.  The Court likewise finds the attorney's fee to be awarded to plaintiffs' counsel -- one-third \nof the settlement fund of $2.5 million -- to be fair and reasonable.  As noted above, on account of the \nCourt's involvement in the negotiations leading to the settlement of this case, the Court has been able to \nobserve first-hand the efforts and arguments of counsel on behalf of the parties.  The Court finds that all \nparties were zealously and competently represented by experienced counsel.  The Court finds the award \nfair and reasonable in consideration of all the factors set forth above, in addition to those articulated in \nGoldberger v. Integrated Resources, Inc., 209 F.3d 43, 50 (20 Cir. 2000), including the trend toward the \n' \naward of percentage fees noted therein. \n9.  At the fairness hearing, both parties provided the Court with affidavits attesting to the \nparties' satisfaction to date with  their respective obligations,  particularly as concerns the providing of \nnotice, under the settlement agreement.  The Court specifically finds that the parties have fully satisfied \ntheir notice obligations under the settlement agreement, and that the class has been provided with the \nbest notice practicable under the circumstances.  The class has been provided fair notice that is detailed \n3 \n\nCase 3:01-cv-00061-WIG     Document 106     Filed 08/03/2006     Page 4 of 4(cid:10)\nyet understandable via direct mailing,  publication in appropriate newspapers,  posting in the  institution \nmade the subject of these proceedings, and the establishment of a settlement website on-line that can be \naccessed by class members. \nFOR ALL THE REASONS SET FORTH ABOVE, the Court finds that the settlement of this \naction proposed by the parties is fair, reasonable and adequate, and it is hereby APPROVED. \nSO ORDERED, this  31 st  day of July, 2006, at Bridgeport, Connecticut. \n(V>u \n\"\"t  I \nWilliam I.
