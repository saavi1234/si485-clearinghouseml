    "summary": "<p>On February 3, 2004, private attorneys Andrew C. Schwartz and Mark E. Merin filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the  U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenging the San Mateo County Sheriff's policies, practices, and customs concerning the use of strip searches and visual body cavity searches on female detainees in the San Mateo County Jail.  Plaintiffs alleged that the Sheriff had a blanket policy of subjecting all female detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned, regardless of whether any reasonable suspicion existed that the detainees possessed contraband or weapons.  This policy, plaintiffs alleged, violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and California state law.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages and class certification.  Defendants generally denied the allegations.</p><p>On October 31, 2005, the District Court (Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong) granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification.  October 28, 2005, the Honorable Saundra Brown Armstrong issued her Order certifying the action to proceed as a class action, with the classes defined as follows: </p><p>a. Federal claim (\"Class One\"): All women who, from February 3, 2002 to December 2, 2003, were arrested on any charge (including felonies) not involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, and not involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where consent to search is a condition of such probation), and who were subjected to a uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity search by defendants before arraignment at the San Mateo County Jail without any individualized reasonable suspicions that they were concealing contraband. This class also includes all female arrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket strip search before arraignment after the initial strip/visual body cavity search without any reasonable individualized suspicion that they had subsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons.</p><p>b. State law claim (\"Class Two\"): All female arrestees who, from June 12, 2003 to December 2, 2003, were arrested on an infraction or misdemeanor charge and brought to the San Mateo County Jail and who were subjected to a uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity search before arraignment without written supervisorial authorization, as required under California Penal Code § 4030(f).</p><p>Protracted negotiations followed, including a series of settlement conferences with Chief Magistrate Judge James Larson and the Honorable Raul A. Ramirez (retired).  Eventually, the parties reached a tentative resolution and filed a joint motion for preliminary settlement approval on February 5, 2007.  </p><p>Following a fairness hearing on November 6, 2007, Judge Armstrong approved the class settlement.  A final order of dismissal was entered on November 29, 2007.  Under the settlement, defendants agreed to pay 1.9 million to settle all class claims.  Of that sum, $600,000 went to class counsel Andrew C. Schwartz and Mark E. Merin for attorneys' fees and up to $150,000 was allocated for the costs of claims administration.  The named representative plaintiffs collectively shared $120,000.  Up to $1.15 million was allocated to pay valid individual claims, based on an agreed distribution formula.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiffs  seek  an  order  declaring  illegal  defendants’  policy  of  subjecting \n6  detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they are \n7  arraigned  and  without  having  any  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  searches  will  be \n8  productive of contraband.  \n9  Defendants’ strip search and visual body cavity search policies, practices, and \n10  customs  violate  plaintiffs’  rights  secured  to  them  by  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \n11  Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and entitle plaintiffs to recover damages under \n12  the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. sec 1983).   \n13     Additionally, plaintiffs include supplemental claims under California state law \n14  against defendants: 1) for violation of California Penal Code sec 4030 which prohibits \n15  pre-arraignment strip searches of most misdemeanents and provides for minimum \n16  damages of $1,000 for each illegal search; and 2) for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights \n17  Act (California Civil Code sec 52 and 52.1(b)) pursuant to which each plaintiff denied a \n18  statutory or state or federal Constitutional right is entitled to recover a minimum of \n19  $4,000 for each violation.   \n20  JURISDICTION \n21  1.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 USC sec 1983 and 1988, and the \n22  Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is \n23  founded upon 28 USC sec 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory \n24  and constitutional provisions.   \n25  2.  The court has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims under \n26  28 USC sec 1367(a). \n27  3.  The  amount  in  controversy  exceeds  $10,000,  excluding  interest  and \n28  costs. \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

Plaintiffs  SHANNON  GALLAGHER,  ROBERTA  BAUCCIO,  GRACE \n3  CARLAND, and all those similarly situated, are, and at all material times herein, were \n4  citizens of the United States and residents of the state of California who were arrested \n5  within the period beginning three (3) years before July 10, 2003, and continuing to this \n6  date, and who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at any and all \n7  San Mateo County Jails (hereinafter referred to as the “San Mateo Jail”), prior to being \n8  arraigned  and/or  without  the  defendants  first  having,  and  recording  in  writing,  a \n9  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  searches  would  be  productive  of  contraband  or \n10  weapons. \n11  5.  Defendant COUNTY OF SAN MATEO SHERIFF DON HORSLEY is, and \n12  at all material times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of the county of \n13  San Mateo, responsible for administering the Jail facilities and for making, overseeing, \n14  and implementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to \n15  the operation of the San Mateo Jail.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities. \n16  6.  Defendants SAN MATEO COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein \n17  by their fictitious names (Does 1 through 150) are all deputies who, as part of their \n18  duties at the San Mateo Jails, subjected plaintiff to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual \n19  body  cavity  searches  without  first  having,  and  recording  in  writing,  a  reasonable \n20  suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.    \n21  7.  At  all  material  times  mentioned  herein,  each  of  the  defendants  was \n22  acting under the color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, \n23  policies, customs and usages of the State of California, the COUNTY OF SAN MATEO \n24  and/or the SAN MATEO COUNTY SHERIFF.  \n25  8.  Defendant  COUNTY  OF  SAN  MATEO  is,  and  at  all  material  times \n26  referred  to  herein,  was,  a  division  of  the  state  of  California,  that  maintained  or \n27  permitted an official policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence \n28  of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

Plaintiffs’ allegations against the COUNTY are based on acts and \n2  omissions of the SHERIFF and his deputies and on acts and omissions of persons \n3  who are COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’s breach of its duty to protect \n4  plaintiffs from the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees. \n5  9.  Defendants  SAN  MATEO  COUNTY  SHERIFF’S  DEPARTMENT  and \n6  SAN  MATEO  COUNTY  SHERIFF  DON  HORSLEY,  in  his  individual  and  official \n7  capacity, also maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or practice causing \n8  or  permitting  the  occurrence  of  the  types  of  wrongs  complained  of  herein,  which \n9  wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein alleged. \n10  10.  Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period \n11  beginning three (3) years before July 10, 2003, and continuing to this date, were \n12  subjected by defendants to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches \n13  without defendants having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the \n14  searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.  \n15  FACTS \n16  11.  On July 10, 2003 at approximately 1:00 p.m., in the City of Pacifica, \n17  plaintiff, SHANNON GALLAGHER was arrested by a member of the Pacifica Police \n18  Department on a three year old San Francisco County traffic warrant for driving on a \n19  suspended license. \n20  12.  Despite the fact that Shannon Gallagher had a valid driver’s license in \n21  her possession that had been issued nine months earlier, she was arrested and taken \n22  to Pacifica Police Department and placed in a holding cell.   \n23  13.  Shannon Gallagher remained at Pacifica Police Department for a short \n24  period of time, and was then taken to the San Mateo County Jail at Redwood City \n25  where she remained for three hours and was subjected to a strip search and a visual \n26  body cavity search.   \n27  14.  Shannon Gallagher remained at the San Mateo County Jail in Redwood \n28  City for approximately three hours when she was then handcuffed and placed in a van \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

Upon  entry  to  the  correctional  facility,  Shannon  Gallagher  was  strip \n3  searched for a second time and once again subjected to a visual body cavity search.   \n4  16.  During both of these visual body cavity searches, Shannon Gallagher \n5  was compelled to expose her genitalia and other private parts and was left standing \n6  naked for a significant period of time.  She remained in San Mateo County Women’s \n7  Correctional Center for several more hours prior to bailing out.   \n8  17.  Plaintiff was given a court date of August 18, 2003 in San Francisco \n9  County when the charges against her were dropped. \n10  18.  Within six months of her arrest, plaintiff SHANNON GALLAGHER filed a \n11  group government tort claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of \n12  said  claim  is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A,  and  incorporated  herein  to  the  extent \n13  relevant by this reference).    Plaintiff GALLAGHER’s group claim was denied on or \n14  about January 15, 2004 allowing the filing of this Complaint. \n15  19.  ROBERTA BAUCCIO is a 74 year old retired secretary, who, on August \n16  13, 2002, was arrested for driving while under the influence and taken to the San \n17  Mateo County Jail where, prior to her arraignment, she was subjected to a visual body \n18  cavity search where she was compelled to expose her genitalia and other private \n19  parts.   \n20  20.  On  September  3,  2002,  she  was  arrested  again  for  driving  on  a \n21  suspended license in violation of California Vehicle Code Section 14601, and was \n22  once again subjected to an identical visual body cavity search.   \n23  21.  Grace Carland is 64 years old and was arrested in San Mateo County on \n24  April 16, 2002 for violations of California Penal Code Sections 487 and 459.  She was \n25  taken to the Maguire detention facility at 7:30 in the morning and was subjected to a \n26  visual body cavity search where she was compelled to expose her genitalia and other \n27  private parts prior to her arraignment later that day. She was never taken to the San \n28  Mateo County Women’s Correctional Center and bailed out later that afternoon. \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants \n2  routinely  follow  their  policy,  practice,  and  custom  of  subjection  pre-arraignment \n3  detainees, including, plaintiffs, to strip and visual body cavity searches without having, \n4  and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search will be productive of \n5  contraband or weapons. \n6  23.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants \n7  have the ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, \n8  while  in  defendants’  custody,  at  the  San  Mateo  Jail  since  July  10,  2000,  were \n9  subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment \n10  without  defendants  first  having,  and  recording,  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the \n11  searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n12  24.  Defendant SHERIFF DON HORSLEY is personally responsible for the \n13  promulgation  and  continuation  of  the  strip  search  policy,  practice,  and  custom \n14  pursuant to which some of the plaintiffs herein were subjected to searches complained \n15  of herein. \n16  25.  As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, \n17  each of the plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of \n18  privacy,  and  violation  of  due  process  of  law  and  state  and  federal  statutory  and \n19  constitutional rights, and are entitled to recover damages according to proof, but, at a \n20  minimum, $1,000 as specified in California Penal Code § 4030 (p) and $4,000 as \n21  specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b). \n22  CLASS CLAIMS \n23  26.  The  strip  and  visual  body  cavity  searches  to  which  plaintiffs  were \n24  subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants \n25  SHERIFF  HORSLEY,  COUNTY  OF  SAN  MATEO  SHERIFF’S  DEPARTMENT, \n26  COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, and the individual deputies sued herein by the fictitious \n27  names 1 through 150.  The searches complained of herein were performed without \n28  regard to the nature of the alleged offenses for which plaintiffs had been arrested, \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

Furthermore, the searches complained of \n4  herein were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintiffs \n5  so searched possessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting \n6  a reasonable belief that the searches would produce contraband, and those facts \n7  being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.  \n8  27.  Plaintiffs bring this action on her own behalf and on behalf of all persons \n9  similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California \n10  Code of Civil Procedure sec 382.   \n11  28.  The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and \n12  including July 10, 2003, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated \n13  and the practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-\n14  arraignment  strip  and/or  visual  body  cavity  search  at  the  San  Mateo  Jail  without \n15  defendants having, and recording, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be \n16  productive of contraband or weapons. \n17  29.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n18  members of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  \n19  Plaintiffs do not know the exact number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n20  believe, and thereupon allege, that there are more than 100 persons per day who are \n21  arrested  by  defendants  and/or  in  the  custody of defendants and subjected to the \n22  searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom \n23  relating to said searches.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, \n24  that there are tens of thousands of persons in the proposed class. \n25  30.

In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(a), \n14  plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  there  are  many \n15  questions of law common to the class including, but are not limited to: (1) whether \n16  defendants  may  perform  visual  body  cavity  searches  on  persons  prior  to  their \n17  arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to \n18  believe any particular inmate has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which \n19  would likely be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants may \n20  perform visual body cavity searches on persons without first reasonably relating the \n21  use of the visual body cavity search to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the \n22  security of the jail and determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that \n23  interest; (3) whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the \n24  search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating \n25  plaintiffs’  State  and  Federal  constitutional  rights  and  the  protections  afforded  to \n26  plaintiffs  under  California  Penal  Code  section  4030;  and,  (4)  whether  or  not \n27  defendants’ strip search policy and procedure is in accordance with the State and/or \n28  Federal Constitution. \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N. California Blvd., \nSuite 1020 \nWalnut Creek, CA  94596  Amended Class Action Complaint  Page 8 \nTEL: (925) 947-1147  Gallagher, et al. v. County of San Mateo, et al.    USCD Northern District Case No. C04-0448 SBA \nFAX (925) 947-1131 \n\n \nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 48-1     Filed 07/18/2006     Page 9 of 13(cid:10)\n1  32.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n2  claims of the representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, \n3  prior to arraignment, without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity \n4  search would produce drugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting \n5  any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-approved writing).  Representative \n6  plaintiffs have the same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the \n7  class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice, and \n8  custom  of  subjecting  arrestees  to  strip  and/or  visual  body  cavity  searches  before \n9  arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the \n10  search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Plaintiffs’ claims are based \n11  upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each class member \n12  suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity search. \n13  The actual damages suffered by the representative plaintiffs are similar in type and \n14  amount to the actual damages suffered by each class member.   \n15  33.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n16  representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ \n17  interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   \n18  34.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \n19  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n20  risk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \n21  class would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the \n22  class.   \n23  35.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \n24  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n25  risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which \n26  would, as a practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other \n27  members of the class to protect their interests. \n28  36.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this \n5  class  action  is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  equitable \n6  adjudication  of  the  controversy  between  the  parties.    Plaintiffs  are  informed  and \n7  believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of the class in individually \n8  controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class members \n9  would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n10  believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small \n11  that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \n12  thereupon allege, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \n13  represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is \n14  desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the \n15  same location; i.e., the COUNTY OF SAN MATEO.  It will promote judicial efficiency to \n16  resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple \n17  courts.   \n18  38.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs \n19  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  the  identities  of  the  class \n20  members may be ascertained from records maintained by the COUNTY OF SAN \n21  MATEO and defendant SHERIFF DON HORSLEY and defendant COUNTY OF SAN \n22  MATEO  SHERIFF’S  DEPARTMENT.    Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe,  and \n23  thereupon allege, that defendants’ records reflect the identities, including addresses \n24  and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in the San \n25  Mateo Jails.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that records of, \n26  and maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body \n27  cavity search, when the search occurred, where the search occurred, whether any \n28  reasonable  suspicion  for  the  search  existed  and  was  recorded  in  a  supervisor-\nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class \n9  members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, \n10  including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable \n11  effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ \n12  computer  records  contain  a  last  known  address  for  class  members.    Plaintiffs \n13  contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such last known \n14  address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class \n15  members of the following: \n16  1.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the \n17      class; \n18  2.  The nature of the action; \n19  3.  Their right to “opt out” of the action within a given time, in which \n20  event they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class \n21  action; \n22  4.  Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to be represented by their own \n23  counsel and to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they \n24  will be represented by the named class plaintiff and their counsel; \n25  and  \n26  5.

STATEMENT OF FACTS/HISTORY OF LITIGATION\n14 On or about February 3, 2004, plaintiff, SHANNON GALLAGHER, filed a class action\n15 complaint against defendants, amended on July 18, 2006, to add plaintiffs ROBERTA BAUCCIO\n16 and GRACE CARLAND as additional representative plaintiffs, challenging the defendants’ policy\n17 of strip searching persons, prior to arraignment, who were arrested on charges not involving\n18 violence, drugs, or weapons.  \n19 The parties engaged in extensive discovery which included exchange of documents,\n20 preparation of and responses to request for production of documents, interrogatories and depositions\n21 of policy makers and line officers, as well as depositions of the parties.  \n22 Effective December 2, 2003, defendants revised their strip search policies to eliminate\n23 automatic, blanket strip searches of women housed in the Women’s Correctional Center prior to\n24 arraignment.  They also revised their practice to ensure that women arrested on felony charges were\n25 not subject to blanket strip searches at the Maguire Correctional Facility unless there was individual,\n26 reasonable suspicion for such strip searches based upon the arrest charges or other factors.  A copy\n27 of defendants’ revised policies is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n28 \\\\\\\nPAGE 2 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al.

For the federal claim (“Class One”):\n5 All women who, from February 3, 2002 to December 2, 2003, were arrested on any\n6 charge  (including  felonies)  not  involving  weapons,  controlled  substances,  or\n7 violence, and not involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where\n8 consent to search is a condition of such probation), and who were subjected to a\n9 uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity search by defendants\n10 before  arraignment  at  the  San  Mateo  County  Jail  without  any  individualized\n11 reasonable suspicions that they were concealing contraband. This class also includes\n12 all female arrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket strip search before\n13 arraignment after the initial strip/visual body cavity search without any reasonable\n14 individualized suspicion that they had subsequently acquired and hidden contraband\n15 on their persons.\n16 b.  For the state law claim (\"Class Two\"):\n17 All female arrestees who, from June 12, 2003 to December 2, 2003, were arrested on\n18 an infraction or misdemeanor charge and brought to the San Mateo County Jail and\n19 who were subjected to a uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity\n20 search before arraignment without written supervisorial authorization, as required\n21 under California Penal Code § 4030(f).\n22 On December 16, 2005, and again on April 5, 2006, the parties met with Chief Magistrate\n23 Judge James Larson in an attempt to mediate resolution of their dispute.  That attempt was\n24 unsuccessful and the parties continued to litigate the matter until August 15 and 16, 2006, when they\n25 participated in further mediation sessions presided over by the Honorable Raul A. Ramirez (Ret.).\n26 Thereafter, the parties continued their negotiations and, finally, agreed to a Stipulation of Settlement,\n27 a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B, which, subject to the approval of the Court, settles\n28 this action in the manner and upon the terms set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement.

SUMMARY OF APPLICABLE LAW\n5 A. Federal Law\n6 In 1979 the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 449\n7 (1979), held that custodial strip searches are subject to a balancing test which weighs the privacy\n8 interest of the person to be searched against the legitimate security interests of the institution.\n9 Following Bell v. Wolfish, courts considering the issue have applied objective standards to determine\n10 the reasonableness of strip searches of pre-trial detainees.  \n11 In 1984, In Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 619 (9th Cir. 1984), the Ninth Circuit applied\n12 the test of reasonableness to a strip search of a pre-arraignment detainee at a county jail and held that\n13 a pre-arraignment strip search of a person arrested for a minor offense is unconstitutional absent an\n14 individualized suspicion that such arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or suffering from\n15 a communicable disease.  The fact that an arrestee might ultimately be intermingled with the general\n16 population did not, by itself, justify a strip search as such intermingling at the pre-arraignment stage\n17 was found to be “both limited and avoidable.”  (Id., 745 F.2d at 618.)  \n18 In 1988, the Ninth Circuit decided Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Department, 901 F.2d 702\n19 (9th Cir. 1990).  There, plaintiff was arrested and charged with grand theft, a felony, after a dispute\n20 with a roommate concerning ownership of a T.V.  She was stripped and subjected to a visual body\n21 cavity search after she was booked and before she was placed in the general population.  In that case\n22 the court found that a blanket policy that subjected all felony arrestees to a visual body cavity search\n23 upon  booking  in  the  county  jail  was  a  violation  of  the  Fourth  Amendment,  in  that  the\n24 felony/misdemeanor classification was not “reasonably related to the institution’s objective of\n25 maintaining security.”  (901 F.2d at 714.)  \n26 In 1992, the Ninth Circuit decided ActUp!/Portland v. Bagley, 971 F2d. 298 (9th Cir. 1992).\n27 There, the court summarized the rule regarding strip searches as follows:\n28 At the time appellees were searched, it was clearly established in this\ncircuit that it is unlawful to strip search an arrestee brought to a jail\nPAGE 4 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT CLASS AND SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-1     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 5 of 14(cid:10)\n1 facility on charges of committing a minor offense, unless the officer\ndirecting  the  search  possesses  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the\n2 individual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband.  Giles v.\nAckerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S.\n3 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114.  Reasonable suspicion may be based on “such\nfactors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and\n4 conduct, and the prior arrest record.”  Id.  Adhering to the Supreme\nCourt’s direction in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 529, 99 S.Ct. 1861,\n5 1884 (1979), the Giles test accounts for the fact that local jail\nfacilities frequently confront difficult security problems, and balances\n6 those facility’s interests in controlling such problems against the\nprivacy interests of arrestees.  See, 746 F.2d at 617.\n7\n8 (917 F.2d at 301.)\n9 B. State Law\n10 1. Penal Code § 4030:\n11 Penal Code § 4030 was enacted with the express intent to protect the state and federal\n12 constitutional rights of pre-arraignment adult arrestees and pre-detention hearing juvenile arrestees\n13 detained for minor offenses.  (Penal Code § 4030(a).)  Penal Code § 4030(f) prohibits visual body\n14 cavity searches and strip searches of prearraignment detainees “held in custody on a misdemeanor\n15 or infraction offense, except those involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence,” unless\n16 “a peace officer has determined there is reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts\n17 to believe that such person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and the strip search will result in\n18 the discovery of the weapon or contraband.”  The subsection further provides that no strip search\n19 may be conducted without the prior written authorization of a supervising officer on duty and that\n20 the authorization “shall include the specific and articulable facts and circumstances upon which the\n21 reasonable suspicion determination was made by the supervisor.”  \n22 Penal Code § 4030(m) provides that all strip searches “shall be conducted in an area of\n23 privacy so that the search cannot be observed by persons not participating in the search.”  \n24 Penal Code § 4030(p) provides that any person who suffers damages as a result of a violation\n25 of 4030 may recover actual damages or $1,000, which ever is greater, in addition to other relief the\n26 court may award, including reasonable attorney’s fees.  \n27 \\\\\\\n28 \\\\\\\nPAGE 5 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v.

California Constitution:\n2 Article I, § 1 of the California Constitution states that privacy is an inalienable right.  In Hill\n3 v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, 7 Cal.4th 1, 26 Cal.Rptr. 834 (1994), the California\n4 Supreme Court set out clear and detailed guidelines for courts to follow in addressing alleged\n5 violations of California States Right to Privacy.  \n6 Persons who are strip searched in violation of Penal Code § 4030 are, ipso facto, deprived\n7 of a specific statutory protection in violation of privacy protected, as well, by the California State\n8 Constitution. \n9 3. Federal Class Action Law:\n10 Class action certification under Federal Rule 23 has been the preferred method for dealing\n11 with cases challenging blanket jail pre-arraignment (pre-detention hearing) strip search policies.\n12 (See Smith v. Montgomery County, 573 F.Supp 604 (Dist. MD 1983); Mack v. Suffolk County, 191\n13 F.R.D. 16 (Dist. Mass 2000); Nielson v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19 (Dist. MA 2003); Tardiff v.\n14 Knox County, 218 F.R.D. 332 (Dist. MA 2003); Doe v. Calumet City, Illinois, 128 F.R.D. 93 (N.D.\n15 Ill. 1989); Marybeth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1267, fn.2 (7th Cir. 1983); Maneely v.\n16 City of Newburg, 208 F.R.D. 69 (S.D. NY 2002); and Bull, et al. v. San Francisco, et al., WL\n17 449148 (2006).)\n18 On April 9, 2004, the First Circuit Court of Appeal in Tardiff v. Knox County, et al.,\n19 consolidated with Nielson v. York County, et al., upheld the certification of two blanket strip search\n20 cases under Federal Rule 23(b)(3).  (365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004).)  \n21 The advantages of certification in blanket strip search cases is manifest where the common\n22 issues of law or fact predominate over individual issues.  In this class action case before this Court\n23 for preliminary approval of the proposed class settlement, the benefits to the parties include, for\n24 defendants, a complete settlement of all claims of persons in the class with claims for damages\n25 arising during the period from February 3, 2002, to December 2, 2003, and obtaining res judicata\n26 effect of the settlement.  For plaintiffs, the settlement of the class action provides a fund adequate\n27 to pay claims of all those persons submitting the requisite Claim Form who were strip searched in\n28 violation of federal law or state statute at or above the minimum payment to which they would be\nPAGE 6 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v.

OUTLINE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT\n4 A. Purpose\n5 The purpose of the proposed settlement is fully and finally to resolve all claims for damages\n6 which any female strip searched in violation of state or federal law at the San Mateo County Maguire\n7 Correctional Facility or the Women’s Correctional Center, prior to arraignment, during the period\n8 from February 3, 2002, to and including December 2, 2003, might have; to provide adequate\n9 compensation for each such person; to ensure that defendants, once the settlement funds have been\n10 distributed, shall be fully and finally relieved of all further liability to any persons in the class and\n11 bound by the Court’s final judgment; and to provide a mechanism by which persons challenging the\n12 fairness of the proposed settlement may do so.\n13 To accomplish the above-stated purposes, the parties entered into negotiations, facilitated by\n14 first Chief Magistrate Judge James Larson and thereafter by the Honorable Raul Ramirez (Ret.),\n15 acting as mediators, and negotiated the Stipulation of Settlement, a copy of which is attached hereto\n16 as Exhibit B. \n17 The principle provisions of the attached settlement are the following:  \n18 B. Description of Class Members\n19 The settlement class is, as the Honorable Saundra Brown Armstrong stated in her Order\n20 certifying the action to proceed as a class action:\n21 a. For the federal claim (\"Class One\"):\n22 All women who, from February 3, 2002 to December 2, 2003, were arrested on any\n23 charge  (including  felonies)  not  involving  weapons,  controlled  substances,  or\n24 violence, and not involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where\n25 consent to search is a condition of such probation), and who were subjected to a\n26 uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity search by defendants\n27 before  arraignment  at  the  San  Mateo  County  Jail  without  any  individualized\n28 reasonable suspicions that they were concealing contraband. This class also includes\nPAGE 7 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT CLASS AND SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-1     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 8 of 14(cid:10)\n1 all female arrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket strip search before\n2 arraignment after the initial strip/visual body cavity search without any reasonable\n3 individualized suspicion that they had subsequently acquired and hidden contraband\n4 on their persons.\n5 b. For the state law claim (\"Class Two\"):\n6 All female arrestees who, from June 12, 2003 to December 2, 2003, were arrested on\n7 an infraction or misdemeanor charge and brought to the San Mateo County Jail and\n8 who were subjected to a uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity\n9 search before arraignment without written supervisorial authorization, as required\n10 under California Penal Code § 4030(f).\n11 The Class Period extends from February 3, 2002, to December 2, 2003, the date on which\n12 new strip search policies, in compliance with state and federal law, were promulgated by defendants.\n13 C.  Compensation Provided By Settlement\n14 The Stipulation of Settlement provides for the payment of up to One Million, One Hundred\n15 Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,150,000) to satisfy all claims of the Settlement Class Members\n16 (“SCMs”).  All SCMs who submit qualifying verified Claim Forms will be compensated as follows:\n17 for each booking up to a maximum of three (3) bookings, SCMs will receive the following payments.\n18 The Administrator will determine the amount of each Tier 1 payment based on the SCM’s responses\n19 to the Claim Form and the database provided by the County. \n20 Tier 1 Payments\n21 (a) If they were booked and transferred to the Women’s Correctional Center, prior to\n22 arraignment, a base sum of $2,500;\n23 (b) If they  were booked and released, without being transferred to the Women’s\n24 Correctional Center, a base payment of $1,250.\n25 SCMs who seek more than the basic payments provided pursuant to Tier 1 shall have their\n26 claims determined in accordance with the criteria set forth below relating to Tiers 2 and 3.  \n27 \\\\\\\n28 \\\\\\\nPAGE 8 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT CLASS AND SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-1     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 9 of 14(cid:10)\n1 Requirements for Being Considered for Tier 2 Payments\n2 In order to be considered for a Tier 2 payment, the SCM must answer applicable questions\n3 1 through 5 in the Claim Form and provide substantiating detail in accordance with the instructions\n4 in the Claim Form.  Questions 1 through 5 are designed to determine if circumstances existed at the\n5 time of the strip search which merit, in all fairness, additional compensation for the SCM.  Those\n6 factors include the following: age (under 21 or over 60); the existence of a physical disability or\n7 disfigurement (such as an embarrassing scar condition in a private area); a mental disability; a\n8 condition of pregnancy (more than 3 months); piercings in a private area which had to be removed\n9 or hair extensions or religious garments which had to be removed; a female who was menstruating\n10 at the time of the strip search.  The SCMs must also provide substianting detail in accordance with\n11 the instructions when they submit their Claim Forms to qualify for Tier 2 payments.  The Claims\n12 Administrator will assign points to the SCMs based on responses to the questions and the\n13 substantiating detail provided which may permit SCMs to receive up to an additional $3,000 over\n14 the base payment.  \n15  Requirements for Obtaining Tier 3 Payments\n16 SCMs may also qualify for Tier 3 payments of up to $25,000 if they received counseling or\n17 therapy as a result of the strip search, were diagnosed with a psychological condition resulting from\n18 the strip search, or suffered other significant ill effects from the strip search and provided\n19 substantiating documentation in support of their request for Tier 3 payments.  \n20 The stipulated settlement provides a method by which the Claims Administrator makes a\n21 preliminary determination of the value of payments to be made to the SCMs and the parties may\n22 review the Administrator’s determination subject to appeal to the Special Master which shall be\n23 binding.  \n24 D. Reduction Categories\n25 Amounts payable to SCMs who qualify for payments under Tiers 2 and 3 shall be subject to\n26 reduction if the claimant falls into any of the following categories:\n27 1. If the SCM owes debt to the County which could be collected by the San Mateo\n28 County Tax Collector-Treasurer-Revenue Services for unpaid work furlough fees\nPAGE 9 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT CLASS AND SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-1     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 10 of 14(cid:10)\n1 and/or owed debts to the county of San Mateo or to the state of California for unpaid\n2 child support, Tier 2 and 3 payments will be reduced by up to 50% to recover the\n3 SCMs’ obligations;\n4 2. Awards otherwise payable to an SCM under Tiers 2 and 3 will be reduced by 75%\n5 if, within five (5) years preceding the strip search, the SCM was sentenced to and\n6 incarcerated in county jail or state prison.  \n7 E. Proportionate Reduction/Revision\n8 If the total value of all SCM claims which are submitted before the Bar Date to be established\n9 by the Court exceeds the total amount allocated for payment of class claims, payout for the claims\n10 will be reduced proportionately so that the entire amount available is disbursed.  If the total value\n11 of claims submitted is less than One Million, One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,150,000),\n12 the amount remaining in the Payment Fund will revert to defendants.  \n13 F. Payment to Representative Plaintiffs\n14 The named plaintiffs, SHANNON GALLAGHER, ROBERTA BAUCCIO and GRACE\n15 CARLAND shall be entitled to a distribution of One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000)\n16 from the Payment Fund of up to One Million, One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,150,000).\n17 The distribution to the named plaintiffs shall not be reduced proportionately if the total of all valid\n18 claims, including the distribution to the named plaintiffs, exceeds One Million, One Hundred Fifty\n19 Thousand Dollars ($1,150,000).  \n20 G. Process for Claims Submission\n21 Following preliminary approval of the proposed settlement by this Court, the parties, through\n22 a retained firm1 specializing in class action claim administration, will notify each of the class\n23 members of the terms of the proposed settlement and provide each claimant with a claim form to be\n24 completed and returned within the specified 90 day period.  The Notice and Claim Form, copies of\n25 which are attached hereto as Exhibits C and D, direct the SCMs to answer questions on the form\n26 which, together with information contained in defendants’ database and substantiating detail\n27\n28 1\n  The parties have agreed that Gilardi and Co., LLC will act as Claims Administrators and are requesting the\nCourt appoint them for that purpose.\nPAGE 10 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT CLASS AND SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-1     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 11 of 14(cid:10)\n1 provided by the SCMs,  will determine the level of payment the claimants will receive.  The SCMs’\n2 responses are supplemental to information contained in the database which will be used to determine\n3 eligibility for payment and entitlement to certain additional payments for reasons such as: multiple\n4 bookings, age of claimant at time of strip search,  and severity of charges.  \n5 The Claims Administrator will not only mail the Notice and Claim Form to the last known\n6 address of each claimant, but will publish a summary form of the Notice in mass media and will\n7 make specific attempts to locate persons whose Claim Forms are returned as undeliverable or who\n8 are incarcerated, as shown on the database of persons in institutions, jails or prisons within the state\n9 of California.  \n10 Claim Forms will also be available to be downloaded from a website established by the Class\n11 Claims Administrator and will be provided by the Claims Administrator or by Class Counsel in\n12 response to specific requests for such forms, and furnished to institutions to be distributed to\n13 prospective claimants.\n14 The Claim Form informs the claimants that Class Counsel will provide assistance to those\n15 class  claimants who require it if they contact the offices of Class Counsel.\n16 Claim Forms received by the Claims Administrator by the cut off date for submission of\n17 claims will be examined.  Based on the answers provided by the claimant and following comparison\n18 with database information, the Claims Administrator will determine the number of points to be\n19 assigned to the claim and the value of each claim.  \n20 Any award to SCMs shall be subject to reduction as stated above.  The defendants will\n21 provide to the Claims Administrator, with a copy to Class Counsel, a list of all qualified SCMs who\n22 have debts owed to the County or to the State in specific identified categories and who submit valid\n23 claims, with the amount of the debt owed to the County and/or State specified.  The Claims\n24 Administrator will then deduct from each SCM’s award the amount of the specified debt owed to\n25 the County or to the state, up to the maximums provided in the Stipulation of Settlement.  SCMs may\n26 submit written objections to reduction for the debts owed to the County or State within 30 days of\n27 the date that settlement checks are distributed.  Written objections shall specify the grounds for\n28 objection and copies shall be sent to Class Counsel and defendants’ counsel.  In the event that the\nPAGE 11 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT CLASS AND SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-1     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 12 of 14(cid:10)\n1 SCM, Class Counsel and defense counsel cannot informally resolve the objection, then the objection\n2 will be submitted to the Special Master for binding determination.\n3 H. Opt Outs\n4 In the Notice to the class of the Court’s ruling certifying the Class, SCMs were informed that\n5 they could exclude themselves (opt out) of the class by mailing a letter to Class Counsel, postmarked\n6 on or before March 31, 2006, requesting exclusion from the class.  A copy of the published Notice\n7 is attached hereto as Exhibit E.    As of March 31, 2006, no persons requested exclusion from the\n8 class.  \n9 I. Settlement Funds for Claimants\n10 The total settlement amount for distribution to claimants is One Million, One Hundred Fifty\n11 Thousand Dollars ($1,150,000) which shall be allocated to pay verified claims, including One\n12 Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000) for the representative plaintiffs who are named\n13 plaintiffs in this action who have participated actively in the litigation.  \n14 If less than the total amount of funds available for payout to SCMs exceeds the value of the\n15 verified claims submitted by the Bar Date, the balance of the funds shall revert to defendants.\n16 J. Claims Administration Fund\n17 Defendants will allocate up to One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) to cover the\n18 cost of processing and administering the settlement.  If the total cost of the claims administration is\n19 less than One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000), the balance of any funds allocated for\n20 this purpose will revert to defendants.  In addition to Claims Administration costs and expenses, the\n21 expenses of the Special Master will be charged to the Claims Administration Fund as expenses\n22 relating to Claims Administration.\n23 K. Attorneys’ Fees\n24 Defendants will allocate Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($600,000) to pay attorneys fees and\n25 costs incurred by Class Counsel for representation of representative plaintiffs and class members.\n26 This amount is 31.5% of the total settlement which is within the range of attorney’s fees awarded\n27 in similar cases and less than the 33 1/3% specified in Class Counsel’s contingency fee agreements\n28 with representative plaintiffs.  Payment will be made as follows: Three Hundred Thousand Dollars\nPAGE 12 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT CLASS AND SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-1     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 13 of 14(cid:10)\n1 ($300,000) within 20 days of the Effective Date, and Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000)\n2 upon distribution of settlement funds to claimants.  This award is subject to approval of the Court.\n3 L. The Settlement is Fair and an Appropriate Method to Resolve this Litigation\n4 As a result of the discovery in this action, the parties agree that there were approximately\n5 1,000 bookings of SCMs during the Class Period and that all females booked on charges not\n6 involving violence, drugs or weapons, or otherwise subject to strip search on reasonable suspicion,\n7 who were  strip searched prior to arraignment, are entitled to participate in this settlement.\n8 Experience from settlement of other class action strip search cases indicates that it is probable that\n9 25% of the class or fewer will submit completed Claim Forms.  Efforts will be made to locate SCMs\n10 whose Claim Forms are returned from the last known address to which they will be mailed.  \n11 The settlement is structured to compensate persons strip searched at San Mateo County jails\n12 at or above the minimum statutory compensation specified in Penal Code § 4030.  Persons strip\n13 searched multiple times by virtue of multiple bookings during the Class Period, or strip searched at\n14 both the Maguire Correctional Facility and Women’s Correction Center during any one booking, will\n15 receive additional compensation for up to the first three (3) booking strip searches and may qualify\n16 for additional Tier 2 or Tier 3 payments depending upon responses to questions on the Claim Form.\n17 The settlement amounts specified herein are in-line with settlements typically paid in class\n18 action cases.  \n19 M. Advantages of Settlement\n20 Many of the persons entitled to compensation under this settlement agreement would have\n21 difficulty establishing that the damages they suffered exceeded the amounts they will receive under\n22 this settlement.  Because the value of each claim is minimal, in the absence of this class action\n23 settlement, few persons would be expected to come forward to file their own challenges to\n24 defendants’ strip search policies and procedures and would receive no compensation.  \n25 On the other hand, if the matter is not settled and were to proceed through litigation to trial,\n26 multiple trials could take years to complete and appeals thereafter would delay ultimate satisfaction\n27 of any judgments for several more years making settlement and resolution, as provided in the\n28 accompanying documents, desirable, appropriate and just.\nPAGE 13 OF 14\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v.

They also revised their practice to ensure that women arrested on felony charges were\n18 not subject to blanket strip searches at the Maguire Correctional Facility unless there was individual,\n19 reasonable suspicion for such strip search based upon the arrest charge or other factors.  A copy of\n20 Defendants’ revised policies is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.\n21 Plaintiffs moved for class certification and, on October 28, 2005, the Honorable Saundra\n22 Brown Armstrong issued her Order certifying the action to proceed as a class action with the classes\n23 defined as follows:\n24 a.

The Parties will take all necessary and appropriate steps to obtain preliminary approval of\n2 the Stipulation of Settlement, final approval of the settlement, and dismissal of the actions\n3 with prejudice.  If the Court finally approves this Stipulation of Settlement, and if there is an\n4 appeal from such decision, the Defendants will actively cooperate with Plaintiffs in joint\n5 efforts to defend the Stipulation of Settlement.\n6 IV.\n7 RESOLUTION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES\n8 29. The Settlement Fund which shall be used to pay all claims of SCMs, administrative costs and\n9 attorneys’ fees shall not be more than $1,900,000 (One Million, Nine Hundred Thousand\n10 Dollars).  The total settlement amount will be divided into three separate amounts:  (1) up\n11 to $1,150,000 (One Million, One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars) will be allocated to pay\n12 verified claims; (2) $600,000 (Six Hundred Thousand Dollars) will be allocated for\n13 “attorneys’ fees” for fees and costs incurred by Class Counsel; and (3) up to $150,000 (One\n14 Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars) will be allocated to the “administration fund” to cover the\n15 costs of claims administration to process and administer the settlements.  If the total amount\n16 of all valid claims, including the distribution to the named plaintiffs as set forth in\n17 Paragraph 30 exceeds $1,150,000 (One Million, One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars), the\n18 amount payable to SCMs for each claim shall be reduced proportionately as set forth in\n19 Paragraph 63.  \n20 30. The named Plaintiffs SHANNON GALLAGHER, ROBERTA BAUCCIO, and GRACE\n21 CARLAND shall be entitled to a distribution of $120,000 (One Hundred Twenty Thousand\n22 Dollars) from the payment fund of up to $1,150,000 (One Million, One Hundred Fifty\n23 Thousand Dollars) to pay verified claims.  The distribution to the named plaintiffs shall not\n24 be reduced proportionately if the total of all valid claims, including the distribution to the\n25 named plaintiffs, exceeds $1,150,000 (One Million, One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars).\n26 31. No payment shall be made to eligible SCMs before the Effective Date.  Claims may be\n27 processed between the date of preliminary Court approval and the Effective Date.  Claims\n28 will only be paid after all verified Claims have been calculated and all disputes relating to\nPAGE 9 OF 18\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\n00468608.WPD STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-3     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 11 of 54(cid:10)\n1 Claims have been resolved. Once all verified claims have been calculated and all disputes\n2 relating to claims have been resolved, then the Claims Administrator will provide Class\n3 Counsel and Counsel for Defendants with the calculations and total amount to be paid to\n4 SCMs.  Thereafter, the County or its designee will cause that amount, up to a total of\n5 $1,150,000 (One Million, One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars), to be placed in an account\n6 designated by the Claims Administrator.  The Claims Administrator will then disburse all\n7 appropriate amounts to SCMs, including the representative Plaintiffs.\n8 32. No payment shall be paid to Class Counsel for fees and costs before the Effective Date as\n9 more fully described in Paragraph 68.\n10 33. The Parties agree to make an application to the Court to appoint the Claims Administrator\n11 as an officer of the Court for the purpose of implementing the terms of the Stipulation of\n12 Settlement.  The Administrator shall be subject to judicial immunity to the fullest extent\n13 permitted by law.\n14 V.\n15 PROCEDURES FOR RECEIVING PAYMENT \n16 UNDER THIS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n17 34. All SCMs upon return of a verified Claim Form shall, for each booking up to a maximum\n18 of three (3) bookings, receive the following payments:\n19 Tier 1 Payments\n20 The Administrator will determine the amount of each Tier 1 payment based on the SCM’s\n21 responses to the Claim Form and the database provided by the County.\n22 a. If they were booked into McGuire Correctional Facility and transferred to the\n23 Women’s Correctional Center, prior to arraignment, a base sum of $2,500;\n24 b. If they were booked and released from McGuire Correction Facility, without being\n25 transferred to the Women’s Correctional Center, a base payment of $1,250.\n26 \\\\\\\n27 \\\\\\\n28 \\\\\\\nPAGE 10 OF 18\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v.

SCMs who seek more than the basic payments provided pursuant to Tier 1 shall have their\n5 claims determined in accordance with the criteria set forth below relating to Tiers 2 and 3.\n6 Requirements for Being Considered for Tier 2 Payments\n7 36. In order to be considered for a Tier 2 payment, the SCM must answer applicable questions\n8 1 through 5 in the Claim Form and provide substantiating detail in accordance with the\n9 instructions in the Claim Form.  \n10 37. The Administrator will determine the amount of each Tier 2 payment based upon a point\n11 allocation resulting from the Administrator’s review of the SCM’s responses to questions 1\n12 through 5 in the Claim Form, and the substantiating detail provided by the SCM, subject to\n13 reduction as set forth in Paragraphs 54-57.\n14 38. Points, as designated below, will be awarded if information in the database provided to the\n15 Administrator by Defendants, and SCM’s responses to questions and/or substantiating detail\n16 show the following:\n17 (cid:67) The SCM was under age 21 or over age 60  2 points\n18 (cid:67) The SCM had a physical or mental disability \n19 at the time of search 2 points\n20 (cid:67) The SCM was pregnant at the time of search 2 points\n21 (cid:67) The SCM was required to remove religious garments, \n22 piercings in a private area, or hair extensions during search 2 points\n23 (cid:67) The SCM was menstruating at time of search 4 points\n24 39. Each SCM shall be awarded $250 (Two Hundred Fifty Dollars) for each verified point.\n25 However, no SCM may receive an award in Tier 2 of more than $3,000 (Three Thousand\n26 Dollars) regardless of the total number of points awarded in Tier 2.  \n27 40. The Administrator will review the responses to questions 1 through 5 submitted by the SCM\n28 based on a set criteria agreed upon by Class Counsel and counsel for Defendants.  The\nPAGE 11 OF 18\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\n00468608.WPD STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-3     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 13 of 54(cid:10)\n1 Defendants may challenge the information and/or substantiating detail submitted by an SCM\n2 in support of answers to questions 1 through 5 in the Claim Form.  In the event Defendants\n3 challenge a submission, or the Administrator cannot determine if an SCM has sufficiently\n4 met the criteria for a Tier 2 category, the matter will be resolved by a two step process.  First,\n5 counsel for Defendants and Class Counsel will attempt to resolve the matter by meet and\n6 confer conference.  Any agreement between counsel shall be binding on the SCM.  In the\n7 event counsel cannot resolve the matter, the Magistrate Judge/Special Master will review the\n8 claim and make the final determination.  The Special Master may be present at the meet and\n9 confer conference and make a final determination at that time.  \n10 41. Tier 2 awards will be in addition to the basic award under Tier 1.\n11  Requirements for Obtaining Tier 3 Payments\n12 42. SCMs participating in Tier 3 must complete and execute the Claim Form.  Additionally, an\n13 SCM participating in Tier 3 must provide all documentation requested in support of a Tier\n14 3 award including, but not limited to, medical documentation and authorizations for release\n15 of all applicable medical and psychiatric records.  Tier 3 awards will be determined based\n16 upon the agreed upon criteria for evaluating all of the following which are available:  (i) Any\n17 documentation provided by the SCM, including but not limited to the SCM’s medical and/or\n18 psychological records; (ii) Statements submitted under penalty of perjury.  The Administrator\n19 will review the records and documents submitted, determine if the SCM is entitled to a Tier\n20 3 award and make an appropriate award.\n21 43. In the event Defendants challenge a submission, or the Administrator cannot determine if an\n22 SCM has sufficiently met the criteria for a Tier-3 category, the matter will be resolved by a\n23 two-step process.  First, Counsel for Defendant and Class Counsel will attempt to resolve the\n24 matter by meet and confer conference.  Any agreement between counsel shall be binding on\n25 the SCM.  In the event counsel cannot resolve the matter, the Special Master will review the\n26 claim and make the final determination.  The Special Master may be present at the meet and\n27 confer conference and make a final determination at that time.\n28 \\\\\\\nPAGE 12 OF 18\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-0448 SBA\n00468608.WPD STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 56-3     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 14 of 54(cid:10)\n1 44. If the Defendants challenge any Tier 3 award, which is above the minimum, they may require\n2 the Tier 3 claimant to submit to a deposition and/or agreed medical evaluation (“AME”) paid\n3 for by the Defendants.  Following the deposition and/or AME, the additional information\n4 relating to the challenged Tier 3 claims will be submitted to the Special Master for decision.\n5 45. The Special Master shall determine whether the SCM’s certified records, deposition\n6 testimony, psychological examination, and other material in the Administrator’s record of\n7 the Tier 2 determination show that it is more likely than not that the Tier 3 SCM suffered\n8 mental or emotional distress that was proximately caused by the strip search.  The\n9 demonstrated emotional distress must be greater or last longer than would normally be\n10 expected for persons exposed to the factors identified by the SCM in response to Tier 2\n11 questions.\n12 46. If the Special Master’s analysis of the certified medical records, psychological records and/or\n13 the deposition show that the SCM has not experienced the requisite injury, the SCM will\n14 receive only the minimum Tier 3 payment for which the SCM qualifies.  \n15 47. If the Special Master determines that the SCM sought therapy as a result of the strip search,\n16 the Tier 3 award may be between $2,500 (Two Thousand, Five Hundred Dollars) and $5,000\n17 (Five Thousand Dollars).  In order to qualify for this award, the SCM must have attended the\n18 first therapy session within 90 days of the strip search.  Additionally, in order to receive more\n19 than $2,500 (Two Thousand, Five Hundred Dollars), the SCM must have attended three (3)\n20 or more therapy sessions as a result of the strip search.  The amount determined shall be in\n21 the sole discretion of the Special Master. Neither Party shall have the right to appeal an\n22 award under this paragraph to the District Court.  \n23 48. If the Special Master determines that the SCM was diagnosed with a psychological injury as\n24 a result of the strip search, the Tier 3 award may be between $7,500 (Seven Thousand, Five\n25 Hundred Dollars) and $25,000 (Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars).  In order to recover under\n26 this paragraph, the SCM must have attended the first therapy session or medical appointment\n27 within 90 days of the strip search, and have attended a total of no less than 5 (five) therapy\n28 sessions or medical appointments.  Neither Party shall have the right to appeal an award\nPAGE 13 OF 18\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v. COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al.

If the Special Master determines, by a preponderance of evidence, that the SCM has suffered\n3 other significant ill effects as a result of the strip search, he may award between $0 (Zero\n4 Dollars) and $25,000 (Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars) to the SCM.  In order to recover an\n5 award under this paragraph, the SCM must show that the strip search has harmed her in a\n6 manner not contemplated in Tier 2 or the categories that support other recovery in Tier 3. \n7 50. If the SCM fails, without good cause, to provide all required records and/or authorizations,\n8 fails to appear for a scheduled deposition or examination, or otherwise fails to comply with\n9 orders of the Special Master, she will receive no Tier 3 payment. \n10 51. The Administrator, upon the request of the Special Master, may communicate with SCMs\n11 to obtain all authorizations and records and to schedule examinations and depositions.\n12 52. Tier 3 payments will be in addition to any payments awarded pursuant to Tiers 1 and 2.\n13 53. Tier 1 to 3 awards may be combined for a maximum payment of $30,500 (Thirty Thousand\n14 Five Hundred Dollars).\n15 VII.\n16 REDUCTION CATEGORIES\n17 54. The amounts payable to an SCM under Tiers 2 and 3 shall be subject to the reduction\n18 categories set forth below.  \n19 55. The County will exercise right to recover up to 50% of the awards under Tiers 2 and 3 for\n20 any Debts Owed to the County as described in Paragraph 9.\n21 56. An award otherwise payable to an SCM under Tiers 2 and 3 will be reduced by 75%\n22 (seventy-five percent) if, within 5 (five) years preceding the strip search, the SCM was\n23 sentenced to and incarcerated in County Jail or State Prison. This reduction will apply if\n24 SCM responds affirmatively to question 6 on the Claim Form or the appropriate database\n25 established that a SCM was sentenced and incarcerated as described.\n26 57. The Claims Administrator will provide a database of all SCMs who submit a Claim Form\n27 that identifies each SCM and the maximum Tier awards to Defendants in order permit\n28 Defendants to determine whether a payment to an SCM is subject to any reduction\nPAGE 14 OF 18\nSHANNON GALLAGHER, et al. v.

If Defendants determine that a payment to an SCM is subject to a reduction\n2 category, then it will provide the necessary information to the Claims Administrator so that\n3 the reduction may be applied.  In the event an SCM owes a debt to the County of San Mateo,\n4 as defined in Paragraph 9, then the Claims Administrator shall pay that amount on behalf\n5 of the SCM to the County of San Mateo at the time of distribution of the settlement funds\n6 to Claimants.\n7 VIII.\n8 GENERAL CLAIM PROCEDURES\n9 58.

SCMs who submit claims will be paid by check mailed to the address on the Claim Form or\n20 to the address specified by the SCM to which she wishes the payment mailed.\n21 62.

Within six months of her arrest, plaintiff SHANNON GALLAGHER filed a \n10  group government tort claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of \n11  said  claim  is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A,  and  incorporated  herein  to  the  extent \n12  relevant by this reference).    Plaintiff GALLAGHER’s group claim was denied on or \n13  about January 15, 2004 allowing the filing of this Complaint. \n14    19.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants \n15  routinely  follow  their  policy,  practice,  and  custom  of  subjection  pre-arraignment \n16  detainees, including, plaintiffs, to strip and visual body cavity searches without having, \n17  and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search will be productive of \n18  contraband or weapons. \n19    20.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants \n20  have the ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, \n21  while  in  defendants’  custody,  at  the  San  Mateo  Jail  since  July  10,  2000,  were \n22  subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment \n23  without  defendants  first  having,  and  recording,  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the \n24  searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n25    21.  Defendant SHERIFF DON HORSLEY is personally responsible for the \n26  promulgation  and  continuation  of  the  strip  search  policy,  practice,  and  custom \n27  pursuant to which some of the plaintiffs herein were subjected to searches complained \n28  of herein. \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, \n2  each of the plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of \n3  privacy,  and  violation  of  due  process  of  law  and  state  and  federal  statutory  and \n4  constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to proof, but, at a \n5  minimum, $1,000 as specified in California Penal Code § 4030 (p) and $4,000 as \n6  specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b). \n7  CLASS CLAIMS \n8     23.  The  strip  and  visual  body  cavity  searches  to  which  plaintiff  were \n9  subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants \n10  SHERIFF  HORSLEY,  COUNTY  OF  SAN  MATEO  SHERIFF’S  DEPARTMENT, \n11  COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, and the individual deputies sued herein by the fictitious \n12  names 1 through 150.  The searches complained of herein were performed without \n13  regard  to  the  nature  of  the  alleged  offense  for  which  plaintiff  had  been  arrested, \n14  without regard to whether or not plaintiff were eligible for cite and release under Penal \n15  Code sec 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiff was eligible for and/or were \n16  released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of herein \n17  were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintiff so \n18  searched possessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a \n19  reasonable belief that the searches would produce contraband, and those facts being \n20  articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.  \n21  24.  Plaintiff brings this action on her own behalf and on behalf of all persons \n22  similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California \n23  Code of Civil Procedure sec 382.   \n24  25.  The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and \n25  including July 10, 2003, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated \n26  and the practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-\n27  arraignment  strip  and/or  visual  body  cavity  search  at  the  San  Mateo  Jail  without \n28  defendants having, and recording, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n3  members of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  \n4  Plaintiff does not know the exact number of class members.  Plaintiff is informed and \n5  believe, and thereupon allege, that there are more than 100 persons per day who are \n6  arrested  by  defendants  and/or  in  the  custody of defendants and subjected to the \n7  searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom \n8  relating to said searches.  Plaintiff is informed and believe, and therefore allege, that \n9  there are tens of thousands of persons in the proposed class. \n10  27.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff \n11  is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact \n12  common to the class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely \n13  subject all persons arrested to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they \n14  intend such persons to be housed in a San Mateo County Jail; (2) whether persons \n15  are subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment without there being \n16  any  reasonable  suspicion,  based  on  specific  or  articulable  facts,  to  believe  any \n17  particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities \n18  which could be detected by means of a visual body cavity search; (3) whether the \n19  visual body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches \n20  cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches, or whether the visual \n21  body cavity searches are conducted in groups and/or in open areas where they may \n22  be observed by persons not participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the visual \n23  body cavity searches are reasonably related to defendants’ penological interest to \n24  maintain the security of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for \n25  protecting any such interest.  \n26  28.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff \n27  is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law \n28  common to the class including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n14  claims of the representative plaintiff are typical of the class.  Plaintiff was searched, \n15  prior to arraignment, without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity \n16  search would produce drugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting \n17  any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-approved writing).  Representative \n18  plaintiff has the same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the \n19  class members.  Plaintiff’s claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice, and \n20  custom  of  subjecting  arrestees  to  strip  and/or  visual  body  cavity  searches  before \n21  arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the \n22  search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff’s claims are based \n23  upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each class member \n24  suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity search. \n25  The actual damages suffered by representative plaintiff are similar in type and amount \n26  to the actual damages suffered by each class member.   \n27  30.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n28  representative plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \n3  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n4  risk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \n5  class would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the \n6  class.   \n7     32.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \n8  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n9  risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which \n10  would, as a practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other \n11  members of the class to protect their interests. \n12  33.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(2), \n13  plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have acted \n14  on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final \n15  injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.   \n16  34.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this \n17  class  action  is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  equitable \n18  adjudication of the controversy between the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, \n19  and  thereupon  alleges,  that  the  interests  of  members  of  the  class  in  individually \n20  controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class members \n21  would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiff is informed and \n22  believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small \n23  that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and \n24  thereupon alleges, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \n25  represent them.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is \n26  desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the \n27  same location; i.e., the COUNTY OF SAN MATEO.  It will promote judicial efficiency to \n28  resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff \n3  is  informed  and  believes,  and  thereupon  alleges,  that  the  identities  of  the  class \n4  members may be ascertained from records maintained by the COUNTY OF SAN \n5  MATEO and defendant SHERIFF DON HORSLEY and defendant COUNTY OF SAN \n6  MATEO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon \n7  alleges,  that  defendants’  records  reflect  the  identities,  including  addresses  and \n8  telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in the San Mateo \n9  Jails.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records of, and \n10  maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity \n11  search,  when  the  search  occurred,  where  the  search  occurred,  whether  any \n12  reasonable  suspicion  for  the  search  existed  and  was  recorded  in  a  supervisor-\n13  approved writing, when persons searched were arraigned, the charges on which such \n14  persons were arrested, and what treatment they received while so confined.  Plaintiff is \n15  informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that all of the foregoing information is \n16  contained  in  defendants’  computer  system  and  that  the  information  necessary  to \n17  identify the class members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for \n18  their  arrests  and/or  release  from  custody,  is  readily  available  from  said  computer \n19  system.   \n20  36.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class \n21  members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, \n22  including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable \n23  effort.    Plaintiff  is  informed  and  believes,  and  thereupon  alleges,  that  defendants’ \n24  computer  records  contain  a  last  known  address  for  class  members.    Plaintiff \n25  contemplates that individual notice will be given to class members at such last known \n26  address by first class mail.

Having read and considered the arguments presented by the parties in the papers\nDis strict  14\n  Di submitted to the Court, the Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without a hearing.  The\ntates orthern  15 Court hereby GRANTS Plaintiff Shannon Gallagher's Motion for Class Certification [Docket No. 14].\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 BACKGROUND\ni\nn\nA. Factual Background\nU\n18\n1. Parties\n19\nPlaintiff Shannon Gallagher (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Gallagher\"), and all those similarly situated, are\n20\nCalifornia residents who are citizens of the United States and who were allegedly arrested and\n21\ncompelled to comply with strip and/or visual body cavity searches1 at any and all San Mateo County\n22\nJails prior to being arraigned, without the County of San Mateo or its employees first having, and\n23\nrecording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would produce contraband or weapons.\n24\nCompl. at ¶¶ 2-9. \n25\n26\n1Pursuant to the California Penal Code, a strip search or visual body cavity search is \"a\n27\nsearch which requires a person to remove or arrange some or all of his or her clothing so as to permit\na visual inspection of the underclothing, breasts, buttocks, or genitalia of such person.\"  Cal. Penal\n28\nCode § 4030(c).\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 2 of 16(cid:10)\n1 Defendant County of San Mateo Sheriff Don Horsley is the duly elected sheriff of the county\n2 of San Mateo responsible for administering the jail facilities and for producing, overseeing, and\n3 implementing the policies, practices, and customs relating to the operation of the San Mateo Jail.  Id.\n4 at ¶¶ 10-14.\n5 Defendant County of San Mateo is a division of the state of California that allegedly adopted\n6 and maintained an official policy or custom or practice that \"authorize[d] by its terms the strip/visual\n7 body cavity search of any prisoner . . . being placed into the jail population where inmates are assigned\n8 to live for twenty-four hours or longer.\"  Pl's Mot. at 5.  Defendant San Mateo County Sheriff's\n9 Department also allegedly maintained or permitted this policy or custom or practice.  Id. at ¶ 9.2    \n10 2. Allegations\nt 11 On July 10, 2003, a member of the Pacifica Police Department arrested Gallagher in the city of\nr\nu\no a 12 Pacifica, pursuant to a three-year-old San Francisco County traffic warrant for driving on a suspended\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 license.  Compl. at ¶¶ 15-18.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 At the time of her arrest, however, Gallagher claims that she possessed a valid driver's license,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 which had been issued to her nine months earlier.  Id. at ¶¶ 19-21.  Gallagher was nonetheless arrested\nS N 16 and transported to the Pacifica Police Department where she remained in a holding cell for a short\nted  For the  17 period of time.  Id. at ¶¶ 20-22.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 Subsequently, pursuant to County of San Mateo policy and practice, Gallagher was transported\n19 to the McGuire Correctional Facility (\"MCF\") in downtown Redwood City.  Compl. at ¶ 23; Decl. of\n20 Mark E. Merin (\"Merin Decl.\") at Ex. B (Gallagher Depo. at 23:20-26:5) and Ex. C (Trindle Depo. at\n21 20:8-17).  While at MCF, Gallagher was allegedly subjected to a strip/visual body cavity search.\n22 Compl. at ¶¶ 24-25; Merin Decl. at Ex. B (Gallagher Depo. at 35:14-19).    \n23 After remaining at MCF for approximately three hours, Gallagher was allegedly handcuffed and\n24 placed in a van to be transported to the San Mateo Women's Correctional Facility (\"WCF\").  Compl.\n25 at ¶¶ 27-28; Merin Decl. at Ex. B (Gallagher Depo. at 45:20-46:12).  At WCF, any woman who was\n26\nadmitted to the facility and unable to make bail was subjected to a strip/visual body cavity search before\n27\n2Don Horsley, the County of San Mateo, and the San Mateo County Sheriff's Department are\n28\ncollectively referred to herein as \"Defendants.\"\n2\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 3 of 16(cid:10)\n1 being released to the general population of the facility.  See Merin Decl. at Ex. G (Peters Depo. at 12:8-\n2 13:1).  Accordingly, Gallagher was once again compelled to comply with a strip/visual body cavity\n3 search.  Compl. at ¶¶ 1-2; Merin Decl. at Ex. B (Gallagher Depo. at 45:20-46:12).    \n4 During both of the alleged visual body cavity searches, Gallagher was required to expose her\n5 genitalia and other private parts of her anatomy and was then left standing naked for a period of time.\n6 Id. at ¶¶ 3-5.  She remained at WCF for several hours before being released on bail.  Id. at ¶¶ 6.\n7 Although Gallagher received a court date of August 18, 2003, to take place in San Francisco County,\n8 the charges against her were subsequently dropped.  Id. at ¶¶ 7-8. \n9 B. Procedural Background\n10 Gallagher filed an administrative group government tort claim within six months of her arrest,\nt 11 for herself and for all other persons similarly situated.  Compl. at ¶¶ 9-13.  The group tort claim was\nr\nu\no a 12 denied on or about January 15, 2004.  Id.  On February 3, 2004, Gallagher filed the instant Class Action\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Complaint (\"Complaint\").  The Complaint is brought on behalf of Gallagher and all persons similarly\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 situated, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California Code of Civil\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Procedure § 382, and is brought against San Mateo County, the San Mateo Sheriff's Department, and\nS N 16 San Mateo County Sheriff Don Horsley.  The Complaint alleges the following causes of action: (1)\nted  For the  17 violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, brought pursuant\ni\nn\nU\n18 to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) violation of the California Constitution, brought pursuant to California Civil\n19 Code §§ 52 and 52.1; (3) violation of California Penal Code § 4030.3       \n20 Gallagher's Motion for Class Certification was filed on April 22, 2005.  Defendants filed an\n21 opposition to Gallagher's motion on May 17, 2005.\n22 After  receiving  Gallagher's  Motion  for  Class  Certification,  Defendants'  Opposition,  and\n23 Gallagher's Reply Brief, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing regarding the start\n24\n25 3The California legislature enacted California Penal Code § 4030 after discovering that\n\"some present search practices violate state and federal constitutional rights to privacy and freedom\n26\nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures.\"  Cal. Penal Code § 4030(a).  Accordingly, the statute\nprovides a civil remedy for individuals who were \"arbitrarily subjected to unnecessary strip and\n27\nbody cavity searches after arrests for minor misdemeanor and infraction offenses.\"  Id.  An\nindividual initiating a valid claim alleging violation of Section 4030 may potentially recover actual\n28\ndamages or one thousand dollars, whichever is greater.\n3\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 4 of 16(cid:10)\n1 and end dates for each of Gallagher's proposed classes.  See June 6, 2005 Order. \n2 LEGAL STANDARD\n3 Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which sets forth a two-step\n4 procedure.  First, the Court must determine that the following four requirements of Rule 23(a) have been\n5 satisfied: (1) numerosity; (2) common questions of law and fact; (3) typicality; and (4) fair and adequate\n6 representation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  Once these requirements are met, the plaintiff must also show that\n7 the lawsuit qualifies for class action status under one of the four possibilities found in Rule 23(b). The\n8 plaintiff bears the burden of proving that certification is appropriate.  See Hawkins v. Comparet-Cassani,\n9 251 F.3d 1230, 1238 (9th Cir. 2001).  \n10 Of the four criteria set forth in Rule 23(b), in the instant case, Gallagher alleges that Rule\nt 11 23(b)(3) is applicable.  Under Rule 23(b), the Court must find that the questions of law or fact common\nr\nu\no a 12 to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 controversy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b).  The matters pertinent to a finding under Rule 23(b)(3) include: (a)\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate\nS N 16 actions; (b) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by\nted  For the  17 or against members of the class; (c) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of\ni\nn\nU\n18 the claims in the particular forum; (d) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a\n19 class action.  Id.\n20 The Court maintains great discretion in certifying a class action.  Vizena v. Union Pac. R. R. Co.,\n21 360 F.3d 496, 502 (5th Cir. 2004).  The Court must rigorously analyze whether the class action\n22 allegations meet the requirements of Rule 23.  See General Telephone Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon,\n23 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982).  However, \"[b]ecause the early resolution of the class certification question\n24 requires some degree of speculation . . . all that is required is that the Court form a 'reasonable judgment'\n25 on each certification requirement.\"  In re Citric Acid Antitrust Litig., 1996 WL 655791 *2 (N.D. Cal.\n26\n1996).  \"In formulating this judgment, the Court may properly consider both the allegations of the class\n27\naction complaint and the supplemental evidentiary submissions of the parties.\"  In re Citric Acid, 1996\n28\nWL 655791 at * 2.  The Court may also consider how the plaintiffs' claims will be tried.  Castano v. Am.\n4\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 5 of 16(cid:10)\n1 Tabacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 744 (5th Cir. 1996).     \n2 ANALYSIS\n3 In the instant case, Gallagher seeks an order certifying the following classes pursuant to Rule\n4 23(b)(3):\n5 1.  For the federal claim (\"Class One\"):\n6 All women who, from February 3, 2002 to December 2, 2003, were arrested on any\n7 charge (including felonies) not involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence,\n8 and not involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where consent to\n9 search is a condition of such probation), and who were subjected to a uniform and\n10 indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity search by defendants before arraignment\nt 11 at the San Mateo County Jail without any individualized reasonable suspicions that they\nr\nu\no a 12 were concealing contraband.  This class also includes all female arrestees who were\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 subjected  to  subsequent  blanket  strip  search  before  arraignment  after  the  initial\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 strip/visual body cavity search without any reasonable individualized suspicion that they\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 had subsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons.\nS N 16 2.  For the state law claim (\"Class Two\")4:\nted  For the  17 All female arrestees who, from June 12, 2003 to December 2, 2003, were arrested on an\ni\nn\nU\n18 infraction or misdemeanor charge and brought to the San Mateo County Jail and who\n19 were subjected to a uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity search\n20 before arraignment without written supervisorial authorization, as required under\n21\n22 4The Court notes that Gallagher refers to Class One as including both \"state\" and \"federal\"\nclaims.  There are two state law claims alleged in Gallagher's complaint: (1) claims relating to\n23\nviolations of the California Constitution brought under California Civil Code §§ 52 and 52.1; and (2)\nclaims brought under California Penal Code § 4030.  However, Defendants contend that California\n24\nCivil Code §§ 52 and 52.1 do not provide Gallagher with the right to bring a class action on behalf\nof other persons.  Indeed, Section 52.1 only provides that a plaintiff \"may institute and prosecute in\n25\nhis or her own name and on his or her own behalf.\"  Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1.  Since Gallagher\nprovides no response to Defendants' argument even though it is her burden to do so, and since\n26\nDefendants' argument appears to be correct, the Court concludes that the only state law claim that is\ncognizable as part of the class action litigation is Gallagher's California Penal Code § 4030 claim. \n27\nSince Gallagher concedes that this claim only affects \"Class Two,\" then \"Class One\" may recover\nfor Gallagher's federal claim only.  The Court's conclusion does not affect Gallagher's right to pursue\n28\nrecovery under California Civil Code §§ 52 and 52.1 individually.\n5\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 6 of 16(cid:10)\n1 California Penal Code § 4030(f). \n2 Each of the requirements for class certification are addressed below.  See General Telephone Co.\n3 of Southwest, 457 U.S. at 161 (A \"class action may only be certified if the trial court is satisfied, after\n4 a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of [Rule 23] have been satisfied.\"). \n5 A. Ascertainability.\n6 An implied prerequisite to certification is that the classes must be sufficiently defined.  See\n7 DeBremaeker v. Short, 433 F.2d 733, 734 (5th Cir. 1970).  An identifiable class exists if its members\n8 can be ascertained by reference to objective criteria.  See, e.g., id. at 734-35 (court declined to certify\n9 a class made up of Texas residents \"active in the peace movement\" because identification of members\n10 was dependent on their subjective states of mind).  Class members need not be ascertained prior to\nt 11 certification, but \"the exact membership of the class must be ascertainable at some point in the case.\"\nr\nu\no a 12 In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20497, at *65-66 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).  It must\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 thus be \"administratively feasible for a court to determine whether a particular individual is a member\"\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of the class.  Rios v. Marshall, 100 F.R.D. 395, 403 (S.D.N.Y. 1983).  \"The Court must be able to make\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 this determination without having to answer numerous fact-intensive questions.\"  Daniels v. City of New\nS N 16 York, 198 F.R.D. 409, 414 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).\nted  For the  17 In the instant matter, Gallagher requests that the Court certify two classes, Class One and Class\ni\nn\nU\n18 Two, and contends that both classes are sufficiently ascertainable.  Specifically, Gallagher notes that\n19 the eligibility of a female arrestee for membership in the proposed classes is objective and can be\n20 obtained from records and computer data maintained by Defendant San Mateo County.  See Merin.\n21 Decl. at Ex. E (Lunny Depo. at 59:21-60:12) (noting that the jail's computer indicates the charges on\n22 which the arrestee is booked and whether the arrestee was housed in a facility before arraignment).\n23 Gallagher also notes that, since the strip/body cavity search was indiscriminately applied, there would\n24 be no need to scrutinize individual files.5  Gallagher's arguments are well-supported.  Indeed, in a recent\n25 case before Judge Breyer, Bull v. City & County of San Francisco, C 03-1840, a similarly defined class\n26\n27 5Gallagher further contends that the number of women who were, in fact, searched on the\nbasis of documented, individualized suspicion will likely be very small and that such women will be\n28\nexcluded from the class.  \n6\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 7 of 16(cid:10)\n1 was found to be ascertainable and thus certifiable.  Further, as set forth below, since Gallagher has now\n2 provided start and end dates for the proposed classes, the Court finds that she has sufficiently satisfied\n3 the ascertainability prerequisite to certification.    \n4 1. Class One\n5 Specifically, Gallagher proposes that Class One shall have a start date of February 3, 2002 and\n6 an end date of December 2, 2003.  Class One consists of individuals asserting claims under the Fourth\n7 and Fourteenth Amendments pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  In Johnson v. State of California, 207 F.3d\n8 650, 653 (9th Cir. 2000), the Ninth Circuit determined that the applicable limitations period for federal\n9 civil rights actions is borrowed from the forum state's statute of limitations for personal injury actions.\n10 California Code of Civil Procedure § 335.1 provides that the applicable period of limitations is two\nt 11 years.  Because February 3, 2002 is approximately two years prior to the date Gallagher initiated her\nr\nu\no a 12 action, Gallagher proposes February 3, 2002 as the start date for Class One.  Gallagher proposes an end\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 date of December 2, 2003 because, according to Gallagher, this is the date \"when the custom of\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 indiscriminately and uniformly strip searching of female pre-arraignment arrestees was corrected.\"  Id.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Defendants do not oppose the proposed start or end dates.\nS N 16 2. Class Two\nted  For the  17 Class Two consists of individuals asserting claims under California Penal Code § 4030.  In\ni\nn\nU\n18 California, prior to maintaining a lawsuit against a public entity, a plaintiff is required to comply with\n19 the guidelines set forth in the California Tort Claims Act.  Pursuant to California Government Code §\n20 945.4 \"no suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action for\n21 which a claim is required to be presented . . . until a written claim therefor has been presented to the\n22 public entity and has been acted upon by the board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the\n23 board[.]\"  Additionally, California Government Code § 911.2 provides that, \"[a] claim relating to a cause\n24 of action for death or for injury to person or to personal property . . . shall be presented . . . not later than\n25 six months after the accrual of the cause of action.\"  Finally, section 945.6 requires, \"any suit brought\n26\nagainst a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to be presented . . . be\n27\ncommenced, if written notice [rejecting the claim] is given . . . not later than six months after the date\n28\nsuch notice is personally delivered or deposited in the mail.\"  Cal. Gov. Code § 945.6. \n7\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 8 of 16(cid:10)\n1 According to the California Court of Appeals in Schmidt v. Southern California Rapid Transit\n2 Dist., 14 Cal. App. 4th 23, 25-26 (1993), \"the combined effect of sections 911.2 and 945.6 is that a claim\n3 for a personal injury action against a public entity must be presented within six months of the injury;\n4 and if the claim is denied, suit must be filed within six months of the date of denial.\"  Id.\n5 In her Complaint, Gallagher alleges that she was injured on or about July 10, 2003.  She further\n6 alleges that she filed a group government tort claim on December 12, 2003.  The group tort claim was\n7 denied on or about January 4, 2004.  Gallagher commenced this class action on February 3, 2004.\n8 Gallagher therefore proposes June 12, 2003 as the start date for Class Two, which is six months before\n9 her tort claim was filed.   Defendants do not oppose June 12, 2003 as the start date.  Gallagher also\n10 proposes, and Defendants do not oppose, December 2, 2003 as an end date for Class Two.\nt 11 B. Federal Rule 23(a) Requirements.\nr\nu\no a 12 1. Numerosity\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Rule 23(a)'s first requirement is that the proposed classes must be so numerous that joinder of\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 all members is \"impracticable.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  \"Impracticable\" does not mean \"impossible,\"\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 and a plaintiff only need establish the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the class to\nS N 16 meet the numerosity requirement.  Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine Estates, Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 913-14\nted  For the  17 (9th Cir. 1964).  There is no set numerical cutoff; a court must examine the specific facts of each case\ni\nn\nU\n18 to determine whether numerosity has been satisfied.6  General Tel. Co. of the Northwest v. EEOC, 446\n19 U.S. 318, 329-30 (1980).  Moreover, a plaintiff need not allege the exact number of class members, \"but\n20 may instead [make a reasonable] estimate on the basis of the size of a disputed offering.\"  Brosious v.\n21 Children's Place Retail Stores, 189 F.R.D. 138, 145 (D.N.J. 1999). \n22 Given the proposed start and end dates for all claims initiated by both Class One and Class Two,\n23 Gallagher estimates that Class One may be comprised of at least 2,000 individuals.  Defendants, on the\n24\n25 6 Although neither Rule 23(a) nor the courts have imposed an absolute \"magic number,\"\nsome courts have held that numerosity may be presumed at a level of forty members.  See, e.g.,\n26\nConsolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995).  On the other hand,\nclasses of fifteen or fewer people have frequently been rejected as too small for certification.  See,\n27\ne.g., General Tel. Co., 446 U.S. at 329-30 (fifteen affected employees \"would be too small to meet\nthe numerosity requirement\"); Harik v. Cal. Teachers Ass’n, 298 F.3d 863, 872 (9th Cir. 2002)\n28\n(certification of classes of seven, nine, and ten members vacated on numerosity grounds).\n8\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 9 of 16(cid:10)\n1 other hand, estimate that the number of potential Class One members will not exceed 1,814 women\n2 arrestees.  For Class Two, Gallagher estimates that membership \"is certain to be greater than 200\"\n3 women.  Defendants estimate the number to be approximately 223 women.7 \n4 Regardless of whether the Court accepts Gallagher's estimates or Defendants' estimates, the\n5 number of potential class members for both classes is substantial and the Court therefore finds that the\n6 numerosity standard is clearly met in this case. \n7 2. Commonality\n8 To prevail on her Motion for Certification, Gallagher must also establish that there are \"questions\n9 of law or fact common to the class.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  As the Ninth Circuit stated in Hanlon v.\n10 Chrysler Corporation, 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998), the commonality requirements of Rule\nt 11 23(a) are less rigorous than the companion requirements of Rule 23(b)(3).  All questions of fact and law\nr\nu\no a 12 need not be common to satisfy the rule.  Id.  The existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies within\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the class.  Id.  Factual variations or individual differences concerning damages, for example, will\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 generally not defeat commonality.  See, e.g., Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 905 (9th Cir. 1975)\nS N 16 (differences in individual damage calculation insufficient to defeat commonality). \nted  For the  17 Here, according to Gallagher, \"the core common question of law is whether it was legal for the\ni\nn\nU\n18 defendants to follow a custom and/or policy of conducting blanket strip searches and visual body cavity\n19 searches of all female pre-arraignment arrestees arriving at the Women's Correctional Facility to be\n20 housed pending arraignment.\"  Gallagher further argues that given the standardized nature of the policy,\n21 \"each class member's claim hinges upon this single issue.\"  Defendants, on the other hand, claim that\n22 \"very few of the issues to be adjudicated are common to the entire class.\"  Instead, Defendants argue\n23 that certifying Plaintiffs' proposed classes would be inefficient since the Court would be forced to\n24\n25 7Gallagher has raised numerous factual objections to the evidence Defendants have submitted\nregarding numerosity and typicality.  However, in a motion for class certification, the Court may\n26\nconsider both the allegations of the complaint and any other \"material sufficient to form a reasonable\njudgment on each requirement\" of Rule 23.  See Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 900-01 & n.17\n27\n(9th Cir. 1975).  The materials submitted by Defendants are being considered for this limited\npurpose only and are not being considered as part of a determination of whether Gallagher's claims\n28\nhave merit.  Accordingly, Gallagher's factual objections are OVERRULED.  \n9\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 10 of 16(cid:10)\n1 examine each claim on a case-by-case basis to determine whether an officer legitimately possessed an\n2 individualized suspicion that a strip search of a specific potential class member would produce\n3 contraband. \n4 Defendants' arguments are without merit.  In an analogous case, Tardiff v. Knox County, 365\n5 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2004), the First Circuit reviewed a district court's grant of class certification for claims\n6 challenging the lawfulness of a blanket strip search policy.  The defendants in Tardiff similarly resisted\n7 certification on the basis of two potential complications.  Id. at 4.  The first concern was that the strip\n8 searches may have been lawful as to some groups of arrestees and not others.  Id.  The court, however,\n9 determined that defendants' concern was alleviated by narrowing the class and excluding individuals\n10 who had been arrested for drugs, weapons, or violent felonies, groups for which a strip search would\nt 11 arguably have been appropriately required.8  Id.  The second concern noted by the defendants in Tardiff\nr\nu\no a 12 was that, even if the potential class were to be narrowed, there might be individuals within the remaining\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 group of arrestees who were lawfully subjected to a strip search provided it was predicated on the basis\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of individualized, reasonable suspicion.  Id.  The First Circuit rejected this concern as unwarranted,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 given that the plaintiffs had alleged that the county had a policy of strip searching every arrestee.  Id.\nS N 16 at 5-6.    \nted  For the  17 Like the certified class in Tardiff, Gallagher alleges a standardized strip/visual body cavity\ni\nn\nU\n18 search procedure that was applicable to all female arrestees to be housed at the correctional facility.\n19 Since the policy was allegedly applied \"across the board,\" the need to scrutinize individual claims is\n20 obviated.  Gallagher has accordingly satisfied the commonality requirement.\n21 3. Typicality\n22 The third requirement of Rule 23(a) is typicality.  The typicality requirement focuses on the\n23 similarity between the lead plaintiff's legal theories and those of whom he or she purports to represent.\n24 Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, 118 F.3d 421, 426 (5th Cir. 1998).  As such, \"[t]he commonality and\n25 typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.\"  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158 n.13.  However,\n26\n“[t]ypicality refers to the nature of the claim . . . of the class representative, and not to the specific facts\n27\n8Here, there is no need for further modifications, as Plaintiff has already proposed\n28\nappropriately narrowed classes.  \n10\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 11 of 16(cid:10)\n1 from which it arose or the relief sought.”  See, e.g., Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508\n2 (9th Cir. 1992).  \n3 Here, to prove typicality, Gallagher must only establish that she is \"part of the class and\n4 possess[es] the same interest and suffer[ed] the same injury as the class members.\"  Id.; accord\n5 California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc. v. Legal Services Corp., 917 F.2d 1171, 1175 (9th Cir. 1990).\n6 A \"representative's claims are typical if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class\n7 members; they need not be substantially identical.\"  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  \n8 Defendants present three arguments in support of their position that Gallagher's claims are not\n9 typical: (1) Gallagher alleges that she was subjected to not just one – but two – strip searches; (2)\n10 potentially, Gallagher claims are against different defendants than the other members of the putative\nt 11 class; (3) Gallagher's injury is not typical of the other putative class members' injuries.   \nr\nu\no a 12 Defendants' first argument is without merit because the mere fact that Gallagher was searched\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 twice does not necessitate a finding that her claims are not typical.  It is Gallagher's second search at the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 WCF that makes her claim typical of the claims asserted by the rest of the members of the classes.  See\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020 (claims are typical if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent\nS N 16 class members and need not be substantially identical); see also Tardiff v. Knox County, 218 F.R.D. 332,\nted  For the  17 337 (D. Me. 2003) (\"Although there may be class members who were searched more than once and an\ni\nn\nU\n18 individualized examination of the impact of the searches on specific class members may be necessary,\n19 the potential for differing amounts of recovery does not automatically preclude class certification.\"). \n20 Defendants' second argument is equally unpersuasive.  Relying on La Mar v. H&B Novelty &\n21 Loan Company, 489 F.2d 461, 465 (9th Cir. 1973) as authority, Defendants argue that Gallagher, who\n22 has asserted causes of action against the County and Sheriff Horsley, cannot satisfy the typicality\n23 requirement since she cannot maintain a cause of action against other individual defendant officers who\n24 were not directly responsible for her injuries.  La Mar is inapposite, however.  In La Mar, the plaintiff\n25 had filed suit against \"all the pawn brokers licensed to conduct business under the laws of Oregon.\"  Id.\n26\nat 462.  Accordingly, the defendants in La Mar were a diverse group of private parties and entities, not\n27\nemployees of the same employer who were acting pursuant to the same policy and practice.  Further\n28\nDefendants overlook the fact that the La Mar court expressly carved out an exception for \"situations in\n11\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 12 of 16(cid:10)\n1 which all injuries are the result of a conspiracy or concerted schemes between the defendants at whose\n2 hands the class suffered injury\" and \"instances in which all defendants are juridically related in a manner\n3 that suggest a single resolution of the dispute would be expeditious.\"  Id. at 466.  Additionally, in the\n4 present suit, the named defendants are all currently persons or entities alleged to be directly responsible\n5 for Gallagher's purported injuries.  Accordingly, La Mar does not support a finding that class\n6 certification is inappropriate here.  \n7 Finally, Defendants' argument regarding the difference between Gallagher's potential injuries\n8 and other potential injuries recoverable by the class is misplaced.  Significantly, Defendants admit that\n9 Plaintiff is seeking emotional distress damages and statutory penalties, which damages are typical for\n10 the putative classes, and do not refute that the injuries suffered by Plaintiff giving rise to such damages\nt 11 are also typical of the class.  Additionally, \"[t]ypicality refers to the nature of the claim . . . of the class\nr\nu\no a 12 representative, and not to the specific facts from which it arose or the relief sought.\"  See, e.g., Hanon,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 976 F.2d at 508.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 In sum, none of Defendants' three arguments is availing. Gallagher was allegedly strip searched\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 pursuant to a blanket policy, custom and/or practice of San Mateo County.  Like Gallagher's claims, all\nS N 16 of the putative class members' claims hinge on the constitutionality of that same policy, custom, and/or\nted  For the  17 practice.  Accordingly, Gallagher has satisfied the typicality requirement.\ni\nn\nU\n18 4. Adequacy of Representation\n19 The final requirement of Rule 23(a) is that Gallagher must be able to \"fairly and adequately\n20 protect the interests of the class.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Adequacy of representation assures due\n21 process of law to all unnamed class members; if a person is to be conclusively bound by a judgment\n22 prosecuted by a representative, he must have received adequate representation.  Hansberry v. Lee, 311\n23 U.S. 32, 42-43 (1940).  To establish adequacy of representation, Gallagher must show: (1) that her\n24 interests are common with, and not antagonistic to, the classes' interests; and (2) that she is \"able to\n25 prosecute the action vigorously through qualified counsel.\"  Lerwill v. Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc.,\n26\n582 F.2d 507, 512 (9th Cir. 1978).\n27\nHere, Gallagher has produced ample evidence that she would be an adequate representative of\n28\nthe proposed classes.  As set forth above, Gallagher's interests coincide with the classes' interests.\n12\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 13 of 16(cid:10)\n1 Further, the declarations of Gallagher's counsel demonstrate that they have sufficient experience and\n2 expertise to represent the proposed classes.  See Merin Decl. at ¶¶ 11-16; Decl. of Andy Schwartz\n3 (\"Schwartz Decl.\") at ¶¶ 5-10.  Further, Defendants' challenge to the adequacy of Gallagher's\n4 representation on the grounds that other members of the class may be subject to an exhaustion of\n5 administrative remedies defense under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") is unpersuasive.\n6 First, Defendants have not produced any evidence that any potential class member was in custody at the\n7 time of the filing of the Complaint.  Moreover, as Gallagher points out, the PLRA is not applicable to\n8 situations such as the instant proposed class action litigation.  See, e.g., Jones 'El v. Berge, 172 F.\n9 Supp.2d 1128, 1131-1134 (W.D. Wisc. 2001).  \n10 C. Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements\nt 11 Finally, before the classes can be certified, Gallagher must also show that at least one of the three\nr\nu\no a 12 requirements of Rule 23(b) is satisfied.  Amchem Prods. Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614-15 (1997).\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Here, Gallagher requests that the Court certify Class One and Class Two pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3)\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 because common questions predominate and class resolution is superior to other available methods for\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  \nS N 16 The objective behind the two requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) is the promotion of economy and\nted  For the  17 efficiency in actions that primarily involve monetary damages.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) (advisory\ni\nn\nU\n18 committee notes).  When common issues predominate, true economy may be achieved through the class\n19 action device, as time, effort and expense can be saved as compared to individual suits, and the\n20 confusion over differing outcomes can be avoided.  Id. \n21 Here, the substantive issue common to the class is Defendants' alleged liability for the County's\n22 strip search policy or practice, and the primary question to be resolved is whether Defendants' policy,\n23 custom, and/or practice of implementing blanket strip searches on all female arrestees to be housed in\n24 Defendants' correctional facilities violated certain federal constitutional rights and state statutory rights.\n25 The facts common to all proposed plaintiffs include being arrested for an offense not involving drugs,\n26\nweapons, or a felony charge of violence or for a misdemeanor, being booked at the McGuire\n27\nCorrectional Facility, being transferred to the San Mateo Women's Correctional Facility for housing,\n28\nand being subjected to a strip or body cavity search.  This combination of facts and law collaboratively\n13\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 14 of 16(cid:10)\n1 operate to determine Defendants' liability for adopting, maintaining and implementing the blanket strip\n2 search policies.  \n3 To resist certification under Federal Rule 12(3)(b), Defendants again raise the argument that the\n4 Court would be required to consider particularized facts concerning each search on a case-by-case basis,\n5 and that the Court would first need to determine whether a particular officer conducted the strip search\n6 based  on  individualized  reasonable  suspicion.    Defendants'  argument,  however,  is  undermined\n7 considerably by the fact that Defendants' own witnesses have admitted that no such individualized\n8 determinations were made.  See Merin Decl. at Ex. G (Peters Depo. at 12:8-25, 12:19-24).  Further,\n9 Defendants' argument that class certification is not appropriate because the Court would need to analyze\n10 \"particularized facts concerning each search\" has already been considered, and rejected, by other courts\nt 11 as unpersuasive.  See Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 13; Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 754 F.Supp. 1211, 1221 n.23\nr\nu\no a 12 (N.D. Ill. 1990).  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 While Defendants also argue that this Court should not certify this case as a class action because\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the Court may have to \"conduct a particularized assessment of damages for each putative class\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 member,\" class certification is not defeated merely because individualized damage issues may remain.\nS N 16 See Smilo v. South Western Bell Mobil Systems, 323 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Where . . . common\nted  For the  17 questions predominate regarding liability, then courts generally find the predominance requirement to\ni\nn\nU\n18 be satisfied even if individual damages issues remain.\").  Indeed, once liability issues have been\n19 determined, there are various methods available in a class action lawsuit that the Court may effectively\n20 use to resolve the various resulting damages issues.  \n21 In conclusion, it is clear to the Court that, in the instant case, a class action is far superior to\n22 multiple individual lawsuits.  The needless expenditure of additional time, effort and expense that would\n23 be attendant to numerous individual suits is greatly reduced, and the potential for differing outcomes\n24 is avoided as well.  As such, Gallagher has satisfied the criteria of Rule 23(a) and 23(b)(3), and class\n25 certification is appropriate.\n26\n///\n27\n///\n28\nCONCLUSION\n14\n\nCase 4:04-cv-00448-SBA     Document 29     Filed 10/31/2005     Page 15 of 16(cid:10)\n1 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Gallagher's Motion for Class Certification [Docket No. 14]\n2 is GRANTED.
