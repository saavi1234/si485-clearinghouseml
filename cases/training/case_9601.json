    "summary": "<p>On November 7, 1996, on behalf of two named plaintiffs, Chicago attorney Thomas G. Morrissey filed a civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, challenging the Cook County Sheriff's policy of strip searching female pretrial detainees upon returning to the Cook County Jail from court after there had been a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention, other than to be processed for release.   Plaintiffs alleged that the searches violated their rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Illinois state law.  They sought monetary damages, injunctive relief and class certification. </p><p>On March 17, 1997, the District Court (District Judge David H. Coar) entered a preliminary injunction, prohibiting the Sheriff's alleged strip search practice.   The case was certified as a class action on April 10, 1997, with the class defined as: \"All female inmates who have been or will be subjected to a strip search at the Cook County Department of Corrections (Jail) upon returning to the Jail from court after there is a judicial determination that there is no longer a basis for their detention, other than to be processed for release.\"</p><p>Litigation in the case continued over the next 5 years, with the District Court issuing a number of mostly electronically-published opinions.  These include Gary v. Sheahan, 1997 WL 201590 (N.D. Ill. Apr 18, 1997) (granting the Sheriff's motion to dismiss in part as to plaintiffs' claims under the Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Amendment); Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 WL 245875 (N.D. Ill. May 04, 1998) (NO. 96 C 7294) (denying plaintiffs' motion to show cause to hold the Sheriff in contempt for violating the preliminary injunction); Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 WL 249225 (N.D. Ill. May 04, 1998) (denying motion to bar plaintiffs from taking Sheriff Sheahan's deposition); Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 WL 547116 (N.D. Ill. Aug 20, 1998) (granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection claim and Fourth Amendment search and seizure claim); Gary v. Sheahan, 1999 WL 703628 (N.D. Ill. Aug 26, 1999) (awarding plaintiffs interim attorneys' fees in the amount of $367,539.08 and costs of $56,434.80);  Gary v. Sheahan, 1999 WL 281347 (N.D. Ill. Mar 31, 1999) (denying the Sheriff's motion to decertify the class)  (the Sheriff's appeal of this denial was dismissed as untimely in Gary v. Sheahan, 188 F.3d 891 (7th Cir. 1999) (Circuit Judge Frank H. Easterbrook));  Gary v. Sheahan, 1999 WL 1021040 (N.D. Ill. Nov 03, 1999) (entering permanent injunction prohibiting the Sheriff from strip searching female inmate court returnees who have been judicially discharged from the Cook County Department of Corrections); Gary v. Sheahan, 2000 WL 889785 (N.D. Ill. Jun 26, 2000) (granting plaintiffs interim attorneys' fees in the amount of $257,786 .60 and costs of $26,412.05); Gary v. Sheahan, 2001 WL 1155087 (N.D. Ill. Sep 27, 2001) (award of $183,372.43 in interim fees and $64,462.97 in interim costs); and Gary v. Sheahan, 2001 WL 1543514 (N.D. Ill. Nov 30, 2001) (awarding plaintiffs' attorneys fees in the amount of three million dollars and an award of costs in the amount of $45,398.81 for work in the cases Gary v. Sheahan, 96 C 7294; Wilkes v. Sheahan, 01 C 1592; Wells v. Sheahan, 95 C 5918; and Quarrels v. Sheahan, 96 C 1215, less the credit due defendant of $875,337.35 for prior payments of interim attorneys' fees) </p><p>The case was ultimately settled in 2001 for $6.8825 million.  Of that amount, 6 class representative were to receive incentive payments of $25,000 each.  Cook County agreed to pay plaintiffs' attorneys fees as ordered by the Court, in addition to the $6.8825 million.</p><p>The Court preliminarily approved the settlement on July 18, 2001 and issued an order of final judgment after a fairness hearing on September 18, 2001.  Settlement disbursement continued through the end of 2002.  We have no information about further activity in the case.</p><p></p>",

Pursuant to Rule 23 (c) (2), opt-\nout notices were sent to putative class members by first class mail.

Devine, State's Attorney of Cook County and through Assistant State's \nAttorney's Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Thomas M. Burnham and Michael D. Jacobs and submits this \nMotion of Defendant For Permission To Stop Payment On Certain Settlement Drafts, stating in \nsupport thereof as follows: \n1.  Since the final approval of the settlement reached in this class action lawsuit, in excess of \n3,000 drafts have been mailed or hand delivered to class members. \n2.  The vast majority of these drafts have been cashed; a small number of drafts have been \nreturned to the State's Attorney's Office as undeliverable. \n3.  One hundred and ninety-nine (199) drafts have neither been cashed nor returned to the \nState's Attorney's Office; those drafts are identified on the list attached to this motion. \n4.  Some class members have contacted the State's Attorney's Office regarding drafts that \nhave neither been cashed nor returned to the State's Attorney's Office.  Those class \nmembers have asked that new drafts be issued.  Such class members are indicated on the \nattached list by *. \n5.  Replacement drafts cannot be issued to those class members while there is still a \npossibility that the original draft will be cashed. \n6.  As nearly two months have passed since the issuance of the original drafts, any checks \nnot yet cashed or returned are either lost, in the hands of individuals other than the \nC;g~ \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 583     Filed 02/20/2002     Page 3 of 4(cid:10)\n-, \npayees, or in the hands of payees who hope to have a \"replacement check\" issued, which \nwill then be cashed along with the original. \n7.  Builder's Bank will place \"stop orders\" on the drafts identified on the attached list, but \nwill charge a service fee of $20.00 for each check for which a stop order is issued, \n8.  Therefore placing a stop order on each of the drafts on the attached list will cost \n$3,980.00, which will come from the settlement fund.  As the monies in the settlement \nfund are under the jurisdiction of the Court, it seemed prudent to seek an order from the \nCourt authorizing the defendant to direct Builder's Bank to stop payment on the drafts \nidentified on the attached list. \nWHEREFORE, the defendant, MICHAEL SHEAHAN, SHERIFF OF COOK COUNTY \nrequests the Court to enter an Order authorizing his attorney, RICHARD A. DEVINE, State's \nAttorney of Cook County to direct Builder's Bank to stop payment on the drafts identified on the \nattached list. \nRICHARD A. DEVINE \nState's Attorney of Cook County \nThomas M.

Morrissey and \nRobert H. Farley, Jr., and request this Honorable Court to order the County Comptroller to \nimmediately deposit the settlement funds into an interest bearing account and  to issue the checks \nto the class members prior to December 18,200 I. In support of this motion, the plaintiff class \nstates as follows: \n1.  The Final Judgment Order approving the settlement of this case pursuant to the \nSettlement Agreement was entered on September 18,2001. There were no appeals filed to this \nOrder. \n2.  Under the Settlement Agreement, the settlement funds are required to be distributed \nto the class within 30 days after the expiration of the time to Appeal. (Settlement Agreement par. \n8). \n5 / /  \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 571     Filed 11/28/2001     Page 3 of 5(cid:10)\n3.,  On November 1,2001, the parties appeared before the Court and the defendant \ninformed the Court that County Comptroller was  in the process of transferring the settlement \nfunds into an interest bearing checking accountant at a local bank and the funds would  be \ndistributed by the bank to the class members  within the next 30 days. \n4.  Through no fault of the attorneys for the defendant, the County Comptroller has not \ntransferred the funds, as required under the Settlement Agreement, into an interest bearing \naccount, and has not designated a bank to distribute the settlement funds to the class. The \nundersigned attorney has made numerous attempts to resolve this administrative problem with \nthe defendant without success over the last three weeks. \n5.  Regardless of whether the checks are distributed by a bank or the Comptroller, it \nwill take several weeks to format the computer records ofthe addresses of the class members \nprior to the mailing of the checksto the class members. \n6.  Under the Settlement Agreement, 3,0051  women are entitled to receive \ncompensation. Each day, the plaintiff's lawyer and his paralegal  receive over 50 calls during the \nday from class members and in excess of 50  voice mail messages, demanding to know when \nthey will receive their checks. With the holiday season rapidly approaching, these inquires have \nunderstandable become more frequent and intense. \n7.  In the class action case of Watson v.

Morrisey's (\"Morrisey\") and Robert H. \nFarley, Jr.'s (\"Farley\"), petition for attorney's fees and non-taxable expenses, dated July 16, \n2001.  For the following reasons, plaintiffs' counsel is awarded  in total an award offees in the \namount of three million dollars and an award of costs in the amount of$45,398.81, less the credit \ndue defendant of $875,337.35. \nDiscussion \nOn July 16, 2001, counsel for the plaintiff class submitted a petition for attorneys' fees \nand costs in the following cases: Gary v. Sheaha!!, 96 C 7294; Wilkes v. Sheahan, 1 C 1592; \nWells v. Sheahan, 95 C 5918; and Ouarrels v. Sheahan, 96 C 1215.  Under the Joint StipUlation \nof Settlement, the plaintiffs' attorneys fees and costs are to be determined by this court after the \ndefendant has been given an opportunity to respond to the plaintiffs' petition.  The defendant has \nso responded. \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 573     Filed 11/30/2001     Page 3 of 7(cid:10)\nStandard \nIn detennining the amount of attorney's fees and costs to award to the counsel for the \nprevailing party, the burden is on the party seeking the award to substantiate the hours worked \nand the rate claimed.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct 1933, 1939 (1983).  The \ndistrict court must review the fee request and has the discretion to increase or decrease the \namount in light of twelve factors.'  Id. at 429-30 n.3, 103 S.Ct. at 1937-38 n.3.  The court must \ngive a \"concise, but clear explanation\" for each modification to the proposed amount.  Smith v. \nGreat American Restaurants, Inc., 969 F.2d 430, 439 (7th Cir. 1992).  In analyzing the fee \nrequest, \"the most critical factor is the degree of success obtained.\"  Estate of Borst v. O'Brien, \n979 F.2d 511, 515 (7th Cir. 1992) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436,103 S.Ct. at 1941). \nAnalysis \nThe plaintiffs petition for attorneys fees argues that the plaintiffs' counsel's request for \nfees and costs is reasonable and in accord with fees granted in class action lawsuits.  This court \nagrees. \n1.  Hourly rate \nIn detennining the rate to award the plaintiffs' counsel, the court must look at \"the rates \ncharged by lawyers in the community of 'reasonably comparable skill, experience and \nreputation.'\" People Who Care v. Rockford Board of Education, 90 F.3d 1307, 1310 (7th Cir. \n, These factors include: (I) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of \nthe questions; (3) the skill requisite to perfonn the legal service properly; 4) the preclusion of \nemployment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the \nfee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the \namount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the \nattorneys; (10) the \"undesirability\" of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional \nrelationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.  Johnson v. Georgia Highway \nExpress, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974). \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 573     Filed 11/30/2001     Page 4 of 7(cid:10)\n1996).  The Seventh Circuit uses two methods to calculate fee awards: first is to use the current \nmarket rate; second is to base the award on the rate the attorney charged at the time services were \nrendered and then add interest.  Smith v. Village of Maywood, 17 F.3d 219, 221 (7th Cir. 1994). \nPlaintiffs' counsel presents evidence that the current market rate for his work is $317.75 \nper hour and that he has been recently awarded $335 per hour in a similar case.  The defendant \nargues that plaintiffs' attorneys have inappropriately \"enhanced\" their 36.5 hours out of7,140 \nhours of their fee award by \"multiplying\" their hourly rate. As support, the defendant states that \nat the onset oflitigation, Morrissey was charging $235.00 per hour for his time and Farley was \ncharging $225.00 per hour for his time.  Litigation, however, began in 1995.  The defendant does \nnot provide any evidence to support his conclusion that plaintiffs' attorneys should receive less \nthan $317.75.  People Who Care, 90 F.3d at 1314-15. \nIn this court's view, plaintiffs' attorneys have accurately adjusted their rates to reflect \ntheir current market rate, and therefore, this court awards plaintiffs' counsel attorney's fees at the \namount of $317.00 per hour. \n2.  Compensation for Two Attorneys \nThe Seventh Circuit has determined that a court's award of attorneys' fees for more than \none attorney's time at court appearances is \"eminently reasonable and well within its discretion.\" \nUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Mutual Trading Com., 63 F.3d 516, 520, 525 (7'h Cir. 1995). \nThe defendant argues that Farley should not be compensated for the 36.5 hours of time \nspent on court appearances, where Mr. Morrissey was also present.  Given the complex issues \npresented in these lawsuits, the presence of two attorneys was more than reasonable.  Moreover, \nthe defendant often had several lawyers present on his behalf and the plaintiff class was entitled \nto same advantage. \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 573     Filed 11/30/2001     Page 5 of 7(cid:10)\n3.  Calculation of Reasonable Fees \nFees awarded under Section 1988 may be calculated in a number of ways.  First, attorneys \nfees maybe awarded simply on the basis of the \"lodestar\" amount.  The lodestar is determined by \nmUltiplying the reasonable hourly rate times the reasonable number of hours.  City of Riverside \nv. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 568 (1986).  Alternatively, in class actions suits, attorneys fees may be \ncalculated based upon the lodestar amount and additional compensation resulting from the delay \nin payment of fees.  In re Continental Illinois Securities Litigatio!], 962 F.2d 556, 570-71 (7'h Cir. \n1992).  Courts awarding fees in the context of class actions have also applied a multiplier to the \nlodestar, in order to reflect the risk of losing the case and not being paid at all.  Price v. Marshall \nErdman & Associates, Inc., 966 F.2d 320,327-28 (7'h Cir. 1992). \nThe defendant argues that both the Supreme Court and the Seventh Circuit have held that \nuse of risk mUltipliers in fee-shifting cases is generally prohibited.  City of Burlington v. Dagu\" \n505 U.S. 557 (1992); Florin v. Nationsbank of Georgia, 34 F.3d 560, 564 (7'h Cir. 1994). \nWhile this court agrees with defendants that both Dague and Florin establish a general \nprohibition against the use of risk-multipliers in fee-shifting cases, the Seventh Circuit have held \nthat when a case is settled by the creation of a common fund, common-fund principles rather than \nan otherwise applicable fee-shifting statute govern the court's award of attorneys' fee. Florin, 34 \nF.3d at 560.  Consequently, we must first determine whether this case should be governed by \ncommon fund principles or by statutory fee-shifting principles. \nIn Skelton v. General Motors Com., 860 F.2d 250, 257 (7th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 493 \nU.S. 810, 110 S.Ct. 53, 107 L.Ed.2d 22 (1989), the Seventh Circuit held there that \"when a \nsettlement fund is created in exchange for release of the defendant's liability both for damages \nand for statutory attorney's fees, equitable fund principles must govern the court's award of the \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 573     Filed 11/30/2001     Page 6 of 7(cid:10)\nattorney's fees.\" Skelton, 860 F.2d at 256 (citing In re Fine Paper, 751 F.2d 562, 582-84 (3d \nCir.1984); Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Cor,p., 487 F.2d \n161, 164-65 (3d Cir.1973».  In this case, although the manner in which the defendant structured \nthe final settlement of this case did not result in a typical common fund, the settlement agreement \napproved by the court provides that upon a determination of reasonable attorneys fees and costs \nto be paid to the plaintiff, the defendant will be released from liability for both damages and any \nadditional statutory attorney's fees.  The settlement agreement anticipates that the amount paid to \nplaintiff class does not include an unspecified sum for class counsel's fees.  An award of \nattorney's fees from in addition to the fund would therefore be consistent with the goal of the \nfee-shifting provision to allow\" 'the offending party [to] bear the costs of the award rather than ... \nplan participants.' \" Bowen v. Southtrust Bank of Alabama, 760 F.Supp. 889,894 \n(M.D.Ala.199l) (citing Eaves v. Penn, 587 F.2d 453, 464 (10th Cir.1978».  Furthermore, an \naward of fees in addition to the settlement fund comports with the fee-shifting policy of enabling \nmeritorious plaintiffs who would not otherwise be able to afford to bring a lawsuit under ERISA, \nto pursue their claims.  Consequently, the award of attorney's fees and costs in this present case \nwill governed by common-fund principles. \nAs such, the Seventh Circuit has concluded that the holding in Dague does not extend to \nthose cases in which fees have been awarded as a common fund.  Florin, 34 F.3d at 564. \nCommon fund principles properly control a case which is initiated under a statute with a \nfee-shifting provision, but is settled with the creation of a common fund. Id.  Dague, by its \nterms, applies only to statutory fee-shifting cases, and its reasoning is largely based on the \nstatutory language of fee-shifting provisions.  Id \nTherefore, the court finds that plaintiffs' attorneys are entitled to receive in total an award \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 573     Filed 11/30/2001     Page 7 of 7(cid:10)\nof fees in the amount of three million dollars and an award of costs in the amount of$45,398.81, \nless the credit due defendant of $875, 337.35 for prior payments of interim attorneys' fees. \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, this court finds that plaintiffs' attorneys are entitled to receive \nin total an award of fees in the amount of three million dollars and an award of costs in the \namount of$45,398.81, less the credit due defendant of $875,337.35 for prior payments of \ninterim attorneys' fees.  As stipulated by the Order granting the parties' Joint Motion for \nApproval of Disbursement of Settlement Funds And An Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs, \ndated November 7,2001, fifty percent of the remaining attorneys' fees and one hundred percent \nof the remaining costs awarded must be paid within 30 days ofthis Memorandum Opinion and \nOrder.  The final fifty percent of attorneys' fees awarded must be paid within 90 days ofthe date \nof entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order. \nE  er: \nDavid H.

On December 18,2001, one of the attorneys for the Sheriff appeared before this \nCourt and represented that the checks would be promptly placed in the mail.

Morrissey, Ltd., and Robert H. Farley, Ltd., and the defendant, Michael Sheahan, \nSheriff of Cook County, by his attorney, Richard A. Devine, State's Attorney of Cook County, \nthrough his Assistant State's Attorneys Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Thomas M. Burnham and \nMichael Jacobs for approving distribution of the undistributed  Settlement Funds. This Court is \\. \nfully advised in the premises. \nWHEREAS on September 18,200 I, the Court entered a final judgment order approving \nthe settlement of this case. The Court retained jurisdiction for the purposes of enforcing the \npermanent injunction and  for considering further disbursements from the Settlement Funds in \n1 \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 618     Filed 10/22/2002     Page 3 of 6(cid:10)\naccordance with the Settlement Agreement. \nWHEREAS  pursuant to the Joint Stipulation of Settlement and Notice to the Class, \nputative class members were required to  have submitted a completed claim form by June 1,200 I \nand meet the eligibility requirements of the class. \nWHEREAS, due to the fact that many of the putative class members did not have \npermanent addresses and or/moved frequently, the Court ordered the defendant to provide \nextensive notice of the settlement and the requirement to file a claim card by 6111200 I  in \nnewspapers with general circulations throughout the metropolitan area and by posting notices in \nCounty Buildings and at the Cook County Jail. Additionally the defendant provided notice of the \nsettlement by first class mail to the last known addresses of the putative class members .. \nWHEREAS on November 7, 2001  an order was entered by the Court approving the \ndisbursement of the settlement funds by the County of Cook to a list of claimants  found by the \nCourt to be eligible to share in the settlement as members of the class. (Exhibit A). \nWHEREAS,  after the entry of the Court's Order of November 7,2001 and through \nOctober 10,2002 , the Court permitted woman who had not filed a timely claim card and \ntherefore were not included on the list of eligible class members, to file motions, supported by \naffidavits, stating the reason why they had not complied with the requirement of mailing a claim \nform by June 1,2001.  The Court for good cause found that the following individuals should be \nadded to the November 7, 200 I list of eligible class members. \nSashaLong \nMarie Williams \nVonda Wallace \nDenise Dailey \nPatrice Moore \n2 \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 618     Filed 10/22/2002     Page 4 of 6(cid:10)\nWHEREAS, the  settlement agreement provided for a cy pres distribution in the event \nthere remains undistributed money in the Settlement Funds. \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED: \n1.  This Court finds that the Notice provided to the class of the settlement and \nrequirements for filing a claim was the best notice practicable under the circumstances and \nprovided due and adequate notice to  all putative class members of the requirement to submit a \nclaim. \n2.  This Court further finds that putative class members who failed to comply with the \nmandatory requirement of submitting a claim card by June 1,2001, were provided sufficient \nopportunity to petition this Court and present evidence why they should be found to be eligible to \nparticipate in the settlement of this case. That in the interest of justice, finality and in accordance \nwith the Joint Settlement Agreement, this Court finds that there is no reason to delay the \ndistribution of the unclaimed settlement funds. \n3.  This Court finds that all claims by the  putative class members who are not included \non the amended list of November 7,2001 of eligible class members against the County of Cook, \nthe Office of the State's Attorney, the defendant and Class Counsel  are barred. \n4.  . This Court finds that the County of Cook and Class Counsel have caused settlement \nchecks to be sent by first class mail to the last known addresses of all class members found \neligible by this Court. The Court further finds that any and all claims against the County of \nCook, the Office of the State's Attorney, the defendant and Class Counsel by class members \narising after the checks were placed in the mail by the County of Cook including but not limited \nto checks lost in the mail, stolen, sent to a prior address of an eligible claimant,  cashed by other \n4 \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 618     Filed 10/22/2002     Page 5 of 6(cid:10)\n., \n~ \nthan the claimant, misplaced or which remain uncashed by the claimants as of the date of this \norder are barred. \n5.  The Court finds that the Office ofthe State's Attorney, and Class Counsel shall not \nbe liable for anything done or omitted in connection with this litigation, including but not limited \nto the sending Notices of Settlement to putative class members, and  the  administration of the \npayments to eligible class members. \n6.  That the County of Cook is ordered to retain  $44,220 of the settlement funds until \nDecember 3 I ,2002 for the purpose of distributing the checks to the class members  listed in \nExhibit Conly. lfthe checks are not claimed by the respective class members by December \n31,2002, the balance remaining in the settlement fund shall be distributed pro rata to the cy pres. \n7.  This Court has reviewed the accounting by the County ofC  ook in regards to the \ndistribution ofthe settlement funds and finds that there remains $ 305,238.64  available for cy \npres distribution. The Court therefore orders that cy pres distributions shaH be made as foHows: \nA  50% to the Jane Adams HuH House Association  $130,509.32 \nB.  50% to the McDermott Center, d/b/a Haymarket Center  $130,509.32 \n(D/~~ \ntrJJJ)~ \nDATED: \nJUDGE DAVID H.

Sheahan, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (1999)   \n \n \n   1  For a more detailed discussion of the facts of this case, \n1999 WL 281347 \n  see the Memorandum Opinion and Order dated August \nOnly the Westlaw citation is currently available.  19, 1998. \nUnited States District Court, N.D. Illinois, Eastern   \nDivision. \n \n \nKenya GARY and Tania Hayes, individually and on \nbehalf of a class, Plaintiffs, \nv. \nStandard for Class Certification \nMichael SHEAHAN, Sheriff of Cook County, in his \nindividual and official capacity, Defendant.  Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23 is the guideline for certification of a \nclass action suit. In order for a class to be certified, the \nNo. 96 C 7294. | March 31, 1999. \nmembers must meet the four requirements of Rule 23(a) \nand one of the parts of Rule 23(b). Wright, Miller & \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1759 \nOpinion \n(1986). Rule 23(a) is satisfied only if 1) the class is so \n \nnumerous that the joinder of all members is impracticable; \n2) there are common questions of law or fact; 3) the \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  claims  of  the  representative  parties  are  typical  of  the \nclaims of the class; and 4) the representative parties will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nCOAR, District J.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). To satisfy Rule 23(b), the action must \nbe such that 1) the prosecution of separate actions by or \n*1  Before  this  court  is  defendant  Michael  Sheahan’s \nagainst individual members of the class would create a \n(“defendant”  or  “Sheahan”)  motion  to  decertify  the \nrisk of incompatible or varying adjudications with respect \nplaintiff class with respect to damages against plaintiffs \nto the individual member or adjudications which would \nKenya Gary and Tania Hayes on the behalf of a class \nnecessarily  implicate  the  rights  of  other  members  not \n(“plaintiffs”  or  “class”).  For  the  following  reasons, \nparty to the action; 2) the opposing party has acted or \ndefendant’s motion is DENIED. \nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class \n  \nas a whole; or 3) the court finds that the questions of law \n \nor fact common to the members o the class as a whole \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual \nmembers and that a class action is the most efficacious \nBackground \nmethod of adjudication. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b). \n  \nThe plaintiffs Kenya Gary and Tania Hayes brought this \nClass  certification  under  Rule  23(b)(2)  is  appropriate \ncase against Michael Sheahan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on \nwhen  the  class  is  seeking  “final  injunctive  relief  or \nbehalf of the following certified class: \ncorresponding declaratory relief.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). \nIn contrast, Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate when there are \nAll female inmates who have been \ncommon questions of law and fact and the determination \nor  will  be  subjected  to  a  strip \nis superior to other available methods of resolution for \nsearch  at  the  Cook  County \nfairness and efficiency. Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal \nDepartment  of  Corrections  (Jail) \nPractice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1776; see also Bennett \nupon  returning  to  the  Jail  from \nv. Gravelle, 323 F.Supp. 203, 218 (D.C.Md.1971). \ncourt  after  there  is  a  judicial \n  \ndetermination  that  there  is  no \n \nlonger a basis for their detention, \nother  than  to  be  processed  for \nrelease. \nAnalysis \nThis court certified this class under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2)  *2  The  defendant’s  argument  for  decertification  is \nand 23(b)(3) in its Memorandum Opinion and Order dated  threefold.  First,  he  argues  that  class  certification  for \nApril 10, 1997. Soon after, plaintiffs filed for summary  damages under Rule 23(b)(3) is inappropriate for strip and \njudgment against the defendant, which this court granted  search  cases  because  of  the  individualized  damages. \non  August  19,  1998.1  Now  the  defendant  has  filed  a  (Dft’s  Motion,  p.  3).  Second,  the  class  should  be \nmotion to decertify the plaintiff class as to damages.  decertified because the plaintiffs do not have actual proof \n   of injury for each member of the class. (Dft’s Motion, p. \n  1 \n \n\nGary v. Sheahan, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (1999)   \n \n9). Finally, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief under  dated  August  18,  1998,  p.  3).  The  plaintiffs  present \n23(b)(2), so only nominal damages can be awarded. (Dft’s  evidence that plaintiffs suffered similar injuries from the \nMotion, p. 12). Each of these arguments will be addressed  searches  as  well,  seen  in  the  study  conducted  by \nin turn.  psychologist Dr. Joan Leska. (Pl’s Resp., p. 3; Pl’s Ex. \n   A).  While  the  study  only  demonstrated  trends  in \n  responses among various plaintiffs, the responses show a \nsimilarity in the type and severity of injury as a result of \nA. Individualized Damages  the trauma caused by the searches. (Pl’s Ex. A).2 The \nThe defendant argues that 23(b)(3) class certification for  Seventh Circuit has found that it is common for Rule \ndamages in an inmate case is inappropriate because of the  23(b)(3) class actions to involve differing levels of injury \nparticularized and fact-specific inquiries. (Dft’s Motion,  and damages for different class members; however, that \np. 4). The defendant relies strongly on Klein v. DuPage  does  not  mean  that  certifying  the  class  under  Rule \nCounty, a Northern District of Illinois case where the  23(b)(3) is incorrect. De La Fuente v. Stokely–Van Camp, \ndistrict  court  found  that  23(b)(3)  class  treatment  for  Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 233 (7th Cir.1983), citing Wright & \ndamages in an inmate strip search case was inappropriate.  Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1784 \n119  F.R.D.  29  (N.D.Ill.1988)  (J.  Moran).  The  court  (1972). \npointed to several factors that differentiated the damages    \nbetween plaintiffs, such as whether plaintiffs were forced \n2  The defendant argues that plaintiffs “sidestep” the issue \nthrough more than one search; whether plaintiffs were \n  of individualized damages by citing this study, for the \nviewed by members of the opposite sex; whether searches \nstudy only takes a sample of the 12,000 class members \nwere  manual  or  visual.  Id.  at  31.  To  support  their  and  thus  does  not  represent  an  analysis  of  typical \nreasoning,  the  court  also  recognized  that  the  jail  had  claims among typical class members. (Dft’s Reply, pp. \n“special institutional safety concerns” for “each plaintiff  9–10).  While  the  plaintiffs’  study  may  have  some \nmay have been arrested for different reasons, may have  selection bias in that survey responses were voluntary, \nhad full or no contact with those outside the prison, may  the randomly selected sample of over one percent of the \nclass should be enough to correct for bias and find a \npose little or great threats to prison safety, and may have \nstatistically significant response. \nbeen search in a variety of ways at numerous different \n \ntimes...” Id., at 31. \n    \nIn  response,  the  plaintiffs  cite  Eddleman  v.

WOOD, and EVANS, Circuit Judges.\nRehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied October 7, 1999.\nEASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge.\nAs in Blair v. Equifax Check Services, Inc., 181 F.3d 832 (7th Cir.1999), we have been asked to approve an\ninterlocutory appeal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f). See also 28 U.S.C. § 1292(e); Fed. R. App. P. 5. And as in Blair,\nthere is a preliminary question about appellate jurisdiction. Rule 23(f) authorizes us to \"permit an appeal from an\norder of a district court granting or denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it\nwithin ten days after entry of the order.\" Blair held an appeal may be filed either from the order itself or from the\ndisposition of a request for reconsideration filed within the time for appeal. Now we drop the other shoe: if the\nrequest for reconsideration is filed more than ten days after the order \"granting or denying class action\ncertification under this rule\", then appeal must wait until the final judgment.\nThis case was certified as a class action on April 10, 1997. In August 1998 defendant asked the district court to\n893 decertify the class. Defendant's motion was *893 denied on March 31, 1999, and a petition for leave to appeal\nwas filed within ten days of that order. (Ten rule days, not ten calendar days; under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) weekends\nand holidays do not count when a time limit prescribed by the civil rules is ten days or fewer.) Blair shows that a\nmotion to reconsider filed more than ten days after the order is too late to preserve the possibility of appeal under\nRule 23(f), and we do not think that it matters what caption the litigant places on the motion to reconsider. This\ncase demonstrates why that limit is essential. Otherwise, by styling a motion to reconsider as a motion to\ndecertify the class, a litigant could defeat the function of the ten-day line drawn in Rule 23(f).\nInterlocutory appeals are rare, because they may disrupt progress of the case. Because the decision whether a\nsuit will proceed as a class action is so vital, and sometimes so hard to review at the end of the case, Rule 23(f)\npermits the court of appeals to accelerate appellate review; but to ensure that there is only one window of\npotential disruption, and to permit the parties to proceed in confidence about the scope and stakes of the case\nthereafter, the window of review is deliberately small.\nBlair analogizes a motion for reconsideration to a post-judgment motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 or 59(e). That\nanalogy also supplies details about the effect of successive or belated motions in the district court. A motion filed\nafter the time allowed by these rules does not extend the time for appellate review. Browder v. Director,\nDepartment of Corrections, 434 U.S. 257, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). A second or successive motion\nfor reconsideration is just a motion filed after ten days: it does not restart the clock for appellate review. Charles v.\n\nDaley, 799 F.2d 343, 347-48 (7th Cir.1986). Cf. Midland Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, 149 F.3d 558, 563-64 (7th\nCir. 1998) (same rule for judicial review of administrative action).\nTo this rule there is a solitary exception, which we fancy would apply to Rule 23(f) as well: if in response to a\nbelated motion for reconsideration the judge materially alters the decision, then the party aggrieved by the\nalteration may appeal within the normal time. FTC v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Co., 344 U.S. 206, 211, 73 S.Ct.\n245, 97 L.Ed. 245 (1952); Charles, 799 F.2d at 348. Thus, had the district judge granted defendant's motion and\ndecertified the class, plaintiffs would have had ten days under Rule 23(f) to seek permission to appeal. Instead,\nhowever, the judge denied the motion and left the class definition in place. Accepting an appeal from such a\ndecision would abandon the time limit for all practical purposes. That step would be both unauthorized and\nimprudent.\nThe petition for leave to appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

However, this potential security threat ENDOFDOCUMENT\ncould not be that overwhelming since the defendant\ndoesnotstripsearchreturningmaleinmatesonareg-\nular basis. In fact, the defendant admits to as much\nthrough defendant witness testimony that male in-\nmate returnees are not searched because of the large\nsize of the male inmate population. (Transcripts,\nMarch 13, 1997, pp. 118-120, 150, 210-213). Also,\ndefendant witnesses admitted that it is not necessary\nfor plaintiff class members to return to the living\nquarters in the Division, and thus the security risk\nwould be eliminated if the personal belongings of\ndischarged female inmate returnees were brought to\nthem in the holding cell. (Mem. Op. and Order, Au-\ngust20,1998,p.14).\nIn contrast, the plaintiffs throughout this case have\npresented evidence that female inmate returnees are\nregularlystripsearchedwhentheyarereturnedtothe\nJailaftertheyhavebeenjudiciallydischarged.(Mem.\nOp.andOrder,August20,1998,pp.3-6).Femalein-\nmate returnees were even strip searched after the im-\nplementation of the preliminary injunction and\nwithouttheirconsent.(Mem.Op.andOrder,Septem-\nber 13, 1999, pp. 3-5). There is a significant public\ninterest in protecting the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights of the plaintiff class. Therefore,\nthe threatened harm to the plaintiff class of strip\nsearches continuing is significantly greater than the\nsecurity risk caused from informing female inmate\nreturnees that they will be strip searched if they re-\nturntotheDivisionlivingquarters.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant Michael\nSheahan, Sheriff of Cook County, in his official ca-\npacity, and his employees, are permanently enjoined\nfrom strip searching female inmate court returnees\nwho have been judicially discharged from the Cook\nCounty Department of Corrections.

BACKGROUND \n  \nThe  instant  action  involves  a  class  action  brought  by \nWhen presented with a claim of qualified immunity, a \nplaintiffs  Kenya  Gary  (“Gary”)  and  Tania  Hayes \ncourt  must  consider  two  questions:  (1)  whether  the \n(“Hayes”) (collectively, the “plaintiffs”) who represent a \nplaintiff  has  asserted  a  violation  of  the  constitutional \nclass of all female inmates who have been or will be \nright;  and,  (2)  whether  the  defendant’s  actions  were \nsubjected to a strip search at the Cook County Department \nobjectively reasonable in light of prevailing standards. See \nof Corrections (Jail) upon returning to the Jail from court \nSiegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232, 111 S.Ct. 1789, \nafter there is a judicial determination that there is no \n1793, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991); Donovan, 17 F.3d at 947. \nlonger  a  basis  for  their  detention,  other  than  to  be \n“A negative answer to either of these questions requires a \nprocessed for release.1 As the factual allegations in this \ndetermination that the officer is immune from a suit for \ncase  were  reviewed  in  detail  in  this  court’s  earlier \ndamages.” Chan v.

However, in the second  *3 The defendant’s behavior has made it clear to this \nmotion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs presented  court that the defendant, and subsequently the Jail, must \nevidence  of  blatant  violations  of  the  preliminary  have the orders of this court clearly spelled out or they \ninjunction  order.  For  example,  the  plaintiffs  presented  will continue these unconstitutional searches. This court \nevidence of female returnees who did not want to return  has already ruled that the defendant’s municipal policy of \nto the Division being told that they must sign a form in  routinely strip searching female inmates and not male \norder to be released. That form was a consent to a strip  inmates violated the plaintiff class’ Fourth and Fourteenth \nsearch. (Mem. Op. and Order, September 13, 1999, pp.  Amendment rights.

See, e.g., Elrod v. \nof this court’s preliminary injunction order.  Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 96 S .Ct. 2673 (1976). \n     \n   \n3. Balance of Harms and the Public Interest \nAnalysis  The defendant has argued throughout this case that the \npotential security threat of not strip searching inmates \nA court must consider four traditional criteria in deciding  when they return to the Jail outweighs any harm caused to \nwhether to grant a permanent injunction: 1) whether the  the individual plaintiffs by the search. (See, e.g., Dft’s \nplaintiffs have prevailed on the merits of its claim; 2)  Motion for Reconsideration of Prel. Inj., p. 10). However, \nwhether there is no adequate remedy under law or the  this  potential  security  threat  could  not  be  that \nplaintiffs will be irreparably harmed if the injunction is  overwhelming since the defendant does not strip search \nnot  issued;  3)  whether  the  threatened  injury  to  the  returning male inmates on a regular basis. In fact, the \nplaintiffs outweighs the threatened harm the injunction  defendant admits to as much through defendant witness \nmay inflict on the defendant; and 4) whether the issuance  testimony that male inmate returnees are not searched \nof the injunction will harm the public interest. Plummer v.  because of the large size of the male inmate population. \nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants,  97  (Transcripts,  March  13,  1997,  pp.  118–120,  150, \nF.3d 220, 229 (7th Cir.1996) (citing Amoco v. Village of  210–213). Also, defendant witnesses admitted that it is \nGambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546, n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 1404,  not necessary for plaintiff class members to return to the \nn. 12 (1987)).

Sheriff of- Cook County, No. 96 C 7294.  The lawsuit charges that during \nthe period from November 6, 1994 through October 17, 1997 the defendant, while operating the \nJail, had a practice and policy of strip searching all women upon their return to the Jail from \ncourt after there was a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention, \nother that to be processed for release.  The suit seeks an award of money damages, injunctive \nrelief and attorneys' fees and costs from the defendant.  The Court ruled that this case was to be \nmaintained as a class action on April 10, 1997.  If you were a potential class member you should \nhave received a notice in 1997 or 1998 advising you of the certification of this class and a notice \nEXHIBITB \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 555     Filed 07/18/2001     Page 6 of 9(cid:10)\ndated September 1, 2000 advising you of the Court's finding that tM Jail's strip search practice \nwas unconstitutional and procedures for filing a claim post card to be eligible to receive \ncompensation. \nThe purpose of this notice is to advise you of the status of the lawsuit, including a \nstatement of your rights with respect to a proposed settlement of the case. \nSIGNIFICANT RUlING BY THE COURT \nOn March 17, 1997 a preliminary injunction was issued by Judge David H. Coar \nenjoining the defendant and his employees from strip searching members of the class.  On \nAugust 19, 1998 Judge Coar granted summary judgment on the issue of liability to all class \nmembers strip searched between November 6,1994 and March 17, 1997.  Specifically, the Court \nfound that the defendant violated the plaintiffs' Equal Protection rights because the defendant \nhad a practice, which required the routine strip searching of women while men were not \nroutinely subjected to such a search upon returning to the Jail after a court appearance.  The \nCourt also found that the defendant violated the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights because the \nstrip search practice was an unreasonable invasion of the privacy interest of the plaintiffs.  On \nSeptember 13, 1999, the Court granted a second motion for summary judgment filed by the \nplaintiffs on the same Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment grounds for those class members strip \nsearched during the period between March 17, 1997, when the preliminary injunction went into \neffect, and October 17,1997. Finally, on November 1,1999, Judge Coar entered a permanent \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 555     Filed 07/18/2001     Page 7 of 9(cid:10)\ninjunction baning the strip searching of female inmate court returnees who have been judicially \ndischarged from the Jail. \nAs a result of the above stated ruling, the Court has found that the defendant is liable to \nthose members of the class who can prove that they were injured emotionally orphysically by \nthe strip search which occurred after they were returned to the Jail from the court following a \njudicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention, other than to be \nprocessed for release.  In order to be eligible to share in any award of monetary damages or \nsettlement, a proof of claim must have been returned by June 1,2001. \nTerms of Proposed Settlement \nSubject to court approval, the plaintiffs and the defendant have agreed on a settlement of \nthis case under which the defendant will create a settlement fund in the amount of $6,882,500, \nexclusive of attorneys' fees and costs.  The Settlement Funds shall be paid to class members with \napproved claims pursuant to the following formula: \n1.  The $6,882,500 Settlement Fund will be distributed equally among the eligible \nclass members after distributions to the named two class representatives and the four claimants \nwho were subjected to extensive psychiatric and psychological examinations by the defendant. \nThese women are entitled to additional compensation due to the fact that they each contributed \nsubstantial time, effort and expense toward the prosecution of the case for the class. \n2.  Named class representatives Kenya Gary and Tanya Hayes shall each receive \ncompensation of $25,000 and Mildred Claudio, Glenda Clayton, Elsie Bergens and Gina Goines \nshall each receive compensation of $25,000. \n3.  In order to share in this settlement, members of the class must have submitted a \nproperly completed claim form by June 1,2001. \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 555     Filed 07/18/2001     Page 8 of 9(cid:10)\n4.  The reasonable attorneys fees and costs of Class Counsel, as determined \nby the Court, will be paid, in addition to the amount contributed to the settletnent fund. \nThe defendant does not admit any wrongdoing or liability on his part.  The proposed \nsettlement with the defendant is a compromise of a disputed claim.  If approved, the settlement will \ndischarge the defendant from liability to the class members for the conduct alleged in the complaint. \nSettlement Hearing \nThe Court will hold a hearing in Courtroom 1419, United States Courthouse, 219 S. \nDearborn, Chicago, Illinois at on September 18, 2001, at 9:30 a.m. to determine whether, as \nrecommended by both Class Counsel and the Class Representatives, it should approve the proposed \nsettlement.  Objections to the proposed settlement by class members (who have not previously \nelected to exclude themselves from the class) will be considered by the court, but only if such \nobjections are filed in writing with the clerk by mail postmarked before  September 10, 2001. \nAttendance at the hearing is not necessary, however, class members wishing to be heard orally in \nopposition to the proposed settlement should indicate in their written objections their intention to \nappear at the hearing.  Class members who support the proposed settlement and the related matters \ndescribed in this Notice, do not need to appear at the hearing. \nThis Notice represents a summary of the settlement and related matter.  For further \ninformation, you may inspect the documents and records filed in this action during the regular office \nhours at the Office of the Clerk, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 219 \nS.

COAR \nMichael Sheahan, Sheriff of Cook County,  ) \nin his official capacity, \n) \nDefendant.  ) \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nBefore this court is plaintiffs' counsel Thomas G. Morrissey's (\"Morrissey\") and Robert \nH. Farley, Jr.'s (\"Farley\"), petition for interim attorney's fees and non-taxable expenses, dated \nFebruary 2, 2001.  For the following reasons, plaintiffs' counsel is awarded  $183,372.43  III \ninterim fees and $64,462.97 in interim costs. \nDiscussion \nThe plaintiffs' attorney submit that since their last interim fee petition, in December \n1999, they have incurred $64,462.97 in costs and $366,744.85 in fees.  In the fee petition \ncurrently before this court, plaintiffs' counsel is seeking fifty percent of the accrued attorney's \nfees ($183,372.43) and their costs, pending the resolution of the damages claims of the class \nmembers. \nIn determining the amount of attorney's fees and costs to award to the counsel for the \nprevailing party, the burden is on the party seeking the award to substantiate the hours worked \nand the rate claimed.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct 1933, 1939 (1983).  The \n~\\ \n\n____________________________,  ______w _  __  \nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 561     Filed 09/26/2001     Page 3 of 5(cid:10)\ndistrict court must review the fee request and has the discretion to increase or decrease the \namount in light of twelve factors.  Id. at 429-30 n.3, 103 S.Ct. at 1937-38 n.3.  The court must \nI \ngive a \"concise, but clear explanation\" for each modification to the proposed amount.  Smith v. \nGreat American Restaurants, Inc., 969 F.2d 430, 439 (7th Cir. 1992).  In analyzing the fee \nrequest, \"the most critical factor is the degree of success obtained.\" Estate of Borst v. O'Brien, \n979 F.2d 511,515 (7th Cir. 1992) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. at 1941). \nL  Hourly Rate Attorneys \nIn determining the rate to award the plaintiffs' counsel, the court must look at \"the rates \ncharged by lawyers in the community of 'reasonably comparable skill, experience and \nreputation.'\"  People Who Care v. Rockford Board of Education, 90 F.3d 1307, 1310 (7th Cir. \n1996).  The Seventh Circuit uses two methods to calculate fee awards: first is to use the current \nmarket rate; second is to base the award on the rate the attorney charged at the time services were \nrendered and then add interest.  Smith v. Village ofMaywooQ, 17 F.3d 219, 221 (7th Cir. 1994). \nMorrissey presents evidence that the current market rate for his work was within the \nrange of $265 to $295 per hour, and Farley presents evidence that the current market rate for his \nwork was within the range of$250 to $275.  (Affidavit of Thomas Peters; Affidavit of John \nStainthrop).  that he has been recently awarded $335 per hour in a similar case.  The defendant \nobjects to the increase in plaintiffs' attorneys hourly rates but does not provide any evidence to \nThese factors include: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of \nI \nthe questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; 4) the preclusion of \nemployment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the \nfee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the \namount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the \nattorneys; (10) the \"undesirability\" ofthe case; (11) the nature and length of the professional \nrelationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.  Johnson v. Georgia Highway \nExpress, Inc., 488 F.2d 714,717-19 (5th Cir. 1974). \n\n-----------_ \n_-,-----------\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     .D. ocument 561     Filed 09/26/2001     Page 4 of 5(cid:10)\n---~-----:-----:-------:-~\"'\" \nsupport such a rebuttal. Consequently, the rates proposed by plaintiffs' attorneys are considered \nreasonable,  People Who Care v. Rockford Board of Education, 90 F.3d 1307,1314-15 (7'h Cir. \n1992). \n2.  Hourly Rates of Paralegals \nAs the defendant has failed to provide this court or class counsel with any evidence \nsuggesting that the rates charged by plaintiff class' paralegal is unreasonable, the rates \ndetermined by the plaintiffs' counsel are appropriate and reasonable. \n3.  Compensation for Two Attorneys \nThe Seventh Circuit has determined that a court's award of attorneys' fees for more than \none attorney's time at court appearances is \"eminently reasonable and well within its discretion.\" \nUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Mutual Trading Com., 63 F.3d 516,520,525 (71h Cir. 1995). \nGiven the complex issues presented in these lawsuits, the presence of two attorneys was \nmore than reasonable.  Moreover, the defendant often had several lawyers present on his behalf \nand the plaintiff class was entitled to same advantage. \n4.  Court Appearances Where Plaintiffs' Motion Were Denied \nIn Hensley v. Echerhan, 461 U.S. 424, 435 (1983), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \nwhen a plaintiff has achieved excellent results, \"the fee should not be reduced simply because the \nplaintiff has failed to prevail on every contention in the lawsuit.\" In addition, the case law in the \nSeventh Circuit reflects that a fee award should not be reduced merely because a plaintiff lost \ncertain motions or rulings.  People Who Care v. Rockford Board of Education, 90 F.3d \nI \n1307,1314(7'h Cir. 1992); Kurowski v. Krajewski, 848 F.2d 767, 776 (7'h Cir.), cert.denied, 488 \nU.S, 926 (1988). \nConsequently, this court deems it reasonable to compensate plaintiffs' attorneys for the \n\n_--,----------------------\n------Ca-se -1:9-6-c-v-0-729_4    .  .D  ocument 561     Filed 09/26/2001     Page 5 of 5(cid:10)\n35.5 hours of time sought for court appearances (including travel) that may not have been at the \ntime successful. \nS.  Costs \nClass counsel has provided sufficient evidence to prove that its interim costs do, in fact, \ncome to a total sum of $64,462.97.  The defendant attempts to nonsensically assert that class \ncounsel's request for phone charges and postal expenses should not be granted because such \ncharges are \"within the normal operating overhead of any type of business or law practice.\" \nIn this court's experience, law practices always charge for phone calls and postage.  As the \ndefendant as has not provided any factual evidence as to why plaintiffs' counsel should be an \nexception, this court finds that class counsel's request for $64,462.97 in costs is reasonable. \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, class counsel is awarded  $183,372.43  in interim fees and \n$64,462.97 in interim costs. \nEnter: \n=U~J{kw \nDavid H.

COAR \nMICHAEL SHEAHAN, SHERIFF OF  ) \nCOOK COUNTY, in his official capacity,  ) \n) \nDefendant.  ) \nJUN 262., \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nBefore this court is plaintiffs Kenya Gary and Tania Hayes', through their attorneys Thomas \nG. Morrissey, Ltd., and Robert H. Farley, Ltd. (\"plaintiffs\"), petition for interim attorneys' fees and \ncosts dated December 20,  1999 [Doc. 475].  For the following reasons, plaintiffs' petition is \nGRANTED. \nBackground \nThis petition for interim fees and cost related to activities that occurred between October 5, \n1998 through September 24, 1999. This court previously awarded a portion of the interim fees and \ncosts due the plaintiffs for activities occurring around the preliminary injunction and the summary \njudgment ruling.  That order, issued in September of 1999, granted the plaintiffs $423,973.16 is \nattorneys'  fees  and $74,982.69 in costs.  The present petition addresses activities around the \nsummary judgment ruling on September 13, 1999 for plaintiffs Gina G., Glenda C., Mildred C., and \nother class members who were strip searched during the period of March 17, 1997 to October 17, \n1 \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 490     Filed 06/23/2000     Page 3 of 6(cid:10)\n1997 (\"S ummary Judgment II\"); the preparation for the plaintiffs' successful defense in the Seventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals of the Michael Sheahan's (\"Sheahan\") attempt to overrule this court's \ndenial of his motion to decertify the class; the litigation and appeal of the issue of interim fees; as \nwell as some work related to the damage claims. \nThe plaintiffs present a total fee amount of$517,129.20. However, the plaintiffs request an \naward of only fifty percent (50%) of attorneys' fees and their costs, pending the resolution of the \ndamages claims of the class members, for a total of$258,564.60 in fees and $26,412.05 in costs. \n(PI's Petition, p. 2).  The plaintiffs state that on November 15,1999, in accordance with Local Rule \n47, the attorneys for Sheahan were provided with the time and expenses records on which this \ninterim fee and costs petition was based. Local Rule 47C(5)(d ) requires a respondent within 21 days \nof receipt of the documents supporting the petition to provide opposing counsel with \"any evidence \nthe respondent will use to oppose the requested hours, rates, or related nontaxable expenses.\" \nSheahan's attorneys did not put forth any such evidence. \nAnalysis \nThe defendant makes three main arguments against the plaintiffs' request for interim fees: \n(1) the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties in that they have not obtained substantial relief on the \nmerits which is not defeasible by further proceedings; (2) the plaintiffs' interim fee request is \nexcessive; (3) the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) limits the recovery of fees in this action. \nAs to the defendant's argument that plaintiffs have not obtained substantial relief, this court \naddressed this issue in the opinion on the previous petition for interim fees and it does not need to \nbe addressed again.  See Memorandum Opinion and Order, August 25, 1999, pp. 3-5. \nAs to the defendant's argument that the plaintiffs' interim fee request is excessive, the \n2 \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 490     Filed 06/23/2000     Page 4 of 6(cid:10)\ndefendant cites Hensley v. Eckerhart for the argument that if a § 1983 plaintiff has achieved only \npartial or limited success, then the requested fees may be out ofp roportion to the success ofthe case. \n461 U.S. 424, 436 , 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941.  However, in Hensley the plaintiffs did not succeed on \nall its claims on the merits, and thus were partially prevailing parties. In contrast, in the present case \nthe plaintiffs have prevailed on all claims on the merits. Liability has been determined and only the \nlevel of damages is left to be litigated.  Unlike partially prevailing parties, where plaintiffs have \n\"tactical victories in what turned out to be a losing war,\" the plaintiffs in the present case have won \nall the significant battles.  Petrovich v. Consolidated High School District #230,959 F.Supp. 884, \n890-91, citing Hunger v. Leininger, 15 F.3d 664, 670 (7th Cir. 1994). \nThe defendant has made no specific objections to any of the time entries and instead has \nmade the general objection that \"the time records relate primarily to the damage claims ...\"  (Dft's \nResp., p. 8).  Not only has the defendant failed to state his objections with clarity and particularity, \nHutchinson v. Amateur Electronic Supply. Inc., 42 F.3d 1037, 1048 (7th Cir. 1994), but he also fails \nto recognize that the majority of the fees requested are for the Summary Judgment II as well as for \nthe successful defense of a Seventh Circuit appeal and the litigation and appeal of the issue of \ninterim fees. \nThe defendant's final argument is that the PLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq., applies to this \ncase and thus attorneys' fees are limited to $97.50 per hour for all reasonable time spent in court and \n$67.50 for all reasonable time spent on out of court matters.  (Dft's Resp., pp. 10-12, citing PLRA, \n42 U.S.c. § 1997e(d)(2».  To support his argument, the defendant cites the Seventh Circuit case \nKerr v. Puckett, 138 F.3d 321, 323 (7th Cir. 1998).  However, the Seventh Circuit held just the \nopposite in Kerr, for the court made it clear that the PLRA is only applicable to a \"prisoner\" and not \n3 \n\nCase 1:96-cv-07294     Document 490     Filed 06/23/2000     Page 5 of 6(cid:10)\nan \"ex-prisoner.\"  In particular, the court specifically stated that a plaintiff who waits to bring her \ncase until after her release avoids the application of the PLRA.  Kerr, 138 F.3d at 323.
