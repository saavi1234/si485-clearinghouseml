    "summary": "<p>On April 21, 2005, a woman represented by private attorneys from several Philadelphia, New York, and D.C. law firms filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  She alleged that the City of Philadelphia of had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all pre-trial detainees remanded to the custody of the Philadelphia Prison System, regardless of criminal charge or reasonable suspicion.  Plaintiff alleged that the policy required all arrestees to disrobe in front of a corrections officer, who then conducted visual inspection of the genitals and body cavities, using a flashlight to illuminate body cavities.  Plaintiff claimed the practice violated the Fourth Amendment and sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages,  attorneys' fees, and class certification for the thousands who allegedly suffered the same indignities.  The City of Philadelphia, the prison system, and officials responsible for that system, as defendants, answered by generally denying the allegations.</p><p>Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment.  By order dated June 9, 2006, the District Court (Judge Mary A. McLaughlin) denied the motions, advising the parties that the motions could be refiled after resolution of the issue of class certification.</p><p>Plaintiff moved for class certification on February 16, 2007, and for a preliminary injunction on March 23, 2007.  Both motions were still pending at the time of this summary.  Between the motion filings, on February 23, 2007, plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding a male plaintiff and naming only the City of Philadelphia as the defendant.  Discovery proceedings continued and, on July 3, 2007, Judge McLaughlin's unpublished order directed that the matter was set for a settlement conference on July 24, 2007, before Magistrate Judge Elizabeth T. Hey.</p><p>On February 20, 2009, the parties entered into a $5.9 million settlement.  The agreement established the following two settlement classes:</p><p>Subclass I:</p><p>All persons in the Settlement Class, EXCEPT for persons who (1) were charged with certain violence, drug and/or weapons (hereinafter \"VDW\") related misdemeanor charges at the time of their admission, or (2) were charged with bench warrants and/or probation violations where the underlying charge was a VDW misdemeanor charge, or (3) had convictions for felonies and/or VDW misdemeanor charges predating the date of their admission.</p><p>Subclass II:</p><p>All persons in the Settlement Class who were (1) charged with VDW misdemeanor charges at the time of their admission, or (2) were charged with bench warrants and/or probation violations where the underlying charge was a VDW misdemeanor charge, or (3) had convictions for felonies and/or VDW misdemeanor charges predating the date of their admission.</p><p>On November 3, 2009, the court entered a Memorandum and Opinion and a separate Memorandum and Order, granting final approval of the proposed settlement.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nNAKISHA BOONE, et al. :      CIVIL ACTION\n:\n  v. :\n:\nCITY OF PHILADELPHIA :       No. 05-1851\nMEMORANDUM\nMcLaughlin, J. November 3, 2009\nThe parties have moved for the certification of a class\nand approval of a settlement in this case involving the policy of\nthe City of Philadelphia to strip-search all pretrial detainees\nupon admission to the Philadelphia Prison System (PPS).  Class\ncounsel has also moved for an award of attorneysโ fees and\nreimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.  After a hearing held on\nSeptember 29, 2009, the Court grants these motions and enters\nfinal judgment and an order of dismissal. \nI. Background \nA. History of the Litigation\nClass representative Nakisha Boone brought this class\naction on behalf of herself and all others who were strip-\nsearched after being charged with a misdemeanor or other minor\ncrime.  Ms. Boone was arrested for violating a bench warrant with\nan underlying charge of endangering the welfare of a child.  She\n\nwas strip-searched before being placed into detention.  She\nargued that PPSโs policy of strip-searching all pretrial\ndetainees upon admission was unconstitutional.  The complaint\nnamed the City, the PPS, the Prisons Commissioner, members of the\nPrisonsโ Board of Trustees and three of the prisonโs Deputy\nCommissioners as defendants. \nThe class was defined in the complaint as\n[a]ll persons who have been or will be placed\ninto the custody of the PPS after being\ncharged with misdemeanor violations,\nviolations of probation or parole, traffic\ninfractions, civil commitments or other minor\ncrimes and were or will be strip searched\nupon entry into PPS pursuant to the policy,\ncustom and practice of the PPS and the City\nof Philadelphia.\nCompl. at 7.  The class period commenced on April 21, 2003, and\nwas to extend until the defendants were enjoined from or\notherwise ceased enforcing the policy.  Id.\nThe parties engaged in extensive discovery from July\n2005 until November 2005.  This initial period of discovery\nfocused on the PPSโs policy.  It included the production of\ndocuments relating to the prison policies, an inspection of the\nPPS facility, and depositions of prison officials and staff.\nThe plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary\njudgment on the issue of the constitutionality of the defendantsโ\nblanket strip-search policy on January 23, 2006.  The defendants\nresponded to the plaintiffโs motion a month later and filed their\n2\n\nown motion for summary judgment, to which the plaintiff\nresponded. \nIn their motion, the defendants argued in part that the\nsearch policy was justified by the PPSโs need for security and\nsafety.  They maintained that the policy was necessary to prevent\ndetainees from smuggling contraband into the prison system.  See\nDef. Mot. for Summary Judgment at 21-23.  They also argued that\nthe search of Ms. Boone was reasonable due to her prior history\nof criminal charges, which included a conviction for simple\nassault, possession of an instrument of crime, recklessly\nendangering another person, and criminal conspiracy.  See id. at\n32; Partiesโ Motion for Class Cert. and Settlement at 4-5. \nOral argument on the partiesโ summary judgment motions\nwas held before the Court on April 27, 2006.  After the hearing,\nthe Court dismissed with prejudice the individually-named\ndefendants and the PPS from the case upon stipulation of the\nparties.  The City remained as the sole defendant.  The parties\nalso stipulated to a discovery and briefing schedule with respect\nto class certification.  The Court denied both partiesโ summary\njudgment motions without prejudice and held that the parties\nwould have the opportunity to renew their motions after the issue\nof class certification was resolved.  \nIn response to the Cityโs argument that the search of\nMs. Boone was reasonable based upon her criminal history, the\n3\n\nplaintiff amended the complaint to add class representative\nGeorge Byrd.  Mr. Byrd was charged with driving under the\ninfluence when admitted to the prison.  He had no previous\nhistory of violent crime.  See Mem. in Support of Plaintiffโs\nUnopposed Motion to Amend the Class Action Compl. at 2.\nThe parties conducted additional discovery on the issue\nof class certification for almost six months.  They interviewed\nhundreds of class members to establish that a substantial number\nof pretrial detainees would be within the class definition.  They\nalso reviewed hundreds of the prisonโs disciplinary records to\ndetermine how many misdemeanor detainees attempted to smuggle\ncontraband into the PPS facility.\nThe plaintiffs filed their motion for class\ncertification on February 16, 2007, and the defendants responded\non April 16, 2007.  The plaintiffs also filed a motion for\npreliminary injunction on March 23, 2007.  \nA hearing on both of the plaintiffsโ motions was held\non June 28, 2009.  At the hearing, the City informed the Court\nthat it was preparing procedures for the use of equipment that\nwould be used in lieu of strip-searching. \nIn view of the Cityโs proposed change in policy, the\nCourt referred the matter to Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Hey for\nsettlement.  Negotiations began in July of 2007.  The parties met\nwith Judge Hey eleven times over the course of the year.  These\n4\n\nnegotiations concluded with a mediation held on July 21, 2008,\nbefore retired Magistrate Judge James R. Melinson, in which\nsettlement was reached.  \nAfter reaching the settlement, the parties memorialized\nthe terms in a Settlement Agreement, prepared for the\nadministration of the settlement, and drafted the class notice. \nThey executed the proposed Settlement Agreement on February 20,\n2009.\nB. The Settlement Agreement\nThe Settlement Agreement divides the Settlement Class\ninto two subclasses, defined as follows: \nAll persons who were placed into the custody\nof the Philadelphia Prison System after being\ncharged with misdemeanors; summary offenses;\ntraffic infractions, civil commitments, or\nother minor crimes; or bench warrants and/or\nprobation violations where the underlying\ncharge was a misdemeanor, summary offense or\nother minor crime; and who were strip-\nsearched in the absence of reasonable\nsuspicion upon their entry into the\nPhiladelphia Prison System pursuant to the\npolicy, custom and practice of the\nPhiladelphia Prison System and the City of\nPhiladelphia.  The class period commences on\nApril 21, 2003 and extends to, and includes,\nOctober 9, 2007.    \nSubclass I: \nAll persons in the Settlement Class, EXCEPT\nfor persons who (1) were charged with certain\nviolence, drug and/or weapons (hereinafter\n\"VDW\") related misdemeanor charges at the\ntime of their admission, or (2) were charged\n5\n\nwith bench warrants and/or probation\nviolations where the underlying charge was a\nVDW misdemeanor charge, or (3) had\nconvictions for felonies and/or VDW\nmisdemeanor charges predating the date of\ntheir admission.\nSubclass II: \nAll persons in the Settlement Class who were\n(1) charged with VDW misdemeanor charges at\nthe time of their admission, or (2) were\ncharged with bench warrants and/or probation\nviolations where the underlying charge was a\nVDW misdemeanor charge, or (3) had\nconvictions for felonies and/or VDW\nmisdemeanor charges predating the date of\ntheir admission.\nSettlement Agreement at 7.\nThe Settlement Agreement recognized that the City had\nchanged its policy to stop strip-searching all pretrial detainees\non a blanket basis and to stop strip-searching misdemeanor\ndetainees in the absence of reasonable suspicion.  See id. at 10. \nThe City adopted a model policy that uses modern technology such\nas metal-detecting chairs and ion scanners to thoroughly search\nall pretrial detainees without a strip-search.  See Partiesโ Mot.\nfor Class Cert. and Settlement at 3.   \nThe Settlement Agreement states that the Cityโs current\nwritten policy has been reviewed by the City of Philadelphia Law\nDepartment for compliance with state and federal law.  The City\nmaintains that the current policy is constitutional.  The\nSettlement Agreement requires that all correction officers have\naccess to the policy.  Current and new corrections officers have\n6\n\nbeen, and will continue to be, trained on the policy.  The\nSettlement Agreement also states that the policy will be posted\nin the intake area of the PPS.  See Settlement Agreement at 10-\n11.\nThe Settlement Agreement creates a fund to compensate\nthe class members in the amount of $5,900,000.  See id. at 8. \nAll administrative expenses, including the costs of settlement\nadministration, website maintenance, notice to class members and\nattorneys' fees, costs and incentive awards will be deducted from\nthe settlement fund prior to determining the amount of\ndistribution.  See id. at 11-12.  An amount of the fund, not to\nexceed $330,000, was to be dedicated to the settlement\nadministrator to cover the costs of notice and administration. \nSee id. at 11.  \nClass counsel agreed that they would not seek more than\n30% of the entire Settlement Fund in attorneysโ fees.  See id. at\n14.  The Settlement Agreement also states that an award of\n$15,000 will be requested for each of the class representatives.\nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the total amount\nof the fund dedicated to members of Subclass I is $5,170,000, to\nbe granted pro rata to each class member who submits a timely\nclaim form, in an amount not to exceed $3,000 per class member. \nThe amount dedicated for Subclass II is $400,000, with a cap of\n$100 per claimant.  See id. at 12.  If the final approval of the\n7\n\nsettlement is appealed and some portion of the Settlement Fund is\nnot subject to the dispute, the undisputed portion was to be\ndistributed in accordance with the Settlement Agreement.  See id.\nat 14.\nNotice was to be provided by the direct mailing of\nclass notice and a claim form to all identifiable individuals in\nthe Settlement Class.  The Settlement Agreement also provides\nthat notice would be given by television advertisement.  The\nsettlement administrator was also instructed to establish a\nwebsite and maintain a toll-free number.  Copies of the class\nnotice and claim form were to be available by request over the\nphone, and downloadable copies of the documents would be\navailable at the website.  See id. at 15-16.\nThe Settlement Agreement provided the method for class\nmembers to submit requests for exclusion in writing.  It also\nprovided the process for objecting to the settlement, including\nthe reservation of the right to appeal final judgment of the\nsettlement.  See id. at 16-17.\nThe Settlement was preliminarily approved by this Court\non March 6, 2009. \n8\n\nC. Notice to the Class\nThe claims administrator attests that notice went out\nto 37,159 putative class members on May 1, 2009, by way of\nregular mail.  See Partiesโ Mot. for Class Cert. and Settlement,\nAffidavit of RSM McGladrey, Inc., Exhibit C.  All mail that was\nundeliverable because of inaccurate addresses was investigated\nusing a locator database to ascertain the correct address and\nthen re-mailed to the members of the class where possible.  \nThe administrator also contracted with a website\nadministrator to create a website that provided information to\nthe class in both English and Spanish.  The administrator also\nestablished a toll-free phone number and handled incoming\ntelephone calls and written correspondence from prospective class\nmembers.  See id.\nThe administrator provided further notice by way of\npublication in the Philadelphia Tribune, Philadelphia Al Dia and\nthe Philadelphia Daily News on May 4, 2009, and again in the\nPhiladelphia Daily News on August 17, 2009.  Finally, the\nadministrator provided notice through television during the weeks\nof April 27, 2009 and May 4, 2009.  See Partiesโ Mot. for Class\nCert. and Settlement at 1-2.\n \n9\n\nD. The Response of the Class\nThe claims administrator received 7,647 claims forms,\n5,321 of which represent claimants who appear in the Cityโs\nrecords, a claims rate of 15%.  See id. Exhibit C.1   Five members\nof the class opted out.  See Partiesโ Mot. for Class Cert. and\nSettlement at 2. \nThe parties report that the individual members of\nSubclass I will receive approximately $1,400.  Members of\nSubclass II will receive approximately $100.  See id. \nDue to the volume and response of the class, the\nadministrator spent an extra $211,220.00 above the original\n$330,000 earmarked for class administration costs.  The parties\nhave requested that the Court award an additional $100,000.00 to\nthe administrator, providing a total of $430,000 in\nadministrative costs.  See id. \nThree objectors submitted written objections to the\nproposed settlement.  Two of the objectors, Kuwsh Muhammad and\nThomas R. Mundy, object to issues concerning the second subclass. \nSee Objection of Kuwsh Muhammad; Objection of Thomas R. Mundy.\nMr. Muhammad is a member of Subclass II because he was arrested\non violent, drug or weapons-related charges.  He objects to the\ndifference in recovery amount between the two subclasses.  Mr.\n1The 2,326 other claims forms are currently marked as\nineligible because the individuals who submitted them do not\nappear in the Cityโs records.\n10\n\nMundy is a member of Subclass II because of a previous felony\nconviction.  He objects to his exclusion from Subclass I based\nupon this previous conviction.  \nThe third objector, Aole Blackman/Wright, objects to\nthe fees and costs that will be deducted from the fund.  See\nObjection of Aole Blackman/Wright.  None of the objectors\nappeared at the fairness hearing.\nE. Attorneyโs Fees, Expenses, and Class Representative \nAwards                                             \nClass counsel have requested 30% of the Settlement Fund\nfor attorneyโs fees, which amounts to a payment of $1,770,000.00.\nSee Pl.โs Joint Mot. for Fees and Expenses at 1.  Class counsel\nalso seeks reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses of\n$70,094.24.  See Declaration of Daniel C. Levin of October 2,\n2009.  Finally, class counsel requests a special award of $15,000\nfor the two named class representatives.  See Pl.โs Joint Mot.\nfor Fees and Expenses at 21-22.  \nII. Discussion\nThe Court decides the following four questions:\nA) whether the proposed class can be properly\ncertified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n23;\nB) whether notice to the class regarding the\nsettlement and attorneysโ fees petition was\nadequate;\n11\n\nC) whether the settlement itself is fair, reasonable\nand adequate; and\nD) whether class counselsโ petition for attorneysโ\nfees, out-of-pocket expenses and special awards to\nthe class representatives should be approved.\nAs preliminary matter, the Court will discuss the law\nrelating to the constitutionality of a strip-search policy like\nthe one at issue here.\nThe Supreme Court has held that a court must analyze a\nprisonโs strip-search policy under the Fourth Amendment.  See\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  In Bell, a federal short-\nterm custodial facility had a policy to strip-search all pre-\ntrial detainees after a contact visit with an outside visitor. \nThe Court found that, under the circumstances, the strip-searches\nconducted under the policy were not unreasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.  See id. at 559. \nIn determining the reasonableness of a prisonโs search\npolicy, the Bell Court held that courts must balance the prisonโs\nsignificant and legitimate interests in safety and security with\nthe privacy interests of the individuals.  See id. at 559-60.  It\npresented four factors for a court to consider in that balance:\n(1) the scope of the particular intrusion; (2) the manner in\nwhich it is conducted; (3) the justification for initiating it;\nand (4) the place in which it is conducted.  See id. at 559.\nThe Court in Bell found that the prisonโs policy was\nreasonable under this standard because the interest in preventing\n12\n\ncontraband from entering the prison facility outweighed the\nprivacy interests of the inmates searched.   The categorical\nreasonable suspicion that a prisoner might use contact with an\noutside visitor to smuggle contraband into the prison justified\nthe invasiveness of the policy.  See id. at 558.  \nBellโs holding was limited to the specific policy in\nquestion, and the Supreme Court left open the question of whether\nreasonable suspicion must be established to justify a policy to\nstrip-search all incoming inmates or pretrial detainees.  Since\nthat time, however, ten Circuit Courts of Appeal and several\ndistrict courts have addressed the issue.\nCourts in eight circuits have held that a policy to\nstrip-search all pre-trial detainees is unconstitutional under\nBell.2  These courts interpret Bell to require that a prison have\nreasonable suspicion that a particular arrestee is concealing\nweapons or other contraband before conducting a strip-search of\nthat arrestee.  Some of these courts have also concluded that\nBell allows such reasonable suspicion to be established\ncategorically for certain groups of prison detainees, such as\n2See Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir. 2001);\nWeber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 483\nU.S. 1020 (1987); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th\nCir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989); Jones v. Edwards,\n770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985); Stewart v. County of Lubbock, 767\nF.2d 153 (5th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1066 (1986);\nHill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir. 1984); Mary Beth G. v.\nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983); Logan v. Shealy,\n660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 942 (1982). \n13\n\nthose charged with felonies or violent or drug-related\nmisdemeanors.3\nOne circuit court, however, recently broke with the\nmajority and overruled its previous decisions on this issue.  See\nPowell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2009) (overruling\nWilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir. 2001)).  The court in\nPowell held that a blanket strip-search policy for all arrestees\ncan be constitutional under Bell.  It reasoned that the Bell\nbalancing test allows for the interest of prison security to\noutweigh the individual privacy interests of detainees,\nregardless of whether there is reasonable suspicion that the\nparticular arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband.  See id.\nat 1309-12.\nAnother circuit is reconsidering its line of cases on\nthe issue4 and rehearing a strip-search case en banc.  See Bull v.\nCity and County of San Francisco, 539 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2008),\nrehearing en banc granted, 558 F.3d 887 (9th Cir. 2009).  The\nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit has yet to rule on this\nissue.\n3See, e.g., Weber, 804 F.2d at 802; Masters, 872 F.2d at\n1255; Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272.\n4See Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th\nCir. 1989); Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702,\n711 (9th Cir. 1989), Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th\nCir.1984), overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la\nVina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc). \n14\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case, therefore, would have to\nestablish that the Cityโs policy was unconstitutional under the\nBell standard.  To do so, they must show that Bell requires a\nreasonable suspicion to conduct a strip-search of pre-trial\ndetainees.  They must then show that, under the Bell factors, the\npolicy was unreasonable as applied to all persons arrested for\nmisdemeanors and minor crimes, including those charged with\nviolence, drug, or weapons-related crimes and those with a\nprevious felony or violence, drug, or weapons-related misdemeanor\nconviction.\nA. Class Certification\nA court presented with a joint request for approval of\na class certification and settlement must separate its analysis\nof the class certification from its determination that the\nsettlement is fair.  See In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust\nLitigation, 2009 WL 2855855 at *9 (3d Cir. September 8, 2009). \nTo certify a class under Rule 23, a court must find that all four\nrequirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one part of Rule 23(b)\nare met.  See Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 55 (3d Cir. 1994). \nThe Settlement Class includes all individuals who were\nplaced into the custody of PPS after being charged with\nmisdemeanors or other minor crimes and were strip-searched upon\nentry.  The class period commences on April 21, 2003 and extends\nto, and includes, October 9, 2007.  The Settlement Class is then\n15\n\ndivided into two Subclasses.  Subclass I includes all persons in\nthe Settlement Class except those who (1) were arrested for\nviolence, drugs or weapons-related misdemeanor charges, (2) were\ncharged with bench warrants or probation violations where the\nunderlying charge was a violence, drugs or weapons-related\nmisdemeanor charge, or (3) had convictions for felonies or\nviolence, drugs or weapons-related misdemeanors.  Subclass II\nincludes all members of the Settlement Class excluded from\nSubclass I.\n1. Analysis Under Rule 23(a)\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 23(a) requires\nthat four requirements be met in order for a to be certified: \nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequate representation. \nSee Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997). \nThe Court finds that the four requirements of Rule 23(a) are met.\na. The Numerosity Requirement\nRule 23(a)(1) requires a class to be so numerous that\njoinder of all members is impracticable.  Classes exceeding forty\nor more class members are generally held to meet the numerosity\nrequirement.  See Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226-227 (3d\nCir. 2001).  The Settlement Class consists of over 37,000\nindividuals.  Currently, 5,400 of those individuals have\n16\n\nsubmitted verified claims forms.  Because joinder of such a large\nclass is impracticable, the plaintiffs satisfy the numerosity\nrequirement.\nb. The Commonality Requirement\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there are questions of law\nor fact common to the class.  If class members share at least one\nquestion of law or fact in common, factual differences among the\nclaims of the class members do not defeat certification.  In re\nPrudential Ins. Co. America Sales Practice Litigation Agent\nActions, 148 F.3d 283, 310 (3d Cir. 1998) (In re Prudential).  In\nthis case, there is a legal issue common to all class members: \nwhether the defendantโs blanket policy of strip-searching all\ndetainees upon admission was constitutional.  This satisfies the\nRule 23(a)(2) commonality requirement.\nc. The Typicality and Adequacy Requirements\nRule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) require that the claims or\ndefenses of the representative parties be typical of the claims\nor defenses of the class and that the representative parties will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  The\nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit has noted that these two\ninquiries tend to merge because both evaluate the relation of the\nclaims and the potential conflicts between the class\n17\n\nrepresentatives and the class in general.  Beck v. Maximus, Inc.,\n457 F.3d 291, 296 (3d Cir. 2006).  \nThe typicality inquiry centers on whether the interests\nof the class representatives align with the interests of the\nabsent class members such that the former is working towards the\nbenefit of the class as a whole.  See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d\nat 311.\nTwo distinct inquiries comprise the adequacy\nrequirement.  See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 312.  The first\ninquiry determines whether any significant antagonistic interests\nor conflicts exist between the class representatives and absent\nclass members.  The second inquiry looks to the experience and\nexpertise of class counsel in representing the class.  See id. \nIf a court finds that a single class representative\ncannot represent the entire class, it may under Rule 23(c)(5)\ndivide a class into subclasses where appropriate.  When class\nmembers have different claims or defenses or have conflicting or\nantagonistic interests, subclasses are appropriate.  Each\nsubclass is then to be treated as a class within the rule, and\neach must have its own representative.  See id. at 312; Amchem,\n521 U.S. at 627. \n In this case, the parties have separated the\nsettlement class into two subclasses:  Subclass I includes all\npersons in the Settlement Class except those who (1) were\n18\n\narrested for violence, drugs or weapons-related misdemeanor\ncharges, (2) were charged with bench warrants or probation\nviolations where the underlying charge was a violence, drugs or\nweapons-related misdemeanor charge, or (3) had convictions for\nfelonies or violence, drugs or weapons-related misdemeanors;\nSubclass II includes all members of the Settlement Class excluded\nfrom Subclass I.\nThe Court finds that the creation of subclasses is\nappropriate here because each of the two subclasses will have to\nmake a different showing to establish that the City lacked the\nreasonable suspicion to strip search the subclass members.  For\nthe members of Subclass I to prevail on their claims, they must\nestablish both that Bell requires a reasonable suspicion to\nconduct a strip search of all pre-trial detainees and that the\nCity lacked such a reasonable suspicion with regard to them. \nThe members of Subclass II, however, will have to make\nthe additional showing that the City could not strip-search them\ncategorically based upon the reasonable suspicion that they are\nmore likely to attempt to smuggle contraband into the prison due\nto the nature of the charges against them or their criminal\nhistory.  The members of Subclass II therefore would have to show\nthat reasonable suspicion to strip-search must be established\nindividually and cannot be found categorically.  \n19\n\nThe proposed division into these two subclasses is\nreflected in the decisions of other courts,5 in that courts\nroutinely certify classes with definitions excluding individuals\nviolence, drug, or weapons-related charges.6  \nThe class representatives in this case have claims\ntypical of, and no interests antagonistic to, members of their\nrespective subclasses.  Mr. Byrd who, represents Subclass I, was\ncharged with a non-violence, drug or weapons-related misdemeanor\nand had no previous criminal history.  Ms. Boone represents\nSubclass II.  Although she was arrested for a non-violence, drug\nor weapons-related crime, she had a criminal history involving\nviolent crimes.  \nFinally, class counsel in this case has substantial\nexperience in litigating complex civil rights actions.  They have\nserved as class counsel in at least twenty strip-search class\nactions.  Class counsel have also vigorously represented the\n5At least one other district court has created subclasses\nalong similar lines.  See Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F.Supp.2D\n131, 135 (D. Ma. 2001).\n6See, e.g., Miracle v. Bullitt County, Ky., 2008 WL 3850477\n(W.D. Ky. Aug. 15, 2008); Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders\nof County of Burlington, 2008 WL 800970, *6 (D.N.J. March 20,\n2008); Johnson v. District of Columbia, 248 F.R.D. 46, 50 (D.D.C.\n2008); Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 539 F.3d 1193,\n1195 (9th Cir. 2008); Sutton v. Hopkins County, 2007 WL 119892,\n*1 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, 2007); Tardiff v. Knox County, 218 F.R.D.\n332, 336 (D. Me. 2004); Nilsen v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19, 25\n(D. Me. 2003);  McBean v. City of New York, 228 F.R.D. 487, 490\n(S.D.N.Y. 2005); Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis., 219 F.R.D.\n607, 623 (W.D. Wis. 2003).\n20\n\nclass through four years of litigation, including discovery and\nmotion practice.  They fulfill the adequacy requirement of Rule\n23(a).\nFor these reasons, the Court finds that the four\nrequirements of Rule 23(a), numerosity, commonality, typicality\nand adequacy, are met in this case.\n    \n2. Analysis Under Rule 23(b)\nOnce a court determines that the requirements of Rule\n23(a) are met, it must consider whether the action is\nmaintainable under one of the three parts of Rule 23(b).  The\nparties seek to have this class certified under Rule 23(b)(3). \nRule 23(b)(3) allows certification only if the\nquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over\nany questions affecting only individual members and if a class\naction is superior to other available methods for fairly and\nefficiently adjudicating the controversy.  This is commonly\nbroken out into the so-called โpredominanceโ and โsuperiorityโ\nrequirements.  See In re: Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litigation,\n2009 WL 2855855 at *10.  \nRule 23(b)(3) also provides a non-exhaustive list of\nfactors to aid the court in determining whether a class action is\nthe best method of adjudication:  (1) the class members'\ninterests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense\n21\n\nof separate actions; (2) the extent and nature of any litigation\nconcerning the controversy already begun by or against class\nmembers; (3) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating\nthe litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (4) the\nlikely difficulties in managing a class action.  Although the\nfourth factor has been held to be not relevant in a settlement-\nonly class certification, the other requirements of the rule\nโdemand undiluted, even heightened, attention in the settlement\ncontext.โ  Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620. \na. The Predominance Requirement\nUnder Rule 23(b)(3), a court must determine that common\nquestions of law or fact predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members.  Predominance is found when common\nquestions represent a significant part of the case and can be\nresolved for all members of the class in a single adjudication. \nSee 7AA Charles A. Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure\nยง 1778 (3d ed. 2005).  To establish predominance, the plaintiffs\nmust show by a preponderance of the evidence that the elements of\ntheir claim can be proven by evidence common to all in their\nclass.  See In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d\n305, 311-12 (3d Cir. 2008).  \nFor the members of Subclass I, the question is whether\nthe Cityโs policy of strip-searching all pre-trial detainees in\n22\n\nthe absence of reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth\nAmendment.  General evidence of the policy and its blanket\napplication to the subclass members will be required to prove the\nsubclassโs claim.  Evidence of the circumstances of each\nindividual search would not be necessary to prove this claim. \nThis has led many courts to conclude that the common question of\nthe constitutionality of such a blanket strip-search policy as\napplied to members of classes similar to Subclass I meets the\npredominance requirement.7  \nMembers of Subclass II would need to prove that the\nCityโs policy was unconstitutional as applied to arrestees\ncharged with violence, drug or weapons-related crimes or\narrestees with a previous felony or violence, drug or weapons-\nrelated misdemeanor conviction.  The members of this subclass\nmust not only show that the Cityโs policy was unconstitutional as\napplied to all arrestees, but also that the City was\nconstitutionally required to establish reasonable suspicion for\neach individual arrestee before conducting a search.  This common\nquestion of whether individualized reasonable suspicion is\nconstitutionally required predominates over any individual\nquestions within this subclass. \n7See, e.g., Florence, 2008 WL 800970 at *12; Johnson, 248\nF.R.D. at 56-57 (D.D.C. 2008); Sutton, 2007 WL 119892, *6-*9;\nTardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 5-7 (1st Cir. 2004);\nBlihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 620-22; Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208\nF.R.D. 69, 76-77 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).\n23\n\nWithin each subclass, then, a common issue predominates\nover any individual claims, and the elements of each claim can be\nproven with evidence common to all.  The predominance requirement\nunder Rule 23(b)(3) is therefore satisfied.\nb. The Superiority Requirement\nUnder the superiority requirement, the court asks\nwhether a class action, rather than individual litigation, is the\nbest method for achieving a fair and efficient adjudication.  See\nNewton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d\n154 (3d Cir. 2001). \nA class action in this case saves the time, effort and\nexpense of litigating the claims of as many as 37,000 class\nmembers individually and guarantees uniform treatment of\nindividual class members within their respective subclasses.  The\nparties have not identified, and the Court is not aware of, any\nother strip-search litigation involving PPS or the City of\nPhiladelphia.  Because it is generally desirable to concentrate\nmany smaller claims into a single forum, a class action is\nappropriate in this case.  A class action is the superior method\nfor adjudicating this particular matter.  \nFinding that the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule\n23(b)(3) are met, the Court hereby certifies the class as\npresented by the parties.\n24\n\n    \nB. Notice\nUnder Rule 23(c)(2)(B), notice must be given to\npotential class members by the best notice practicable under the\ncircumstances for all classes certified under Rule 23(b)(3). \nThis includes individual notice to all potential class members\nthat can be identified through reasonable effort.  Notice must,\nin clear, concise and plain language, state:  (i) the nature of\nthe action; (ii) the definition of the class certified; (iii) the\nclass claims, issues or defenses; (iv) the class memberโs right\nto enter an appearance by an attorney; (v) the class memberโs\nright to be excluded from the class; (vi) the time and manner for\nrequesting exclusion; and (vii) the binding effect of settlement\non class members.  See Rule 23(c)(2)(B).  A court must determine\nthat notice was appropriate before evaluating the merits of the\nsettlement itself.  See, e.g., In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 326-\n27.\nIn this case, the notice given met the requirements of\nRule 23(c)(2)(3).  The notice, in all of the forms in which it\nwas disseminated, described the proposed settlement, its terms,\nand the nature of the claim filed on behalf of the class.  It\nalso described the class membersโ right to object or to be\nexcluded from the settlement, including their opportunity to be\n25\n\nheard at the fairness hearing, and the binding effect of the\nsettlement on those who choose not to opt out.\nIndividual notice forms were mailed to 37,159\nidentified class members.  Those notifications that were returned\nas undeliverable were re-sent if another address could be found\nusing a locator database.  Notice was also provided by way of\npublication in the Philadelphia Tribune, Philadelphia Al Dia and\nthe Philadelphia Daily News and through television\nadvertisements.  See Partiesโ Mot. for Class Cert. and\nSettlement, at 1-2. \nBecause individual notices were sent to all identified\nclass members and because the notice was widely disseminated\nthrough local publications and television broadcasts, the Court\nfinds that the notice given meets the requirements of Rule\n23(c)(2)(B).\nC. Approval of the Settlement\nIn order to approve a class settlement, a court must\nfind that the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate and in\nthe best interests of the class under Rule 23(e).  In re General\nMotors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability\nLitigation, 55 F.3d 768, 785 (3d Cir. 1995) (In re General\nMotors).  When considering a class settlement, the โcourt plays\n26\n\nthe important role of protector of the [absent class membersโ]\ninterests, in a sort of fiduciary capacity.โ  Id.\nIn Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153 (3d Cir. 1975), the\nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit set forth the following\nnine specific factors that a district court should consider in\ndetermining whether a settlement is fair, reasonable and\nadequate:  (1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the\nlitigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3)\nthe stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery\ncompleted; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks\nof establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class\naction through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to\nwithstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of\nthe settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; (9)\nthe range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible\nrecovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.  Id.\nat 157.  \nApplying these factors, the Court is satisfied that the\nSettlement is fair, reasonable and adequate to the class members.\n1. The Risks of Establishing Liability and Damages\nThe risks of establishing liability and the risk of\nestablishing damages will be discussed first because these two\nfactors require close attention here.  The Court concludes that\n27\n\nthere is a risk of establishing liability in this case, due to\nthe uncertainty of the law on the constitutionality of blanket\nstrip-search policies such as the one used by the City.  Even if\nliability is established, the Court concludes that there is a\nrisk of establishing damages.  The Court further concludes that,\nbecause of the increased risk for the members of Subclass II, the\ncreation of the subclasses and corresponding difference in\nsettlement amounts is fair, reasonable and adequate under these\nfactors.\n \na. The Constitutionality of the Defendantโs \nStrip-Search Policy                     \nThe status of the case law surrounding the\nconstitutionality of the use of blanket strip-search policies in\nthe prison context has become increasingly uncertain.  Courts in\nseveral circuits have held that, under Bell, the constitution\nrequires strip and visual body cavity searches to be justified by\nat least a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is\nconcealing contraband or weapons.8  These courts have held that it\nis unconstitutional for a prison to have blanket policies that\ncircumvent a minimal-threshold of reasonable suspicion for\narrestees charged with misdemeanors and other minor crimes.  \nThe Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuitโs recent\n8See supra at n. 2.\n28\n\ndecision in Powell rejecting this reading of Bell has created a\nsplit in the circuits on this issue.  See Powell, 541 F.3d at\n1314.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has also\ndecided to reconsider its line of cases on the issue and re-hear\na strip-search case en banc.  See Bull v. City and County of San\nFrancisco, 539 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2008), rehearing en banc\ngranted, 558 F.3d 887 (9th Cir. 2009).  \nThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has yet to\ndecide this issue.  The District Court of New Jersey, however,\nrecently certified the following question to the Court of Appeals\nfor interlocutory appeal:  โWhether a blanket policy of strip\nsearching all inmates upon admission to a county correctional\nfacility is violative of the inmates' constitutional rights?โ \nSee Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of County of\nBurlington, 2009 WL 1971328 at *3 (D.N.J. June 30, 2009).\nThe law concerning the constitutionality of the\ndefendantโs blanket strip-search policy has therefore become\nincreasingly uncertain.  Although this issue may have appeared to\nbe more settled at the outset of litigation, the recent decision\nin Powell, the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit to reconsider its precedent en banc, and the Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuitโs forthcoming consideration of the\nissue come together to make the state of the law more uncertain\ntoday. \n29\n\nEven if the plaintiffs were able to establish the\nCityโs liability, the amount of damages owed to the class members\nwould present a challenge to the plaintiffs.  Calculating the\nvalue of the plaintiffsโ claims will depend upon a number of\nvariables, including the circumstances and severity of the search\nand the effect of the search on the class members.  A\nconsideration of damages also weighs towards settlement.\nb. The Increased Risks of Liability for \nthe Members of Subclass II          \nThe Court must also decide whether the disparity in\nrecovery amounts between the subclasses is fair, reasonable and\nadequate.  The Court concludes that the limited recovery to\nmembers of Subclass II is fair, reasonable and adequate when\nconsidering the increased risk to the members of Subclass II in\nestablishing liability.\nCourts in at least two circuits have stated that a\nviolent or drug-related charge alone creates a reasonable\nsuspicion that would allow prison authorities to strip-search\npretrial detainees like those placed in Subclass II.  See\nMasters, 872 F.2d at 1255 (โIt is objectively reasonable to\nconduct a strip search of one charged with a crime of violence\nbefore that person comes into contact with other inmatesโ); Mary\nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1272 (distinguishing the constitutionality\nof strip-searches where there is no reasonable suspicion for\n30\n\npretrial detainees held on โinherently dangerousโ crimes from the\nunconstitutionality of strip searches of โminor offendersโ). \nUnder this view, even if a court were to find that a blanket\nstrip-search policy was unconstitutional as applied to the\nmembers of Subclass I, it could still find that the policy was\nconstitutional as applied to individuals charged with violence,\ndrug or weapons-related crimes.  These members of Subclass II,\ntherefore, have more of a risk in establishing liability than the\nmembers of Subclass I.\nClass definitions in similar strip-search class actions\noften exclude individuals with violence, drug or weapons-related\ncharges.9  In this case, these subclass members will still receive\nsome relief, which is a more generous result than similarly-\nsituated individuals in other cases have received.  This fact,\ncoupled with the greater risk in establishing liability, makes\nthe settlement for these members of Subclass II under the fourth\nand fifth Girsh factors fair, adequate and reasonable.\nThere is similar support for the inclusion of\nindividuals with preexisting felony or violence, drug or weapons-\nrelated misdemeanor convictions in Subclass II.  At least one\ncourt has explicitly held that reasonable suspicion exists to\n9See, e.g., Bull, 539 F.3d at 1195; McBean, 228 F.R.D. at\n490; Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d at 5 (1st Cir. 2004),\naffirming Nilsen v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19, 19-20 (D. Me.\n2003) and Tardiff v. Knox County, 218 F.R.D. 332, 336 (D. Me.\n2004); Sutton, 2007 WL 119892 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, 2007).\n31\n\nstrip-search all temporary detainees with prior records of felony\nor violence, drug or weapons misdemeanor-misdemeanor convictions. \nSee Smith v. Montgomery County, Md., 643 F.Supp. 435, 439 (D. Md.\n1989) (โReasonable suspicion also exists to strip search all\ntemporary detainees with prior records of convictions or\nunresolved arrests for felony offenses, or for misdemeanors\ninvolving weapons or contrabandโ).  Other courts have held that a\ndetainee's prior record is at least relevant in determining\nwhether or not reasonable suspicion exists.10  For similar reasons\nto those charged with violence, drug or weapons-related crimes,\nthen, individual class members who are included within this\ncategory also stand an increased risk of not establishing\nliability than the members of Subclass I.\n2. The Complexity, Expense, and Likely Duration \nof the Litigation                           \nThe first Girsh factor, the complexity, duration, and\nexpense of the litigation, weighs towards settlement in this\n10See Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (โReasonable suspicion may be\nbased on such factors as the nature of the offense, the\narrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest recordโ);\nBoyd, 613 F.Supp. at 1525 (finding that reasonable suspicion\nโcould be based on the nature of the offense, the detainee's\ncriminal history, the demeanor of the individual, and the results\nof any other search ... which the defendants may choose to\nconductโ); Ninneman, 612 F.Supp. at 1071; Hunter, 672 F.2d at 671\n(noting that the strip-searched parties had never been convicted\nof a drug offense).\n32\n\ncase.  At trial, the plaintiffs would face the task of proving\nthe unconstitutionality of the defendantโs policy, which would be\ncomplex, expensive and, as discussed in more detail above, risky. \nThese facts make settlement the best option under the first Girsh\nfactor. \n3. The Reaction of the Class to the Settlement \nThe second factor, reaction of the class, also favors\napproval of the settlement.  Out of over 37,000 potential class\nmembers, only three have formally objected.  A low number of\nobjectors compared to the number of potential class members\ncreates a strong presumption in favor of approving the\nsettlement.  See In re Cendant Corp. Litigation, 264 F.3d 201,\n234-35 (3d Cir. 2001).  Moreover, only five class members chose\nto opt out of the class.  The fact that so few potential class\nmembers objected to or opted out of the settlement supports a\nfinding of general acceptance of the settlement in the class.\n4. The Stage of the Proceedings and the Amount \nof Discovery Completed                     \n \nThe third factor, the stage of the proceeding and the\namount of discovery, similarly weighs towards acceptance of the\nsettlement.  Post-discovery settlements are more likely to\nreflect the true value of the claim.  Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nBolger, 2 F.3d 1304 (3d Cir. 1993).  Discovery has been extensive\n33\n\nhere, with numerous depositions taken and hundreds of documents\nreviewed by the parties.  The discovery and other investigations\nthat the parties have undertaken render them sufficiently\ninformed to make a determination about the fairness of a\nsettlement. \n5. The Risks of Maintaining the Class Action \nThrough Trial and the Ability of the \nDefendants to Withstand a Greater Judgment\nThe sixth and seventh Girsh factors, the risk of\nmaintaining the class action through trial and the ability of the\ndefendants to withstand a greater judgment, are neutral issues in\nthis particular case.  \nAlthough there are no factors to indicate a likelihood\nthat this class could not have been maintained through trial,\nthere is always some risk of decertification in any class action.\nThe risk of decertification is therefore present here, but it is\nno more substantial than the risk present in any class action. \nSimilarly, the defendants in this case, a major city,\nshould under normal circumstances be able to withstand a greater\njudgment.  Taking into consideration the current financial\nsituation of the City, however, the plaintiffs do have cause to\nbe genuinely concerned about the ability of the defendant to\nallocate its resources to a greater judgment.\n34\n\n6. The Reasonableness of the Settlement in Light \nof the Best Possible Recovery and the \nAttendant Risks of Litigation                \nFinally, the eighth and ninth factors, the\nreasonableness of the settlement in light of the best possible\nrecovery and the attendant risks of litigation, support approval\nof the settlement.  The reasonableness of a proposed settlement\ndepends in part upon a comparison of the present value of the\ndamages the plaintiffs would recover if successful, discounted by\nthe risks of not prevailing.  In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at\n806.  \nConsidering the risks of litigation and the uncertainty\nof the law in this area, the disparity between the settlement\namount and a possibly greater recovery amount is reasonable. \nMoreover, the approximately $1400 granted to the members of\nSubclass I is commensurate with the amounts received by class\nmembers in settlements of similar actions.11  The approximately\n$100 granted to the members of Subclass II is also fair given\nthat individuals meeting the definition of Subclass II are often\ncompletely excluded from recovery in strip-search cases.  Because\n11See Hicks v. The County of Camden, 05-cv-1857 (D.N.J. June\n9, 2008) (awarding an estimated $1,025 per claimant); McBean v.\nCity of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 388 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (awarding\neither $750 or $1000 per claimant, depending upon the number of\ntimes the prisoner was searched); Kahler v. County of Rensselaer,\nNo. 03-cv-1324 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (awarding $1,000 per claimant) \nDoan v. Watson, 2002 WL 1730917 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 4, 2002)\n(awarding $1,000 per claimant). \n35\n\nof the risk that the class members might not recover at all and\nbecause the amounts received are commensurate with, and even\nexceed, the amounts awarded in similar class actions, these last\ntwo factors weigh towards granting the settlement.\nAfter applying the Girsh factors, the Court concludes\nthat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate under Rule\n23(e).  All but two of the Girsh factors weigh in favor of\napproving the settlement.  Those other two factors are neutral. \nFor these reasons, the Court approves the Settlement under Rule\n23(e).\n \nD. The Attorneysโ Fee Petition\nClass counsel in a class action who recovers a common\nfund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client\nis entitled to a fair and reasonable award of attorneysโ fees\nfrom the fund as a whole.  Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U.S.\n472, 478 (1980).  Class counsel calculate their fee award using\nthe percentage-of-recovery method, which is the method favored in\ncommon fund cases.  See In re General Motors, 148 F.3d at 333. \nThey also use the alternative method of fee calculation, the\nlodestar method, as a cross-check in order to ensure that the fee\namount is reasonable.  See, e.g., In re Insurance Brokerage\nAntitrust Litigation, 2009 WL 2855855 at *31.\n36\n\nAs a result of these calculations, class counsel seek\nan award of attorneyโs fees of 30% of the $5.9 million settlement\nfund, which amounts to $1,770,000.  Class counsel also seek a\nreimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses of $70,094.24.  They also\nrequest that the Court award an additional $100,000.00 to the\nclaims administrator.  Finally, class counsel request an award to\nthe class representatives of $15,000 each. \nThe Court finds that all of these requests are\nreasonable and grants class counselsโ motion.\n1. The Reasonableness of the Fees\nWhen the percentage-of-recovery method is used to\ndetermine attorneysโ fees in a common fund case, the Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit requires the district courts to\nconsider seven factors for determining the reasonableness of the\nfee.  Gunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp., 223 F.3d 190 (3d Cir.\n2000).  These are:  (1) the size of the fund created and the\nnumber of persons benefitted; (2) the presence or absence of\nsubstantial objections by members of the class to the settlement\nterms and/or fees requested by counsel; (3) the skill and\nefficiency of the attorneys involved; (4) the complexity and\nduration of the litigation; (5) the risk of nonpayment; (6) the\namount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs' counsel; and\n(7) the awards in similar cases.  Gunter, 223 F.3d at 195 n.1. \n37\n\nAll factors weigh in favor of approving the attorneysโ fee\npetition in this case.\nThe first Gunter factor, the size of the fund created\nand number of persons benefitted, favors the fee amount, as class\ncounsel were able to obtain a sizable result, $5.9 million, for a\npotential class of 37,000 individuals.  \nThe second factor, the number of substantial\nobjections, also weighs in class counselsโ favor.  Only three\nobjections have been entered to the settlement generally and just\none to the proposed attorneyโs fees and costs.  \nThe third factor, the skill and efficiency of the\nattorneys involved, supports approval of the attorneysโ fee\nrequest.  Class counsel are highly skilled in this area and have\nconducted at least twenty other strip-search class actions.  The\nsubmissions made in this case were thorough and of high quality. \nFinally, class counsel worked effectively and efficiently to\nbring this action to settlement.  The skill and efficiency\nbrought to this action by class counsel support the fee request.\nThe fourth and fifth factors, the complexity and\nduration of the litigation and the risk of nonpayment, also\nsupport approval of class counselsโ fee request.  As discussed\nabove, this case involves a complicated issue of constitutional\nlaw, the outcome of which has become increasingly uncertain over\nthe time of this litigation.  Class counselsโ work was performed\n38\n\non a contingent basis, and they have not been reimbursed.  Given\nthe four years spent on this litigation, the fee requested is\nreasonable for the time, effort and risk involved.\nThe sixth factor, the amount of time devoted by\ncounsel, supports the fee amount.  Class counsel documents\n2,857.65 hours of contingent work on this litigation, justifying\nthe amount requested in their petition.  This determination is\nconfirmed by the reasonable outcome of the lodestar cross-check,\nas discussed below.  \nThe seventh Gunter factor, the awards granted in\nsimilar cases, also supports the fee amount.  The percentage of\n30% requested by class counsel is within the range the\npercentages granted in similar cases and class action settlements\ngenerally.  A study referenced by another court in this district\nanalyzed 289 class action settlements ranging from under $1\nmillion to $50 million and determined that the average attorneysโ\nfees percentage to be 31.71% and the median to be one-third.  In\nre Rite Aid Corp. Securities Litigation, 146 F.Supp.2d 706, 735\n(E.D.Pa. 2001) (affirming a fee amount of 25%).  Furthermore, a\n30% fee percentage is commensurate with other strip-search class\nactions conducted by class counsel.12\n12See Suggs v. Cumberland County, 1:06-CV-00087 (D.N.J.)\n(approving a 30% fee percentage); Boiselle v. Mercer County,\n3:06-CV-2065 (D.N.J.) (same); Clark v. County of Salem, 07-CV-\n2259 (D.N.J.) (same); Hicks v. County of Camden, 1:05-CV-1854\n(D.N.J.) (approving a 27.5% fee percentage).\n39\n\nUnder the Gunter factors, then, an attorneysโ fee award\nof 30% of the fund is reasonable.\nThe lodestar cross-check analysis further supports the\nreasonableness of the attorneyโs fees.  Under the lodestar\nmethod, the court calculates the proper fee by multiplying the\nnumber of hours spent on the litigation by an appropriate hourly\nrate.  See In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 819 n.37.  Although\nthe resulting multiplier need not fall within any pre-defined\nrange, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has noted that\nmultiples ranging from one to four are frequently awarded in\ncommon fund cases when the lodestar method is applied.  See In re\nPrudential, 148 F.3d at 341.\nIn this case, class counselsโ requested fee produces a\nmultiplier of 2.3 using the historic rate calculation, a method\nby which hours expended by each attorney are grouped into\nhistorical time periods and multiplied by the attorneyโs hourly\nrate for that time period.13  A multiple of 2.3 reached under the\nhistoric rate calculation is safely within the reasonable\nmultiplier range and confirms the reasonableness of class\ncounselsโ fee request.\n13Courts also use the โcurrent lodestar method,โ by which\nthe total hours expended by each attorney are multiplied by that\nattorney's hourly rate at the conclusion of the case.  See, e.g.,\nMissouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 283-84 (1980); New York State\nAss'n for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 711 F.2d 1136, 1153\n(2d Cir. 1983).  Class counsel reports that under this method\nโthe lodestar amount would be higher but the multiplier would be\nlower.โ  Pl.โs Joint Mot. for Fees and Expenses at 20 n.9. \n40\n\n2. Reimbursement of Out-of-Pocket Expenses\nClass counsel have requested additional reimbursement\nin the amount of $70,094.24 for their out-of-pocket expenses for\nthe management of the common fund for the benefit of the class\nmembers.\nClass counsel provided a breakdown for each firm or\nlawyer that separates the out-of-pocket expenses into broad\ncategories.  The categories include amounts spent for postage,\nmail and courier services; photocopying; telephone and facsimile;\nfiling and litigation fees; meals, hotels, and transportation;\npublications; research; and assessments.  The totals for each\ncategory are reasonable expenses for a large, complex, multi-year\nlitigation. \nFinally, class counsel has requested that the Court\ngrant an additional $100,000.00 to the administrator for extra\nclass administration costs.  This request is reasonable and is\ngranted.\nThe Court therefore approves class counselsโ request\nfor an award of out-of-pocket expenses in the amount of\n$70,094.24 and the award of an additional $100,000.00 to the\nclaims administrator.\n41\n\n3.  Awards to the Class Representatives\nClass counsel requests a special award of $15,000 for\neach class representative.  Other strip-search settlements\nprovide similar awards to class representatives.14  \nThese awards, though high, are justified by the benefit\nprovided to the absent class members.  The class representatives\nhave accepted the public exposure of the fact that they have been\nplaced into custody and charged with a crime.  They do so for the\nbenefit of the class, and the Court finds that these awards are\nreasonable compensation for the sacrifice of their anonymity. \nV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons herein stated, the Court grants the\nplaintiffsโ and defendantโs Motion for Final Approval of\nSettlement and Class Certification.  The Court hereby certifies\nthe class and approves the settlement in this class action as\ndescribed in that motion.\nThe Court also grants class counselsโ Joint Motion for\nFees and Expenses.\nAn appropriate Order shall issue separately.\n14See Hicks v. City of Camden, No. 05-CV-1857 (awarding\n$15,000 to two class representatives); Suggs v. Cumberland\nCounty, 1:06-CV-00087 (D.N.J.) (same); Boiselle v. Mercer County,\n3:06-CV-2065 (D.N.J.) (awarding $20,000 to one class\nrepresentative); McBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 391-\n92 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (awarding between $25,000 and $35,000 to class\nrepresentatives).\n42",

McLaughlin, U.S.D.J. on September 29, 2009, pursuant\nto this Courtโs Order of March 6, 2009, in order for this\nCourt to conduct a final fairness hearing to determine whether\nthe proposed Settlement Agreement between the Parties is fair,\nreasonable and adequate, and to address Class Counselโs\napplication for an award of attorneyโs fees and costs; and the\nSettlement Class Members being represented by Class Counsel\nand Defendant being represented by its attorney; AND THE COURT\nhaving read and considered the Settlement Agreement, the\nNotice Plan, and Memorandum of Law submitted by Class Counsel,\nhaving received evidence at the hearing, having heard\narguments from Class Counsel and the Defendant, and having\nconsidered the submissions by Class Members, now makes the\nfollowing:\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. This action was commenced on April 21, 2005, as a\nclass action.\n\n2. After several years of intensive litigation,\nincluding extensive discovery and motion practice, and as a\nresult of intensive, armโs length negotiations between Class\nCounsel and Defendant, including settlement conferences before\nMagistrate Judge Elizabeth T. Hey and former Magistrate Judge\nJames K. Melinson, the Parties have reached accord with\nrespect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to\nSettlement Class Members, in return for a release and\ndismissal of the claims at issue in this case against the\nDefendant (โSettlement Agreementโ).  The resulting Settlement\nAgreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on March 6,\n2009.\n3. As part of the Order Granting Preliminary\nApproval, this Court approved a proposed Notice Plan and Class\nNotice, which provided Settlement Class Members notice of the\nproposed Settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an opportunity\nfor Class Members to file objections to the Settlement, and an\nopportunity to opt-out of the Settlement.\n4. As of the deadline for the filing of objections,\nthree objections were filed.  Given the size of this\nSettlement, and the Notice Plan described above, this Court\nfinds that the comparatively low number of objections is\nindicative of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the\nSettlement with the Defendant.\n5. The settling Parties have filed with the Court an\naffidavit from RSM McGladrey, Inc. declaring that the mailing\n2\n\nof the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan,\nhas been completed.\n6. The Court finds that the published notice, mailed\nnotice and Internet posting constitute the best practicable\nnotice of the Fairness Hearing, proposed Settlement, Class\nCounselโs application for fees and expenses, and other matters\nset forth in the Class Notice and Short Form Notice; and that\nsuch notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to\nall members of the Settlement Class, and complied fully with\nthe requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, the Constitution of the United States, the laws of\nPennsylvania and any other applicable law.\n7. Any persons who wished to be excluded from this\naction were provided an opportunity to โopt-outโ pursuant to\nthe Notice.  All persons who have validly excluded themselves\nfrom the action have no rights under the Settlement Agreement\nand shall not be bound by the Settlement Agreement or the\nfinal judgment herein and the names of those persons are set\nforth in Exhibit A hereto. \n8. Settlement Class Members are bound by the\nSettlement, Settlement Agreement, Release contained within\nthe Settlement Agreement, and the Final Order and Judgment.\nSettlement Class Members do not have a further opportunity to\nopt-out of this Action.\n9. Any Class Member who did not timely file and serve\nan objection in writing to the Settlement Agreement, to the\n3\n\nentry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Class Counselโs\napplication for fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with\nthe procedure set forth in the Class Notice and mandated in\nthe Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is\ndeemed to have waived any such objection by appeal,\ncollateral attack, or otherwise.\n10. On the basis of all of the issues in this\nlitigation, and the provisions of the Settlement Agreement,\nthe Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair,\nreasonable and adequate compromise of the claims against the\nDefendant in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors\nwhich the Court has considered in affirming this Settlement,\nincluding:\na. The liability issues in this case have been\nvigorously contested.\nb.  This Settlement has the benefit of providing\nrelief to Class Members now, without further\nlitigation, under circumstances where the liability\nissues are still vigorously contested among the Parties\nto this litigation.  This Settlement provides Class\nMembers with a substantial monetary benefit.  \nc. This Settlement is clearly a product of hard-\nfought litigation between the Parties, and not a result\nof any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or\nCounsel for the Defendant.\n4\n\n11. Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on\nthe Defendant their application for reasonable attorneysโ\nfees, costs, and expenses consistent with the terms of the\nSettlement Agreement.  This Court has considered Class\nCounselโs request and hereby grants the request.\n12. The claims procedure established under the\nSettlement Agreement is fair, a simplified process, and\nworkable.  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction\nto work out any unanticipated problems.\nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS\nOF FACT, THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS OF\nLAW:\n13. This Court has jurisdiction over the Parties and\nthe subject matter of this proceeding.\n14. Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, the following Settlement Class is certified for\npurposes of final settlement:\nSettlement Class:\nAll  persons  who  were  placed  into  the\ncustody  of  the  Philadelphia  Prison\nSystem  after  being  charged  with\nmisdemeanors; summary offenses; traffic\ninfractions, civil commitments, or other\nminor crimes; or bench warrants and/or\nprobation  violations  where  the\nunderlying  charge  was  a  misdemeanor,\nsummary  offense  or  other  minor  crime;\nand  who  were  strip  searched  in  the\nabsence  of  reasonable  suspicion  upon\ntheir entry into the Philadelphia Prison\nSystem  pursuant  to  the  policy,  custom\nand practice of the Philadelphia Prison\n5\n\nSystem and the City of Philadelphia. The\nclass period commences on April 21, 2003\nand extends to, and includes, October 9,\n2007.\nSubclass I:\nAll  persons  in  the  Settlement  Class,\nEXCEPT for persons who (1) were charged\nwith  certain  violence,  drug  and/or\nweapons  (hereinafter  โVDWโ)  related\nmisdemeanor charges at the time of their\nadmission,  or  (2)  were  charged  with\nbench  warrants  and/or  probation\nviolations  where  the  underlying  charge\nwas a VDW misdemeanor charge, or (3) had\nconvictions  for  felonies  and/or  VDW\nmisdemeanor  charges  predating  the  date\nof their admission.\nSubclass II:\nAll persons in the Settlement Class who\nwere  (1)  charged  with  VDW  misdemeanor\ncharges at the time of their admission,\nor (2) were charged with bench warrants\nand/or  probation  violations  where  the\nunderlying charge was a VDW misdemeanor\ncharge,  or  (3)  had  convictions  for\nfelonies and/or VDW misdemeanor charges\npredating the date of their admission.\n15. The Court finds that, for the purpose of this\nSettlement, the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a class action is\nan appropriate method for resolving the disputes in this\nlitigation.  All the prerequisites for class certification\nunder Rule 23 are present.  The Class Members are\nascertainable and too numerous to be joined.  Questions of\nlaw and fact common to all Class Members predominate over\nindividual issues and should be determined in one proceeding\nwith respect to all Class Members.  The Class\n6\n\nRepresentativesโ claims are typical of those of the Class. \nThe Class action mechanism is superior to alternative means\nfor adjudicating and resolving this action.\n16. The Settlement Class Representatives, Nakisha\nBoone and George Byrd, are entitled to and are hereby\nawarded a payment of $15,000 each, in recognition of the\nefforts they undertook in connection with this lawsuit. All\nClass Members who have made claims on the settlement are\nentitled to receive their pro rata share of the Settlement\nfund, as members of Subclass I not to exceed $3,000 or\nSubclass II not to exceed $100, after administrative\nexpenses, attorneysโ fees and expenses, and incentive awards\nare deducted from the fund. \n17. Class Counsel are qualified, experienced, and\nhave aggressively litigated this case, thereby demonstrating\ntheir adequacy as counsel for the Settlement Class.  Daniel\nC. Levin, Esquire of Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman,\nPhiladelphia, PA; Charles J. LaDuca, Esquire and Alexandra\nWarren, Esquire of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, Washington,\nDC; Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire of the Law Offices of\nElmer Robert Keach, III, Amsterdam, New York; and Gary E.\nMason, Esquire and Nicholas A. Migliaccio, Esquire of the\nMason Law Firm, LLP are hereby appointed as counsel for the\nSettlement Class.\n18. The Court grants final approval of the\nSettlement Agreement, as being fair, reasonable and\n7\n\nadequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.The Courts finds that the request for attorneysโ\nfees is reasonable.\nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, IT IS HEREBY\nORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED AS FOLLOWS:\n1. The Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed\nSettlement is GRANTED.\n2.

For at least the past 10 years, the Philadelphia\nPrison Systems (\"PPS\") has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the\nCity of Philadelphiaโs jail facilities and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the\ncrime upon which they are charged. Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part,\nderived from the written procedures of the PPS, and was promulgated by the City of\nPhiladelphia.\nIt has been well established that individuals charged with misdemeanors or\nsummary offenses cannot be strip-searched absent particularized suspicion that they\npossess weapons or contraband. In short, the policy of PPS and the City of to force those\ncharged with minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into\ntheir jail facilities is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.\n\nNakisha Boone and George Byrd (\"Plaintiffs\") bring this action on behalf of\nthemselves, and on behalf of a class of thousands of others who were strip searched after\nbeing charged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their\ncivil rights and those of the class members they propose to represent. These individuals\nwere charged with misdemeanor offenses and were subjected to a strip search, in\nviolation of their rights against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of\nthe United States Constitution. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for themselves and for\neach member of the proposed class, a declaration that City of Philadelphiaโs policies are\nunconstitutional, and an injunction precluding City of Philadelphia and the PPS from\ncontinuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody. With this as a\nbackground, Plaintiffs, Nakisha Boone and George Byrd complain as follows:\nII. JURISDICTION\nThis Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ยงยง\n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive\ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights\nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. ยงยง 1981 & 1983. This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the\nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government.\n1. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e)(2) because the events giving\nrise to Plaintiffsโ claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial\ndistrict.\n\nIII. PARTIES\n2. Plaintiff Nakisha Boone resides at 308North Redfield Street,\nPhiladelphia, PA 19139. On November 13, 2004, Ms.Boone was detained on\nmisdemeanor charges - a bench warrant relative to a 1998 misdemeanor charge of\nendangering the welfare of a child - following a traffic stop by the Philadelphia Police\nDepartment. Ms. Boone was transported to the Riverside Correctional Facility (\"RCF\")\nthe following day. As a result of this detention, Ms. Boone was strip searched during the\nbooking process at RCF. Specifically, she was required to remove all her clothes and\nsquat before a Corrections Officer. She was also forced to bend over and spread the\nlobes of her buttocks. The six year old criminal charges upon which Ms. Boone was\ndetained were later dismissed by the Philadelphia City Municipal Court.\n3. Plaintiff, George Byrd resides at 5 Landbourn Path, Sewell, NJ 08080. On\nApril 2, 2005, Mr. Byrd was detained on misdemeanor charges relating to driving under\nthe influence of the alcohol. Mr. Byrd was transported to the Philadelphia Prison System.\nAs a result of his detention, Mr. Byrd was strip searched during his booking process.\nSpecifically, he was required to move all clothes and squat before a Corrections Officer.\n4. Defendant City of Philadelphia is a Municipality located in Pennsylvania.\nDefendant, City of Philadelphia, is responsible for enacting uniform policies and\noverseeing the PPS. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant City of Philadelphia was\nresponsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all\nmatters pertaining to the PPS and was responsible for the appointment, training,\nsupervision and conduct of all personnel including those working for the PPS. In\n\naddition, at all times relevant hereto, Defendant, together with the PPS, was responsible\nfor enforcing the rules of the PPS.\nIV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n5. Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated\nindividuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip\nsearched upon their entry into the PPS.\n6. The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows:\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the\nPPS after being charged with misdemeanors, summary offenses,\nviolations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil\ncommitments or other minor crimes and were or will be strip\nsearched upon their entry into the Philadelphia Prison System\npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the PPS and the City\nof Philadelphia. The class period commences on April 21, 2003 and\nextends to the present or until the defendants are enjoined from, or\notherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and\ncustom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion.\nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendant and any and all\nof their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors,\nemployees or assignees.\n7. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class\naction under Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and\nadequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).\n8. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder\nimpracticable. Upon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for\nmisdemeanors and summary offenses who are placed into the custody of the PPS every\nmonth - all of whom are members of the proposed class. Upon information and belief,\n4\n\nthe size of the proposed class totals at least 30,000 individuals, some of whom have had\ntheir civil rights violated on multiple occasions.\n9. Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is\nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class\nmembers are likely dispersed over a large geographical area, with some members\npresently residing outside of Philadelphia County and this Judicial District. Furthermore,\nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may\nnot speak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights\nindividually.\n10. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in\nthat they all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants\nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion. All members of the class were\ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the PPS, and\nall were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established law in this judicial\ncircuit.\n11. Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.\nPlaintiffs and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendantsโ\ncourse of conduct. The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered\nby the class members.\n12. The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the\noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.\nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class.\n\n13. Plaintiffs have retained counsel who has substantial experience and\nsuccess in the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation. The named Plaintiff\nis being represented by Daniel C. Levin of Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman; Elmer\nRobert Keach, III, Law Offices of Elmer Robert Keach, III, PC; Gary E. Mason and\nAlexander Barnett of The Mason Law Firm, PLLC; Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca\nof Cuneo, Gilbert and LaDuca, LLP; Christopher Hayes, Law Offices of Christopher\nHayes, Laura Feldman of Feldman & Pinto, and Kevin Birley of Ostriat Associates, LLC.\nProposed Class Counsel has significant experience in class actions and civil rights\nlitigation.\n14. In short, Plaintiffsโ counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to\nsuccessfully prosecute this action against the Defendant. Counsel for Plaintiff knows of\nno conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class.\n15. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, the\nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members\nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged\nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the PPS. In short, the\nPPS acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members.\n16. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative,\nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).\n17. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class,\nand predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.\nThese common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and\npredominate question of whether the Defendantโs written and/or de facto policy of strip\n6\n\nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to\nthe PPS is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution, and whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the class\nperiod.\n18. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and\nefficient adjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members\nof the class is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that\nthey are dispersed over a large geographical area. Furthermore, the expense and burden\nof individual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of\nthe class to redress the wrongs done to them. The cost to the federal court system of\nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous. Individualized litigation\nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system. By\ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer\nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and\nprotects the rights of each member of the Class.\n19. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address\nthe Defendantsโ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even\nthough the Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the\npast 10 years.\n20. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs\nalso seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).\n\nFACTS\nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally\n21. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits\ngovernment agencies and state officials, such as the Defendant in this action and the\nCorrections Officers they supervise, from performing strip searches of arrestees who have\nbeen charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes unless there is a reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband.\n22. The City of Philadelphia, has instituted a written and/or de facto policy,\ncustom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the PPS and\nare placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without\nthe presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a\nweapon or contraband.\n23. The City of Philadelphia, has instituted a written and/or de facto policy,\ncustom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the\nvaginal and rectal cavities) and strip searches (involving the removal of clothing for a\nvisual inspection) on all individuals who enter their custody, regardless of the individual\ncharacteristics or the nature of their charged crime. For purposes of this Complaint, strip\nand visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as \"strip searches.\"\n24. The City of Philadelphia knows that they may not institute, enforce or\npermit enforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without\nparticularized, reasonable suspicion. This Court and the Federal Courts of Appeal have\nstated repeatedly that state officials may not strip search individuals charged with\nmisdemeanors or violations absent particularized, reasonable suspicion.\n\n25. The Defendantโs written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom\nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been\npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established\nlaw.\n26. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the\nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged,\nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\n27. The City of Philadelphia has promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or\nfailed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all\nindividuals placed into the custody of the PPS and placed into jail clothing without any\nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort. This written and/or\nde facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature\nof the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a\nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of\nroutine strip searches.\n28. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class,\nincluding every named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry\ninto the Philadelphia Prison System. These searches were conducted without inquiry into\nor establishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable\nsuspicion. Strip searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among other\ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing.\n29. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted\npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches -\n9\n\neach member of the class, including every named Plaintiff- has suffered or will suffer\npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs\nA.    Nakisha Boone\n30. Ms. Booneโs experience is representative. On or about October 22, 2004\nat approximately 6:30 PM, Plaintiff Nakisha Boone was arrested on a bench warrant\nrelative to a criminal charge originally prosecuted against her in 1998. The charge in\nquestion, endangering the welfare of a child, is a first degree misdemeanor under 18\nP.C.S.A. ยง 4304. Ms. Booneโs arrest occurred after she was stopped for a traffic\nviolation. The circumstances of her criminal chares are that she is alleged to have left her\nchildren alone, thereby endangering their welfare. The misdemeanor criminal charges\npending against her were later dismissed.\n31. The following morning, Ms. Boone was transported to the Riverside\nCorrectional Facility, a component facility of the Philadelphia Prison System, and was\nbooked into the facility. Approximately 24 hours later, Ms. Boone was moved into a\nroom in the booking area of RCF and ordered to remove her clothing. Ms. Boone was\nthen instructed to \"squat and cough,\" and then to bend over and spread the lobes of her\nbuttocks to allow for a visual examination of her vagina and anus. Ms. Boone was then\nprovided with a jail uniform.\n32. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe\nthat Ms. Boone was concealing a weapon or other contraband. Indeed, no inquiry was\nmade of Ms. Boone that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion\nnecessary to conduct a strip search.\n10\n\n33. 34. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search\nconducted pursuant to the Defendantsโ policy, practice and custom, Plaintiff has suffered\nand continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\nB~    George Byrd\n35. Mr. Byrdโs experience is representative of the class. On April 2, 2005,\nMr. Byrd was strip searched at the Philadelphia Prison System. The charge in question\nwas driving under the influence. Mr. Byrdโs arrest occurred after he was stopped in his\ncar where he was parked on the side of the road. The misdemeanor criminal charges\npending against him were later dismissed.\n36. Mr. Byrd was transferred to the Philadelphia Prison System where he was\nbooked into the facility. Mr. Byrd was instructed to squat and cough and then bend over\nand spread the lobes of his buttocks to allow visual examination. Mr. Byrd was then\nprovided a jail uniform.\n37. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe\nthat Mr. Byrd was concealing a weapon or other contraband. Indeed, no inquiry was\nmade to Mr. Byrd that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion\nnecessary to conduct a strip search.\n38. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted\npursuant to Defendantโs policy, practice and custom, Plaintiff, George Byrd has suffered\nand continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\n11\n\nVI. CAUSES OF ACTION\nA FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DEFENDANT\n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid\nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law --\n39. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation\nstated in paragraphs 1 through 38.\n40. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens\nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from\nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent\nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or\nweapons.\n41. The actions of Defendant detailed above violated Plaintiffsโ rights under\nthe United States Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for the City\nof Philadelphia to strip search Plaintiffs and class members based on their arrests for\nmisdemeanor or other minor criminal charges.\n42. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or\npractice of the City of Philadelphia. As such, the City of Philadelphia is directly liable\nfor the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the Class.\n43. Upon information and belief, City of Philadelphia is responsible for\nestablishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the PPS, and is\nresponsible for the implementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.\nAs such, the Defendant is responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and\nmembers of the Class.\n12\n\n44. The Defendant knew that the strip search policy, practice or custom was\nillegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and\nmembers of the Class of their Constitutional rights.\n45. This conduct on the part of the City of Philadelphia represents a violation\nof 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law.\n46. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described\nabove, Plaintiff and members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured.\nA SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DEFENDANT\n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n47. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation\nstated in paragraphs 1 through 46.\n48. The policy, custom and practice of the City of Philadelphia is clearly\nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip\nsearches of all individuals placed into the PPS without any particularized suspicion that\nthe individuals in question have either contraband or weapons.\n49. Plaintiffs and members of the Class request that this Court issue a\ndeclaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of\nPhiladelphia to be unconstitutional.\nA THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DEFENDANT\n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n50. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation\nstated in paragraphs 1 through 49.\n13\n\n51. The policy, custom and practice of the City of Philadelphia is clearly\nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip\nsearches of all individuals placed into the PPS without any particularized suspicion that\nthe individuals in question have either contraband or weapons.\n52. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the PPS,\nwith new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have\nalready been inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs.\n53. The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor\ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class,\nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law.\n54. Plaintiffs demand that the City of Philadelphia immediately desist from\nstrip searching individuals placed into the custody of the Philadelphia Prison System\nabsent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband\nor weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court\nordering as much.\nVII. DEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY\n57. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Nakisha Boone and George Byrd, on behalf of\nthemselves and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated, requests that this\nHonorable Court grant them the following relief:\n14\n\nA.    An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.\n23.\nB.    A judgment against Defendant on Plaintiffsโ First Cause of Action detailed\nherein, awarding Compensatory and Punitive Damages to the named Plaintiff and each\nmember of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury and/or the Court\non both an individual and a class wide basis.\nC.    A declaratory judgment against Defendant declaring the City of\nPhiladelphia and the PPSโ policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity searching\nall detainees entering the system, regardless of the crime charged or reasonable suspicion\nof contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper.\nD.    A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendant from\ncontinuing to strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or\nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the\nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband.\nE. A monetary award for attorneyโs fees and the costs of this action, pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23;\nRespectfully submitted by..;,.~\nDated: c~/9- -~/0 \"] Daniel C. L~vin.

KAHANA, \nREGINALD HAMMOND, JOHN  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nMURPHY, and \nROBERT TOMASZEWSKI, \nDefendants. \nINTRODUCTION \nThis is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights \nsecured to the Plaintiff and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws \nof the United States of America.  For at least the past 10 years, the Philadelphia Prison \nSystems (\"PPS\") has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the City of \nPhiladelphia's jail facilities and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon \nwhich they are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from \nthe written procedures of the PPS, and was promulgated by senior Department officials; \n\nspecifically, Defendants Commissioner Leon A.  King, II and the remaining individual \ndefendants. \nIt has  been well  established  that  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or \nviolations  cannot be  strip-searched  absent  particularized suspicion  that they possess \nweapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of PPS, City of Philadelphia and individual \ndefendants to force those charged with minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip \nsearch upon entry into their jail facilities is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and \nunnecessary. \nNakisha Boone (\"Boone\") brings this action on behalf of herself, and on behalf of \na class of thousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty \ncrimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their civil rights and those of \nthe  class  members  they  propose  to  represent.  This  individual  was  charged with  a \nmisdemeanor offense and was subject to a strip search, in violation of her rights against \nunreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \nPlaintiff seeks monetary damages for herself and each member of the proposed class, a \ndeclaration that City of Philadelphia's policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction \nprecluding City of Philadelphia and the PPS from continuing to violate the rights of those \nplaced into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiff Nakisha Boone complains \nas follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.c. \nยงยง  1331,  1341  &  1343  because it is filed to  obtain compensatory damages, punitive \n2 \n\ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C.  ยงยง  1981  &  1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.c. ยง 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise \nto  Plaintiff s  claims  and those  of proposed class  members  occurred  in  this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Nakisha Boone resides at 308 North Redfield Street, Philadelphia, \nPA 19139.  On November 13, 2004, Ms. Boone was detained on misdemeanor charges \na bench warrant relative to a 1998 misdemeanor charge of endangering the welfare of a \nchild - following a traffic stop by the Philadelphia Police Department.  Ms. Boone was \ntransported to the Riverside Correctional Facility (\"RCF\") the following day.  As a result \nof this  detention, Ms.  Boone was strip searched during the booking process at RCF. \nSpecifically, she was required to remove all her clothes and squat before a Corrections \nOfficer.  She was also forced to bend over and spread the lobes of her buttocks.  The six \nyear old criminal charges upon which Ms. Boone was detained were later dismissed by \nthe Philadelphia City Municipal Court. \n4.

The Individual Defendants detailed above are collectively referred to as the \n\"Policy Making Defendants\" in this Complaint. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b )(2)  and 23(b )(3)  of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of herself and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals  who  were  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  minor  crimes  and  were  strip \nsearched upon their entry into the PPS. \n17. The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \n6 \n\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nPPS after being charged with misdemeanor violations, violations of \nprobation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other \nminor crimes and were or will be strip searched upon their entry into \nthe PPS pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the PPS and \nthe City of Philadelphia.  The class period commences on April 21, \n2003 and extends to the present or until the defendants are enjoined \nfrom,  or otherwise  cease,  enforcing their unconstitutional policy, \npractice and custom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable \nsuspicion.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and \nany and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees. \n18. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n19. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the PPS every month - all of whom are \nmembers of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed \nclass totals at least 30,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated \non mUltiple occasions. \n20. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the  large number of class members  and the  fact  that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Philadelphia County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindividually. \n7 \n\n21. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants' \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the PPS, and \nall were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established law in this judicial \ncircuit. \n22. Plaintiff's  claims  are  typical of the  claims  of the  members  of the  Class. \nPlaintiff and all members of the  class  sustained damages arising out of Defendants' \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n23. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff \nhas no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n24. Plaintiff has retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiff is being \nrepresented by Daniel C.  Levin of Levin, Fishbein, Sedran &  Berman; Elmer Robert \nKeach, III, Law Offices of Elmer Robert Keach, III, PC; Gary E. Mason and Charles \nSchneider of The Mason Law Firm, PLLC; Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of \nCuneo,  Waldman and Gilbert,  LLP;  Christopher Hayes,  Law  Offices  of Christopher \nHayes, Laura Feldman of Feldman & Pinto, and Kevin Birley ofOstriat Associates, LLC. \nProposed Class  Counsel  has  significant  experience  in  class  actions  and  civil  rights \nlitigation. \n8 \n\n25. In short,  Plaintiff s counsel has the  resources,  expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully  prosecute  this  action  against  the  Defendants  and  the  Policy  Making \nDefendants.  Counsel for Plaintiff knows of no conflicts among members of the class, or \nbetween counsel and members of the class. \n26. This  action,  in part,  seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As  such, the \nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the PPS.  In short, the \nPPS and the Policy Making Defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to all class \nmembers. \n27. In  addition  to  certification  under  Rule  23(b )(2),  and  the  alternative, \n1ll \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n28. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants' written and/or de Jacto policy of strip \nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to \nthe PPS is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution, and whether such a written and/or de Jacto policy existed during the class \nperiod. \n29. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \n9 \n\ndispersed  over a  large  geographical  area.  Furthermore,  the  expense  and burden  of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass to  redress  the  wrongs  done  to  them.  The  cost to  the  federal  court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also  magnify the  delay and expense to  all parties and the  court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n30. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the past \n10 years with the practice being declared unconstitutional. \n31. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4 ). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n32. The  Fourth  Amendment  of the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers  they  supervise,  from  performing  strip  searches  of arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes unless the Corrections Officer has \nreasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n33. Upon information and belief, the City of Philadelphia, PPS and the Policy \nMaking Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of \n10 \n\nstrip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the PPS and are placed into jail \nclothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the presence of \nreasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  individual  was  concealing  a  weapon  or \ncontraband. \n34. Upon information and belief, the City of Philadelphia, PPS and the Policy \nMaking Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of \nconducting  visual  body  cavity  searches  (visual  inspection  of the  vaginal  and  rectal \ncavities) and strip searches (involving the removal of clothing for a visual inspection) on \nall individuals who enter their custody, regardless of the individual characteristics or the \nnature of their charged crime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity \nsearches are collectively referred to as \"strip searches.\" \n35. The City of Philadelphia, the PPS and the Policy Making Defendants know \nthat they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy or practice of \nconducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion.  This Court and \nthe Federal Courts of Appeal have stated repeatedly that state officials may not strip \nsearch  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent  particularized, \nreasonable suspicion. \n36. The  Defendants'  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n11 \n\n37. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n38. Upon information and belief, the City of Philadelphia, PPS and Policy Making \nDefendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written \nand/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all individuals placed into the \ncustody of the PPS and placed into jail clothing without any requirement of reasonable \nsuspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the \nstrip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the \ncharacteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to \nthe enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches. \n39. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding every named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Philadelphia Prison System.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into \nor establishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable \nsuspicion.  Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n40. As  a  direct  and proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to this written and/or defacto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches \neach member of the class, including every named Plaintiff - has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n12 \n\nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n37.  Ms. Boone's experience is representative.  On or about October 22, 2004 at \napproximately  6:30  PM,  Plaintiff Nakisha  Boone  was  arrested  on  a  bench  warrant \nrelative to a criminal charge originally prosecuted against her in 1998.  The charge in \nquestion, endangering the welfare of a child, is a first degree misdemeanor under 18 \nP.C.S.A.  ยง 4304.  Ms.  Boone's arrest  occurred  after  she  was  stopped  for  a  traffic \nviolation.  The circumstances of her criminal chares are that she is alleged to have left her \nchildren alone, thereby endangering their welfare.  The misdemeanor criminal charges \npending against her were later dismissed. \n38.  The  following  morning,  Ms.  Boone  was  transported  to  the  Riverside \nCorrectional Facility, a component facility of the Philadelphia Prison System, and was \nbooked into the facility.  Approximately 24 hours later, Ms. Boone was moved into a \nroom in the booking area of RCF and ordered to remove her clothing.  Ms. Boone was \nthen instructed to \"squat and cough,\" and then to bend over and spread the lobes of her \nbuttocks to allow for a visual examination of her vagina and anus.  Ms. Boone was then \nprovided with a jail uniform. \n39. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMs. Boone was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made \nof Ms. Boone that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion necessary to \nconduct a strip search. \n42.  As  a  direct  and proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search conducted \npursuant to  the  Defendants'  policy,  practice  and  custom,  Plaintiff has  suffered  and \ncontinues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n13 \n\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law --\n43.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference  and reallege  each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 42. \n44.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers,  and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n45. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for the City of \nPhiladelphia,  PPS  and the  Individual  Defendants  to  strip  search  Plaintiffs  and  class \nmembers based on their arrests  for  misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was  also not \nobjectively  reasonable  for  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  to  order/direct  officers  to \nconduct such searches. \n46. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the  City  of Philadelphia,  PPS  and  individual  defendants.  As  such,  the  City  of \nPhiladelphia is directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the \nClass. \n47.  Upon  information  and  belief,  City  of Philadelphia,  PPS  and  individual \ndefendants are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in \n14 \n\nthe operation of the PPS, and are responsible for the implementation of the strip search \npolicy  questioned  in  this  lawsuit.  As  such,  the  Individual  Defendants  are  each \nindividually responsible  for  the damages of the  named Plaintiff and members of the \nClass. \n48.  The  Individual  Defendants knew that  the  strip  search policy,  practice  or \ncustom was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive \nPlaintiffs and members of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n49.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n50. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured. \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n51.  Plaintiffs  incorporate by reference  and reallege  each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 50. \n52.  The policy, custom and practice of the City of Philadelphia, PPS  and the \nPolicy  Making  Defendants  is  clearly  unconstitutional,  in  that  these  entities  and \nindividuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the \nPPS  without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons. \n53. Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Philadelphia, PPS \nand individual defendants to be unconstitutional. \n15 \n\nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n--Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction--\n54.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs I through 53. \n55. The policy, custom and practice of the City of Philadelphia, PPS and the \nPolicy  Making  Defendants  is  clearly  unconstitutional,  in  that  these  entities  and \nindividuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the \nPPS  without any particularized suspicion that the  individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons. \n56. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the PPS, with \nnew and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have \nalready been inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs. \n57.  The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n58.  Plaintiff demands that the City of Philadelphia, PPS, the Policy Making \nDefendants immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of \nthe Philadelphia Prison System absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction from this Court ordering as much. \n16 \n\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n59. The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n60. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants have no respect for the civil \nrights of individual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive \ndamages is necessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to \nthem that the requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government \nofficials in the City of Philadelphia. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n61.  The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Nakisha Boone, on behalf of herself and on behalf of a \nclass  of others  similarly  situated,  requests  that  this  Honorable  Court  grant  her  the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiff's First \nCause of Action detailed herein, awarding Compensatory and Punitive Damages to the \nnamed Plaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by \na Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis. \n17 \n\nC.  A  declaratory  judgment  against  all  Defendants  declaring  the  City  of \nPhiladelphia and the PPS' policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity searching \nall  detainees  entering  the  system,  regardless  of the  crime  charged  or  suspicion  of \ncontraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nD.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enJommg  Defendants  from \ncontinuing to strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \nE.

Th ese searches could not be more degrading.   \nAll members of the proposed class are requir ed to disrobe in front of a Corrections \nOfficer, and are then required to bend or m anipulate themselves to allow for a v isual \ninspection of the genitals and body cavities.  Under the Cityโs written strip search policy, \nthese searches are to be done  with a Corrections Officer usi ng a flashlight to illuminate \nbody cavities.  These searches  are done on everyone entering  the Prison System.  Men, \nwomen, juveniles, the elderl y, the sick, the m entally and physically handicapped, the \nobese ---- many of whom are ch arged with minor crimes like driving while intoxicated, \nshoplifting, and failing to pay fines.  One cour t has fairly describ ed these searches as \nbeing  โdemeaning,  dehumanizing,  undignified,  humiliating,  terrifying, unpleasant,  \nembarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.โ  Mary Beth G. v. City \nof Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).     \nThere is no factual disp ute that these searches occurred in the past โ in  fact, the \nCity is even boastful about the supposed need to do this to everybody.  They have refused \nto  change their policies in the face of th is  lawsuit, m eaning  as this m otion,  and a \nprospective motion for prelim inary injunction, is pending, thousands of people will be \nillegally strip searched by th e Philadelphia Prison System .  Other federal courts, when \nfaced with the same situation, have not hesitated to certify a class action to address illegal \nuniform strip search policies, and they also  have not hesitated to  enter injunctions to \nprotect  the  constitutional  rights  of pre-trial detainees.   See,  Marriott  v. Cou nty  of \n  1\n\nMontgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y.), affโd, 2005 WL 3117194 (2d Cir. 2005) (class \ncertification, preliminary injunction in strip search class action);  Marriott v. County of  \nMontgomery, 426 F. Supp.2d 1 (N.D.N.Y. 2006) (summ ary judgment and permanent \ninjunction in favor of a certified class).   The present case before the Court mandates \ntreatment as a class action so that the City  can be held accountable for its intentional \nviolation of the constitutional rights of tens of thousands of individuals, many of whom, \nbecause of their circumstances, have no voice to individually seek change or recompense \nfrom a large government agency.   The Plaintiffs respectfully seek class certification by \nthe filing of this motion.   \nI.  Procedural History \n  Nakisha Boone initiated this putative class action against the City of Philadelphia \n(the โCity), the Philadelphia Prison Service (โPPSโ), and various individual defendants \non April 21, 2005 with the filing of a class  action complaint.  Motions for summary \njudgment were filed by Ms. Boone and th e City on January 23, 2006 and February 23, \n2006, respectively.  After the m otions were fully briefed, the parties entered into a  \nstipulation  dismissing  PPS and the individu al  defendants from   the lawsuit.  The \nstipulation was approved by the Court on  May 17, 2006, and the City rem ains the only \nnamed defendant in this case.  On June 8, 2006, the Court entered an order denying both \nmotions for summary judgment without prejudice.  The Court  advised the parties that it \nwould  consider renewed m otions  for summ ary  judgment  after the issue of class  \ncertification had been resolved.  Contemporaneously with this motion the Plaintiffs have \nsought leave to intervene George Byrd as a class representative. \n  2\n\n  In accordance with orders issued throughout the course of this litigation, Plaintiff \nsubmits this motion seeking that the Court  certify a class of individuals who, like Ms. \nBoone and Mr. Byrd, have had their civil ri ghts unnecessarily violated by the unifor m \nstrip search practices of the City.  In a separate motion proceeding that the Plaintiffs hope \nwill be heard contem poraneously with this motion, proposed class cou nsel also seek a \npreliminary injunction barring the City from continuing to illegally strip search pretrial \ndetainees admitted to the custody of PPS absent reasonable suspicion.   \nII.  Factual Background  \n  A.  Nakisha Booneโs Arrest and Strip Search \nNakisha Boone is a single mother who works as an aide in a nursing hom e.  (Ex. \nA, Boone Aff., ยถ3).  On October 22,  2004, Ms. Boone was arrested for failing to appear \nto answer charges of reckless endangerm ent (Pa. C.S.A. Crimes and Offenses ยง2705 โ \nmisdemeanor in the second degree) and endang ering the welfare of a child (Pa. C.S.A. \nCrimes and Offenses ยง4304 misdemeanor in the first degree), both misdemeanors under \nPennsylvaniaโs Criminal Code.  (B oone Aff., ยถ1; Ex. B, Boone Arrest and Booking \nDocuments).    \n  The underlying charges in question occurred in 2001, with Ms. Boone failing to  \nappear  to  answer th ese  charges  until  the ti me  of her arrest seve ral  years  later.   A \nPhiladelphia Police Officer pulled over Ms. Boone on October 22, 2004 for having an \nexpired registration, and during  the traffic stop the officer di scovered that Plaintiff was \nthe subject of an outstanding  bench warrant.  (Boone Aff.  at ยถ6; Ex. A, March 22, 2006 \nStipulation, at ยถ2; Ex. D, Boone De p. at 76-77).  The following day, after being ordered \nheld on $5,000 bail, Ms. Boone was transported to Riverside, a component facility of PPS \n  3\n\nthat is responsible for the in take of new fe male detainees.  (Boone A ff. at ยถ7; E x. C \nMarch 22, 2006 Stipulation, at ยถ3; Boone Dep. at  80).  Shortly after her arrival at the \nfacility, Ms. Boone was m oved into a shower  room and ordered to remove all of her \nclothing, including her underpants and brassier e.  (Boone Aff. at ยถ8; Boone Dep. at 83, \n86). While naked, Ms. Boone was instructed to  โsquat and cough,โ and then to bend at \nthe waist and spread the lobes of her buttocks to allow for a visual inspection of her \nvaginal and anal cavities.  (Boone Aff. at  ยถ8; Boone Dep. at 89).  Ms. Boone was forced \nto โsquatโ so a Corrections Officer could see if any contraband dislodged from her vagina \nor anus.1   \n  The strip search of Ms. Boone was conduc ted regardless of the fact that she was  \ndetained on a bench w arrant for two m isdemeanor charges, and without any reason to \nbelieve that she was concealing weapons or contraband in her private areas.  There is no \nreason to believe that Ms. B oone, arrested while driving in  Philadelphia after a traf fic \nstop for a bench warrant on thre e year old misdemeanor charges, was in possession of \nany weapons or contraband.  The strip and visual cavity search of Ms. Boone revealed no \nsuch items.  (Boone Dep. at 90).  Moreover, the reason why Ms. Boone was subjected to \nthis humiliating procedure is simple:  as illustrated below, the City of Philadelphia admits \nto  doing this to everybody, re gardless  of crim inal  charges,  reasonable suspicion, or \npersonal characteristics, upon their admission to the PPS.  \nB.  Proposed Intervenor George Byrdโs Arrest and Strip Search \nOn  March 31, 2005, proposed intervenor George Byrd was arrested at 3900 \nWissahickon  Avenue, Philadelphia, for opera ting  a m otor  vehicle w ith  a suspended \n                                                 \n1 Several weeks later, Ms.  Booneโs underlying criminal charges were dismissed by the Philadelphia \nMunicipal Court, and she was released from custody.  (Boone Aff. at ยถ3). \n \n  4\n\noperatorโs license while under the influence of  alcohol.  Since Mr. Byrd had failed to \nappear for a hearing relating  to a prior arrest for driving under the influence, Mr. B yrd \nwas taken to the police station under a bench warrant.   \nOn April 2, 2005, Mr. Byrd was arraigne d and bail was set at $2,500.  He was \nunable to make bail at the tim e and was th en transferred to the P hiladelphia Prison \nSystem.  During the intake pr ocedures at the Philadelphia Prison System, Mr. Byrd was \nrequired to undergo a strip searc h, including a visual cavity s earch.  This search did not \nreveal any contraband on Mr.  Byrdโs person.  At no time in Mr. Byrdโs criminal history \nhad he been charged with a fe lony, drug offenses or weapons charges.  This strip search \nwas undertaken without any reasonable suspic ion pursuant to defendantโs uniform strip \nsearch policy.  Mr. Byrd was discharged fr om Philadelphia Prison System after making \nbail on April 3, 2005.  Mr. Byrdโs  charges were eventually  dismissed.  (See, Proposed \nAmended Complaint ยถยถ 35). \nC.  The City of Philadelphiaโs Unequivocal Admission to Conducting \nBlanket Strip Searches at PPS \n \n  Individuals sent to PPS are the subject of a detainer, and that detainer is reviewed \nfor  propriety on adm ission.   (Ex. E, DiNubi le  Dep. at 59).  Neither the detainer \npaperwork nor any other pertinent infor mation about the detainee is forwarded to the \nsearch officer, the individual who administers the strip searches in question in a series of \nshower rooms.  (DiNubile Dep., at 79, 90).   Likewise, the process officer (who enters a \ndetaineeโs information into a com puter right before they are strip searched) does not \nattempt to ascertain the past criminal history of the detainee.  (DiNubile Dep. at 107-08, \n111-12, 114-17). \n  5\n\nIt is undisputed that the  City of Philadelphia conducts  blanket strip and visual \ncavity searches on all new detainees admitted to the PPS.  As  an  initial  matter,  the \nwritten policies of the PPS require these blanket searches. Policy number 3.A.18 of PPS, \nentitled  โSearches,โ details the standard  procedure  of PPS regarding strip searches,  \nincluding searches performed when an individual initially enters a PPS facility.  (Ex. E-1, \nCity of Philadelphia Strip Search Policy).  The written se arch policy clearly states that \nโInmates are routinely strip s earched on the following occasions:  at intakeโฆ,โ (Search \nPolicy, p. 6), and in its def initional section describes these searches as โthe removal and \nsearching of all clothing and visual inspection of the unc lothed bodyโ to be conducted \nโduring routine searches as indicated in this policy.โ  (Sea rch Policy, p. 2).  The Search \nPolicy states: \n[m]ale and female inmates will be required to bend over and squat \ndown, using his/her hands to expose  the anus and genitalia.  The \nfollowing  procedures will be perfor med  in conducting a strip  \nsearch:โฆ [A Corrections Officer will] visually inspect the naked \nbody for the presence of contraband from  head to foot, including \nflashlight inspection of the mouth and ears and an external view of \nthe anus and genitalia while th e inmate uses his/her body and \nhands to expose those areas to view.   \n \n(Search Policy, p.6).  The policy further provides, as an example for โspecific situations,โ \nthat โeach inmate will be โstrip searchedโ by an intake officer of the same gender in a \nprivate area as part of the adm ission process and prior to housing on the intake housing \nunit.โ  (Search Policy, p. 8).  In sho rt, the Search Policy, by its express term s, requires \nโroutine,โ  blanket  strip  searches to be  conducted  on ev ery  person adm itted  to  the \nPhiladelphia Prison System, regardless of crim inal charge or individualized reasonable \nsuspicion. \n  6\n\n  Major James DiNubile, Defendantโs 30(b)(6) designee and a Deputy Warden of \nthe Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility (โCFCFโ) (the fac ility where male pretrial \ndetainees such as George Byrd are processed into the PP S), freely admitted that all \npretrial detainees including juveniles committed to the PPS are subjected to a strip and \nvisual cavity search upon their admission to PPS facilities.  (D iNubile Dep., pp. 65-66, \n82-93). \n  Major  DiNubile  testified  that th e  Philadelphia  Prison  System  processes \napproximately 30,000 individuals per year for de tention in PPS facilities, more than half \nof which are pretrial detainees who could not make bail after being arraigned.  (DiNubile \nDep., pp. 22, 29-31).2  DiNubile also stated that the Philadelphia Prison System detains \nindividuals  charged with al l  manner  of crim es,  including m isdemeanors,  summary \noffenses, probation violations, parole violati ons, Family Court Act violations, failing to \npay fines, as well as those held on bench  warrants.  (DiNubile, pp. 32-43).  DiNubile \naffirmed that the actu al strip search pract ices of the Philadelphia Pris on System are \nreflected in the written Search Policy, that  men and women are treated identically with \nthe exception of the location in which they  are strip searched  (women are booked and \nstrip searched at the Riverside Correction al Facility), and that women are forced to life \ntheir breasts and โsquat and coughโ during their search while men are required to lift their \ntesticles.  (DiNubile, pp. 20-21, 141-148).  Men are also required to bend at the waist and \nphysically spread the lobes of their buttock s.  (DiNubile, pp. 145-46).  These searches \nuniformly involve the visual inspection of body cavities (the vagina and anus) of each \nand every detainee admitted to the PPS, regardless of reasonable suspicion, crim inal \n                                                 \n2 The City also provide d booking information for all detainees adm itted to PPS  during much of the \nproposed class period.  These records number into the tens of thousands.  \n  7\n\ncharge, or individual circumstances.  The searches of m en occur in a 6 โ by 10โ shower \nstall, with the Corrections Officer standing in close proximity to the detainee.  (DiNubile \nDep. pp. 80-81).  The searches of fem ale detainees occur under similar circumstances.  \n(Boone Dep. pp. 88-90; Ex.F, Harold Dep., pp. 88-96, 98-104; Ex. G, Singleton Dep., 38, \n68).    \n  The following exchange best summarizes DiNubileโs testimony about the City of \nPhiladelphiaโs uniform strip search policies: \nQuestion [by Attorney Keach]:  I just want to clarify for the record.  Every \nindividual who comes into the Philadelphia Prison System is subjected to \na strip search as part of the reception procedure, correct? \n \nAnswer [by Major DiNubile]:  Part of the reception proces s, yes, that is \ncorrect. \n \nQuestion:   And that strip search  involves  that individual com pletely \ndisrobing, including removing his underpants, correct? \n \n    Answer:  That is correct. \n \nQuestion:  That pro cedure also involves a visual examination of, for a \nmale, their rectum, correct? \n \n    Answer:  Thatโs correct. \n \nQuestion:  For a female inmate that would involve a visual examination to \nsee when they squat if anything falls  from the vagina or the rectum, \ncorrect? \n \n    Answer:  Thatโs correct. \n \nQuestion:  Is reasonable suspicion considered at all when conducting those \nstrip searches? \n \n    Answer:  The strip searches on intake? \n \n    Question:  On intake. \n \n    Answer:  No, itโs a part of the process. \n \n  8\n\n    Question:  Are criminal charges considered on intake? \n \n   Answer:   No. \n \nQuestion:   Is an inm ateโs  past  criminal  history considered when that \nindividual is strip searched on intake? \n \n   Answer:   No. \n \nQuestion:  Is an individualโs status  as either being a pretrial hold or a \nconvicted inmate considered when being strip searched on intake? \n \n   Answer:   No. \n \nQuestion:  Is it fair to say, sir, that the strip search on intake, that has been \nthe subject of your testimony here toda y, is conducted on a uniform basis \non all individuals admitted to the Philadelphia Prison System? \n \n   Answer:   Yes. \n(DiNubile  Dep., pp. 178-80).  In short, eac h  and every individual adm itted  to the \nPhiladelphia  Prison System   is forced to  undergo  a strip searc h,  including a visual \nexamination of their body cavities.   \n  In their prior briefing before the Court,  the City m aintained that Ms. Booneโs \nโhistory of violenceโ justified their strip search of her.  Presum ably, no matter who the \nPlaintiffs present to the Court, the Defendants will find some post hoc marginal basis to \njustify the strip search of that particular individual.  The actual practices of the City and \nits Corrections Officers, of course, de monstrate that no effort is made to determine \nsomeoneโs  history before sear ching  them.   As part of   discovery in   this action ,  the \nDefendants produced documents reflecting the Corrections Officers on duty during Ms. \nBooneโs admission and search at the Riversid e Correctional Facility.  This โAdm issions \nReportโ reflects that Officers Harold, Singelton, and Bryant were working at the time of \nMs. Booneโs admission, (Ex Y., RCF Admissions Report), and each of these Corrections \n  9\n\nOfficers was deposed by the Plaintiffs.  They all confirmed that everyone is subjected to a \nstrip and visual cavity search upon adm ission to PPS regardless of reasonable suspicion \nor criminal charge, that the practice continues until today, and that no effort is made to \ndetermine the background of those being  searched.  (Singleton Dep., pp. 38-42, 57-58, \n68-69; Harold Dep., pp. 99-102, 123-24, 109-111;  Ex. H, Sareem Bryant Dep., pp. 17-\n19).  All of these City Corrections Officers also confirmed that they had no knowledge or \nrecollection of Nakisha Boone.   (Singlet on Dep., pp. 60-63; Harold Dep., pp. 123).  To \nthe extent that Ms. Booneโs โhistory of violenceโ justifies her strip search on October 23, \n2004, the officers that conducted the search apparently know nothing about it.  \nD.  The Illegality of the Cityโs Blanket Strip Search Policy \nThe legality of the Cityโs strip search regimen was the subject of prior m otion \nproceedings before the Court.  While the Court declined to decide the Plaintiffโs Motion \nfor Partial Summary Judgment because of factua l disputes, the Plain tiffs maintain that \nthey have demonstrated to the Court the patent illegality of the Cityโs strip search policy.  \nSee, Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F. Supp. 772, 789-90 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (โwe are com pelled to \nfind that ensuring the security  needs of the Schuylkill C ounty Prison by strip searching \nplaintiffs was unreasonable without a partic ularized suspicion by th e authorities that \neither of the twin dangers of concea ling weapons or contraband existedโ).   See also, \nDelandro v. County of Allegheny,  No. 06-0927 (TFM/RCM) (W .D. Pa. December 7, \n2006) (unreported), affโd by order, No. 06-0927 (W.D. Pa. January 8, 2007) (considering \nthe blanket strip search practice of the Allegheny County Jail) (Exhibit X).  The Plaintiffs \nalso maintain that they successfully  defeated the justification provided by the City  for \nthese  searches, including Cityโs supposed โhuge problem โ  with contraband (seven \n  10\n\nincidents in approximately 70,000 admissions), the need to conduct such searches to keep \ncontraband out the Philadelphia Prison System, and the claim that reasonable suspicion to \nstrip search an individual can be manufactured after the fact.  See, Ford v. City of Boston, \n154 F. Supp.2d 131, 137 (D. Mass. 2001) (contraba nd discovered โfive times,โ or 0.063 \npercent of the time, during admissions to Suffolk County Jail);  John Does No. 1-100 v. \nBoyd, 613 F. Supp. 1514, 1523 (D. Minn. 1985) (discu ssing the โunplannedโ nature of \nbeing  arrest,  and how uniform   strip search es  โcan hardly be exp ected  to d eter \nsmugglingโ); Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, 141 F. Supp.2d 304, 309 (N.D.N.Y. 2001) \n(calling  the  post  hoc  effort  to pro vide  reasonable  suspicion  to jus tify  uniform  strip \nsearches โabsurdโ).  These issues, of  course, are the common legal questions that m ake \nthis action suitable for class certification. \nIII.  The Court Should Certify This Action, Either on a Full or Partial Basis, as a \nClass Action \n \nNakisha Boone and, with the Courtโs approval, proposed intervenor George Byrd, \nseek to represent a class  of thousands of individuals, many of whom  are poor and \ndisenfranchised, who had, and who will hav e, their civil rights unnecessarily violated by \nthe uniform strip search practices of the City of Philadelphia.  The class that Plaintiffs \nseek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll  persons  who have been or will b e  placed  into th e \ncustody  of the Philadelphia Prison System after being \ncharged with misdemeanors, summary offenses, violations \nof  probation or parole, tr affic  infractions,  civil \ncommitments, or other minor crimes, and who were or will \nbe  strip searched upon their entry into the P hiladelphia \nPrison System pursuant to the policy, custom  and practice \nof  the Philadelphia P rison  System  and the City of  \nPhiladelphia.  The class period commences on April 21, \n2003 and extends to th e present or until the d efendant is \nenjoined  from,  or otherwise ceases, enforcing the \n  11\n\nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting \nstrip  searches absent reasona ble  suspicion.   Specifically \nexcluded  from  the clas s  are any and all of the City of \nPhiladelphiaโs  affiliates,  legal r epresentatives,  heirs, \nsuccessors, or assignees.  Also excluded from the class are \nany and all employees of the Philadelphia Prison System. \n \n \nThe Court may certify a case for class act ion treatment where a plaintiff can \ndemonstrate  that the threshold requirem ents  of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) (num erosity, \ncommonality,  typicality and adequacy of  representation)  are satisfied, and   also \ndemonstrate that the class satisfies one of th e three criteria set fo rth in Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b).  See Amechem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613-14 (1997);  Baby Neal v. \nCasey,  43 F.3d 46, 55-56 (3d Cir. 1994).  Here,  the  proposed class satisfies these \nthreshold requirements, and the Plaintiffs reque st that the Court certify this action as a \nmoney  damages  class under Fed. R. Civ. P 23(b )(3),  or, in the a lternative,  as an \ninjunctive  relief class action under Rule 23(b)(2 ).   Should the Court find that full \ncertification is inappropriate, Plaintiffs request partial certification relative to the issues \ncommon to the class: the existence of a blanket strip search policy at Philadelphia Prison \nSystem facilities, and the liability of the City of Philadelphia for that policy.  \nThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit  has held that the \"interests of justice \nrequire that in a doubtful case ... an y error, if there is to be one, should be comm itted in \nfavor of allowing a class action.\" Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 785 (3d Cir. 1985), \ncert. denied, 474 U.S. 946 (1985); In re Bulk (Extruded) Graphite Prods. Antitrust Litig. \nSlip Copy, 2006 WL 891362, *4 (D.N.J. 2006) (โinterest s of justice require that in a \ndoubtful caseโฆ any error, if there is to be one, should be committed in favor of allowing \n  12\n\na class action.โ) (Ex. L). See e.g. Hairston v. Hutzler, 334 F. Supp. 251, 254(W .D. Pa. \n1971) affโd 468 F.2d 621 (3d Cir. 1972). \nโThe Courtโs focus in deciding a m otion under Rule 23 is on whether a class \naction is an appropriate vehicle for litigat[ing] the claims alleged, and not the merits of \nthe case.โ  Bart Dal Ponte v. American Mortgage Express Corp ., 2006 WL 2403982, *2 \n(D.N.J. Aug. 17, 2006) (citing Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178 (1974); \nIn re Chiang, 385 F.3d 256, 269-270(3d Cir. 2004)).   As opposed to considering the \nmerits of the underlying claim , the Court should consider โwhether the requirem ents of \nRule 23 are met.โ  In Re Visa Check/Master Money Antitrust Litig.,  280 F.3d 124, 133 \n(2d Cir. 2001). โ[T]he legal standard is  whether the evidence presented by plaintiffs \nestablishes a reasonable basis for crediting plaintiffsโ assertions.โ   Bynum v. District of \nColumbia, 214 F.R.D. 27, 31 (D.D.C. 2003) (q uotations omitted).  โ[P]laintiffs need not \nestablish  the merits  of  their case a t  the  class  certification  stage and the substan tive \nallegations of the com plaint must be taken as true, [though] the  court must conduct a \nrigorous analysis to determ ine the suitability of resolving the issues in a class action.โ   \nBlain v. Smithkline Beecham Corp ., 2007 WL 178564, *3-4 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 25, 2007) \n(internal citations omitted) (Ex. N).  While it is not necessary for a class representative to \nmake  an extensiv e  evidentiary  showing  for  evaluating w hether  class  certification  is \nproper, see In re Chiang, 385 F.3d 256, 269-270 (3d Cir. 2004), as demonstrated herein, \nPlaintiff has done so in this case by provi ding the Court with written documentation and \ndeposition testimony confirming the allegations of the Amended Class Action Complaint.   \nIn the instant case the Cityโs 30(b)(6) designee and four Philadelphia Prison \nSystem correctional officers each unequivocally testified that a blanket strip search policy \n  13\n\nis in place at PPS facilities.   Correctional Officer Harold testified that strip searches are \nperformed  on all detainees who enter the Ph iladelphia  Prison  System, regardless of \ncriminal charge and regardless of whether or  not any suspicion exists to believe that a \ndetainee is carrying contraba nd.  (Harold Dep., pp. 109-1 10).  Correctional Officers \nSingleton and Bryant confirmed that, without exception, every single individual admitted \nto a PPS facility is subjected to a strip search.  (Singleton Dep., p. 57; Bryant Dep., p. 17-\n18).  According to Officer Singleton, strip searches are employed in a non-discriminatory \nmanner:  โNo exception.  No discrimination to race, weight, height, repeat offender, new \nadmit, the first time come in, thereโs no discrimination.โ  (Singleton Dep. p. 58).  As s et \nforth  in greater below, other federal cour ts,  in conside ring  the situation wher e  a \nmunicipality employs a blanket strip search  policy, have not hesitated to certify those \nactions as class actions.12     \nA.  The Proposed Class Satisfies th e Numerosity Requirement of Rule \n23(a)(1) \n \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be โso numerous that joinder of all members \nis impracticable.โ  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1); Stewart v.

By modern, complex litigation standards the minimum number of parties is \nnot large.โ   In re Mercedes-Benz Antitrust Litig., 213 F.R.D. 180, 185 (D.N.J. 2003).   \nโNo  definite standard exists concerning  a  magic num ber  satisfying  the num erosity \nrequirement, nor must plaintiff allege the exact number or identity of class membersโฆ It \nis proper for the court to accept common sense assumptions in order to support a finding \nof numerosity.โ  Cumberland Farms, Inc. v. Browning-Ferris Indus. , 120 F.R.D. 642, \n645-646 (E.D. Pa. 1988) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   \nThe element of numerosity is clearly met here.  The Third Circuit has previously \ninstructed that โ[n]o  minimum number of plaintiffs is required to maintain a suit as a \nclass action, but generally if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of \nplaintiffs exceeds 40, the first prong of Rule 23(a) has been met.โ  Stewart v. Abraham, \n275 F.3d at 226-27.  Here, where the booking records produced by the City confirm that \ntens of thousands of individuals were arre sted and detained in PPS facilities during th e \nclass period, the num erosity requirement for certification is easily satisfied.   See e.g. \nBowers v. City of Philadelphia , 2006 WL 2818501, *2-3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 28, 2006) \n(numerosity  exists where over 300 indivi duals  had allegedly been subjected to \nunconstitutional  conditions at PPS   facilities  and where the  proposed class, w hich \nincludes future detainees, could include thousands of people) (Ex. R); Marriott v. County \nof Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159, 171 (N.D.N.Y.),  affโd, 2005 WL 3117194 (2d Cir. \n2005) (finding numerosity in strip search  class action where proposed class num bered \nover 2,000 individuals). \n  15\n\nB.  There  are Numerous Questions of Law   and Fact Common to the \nClass. \n \n  Rule 23(a)(2) requires that there b e โquestions of law or fact comm on to the \nclass.โ  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2).  The comm onality requirement is m et if the plaintiffโs \ngrievances  โshare at least one question of  fact  or law   with the grievan ces  of  the \nprospective class.  Because the requirement may be satisfied by a single common issue, it \nis easily metโฆโ  Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994).  A party is entitled to \ncertification where the class  claims arise โfrom a โcommon nucleus of operative factโ \nregardless of whether the underlying facts fluctuate over the cl ass period and vary as to \nindividual claimants.โ  In re Asbestos Sch. Litig., 104 F.R.D. 422, 429 (E.D. Pa. 1983).  A \nsingle common question is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).  See H. \nNewberg & A. Conte , 1 Newberg on Class Actions s3.10, at 3-50(1992);  accord Baby \nNeal, 43 F.3d at 56.   \nโThis low bar recognizes that, even where factual differences m ay exist between \nputative class members, the class action may be a useful method of resolving those issues \nthat are common to them all.โ   In re Hydrogen Peroxid e Antitrust Litig., 2007 WL \n163767, *2 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 19, 2007) (Ex. S).  In addressing the issues of commonality and \npredominance, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circ uit in Hassine v. \nJeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 177 (3d Cir. 1988) explained that โRule 23 does not require that the \nrepresentative plaintiff have endured precisely the same injuries that have been sustained \nby the class members, only that the harm complained of be common to the class.โ  Thus, \nPlaintiffs are not required to show that a ll class membersโ claims are identical to one \nanother.   Differences between proposed clas s  members,  โwhile arguably  relevant as \ndefenses to liability, do not change the fact  that this class action raises the same basic \n  16\n\nclaim  and shares com mon  questions of law.โ   Mack,  191  F.R.D. at 23 (allowing \ncertification of strip search class action desp ite โvarying defenses to liability which may \nbe raised regarding particular individualsโ).   \nThe Plaintiffs have established commonality in this case.  The heart of Ms. Boone \nand proposed intervenor George Byrdโs claim s against the City of  Philadelphia is that \nboth they and the members of the proposed class were illegally strip searched upon their \nentry into PPS facilities, pursuant to a uniform policy, custom and practice implemented \nby  the City .   The City   of  Philadelphia  admits  that a ll  individuals  admitted  to  PPS \nfacilities were, and continue to be, subjected to the visual inspection of their naked bodies \nupon admission.  The testimony of three Corrections Officers, all of whom were working \nat the time that Plaintiff Nakisha Boone was strip  searched, have confirmed this uniform \npractice.  Plaintiff Nakisha Boone testified that she was subjected to this procedure on her \nadmission to the Riverside Correctional Facility.  (Boone Dep. at 83-39).  When George \nByrd  is de posed,  he will conf irm  this as well re lative  to th e  Curran-Fromhold \nCorrectional Facility.  As such, this class  action has three common i ssues that are of \ncentral importance to all class members: a) did the City of Philadelphia employ a blanket \nstrip search policy and/or practice during the class period; b) does the Cityโs blanket strip \nsearch  policy  violate the unreasonable s earch  provisions of the United S tates \nConstitution;  and c)   is the   City  of  Philadelphia  directly  responsible  for  these \nconstitutional violations?  Obviously, the Plaintiffs believe  that, at the appropriate time, \nall of these issues will be resolved in their favor on summary judgment.   \nUnder  circumstances  such  as  these,  where  all class m embers  raise comm on \nquestions of law and assert the same claims a result of an unlawful strip search policy, the \n  17\n\nelement of commonality ha s been established.  See Dodge v. County of Orange , 226 \nF.R.D. 177, 180-181 (S .D.N.Y. 2005) (commonality exists where all mem bers of the \nclass contend that a blanket strip search policy exists, where all members contend that the \npolicy is illegal, and where all members of the class claim they were searched pursuant to \nthe policy which was unif ormly applied to a ll detainees); Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172 \n(finding commonality where the representative parties and the members of the proposed \nclass had the same legal claims based upon the same official procedure); see also Sutton \nv. Hopkins County,  2007 WL 119892, *4 ( W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, 2007) ( โPlaintiffs have \nalleged that the Defendants ha d a policy, custom, or practice of strip-searching persons \non admission to and/or just prior to release  from the Hopkins County Jail without regard \nto whether there existed the requisite individual, reasonable suspicion required by law. \nGiven this allegation, the existence and constitutionality of the county's policy, custom or \npractice are common questions.โ) (Ex. T).  This point was recently clarified by this Court \nin Bowers v. City of Philadelphia, 2006 WL 281850, *2-3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 28, 2006).  In \nBowers, pretrial detainees in  the custody of the Philadel phia Prison System brought a \nclass  action alleging severe overcrowdi ng  and dangerous, unhealthy and degrading \nconditions.  Judge Surrick granted the plaintiffsโ motion for class certification, noting that \ncommonality had been established where โall class members are or will be subjected to \nthe conditions allegedโฆ, all of which result f rom the overall claim of unconstitutional \novercrowdingโ and where โall m embers of the class raise common questions of lawโ  \ninvolving the constitutionality of the PPSโs practices and policies.  Id.  \n  18\n\nIn short, the proposed class  satisfies the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a).  \nThe constitutionality of Defendantsโ policies is at the core of this litigation and would be \nthe focus of any trial in this matter โ whether for an individual or for a class. \nC.  The Claims of the Representative Pl aintiff are Typical of the Claims \nof the Class at Large. \n \n  Rule 23(a)(3) requires that the rep resentative plaintiffโs claims be โtypicalโ of \nthose  of  the other cla ss  members.   Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3 ).   โThe comm onality  and \ntypicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.โ   Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. \nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157, n. 13 (1982).   โThe typicality inquiry centers on whether the \ninterests of the named plaintiffs align with the interests of the absent members.โ  Stewart \nv. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 227 (3d Cir. 2001).  โ[F]actua l differences will not render a  \nclaim atypical if the claim arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct \nthat gives rise to the claim s of the class  members, and if it is based on the same legal \ntheory.โ  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 58; see also Hayworth v. Blondery Robinson & Co., 980 \nF.2d 912, 923 (3d Cir. 1992)(same); Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786, 809-910(3d Cir. \n1984)(โtypicality is demonstrated where the plaintiff can โshow that two issues of law or \nfact he or she shares in common with the class occupy the same degree of centrality to his \nor her claims as to those of unmade class mem bersโ); Blihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 617 \n(applying this principle to a s trip search class action).  A class rep resentative should \nโhave the incentive to prove all of the elem ents of the cause of action which would be \npresented by the individual members of the class were they initiating individual actions.โ  \nDietrich v. Bauer, 192 F.R.D. 119, 124 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).   \n  Here, the claims of Nakisha Boone and  George Byrd are typical of m embers of \nthe proposed class.  They arise from the sam e practices, policies, and course of events, \n  19\n\nand Plaintiffs must make similar arguments to prosecute their claims as would be made \nby members of the proposed class.  See Bowers, 2006 WL 2818501, *2-3 (โA plaintiffโs \nclaim is typical if it arises from the same event or course of conduct that gives rise to the \nclaims of other class members and is based on the same legal theory.โ); see also Weisfeld \nv Sun Chem. Corp. , 210 F.R.D. 136, 140 (D. N.J. 2002) (โ [I]n instances wherein it is \nalleged that the defendants engaged in a common scheme relative to all members of the \nclass there is a strong assum ption that the cl aims of the representa tive parties will be \ntypical of the absent class members.โ)(citation omitted); Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172 \n(finding typicality even where the claim s of the representative parties involved a more \ndetailed search than other class m embers, because they were conducted pursuant to the  \nsame policy); Sutton, 2007 WL 117892, *4 (โBecause each nam ed Plaintiff alleges an \nunconstitutional strip search after arrest for a  minor violation or before release from jail, \nthe claims of the representatives are typical of the class as a whole.โ).  \nThus, typicality is easily satisfied by this proposed class action. \nD.  Nakisha  Boone,  Proposed Intervenor George Byrd, and Their  \nCounsel Will Fairly and Adequately Represent the Class. \n \n  Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the class representative โfairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class.โ  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23( a)(4).   Two separate elem ents  must  be \nestablished in order to satisfy the adequacy of representation test adopted by the Third \nCircuit:  โ(a) the plaintiffโs attorney must be qualified, experienced, and generally able to \nconduct the proposed litigation, and (b) the plai ntiff must not have interests antagonistic \nto those of the class.โ   Wetzel v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 508 F.2d 239, 247 (3d Cir. 1975); \nWeiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786, 811 (3d Cir. 1984).  Notwithstanding the fact that \nboth  prerequisites of adequacy of repres entation  are m et  in this case, any doubts \n  20\n\nconcerning  the adequ acy  of a clas s  representative shou ld  be reso lved  in  favor of \ncertification. See Weikel v. Tower Semiconductor Ltd ., 183 F.R.D. 377, 394 (D.N.J. \n1998).   \n  Nakisha Boone and proposed intervenor Ge orge Byrd seek to bring an end to \nillegal strip searches in the Philadelphia Prison System and are f urther committed to \nobtaining appropriate compensation from Defendants for themselves and for the members \nof the proposed class.  Nakisha Boone and Ge orge Byrd have come forward to represent \nthe class under great personal pressure โ as being subject to a situation as humiliating as a \nstrip search and then being forced to relive  it would be difficult for anyone.  The Cityโs \nefforts to vilify Ms. Boone in their prior moving papers and her deposition underscore the \nscrutiny  faced by som eone  seeking to repr esent  the  claims  of a class agains t  a \nmunicipality.  Plaintiffsโ โinterests in this case coincide with those of the potential class \nmembers in that [Plaintiffs seek] a declaration that the practices, policies, and conditions \ncomplained of in the [Amended Class Action] Complaint are unconstitutional and seek \ninjunctive  relief  prohibiting  the co ntinuation  of  thoseโ polic ies.    Bowers,  2006 W L \n2818501, *6-8. Ms. Boone and Mr. Byrdโs claim s are typical because they arise โfrom \nthe same event or course of conduct that give s rise to the claims of other class members \nand is based on the sam e legal theory.โ   Zeffiro v. First Pa. Banking & Trust C o., 96 \nF.R.D. 567, 569 (E.D. Pa. 1983).   In nearly  identical circumstances and given the \ncommon legal and factual issues, courts have  deemed plaintiffs in sim ilar cases to be \nadequate class representatives.  See e.g.; Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172. \nThe class is also represented by compet ent and experienced counsel w ho have \ninvested considerable time and resources into the prosecution of this action.  (Copies of \n  21\n\nproposed class counsel resum es are attached as Ex. I).  Additionally , counsel in this \naction has served as class counsel in thirteen  strip search class actions, and have been \nheld to be adequate counsel by the United States District Court for the Northern District \nof New York in three certified class actions.  Kahler v. County of Rensselaer, No. 03-CV-\n1324 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (preliminary approval order in strip search class action settlement, \nlitigated by present class couns el; class settlement later granted final approval) (Ex. J); \nMarriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172 , Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 426 F. Supp.2d 1 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2006) (class certificat ion granted by U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of New York, and, by  subsequent decision, summary judgment granted in favor \nof  the cla ss,  class s ettlement  preliminarily  approved);  McDaniel  v. County of \nSchenectady, No. 04-CV-0757 (preliminary approval and certification of settlement class \nin strip search class action, class settlement pending) (Ex. K).    \n  In  short, Nakisha  Boone and Proposed  Intervenor George Byrd are adequate \nrepresentatives  and have reta ined  experienced class cou nsel  that have aggress ively \nlitigated  this  action.  Plain tiffs  have,  accordingly,  satisfied this requirem ent  for \ncertification.   \nE.  Plaintiffs  Have Satis fied  the  Requirements  for a Money Damages  \nClass Under Rule 23(b)(3), as the Common Issues Shared by Class \nMembers Predominate Over Individual Issues and A Class Action is \nthe Superior Method by Which to Prosecute this Case.   \n \nRule 23(b)(3) permits certification when โthe court finds that the questions of law \nor fact common to the m embers of the class p redominate over any questions affectin g \nonly individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for \nthe fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.โ  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). \n  22\n\nThe  party proposing a class action under  Rule  23 must  establish that issues \ncommon to the class predominate over the individual issues of particular class members.  \nSee Amchem, 521 U.S. at 623.  โThe predominance prong is m et when there exists \ngeneralized evidence which proves or disproves an element on a simultaneous, class-wide \nbasis, since such proof obviates the need  to examine each class m ember's individual \nposition.\" Zeno v. Ford Motor Co., 238 F.R.D. 173, 190 (W.D. Pa. 2006).  Although Rule \n23(b)(3) requires that common issues of law and fact predominate, it does not require that \nthere be an absence of any individ ual issues. In re Sugar Industry An titrust Litig., 73 \nF.R.D. 322, 344 (D.C. Pa. 1976).  Neither does satisfaction of the predominance prong of \nthe class certification standard require plaintiffs to provide evidence establishing each \nelement of their cause of action at the class  certification stage.  Rather, it only requires \nplaintiffs to make a threshold showing that each  element of their claim may be proven \nthrough common, class-wide evidence, rather than through evidence particular to each  \nmember of the class. See Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d at 227-228.  The most pragmatic \nway for the Court to make this determination is to evaluate whether โcommon proof will \npredominate at trial.โ   In Re NASDAQ Market Makers, 169 F.R.D. 473, 517 (S.D.N.Y. \n1996);  see  also Jenkins v. Raymark Indus. ,  782 F.2d 468, 472 (5 th  Cir. 1986) (the \nโsignificant aspectโ requirement is met if โjury findings on the clas s question ... will ... \nsignificantly advance the resolution of the underlying ... casesโ);  Dietrich, 192 F.R.D. at \n127 (in determining whether common issues of  fact predominate, โa courtโs inquiry is  \ndirected primarily toward whether the issue of  liability is common to m embers of the \nclassโ).  This is especially true โwhen the class is challenging a uniform policy,โ as โthe \nvalidity of that policy predominates over individual issues.โ Blihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 620. \n  23\n\n  Here, all of the proposed class m embersโ claims revolve around one central legal \nissue: was the policy of strip searching every pretrial detainee admitted to PPS facilities, \nwithout regard to the crime charged or the  circumstances of arrest, constitutional?  The \nproposed class membersโ claims also share common factual issues โ did such a practic e \nexist during the class period, and is the City of Philadelphia responsible for this practice. \nSignificantly, and as set forth in detail a bove, Defendants do not  dispute that the PPS \nimplemented a uniform policy of strip searching every pretrial detainee admitted to its \nfacilities without regard to the existence  of reasonable suspicion.  Clearly, legal and \nfactual issues in this litigation predominate over any potential individual issues.   See e.g. \nMarriott,  227 F.R.D. at 173 (predom inance  found  despite differing facts regarding \npersonal involvement of some individual defendants and slight differences between class \nmembers). \n1.  An Inquiry Into the Existence of Individualiz ed Reasonable \nSuspicion Need Not Enter Into the Courtโs Analysis, and Even \nif it Does, it is Defendantsโ Bu rden to Establish a Justification \nfor the Strip Searches in Question. \n \n  Defendants  may  claim  that the need to analy ze  the exis tence  of reasonable \nsuspicion for each class member is an issue that predominates over any other common \nissues.  This argument fails for two reasons.  First, the metaphysical possibility that some \nof the class members may, at the time of their arrests, have had characteristics that might \nadd up to reasonable suspicion to  conduct a strip search is irre levant to the events that \nroutinely occurred at PPS facilities:  the Class Action Complaint alleges, the City of  \nPhiladelphia admits, and testimony confirms that the Cityโs practice did not (and does \nnot) consider the presence or  absence of reasonable susp icion when conducting strip \nsearches at admission.  The deposition testim ony cited herein confirms that corrections \n  24\n\nofficers did not (and do not) m ake any inquiry whatsoever as to reasonable suspicion \nbefore strip searching an arrestee โ all detainees are strip searched.  Despite the Cityโs \nprior arguments to the Court about Nakisha B ooneโs โhistory of violenceโ justifying her \nstrip search, all Corrections Officers on  duty during her adm ission to the Riverside \nCorrectional Facility testified that they had no recollection of her, and that they did not \nconsider a personโs background prior to strip searching them.  The City cannot claim the \npossibility of facts supporting re asonable suspicion to conduct a strip search if they did \nnot make an inquiry on this point.   See Davis v. City of Camden , 657 F. Supp. 396, 401 \n(D. N.J. 1987) (โ[W]hen an  arrestee charged with a felony  or a misdemeanor involving \nweapons or contraband is strip searched pursuant to a policy encom passing all arrestees, \nregardless of the nature of their offenses,  and where it is conceded th at no suspicion \nregarding  the particular arrestee existed, the  requisite  justification  for  the sea rch  is \nlacking;  neither the general  policy  nor its particular a pplication  is supportable.โ) \n(emphasis in original); Dodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177, 182 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) \n(โIf individualized assessments were in fact not made, then all the searches were illegal, \nbecause each new arrival was constitutionally entitled to an individualized assessment of \nhis or her circum stancesโฆ  [T]he fact that  a particular class m ember could have been \nlawfully strip searched if [the correctional facility] had made the constitutionally required \nassessment is a defense to a particu lar class memberโs claim for damages, not a defense \nto  the class-wide claim that the Count y  searched everyone without m aking  any \nassessment at all.โ); Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 2004 WL 1125922, *4 (N.D. Ill. \nMay 17, 2004) (comm on questions predominate over individual issues where, as here, \nโthe ultimate legal question is not whethe r jail personnel m ade erroneous reasonable \n  25\n\nsuspicion  determinations  regarding  each indiv idual,  but  whether th e  Sheriffโs policy  \navoided all such inquiry, thus depriving those individuals of their Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights.โ) (Ex. U); Lee v. Perez, 175 F. Supp.2d 673, 679 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). \nFurther, reasonable suspicion is an affirmative defense that the City will need to  \nprove at trial by a preponderance of the evidence, see Curry v. City of Syracuse, 316 F.3d \n324, 330 (2d Cir. 2003), and one that the City cannot prove in the absence โof any \nevidence that its employees had any particular knowledge at the time of the searches that \nwould give them any basis for such a belief.โ   Doe v. Calumet City, 754 F. Supp. 1211, \n1220 (N.D. Ill. 1990);  see also Sutton v. Hopkins County , 2007 WL 119892, *8.  โTo \nrequire  Plaintiff to prove that each indi vidual  search was unsupportable, as well as \nindiscriminate, would be unnecessary and unfair.โ  Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 24.  In short, โthe \nburden rests on [the City of Philadelphia] to  demonstrate that particular searches were \nreasonable.โ  Id.  In light of the proof taken in this action and the Cityโs adm issions \nregarding the uniform nature of the strip search policy, it is unlik ely that the City can \ndetail even one prospective class member that was subject to an evaluation for reasonable \nsuspicion. \n  Second, even if issues of reasonable suspicion exist, they do not predominate over \nthe common issues of law and fact.  As noted  by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit: \nDefendants argue that b ecause the reasonableness of any \nsearch  must  be exam ined  on a case by case basis, the \nconstitutionality  of strip  searches  cannot be properly \nevaluated in a class action.   The basis for the complaint,  \nhowever, arises precisely because the Defendants did not \nconduct an individualized assessment of the need for each \nsearch.  Plaintiffs allege ... their constitutional rights were \nviolated by a policy or custom , written or unwritten, to \n  26\n\nsearch every arrestee who entered the jail, regardless of the \nindividual circumstances.  Due to the single le gal theory \nand the similar facts for each Plaintiff, a class action would \nbe superior to individual actions.  \n \nEddleman, 1996 WL 495013, *5; see also Langley v. Coughlin, 715 F. Supp. 522, 557-58 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1989); Tyson v. City of New York , 97 Civ. 3762 (March 18, 1998) (Bench \nDecision) (Ex. V); Sutton v. Hopkins County, 2007 WL 119892, *7 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, \n1007).  Thus, common issues predominate over any individual issues. \nAssuming,  arguendo,  that  the Co urt  allows the City to attem pt  to estab lish \nreasonable suspicion for some detainees despite their uniform written policy, possible \nindividualized  determinations  regarding th e  existence  of reasonable s uspicion  for a \nlimited number of class members do not outweigh the benefits that certification can offer \nin this case.  In the context of a class action defining the proposed class as encompassing \npersons searched pursuant to a blanket policy  requiring all arrestees to be strip searched \nupon admission, any โreasonable suspicion inquiriesโ related to individual arrestees โwill \nbe de minimis,โ in part because โreasonable suspicion must be possessed by some law \nenforcement officer at the time of the search and may not be retroactively imputed.โ  In \nre Nassau County Strip Search C ases, 461 F.3d 219, 224, 230 (2 nd Cir. 2006).  โThe  \nexistence of this defense does โnotโฆ  foreclose class certification.โโ  Id.  (quoting Visa \nCheck, 280 F.3d at 138)).   \n  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit addressed this issue in Tardiff v. Knox \nCounty, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004), a strip search class action prosecuted against a County \nJail in Maine.  There, having em phasized that โthreats of undue  complications as to \nliability  [were]  limited[,]โ  the  Court  rejected the notion that individualized \ndeterminations proscribed a finding that certification was appropriate.  Id., 365 F.3d  at 6.  \n  27\n\nMoreover, the Court explained that โ[i]f there was in fact a rule, custom or policy of strip \nsearching every arrestee or a substantially overlarge category, then it is a fair guess that \nmost arrestees so clas sed were strip searched on that basis.โ  Id.  Concluding that the  \nclass could be narrowed or de-c ertified at a later date if necessary, the Court held that \ncertification was warranted. \n  In yet another case granting certification of a class of individuals challenging the \npropriety of a jail policy providing for blanket strip searches, the Court in  Marriott v. \nCounty of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y. 2005), in itially observed that the \ncommon question among all members of the cl ass was whether the search procedure, \nwhich was applied to a ll admittees, was constitutional.  Notwithstanding uncertainties \nregarding the extent of  the searches and the correspond ing amount of compensatory \ndamages, certification under Rule 23(b)(3) was,  in the Courtโs judgm ent, appropriate.  \nDespite several โminorโ issues, efficiency of the judicial process would be promoted by \nthe certification process.  Id. at 173. \nWhile there are as m any as 2,000 class m embers, there is \none central issue of law โ wh ether the change out strip \nsearch  violates  the F ourth  Amendment.   Piece m eal \nlitigation by multiple plaintiffs in multiple law suits would \nnot promoted efficiency and would be inferior to litigation \nof the issue in one suit. \n \nId. \nSimilarly, in Smith v. Montgomery County, 643 F.Supp. 435 (D.M.D. 1986), the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland certified a class of temporary \ndetainees at a local cou nty detention center who were strip searched absent reasonable \nsuspicion that they possessed either weapons or contraband.   Id. at  437.  In an effort to \nfacilitate  the  class action m echanism,  the  Court  adopted  the br ight  line rule that \n  28\n\nreasonable suspicion exists to strip search felony arrestees, temporary detainees arrested \nfor misdemeanors that involved weapons or  contraband, as well as temporary detainees \nwith prior records for felony offenses or misdemeanors involving weapons or contraband.  \nId. at 439.  In light of the potential for f actual disputes regarding the existence of \nindividualized reasonable suspicion, the Court adopted the following case m anagement \nstructure: \n[T]he Court will leave it to th e parties to determine which \nmembers of the class of tem porary detainees were strip \nsearched  in  violation of their Fourth Am endment  rights \nunder the terms of the Courtโs ruling.  If defendants believe \nthat they had individualized grounds for a reasonable belief \nthat a detainee arrested for a minor offense was concealing \nweapons  or contraband, the defendants shall subm it  a \nwritten  statement  of  those indiv idualized  reasons  to the  \nCourt.  If a ny of the s tatements of reasonable suspicion \ncreate  issues  of fact, brief eviden tiary  hearings  may  be \nnecessary. \n \nId. at 443.  \n  While  the  Defendants  will voc iferously  claim  to the contrary,   other  courts \naddressing blanket strip search policies have  not hesitated to gran t class certification \ndespite post hoc claims of reasonable suspicion.  In fact, prior case precedent has largely \ndisregarded post hoc attempts to justify blanket strip searches on the basis of reasonable \nsuspicion because the attempt to do so is โabsurdโ and โunfair.โ  See Gonzalez v. City of \nSchenectady, 141 F. Supp. 2d 304 (N.D.N.Y. 2001); Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 24. \n2.  Certification  Should Be Granted Even If Damages Vary  \nAmong Class Members \n \nIn order to defeat Rule 23(b)(3) certification, Defendants may argue that this case \nrequires  individual  determination  of dam ages  for each class m ember  and that these \ndamages calculations which will predominate over other common issues.  It is well \n  29\n\nestablished that distinctions in damages will not defeat class certification when there are \ncommon liability issues to be determined.  Seawell v. Universal Fidelity Corp., 235 \nF.R.D. 64 (E.D. Pa. 2006) (โThat damages may have to be calculated individuallyโฆ does \nnot preclude class certification.โ); see also In re Cigna Corp. Securities Litig., 2006 WL \n2433779, *6 (E.D. Pa. 2006) (โThe mere fact that individual members of the class may be \nentitled to different amounts of money damages does not mean that individual questions \npredominate.โ)  (Ex. W ).   Inde ed,  it was  noted  nearly  twenty  years ago   that \nโoverwhelming  weight of authority holds   that the need for individual damages \ncalculations does not diminish the appropriateness of class certification where common \nquestions as to liability predominate.โ  In re Asbestos School Litig., 104 F.R.D. 422, 432 \n(E.D. Pa. 1984) (quoting Wolgin v. Magic Marker Corp., 82 F.R.D. 168, 176 (E.D. Pa. \n1979) (quoting 5 H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions ยง8824(b), at 879 (1977)).   \nCivil rights cases involving al legations of an unconstitutional strip search policy \napplicable  on a routine and generalized ba sis  are partic ularly  well-suited  for  class \ntreatment regardless of variations in the amount of damages to which individual members \nof the class may be entitled.  For e xample, in Marriott v. County of Montgomery , 227 \nF.R.D.  159, 173 (N.D.N.Y. 2005), the court he ld  that certificat ion  was appropriate \nnotwithstanding โquestions of fact differing among the members of the class relate[d] to \nthe extent of the search to which each i ndividual was subjected, which would affect the \namount of compensatory damages.โ The โcommon question [of] whether the change-out, \nstrip  search  procedure applicable to all  admittees,  regardless  of  whether  reasonable \nsuspicion  exists that contraband or w eapons  are possessed, violates the Fourth \n  30\n\nAmendment,โ predominates over the other โminor differences between class membersโฆโ  \nId. \nIn Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004), the First Circuit affirmed the \nlower  courtโs decis ion  to certify   the cla ss  notwithstanding the potential need for  \nindividualized damages determinations.  In so doing, the court observed the multitude of \ntools at its disposal, includi ng formula damages, an agreement on uniform damages for \nall but the most serious claims and the use of special masters to determine the remaining \nclaims, to address these concerns.   Id. at 6-7.  Likewise, in  Calvin v. Sheriff of Will \nCounty, the court rejected the notion that individualized damages concerns outweighed \nthe benefits of class treatment: \nThe fact that damages may vary based on each plaintiffโs \nmental state is not, however, a sufficient reason to deny \ncertification, because the court may bifurcate the lawsuit so \nthat liability is determ ined first.  If defendants are found \nliable,  the court m ay  then revis it  the dam ages  issue, \nincluding whether to certify another class or subclasses, or \nhold  individual hearings, for the purpose of resolving \ndamages. \n \nCalvin, 2004 WL 1125922 at *5; see also Sutton v. Hopkins County , 2007 WL 119892, \n*8  (notwithstanding โsom e  variation  in th e  class m embersโ  amount  of dam ages, \nnumerous  cases exist in which courts have   rejected arg uments  that differences in \ndamages  among  the class m embers  should pr eclude  class certifi cation.โ)(internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). \nThis Court can utilize various โmanagement tools ... to address any individualized \ndamages issues that might arise in a class action , including (1) bifurcating liability and \ndamages trials with the sam e or different  juries; (2) appointing a m agistrate judge or \nspecial master to preside over individual damages proceedings; (3) decertifying the class \n  31\n\nafter the liability trial and providing notice to class members concerning how they may \nproceed to prove damages; (4) creating subclasses; or (5) altering or amending the class.โ  \nVisa Check, 280 F.3d at 141.  The United States District Court for the Southern Distri ct \nof New York used these m anagement tools when providing full certification of a strip \nsearch class action involving 53,000 pretrial detainees.  See Tyson, 97 Civ. 3762, pp. 4-5 \n(March 18, 1998).  The Southern District of New York held that:   \nOn the damages question, I note that I need not decide at \nthis point whether damages can be awarded on a class-wide \nbasis  or whether there n eeds  to be individualized \ndeterminations of damages for each plaintiff.  I simply note \nthat the most efficient way to resolve all of the issues in this \ncase  is in one forum ,  and if I should determ ine  that \nindividualized determinations need to be made with respect \nto each plaintiff, there are numerous options available.  If \nmy  time  is too short to preside over the dam age \ndeterminations,  we do have  Magistrate  Judges, visiting \njudges,  and the possibility   of  a Special Masterโs \ninvolvement. \n \nId.  The  Tyson case was later resolved, with a settlement utilizing a point system to \nprovide compensation to individual class members.   \nIn the event that the Court is co nvinced that the poten tial for individualized \ndamages determination is so substantial as to preclude certification as to all issues, the \nproposed class should, at a m inimum, be partially certified as to liability.  See Maneely, \n208 F.R.D. at 78 (โ[I]t would  be improper to let manageability concerns overwhelm the \npredominance decision.  There is a comm on issue at the core of th is case โ whether \ndefendants maintained an unconstitutional blanket strip search policy during the class ... I \nfind these common issues represent a sufficient constellation of common issues binding \nthe class member together.โ) (internal quotation marks omitted); Sutton v.  Hopkins \nCounty, 2007 WL 119892, *8 (โ[T]he potential for  varying claims of damages does not \n  32\n\nmandate class decertification. Instead, the Court will bifurcate the lawsuit permitting the \nDefendants' liability to be dete rmined initially. In the event a jury d etermines that the \nHopkins County Jail maintained an unconstitutional blanket strip search policy, the Court \nwill then determine the best approach fo r the second phase of the litig ation.โ).

The Superiority of the Class Action Mechanism is Clear  \nGiven the nature of this action and the f act that a substan tial proportion of the \nclass  membership  is compri sed  of econom ically  disenfranchised  individuals,  a class \naction is also the superior m ethod by which  to adjudicate claims of individual class \nmembers.  Poor and marginalized class m embers are unlikely to be able to litiga te their \ncases individually.   See Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 25;  D'Alauro v.

See  Califano v. Y amaski,  42  U.S. 682, 700-701 (1979); \nDodge, 226 F.R.D. at 183 (โW here a single iss ue (such as the existence of a uniform  \npolicy) is guaranteed to come up time and time again, issues of judicial economy strongly \nmilitate in favor of resolving that issue via a techniques that will bind as many persons as \npossible.โ); Sutton v. Hopkins County, 2007 WL 119892, *9 (holding that โa class action \nprovides the most feasible and efficien t method of determining liabilityโ where suit \nalleges existence if a uniform unconstitutional strip search policy). Assuming, arguendo, \nthat summary judgment is not eventually gr anted against the City  of Philadelphia on \nbehalf of the entire proposed class, the trial in  this action will last for weeks, with scores  \nof jail employees being examined about the practices of the City of  Philadelphia in an \neffort to establish municipal liability.  Even having a small proportion of class members \nhave duplicative trials on this  issue would be an enorm ous waste of judicial resources, \nand would not be the superior and appropriate way to resolve this controversy.   \nFor  these r easons,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  suggest  that  the  Motion f or  Class \nCertification be granted. \nF.  Plaintiffs Have Also Satisfied the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) \n \nRule 23(b)(2) permits certification when โthe party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declarat ory relief with respect to the class as a \n  34\n\nwhole.โ   Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2).

The City of Philadelphia, however, has all of the \ninformation regarding the addresses and social  security numbers of all prospective class \nmembers in electronic format, which can presumably be accessed to form a database and \nprovide a mass mailing.  Plaintiff respectfully suggests that  the City be required to \n\"provide the notice or ... cooperate with plaintiff by giving him the information necessary \nto provide the notice.โ  Id., at 460.  \nIV.  Conclusion  \n  For  these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully requ est  that th eir  Motion for Class  \nCertification be granted, and the Court provide any other relief it finds to be just, proper \nand equitable. \nRespectfully submitted by: \n \n \n       /s   Daniel C.

The City of Philadelphia admits that it conducts blanket strip searches upon all \npre-trial detainees remanded to the custody of the Philadelphia Prison System, regardless \nof criminal charge or reasonable suspicion.  These searches could not be more degrading.  \nAll members of the proposed class are required to disrobe in front of a Corrections \nOfficer, and are then required to bend or manipulate themselves to allow for a visual \ninspection of the genitals and body cavities.  Under the Cityโs written strip search policy, \nthese searches are to be done with a Corrections Officer using a flashlight to illuminate \nbody cavities.   \nThe present situation cries out for the Court to issue a preliminary injunction to \nenjoin the illegal practices of the City of Philadelphia.  Despite the filing of this action, \ncompelling discovery taken by the Plaintiffs demonstrates that the Cityโs policy and \npractice of strip searching all individuals detained in PPS facilities continues nonetheless.  \nOther federal courts, when faced with the same situation, have not hesitated to enter \ninjunctions to protect the constitutional rights of pre-trial detainees.  See, Marriott v. \nCounty of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y.), affโd, 2005 WL 3117194 (2d Cir. \n2005) (class certification, preliminary injunction in strip search class action); Marriott v. \nCounty of Montgomery, 426 F. Supp.2d 1 (N.D.N.Y. 2006) (summary judgment and \npermanent injunction in favor of a certified class).  Given the circumstances of this case, \n  1\n\n \nwhere the City has not only violated but continues to violate the constitutional rights of \nthousands of individuals on a regular and consistent basis, Plaintiffs respectfully urge the \nCourt to issue a preliminary injunction barring the City from continuing to strip search \npretrial detainees admitted to the custody of PPS absent reasonable suspicion that the \ndetainee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime charged, the \nparticular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \nI.  Procedural History \n  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the procedural history set forth in the \nMemorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffโs Motion for Class Certification.   \nOn February 23, 2007, after the filing of the class certification motion and with \nCourt approval, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against the City naming George \nByrd  as  the  second  named  plaintiff  and  representative  of  the  Class  defined  in  the \ncertification  motion.    For  the  reasons  set  forth herein, Plaintiffs submit this motion \nseeking a preliminary injunction barring the City from continuing to illegally strip search \npretrial detainees admitted to the custody of PPS absent reasonable suspicion.   \nII.  Factual Background  \nThe facts underlying this motion have been the subject of considerable briefing \nbefore the Court, and will only be summarized briefly here.  A more thorough recitation \nof the facts relevant to this motion can be found in the Memorandum of Law in Support \nof the Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification, and the prior briefing before the Court \nregarding  the  cross-motions  for  summary  judgment.  The  City  of  Philadelphia  has \nadmitted in this proceeding, repeatedly, that it conducts uniform strip and visual body \ncavity searches upon all pretrial detainees admitted to the Philadelphia Prison System.  \n  2\n\n \nThese searches include forcing a detainee to disrobe in front of a Corrections Officer, and \nthen manipulate themselves to allow for the visual inspection of their body parts and \nbody cavities.  Men have their genitals and anus subjected to a visual inspection.  Women \nare subjected to a similar examination, and must also manipulate their breasts.  Women \nare also forced to โsquatโ to see if any contraband discharges from their vagina.  These \nsearches are done on a uniform basis and in the absence of any individualized reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that a detainee is harboring weapons or contraband. \nThe Cityโs written policies require these indiscriminate searches, and the Cityโs \nRule 30(b)(6) deponent, Major James DiNubile, readily admits that this written policy is \nfollowed in PPS facilities.  (PPS Search Policy, pp. 2, 6, 8 (Keach Aff., Ex. A); DiNubile \nDep., pp. 65-66, 141-148, 178-180 (Keach Aff., Ex. B)).  While the City has previously \nclaimed that reasonable suspicion existed to strip search Nakisha Boone, the PPS written \nstrip search policy and the Cityโs deponent confirm that the City does not consider \nwhether reasonable suspicion exists to strip search detainees โ all detainees are strip \nsearched. (Id.)   \nAs part of discovery in this action, the Plaintiffs have deposed multiple PPS \nCorrections Officers who have also confirmed that strip searches are conducted on a \nblanket basis in PPS facilities.  Specifically, the Plaintiffs deposed the three Corrections \nOfficers who were reported to be on duty at the time Plaintiff Nakisha Boone was \nadmitted  to  the  custody  of  the  Philadelphia  Prison  System.    All  of  these  officers \nconfirmed that everyone is subjected to a strip and visual cavity search upon admission to \nPPS regardless of reasonable suspicion or criminal charge, that the practice continues \nuntil today, and that no effort is made to determine the background of those being \n  3\n\n \nsearched.  (Singleton Dep., pp. 38-42, 57-58, 68-69 (Keach Aff., Ex. C); Harold Dep., pp. \n99-102, 123-24, 109-111 (Keach Aff., Ex. D); Sareem Bryant Dep., pp. 17-19 (Keach \nAff., Ex. E)).   A substantial minority of these detainees, namely those arrested on bench \nwarrants, are strip searched prior to even seeing a hearing officer.  (E.g., Harold Dep., pp. \n117-18).  The uniform manner in which these searches are conducted was best described \nby Corrections Officer Lorraine Singleton, who testified that there are:  โNo exception[s].  \nNo discrimination to race, weight, height, repeat offender, new admit, the first time come \n[sic] in, thereโs no discrimination.โ  (Singleton Dep., pp. 57-58).   \nIn short, there is no dispute regarding the facts underlying this action.  The City \nstrip searches everyone pursuant to a uniform written policy and formal practice.  The \nPlaintiffs maintain that this policy and practice violates the Fourth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution, and respectfully request that the Court enjoin the City from \ncontinuing to violate the constitutional rights of the Plaintiffs and the proposed class.   \nIII.  Preliminary Injunctive Relief is Necessary to Safeguard the Constitutional \nRights of Individuals Admitted to PPS Facilities  \n \nIn  order  for  a  preliminary  injunction  to  issue,  Plaintiffs  must  establish  the \nfollowing elements: \n(1) that they are reasonably likely to prevail eventually in \nthe  litigation  and  (2)  that  they  are  likely  to  suffer \nirreparable injury without reliefโฆ  If factors one and two \nare established, the court must then consider factors three \nand  four:  (3)  whether  an  injunction  would  harm  the \n[defendants]  more  than  denying  relief  would  harm  the \nplaintiffs and (4) whether granting relief would serve the \npublic interest. \n \nBowers v. City of Philadelphia, 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 5804, *61 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 25, 2007) \n(internal  quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted)  (quoting  Tenafly  Eruv  Assโn,  Inc.  v. \n  4\n\n \nBorough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, 157 (3d Cir. 2002)).  Here, the Plaintiffs maintain that \nthey have established all of these elements, and that the Court should order the City to \ncease illegally strip searching detainees admitted to the Philadelphia Prison System. \nA.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Prevail in this Litigation, As Federal Courts \nHave Universally Held that Blanket Jail Strip Search Policies are \nUnconstitutional  When  Applied  to  Individuals  Charged  with \nMisdemeanors or Other Minor Crimes \n \ni.  The  City  of  Philadelphiaโs  Blanket  Strip  Search  Policy,  as \nApplied to Individuals Charged with Misdemeanors and Other \nMinor Crimes, is Patently Unconstitutional \n \nThe  Fourth  Amendment  protects  citizens  against  unreasonable  searches  and \nseizures by the government.  In the context of searches incident to criminal detention, the \nUnited States Supreme Court held in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), that  \n[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth amendment is \nnot capable of precise definition or mechanical application.  \nIn each case it requires a balancing of the need for the \nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that \nthe search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of the \nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, \nthe justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is \nconducted. \n \nId. at 559.  An examination of oneโs naked body, especially someoneโs anus and vagina, \nclearly constitutes โan invasion of personal rights of the first magnitude.โ  Chapman v. \nNichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395 (10th Cir. 1993).  โ[F]ew exercises of authority by the stateโฆ \nintrude on a citizenโs privacy and dignity as severely as the visual anal and genital \nsearches practiced here.โ  Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. \n1983).  In fact, the visual cavity searches in question here โcould not have been more \ndegrading.โ  Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F.Supp. 2d 131, 133 (D. Mass. 2001) (Gertner, \nD.J.) \n  5\n\n \n  Circuit Courts, when considering the balancing test required by Wolfish, have \nuniformly held that strip and visual cavity searches cannot be utilized against individuals \ncharged with, but not convicted of, minor crimes (misdemeanors, summary offenses, \narrests on bench warrants, etc.) in the absence of reasonable suspicion to believe a \ndetainee is in possession of a weapon or contraband.1  See Wood v. Hancock County \nSheriffโs Depโt., 354 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 2003); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 801 (2d \nCir. 1986); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981); Stewart v. Lubbock \nCounty, 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1985); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 \n(6th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273; Jones v. \nEdwards, 770 F.2d 739, 742 (8th Cir. 1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th \nCir. 1984); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395-96 (10th Cir. 1993); Justice v. City of \nPeachtree  City,  961  F.2d    199,  193  (11  Cir.  1992).    This  is  because  โ[r]equiring \nparticularized  reasonable  suspicion  to  strip  search  misdemeanant  arrestees  balances \ninstitutional  security  needs  with  individual  privacy,  which  includes  a  reasonable \nexpectation not to be unclothed involuntarily, to be observed unclothed or to have oneโs \nprivate parts observed or touched by others.โ  Wood, 354 F.3d at 62 (quotation marks \nomitted).   \n                                                 \n1 Over twenty class actions have been successfully prosecuted regarding this practice, including several in \nmajor urban areas like Philadelphia.  See Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y., \naffโd, 2005 WL 3117194 (2d Cir. 2005) (certification in strip search class action litigated by co-lead \ncounsel in this case); Kahler v. County of Rensselaer, No. 03-CV-1324 (TJM/DRH), 2005 WL 1981300 \n(N.D. N.Y. Aug. 17, 2005) (Troy, Rensselaer County, New York; settlement negotiated by co-lead counsel \nin this case); Dodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (Newburgh, Orange County, \nNew York); McBean v. City of New York, 228 F.R.D. 487 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (Rikers Island Detention \nCenter, New York City); Haney v. Miami-Dade Co., No. 04-CV-20516-CIV, 2004 WL 2203418 (S.D. Fla. \nAug. 24, 2004) (Miami-Dad County Jail); Mack v. Suffolk Co., 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000) (Boston, \nSuffolk County, Massachusetts); Bynum v. District of Columbia, 384 F. Supp. 2d 342 (D. D.C. 2005) \n(Washington, District of Columbia); Nilsen v. York Co., 400 F.Supp. 2d 206 (D. Me. 2005) (summarizing \nsettlements). \n \n  6\n\n \n  Because Corrections Officers โshould be able to detect contraband on the person \nof a detainee without the need for a body cavity inspectionโฆ the deterrent rationale for \nthe Bell search is simply less relevant given the essentially unplanned nature of an arrest \nand subsequent incarceration.โ  Roberts v. State of Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 111 (1st \nCir.  2001).    This  is  especially  true  because  the  individuals  in  question  are  pretrial \ndetainees who have not been convicted of a crime.  The requirement of reasonable \nsuspicion has been applied regardless of whether the misdemeanants in question were \narraigned prior to being committed to a local jail.2  See, Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 65 \n(2d  Cir.  2001);  Newkirk,  834  F.  Supp.  at  788-90  (post-arraignment  misdemeanor \ndetainees at the Schuylkill County Jail).   \nThe courts in this Judicial Circuit have reached a similar conclusion, including \nseveral judges of this Court and other courts in the judicial circuit.  See e.g. Newkirk v. \nSheers, 834 F.Supp. 772, 789-91 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (blanket strip searches at the Schuylkill \ncounty Jail found unconstitutional as against misdemeanor defendants; โIt is beyond \ndoubt that the officially adopted policy of Schuylkill county requiring all individuals \nadmitted to [the] county Prison, including pretrial detainees, undergo strip and visual \ncavity searches, does not pass constitutional muster to the extent that the policy permits \nthe indiscriminate strip search of a detainee without requiring a particularized reasonable \nsuspicion that the detainee is concealing a weapon or harboring contraband or drugs.โ); \nDuffy v. County of Bucks, 7 F.Supp. 2d 569, 580 (E.D. Pa. 1998) (โPolicies permitting \nstrip-searches  of  all  inmates  not  based  on  concerns  for  institutional  security  or  the \n                                                 \n2 The fact that a detainee is intoxicated does not, in and of itself, establish reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat a detainee is carrying weapons or other contraband.  See, Dodge v. County of Orange, 209 F.R.D. 65, \n77 (S.D. N.Y. 2002) (citing cases from other circuits reaching the same conclusion). \n \n  7\n\n \ninmateโs  criminal  history  have  been  held  unconstitutional,โ  providing  extensive \ncitations); Davis v. City of Camden, 657 F. Supp. 396, 400-01 (D. N.J. 1987) (strip \nsearches in Camden County Jail); OโBrien v. Borough of Woodbury Heights, 679 F.Supp. \n429, 433 (D.N.J. 1988) (blanket strip search policy at the Gloucester County Jail).  \nDistrict Courts from outside of the Third Circuit have also addressed blanket strip \nsearch policies, and found them to be unconstitutional.  The District of Massachusetts, \nwhen faced with a motion for summary judgment brought by a similarly situated female \nplaintiff and a proposed class of women subjected to a uniform strip search at the Suffolk \nCounty Jail in Boston, granted summary judgment and held that  \n[a]n indiscriminate strip-search policy routinely appliedโฆ \ncannot be justified simply on the basis of administrative \nease  in  attending  to  security  considerationsโฆ    While  I \nunderstand the Countyโs concern over institutional security, \nthat  concern  does  not  excuse  the  countyโs  decision  to \nrequire the women in the plaintiff class โ many of whom \nhad yet to see a judge โ to endure the indignities of a strip \nand visual body cavity search. \n \nFord, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 142.  The United States District Court for the Northern District \nof New York, when faced with a motion for injunctive relief, has done the same.  See \nMarriott,  227  F.R.D.  at  168-69,  174.    Thus,  the  Cityโs  strip  search  policy  is \nunconstitutional. \nii.  The  City  of  Philadelphia  Cannot  Now  Manufacture \nReasonable  Suspicion  When  All  Members  of  the  Proposed \nClass  Were  Stripped  Searched  Through  a  Uniform  Strip \nSearch Policy. \n \nTo the extent the City plans, after the fact, to manufacture reasonable suspicion to \nstrip search Ms. Boone, Mr. Byrd, or other detainees, they cannot do so in light of their \nadmission  that  every  individual  admitted  to  the  PPS  is  strip  searched  regardless  of \n  8\n\n \nreasonable suspicion.  As โthe burden rests of Defendants to demonstrate that particular \nsearches were reasonable,โ to โrequire Plaintiff[s] to prove that each individual search \nwas unsupportable, as well as indiscriminate, would be unnecessary and unfair.โ  Mack v. \nCounty of Suffolk, 191 F.R.D. 16, 24 (D. Mass. 2000); see also, Gonzalez v. City of \nSchenectady, 141 F. Supp. 2d 304, 309 (N.D.N.Y. 2001 (effort to establish reasonable \nsuspicion after admitting blanket strip searches โdefies logic and, frankly, is absurdโ); \nDavis v. City of Camden, 657 F.Supp. 396, 401 (D. N.J. 1987) (โ[W]hen an arrestee \ncharged  with  a  felony  or  a  misdemeanor  involving  weapons  or  contraband  is  strip \nsearched pursuant to a policy encompassing all arrestees, regardless of the nature of their \noffenses, and where it is conceded that no suspicion regarding the particular arrestee \nexisted, the requisite justification for the search is lacking; neither the general policy nor \nits particular application is supportable.โ) (emphasis in original); Dodge v. County of \nOrange, 226 F.R.D. 177, 182 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (โIf individualized assessments were in \nfact  not  made,  then  all  the  searches  were  illegal,  because  each  new  arrival  was \nconstitutionally entitled to an individualized assessment of his or her circumstancesโฆ  \n[T]he fact that a particular class member could have been lawfully strip searched if [the \ncorrectional facility] had made the constitutionally required assessment is a defense to a \nparticular class memberโs claim for damages, not a defense to the class-wide claim that \nthe County searched everyone without making any assessment at all.โ); Calvin v. Sheriff \nof Will County, 2004 WL 1125922, *4 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2004) (โthe ultimate legal \nquestion  is  not  whether  jail  personnel  made  erroneous  reasonable  suspicion \ndeterminations regarding each individual, but whether the Sheriffโs policy avoided all \nsuch inquiry, thus depriving those individuals of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment \n  9\n\n \nrights.โ); Lee v. Perez, 175 F. Supp.2d 673, 679 (S.D.N.Y. 2001); Doe v. Calumet City, \n754 F.Supp. 1211, 1221 n. 23 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (the City โcannot justify post-hoc an \nunreasonable intrusion without showing that each officer involved had such a reasonable \nbasis at the time of the searchโฆ [I]n the absence of [a] specific policy [providing \nguidelines for establishing reasonable suspicion, the] City cannot now manufacture bases \nin an effort to legitimatize the strip searches that were inflicted on plaintiffs.โ).  Thus, \nsince no effort was made to determine at their entrance whether reasonable suspicion \nexisted, the City is estopped from arguing it now. \niii.  Protecting  the  Security  Interests  of  a  Local  Jail  Does  Not \nJustify the Uniform Strip Search Policy.   \n \nThe City will assert that strip searching all pretrial detainees is necessary to \nprotect against the admission of drugs and weapons into the prison.  The Cityโs blanket \nstrip search policy is clearly unreasonable under the standards enunciated in Bell.3  As an \ninitial  mater,  this  issue  has  already  been  addressed  by  the  Eastern  District  of \nPennsylvania.  In Newkirk, Senior Judge Van Antwerpren assessed the constitutionality \nof strip search policies at the Schuylkill County Prison.  The detainees in question were \npost-arraignment detainees who were subjected to strip searches upon admission to a \nlocal jail because they could not, or would not, make bail.  In a thorough and well-\n                                                 \n3 The Cityโs prior contention, made in response to the motion for summary judgment previously filed in \nthis action, that the United States Supreme Court decision in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1997), \nsomehow overrules the balancing testing provided by the Supreme Court in Bell, is likewise without merit.  \nSee, Foote v. Spiegel, 995 F.Supp. 1347, 1359 n.2 (D. Utah. 1998) (โBecause the Fourth Amendment test is \nalready one of reasonableness under the circumstances, the court finds that the Bell factors, formulated \nspecifically for use in the Fourth Amendment context, are more appropriate for use in this [blanket strip \nsearch case] than the factors promulgated in Turnerโ); Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 65-66 (2d Cir. 2001) \n(holding that Turner does not apply to local correctional facilities); Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521, \n1540 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc) (concurring opinion) (โIf we say that any legitimate penological interest, no \nmatter how minor, requires us to find that a prisonโs policy is valid, then we cannot find any policy invalid, \nbecause a prison will rarely if ever adopt a policy that lacks even a colorable claim of validity.  Rather, a \nprison policy must be invalidated if, after giving due deference to the knowledge and experience of prison \nadministrators, we find that the constitutional  infringement outweighs the prisonโs legitimate penological \ninterests[;]โ utilizing Bell to evaluate cross-gender strip searches) (emphasis supplied). \n  10\n\n \nreasoned  opinion,  Judge  Van  Antwerpen  considered  the  case  authority  from  other \ncircuits, much of which is provided in Plaintiffsโ brief, and unequivocally ruled that \nSchuylkill Countyโs blanket strip policy was unconstitutional.  The Court held: \nWhile the need to ensure prison security is a legitimate and \nsubstantial concern, we believe that, on the facts here, the \nstrip searches bore an insubstantial relationship to security \nneeds  so  that,  when  balanced  against  plaintiffsโ  privacy \ninterests,  the  searches  cannot  be  deemed  โreasonableโโฆ  \nBased on these principles, and a balancing of the factors in \nBell, we are compelled to find that ensuring the security \nneeds of the Schuylkill County Prison by strip searching g \nplaintiffs  was  unreasonable  without  a  particularized \nsuspicion by the authorities that either of the twin dangers \nof concealing weapons or contraband existed. \n \nNewkirk, 834 F. Supp. at 789-90.  Although the plaintiffs in Newkirk โwere placed into \ncontact with the general prison population, such a factor by itself cannot justify a strip \nsearch.โ  Id. at 789.  The Court concluded by holding that โ[t]he feelings of humiliation \nand degradation associated with being forced to expose oneโs nude body to strangers for \nvisual inspection is beyond dispute.โ  Id.; see also, Thompson v. County of Cook, 412 \nF.Supp. 2d 881, 889-90 (N.D. Ill. 2005); Martino v. County of Camden, No. Civ. 04-5300 \n(JBS), 2005 WL 1793718, *12 (D. N.J. July 26, 2005).   \n  In fact, during the course of preparing this case, Defendants performed a thorough \ninvestigation  of  incident  reports  maintained  by  the  Philadelphia  Prison  System  to \ndetermine  the  actual  risk  of  contraband  entering  PPS  facilities.    Lieutenant  Edward \nBender was initially asked by the City to identify all inmates who were found guilty of \ndisciplinary charges for having contraband.  (Bender Dep., p. 50 (Keach Aff., Ex. F)).   \nLt. Bender then narrowed his search to include only those inmates who were found guilty \nof such charges within four days of entering prison facilities. (Id. at 50-51).  For the years \n  11\n\n \n2000-2006, Lieutenant Bender identified 131 individuals who fit these specifications. (Id. \nat p. 64).   The Defendant, in its response to Nakisha Booneโs Motion for Summary \nJudgment, found that of those 131 pre-trial detainees that were found to have contraband \nwithin four to five days of entering the prison system, only seven were charged with \nmisdemeanor charges and were found to have drugs or weapons in their possession.  See \nDefendantsโ Brief in Support of Mtn. for Summary Judg., at 21-23.  While the Plaintiffs \nhave not been able to precisely identify the number of misdemeanor admissions during \nthis  time  period,  they  have  previously  estimated  that  the  City  admitted  70,000 \nmisdemeanor detainees to PPS from 2000 through 2006.  Of these seven (out of 70,000), \nfive were detained on drugs charges, while the other two had extensive criminal histories.  \nThus, under a policy employing the reasonable suspicion standard, these individuals \nwould likely have been strip searched anyway.   \nThe Defendant has not demonstrated any security need to require uniform strip \nsearches.  Roberts v. State of Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2001); Ford v. \nCity of Boston, 154 F. Supp. 2d 131, 137 (D. Mass. 2001) (contraband discovered โfive \ntimes,โ or 0.063 percent of the time, during admissions to Suffolk County Jail); John \nDoes, 613 F. Supp. 1514, 1522 (D. Minn. 1985)  (โplaintiffs make persuasive statistical \nargument that the possession of contraband by new detainees at the jail is at worst an \nisolated problemโ).  The reason why so few detainees are caught with contraband at this \nstage during their arrest and detention is because โit is far less likely that smuggling of \ncontraband will occur subsequent to arrestโฆgiven the essentially unplanned nature of an \narrest and subsequent incarceration.โ  Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111. \n  12\n\n \niv.  The  City  of  Philadelphiaโs  Policy  of  Intermingling  Pretrial \nDetainees With Convicted Detainees is Not a Justification for \nits Uniform Strip Search Policy. \n \nThe  City  asserts  intermingling  pre-trial  detainees  with  convicted  prisoners \njustifies their uniform strip search policy.  โSeveral courts, including many courts of \nappeal, however, have held that intermingling alone is insufficient to justify a [strip] \nsearch without reasonable suspicion.โ  Calvin, 405 F. Supp. 2d at 943.  Several other \ncases detailed in this brief, including Roberts from the First Circuit and Shain from the \nSecond, have reached this identical conclusion.  See also, Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F. 2d \n393, 394-397 (10th cir. 1993); Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 68 (2nd Cir. 1988) (blanket \nstrip  searching  is  not  expectable  merely  because  intermingling  existed);  Giles  v. \nAckerman,  746  F.2d  614,  618  (9th  Cir.  1984),  cert.  Denied,  471  U.S.  1053  (1985) \n(because a detainee was intermingling with a prison population does not, by itself, justify \nstrip search as such intermingling is โboth limited and avoidableโ).  Thus, the Cityโs \nintermingling policy does not justify its use of a uniform strip search policy. \nB.  Plaintiffs and Members of the Putative Class are Likely to Suffer \nIrreparable Injury Without Injunctive Relief \n \nAs demonstrated above, Plaintiffs are substantially likely to prevail upon their \nclaim that the constitutional rights of detainees admitted to PPS facilities have been \nviolated.    The  violation  of  a  constitutional  right  constitutes  irreparable  harm  which \njustifies injunctive relief.  Bowers v. City of Philadelphia, 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 5804, \n*92-93 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 25, 2007) (in a certified class action alleging unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement at PPS facilities, the court found that irreparable harm would \nresult  absent  preliminary  injunctive  relief  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  named \nplaintiffs  were  no  longer  pretrial  detainees  enduring  the  conditions  alleged  in  the \n  13\n\n \ncomplaint); Lewis v. Kugler, 446 F.2d 1343, 1350 (3d Cir. 1971) (โPersons who can \nestablish that they are being denied their constitutional rights are entitled to relief, and it \ncan no longer be seriously contended that an action for money damages will serve \nadequately to remedy unconstitutional searches and seizures.โ); Maldonado v. Houstoun, \n177 F.R.D. 311, 333 (E.D. Pa. 1997) (โPlaintiffs can demonstrate irreparable harm based \non the sole fact that they will be deprived of their constitutional right to the equal \nprotection of law in the absence of an injunction.โ); Northern Penn. Legal Services, Inc. \nv. County of Lackawanna, 513 F. Supp. 678, 685 (M.D. Pa. 1981) (โViolations of a \nlitigant's constitutional rights constitute \"irreparable harm\" per se. No other injury is \nrequired for an injunction provided that the other necessary ingredients to relief are \npresent.โ); Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 174 (โThe plaintiffs allege violation of a constitutional \nright.  Therefore, irreparable harm is established.โ). \nC.  Failure to Grant Injunctive Relief Would Cause Substantial Harm to \nPlaintiffs and the Class \n \nThe balance of the hardships clearly weighs in favor of granting injunctive relief \nin this case, where individualsโ constitutional rights are routinely being violated by the \nCity.  See Bowers, 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 5804 at *92-93 (granting motion for preliminary \ninjunctive relief and finding that โit is abundantly clear that an injunction requiring the \nCity [of Philadelphia] to meet basic constitutional standards for the detention of pretrial \narrestees would not harm Defendants more than denying relief would harm Plaintiffs.  \nThe only harm to Defendants is the cost associated with providing conditions of detention \nthat pass constitutional muster while the cost to Plaintiffs, denial of constitutional rights, \nis far greater.โ).  The potential of security risks to PPS facilities, which is limited by PPSโ \nadmission that very few detainees admitted to their facilities had contraband secreted in a \n  14\n\n \nbody cavity, is significantly outweighed by the serious privacy interests that are intruded \nupon in connection with the indignity of a strip search.  This point has been consistently \narticulated by courts applying the Wolfish balancing test and holding that individuals \ndetained on misdemeanor charges may only be strip searched if reasonable suspicion \nexists to believe the detainee is armed or carrying contraband.  See e.g., Wood, 354 F.3d \nat 62 (โwe have recognized that strip searches are intrusive and degrading and, therefore, \nshould not be unreservedly available to law enforcement officersโ) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); Mary Beth G. v. Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983) (โWhile \nthe need to assure jail security is a legitimate and substantial concern, we believe that, on \nthe facts here, the strip searches bore an insubstantial relationship to security needs so \nthat, when balanced against plaintiffs-appellees' privacy interests, the searches cannot be \nconsidered \"reasonable.\"); Dodge v. County of Orange, 282 F. Supp. 2d 41, 86 (D.N.Y. \n2003) (granting permanent injunction enjoining unconstitutional strip search policies at \ncounty jail and noting that โ[h]aving one's constitutional rights violated is, a priori, a \nsubstantial hardship. Moreover, the nature of this particular constitutional violation, being \nstrip  searched,  represents  a  serious  intrusion  that  is  often  humiliating,  even  when \nperformed in the most professional manner.โ).   \nWhat is more, the narrow scope of the injunctive relief sought here takes security \nrisks into account inasmuch as the requested \"injunction does no more than require the \npolice to abide by constitutional requirements.\" Allee v. Medrano, 416 U.S. 802, 814 \n(1974).  Correctional Officers may, in other words, continue to strip search individuals as \nlong as they make the necessary evaluation in order to determine that there is reason to \nbelieve those individuals are carrying contraband.  The officers can look at the nature of \n  15\n\n \ncriminal charges, the past criminal history of the detainee, the personal circumstances of \nthe  detainee,  or  any  number  of  other  factors  to  establish  individualized  reasonable \nsuspicion to search.  The only limitation which would be placed upon Correctional \nOfficers by the injunctive relief requested is that detainees could not be strip searched \nautomatically.   \nD.  Granting Relief Would Serve the Public Interest \nThere is no doubt that a significant public interest would be served by protecting \nthe constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and the Class.  St. Claire v. Cyler, 482 F.Supp. 257, \n260 (D.C. Pa. 1979) (administering a prison under constitutional principals serves public \npurpose); Monmouth County Correctional Inmates v. Lanzaro, 643 F.Supp. 1217, 1228 \n(D.N.J. 1986).  See e.g. Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300, 303 n. 3 (7th Cir. 1978) \n(\"The existence of a continuing constitutional violation constitutes proof of an irreparable \nharm,  and  its  remedy  certainly  would  serve  the  public  interest.โ);  United  States  v. \nWeikert, 421 F. Supp. 2d 259, 271 (D. Mass. 2006) (โthe public interest in fact favors the \ngranting  of  the  preliminary  injunction  since  the  public  has  a  significant  interest  in \nupholding  the  protections  of  the  Fourth  Amendment.โ);  Johnson  v.  Bd.  of  Police \nComm'rs, 351 F. Supp. 2d 929, 951 (D. Mo. 2004) (โIt is not in the public's interest to \nallow police and other officials to engage in a pattern of constitutional violations.โ).  To \nthat end, a preliminary injunction should be issued. \nIV.  Plaintiffs Have Standing to Seek Injunctive Relief \nThe City has previously raised the issue of Ms. Booneโs standing in this litigation, \nclaiming that she โhas not alleged and cannot credibly allege that she reasonably can \nanticipate  again  being  arrested  and,  even  if  she  were  arrested,  eventually  being \n  16\n\n \ntransported  to  the  Prisons.โ    Defs.โ  Mem.  Law  Supp.  Summ.  J.  at  39.    This  exact \nargument has, however, already been addressed and rejected by Judge Surrick in Bowers \nv. City of Philadelphia, a similar case filed to redress constitutional violations occurring \nwithin the PPS.   \nLike the present lawsuit, Bowers was brought as a putative class action on behalf \nof pre-trial detainees in the PPS.  The plaintiffs there allege the existence \nof severe prison overcrowding and concomitant dangerous, \nunhealthy and degrading conditions.  Plaintiffs allege that \nthese  conditions  and  the  policies  and  practices  of \nDefendants  violate  the  Sixth,  Eighth,  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs \nallege that they are pre-trial detainees who, due to severe \novercrowding and lack of adequate facilities, are held at \npolice districts, the Police Administration Building, or at \nintake units of the PPS. \n \nBowers, 2006 U.S. Dist. Lexis 71814, *2-3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 28. 2006).  In the context of \naddressing the plaintiffsโ class certification motion, the Court in Bowers rejected the \nCityโs argument that the plaintiffs lacked individual standing to seek injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief.  Citing Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975) and United States \nParole Commission v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 338 (1980), the Court referenced an exception \nto  the  mootness  doctrine  which  โexist[s]  to  address  short-term  harms  that  would \notherwise evade judicial review.โ  Bowers, 2006 U.S. Dist. Lexis 71814, *21.  Judge \nSurrick held that: \nThis case belongsโฆ to that narrow class of cases in which \nthe termination of a class representativeโs claim does not \nmoot the claims of the unnamed members of the class.  \nPretrial detention is by nature temporary, and it is most \nunlikely  that  any  given  individual  could  have  his \nconstitutional claim decided on appeal before he is either \nreleased or convicted.  The individual could nonetheless \nsuffer  repeated  deprivations,  and  it  is  certain  that  other \n  17\n\n \npersons  similarly  situated  will  be  detained  under  the \nallegedly unconstitutional procedures.  The claim, in short, \nis one that is distinctly โcapable of repetition, yet evading \nreview.โ \n \nId. (quoting Gerstein, 420 U.S. at 111 n. 11).  Concluding that the plaintiffs did, in fact, \nhave standing to bring the class action for injunctive and declaratory relief, the Court \nstated: \nGiven that Plaintiffs allege severe prison overcrowding and \ndangerous, unhealthy, and degrading conditions and given \nthat it is certain that other pretrial detainees are currently \nand  will  in  the  future  be  detained  under  the  allegedly \nunconstitutional conditions, this case certainly belongs to \nthe class of cases for which an exception to mootness must \nbe made. \n \nBowers, 2006 U.S. Dist. Lexis 71914, *23-24. \n  Later in the litigation, Judge Surrick considered a โslightly differentโ version of \nthe Cityโs standing argument in the context of the plaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  Bowers v. City of Philadelphia, 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 5804, *95 (E.D. Pa. \nJan. 25, 2007).  Within that framework, the City contended that the plaintiffs lacked \nstanding and the Court lacked jurisdiction because at the time the complaint was filed, \nโno named plaintiff or class representative had a live claim in that no named plaintiff was \nin the custody of either Police Department holding cells or CFCF intake at that time.โ  \nBowers v. City of Philadelphia, 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 5804 at *95.   \nAs  an  initial  matter,  the  Court  concluded  that  the  named  plaintiff,  held  in \nquarantine at the time the lawsuit was filed, did in fact have standing to pursue injunctive \nrelief  at  the  commencement  of  the  suit.    Id.,  2007  U.S.  Dist.  Lexis  5804  at  *  98.  \nSignificantly,  the  Court  further  held  that  even  if  the  named  plaintiffโs  presence  in \nquarantine had not provided him with standing to sue, two additional grounds existed \n  18\n\n \nestablishing both standing and jurisdiction.  First, the detainee Class members โhad no \nmeaningful ability to request counsel visits or demand the right to file a complaint in \nfederal courtโ during the course of their detention.  Id., 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 5804 at \n*102.  Thus, it would have been impossible for the plaintiffs to file suit while they were \ndetained in PPS facilities.  Also, the Court concluded that due to recidivism rates of the \nnamed plaintiffs, the case presents a situation which is โcapable of repletion, yet evading \nreview.โ  Id., 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 5804 at *102; see also City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, \n461 U.S. 95 (1983) (doctrine โapplies only in exceptional situations, and generally only \nwhere the named plaintiff can make a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected \nto the alleged illegality.โ); Marriott v. County of Montgomery 227 F.R.D. 159, 174 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2005) (Pretrial detainees had standing to bring preliminary injunction claims \nfor unlawful strip search policy of prison).  For these reasons, Judge Surrick concluded \nthat the plaintiffs had standing to pursue injunctive relief and that the Courtโs jurisdiction \nwas intact.   \n  The same rationale applied by Judge Surrick in the decisions issued in Bowers \nshould apply under these circumstances.  Where, as here, there can be no doubt that other \npretrial detainees are currently and will in the future be subjected to unlawful strip \nsearches in PPS facilities, the standing of the named plaintiffs to seek injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief to correct the unconstitutional treatment of pretrial detainees held in \nPPS facilities is obvious. \n \n \n \n  19\n\n \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant their \nMotion for a Preliminary Injunction and issue the proposed order attached hereto. \nRespectfully submitted by: \n \n \n            /s \nDated:  March 23, 2007       _______________________________ \n            Daniel C.

It is not from a lawyer.  You are not being sued. \no  This is a proposed Settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging that corrections \nofficers employed at the Philadelphia Prison System engaged in the illegal strip \nsearches of all individuals charged with only minor offenses upon their enny into \nthe Philadelphia Prison System from April 21, 2003 until October 9,2007.  After \nthe Litigation was filed, Defendant changed its strip search policy.  The proposed \nSettlement does not include individuals who were convicted at the time of their \nadmission to the Philadelphia Prison System, or who were not strip searched \nwhen they entered the Philadelphia Prison System. \no  The Settlement would entitle each Class Member to a share of a $5.9 million \nSettlement Fund (after payment of administrative costs, an incentive award to the \nrepresentative plaintiffs, and attorneys' fees). \no  Visit the Settlement Website at [INSERT] for additional details about the \nSettlement.  You may also get additional information by calling 1-800 [insert \nphone #] or by writing to [insert address]. \no  Your legal rights are affected whether you act or don't act.  Read this notice \ncarefully. \n\nYOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT: \nSubmit a Claim FOl'm  You must submit a Claim Form to receive payment \nunder the Settlement.  You must submit a Claim \nForm by [insert date] to receive any money. \nExclude Yourself  If you exclude yourself from the Settlement, you \nwill not be bound by the Settlement or judgment \nand will not be entitled to a cash payment.  You \nwill be free to pursue your claims against the \nDefendant.  This is the only option that allows you \nto bring or be part of any other lawsuit against the \nDefendant in this case about the same legal claims \nthat are advanced in this case.  You must exclude \nyourself from the Settlement by [Insert Date]. \nObject  If you do not exclude yourself, you may write to \nthe Court about why you do not like the Settlement \nor the request for legal fees and costs.  You must \nsend a written objection to the Court \npostmarked no later than [Insert Date]. \nGo to a Hearing  You may ask to speak in Court about the fairness \nof the Settlement or the request for fees and costs. \nDo Nothing  You get no payment.  You give up your right to sue \nDefendants on these claims later. \no  These rights and options -and the deadlines to exercise them - are explained in \nthis notice. \no  The Court in charge of this case still must decide whether to give final approval to \nthe Settlement.  Likewise, payments to class members will be distributed only if \nthe Court grants final approval of the Settlement and after any appeals are \nresolved. \nI.  WHY DID I GET THIS NOTICE PACKAGE? \nYou or someone in your family may have been admitted to the Philadelphia \nPrison System after being charged with misdemeanors, summmy offenses, traffic \ninfractions, civil commitments, or other minor crimes, or bench warrants or probation \nviolations where the underlying charge was a misdemeanor, summaIY offense or other \nminor crime, from April 21, 2003 to October 9, 2007 and been subject to a strip search. \nYou were sent this notice because you have the right to know about a proposed \nSettlement of a class action lawsuit, and about your options, before the Court decides \nwhether to approve the Settlement.  If the Court approves it, and after any possible \n2 \n\nobjections and appeals are resolved, an administrator appointed by the Court will make \nthe monetary payments that the Settlement allows.  You will be informed of the progress \nof the Settlement.  You should understand that the process of COUl1 approval may take a \ngood deal of time. \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the Settlement, your legal rights, what benefits \nare available, who is eligible for them and how to get them. \nThe Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, United States District Judge Mary A. McLaughlin presiding. \nThe case is called Boone, et al.  v.  City ofP  hiladelphia, Case No. OS-CV-18SI.  The \npersons who sued are called the Plaintiffs, and the municipality they sued, the City of \nPhiladelphia, is called the Defendant. \nII.  WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT? \nPlaintiffs claim in this lawsuit that the City of Philadelphia illegally strip searched \nindividuals upon their admission to the Philadelphia Prison System who were charged \nwith minor offenses, in violation of the unreasonable search provisions of the United \nStates Constitution. Defendant denies that it did anything wrong, and contends that even \nif it did do anything wrong, Plaintiffs and the Class Members are not entitled to any \nmoney as a result of being searched. \nIII.  WHY IS THIS A CLASS ACTION? \nIn a class action, one or more people, called the Class Representatives (in this \ncase, Nakisha Boone and George Byrd), sue on behalf of all people who have similar \nclaims.  All of these people are a Class or Class Members.  A class action resolves the \nissues for all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the Class. \nUnited States District Judge Mary A. McLaughlin is in charge of this class action lawsuit. \nIV.  WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendant.  Instead, both sides \nagreed to a Settlement.  That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people \naffected will get compensation.  The Class Representatives and their attorneys think the \nSettlement is best for evelyone who is alleged to have been illegally strip searched. \nV.  HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM PART OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nEveryone who fits the following description is a Settlement Class Member: you \nwere placed in the custody of the Philadelphia Prison System after being charged with \n3 \n\nmisdemeanors; summary offenses; traffic infractions; civil commitments or other minor \ncrimes; or bench warrants or probation violations where the underlying charge was a \nmisdemeanor, summary offense or other minor crime, and you were strip searched in the \nabsence of reasonable suspicion upon your entry into  the  Philadelphia Prison System \npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Philadelphia Prison System and the \nCity of Philadephia. \nThe Settlement Class includes the following two subclasses: \nSubclass I: \nAll persons in the Settlement Class, EXCEPT for persons who (1) were \ncharged  with  certain  violence,  drug  and/or  weapons  (hereinafter  \"VDW\")  related \nmisdemeanor charges at the time  of their admission,  or (2) were charged with bench \nwarrants  andlor  probation  violations  where  the  underlying  charge  was  a  VDW \nmisdemeanor  charge,  or  (3)  had  convictions  for  felonies  and/or VDW  misdemeanor \ncharges predating the date of their admission. \nSubclass II: \nAll  persons in the  Settlement Class  who  were  (1)  charged with  VDW \nmisdemeanor charges at  the time of their admission, or (2) were charged with bench \nwarrants  and/or  probation  violations  where  the  underlying  charge  was  a  VDW \nmisdemeanor charge,  or  (3)  had  convictions  for  felonies  andlor  VDW  misdemeanor \ncharges predating the date of their admission. \nThe Class Period commences on April 21, 2003 and extends to October 9, 2007. \nThe Settlement does not cover individuals who entered the Philadelphia Prison \nSystem after being convicted of (as compared to only being charged with) a crime, or \nanyone who entered the Philadelphia Prison System but was not strip searched as part of \nthe Philadelphia Prison System's booking procedure. \nVI.  DO I NEED TO PROVE THAT I WAS STRIP-SEARCHED, AND WHAT \nDOES THAT MEAN? \nIn filling out the Claim Form, you will affirm, under penalty of perjury, that you \nwere strip searched during the admission process at the Philadelphia Prison System.  If \nyour name is not contained in Philadelphia Prison System's records, you may be asked to \nprovide additional documentation before being allowed to participate in the Settlement. \nA strip search occurred if, during the admission process, you were ordered to take \noff some or all  of your clothes by a Philadelphia Prison  System employee, with that \nemployee watching you undress.  Some members of the Class may also have been forced \nto bend at the waist or manipulate body patis to allow for a visual inspection.  If you were \n4 \n\nsearched in this  manner when  you  were  booked into  the  facility  and  meet the other \neligibility criteria, you are a member of the Class and entitled to make a claim.  You will \nneed to provide an affilmation on the Claim Form confirming that one of these searches \nwas conducted on you when you entered the Philadelphia Prison System. \nVIII.  HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER THE CRIME FOR WHICH I WAS \nCHARGED UPON ADMISSION TO THE PHILADELPHIA PRISON \nSYSTEM QUALIFIES ME FOR INCLUSION IN THE CLASS? \nYou were placed in the custody of the Philadelphia Prison System after being \ncharged with misdemeanors; summary offenses; traffic infractions; civil commitments or \nother minor crimes; or bench warrants or probation violations where the underlying \ncharge was a misdemeanor, summary offense or other minor crime.  Everyone brought to \nthe Philadelphia Prison System pre-adjudication on such minor offenses and strip \nsearched in the absence of reasonable suspicion upon admission during the Class Period \nis eligible under this Settlement Agreement. \nFor example, you are eligible under the Settlement Agreement if you were \nadmitted to the Philadelphia Prison System subject to a civil commitment.  A civil \ncommitment is an order from a non-criminal cOUli, usually the Family COUli, committing \nthat individual to the Philadelphia Prison System.  Individuals admitted to the \nPhiladelphia Prison System, on a civil commitment, for example, a conunitment for \nfailure to pay child support, are members of the Class. \nSimilarly, if you were arrested and brought to the Philadelphia Prison System for \ntraffic offenses or under traffic warrants, failing to pay fines and contempt, pre \nadjudication, you are eligible under the Settlement Agreement.  Consequently, if you \nfailed to honor a payment order with a municipal court and were arrested, or failed to \nappear for a municipal court date and arrested, brought to the Philadelphia Prison System \nand strip searched, you are eligible to receive a settlement payment. \nIf you were charged with a Serious Misdemeanor, Violation/Bench Warrant with \na Serious Misdemeanor Charge, or had a prior conviction for a felony or Serious \nMisdemeanor predating your admission, you will be a member of Subclass II.  For \npurposes of the Settlement, a Serious Misdemeanor means misdemeanor crimes in the \nPennsylvania Criminal Code that are: (I) weapons, (2) drug, or (3) violence-related.  A \nFelony means the felony crimes in the Pennsylvania Criminal Code.  A Violation/Bench \nWan'ant with a Serious Misdemeanor Charge means admission was for a bench wan'ant \nand/or probation violation where the underlying case included at least one charge that \nmatched one of the Serious Misdemeanor charges at the time of admission. \n5 \n\nIX.  I WAS ADMITTED TO THE PHILADELPHIA PRISON SYSTEM BUT I \nCAN'T REMEMBER WHAT MY CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE.  HOW \nCAN I FIND THIS OUT, AND HOW DO I KNOW IF THE CHARGE WAS \nA MISDEMEANOR OR VIOLATION? \nThere are several ways for potential class members to determine the nature of \ntheir criminal charges.  First, you can review your charging documents, which should \nreflect your actual charges.  If you do not have your charging document and remember \nthe local court where you were prosecuted, the court clerk will be able to help you find \nthese documents. \nIf you need additional help determining whether you are a class member, or of \nyou have other questions, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at [insert \nnumber]. \nYou can still make a claim if you do not remember your criminal charges if you \nbelieve you are a member of the Class, but you may be asked for additional information. \nX.  I PLED GUILTY TO A CRIME. HOW DOES THIS AFFECT MY RIGHT \nTO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nIf you were admitted to the Philadelphia Prison System solely on non-felony or \nother minor charges, as defined above, you can participate in the Settlement regardless of \nhow you resolved your criminal charges, including if you pled guilty to those charges. \nThis is provided that you were admitted to the Philadelphia Prison System during the \nClass Period before being sentenced by a court.  For most Class Members, this would \nmean that they were committed to the Philadelphia Prison System after they were \narraigned before a Judge.  If you were sentenced before admission to the Philadelphia \nPrison System (meaning you were committed after pleading guilty or being convicted at \ntrial) you are not a Class Member. \nXI.  WHAT IF I WAS ADMITTED TO THE PHILADELPHIA PRISON \nSYSTEM ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION DURING THE CLASS \nPERIOD?  CAN I STILL PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nYes.  Individuals who were admitted to the Philadelphia Prison System on more \nthan one occasion during the class period can be members of the class and can recover \nmoney.  They can only recover one payment, however, meaning that you will not be \nprovided with extra payments if you were admitted to the Philadelphia Prison System \nmore than one time.  Your subclass will be detelmined based on your first admission to \nthe Philadelphia Prison System during the Class Period. \n6 \n\nXII.  I AM STILL NOT SURE IF I AM INCLUDED. \nIf you are still not sure if you are included, you can ask for help.  You can call \n[insert number] and the Settlement Administrator or Class Counsel may help answer \nyour questions.  For more information, you can also visit the website, [INSERT], or you \ncan just fill out the Claim Form and return it to the Settlement Administrator to see if you \nqualify. \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS - WHAT YOU GET \nXIII.  WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE? \nDefendant has agreed to pay $5,900,000 (Five Million Nine Hundred Thousand \nDollars) to resolve this Litigation.  The money will be used to: 1) compensate Class \nMembers who have been illegally strip searched; 2) pay $330,000 for notifying Class \nMembers and administering the Settlement; 3) pay incentive awards of$15,000 each to \nthe named Plaintiffs Nakisha Boone and George Byrd; and 4) pay attorneys' fees and \nexpenses. \nA complete description of the Settlement is provided in the Settlement Agreement.  You \ncan get a copy of the Settlement Agreement by visiting [enter website address] or by \ncalling [enter administrator phone number]. \nXIV.  WHAT CAN I GET FROM THE SETTLEMENT? \nThe benefits that you will receive from the Settlement depend on whether you are \na member of Subclass I or Subclass II: \nMembers of Subclass I will receive an equal pro-rata share of $5, 170,000, minus \nan incentive award for the Class Representatives, attorneys' fees, and expenses.  Class \nCounsel anticipates, based on claims rates from other settlements, that all individuals who \nare members of Subclass I that make a claim on the Settlement will receive between $600 \nand $900 as a settlement payment.  These amounts are dependent on how many claims \nare received by the Claims Administrator during the claims period, and are subj ect to \nchange based on the number of claims received.  Payments to members of Subclass I \nshall not exceed $3,000.  No amount is guaranteed. \nMembers of Subclass II will receive an equal pro-rata share of $400,000 minus an \nincentive award for the Class Representatives, attorneys' fees, and expenses.  Class \nCounsel anticipates, based on claims rates from other settlements, that all individuals who \nare members of Subclass II that make a claim on the Settlement will receive between $50 \nand $100 as a settlement payment.  These amounts are dependent on how many claims \n7 \n\nare received by the Claims Administrator during the claims period, and are subject to \nchange based on the number of claims received.  Payments to members of Subclass II \nshall not exceed $100 per claimant.  No amount is guaranteed. \nHOW YOU GET A PAYMENT - SUBMITTING A CLAIM FORM \nXV.  HOW CAN I GET A PAYMENT? \nTo qualifY for a payment, you MUST send in a Claim Form.  A Claim Form is \nattached to this Notice.  You can also get a claim form on the Internet at [INSERT]. \nRead the instructions carefully, fill out the fonn, sign it, and mail it postmarked no later \nthan [insert date]. \nYou may be asked for additional documents, and will be contacted in writing. \nYou may want to send in your claim form by Celiified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, \nto ensure that it is received by the Settlement Administrator. \nXVI.  WHEN WOULD I GET MY PAYMENT? \nThe Court will hold a hearing on [insert date] to decide whether to approve the \nSettlement.  If Judge McLaughlin approves the Settlement, there may be appeals.  It is \nalways uncertain whether those appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take \ntime, perhaps more than a year.  Everyone who sends in a Claim Form will be informed \nof the progress of the Settlement.  Please be patient. \nXVII.  WHAT AM I GIVING UP TO GET A PAYMENT OR STAY IN THE \nCLASS? \nUnless you exclude yourself, you are staying in the Class, and that means yon \ncan't sue, continue to sue, or be pati of any other lawsuit against the City of Philadelphia, \nits employees, or its elected officials about the legal issues in this case.  It also means that \nall the Court's orders will apply to you and legally bind you.  If you sign the Claim FOlID, \nyou will agree to release all claims that you have relating to having been strip searched. \nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT \nIf you do not want a payment from this Settlement, but you want to keep the right \nto sue or continue to sue the City of Philadelphia on your own about the legal issues in \nthis case, then you must take steps to preserve these rights.  This is called excluding \nyourself - or is sometimes refelTed to as \"opting out\" of the Settlement Class. \n8 \n\nXVIII.  HOW DO I GET OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nTo exclude yourselffrom the Settlement, you must send a letter by mail saying \nthat you want to be excluded from Boone, et al. v.  City ofP  hiladelphia.  Be sure to \ninclude your name, address, telephone number and your signature.  You must mail your \nexclusion request postmarked no later than [insert date] to [insert address]. \nYou can't exclude yourself on the phone or by email.  If you ask to be excluded, \nyou will not get any settlement payment, and you cannot object to the Settlement.  You \nwill not be legally bound by anything that happens in this lawsuit.  You may be able to \nsue (or continue to sue) the City of Philadelphia in the future. \nXIX.  IF I DO NOT EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I SUE THE CITY OF \nPHILADELPHIA FOR THE SAME THING LATER? \nNo.  Unless you exclude yourself, you give up the right to sue the City of \nPhiladelphia for the claims that this Settlement involves.  If you have a pending lawsuit, \nspeak to your lawyer in that lawsuit immediately.  You must exclude yourself from this \nclass action to continue your own lawsuit.  Remember, the exclusion deadline is [insert \ndate]. \nXX.  IF I EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I GET MONEY FROM THE \nSETTLEMENT? \nNo.  If you exclude yourself, do not send in a Claim Form to ask for money.  But, \nyou may sue, continue to sue, or be part of a different lawsuit against the City of \nPhiladelphia. \nTHE LAWYERS AND INDIVIDUALS \nREPRESENTING YOU \nXXI.  DO I HAVE A LAWYER IN THIS CASE? \nThe Court approved Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, The Mason Law Firm, LLP, Washington, DC, The Law Offices of Elmer \nRobert Keach, III, PC, Amsterdam, New York, and Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, \nWashington, DC to represent you and other Class Members.  Together, the lawyers are \ncalled Class Counsel.  You will not be charged for these lawyers.  If you want to be \nrepresented by your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense. \n9 \n\nXXII.  HOW WILL THE LA WYERS AND THE CLASS REPRESENTA   TIVES \nBE PAID? \nClass Counsel will ask the Court for attorneys' fees and expenses as a percentage \nofthe $S,900,000 (Five Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars) settlement, and a \npayment of$IS,OOO (Fifteen Thousand Dollars) each for Class Representatives Nakisha \nBoone and George Byrd.  The Settlement Agreement provides that thirty percent of the \nSettlement Fund will be paid to Class Counsel as an award of attorneys' fees, together \nwith an award for the reimbursement of expenses.  These amounts will be deducted from \nthe Settlement Fund before payments are made to Class Members.  The costs of \nadministering the Settlement, which are estimated at $330,000, will also be deducted \nfrom the Settlement Fund. \nOBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT \nYou can tell the Court that you do not agree with the Settlement or some part of it. \nXXIII. HOW DO I TELL THE COURT THAT I DO NOT LIKE THE \nSETTLEMENT? \nIf you are a Class Member, you can object to the Settlement if you don't like any \npart of it.  You can give objections why you think the COUli should not approve it.  The \nCourt will consider your views.  To object, you must send a letter saying that you object \nto Boone, et al. v.  City ofP  hiladelphia, case no. OS-cv-18S1.  Be sure to include your \nname, address, telephone number, your signature, and the reasons why you object to this \nSettlement and the case number (OS-cv-18SI).

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBJECTING AND \nEXCLUDING MYSELF? \nObjecting is simply telling the Comt that you do not like something about the \nSettlement.  You can object only if you stay in the Class.  Excluding yourself is telling \nthe Court that you do not want to be a part of the Class.  If you exclude yourself, you \nhave no basis to object because the case no longer legally affects you. \nTHE COURT'S FAIRNESS HEARING \nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the Settlement.

WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE COURT DECIDE WHETHER TO \nAPPROVE THE SETTLEMENT? \nOn [insert date] the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \nwill hold a fairness hearing in the James A.

DO I HAVE TO COME TO THE HEARING? \nNo.  Class Counsel will answer questions Judge McLaughlin may have.  But you \nare welcome to come at your own expense.  If you send an objection, you do not have to \ncome to Court to talk about it.  As long as you mailed your written objection on time, the \nComt will consider it.  You may also pay your own lawyer to attend, but it is not \nrequired. \nXXVII.  MAY I SPEAK AT THE HEARING? \nYou may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing.  To do so, \n11 \n\nyou must send a letter saying that it is your \"Notice ofIntention to Appear in Boone, et \nal. v.

Hey and former Magistrate Judge James K. Melinson, the Parties have \nreached accord with respect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to \nSettlement Class Members, in return for a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in \nthis case against the Defendant (\"Settlement Agreement\").  The resulting Settlement \nAgreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on _________  \n3.  As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a \nproposed Notice Plan and Class Notice, which provided Settlement Class Members \nnotice of the proposed Settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an opportunity for Class \nMembers to file objections to the Settlement, and an opportunity to opt-out of the \nSettlement. \n4.  As of the deadline for the filing of objections, ___ objections were filed. \nGiven the size ofthis Settlement, and the Notice Plan described above, this Court finds \nthat the comparatively low number of objections is indicative of the fairness, \nreasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement with the Defendant. \n5.  The settling Parties have filed with the Court an affidavit from RSM McGladrey, \nInc. declaring that the mailing of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice \nPlan, has been completed. \n6.  The Court finds that the published notice, mailed notice and Internet posting \nconstitute the best practicable notice of the Fairness Hearing, proposed Settlement, Class \nCounsel's application for fees and expenses, and other matters set fOlih in the Class \nNotice and Short Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient \n2 \n\nnotice to all members of the Settlement Class, and complied fully with the requirements \nof Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, \nthe laws of Pennsylvania and any other applicable law. \n7.  Any persons who wished to be excluded from this action were provided an \nopportunity to \"opt-out\" pursuant to the Notice.  All persons who have validly excluded \nthemselves from the action have no rights under the Settlement Agreement and shall not \nbe bound by the Settlement Agreement or the final judgment herein and the names of \nthose persons are set forth in Exhibit A hereto. \n8.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the: Settlement, Settlement Agreement, \nRelease contained within the Settlement Agreement, and the Final Order and Judgment. \nSettlement Class Members do not have a further opportunity to opt-out of this Action. \n9.  Any Class Member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to \nthe Settlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to  Class \nCounsel's application for fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the procedure set \nforth in the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of \nSettlement, is deemed to have waived any such objection by appeal, collateral attack, or \notherwise. \n10.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable \nand adequate compromise of the claims against the Defendant in this case, pursuant to \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the \nCourt has considered in affirming this Settlement, including: \n3 \n\na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nb.  This Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class Members now, \nwithout further litigation, under circumstances where the liability issues are still \nvigorously contested among the Patiies to this litigation.  This Settlement provides Class \nMembers with a substantial monetary benefit. \nc.  This Settlement is clearly a product of hard-fought litigation between the \nParties, and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counselor Counsel for the \nDefendant. \nII.  Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendant their \napplication for reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses consistent with the terms \nof the Settlement Agreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request and \nhereby grants the request. \n12.  The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair, a \nsimplified process, and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work \nout any unanticipated problems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS \nOF FACT, THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS \nOF LAW: \n13.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Patiies and the subject matter of this \nproceeding. \n14.  Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following \nSettlement Class is certified for purposes of final settlement: \nSettlement Class: \nAll  persons  who  were  placed  into  the  custody  of  the \nPhiladelphia  Prison  System  after  being  charged  with \n4 \n\nmisdemeanors;  summary  offenses;  traffic  infractions,  civil \ncommitments,  or  other  minor  crimes;  or  bench  warrants \nand/or probation violations where the underlying charge was a \nmisdemeanor,  summary  offense  or other minor  crime;  and \nwho  were  strip  searched  in  the  absence  of  reasonable \nsuspicion upon their entry into the Philadelphia Prison System \npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Philadelphia \nPrison System and the City of Philadelphia. The class period \ncommences on April 21, 2003  and extends to, and includes, \nOctober 9, 2007. \nSubclass I: \nAll persons in the Settlement Class, EXCEPT for persons who \n(1) were charged with certain violence, dmg and/or weapons \n(hereinafter \"VDW\") related misdemeanor charges at the time \nof their admission, or (2) were charged with bench warrants \nand/or probation violations where the underlying charge was a \nVDW  misdemeanor  charge,  or  (3)  had  convictions  for \nfelonies and/or VDW misdemeanor charges predating the date \nof their admission. \nSubclass II: \nAll  persons  in  the  Settlement Class  who  were  (1)  charged \nwith  VDW  misdemeanor  charges  at  the  time  of  their \nadmission, or (2)  were charged with bench warrants and/or \nprobation violations where the underlying charge was a VDW \nmisdemeanor  charge,  or  (3)  had  convictions  for  felonies \nand/or VDW misdemeanor charges predating the date of their \nadmission. \n15.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule \n23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a class action is an \nappropriate method for resolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for \nclass certification under Rule 23 are present.  The Class Members are ascertainable and \ntoo numerous to be joined.  Questions of law and fact common to all Class Members \npredominate over individual issues and should be determined in one proceeding with \nrespect to all Class members.  The Class Representatives claims are typical of those of \nthe Class.  The Class action mechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating \n5 \n\nand resolving this action. \n16.  The  Settlement  Class  Representatives,  Nakisha  Boone  and  George  Byrd,  are \nentitled to  and are hereby awarded a payment of $15,000 each, in recognition of the \nefforts they undertook in connection with this  lawsuit.

Any unused monies will be donated to the Philadelphia Bar Foundation and \n18.  Class Counsel are qualified, experienced, and have aggressively litigated this \ncase, thereby demonstrating their adequacy as counsel for the Settlement Class.  Daniel \nC. Levin, Esquire of Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, Philadelphia, P A, Charles J. \nLaDuca, Esquire and Alexandra Wanen, Esquire of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, \nWashington, DC; Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire ofthe Law Offices of Elmer Robert \nKeach, III, Amsterdam, New York; and Gary E. Mason, Esquire and Nicholas A. \nMigliaccio, Esquire of the Mason Law Firm, LLP are hereby appointed as counsel for the \nSettlement Class. \n19.  The  COUli  grants  final  approval  of the  Settlement  Agreement,  as  being  fair, \nreasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n20.  The Courts finds that the request for attorneys' fees is reasonable. \n6 \n\nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS \nOF  FACT  AND  CONCLUSIONS  OF  LAW,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED, \nADJUDGED AND DECREED AS FOLLOWS: \n1.

McLaughlin \nUnited States District Judge \n8 \n\nCOURT ORDERED LEGAL NOTICE \nIf you were admitted into the Philadelphia Prison \nSystem between April 21, 2003 and October 9, 2007 \nand were strip searched upon admission, you could get \na payment from a class action settlement. \nA $5.9 million settlement has been proposed in a class action lawsuit about the strip \nsearch policies of the Philadelphia Prison System.  If you meet the criteria explained below, you \ncan share in this Settlement. \nThe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania authorized this \nnotice.  The Court will have a hearing to decide whether to approve the Settlement, so that the \nbenefits may be paid. \nWho's Included? \nYou are a Class Member and could get benefits if: \nI.  you entered the Philadelphia Prison System; AND \n2.  you were placed in the custody of the Philadelphia Prison System after being \ncharged with misdemeanors; summary offenses; traffic infractions; civil \ncommitments or other minor crimes; or bench warrants or probation violations \nwhere the underlying charge was a misdemeanor, summary offense or other \nminor crime; AND \n3.  you were strip searched upon entry to the Philadelphia Prison System without \nreasonable cause; AND \n4.  you were strip searched during the period of April 21, 2003 through October 9, 2007. \nWhat's This About? \nThe lawsuit claims that the Defendant City of Philadelphia unlawfully strip searched \nevelyone admitted into the Philadelphia Prison System on only minor charges.  The City of \nPhiladelphia has denied those claims.  The Court did not decide which side was right, but both \nsides agreed to the Settlement to ensure a resolution and to provide benefits to the people who \nwere affected.  -. \nWhat Does the Settlement Provide? \nDefendant agreed to pay a total of $5,900,000.00 to settle the case.  That will pay for the \nclaims of the Class Representatives, the administrative costs of the Settlement, an incentive \n\naward to the Class Representatives, and the attomeys' fees and expenses.  There are believed to \nbe approximately 37,000 Class Members.  You can only make one claim, even if you were strip \nsearched more than once.  Each Class Member who makes a claim will receive an equal share of \nthe pOltion of the Settlement Fund allocated to pay the claims of members of Subclass I or \nSubclass II, depending on which subclass you are a member of.  Class Counsel anticipates, based \non claims rates from other settlements, that all individuals who are members of Subclass I that \nmake a claim on the Settlement will receive between $600 and $900, as a settlement payment, \nand that all individuals who are members of Subclass II that make a claim on the Settlement will \nreceive between $50 and $100 as a settlement payment.  These amounts are dependent on how \nmany claims are received by the Claims Administrator during the claims period, and are subject \nto change based the number of claims received.  No amount is guaranteed. \nHow Do You Ask For A Payment? \nA detailed Notice and Claim Form package contains everything you need.  Just call 1-\n800-XXX-XXXX or visit the settlement website, XXXXXXX, to get one.  To qualifY for a \npayment, you must send in a Claim Form.  Claim forms are due by [insert date], 2009. \nWhat Are Your Other Options? \nIf you want to share in the Settlement, all you need to do is obtain a Claim Form, as just \nexplained, and retum it according to its directions.  If you don't want the Settlement benefits or \ndon't want to be legally bound by the Settlement, you must exclude yourself by [insert date] \n2009.  If you exclude yourself, you can't get any benefits from this Settlement, but you could \nbring a separate case against the Defendant, if you want to.  If you stay in the Settlement, you \nmay object to it by [insert date] 2009.  The detailed notice, available by calling or visiting the \nwebsite below, explains how to exclude yourself or object. \nThe court will hold a hearing in this case (Boone, et al.  v.  City ofP  hiladelphia, Case No. \n05-CV-1851) on [insert date], to consider whether to approve the Settlement and a request by \nthe lawyers representing all Class Members (Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, The Mason Law Firm, LLP, Washington, DC, The Law Offices of Elmer Robelt \nKeach, III, PC, Amsterdam, New York, and Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, Washington, DC; \nChristopher Hayes, The Law Office of Christopher G .Hayes, West Chester, P A; Kevin Birley, \nPhiladelphia, PA) for attomeys' fees and costs.
