Merin, filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in order to challenge the County Sheriff's policies and practices concerning the use of strip and visual body cavity searches in Santa Cruz County Jail.  Plaintiff, who was arrested on outstanding warrants for vehicle code violations, alleged that officers routinely subjected detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the detainees possessed contraband or weapons.  He alleged that such practices violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution as well as California state law.  To remedy the alleged violations, Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.</p><p>On July 2, 2008, the parties filed a settlement agreement.  Under the terms of the settlement, the defendants agree to pay $3,875,000 in damages to a class of parties who had been wrongfully strip-searched by the defendants.  Members of the plaintiff class would receive $1,250 if they had been wrongfully searched when booked for a misdemeanor, and they would receive $750 if they had been wrongfully searched when booked for a felony. They would receive an additional $500 if they were under 21 or over 60, had a physical or mental disability, or were pregnant at the time of the search. The settlement also covered attorneys fees and administrative costs of the settlement.</p><p>On January 28, 2009, the district court (Judge Jeremy Fogel) issued a final approval of the settlement and dismissed the case.</p><p></p>",

On or about October 18, 2006, PlaintiffDENNIS LEE BUTLER (herein after referred\n4 to as \"Plaintiff’) was arrested on warrants issued for vehicle code violations and transported to Santa\n5 Cruz County Jail where, prior to arraignment, he was striped naked and, after waiting several\n6 minutes during which time he was observed by multiple deputies, given clothing and taken with\n7 several other detainees to housing where, in the presence of other detainees, he was required to\n8 remove all of his clothes, bend over, spread his buttocks so that his anal area could be observed, then\n9 turn around and lift his penis and scrotum so that the area of his genitalia could be scrutinized.\n10 These procedures were performed, in a group so that Plaintiff could see and be seen by the other\n11 detainees similarly strip searched.\n12 11. Plaintiff was then placed in housing until it was time for him to go to Court to be\n13 arraigned at which time, prior to leaving housing, he was again subjected to a group strip search, this\n14 time in the presence of females, before being taken to Court at which he was ordered released on his\n15 own recognizance. Upon returning from Court, Plaintiff was again subjected to a group strip search\n16 and released from Santa Cruz County Jail.\n17 12. Within six (6) months of the strip searches described in the previous paragraph,\n18 Plaintiff filed a group government tort claim for himself and for all those persons similarly situated\n19 (a copy of said claim is attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\", and incorporated here into the extent relevant\n20 by this reference). Plaintiff’s group claim was rejected by operation of law on February 9, 2007,\n21 allowing the filing of this class action Complaint on state, statutory and constitutional grounds.\n22 13. Plaintiffis informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendants routineIy\n23 followed their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including\n24 Plaintiff, and all those he represents, to strip mad visual body cavity searches without first having,\n25 and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search will be productive of contraband\n26 and/or weapons. Plaintiff is further informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that Defendants\n27 routinely following their policy, practice, and custom of conducting the complained of searches in\n28 the presence of persons not officially participating in the searches; of conducting repetitive strip\nPage 5\nDENNIS BUTLER, (cid:128)~ al. vs. COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ, et al.

Defendant SANTA CRUZ COUNTY SHERIFF, STEVE ROBBINS, is personally\n5 responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom\n6 pursuant to which Plaintiff, and all those he represents, were subjected to strip searched in the\n7 manner described above.\n8 15. As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, Plaintiffand\n9 each of the persons similarly situated whom he purports to represents, suffered physical, mental, and\n10 emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and state and federal\n11 statutory and constitutional rights, and are entitled to recover damages, according to proof, and those\nI2 charged with misdemeanors, not involving violence, drugs or weapons, are entitled to recover\n13 damages, according to proof, but at a minimum $1,000 as specified in Califomia Penal Code §\n14 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and 52.1 (b); while those charged with\n15 felonies not involving violence, drugs or weapons are entitled to collect damages according to proof,\n16 as are those persons charged with offenses involving violence, drugs or weapons who could have\n17 been legally strip searched upon intake, but who were repeatedly strip searched, strip searched in\n18 groups, and/or strip searched after being OR’d or after their charges had been dismissed.\n19 CLASS CLAIMS\n20 16. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiff, and all those similarly\n21 situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of Defendants\n22 SANTA CRUZ COUNTY SHERIFF STEVE ROBBINS, SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, the individual\n23 SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 50, and the individuals whose\n24 names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES 1 through 20. The\n25 searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offenses\n26 for which Plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, had been arrested, without regard to whether or\n27 not Plaintiff, or those he represents, was eligible for cite and release under Penal Code § 853.6,\n28 without regard to whether or not Plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, was eligible for\nPage 6\nDENNIS BUTLER, ~t al. vs. COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ. et ~d, USDC, Northern District, San lo~e Division, Ca~e\nCLASS ACTION COMt’LAINT\n\n’= :ase 5:07-cv-OO941,JF Document 1-1 Filed 02/14/2007 Page 7 of 16\n1 and/or was released on his orher own recognizance. Furthermore, the searches complained of herein\n2 were performed without Defendants having a reasonable belief that the Plaintiff, or any of those\n3 similarly situated, so searched possessed weapons or contraband, and those facts being articulated\n4 and recorded in a supervisor-approved document. In addition, the searches complained of herein\n5 were repetitive without any reasonable belief that the Plaintiff, or those person similarly situated\n6 whom he represents, had acquired contraband following the prior strip search. Furthermore, the\n7 searches complained of herein were performed without Defendants taking reasonable precautions\n8 to ensure that Plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, was searched in an area affording\n9 privacy and was not observed by others not participating in the search but, to the contrary, were, in\n10 fact, performed in groups and when going to and returning from Court, performed in places where\n11 Plaintiff, and others similarly situated, could be and were view by members of the opposite sex.\n12 17. Plaintiff brings this action on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n13 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n14 18. The Class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including two\n15 (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the\n16 practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and or\n17 visual body cavity search at the Santa Cruz County Jail without Defendants first having, and\n18 recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or\n19 weapons. This class includes persons who were arrested on felonies and/or misdemeanors or\n20 infractions. The class includes all persons who were subjected to repetitive strip searches with no\n21 reasonable suspicion to believe that the detainees searched had acquired contraband subsequent to\n22 the prior search. The class also includes all those persons who were subjected to pre-arraignment\n23 strip and/or visual body cavity searches in the presence of persons who were not officially\n24 participating in such searches and/or those who were searched in places where they could be and\n25 were visualized bymembers of the opposite sex. Finally, the class includes all persons strip searched\n26 upon returning from Court after they were released on their own recognizance and/or the charges\n27 against them were dismissed.\n28\nDENNIS BUTLER, ctal. vs. COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ, et al.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 (a), the members of the\n2 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical. Plaintiffdoes not know the exact\n3 number of class members. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are\n4 more than 40 persons per day who are arrested by Defendants and/or in the custody of Defendants\n5 who are subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of Defendants’ policy, practice,\n6 and custom relating to said searches.\n7 20. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 (a), Plaintiffis informed\n8 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact common to the class\n9 including, but not limited to: (1) whether Defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual\n10 body cavity searches prior to arraignment whether or not they intend such persons to be housed in\n11 the SANTA CRUZ County Jail; (2) whether Defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to\n12 visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in the\n13 SANTA CRUZ County Jail; (3) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity\n14 searches prior to arraignment without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or\n1.5 articulable facts, to believe that any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or\n16 contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a strip and/or visual body cavity\n17 search; (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy\n18 so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches; (5) whether the\n19 strip and/or visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups; (6) whether the strip and/or visual\n20 body cavity searches are performed on detainees following their return from Court at which they\n21 have been ordered released on their own recognizance and/or their cases have been dismissed; (7)\n22 whether the strip and/or visual cavity searches are reasonably related to Defendants’ penological\n23 interest to maintain the security of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for\n24 protecting any such interest; and (8) whether repetitive strip and/or visual body cavity searches are\n25 performed without an intervening opportunity for the detainees to receive contraband.\n26 21. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 (a), Plaintiffis informed\n27 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law common to the class\n28 including, but not limited to: (1) whether Defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity\nP~e8\nDENNIS BUTLER, et zl. vs, COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ, et al.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n22 representative Plaintiffis typical of the class. Plaintiffwas searched, prior to arraignment, without\n23 reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or\n24 contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-\n25 approved writing). Representative Plaintiff has the same interests and suffered the same type of\n26 injuries as all of the class members. Plaintiff’s claims arose because of Defendants’ policy, practice,\n27 and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches before arraignment\n28 without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive\nPage 9\nDENNIS BUTLER, et al. vs, COLrNTY OF SANTA CRUZ, et at.

Furthermore, Plaintiff’s claims include claims of repetitive strip searches\n2 and being strip searched following return from Court after he had been ordered released on his own\n3 recognizance. These are claims common to other members of the class or sub-class of those whom\n4 Plaintiff seeks to represent. Each class member suffered actual damages as a result of being\n5 subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search. The actual damages suffered by the\n6 representative Plaintiff is similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by each class\n7 member.\n8 23. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n9 Plaintiffwitl fairly and adequately protect the class interests. Plaintiff’s interests are consistent with\n10 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class, even though not each member of the class will,\n11 necessarily, have been strip searched under all of the policies complained of herein or be in the sub-\n12 class of persons entitled to damages under Penal Code § 4030 and/or Civil Code § 52 and 52.1.\n13 24. hi accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 (b)(1)(A), prosecutions\n14 of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or\n15 varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible\n16 standards of conduct for the parties opposing the Complaint.\n17 25. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions\n18 of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent\n19 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter,\n20 substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their\n21 interests.\n22 26. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiff is\n23 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendants have acted on grounds generally\n24 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n25 respect to the class as a whole.\n26 27. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action\n27 is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy\n28 between the parties. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the interests of\n]’age 1 e.\nDENNIS BUTLER, et al. vs. COLrNTY OF SANTA CRUZ, et al.

Plaintiff also is\n3 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small\n4 that separate suits would be impracticable. Plaintiffis informed and believes, and thereupon alleges,\n5 that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them. Plaintiff is\n6 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one\n7 forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., the SANTA CRUZ County Jail. It\n8 will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather\n9 than in multiple Courts.\n10 28. Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members. Plaintiff is\n11 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the identities of the class members may be\n12 ascertained lYom records maintained by SANTA CRUZ COUNTY and Defendant SANTA CRUZ\n13 COUNTY SHERIFF STEVE ROBBINS and the Defendants’ Sheriff’s Department. Plaintiff is\n14 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendants’ records reflect the identities,\n15 including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody ha the\n16. SANTA CRUZ County Jail. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records\n17 of and maintained by Defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity search,\n18 when the search or searches occurred, where the search or searches occurred, whether any reasonable\n19 suspicion for such search existed and was recorded in a supervisor-approved writing, whether the\n20 search was conducted in a group, when persons searched were arraigned, and the charges on which\n21 such persons were arrested. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that all of the\n22 foregoing information is contained in Defendants’ computer system and that the information\n23 necessary to identify the class members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their\n24 arrests and/or release from custody, is readily available from said computer system.\n25 29. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(2)(b), class members\n26 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual\n27 notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.

One\n22 objector, Ms. Rita Kramer, appeared telephonically after having submitted a detailed objection to\n23 the settlement via facsimile on January 15, 2009. The Clerk of the Court is directed to file the\n24 objection.\n25 Ms. Kramer does not appear to object to the substance of the settlement but rather\n26 complains that she was deprived unfairly of the opportunity to be a named class representative.\n27\n28 1 This disposition is not designated for publication in the official reports.\nCase No. C 07-00941 JF (RS)\nORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT ETC.\n(JFEX2)\n\nCase5:07-cv-00941-JF   Document39    Filed01/28/09   Page2 of 3\n1 She claims that it was she who first brought the case to the attention of class counsel Mark\n2 Merin, and that Mr. Merin thereafter prosecuted the case for his own advantage, naming Dennis\n3 Butler as the only representative plaintiff and excluding her. She also accuses Mr. Merin of\n4 preparing the paperwork for her to opt in as a claimant in the class action without her consent. \n5 Ms. Kramer’s objections relate solely to her attorney-client interactions with Mr. Merin.\n6 Because the objections do not relate to the substance of the settlement, they do not weigh against\n7 approval of the settlement. Given that Ms. Kramer is the only objector, and because the Court\n8 concludes that the settlement is fair and adequate and in the best interest of the class, the Court\n9 will grant the motion for final approval.\n10 With respect to the motion for approval of stipulated attorneys’ fees and reimbursement\n11 of costs, the Court concludes that the requested fees and costs are fair and reasonable and are\n12 well-documented by the parties’ submissions.  Accordingly, the Court will grant that motion as\n13 well.\n14 Because Ms. Kramer stated unequivocally in the record that she did not wish to be a part\n15 of the class and did not wish to participate in the settlement, she is hereby excluded from the\n16 settlement class. Ms. Kramer is advised to consult with an attorney regarding her interactions\n17 with Mr. Merin in the event she wishes to pursue her concerns further.\n18 ORDER\n19 For good cause shown, it is hereby ordered that:\n20 (1) the motion for final approval of settlement is GRANTED;\n21 (2) the motion for approval of stipulated attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of costs is\nGRANTED; \n22\n(3) the Clerk of the Court shall file the objection of Ms. Kramer submitted to\n23 chambers on January 15, 2009; and \n24 (4) a separate order and judgment of dismissal shall be filed concurrently herewith.\n25\n26 DATED: January 28, 2009\n27                                                        \nJEREMY FOGEL\n28 United States District Judge\n2\nCase No. C 07-00941 JF (RS)\nORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT ETC.\n(JFEX2)\n\nCase5:07-cv-00941-JF   Document39    Filed01/28/09   Page3 of 3\n1 Copies of Order served on:\n2\nJason Michael Heath Jason.Heath@co.santa-cruz.ca.us, csl026@co.santa-cruz.ca.us \n3\nMark E.

As to paragraphs 1 through 11 related to Plaintiffs’ requests for relief, purported \n10 damages and requests for same, Defendants deny that Plaintiffs have been injured due to any \n11 conduct or failure to act by County of Santa Cruz or any of its agents and employees and deny that \n12 Plaintiffs are entitled to any relief. \n13 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES \n14 As a FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that the Complaint fails to \n15 state a claim for relief for violation of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §1983, California Penal Code \n16 § 4030, the Bane Civil Rights Act or any other claim asserted by Plaintiffs. \n17 As a SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants, at all times alleged in the \n18 Complaint, acted in a good faith belief that their actions were reasonable under the circumstances, \n19 did not violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and therefore, Defendants and/or their agents and \n20 employees are entitled to absolute and/or qualified immunity.  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 \n21 (1982); Mazor v. Shelton, 637 F.Supp. 330 (N.D. Cal. 1986); Babcock v. Tyler, 884 F.2d 497 (9th \n22 Cir. 1989); Cal. Government Code §§ 820.2, 821.6. \n23 As a THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs, by their own \n24 conduct, induced and negligently and/or intentionally caused and brought about the conduct of \n25 which they complain. \n26 As a FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that the Complaint fails to \n27 state a claim for relief for punitive damages. \n28\nButler v. County of Santa Cruz, et al., Case No. C070941                                      ANSWER TO COMPLAINT    \n-4- \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00941-JF     Document 4      Filed 03/09/2007     Page 5 of 7\n \n1 As a FIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs assumed the \n2 risk of their conduct, and, therefore, are barred from pursuing this Complaint. \n3 As a SIXTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs’ claims are \n4 barred by all applicable statutes of limitation, including but not limited to, the Government Tort \n5 Claims Act and/or Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5, 1094.6. \n6 As a SEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs’ Complaint \n7 fails to state a cause of action for which relief can be granted. \n8 As an EIGHTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs and/or other \n9 third parties solely caused Plaintiffs’ damages, if any exist, not these answering Defendants. Civil \n10 Code § 1431 et seq.  Any potential liability imputed to these Defendants should be reduced \n11 comparatively to their percentage of fault. \n12 As a NINTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs’ claims are \n13 barred by the equitable doctrines of estoppel, laches and unclean hands. \n14 As a TENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that at no time did \n15 Defendants breach any mandatory legal duty owed to Plaintiffs the proximate cause of which was \n16 Plaintiffs’ alleged injury and/or damages. \n17 As an ELEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that because Plaintiffs \n18 have drafted their Complaint in conclusive terms, this Defendant cannot fully anticipate all available \n19 affirmative defenses that may be applicable to the within action.  Accordingly, this answering \n20 Defendant hereby reserves the right to add additional affirmative defenses to the extent such \n21 affirmative defenses are applicable to the within action. \n22 As a TWELFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs’ claims \n23 should be barred or significantly reduced due to their failure to mitigate their damages, if any exist. \n24 As a THIRTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that their alleged \n25 conduct and/or failure to act is protected by all applicable governmental immunities pursuant to \n26 California Government Code §§ 810 et seq. \n27\n28\nButler v.

Civil Code § 47 et \n6 seq. \n7 As a SIXTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that none of their \n8 agents and/or employees engaged in any interference, or attempts to interfere, by threats, \n9 intimidation, violence or coercion with Plaintiffs’ exercise or enjoyment of their constitutional \n10 rights. \n11 As a SEVENTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that the complaint \n12 is barred because Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. \n13 As an EIGHTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that the complaint \n14 is barred because the issues it is based on, or a necessary portion of them, are not ripe for \n15 adjudication. \n16 As a NINETEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that the complaint \n17 fails to state a federal civil rights claim under the doctrine announced in Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. \n18 Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  \n19 As a TWENTIETEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that to the \n20 extent the Sheriff was acting as a state officer while performing state law enforcement duties, \n21 Defendants are immune from suit pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. \n22 As a TWENTY-FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE, Defendants allege that no class of \n23 similarly situated persons exists in this action and allege that Plaintiff cannot meet the prerequisites \n24 enumerated in FRCP 23. \n25 DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \n26   Jury trial is demanded on behalf of Defendants. \n27 /// \n28\nButler v. County of Santa Cruz, et al., Case No. C070941                                      ANSWER TO COMPLAINT    \n-6- \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00941-JF     Document 4      Filed 03/09/2007     Page 7 of 7\n \n1 WHEREFORE, Defendants request: \n2 a.

This waiver will include a \nwaiver of the provisions of California Civil Code §1542, which provides that “a general release does not extend to claims which the \ncreditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially \naffected his settlement with the debtor.”  By participating, you will be giving up unsuspected claims in the areas covered by the \nlitigation. \n \n2.  Exclude Yourself From the Class. \n \nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called “excluding” yourself. If you exclude \nyourself, you cannot get a payment and you cannot object to the Settlement.  Any Court orders will not apply to you.  To exclude \nyourself, you must sign a request for exclusion letter that states that you want to be excluded from Butler, et al. v. County of Santa \nCruz, et al., Case No. C 07-00941 JF.  Your exclusion letter must be mailed and postmarked before December 18, 2008, to: Butler v. \nCounty of Santa Cruz Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 8060, San Rafael, CA 94912-8060. \n \nIf you do not follow these instructions properly, you will lose your right to exclude yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you cannot get \nany money from the Settlement and you cannot tell the Court you do not like the Settlement (which is called “objecting”).
