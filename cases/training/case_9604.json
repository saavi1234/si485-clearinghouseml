    "summary": "<p>On July 13, 2006, two individuals, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action lawsuit against Defendants Allegheny County in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, challenging the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections' policy and practice of strip-searching all individuals entering Allegheny County Jail (ACJ) who were placed in jail clothing, regardless of their criminal charge and without reasonable suspicion to believe they were concealing a weapon or contraband. Plaintiffs, through private counsel, filed their complaint on behalf of themselves and a purported class of thousands of others who were strip searched at ACJ after having been charged with minor criminal offenses. </p><p>Plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages for themselves and all class members, as well as a declaratory judgment that Allegheny County's former policy and practice on strip searches was unconstitutional. Defendants answered the plaintiffs' complaint by requesting that the court either dismiss the case or grant the defendants summary judgment. The case was assigned to District Judge Terrence F. McVerry, who referred it to Magistrate Judge Robert C. Mitchell.  Magistrate Mitchell recommended that the defendants' motion to dismiss be denied.  District Judge McVerry adopted the recommendation and denied Defendants' motion to dismiss.  Delandro v. County of Allegheny, 2007 WL 81061 (W.D.Pa. Jan 08, 2007). </p><p>On November 30, 2007, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and class certification. In their motion for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the defendants from illegally strip-searching all pretrial detainees entering custody at ACJ in the absence of individualized reasonable suspicion. And in an Order dated March 18, 2008, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. </p><p>Upon the completion of discovery, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of the constitutionality of the strip-search policy. The defendants responded to the plaintiffs' motion and filed their own motion for summary judgment, arguing in part that the search policy was justified by ACJ's need for security and safety. Defendants further sought summary judgment for those claims directed at the individually named defendants brought in their official capacity. On December 2, 2009, the Court granted the plaintiffs' partial motion for summary judgment of liability as to the County, and granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the individual defendants. Following that order, the parties engaged in settlement negotiations, which ultimately resulted in a settlement agreement.</p><p>The settlement agreement recognized that the County had changed its policy to stop strip-searching all pretrial detainees on a blanket basis and to stop strip-searching misdemeanor detainees in the absence of reasonable suspicion of a weapon or contraband. The settlement agreement required all correction officers to have access to the policy and be trained on proper search policy. The settlement agreement also created a fund of three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) to compensate class members, and dictated that $18,000.00 will be requested for each of the two (2) class representatives. The Settlement Agreement provides that each class member who submits a timely claim form will be granted a pro rata share of the settlement fund in an amount not to exceed $3,000.00 per class member. Any undistributed funds will be donated to Neighborhood Legal Services Association of Allegheny County, PA.</p><p></p>",

The Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections has had a uniform practice and \nprocedure of strip searching all individuals who enter the Allegheny County Jail and are placed \n  1\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 2 of 20\nin jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon which they are charged. Upon information and \nbelief, this uniform practice and procedure is, in part, derived from the written procedures of the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections, and was promulgated by senior Bureau of Corrections \nofficials; specifically, Defendants Ramon C. Rustin, Edward D. Urban, Gregory E. Grogan, \nLance E. Bohn, and William L. Emerick. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals charged \nwith  misdemeanors  or  summary  violations  cannot  be  strip-searched  absent  particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband. In short, the uniform practice and procedure \nof Allegheny County and the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections to force those charged \nwith minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Allegheny \nCounty Jail is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.  \nPlaintiffs Harry Delandro, and Karen Murphy bring this action on behalf of themselves, \nand on behalf of a Class of thousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with \npetty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their civil rights and those of the \nClass Members they propose to represent. Plaintiffs were charged with non-felony offenses, and \nwere subjected to strip searches in violation of their rights against unreasonable searches under \nthe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for \nthemselves  and  each  Member  of  the  Proposed  Class,  a  declaration  that  the  Bureau  of \nCorrections’ uniform practices and procedures are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding \nAllegheny County and the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections from continuing to violate \n  2\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 3 of 20\nthe rights of those placed into their custody. With this as a background, Plaintiffs Harry Delandro \nand Karen Murphy complain as follows: \n \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983. \nThis Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is \nfiled to obtain declaratory relief relative to the Constitutionality of the policies of a local \ngovernment. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiffs’ claims and those of Proposed Class Members occurred in this judicial district. \n \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Harry Delandro (“Delandro”) is an adult male individual who resides at \n4517 Coleridge Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15201. On or about April 19, 2006, Delandro \nwas arrested and placed in the Allegheny County Jail on charges of failing to pay child support.  \n4.  Plaintiff Karen Murphy (“Murphy”) is an adult female individual who resides at \n3225 Orleans Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15214.

Collectively, Warden Rustin, Deputy Warden Urban, Deputy Warden Grogan, \nDeputy Warden Bohn, and Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick will be referred to as the “Policy \nMaking Defendants.” \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a Class of similarly situated individuals \n  6\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 7 of 20\nwho were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry \ninto the Allegheny County Jail. \n14.  The Class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll  persons  who  have  been  or  will  be  placed  into  the  custody  of  the \nAllegheny County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, summary \noffenses,  violations  of  probation  or  parole,  traffic  infractions,  civil \ncommitments or other minor crimes and were or will be strip searched upon \ntheir entry into the Allegheny County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom \nand practice of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections and the County \nof Allegheny. The Class Period commences on July 13, 2004, and extends \nto the date on which Defendants are enjoined from or otherwise cease \nenforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice or custom of conducting \nstrip searches absent reasonable suspicion. Specifically excluded from the \nClass are Defendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.  \n \n15.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a Class Action \nunder  Federal  law  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and  adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a Class Action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n16.  The Members of the Class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Jail every month -- all of whom are Members of \nthe Proposed Class. Upon information and belief, the size of the Proposed Class totals at least \n5,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions. \n17.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of Proposed Class Members and the fact that Class Members are \nlikely dispersed over a large geographical area, with some Members presently residing outside of \nAllegheny County and this Judicial District. Furthermore, upon information and belief, many \n  7\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 8 of 20\nMembers of the Class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have \ngreat difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n18.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’ conducting \nstrip searches absent particularized suspicion. All Members of the Class were charged with \nmisdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Jail, and all were illegally strip \nsearched in violation of the established law in this judicial circuit. \n19.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the Members of the Class. Plaintiffs \nand all Members of the Class sustained damages arising out of Defendants course of conduct. \nThe harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the Class Members. \n20.  The Representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the Members of the Class. \n21.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of Class Action and civil rights litigation. In short, Plaintiffs’ counsel has the \nresources,  expertise  and  experience  to  successfully  prosecute  this  action  against  Allegheny \nCounty,  the  Allegheny  County  Bureau  of  Corrections  and  the  Policy  Making  Defendants. \nCounsel for the Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among Members of the Class or between counsel \nand Members of the Class. \n22.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, the Plaintiffs \nseek Class Certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Class Members were subject to \n  8\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 9 of 20\nthe same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged with misdemeanor or \nminor crimes and placed into the custody of the Jail. In short, the County of Allegheny, the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections, the Policy Making Defendants and Jail Officers acted \non grounds generally applicable to all Class Members. \n23.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiffs \nseek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).  \n24.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual Members of the Class. These common \nquestions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate question of \nwhether the Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy of strip searching all individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Jail is a violation of the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de \nfacto policy existed during the Class Period. \n25.  A Class Action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual Members of the Class is \nimpracticable given the large number of Class Members and the fact that they are dispersed over \na large geographical area. Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual Members of the Class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem. The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would be \nenormous. Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and \nthe court system. By contrast, the conduct of this action as a Class Action in this District presents \n  9\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 10 of 20\nfar fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, \nand protects the rights of each Member of the Class. \n26.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals. \n27.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial Certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n28.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they supervise, \nfrom performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other \nminor  crimes,  unless  the  officer  has  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  arrestee  is \nconcealing a weapon or contraband. \n29.  Upon information and belief, the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County \nBureau of Corrections, and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the \nAllegheny County Correctional Facility and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature \nof their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the \nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 11 of 20\n30.  Upon information and belief, the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County \nBureau of Corrections and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of \nthe vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Allegheny County \nJail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime. For purposes \nof this Second Amended Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to \nas (“strip searches”). \n31.  The County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, and the \nPolicy Making Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a \npolicy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion. \nUpon information and belief, the Allegheny County Jail's written policy was based on the policy \npromulgated by the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections. \n32.  The Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been promulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n33.  Reasonable  suspicion  to  conduct  a  strip  search  may  only  emanate  from  the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the \nparticular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n34.  Upon information and belief, the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County \nBureau  of  Corrections,  and  Policy  Making  Defendants  have  promulgated,  implemented, \nenforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip \n  11\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 12 of 20\nsearching all individuals placed into the custody of the Allegheny Jail and placed into jail \nclothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort. This \nwritten and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the \nnature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a \nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine \nstrip searches.  \n35.  Pursuant  to  this  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  each  Member  of  the  Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiffs, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the \nAllegheny County Jail. These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of \nreasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion. Strip searches are \nconducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other  innocuous  offenses,  Driving  While \nIntoxicated, Harassment, Trespassing and Failure to Pay Child Support. \n36.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches -- each Member \nof the Class, including the named Plaintiffs -- has suffered or will suffer psychological pain, \nhumiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \n37.  Plaintiff Harry Delandro is an adult male. On or about Wednesday, April 19, \n2006, at approximately 9:00 p.m., he was arrested in his home on non-felony charges for failing \nto pay child support.  \n  12\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 13 of 20\n38.  At  the  time  of  his  arrest,  Delandro  was  on  crutches  and  wearing  a  foot \nimmobilizer.  \n39.  Delandro’s arrest was void of any reasonable suspicion that the harbored any \nweapons or contraband.  \n40.  Delandro was put in a holding cell for the night. The following morning and \nbefore having seen a judge, Delandro was provided with jail issue clothes and strip searched. \nDelandro was required to remove his underwear and lift his testicles in connection with this \nsearch.  \n41.  The next day at approximately 5:00 a.m., Delandro was taken back to processing \nso that he could get dressed and then go to Court.  \n42.  Delandro saw a hearing officer that afternoon, who ordered that he be released.  \n43.  Thereafter, Delandro returned to the Jail, was put in another holding cell, strip \nsearched yet again, and finally released at about 6:00 p.m. that evening.  \n44.  In connection with the second strip search, Delandro was required to completely \ndisrobe, lift up his testicles, bend over and cough, so that he could be visually inspected by a \ncorrectional officer.  \n45.  Delandro was able to observe other individuals being strip searched while he was \nwaiting for his turn to be searched.  \n46.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted pursuant \nto County and Bureau of Corrections’ policy, practice and custom, Delandro has suffered, and \ncontinues to suffer, psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.  \n  13\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 14 of 20\n47.  Plaintiff Karen Murphy is an adult female.  \n48.  On or about August 25, 2005 Ms. Murphy was arrested after placing a call to 911 \noperators requesting that the police be sent to her elderly father’s home to check on him. \n49.  At the time of the arrest Murphy was wearing only her underwear and a t-shirt. \n50.  After initial booking into the facility, Murphy was put in a holding cell where she \nremained for several hours.  \n51.  She was, thereafter, strip searched during the course of a supervised shower. \n52.  Murphy was required to completely disrobe, lift her breasts, squat, and manipulate \nher genital areas so that she could be visually inspected by the female guard.  \n53.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted pursuant \nto County and Bureau of Corrections’ policy, practice and custom, Murphy has suffered, and \ncontinues to suffer, psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law  \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law -- \n \n54.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 53. \n55.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \n  14\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 15 of 20\nsearches  of  individuals  arrested  for  misdemeanors  or  other  minor  crimes  absent  some \nparticularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n56.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nUnited States Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Jail Officers to strip \nsearch Plaintiffs and Class Members based on their arrests for minor criminal charges. It was \nalso not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making Defendants to order/direct Allegheny \nCounty Corrections Officers to conduct such searches.  \n57.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of \nthe County of Allegheny and the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections. As such, the County \nof Allegheny is directly liable for the damages of Plaintiffs and Members of the Class. \n58.  Upon information and belief, Sheriff DeFazio, Chief Deputy Mullen, Warden \nRustin, and Deputy Warden Urban are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to \nbe utilized in the operation of the Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of the strip \nsearch policy questioned in this lawsuit. As such, Warden Rustin, Deputy Warden Urban, \nDeputy Warden Grogan, Deputy Warden Bohn, and Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick are each \nindividually responsible for the damages of the Plaintiffs and Members of the Class.  \n59.  Warden Rustin, Deputy Warden Urban, Deputy Warden Grogan, Deputy Warden \nBohn, and Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick knew that the Jail’s strip search policy was illegal, \nand acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and Members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n  15\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 16 of 20\n60.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n61.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs and the Members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \n \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n   \n62.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 61. \n63.  The policy, custom and practice of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, \nthe County of Allegheny and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed \ninto the Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons. \n64.  Plaintiffs and Members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment,  and  that  it  declare  the  strip  search  policy  of  the  County  of  Allegheny  and  the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections to be unconstitutional. \n \n  16\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 17 of 20\nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n65.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 64. \n66.  The policy, custom and practice of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, \nthe County of Allegheny and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed \ninto the Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons. \n67.  Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Jail, with new \nand/or prospective Members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have already been \ninflicted upon the Plaintiffs.  \n68.  The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor crimes \nwill cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective Members of the Class, an adequate \nremedy for which does not exist at law. \n69.  Plaintiffs demand that the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County Bureau of \nCorrections,  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  and  Allegheny  County  Corrections  Officers \nimmediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of the Jail absent any \nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and \nseeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \n \n  17\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 18 of 20\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n70.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that \nthey continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy. \n71.  It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Allegheny and the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections have no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law. Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to \npunish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to them that the requirements of \nthe United States Constitution also apply to government officials in Allegheny County. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n72.  The Plaintiffs hereby demands a trial by jury. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Harry Delandro and Karen Murphy, on behalf of themselves \nand on behalf of a Class of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant them \nthe following relief: \n \n1.  An order certifying this action as a Class Action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23; \n \n2.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs’ \nFirst Cause of Action detailed herein, awarding Compensatory Damages \nto Plaintiff and each Member of the Proposed Class in an amount to be \ndetermined by a Jury and/or the Court; \n \n3.  A judgment against Defendant Ramon C. Rustin on Plaintiffs’ First Cause \nof Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages; \n  18\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 60    Filed 11/08/07   Page 19 of 20\n \n4.

A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the County of \nAllegheny  and  the  Allegheny  County  Bureau  of  Corrections’  policy, \npractice and custom of strip and visual cavity searching all detainees \nentering  the  Jail,  regardless  of  the  crime  charged  or  suspicion  of \ncontraband, to be unconstitutional and improper; \n \n9.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendants  from \ncontinuing  to  strip  and  visual  cavity  search  individuals  charged  with \nmisdemeanors or minor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion \nthat the arrestee subjected to the search is concealing weapons or other \ncontraband; and, \n \n10.

Wojcik, County\nSolicitor, and Craig E. Maravich, Assistant County Solicitor, and files the within Brief in Support\nof its Motion to Summary Judgment as follows:\nSynopsis\nThrough their Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the Allegheny County Jail\nhas a uniform practice and procedure of strip searching all individuals entering the Jail, including\nthose charged with misdemeanor or summary violations, whom Plaintiffs believe cannot be strip\nsearched absent “particularized suspicion that they possess weapons or contraband,” rising to the\nlevel of “unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.”\n(Second Amended Complaint, pp. 1-2).  Based on the facts of the case, Defendants are entitled to\nsummary judgment as a matter of law.\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 2 of 15\nStandard of Review\nSummary Judgment is appropriate “if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  FED.R.CIV.P. 56(c).  The inquiry\nis “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to the jury or\nwhether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.”  Anderson v. Liberty\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2504, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).  The moving party\nhas the burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of\nthe record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. V.\nCatrell, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).  Once the moving party\nmeets its burden, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and demonstrate specific\nfacts by the use of affidavits, depositions, or answers to interrogatories that a genuine issue\nexists.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324.  An issue is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary\nbasis on which a reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at\n249.  A factual dispute is material only if it might effect the outcome of the suit under governing\nlaw.  Id at 249.  At this juncture, a plaintiff cannot survive summary judgment based on “bald\nassertions” or “legal conclusions.”  Morse v. Lower Merion School District, 132 F.3d 902, 906\n(3rd Cir. 1997) (a plaintiff’s bald assertions will not survive a motion to dismiss); Fireman’s Ins.\nCo of Newark, N.J. v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d 965, 969 (3rd Cir. 1982) (a plaintiff will not survive\nsummary judgment by relying on bald assertions). \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 3 of 15\nArgument\nA. Defendants Rustin, Urban, Grogan, Bohn and Emerick \nmust be terminated as named in their official\ncapacity since the County of Allegheny is named\nas a Defendant.\nDefendants, Rustin, Urban, Grogan, Bohn and Emerick,  must be dismissed as named in\ntheir official capacity.  Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989) (“a\nsuit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather\nis a suit against the official’s office”).  Much like a sub-unit of the government, plaintiff cannot\nstate a claim against these defendants in their official capacity.  See Johnson v. City of Erie, 834\nF.Supp. 873 (W.D.Pa. 1993).\nA civil rights action against a defendant in his official capacity is only against the entity\nof which the officer is employed.  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 3099 (1985). \n“[A]n official capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the\nentity.”  Kentucky, 473 U.S. at 166; Brandon v. Holt, 469 U.S. 464, 105 S.Ct. 873 (1985). \n“Official-capacity suits, in contrast, generally represent only another way of pleading an action\nagainst an entity of which an officer is an agent.”  Kentucky, 473 U.S. at 165, citing, Monell v.\nNew York City Dept. Of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690, n.55, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035 n.55\n(1978).\nThe Complaint names Allegheny County as a defendant (see Pacer).  Much like a sub-\nunit, see Johnson v. City of Erie, 834 F.Supp. 873 (W.D.Pa. 1993), these Defendants must be\ndismissed and terminated from the case as named in their official capacity.  Kentucky v. Graham,\n473 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 3900 (1985).\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 4 of 15\nHence, Defendants, Rustin, Urban, Grogan, Bohn and Emerick must be dismissed and\nterminated from the case as named in their official capacity since the County of Allegheny is\nnamed as a Defendant.\nB. Under the Doctrine of Qualified Immunity,\nDefendants Rustin, Urban, Grogan, Bohn and\nEmerick, as named in their individual capacities,\nare immune from liability. \n  It has long been held that the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials\nfrom liability for damages “insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory\nor constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). This standard was clarified by the Supreme Court in Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635 (1987) wherein the Court held that whether a government official could\nbe held personally liable for conduct that allegedly violated a constitutional or statutory right\ndepended on the objective legal reasonableness of the action. Id. at 639.\nMost recently in Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808 (2009), the United States Supreme\nCourt revisited the issue of qualified immunity by abandoning the “mandatory, two-step rule”\nannounced in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 S. Ct. 2151 (2001) and adopted a less stringent,\ndiscretionary approval as to what prongs should be addressed by lower courts. Pearson v.\nCallahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 817 (2009).  See Newland v. Reehorst, 2009 WL 1295414, *2 (3d Cir.\n2009) (discussing Pearson and proceeding directly to whether the law was “clearly established”).\nIt is important to note that qualified immunity still remains a protection of a government\nofficial whether error was due to “a mistake of law, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on\nmixed questions of law and fact.” Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 815 (citing cases). Likewise, it remains\n“an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.” Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S.\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 5 of 15\n511, 526, 105 S. Ct. 2806 (1985). Finally, the issue of qualified immunity should be addressed\n“at the earliest possible stage in litigation.” Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S. Ct. 534\n(1991). \nUnder this standard, government officials are shielded from civil liability “as long as their\nactions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have\nviolated.” Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639. In Brown v. Grabowski, 922 F.2d 1097 (3d Cir. 1990),\ncert. denied., 501 U.S. 1218, 111 S. Ct. 2827, 115 L.Ed 2d 997 (1991), the Third Circuit\ninterpreted Anderson to require an analysis not only for the clear establishment of the right that\nan official is alleged to have violated, but also of the specific official actions alleged to have\nviolated the right.\n       In Curley v. Klem, 298 F.3d 271, 277 (3d Cir. 2002), the Third Circuit reviewed the\nanalytical frame work that courts should employ in determining whether qualified immunity is\napplicable to a given situation, stating:\n“[A] qualified immunity analysis must begin with this threshold question: \ndo the facts alleged, viewed in the light most favorable to the party \nasserting the injury, show that the officer’s conduct violated a \nconstitutional right? Saucier v. Katz, 121 S. Ct. at 2156. If the plaintiff \nfails to allege the violation of a constitutional right, no further inquiry is \nnecessary. If, however, the alleged facts show that there was a \nconstitutional violation, then the next step is to ask whether the right was \nclearly established. See Id. In other words, a court must consider \n“whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was \nunlawful in the situation he confronted.” Id. (citing Wilson v. Layne, 526 \nU.S. 603, 615, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed 2 818 (1999). This inquiry, the \nCourt noted, “must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the \ncase, not as a broad general proposition”  \nCurley, 278 F.3d at 277. \nThe determination of whether a right is “clearly established” has been explained by the\nSupreme Court as follows:\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 6 of 15\nFor a constitutional right to be clearly established, its contours “must be \nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he \nis doing violates that right.  This is not to say that an official action is \nprotected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has \npreviously been held unlawful, see Mitchell v. Forsyth, 473 U.S. 511, n. \n12, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed 2d 411; but it is to say that in the light of pre-\nexisting law the unlawfulness must be apparent”. Anderson v. Creighton, \n483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed 2d 523 (1987).\n \nHope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 2515 (2002). See also Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202\n(“The relevant dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether\nit would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he\nconfronted.”) \nAdditionally, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed the importance of resolving\nimmunity questions at the earliest possible status of a case. See, e.g., Saucier, 121 S. Ct. At 2156;\nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 646, n.6; Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818. “Qualified immunity is an entitlement\nnot to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.”  Bennett v. Murphy, 274 F.3d at 136\n(quoting Saucier, 121 S.Ct. At 2156); Doe v. Delie, 257 F.3d 309, 315 (3d Cir. 2001) (“this\npurely legal question permits courts expeditiously to weed out suits which fail the test without\nrequiring a defendant who rightly claims qualified immunity to engage in expensive and time\nconsuming preparation to defend the suit on its merits”).\nEven if the allegations are accepted in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, which is not\nrequired at this level in the proceedings, clearly established law did not exist at the time of the\nfiling of this action that Defendants violated the law, nor does it exist to date.  See Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1981 (1979) (holding strip search did not violate the Fourth\nAmendment); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding that practice of\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 7 of 15\nconducting strip search on all jail detainees being booked into general population did not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment).\nCertainly, the Allegheny County Jail search seems reasonable under the circumstances,\nsince not all arrestees are strip searched when entering the jail but only those detainees who\nreturn from the courthouse after arraignment, where they may have had contact with others, who\nalso did not make bond after intermingling with others, and are searched during the clothing\nexchange procedure in a private area at the showers just prior to being sent to general population. \nClearly established law does not make this unconstitutional.  See Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d\n1298 (11th Cir. 2008) (held that practice of conducting strip search on all detainees being booked\ninto general population did not violate Fourth Amendment); Stanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961 (7th\nCir. 2003) (held that observing the clothing exchange procedure of arrestee during jail admission\ndid not violate Fourth Amendment); Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955 (6th Cir.\n1987) (held that Fourth Amendment rights of arrestee charged with misdemeanor were not\nviolated when strip searched while awaiting the posting of bond and just prior to being moved\ninto the general jail population); Richerson v. Lexington Fayette Urban County Government, 958\nF.Supp. 299 (F.D.Kentucky 1996) (held that policy of strip searching all pretrial detainees upon\nreturn from the courtroom is reasonable).\nSince it would be appropriate to find that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,\nunder the “mandatory two-step rule” announced in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 S. Ct.\n2151 (2001), it holds that they are entitled to qualified immunity under the less stringent\napproach announced in Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808 (2009). Even if the Complaint was\nread in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, under these circumstances the defendants are\nentitled to Qualified Immunity. Qualified immunity gives room to an officer to “make a\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 8 of 15\nreasonable mistake about the legality of his actions.” DeLauri v. N.J. Div. of State Police, 2009\nWL 222983, *6 (D.N.J. 2009) (granting qualified immunity to police officers who observed\nwoman change her clothes with flashlights during arrest). Under the “mandatory two-step rule”\nannounced in Saucier v. Katz, the Defendants would be entitled to qualified immunity. It follows\nthen that they are entitled to Qualified Immunity under the less stringent approach recently\nannounced. Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 817 - 818.   Clearly established law does not say otherwise. \nSee Bell v. Wolfish, and Powell v. Barrett, supra.\n       In summary, it is respectfully requested that Defendants Rustin, Urban, Grogan, Bohn and\nEmerick are entitled to qualified immunity and summary judgment should be granted in their\nfavor.\nC. Defendant Allegheny County is entitled to \nsummary judgment based on the facts of\nthe case.\nA municipality may be held liable for a civil rights violation where conduct pursuant to\nits policy or custom causes a constitutional violation.  Monell v. Department of Social Services of\nthe City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978).  The complaint alleged that a policy or custom\nof Allegheny County violates a constitutional right but Plaintiffs do not demonstrate such.  See\nSmith v. Municipality of Lycoming County, 2006 WL 1793228 (M.D.Pa. 2006); Parent v. Roth,\n2001 WL 1243563 (E.D.Pa. 2001) (municipal liability not found where record evidence did not\nidentify policy or custom); Gagliardi v. County of Allegheny, 2007 WL 838971 (W.D.Pa. 2007)\n(County’s motion for summary judgment granted).\nIn the instant case, Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate any policy or custom which violates their\nconstitutional rights.  See Ludaway v. City of Jacksonville, 2007 WL 2455348 (11th Cir. 2007)\n(not published) (plaintiff “failed to identify any official policy that condones or promotes the use\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 9 of 15\nof excessive force”...and “failed to establish that there is a widespread custom of using excessive\nforce”); Carswell v. Borough of Homstead, 381 F.3d 235, 244 (3d Cir. 2004) (municipality\ncannot be vicariously liable and be liable only where the municipality “itself” caused the\nconstitutional violation).  In the civil rights arena, the burden is not on the government to prove\nthe validity of a regulation; instead the burden is on the prisoner to disprove it.  Overton v.\nBazzetta, 519 U.S. 126, 132, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 2168 (2003).\nThrough their Second Amended Complaint,1 Plaintiffs, Harry Delandro and Karen\nMurphy, bring a class action suit alleging that the Allegheny County Jail has a “uniform practice\nand procedure of strip searching all individuals who enter the Allegheny County Jail”...absent\n“particularized suspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.” (Second Amended\nComplaint, p. 1-2) (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs aver that this violates their constitutional rights,\nspecifically that they were subjected to “unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of\nthe United States Constitution” (Second Amended Complaint, p. 2).\nThe Second Amended Complaint identifies the Class it seeks to represent as follows:\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the\nAllegheny County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors,\nsummary offenses, violations of probation or parole, traffic\ninfractions, and commitments or other minor crimes and were or\nwill be strip searched upon their entry into the Allegheny County\nJail, pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of the Allegheny\nCounty Bureau of Corrections and the County of Allegheny.\n1Neither named Plaintiff, Harry Delandro nor Karen Murphy, appeared in the original complaint\nfiled on July 13, 2006. (Doc. #1).  The Original Complaint was brought by Michael Rey. (Doc. #1).  Rey\nwas terminated from the case on or about October 4, 2006 (see Pacer).  After class counsel engaged in\nsome plaintiff shopping, the First Amended Complaint was filed on behalf of Harry Delandro and Debra\nMalloy. Malloy was terminated from the case on or about November 9, 2007.  (See Pacer).  Once again,\nclass counsel engaged in some plaintiff shopping and filed on November 8, 2007 the Second Amended\nComplaint on behalf of Delandro and Murphy. (Doc. #60).\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 10 of 15\n(Second Amended Complaint, ¶14).\nAs a matter of law, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.  In the precedential\ncase of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979), the United States Supreme Court\nheld that strip searches of pretrial detainees were not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \nBell, 441 U.S. at 558 (“we do not believe that these searches are unreasonable”).  Additionally,\nthe Third Circuit found in Inmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Pierce,2 612 F.2d 754, 761 (3d\nCir. 1979):\nJail authorities may reasonably act so as to exclude contraband\nfrom the jail environment.  See Bell v. Wolfish, supra.  Thus, they\nmay prohibit contact visits, regulate the material received by\ninmates from outside the jail, or institute strip searches of inmates\nafter contact visits with non-inmates.\nNext, not every detainee who enters the Allegheny County Jail is uniformly strip\nsearched; instead, any detainee who enters the Allegheny County Jail is subjected to a frisk or pat\ndown search.  (Major Donis deposition, p. 13, ll 11-23; Cestra deposition, p. 31; p. 87 “No. No.\nNothing is removed at this point, no strip search. Nothing.”)  Only  in rare circumstances when\n“reasonable suspicion” exists is a strip search conducted at the entry stage.  (Major Donis\ndeposition, pp. 22-23; Cestra deposition, p. 87 (detainee is not forced to disrobe at entry).\nPlaintiffs ignore the facts of this case and the complex, multi-stage procedure of\naccepting detainees.  The system includes:\nStation 1\nIntake sally port\nAll newly arrested and detained persons entered into the institution for the first time.  A\npat down search is conducted.  Once this has been completed, the detainee is placed in a\nmetal detection scanner.  When the detainee has been cleared and secured, they are to be\nmoved to station 2.\n2Interestingly, class counsel, D. Aaron Rihn, is from the Pierce Law Offices operated by Robert\nPierce.  Robert Pierce was a named defendant in that case.\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 11 of 15\nStation 2\nGroup holding\nEach detainee is placed in a group holding cell or a single cell once a limited medical\nassessment has been conducted.  This assessment is administered by a member of the\nmedical department staff.\nStation 3\nCounty Identification Program\nA positive identification of the detainee is made and a check on any outstanding charges\nor warrants from other jurisdictions is made.\nStation 4\nPre-arraignment\nDetainees are placed in holding cells until scheduled to appear in front of an arraignment\njudge.\nNOTE: All detainees are escorted from the institution to the joining court building.  All\ndetainees are removed from the custody of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections\nand placed in the custody of the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Department.  Detainees may\nhave contact with others outside the Jail.  Once all court proceedings have been\ncompleted, they are placed back in the custody of the Allegheny County Bureau of\nCorrections and re-enter the institution.  Upon arraignment, a detainee may be released\nhaving never been strip searched.\nStation 5\nProcessing\nDetainees are placed in a common area with full access to telephones and vending\nmachines, and are free to interact with other detainees.  The detainee is given an ample\namount of time to arrange bond for release.  If that has failed, the detainee starts to be\nprocessed for incarceration into the institution and population.  Once again, a detainee\nmay be released at this stage having never been strip searched.\n \nStation 6\nThe detainee is now an inmate\nAll personal items and valuables are removed and inventoried.  A search of the inmate is\nconducted in a private area out of view of other inmates and staff.  All new inmates are\nordered to shower and dress in institutional clothing.  The inmate is now ready to enter\ngeneral inmate population for classification.\n(Major Donis Deposition, Exhibit B, p. 10)\nAdditionally, it is alleged that Harry Delandro was arrested and placed in the Allegheny\nCounty Jail on April 19, 2006 for failure to pay child support.  (Second Amended Complaint,\n¶23).  The allegations continue that Delandro “was on crutches and wearing a foot immobilizer.”\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 12 of 15\n(Second Amended Complaint, ¶38).  Delandro admits that this apparatus on his leg could be\nremoved and contained a “couple steel bars in it.” (Delandro deposition, p. 22).  Certainly, it is\nconceivable that crutches and steel bars could be used as weapons;  hence, a prison official\nshould not be second guessed that these could be contraband if used improperly and their mere\nexistence coming into the jail would jeopardize the safety and security of the institution. \nPertaining to Karen Murphy, the Second Amended Complaint alleged that she was\narrested and placed in the Allegheny County Jail on misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct\nand harassment.  (Second Amended Complaint, ¶9).  The Allegheny County Jail has no record of\nher in the Jail on that date. (Grogan Verification)\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979), the United States Supreme\nCourt held, inter alia, that the practice of visual body cavity searches or strip searches of pretrial\ndetainees did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the Untied States Constitution.  The Supreme\nCourt suggested direction to the lower courts that they should consider such factors as “the scope\nof the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it,\nand the place in which it is conducted.”  Id. At 559.  Never did the Supreme Court hold that a jail\nmust have “particularized reasonable suspicion” that a detainee has drugs or weapons in order to\nconduct a strip search, as Plaintiffs suggest.  (See Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law, p. 10).\nMost recently, the Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, held that the practice of conducting\nfull body visual strip searches on all jail detainees being booked into general population did not\nviolate the Fourth Amendment.  Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2008).  That\ndecision overruled the two previous decisions by the Eleventh Circuit in Wilson v. Jones, 251\nF.3d (11th Cir. 2001) and Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678 (11th Cir. 2000).\nLikewise, the Seventh Circuit held that visual inspection of the exposed body of an\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 13 of 15\narrestee during the clothing exchange procedure is part of the admission process into the jail was\nreasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Stanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961, 967 (7th\nCir. 2003).\nAdditionally, the Sixth Circuit has held that the Fourth Amendment rights of an arrestee\ncharged with a misdemeanor were not violated when the strip search occurred just before the\narrestee was to be moved into general population.  Dobrowolsky v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d\n955, 956 (6th Cir. 1987).  See also, Richerson v. Lexington Fayette Urban County Government,\n958 F.Supp. 299, 307 (E.D. Kentucky 1996) (“a policy of strip searching the detainees upon their\nreturn from the courthouse and prior to their being placed back in the general population of the\ndetention center is both justified and reasonable.”) The court reasoned that the “policy was not a\nblanket search of all detainees”....“but a more narrowly drawn policy of searching only those\ndetainees who were required by force of circumstances to be moved into the general jail\npopulation.”  Id. At 304.\nPertaining to the Allegheny County Jail and pretrial detainees, the Third Circuit has found\nthat “jail authorities may reasonably act so as to exclude contraband from the jail environment.” \nInmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754, 761 (3d Cir. 1979) (citing Bell v.\nWolfish, supra).  In that case, the Third Circuit said that Allegheny County Jail “may prohibit\ncontact visits, regulate the material received by inmates from outside the jail, or initiate strip\nsearches of inmates after contact visits with non-inmates.”  Id. at 761.  The Third Circuit has\nnever ruled that a jail is required to have particularized reasonable suspicion that a pretrial \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 112    Filed 05/26/09   Page 14 of 15\ndetainee has weapons or drugs in order to be strip searched.3\nFinally, persuasive authority suggests that summary judgment in favor of defendant is\nappropriate under the circumstances.  Powell, 541 F.3d at 1302 (policy of strip searching all jail\ndetainees did not violate the Fourth Amendment).  At the Allegheny County Jail, not all arrestees\nare strip searched upon entry; instead, only those that are about to be moved to general\npopulation, Dobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 959 (jail’s strip search policy was not of “all detainees”\nbut only those about “to be moved into the general jail population), as part of the showering and\nclothing exchange procedure, Stanley, 337 F.3d at 967, upon return from the courthouse and after\nfailing to make bond, see Richerson, 958 F.Supp. at 307, which is reasonably related to the\nlegitimate penological of order and security.  Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132, 123 S.Ct.\n2162 (2003), and related to the prevention of contraband into the institution.  Inmates of\nAllegheny County Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754, 761 (3d Cir. 1979).\nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\nbe granted.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Michael H.

Maravich\nAssistant County Solicitor\n3More recently, the Third Circuit in an unpublished opinion found that an inmate’s constitutional\nrights were not violated when strip searched per policy upon his reentry to the RHU, despite his claim\nthat the searches were conducted in a demeaning, humiliating manner for purposes of embarrassment and\nwere unsanitary since he was required to sweep his mouth with his finger after having been directed to\ntouch his genitals.

The Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections has had a uniform practice and \nprocedure of strip-searching all individuals who enter the Allegheny County Jail and are placed \nin jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon which they are charged.  Upon information and \nbelief, this uniform practice and procedure is, in part, derived from the written procedures of the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections, and was promulgated by senior Bureau of Corrections \nofficials; specifically, Defendants Ramon C. Rustin, Edward D. Urban, Gregory E. Grogan, \nLance E. Bohn, and William L. Emerick. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals charged \nwith  misdemeanors  or  summary  violations  cannot  be  strip-searched  absent  particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the uniform practice and procedure \nof Allegheny County and the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections to force those charged \nwith minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Allegheny \nCounty Jail is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.  \nPlaintiffs Harry Delandro and Debra Maloy bring this action on behalf of themselves, and \non behalf of a class of thousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with \npetty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their civil rights and those of the \nclass members they propose to represent.  Plaintiffs were charged with non-felony offenses and \nwere subjected to strip searches in violation of their rights against unreasonable searches under \nthe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for \n  2\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 3 of 20(cid:10)\nthemselves and each member of the proposed class, a declaration that the Bureau of Corrections’ \nuniform practices and procedures are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding Allegheny \nCounty and the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections from continuing to violate the rights of \nthose placed into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiffs Harry Delandro and Debra \nMaloy complain as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983.  \nThis Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is \nfiled  to  obtain  declaratory  relief  relative  to  the  Constitutionality  of  the  policies  of  a  local \ngovernment. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiffs’ claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n3.

Deputy Warden Urban is made a Defendant in this \naction in both his individual and official capacities. \n9.  Defendant Gregory E. Grogan (“Deputy Warden Grogan”) is the duly appointed \nDeputy Warden of the Allegheny County Jail, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the \ntreatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the Jail exercises custodial or other control.  \nDeputy Warden Grogan’s principal place of business is the Allegheny County Jail, 950 Second \nAvenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219.

Defendant Lance E. Bohn (“Deputy Warden Bohn”) is the duly appointed Deputy \nWarden of the Allegheny County Jail, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the \ntreatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the Jail exercises custodial or other control.  \nDeputy Warden Bohn’s principal place of business is the Allegheny County Jail, 950 Second \nAvenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219.  Deputy Warden Bohn is made a Defendant in this \naction in both his individual and official capacities. \n11.  Defendant William L. Emerick (“Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick”) is the duly \nappointed Assistant Deputy Warden of the Allegheny County Jail, and, as such, is a policy maker \nwith respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the Jail exercises \ncustodial or other control.  Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick’s principal place of business is the \nAllegheny County Jail, 950 Second Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219.  Assistant Deputy \nWarden Emerick is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official capacities. \n12.  Collectively, Warden Rustin, Deputy Warden Urban, Deputy Warden Grogan, \nDeputy Warden Bohn, and Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick will be referred to as the “Policy \nMaking Defendants.” \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals \nwho were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry \ninto the Allegheny County Jail. \n14.  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nAllegheny County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, summary \n  6\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 7 of 20(cid:10)\noffenses, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil \ncommitments or other minor crimes and were or will be strip searched upon \ntheir entry into the Allegheny County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom \nand practice of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections and the County \nof Allegheny.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any \nand all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, \nemployees or assignees.   \n \n15.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder  Federal  law  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and  adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n16.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  \nUpon  information  and  belief,  there  are  hundreds  of  people  arrested  for  misdemeanors  and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Jail every month -- all of whom are members of \nthe proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed class totals at least \n5,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions. \n17.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of class members and the fact that class members are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of \nAllegheny County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many \nmembers of the class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have \ngreat difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n18.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’ conducting \nstrip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were charged with \n  7\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 8 of 20(cid:10)\nmisdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Jail, and all were illegally strip \nsearched in violation of the established law in this judicial circuit. \n19.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiffs \nand all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants course of conduct.  \nThe harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n20.  The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n21.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  In short, Plaintiffs’ counsel has the \nresources,  expertise  and  experience  to  successfully  prosecute  this  action  against  Allegheny \nCounty,  the  Allegheny  County  Bureau  of  Corrections  and  the  Policy  Making  Defendants.  \nCounsel for the Plaintiffs knows of no conflicts among members of the class or between counsel \nand members of the class. \n22.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiffs \nseek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members were subject to \nthe same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged with misdemeanor or \nminor crimes and placed into the custody of the Jail.  In short, the County of Allegheny, the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections, the Policy Making Defendants and Jail Officers acted \non grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n23.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiffs \nseek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n  8\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 9 of 20(cid:10)\n24.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate  over  any  questions  that  affect  only  individual  members  of  the  Class.    These \ncommon questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion  of  whether  the  Defendants’  written  and/or  de  facto  policy  of  strip  searching  all \nindividuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Jail is a violation \nof the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a \nwritten and/or de facto policy existed during the class period. \n25.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the class is \nimpracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a \nlarge geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem.  The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would \nbe enormous.  Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties \nand the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District \npresents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court \nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n26.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals. \n27.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n  9\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 10 of 20(cid:10)\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n28.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they supervise, \nfrom performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other \nminor crimes unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing \na weapon or contraband. \n29.  Upon information and belief, the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County \nBureau of Corrections and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the \nAllegheny County Correctional Facility and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature \nof their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the \nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n30.  Upon information and belief, the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County \nBureau of Corrections and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of \nthe vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Allegheny County \nJail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime.  For \npurposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as (“strip \nsearches”). \n31.  The County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, and the \nPolicy Making Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a \n  10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 11 of 20(cid:10)\npolicy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion.  \nUpon information and belief, the Allegheny Police’s written policy was based on the policy \npromulgated by the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections. \n32.  The Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been promulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n33.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the \nparticular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n34.  Upon information and belief, the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County \nBureau of Corrections and Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, \nand/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Allegheny Jail and placed into jail clothing without any \nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de \nfacto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the \noffense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest \nwere relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches.   \n35.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiffs, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the \nAllegheny County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of \nreasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are \n  11\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 12 of 20(cid:10)\nconducted for individuals arrested for, among other innocuous offenses, Driving While \nIntoxicated, Harassment, Trespassing and Failure to Pay Child Support. \n36.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches -- each member \nof the class, including the named Plaintiff -- has suffered or will suffer psychological pain, \nhumiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \n37.  Plaintiff Harry Delandro is an adult male.  On or about Wednesday, April 19, \n2006, at approximately 9:00 pm, he was arrested in his home on non-felony charges for failing to \npay child support.   \n38.  At the time of his arrest, Delandro was on crutches and wearing a foot \nimmobilizer.   \n39.  Delandro’s arrest was void of any reasonable suspicion that the harbored any \nweapons or contraband.   \n40.  Delandro was put in a holding cell for the night.  The following morning and \nbefore having seen a judge, Delandro was provided with jail issue clothes and strip searched.  \nDelandro was required to remove his underwear and lift his testicles in connection with this \nsearch.   \n41.  The next day at approximately 5:00 am, Delandro was taken back to processing so \nthat he could get dressed and then go to Court.   \n42.  Delandro saw a hearing officer that afternoon, who ordered that he be released.   \n  12\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 13 of 20(cid:10)\n43.  Thereafter, Delandro returned to the Jail, was put in another holding cell, strip \nsearched yet again, and finally released at about 6:00 pm that evening.   \n44.  In connection with the second strip search, Delandro was required to completely \ndisrobe, lift up his testicles, bend over and cough, so that he could be visually inspected by a \ncorrectional officer.   \n45.  Delandro was able to observe other individuals being strip searched while he was \nwaiting for his turn to be searched.   \n46.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted pursuant \nto County and Bureau of Corrections’ policy, practice and custom, Delandro has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.  \n47.  Plaintiff Debra Maloy is a 37 year old female.  On or about February 23, 2006, at \napproximately 9:00 am, Maloy was arrested on non-felony counts of making false reports to a \nlaw enforcement officer, driving with a suspended license and careless driving.   \n48.  Maloy was arraigned by a magistrate judge following arrest and, after being \ndenied bail, was taken to the Allegheny County Jail.   \n49.  After being subjected to an initial search, Maloy was taken to a holding cell where \nshe remained for approximately seventeen hours.   \n50.  Maloy was strip searched the following day.   \n51.  During the course of the strip search Maloy was required to completely disrobe, \nremove a cranial prosthesis she wears as a result of a medical condition, move her breasts, squat, \nand manipulate her genital areas, so that she could be visually inspected by the guard.   \n  13\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 14 of 20(cid:10)\n52.  The search was conducted by a female guard but male detainees, as well as \nanother female detainee who was being strip searched next to Maloy, were in view of Maloy’s \nbody during the search.   \n53.  Maloy was released on her own recognizance by a judge six days after her arrest.   \n54.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted pursuant \nto County and Bureau of Corrections’ policy, practice and custom, Maloy has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law  \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law -- \n \n55.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 54. \n56.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \nsearches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or other minor crimes absent some \nparticularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n57.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Jail Officers to strip \nsearch Plaintiffs and Class members based on their arrests for minor criminal  charges.  It was \nalso not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making Defendants to order/direct Allegheny \nCounty Corrections Officers to conduct such searches.   \n  14\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 15 of 20(cid:10)\n58.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of \nthe County of Allegheny and the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections.  As such, the County \nof Allegheny is directly liable for the damages of Plaintiffs and members of the Class. \n59.  Upon information and belief, Sheriff DeFazio, Chief Deputy Mullen, Warden \nRustin, and Deputy Warden Urban are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to \nbe utilized in the operation of the Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of the strip \nsearch policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Warden Rustin, Deputy Warden Urban, \nDeputy Warden Grogan, Deputy Warden Bohn, and Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick are each \nindividually responsible for the damages of the Plaintiffs and members of the Class.    \n60.  Warden Rustin, Deputy Warden Urban, Deputy Warden Grogan, Deputy Warden \nBohn, and Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick knew that the Jail’s strip search policy was illegal, \nand acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n61.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n62.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above,  \nPlaintiffs and the members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n   \n63.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 62. \n  15\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 16 of 20(cid:10)\n64.  The policy, custom and practice of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, \nthe County of Allegheny and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed \ninto the Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons. \n65.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Allegheny and the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n66.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 65. \n67.  The policy, custom and practice of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, \nthe County of Allegheny and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed \ninto the Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons. \n68.  Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Jail, with new \nand/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have already been \ninflicted upon the Plaintiffs.   \n  16\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 17 of 20(cid:10)\n69.  The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor crimes \nwill cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, an adequate \nremedy for which does not exist at law. \n70.  Plaintiffs demand that the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County Bureau of \nCorrections, the Policy Making Defendants and Allegheny County Corrections Officers \nimmediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of the Jail absent any \nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and \nseeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n71.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that \nthey continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy. \n72.  It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Allegheny and the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections have no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to \npunish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to them that the requirements of \nthe United States Constitution also apply to government officials in Allegheny County. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n73.  The Plaintiffs hereby demands a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Harry Delandro and Debra Maloy, on behalf of themselves and \non behalf of a class of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the \nfollowing relief: \n \n  17\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 18 of 20(cid:10)\n1.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \n2.     A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs’ First Cause \nof Action detailed herein, awarding Compensatory Damages to Plaintiff and each member of the \nproposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury and/or the Court.  \n3.    A judgment against Defendant Ramon C. Rustin on Plaintiffs’ First Cause of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \n4.    A judgment against Defendant Edward D. Urban on Plaintiffs’ First Cause of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \n5.    A judgment against Defendant Gregory E. Grogan on Plaintiffs’ First Cause of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \n6.        A judgment against Defendant Lance E. Bohn on Plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action \nfor $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \n7.         A judgment against Defendant William L. Emerick on Plaintiffs’ First Cause of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \n8.       A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the County of Allegheny \nand the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections’ policy, practice and custom of strip and visual \ncavity searching all detainees entering the Jail, regardless of the crime charged or suspicion of \ncontraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \n9.    A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from continuing to \nstrip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the search is concealing \nweapons or other contraband. \n  18\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM-RCM     Document 7     Filed 10/03/2006     Page 19 of 20(cid:10)\n10.

The Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections has had a policy of strip-\n  1\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 2g eo f2 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\nsearching all individuals who enter the Allegheny County Jail and placing them in jail clothing, \nregardless of the crime with which they are charged. Upon information and belief, this policy is, \nin part, derived from the written procedures of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, and \nwas promulgated by senior Bureau of Corrections officials; specifically, Defendants Ramon C. \nRustin, Edward D. Urban, Gregory E. Grogan, Lance E. Bohn, and William L. Emerick. It has \nbeen  well  established  in  this  judicial  circuit  for  many  years  that  individuals  charged  with \nmisdemeanors or non-felony violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized suspicion \nthat they possess weapons or contraband. In short, the policy of Allegheny County and the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections to force those charged with minor crimes to undergo \nthe indignities of a strip-search upon entry into the Allegheny County Jail is not only clearly \nillegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.  \nPlaintiff Michael Rey brings this action on behalf of himself, and on behalf of a class of \nthousands of others who were strip-searched after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate \nthe clear and unnecessary violation of his civil rights and those of the Class Members he \nproposes to represent. Plaintiff was charged with a non-felony offense, and was subjected to a \nstrip-search, in violation of his right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment \nof the United States Constitution. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for himself, and for each \nmember  of  the  Proposed  Class;  a  declaration  that  the  Bureau  of  Corrections’  policies  are \nunconstitutional; and an injunction precluding Allegheny County and the Allegheny County \nBureau of Corrections from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody. \nWith this as a background, Plaintiff Michael Rey complains as follows: \n  2\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 3g eo f3 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\nJURISDICTION \n \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983. \nThis Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is \nfiled  to  obtain  declaratory  relief  relative  to  the  constitutionality  of  the  policies  of  a  local \ngovernment. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiff’s claims and those of Proposed Class Members occurred in this judicial district. \n \nPARTIES \n \n3.  Plaintiff  Michael  Rey  is  44  years  old  and  resides  at  333  Annabelle  Street, \nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15211.

The Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections (the “Bureau of Corrections”) is an \nentity organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with a \nprincipal  place  of  business  at  950  Second  Avenue,  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania  15219-3100. \nAlthough not a legal entity for the purposes of litigation, the Office is listed as a party for the \npurposes  of  identification.  At  all  times  relevant  hereto,  the  Bureau  of  Corrections  was \nresponsible for operating, organizing, overseeing and administering the Allegheny County Jail \n(the “Jail”). At all times relevant hereto, Defendant Bureau of Corrections, together with the \nCounty of Allegheny, was responsible for the polices, practices, supervision, implementation and \nconduct of all matters pertaining to the Jail, and was responsible for the appointment, training, \nsupervision and conduct of all Bureau of Corrections personnel, including those working in the \nJail. In addition, at all times relevant hereto, Defendant Bureau of Corrections, together with the \nCounty of Allegheny, was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Jail, and for ensuring that \nBureau of Corrections personnel employed in the Jail obeyed the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   \n  4\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 5g eo f5 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\n6.

Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure on behalf of himself and a Class of similarly situated individuals who \nwere charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip-searched upon their entry into \nthe Allegheny County Jail. \n13.  The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nAllegheny County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, \nsummary  offenses,  violations  of  probation  or  parole,  traffic \n  6\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 7g eo f7 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\ninfractions,  civil  commitments  or  other  minor  crimes  and  who \nwere or will be strip-searched upon their entry into the Allegheny \nCounty Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the \nAllegheny  County  Bureau  of  Corrections  and  the  County  of \nAllegheny. Specifically excluded from the Class are Defendants \nand any and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, \nheirs, successors, employees or assignees.  \n \n14.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a Class Action \nunder  Federal  law,  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a Class Action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n15.  The Members of the Class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  there  are  hundreds  of  people  arrested  for  misdemeanors  and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Jail every month -- all of whom are members of \nthe Proposed Class. Upon information and belief, the size of the Proposed Class totals at least \n5,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions. \n16.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of Class Members and the fact that Class Members are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of \nAllegheny County and this Judicial District. Furthermore, upon information and belief, many \nMembers of the Class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have \ngreat difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n17.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants conducting \nstrip-searches absent particularized suspicion. All Members of the Class were charged with \n  7\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 8g eo f8 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\nmisdemeanors or non-felony violations when placed into the custody of the Jail, and all were \nillegally strip-searched in violation of the established law in this judicial circuit. \n18.  Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the Members of the Class. Plaintiff \nand all Members of the Class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ course of conduct. \nThe harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the Class Members. \n19.  The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action, and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. Plaintiff has no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the Members of the Class. \n20.  Plaintiff has retained counsel who have substantial experience and success in the \nprosecution  of  class  action  and  civil  rights  litigation.  In  short,  Plaintiff’s  counsel  has  the \nresources,  expertise  and  experience  to  successfully  prosecute  this  action  against  Allegheny \nCounty,  the  Allegheny  County  Bureau  of  Corrections  and  the  Policy  Making  Defendants. \nCounsel for the Plaintiff knows of no conflicts among Members of the Class or between counsel \nand Members of the Class. \n21.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, the Plaintiff \nseeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Class Members were subject to \nthe same policy requiring the illegal strip-searches of individuals charged with misdemeanor or \nminor crimes and placed into the custody of the Jail. In short, the County of Allegheny, the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections, the Policy Making Defendants and Jail Officers acted \non grounds generally applicable to all Class Members. \n  8\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 9g eo f9 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\n22.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \nseeks certification under Rule 23(b)(3).  \n23.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual Members of the Class. These common \nquestions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate question of \nwhether the Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy of strip-searching all individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Jail is a violation of the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de \nfacto policy existed during the Class Period. \n24.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual Members of the Class is \nimpracticable given the large number of Class Members, and the fact that they are dispersed over \na large geographical area. Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual Members of the Class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem. The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would be \nenormous. Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and \nthe court system. By contrast, the conduct of this action as a Class Action in this District presents \nfar fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, \nand protects the rights of each Member of the Class. \n25.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals. \n  9\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 1g0e  o1f0 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\n26.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff also \nseeks partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n \n27.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they supervise, \nfrom performing strip-searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other \nminor crimes unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing \na weapon or contraband. \n28.  Upon information and belief, the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County \nBureau of Corrections and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of strip-searching all individuals who enter the custody of the \nAllegheny County Correctional Facility and who are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the \nnature of their charged crime, and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that \nthe individual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n29.  Upon information and belief, the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County \nBureau of Corrections and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of \nthe vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Allegheny County \n  10\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 1g1e  o1f1 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\nJail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime. For purposes \nof  this  Complaint,  strip  and  visual  cavity  searches  are  collectively  referred  to  as  (“strip-\nsearches”). \n30.  The County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, and the \nPolicy Making Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a \npolicy  or  practice  of  conducting  strip-searches  without  particularized,  reasonable  suspicion. \nUpon information and belief, the defendants' policy was based on the policy promulgated by the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections. \n31.  The Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale  strip-searches  of  all  misdemeanor  and  non-felony  violation  arrestees  has  been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n32.  Reasonable  suspicion  to  conduct  a  strip-search  may  only  emanate  from  the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the \nparticular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n33.  Upon information and belief, the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County \nBureau of Corrections and Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, \nand/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip-searching all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Allegheny Jail and placed into jail clothing without any \nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort. This written and/or de facto \npolicy made the strip-searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense \n  11\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 1g2e  o1f2 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\ncharged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were \nrelevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip-searches.  \n34.  Pursuant  to  this  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  each  Member  of  the  Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip-search upon their entry into the \nAllegheny County Jail. These searches were conducted without inquiry into, or establishment of, \nreasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion. Strip-searches are \nconducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other  innocuous  offenses,  Driving  While \nIntoxicated, Harassment, Trespassing and Failure to Pay Child Support. \n35.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip-searches -- each Member \nof the Class, including the named Plaintiff -- has suffered or will suffer psychological pain, \nhumiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n \n36.  Plaintiff Michael Rey is a 44 year old male. On or about February 13, 2006, he \nwas arrested on non-felony charges for failing to pay child support and, the following day was \ntransferred from a holding cell in the local courthouse to the Allegheny County Jail.  \n37.  Plaintiff’s  arrest  was  void  of  any  reasonable  suspicion  that  he  harbored  any \nweapons or contraband. \n  12\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 1g3e  o1f3 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\n38.  After  being  remanded  to  the  Allegheny  County  Jail,  Plaintiff  remained  in  a \nholding cell for 24 hours. Plaintiff was then brought into a shower room and advised by a \ncorrectional officer that he would be strip-searched. In connection with the strip-search, Plaintiff \nwas required to completely disrobe, lift his arms and legs, spread the lobes of his buttocks, lift up \nhis testicles and bend over, so that he could be visually inspected by a correctional officer. \nPlaintiff was then ordered to shower while a Corrections Officer was present. \n39.  Plaintiff was released from the Allegheny County Jail the following day, after his \nfamily was able to come up with the $5,000.00 fee required to purge his overdue child support \naccount. \n40.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted pursuant \nto County and Bureau of Corrections’ policy, practice and custom, Plaintiff has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law  \n \nUnreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal \nPolicies to Avoid Constitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law \n \n41.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and re-alleges each and every allegation stated \nin Paragraphs 1 through 40. \n  13\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 1g4e  o1f4 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\n42.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip-\nsearches  of  individuals  arrested  for  misdemeanors  or  other  minor  crimes  absent  some \nparticularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n43.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiff's rights under the \nUnited States Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Jail Officers to \nstrip-search Plaintiff and/or the Class Members based on their arrests for minor criminal charges. \nIt  was  also  not  objectively  reasonable  for  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  to  order/direct \nAllegheny County Corrections Officers to conduct such searches.  \n44.  These strip-searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of \nthe County of Allegheny and the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections. As such, the County \nof Allegheny is directly liable for the damages of Plaintiff and Members of the Class. \n45.  Upon information and belief, Warden Rustin, Deputy Warden Urban, Deputy \nWarden Grogan, Deputy Warden Bohn, and Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick are responsible \nfor establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Jail, and are \nresponsible for the implementation of the strip-search policy questioned in this lawsuit. As such, \nWarden Rustin, Deputy Warden Urban, Deputy Warden Grogan, Deputy Warden Bohn, and \nAssistant Deputy Warden Emerick are each individually responsible for the damages of the \nPlaintiff and Members of the Class.  \n46.  Warden Rustin, Deputy Warden Urban, Deputy Warden Grogan, Deputy Warden \nBohn, and Assistant Deputy Warden Emerick knew that the Jail’s strip-search policy was illegal, \n  14\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 1g5e  o1f5 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\nand acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff and Members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n47.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n48.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above,  \nPlaintiff and the Members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \n \nCOUNT II \nDemand for Declaratory Judgment \n \n   \n49.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and re-alleges each and every allegation stated \nin paragraphs 1 through 48. \n50.  The policy, custom and practice of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, \nthe County of Allegheny and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip-searches of all individuals placed \ninto the Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons. \n51.  Plaintiff and Members of the Class request that this Court issue a Declaratory \nJudgment,  and  that  it  declare  the  strip-search  policy  of  the  County  of  Allegheny  and  the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections to be unconstitutional. \n \n  15\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 1g6e  o1f6 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\nCOUNT III \nDemand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction \n \n52.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and re-alleges each and every allegation stated \nin Paragraphs 1 through 51. \n53.  The policy, custom and practice of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections, \nthe County of Allegheny, and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip-searches of all individuals placed \ninto the Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons. \n54.  Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Jail, with new \nand/or prospective Members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have already been \ninflicted upon the Class Representative.  \n55.  The continuing pattern of strip-searching individuals charged with minor crimes \nwill cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective Members of the Class, an adequate \nremedy for which does not exist at law. \n56.  Plaintiff demands that the County of Allegheny, the Allegheny County Bureau of \nCorrections,  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  and  Allegheny  County  Corrections  Officers \nimmediately desist from strip-searching individuals placed into the custody of the Jail absent any \nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and \nseeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \n  16\n\nCasCea 2s:e0 62-:c0v5--0m0c9-2072-0T2F5M   - R DCoMc u  m  Denotc 1u4m9e9n-1t  1  - 1 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 1037//21030/260  0  6 P   a  gPea 1g7e  o1f7 2 o0f(cid:10) 20(cid:10)\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n \n57.  The actions of the Policy Making Defendants detailed herein are outrageous in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip-search policy. \n58.  It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Allegheny and the \nAllegheny County Bureau of Corrections have no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law. Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to \npunish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to them that the requirements of \nthe United States Constitution also apply to government officials in Allegheny County. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n \n59.  The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Michael Rey, on behalf of himself and on behalf of a class of \nothers similarly situated, requests that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \n \n1.

ZACHARIA, ESQ. and moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' \nComplaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12 (b)(6) and/or \nRule 56, averring in support thereof as follows: \n \nPlaintiff’s Allegations \nIn their Complaint, Plaintiffs’ seek damages and injunctive relief alleging \nthat the County of Allegheny and its officers of the County Jail employ a policy \nwhereby the officials conduct strip searches of individuals arrested for innocuous \noffenses.  The Complaint makes a wholesale, blanket statement that the conduct \nstrip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion and that strip \nsearches take place regardless of the offense. (Complaint ¶30-31) \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 4    Filed 09/11/06   Page 2 of 4\nSuccinctly stated, Plaintiffs seek to change the law in this Circuit to the \neffect that, if Plaintiffs had their way, no strip search may take place of any \nincarcerated individual if that person is incarcerated for a crime of less than a \nfelony. \nFor the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed \nwith prejudice. \n  The seminal case in this issue is Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  \nThere  the Supreme Court held that invasive body searches of pretrial detainees \ndoes not violate the Fourth Amendment as long as the searches are related to a \nlegitimate goal or interest. 441 U.S. at 538. See also Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 \nF.Supp. 772, 787 (E.D.Pa.1993). The balancing test requires that courts weigh \nthe need for the particular strip search against the invasion of personal rights that \nthe search entails. Bell, 441 U.S. at 539. Important factors for the court to \nconsider include the level of intrusion, the manner in which the search was \nconducted, the justification for the search, and the place where the search was \nperformed. Id. Moreover, blanket strip searches, without a reasonable and \nparticularized suspicion, violate a pretrial detainee's due process rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment. Id. Searches must be conducted in a professional and \nreasonable manner. Id. at 560. \nIn this Circuit, the closest authority on the issue is Wilson v. Shannon, 982 \nF.Supp. 337 (E.D. Pa 1997).  There, the Court held; “An inmate has some \nconstitutional protection under the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable \nsearches, but an inmate's rights are limited by the need to maintain prison \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 4    Filed 09/11/06   Page 3 of 4\nsecurity, and by the inmate's own reduced expectation of privacy.” Citing Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884-85, (1979). \n  Defendants attach hereto as Exhibits, the Policy of the Allegheny County \nJail as it applies to strip searches and sentencing record of named Plaintiff \nMichael Rey showing that he was convicted of Contempt of Court.  As shown in \nthe Policy, any individual who is convicted and sentenced to the Jail shall be strip \nsearched.   \n  This policy is well within the allowable ambit of the Constitution and the \nCounty’s need in maintaining security by prohibiting any individual who enters \ninto the general population from being strip searched.  It is not difficult to imagine \na cottage industry developing whereby persons intentionally commit minor \noffenses, and, knowing that they cannot be strip searched enter into the general \npopulation carrying contraband for sale. \nThe law of this Circuit, as stated above, is simply that a strip search must \nbe reasonable in the furtherance of a legitimate goal or interest and to maintain \nprison security.  The Policy of the County, promulgated in April 2000 attached as \nan Exhibit hereto falls squarely within the constitutionally permitted protections \nfor both the individual and the citizens of the County.  \nWHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request this Honorable Court to \ndismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint, with prejudice. \nRespectfully submitted, \nMichael H.

Wojcik, County\nSolicitor, and Craig E. Maravich, Assistant County Solicitor, and files the within Response to\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as follows:\nIntroduction\nThrough their Second Amended Complaint,1 Plaintiffs, Harry Delandro and Karen Murphy,\nbring a class action suit alleging that the Allegheny County Jail has a “uniform practice and\nprocedure  of  strip  searching  all  individuals  who  enter  the  Allegheny  County  Jail”...absent\n“particularized suspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.” (Second Amended Complaint,\np. 1-2) (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs aver that this violates their constitutional rights, specifically that\n1Neither named Plaintiff, Harry Delandro nor Karen Murphy, appeared in the original complaint\nfiled on July 13, 2006. (Doc. #1).  The Original Complaint was brought by Michael Rey. (Doc. #1).  Rey\nwas terminated from the case on or about October 4, 2006 (see Pacer).  After class counsel engaged in\nsome plaintiff shopping, the First Amended Complaint was filed on behalf of Harry Delandro and Debra\nMalloy. Malloy was terminated from the case on or about November 9, 2007.  (See Pacer).  Once again,\nclass counsel engaged in some plaintiff shopping and filed on November 8, 2007 the Second Amended\nComplaint on behalf of Delandro and Murphy. (Doc. #60).\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 109    Filed 05/26/09   Page 2 of 8\nthey were subjected to “unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution (Second Amended Complaint, p. 2).\nThe Second Amended Complaint identifies the Class it seeks to represent as follows:\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the\nAllegheny County Jail  after being charged with misdemeanors,\nsummary  offenses,  violations  of  probation  or  parole,  traffic\ninfractions, and commitments or other minor crimes and were or will\nbe strip searched upon their entry into the Allegheny County Jail,\npursuant to the policy, custom or practice of the Allegheny County\nBureau of Corrections and the County of Allegheny.\n(Second Amended Complaint, ¶14).\nFirst, contrary to Plaintiffs’ representations, not every detainee who enters the Allegheny\nCounty Jail is uniformly strip searched; instead, any detainee who enters the Allegheny County Jail\nis subjected to a frisk or pat down search.  (Major Donis deposition, p. 13, ll 11-23; Cestra\ndeposition, p. 31; p. 87 “No. No. Nothing is removed at this point, no strip search. Nothing.”)  Only\nin rare circumstances when “reasonable suspicion” exists is a strip search conducted at the entry\nstage.  (Major Donis  deposition, pp. 22-23; Cestra deposition, p. 87 (detainee is not forced to\ndisrobe at entry).  Hence, a genuine issue of material fact exists precluding summary judgment on\nbehalf of Plaintiff.  (Doc. #7).  \nAdditionally, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment.  Plaintiffs\nfail to cite to any controlling law which says otherwise.  The only precedential case cited by\nPlaintiffs is Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979) and in that case the United States\nSupreme Court held that strip searches of pretrial detainees were not unreasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 558 (“we do not believe that these searches are unreasonable”).\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 109    Filed 05/26/09   Page 3 of 8\nAdditionally, the Third Circuit found in Inmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Pierce,2 612 F.2d 754,\n761 (3d Cir. 1979):\nJail authorities may reasonably act so as to exclude contraband from\nthe jail environment.  See Bell v. Wolfish, supra.  Thus, they may\nprohibit contact visits, regulate the material received by inmates from\noutside the jail, or institute strip searches of inmates after contact\nvisits with non-inmates.\nA. The County does not admit to having an illegal blanket\nstrip search policy and practice\nPlaintiffs continuously misstate the facts in an attempt to support their allegations that all\ndetainees are strip  searched upon entry into the Allegheny County Jail. (Second Amended\nComplaint, p. 7).  Simply stated, this is factually inaccurate and Defendants do not admit to having\nan illegal blanket strip search policy and procedure.  Clearly, a genuine issue as to material facts\nexists which precludes summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs.\nFirst, contrary to Plaintiffs’ representations, not every detainee who enters the Allegheny\nCounty Jail is uniformly strip searched; instead, any detainee who enters the Allegheny County Jail\nis subjected to a frisk or pat down search.  (Major Donis deposition, p. 13, ll 11-23; Cestra\ndeposition, p. 31; p. 87 “No. No. Nothing is removed at this point, no strip search. Nothing.”)  Only\nin rare circumstances when “reasonable suspicion” exists is a strip search conducted at the entry\nstage.  (Major Donis deposition, pp. 22-23; Cestra deposition, p. 87 (detainee is not forced to disrobe\nat entry).\nPlaintiffs ignore the facts of this case and the complex, multi-stage procedure of accepting\ndetainees.  The system includes:\n2Interestingly, class counsel, D. Aaron Rihn, is from the Pierce Law Offices operated by Robert\nPierce.  Robert Pierce was a named defendant in that case.\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 109    Filed 05/26/09   Page 4 of 8\nStation 1\nIntake sally port\nAll newly arrested and detained persons entered into the institution for the first time.  A pat\ndown search is conducted.  Once this has been completed, the detainee is placed in a metal\ndetection scanner.  When the detainee has been cleared and secured, they are to be moved\nto station 2.\nStation 2\nGroup holding\nEach detainee is placed in a group holding cell or a single cell once a limited medical\nassessment has been conducted.  This assessment is administered by a member of the\nmedical department staff.\nStation 3\nCounty Identification Program\nA positive identification of the detainee is made and a check on any outstanding charges or\nwarrants from other jurisdictions is made.\nStation 4\nPre-arraignment\nDetainees are placed in holding cells until scheduled to appear in front of an arraignment\njudge.\nNOTE: All detainees are escorted from the institution to the joining court building.  All\ndetainees are removed from the custody of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections and\nplaced in the custody of the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Department.  Detainees may have\ncontact with others outside the Jail.  Once all court proceedings have been completed, they\nare placed back in the custody of the Allegheny County Bureau of Corrections and re-enter\nthe institution.  Upon arraignment, a detainee may be released having never been strip\nsearched.\nStation 5\nProcessing\nDetainees are placed in a common area with full access to telephones and vending machines,\nand are free to interact with other detainees.  The detainee is given an ample amount of time\nto arrange bond for release.  If that has failed, the detainee starts to be processed for\nincarceration into the institution and population.  Once again, a detainee may be released at\nthis stage having never been strip searched.\nStation 6\nThe detainee is now an inmate\nAll personal items and valuables are removed and inventoried.  A search of the inmate is\nconducted in a private area out of view of other inmates and staff.  All new inmates are\nordered to shower and dress in institutional clothing.  The inmate is now ready to enter\ngeneral inmate population for classification.\n(Major Donis deposition, Exhibit B, p. 10)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 109    Filed 05/26/09   Page 5 of 8\nB. Facts Relevant to the Named Plaintiffs, Harry Delandro\nand Karen Murphy.\nIn the Second Amended Complaint, it is alleged that Harry Delandro was arrested and placed\nin the Allegheny County Jail on April 19, 2006 for failure to pay child support.  (Second Amended\nComplaint, ¶23).  The allegations continue that Delandro “was on crutches and wearing a foot\nimmobilizer.” (Second Amended Complaint, ¶38).  Delandro admits that this apparatus on his leg\ncould be removed and contained a “couple steel bars in it.” (Delandro deposition, p. 22).  Certainly,\nit is conceivable that crutches and steel bars could be used as weapons;  hence, a prison official\nshould not be second guessed that these could be contraband if used improperly and their mere\nexistence coming into the jail would jeopardize the safety and security of the institution.  Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979) (prison officials must be “accorded wide-ranging\ndeference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed\nto preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”)  Read in the light\nmost favorable to the non-moving party, Delandro is not entitled to summary judgment.  In fact,\nDelandro is not entitled to recovery since in the prison environment he was attempting to bring in\npotentially dangerous weapons.\nPertaining to Karen Murphy, the Second Amended Complaint alleged that she was arrested\nand placed in the Allegheny County Jail on misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and\nharassment on or about August 25, 2005.  (Second Amended Complaint, ¶4).  The Allegheny County\nJail has no record of her in the Jail on that date. (Grogan Verification)\nCOUNTER ARGUMENT\nFirst, almost in passing, Plaintiffs argue that this Court’s determination to deny a Motion to\nDismiss sets the “law of the case” that “plaintiffs have stated a viable claim that the defendants\nviolated their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches” (Doc. #108).  This\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 109    Filed 05/26/09   Page 6 of 8\nargument must be rejected if meant to suggest any more than the Court read the allegations contained\nin the Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs as the Court must at the Motion to Dismiss\nstage and allowed the case to proceed into discovery.  See Lloyd v. City of Bethlehem, 2004 WL\n540452, *9 (E.D.Pa. 2004) (because the summary judgment stage of a proceeding is a different stage\nof the proceeding than a motion to dismiss, the Court found “unpersuasive” plaintiff’s contention\nthat the “law of the case” was set by an Order denying a motion to dismiss).\nPrecedential law and persuasive law have held that the practice\nof conducting strip searches of pretrial detainees does not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979), the United States Supreme Court\nheld, inter alia, that the practice of visual body cavity searches or strip searches of pretrial detainees\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment of the Untied States Constitution.  When considering such\na practice, the Supreme Court suggested direction to the lower courts that they should consider such\nfactors as “the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification\nfor initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.”  Id. At 559.  Never did the Supreme Court\nhold that a jail must have “particularized reasonable suspicion” that a detainee has drugs or weapons\nin order to conduct a strip search, as Plaintiffs suggest.  (See Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law, p. 10).\nMost recently, the Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, held that the practice of conducting full\nbody visual strip searches on all jail detainees being booked into general population did not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment.  Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2008).  That decision\noverruled the two previous decisions by the Eleventh Circuit in Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th\nCir. 2001) and Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678 (11th Cir. 2000).\nLikewise, the Seventh Circuit held that visual inspection of the exposed body of an arrestee\nduring the clothing exchange procedure as part of the admission process into the jail was reasonable\nand did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Stanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961, 967 (7th Cir. 2003).\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 109    Filed 05/26/09   Page 7 of 8\nAdditionally, the Sixth Circuit has held that the Fourth Amendment rights of an arrestee\ncharged with a misdemeanor were not violated when the strip search occurred just before the arrestee\nwas to be moved into general population.  Dobrowolskyj  v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 956 (6th\nCir. 1987).  See also, Richerson v. Lexington Fayette Urban County Government, 958 F.Supp. 299,\n307 (E.D. Kentucky 1996) (“a policy of strip searching the detainees upon their return from the\ncourthouse and prior to their being placed back in the general population of the detention center is\nboth justified and reasonable”). The court reasoned that the “policy was not a blanket search of all\ndetainees”....“but a more narrowly drawn policy of searching only those detainees who were required\nby force of circumstances to be moved into the general jail population.”  Id. At 304.\nConcerning the case at hand, controlling, precedential law has held that the practice of visual\nbody cavity searches or strip searches of pretrail detainees did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 558.  Under the circumstances, precedential law directs that plaintiffs are not\nentitled to summary judgment.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 556.\nOn the contrary, persuasive authority suggests that summary judgment in favor of defendant\nis appropriate under the circumstances.  Powell, 541 F.3d at 1302 (policy of strip searching all jail\ndetainees did not violate the Fourth Amendment).  At the Allegheny County Jail, not all arrestees\nare strip searched upon entry; instead, only those that are about to be moved to general population,\nDobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 959 (jail’s strip search policy was not of “all detainees” but only those\nabout “to be moved into the general jail population), as a part of the showering and clothing\nexchange procedure, Stanley, 337 F.3d at 967, upon return from the courthouse and after failing to\nmake bond.  See Richerson, 958 F.Supp. at 307.\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 109    Filed 05/26/09   Page 8 of 8\nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment be\ndenied.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Michael H.

We have appellate \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and review the District Court’s June 1, 2012, order \nfor abuse of discretion.  See Klier v. Elf Atochem N. Am., Inc., 658 F.3d 468, 474 (5th \nCir. 2011); In re Airline Ticket Comm’n Antitrust Litig., 307 F.3d 679, 682 (8th Cir. \n2002).  After a careful review of the record, we discern no error in the District Court’s \n\nCaseC: 1a2s-e2 28:5046 -  c v D-0o0c9u2m7e-TnFt: M00  3 D1o1c1u1m77e6n8t 61 9  9   P  aFgileed:  20 3  / 2  0D/a1t3e   F Pilaegde:  022 o/2f 62/2013\ndecision to approve class counsel’s request to distribute the residual settlement funds to \nthe cy pres beneficiary, which is in accord with the terms of the parties’ settlement \nagreement.

Feb. 19, 2013) (“cy pres distributions are most appropriate where further \nindividual distributions are economically infeasible”).  Appellant’s objections to the cy \npres distribution are untimely and unsupported.  Consequently, we hereby summarily \naffirm the District Court’s order because this appeal presents no substantial question.  See \n3d Cir.

After a fairness hearing conducted on March 1, 2011, the Court\nwill grant these motions and will enter final judgment and an order of dismissal.\nBackground\nA. Factual and Procedural History\nOn November 8, 2007, plaintiffs Harry Delandro and Karen Murphy, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, filed\na second amended class action complaint against Defendants Allegheny County and the following officials of the Allegheny\nCounty Jail (“ACJ”): Warden Ramon Rustin, Deputy Wardens Edward Urban, Gregory Grogan, and Lance Bohn, and Assistant\n1\nDeputy Warden William Emerick.  Plaintiffs complain that Defendants violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures for having been subjected to strip searches at ACJ after being charged with non-felony\noffenses pursuant to a policy or practice promulgated by Allegheny County.\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 1\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\n1 Plaintiffs filed their first class action complaint on July 13, 2006. The first amended class action complaint was filed on October 3,\n2006. The individually named Defendants were dismissed from this action on December 2, 2009, and removed from the caption.\nSee Doc. No. 125.\nPrior to March 18, 2008, the ACJ had a policy and practice of strip searching all individuals entering ACJ who were placed in\njail clothing, regardless of their criminal charge and without reasonable suspicion to believe they were concealing a weapon or\ncontraband (hereinafter, Allegheny County's “former policy”). The former policy was said to be derived from written procedures\nof the ACJ and promulgated by the individual Defendants. To vindicate the alleged violation of their Fourth Amendment right\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures based on the former policy, Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on behalf\nof themselves and a purported class of thousands of others who were strip searched at ACJ after having been charged with minor\ncriminal offenses. Plaintiffs contend that Allegheny County's former policy on uniform strip searches violated their civil rights.\nPlaintiffs contend that on April 19, 2006, Harry Delandro was arrested in his home on a non-felony charge for failing to pay\nchild support; that at the time of his arrest, Delandro was on crutches and wearing a foot mobilizer, and his arrest lacked any\nreasonable suspicion that he harbored weapons or contraband; that he was placed in a holding cell at ACJ for the night, and the\nfollowing morning, he was provided with jail clothes and strip searched; and that the next day, he was taken to processing so\nhe could prepare to go to court, after which he saw a hearing officer who ordered that he be released. Upon returning to ACJ,\nhe was put in a holding cell where he was able to observe other individuals being strip searched while he waited for his turn\nto be strip searched; and that he was again strip searched.\n*2 Plaintiffs also contend that on August 25, 2005, Karen Murphy was arrested on misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct\nand harassment after placing a 911 call to operators requesting that police be sent to her father's home to check on him; that\nat the time of her arrest, Ms. Murphy was wearing only her underwear and a tee shirt; that after she was booked into ACJ,\nMurphy was put in a holding cell were she remained for several hours; and that she was later strip searched during the course\nof a supervised shower.\nIn the second amended complaint, Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages for themselves and all class members, as\nwell as a declaratory judgment that Allegheny County's former policy and practice on strip searches was unconstitutional. On\nNovember 30, 2007, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and class certification. Doc. Nos. 65 & 66. In their motion for\na preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the Defendants from illegally strip-searching all pretrial detainees entering\ncustody at ACJ in the absence of individualized reasonable suspicion. Id. In an Order dated March 18, 2008, and with the\nconsent of the parties, this Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Doc. No. 85.\nIn an Order dated August 8, 2008, this Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for class certification, and the Class was defined as:\nAll persons who have been incarcerated at the Allegheny County Jail commencing on July 13, 2004 and continuing to March\n18, 2008 who, after being charged but not convicted of misdemeanors, summary offenses, civil commitments, and traffic\ninfractions as defined by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as well as parole or probations violations where\nthe underlying offense is a misdemeanor, summary offense or traffic infraction who, pursuant to the policy of Allegheny\nCounty, have been strip searched upon their entry into the Allegheny County Jail without reasonable suspicion.\nDoc. No. 99. The Court notes that the Settlement Agreement between the parties that Plaintiffs now seek to have approved\ncontains the same definition of the Class. Doc. No. 151.\nThe parties engaged in extensive discovery. Upon the completion of which, on April 24, 2009 Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial\nsummary judgment on the issue of the constitutionality of the strip-search policy. Doc. No. 107. In support of their motion,\nPlaintiffs produced deposition testimony which confirmed that during the Class period, Defendants maintained a practice of\nconducting blanket strip and visual cavity searches on all pretrial detainees who were given a jail uniform and processed into\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\nthe jail's general population without individualized reasonable suspicion that they possessed a weapon or contraband. See Doc.\nNo. 108 at pp. 2–5, citing the deposition testimony of the County's Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b) (6) designee.\nDefendants responded to Plaintiffs' motion a month later (Doc. No. 109) and filed their own motion for summary judgment\n(Doc. No. 111), to which Plaintiffs responded (Doc. No. 116). Defendants argued in part that the search policy was justified\nby ACJ's need for security and safety. They maintained that the policy was necessary to prevent detainees from smuggling\ncontraband into the jail. See Doc. No. 112 at. They also argued that the searches were reasonable. Defendants further sought\nsummary judgment for those claims directed at the individually named Defendants brought in their official capacity, as being\na way of pleading against the government entity itself. In terms of any claim brought against the individual Defendants in their\npersonal capacities, they argued summary judgment was appropriate based upon qualified immunity. In response to Defendants'\nmotion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs did not agree that the individual Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, but\ndid consent to the dismissal of the individual Defendants from the class action. Doc. No. 116 at p. 2.\n*3 On December 2, 2009, this Court granted Plaintiffs' partial motion for summary judgment of liability as to the County, and\ngranted Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the individual Defendants. Doc. No. 125. Following that order, the\nparties engaged in settlement negotiations, which ultimately resulted in a settlement agreement.\nB. Settlement Agreement\nAs noted above, the Settlement Agreement defines the Settlement Class as follows:\nAll persons who have been incarcerated at the Allegheny County Jail commencing on July 13, 2004 and continuing to March\n18, 2008 who, after being charged but not convicted of misdemeanors, summary offenses, civil commitments and traffic\ninfractions as defined by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as well as parole or probation violations where\nthe underlying offense is a misdemeanor, summary offense or traffic infraction who, pursuant to the policy of Allegheny\nCounty, have been strip searched upon their entry into the Allegheny County jail without reasonable suspicion.\nDoc. No. 151, Settlement Agreement at 8. The Settlement Agreement recognized that the County had changed its policy to\nstop strip-searching all pretrial detainees on a blanket basis and to stop strip-searching misdemeanor detainees in the absence\nof reasonable suspicion of a weapon or contraband. Id. at 11. The Settlement Agreement states that the ACJ's current written\npolicy has been reviewed by the Allegheny County Law Department for compliance with state and federal law. The County\nmaintains that the current policy is constitutional. The Settlement Agreement requires that all correction officers have access\nto the policy and are trained on search policy. The strip search policy will be posted in the intake area of the ACJ. Current and\nnew corrections officers have been and will continue to be trained regarding the strip search policy and when strip searches\nmay and may not be performed. See Settlement Agreement at 11.\nThe Settlement Agreement creates a fund in the amount of three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) to compensate class members.\nId. at 8. All administrative expenses, including the costs of settlement administration, website maintenance, notice to class\nmembers and attorneys' fees, costs, expenses, and incentive awards are to be deducted from the settlement fund prior to\ndetermining the amount of distributions to class members. Id. at 12. Class counsel agreed that they would seek not more than\nthirty three and one third percent (33 1/3%) of the gross Settlement Fund as attorneys' fees. Id. at 14. The Settlement Agreement\nalso states that an award of $18,000.00 will be requested for each of the two (2) class representatives. Id. at 20. The Settlement\nAgreement provides that each class member who submits a timely claim form will be granted a pro rata share of the Settlement\nFund in an amount not to exceed $3,000.00 per class member. Any undistributed funds will be donated to Neighborhood Legal\nServices Association of Allegheny County, PA.\n*4 Notice was to be provided by the direct mailing of class notice and a claim form to all identifiable individuals in\nthe Settlement Class. The Settlement Agreement provides that notice would also be given by television advertisement. The\nsettlement administrator was instructed to establish a website and maintain a toll-free number. Copies of the class notice and\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\nclaim form were to be available by request over the phone, and downloadable copies of the documents would be available at\nthe website. The Settlement Agreement provided the method for class members to submit requests for exclusion in writing.\nIt also provided the process for objecting to the settlement, including the reservation of the right to appeal final judgment of\nthe settlement. Id. at 18.\nThe Settlement Agreement was preliminarily approved by Order of Court on September 30, 2010.\nC. Notice to the Class\nThe claims administrator attests that notice went out to 12,398 putative class members on November 29, 2010, by direct first\nclass mail of the Class Notice and a claim form. See Doc. No. 158 at Exhibit A. All mail that was undeliverable because of\ninaccurate addresses was investigated by use of a locator database to ascertain the correct address and then re-mailed to the\nmembers of the class where possible. Id. 5,609 notices were returned as undeliverable, from which 3,254 notices were re-mailed\nafter updated addresses were obtained.\nThe claims administrator also contracted with a website administrator to create a website that provided information to the class in\nboth English and Spanish. The website administrator maintained the settlement website, www.alleghenystripsearch.com, which\nreceived 2,940 visitors, with the claim form having been viewed 1,862 times. A toll-free phone number was also established that\nhandled incoming telephone calls and written correspondence from prospective class members. Id. Finally, the administrator\nprovided notice through a limited notice campaign on television. See Doc. No. 151, Settlement Agreement.\nD. The Response of the Class\nThe claims administrator received 2,085 claims forms, none of which have yet to be validated. Of those, five members of the\nclass have opted out, and one objector, April Taylor, has submitted a written objection to the proposed settlement. Ms. Taylor\nobjects to the amount of the pro rata payout under the settlement. See Objection of April Taylor. She did not appear at the\nfairness hearing personally or by counsel.\nThe accumulated cost of the administrator for the services provided was $164,576.39. Of this amount, the administrator has\nbilled and received $93,395.22, and has not yet requested payment for the unbilled amount of $71,181.17. Due to the volume and\nresponse of the class, the administrator anticipates spending an additional $30,000.00 above the $235,000 originally projected\nas the class administration costs. Plaintiffs' have requested that the Court award a total of $265,000 in administrative costs, with\na credit/deduction for the $93,395.22 heretofore received by the administrator from class counsel.\nE. Attorney's Fees, Expenses, and Class Representative Awards\n*5 Class counsel have requested thirty three and one third percent (33 1/3%) of the gross Settlement Fund for attorney's fees,\nwhich amounts to a payment of $1,000,000.00. See Doc. No. 159. Class counsel also seeks reimbursement for out-of-pocket\ncosts and expenses of $155,030.91. Doc. No. 164. Finally, class counsel requests a special award of $18,000 for each of the\ntwo named class representatives. Doc. No. 159.\nDiscussion\nThe Court decides the following four questions:\n1. whether the proposed class can be properly certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23;\n2. whether notice to the class regarding the settlement and attorneys' fees petition was adequate;\n3. whether the settlement itself is fair, reasonable and adequate; and\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\n4. whether class counsels' petition for attorneys' fees, out-of-pocket expenses and special awards to the class representatives\nshould be approved.\nAs preliminary matter, the Court will discuss the law relating to the constitutionality of a strip-search policy such as that at issue\nhere. The Supreme Court has held that a court must analyze a prison's strip-search policy under the Fourth Amendment. See\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In Bell, a federal short-term custodial facility had a policy\nto strip-search all pretrial detainees after a contact visit with an outside visitor. The Court found that, under the circumstances,\nthe strip-searches conducted under the policy were not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. See id. at 559, 441 U.S.\n520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447.\nIn determining the reasonableness of a prison's search policy, the Bell Court held that courts must balance the prison's significant\nand legitimate interests in safety and security with the privacy interests of the individuals. See id. at 559–60, 441 U.S. 520,\n99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447. It presented four factors for a court to consider in that balance: (1) the scope of the particular\nintrusion; (2) the manner in which it is conducted; (3) the justification for initiating it; and (4) the place in which it is conducted.\nSee id . at 559, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447.\nThe Court in Bell found that the prison's policy was reasonable under this standard because the interest in preventing contraband\nfrom entering the prison facility outweighed the privacy interests of the inmates searched. The categorical reasonable suspicion\nthat a prisoner might use contact with an outside visitor to smuggle contraband into the prison justified the privacy intrusion\nunder the policy. See id. at 558, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447.\nThe holding in Bell was limited to the specific policy in question, and the Supreme Court left open the question of whether\nreasonable suspicion must be established to justify a policy to strip-search all incoming inmates or pretrial detainees. Since that\ntime, however, Circuit Courts of Appeal and several district courts have addressed the issue.\n2\nCourts in most circuits have held that a policy to strip-search all pre-trial detainees is unconstitutional under Bell.  These courts\nhave interpreted Bell to require that a prison have reasonable suspicion that a particular arrestee is concealing weapons or other\ncontraband before conducting a strip-search of that arrestee. Some of these courts have also concluded that Bell allows such\nreasonable suspicion to be established categorically for certain groups of prison detainees, such as those charged with felonies\n3\nor violent or drug-related misdemeanors.\n2 See Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir.2001); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1020,\n107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977, 110\nS.Ct. 503, 107 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir.1985); Stewart v. County of Lubbock, 767 F.2d 153\n(5th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1066, 106 S.Ct. 1378, 89 L.Ed.2d 604 (1986); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir.1984);\nMary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 455\nU.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982).\n3 See, e.g., Weber, 804 F.2d at 802; Masters, 872 F.2d at 1255; Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272.\n*6 Recently, the proverbial tide has turned with respect to suits challenging the constitutionality of such policies. The U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was the first to break with the majority when, sitting en banc, it overruled its previous\ndecisions on this issue. See Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2008) (en banc ) (overruling Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d\n1340 (11th Cir.2001)). The court in Powell held that a blanket strip-search policy for all arrestees can be constitutional under\nBell. It reasoned that the Bell balancing test allows for the interest of prison security to outweigh the individual privacy interests\nof detainees, regardless of whether there is reasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband.\nSee id. at 1309–12. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals followed suit when, also sitting en banc, it reversed prior precedent\nand upheld the San Francisco Sheriff's policy authorizing strip searches of all arrestees before they are placed in the general\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\npopulation of a county jail. Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir.2010) (en banc ) (overruling Giles\nv. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir.1984)).\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has very recently joined this trend. With the decision in Florence v. Board\nof Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296 (3d Cir.2010), the Court applied the balancing test of Bell\nand held that the challenged policy of conducting strip searches of all arrestees upon their admission into the general prison\npopulation was reasonable, and that the jails were not required to provide evidence of attempted smuggling or discovered\ncontraband as a justification for the policy. It is important to note that on September 15, 2010, six days before the Florence\ndecision, Plaintiffs moved for the preliminary approval of the settlement agreement reached between the parties. See Doc. No.\n153. Preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement was granted on September 30, 2010.\nWith that precedent in mind, the Plaintiffs in this case, therefore, would have to establish that the County's policy was\nunconstitutional under the Bell standard. They must show that, under the Bell balancing test, the policy was unreasonable as\napplied to all persons arrested for misdemeanors and minor crimes, in addition to those charged with violence, drug, or weapons-\nrelated crimes and those with a previous felony or violence, drug, or weapons-related misdemeanor convictions.\nA. Class certification\nA court presented with a request for approval of a class certification and settlement must separate its analysis of the class\ncertification from its determination that the settlement is fair. See In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation, 579 F.3d\n241, 257–58 (3d Cir.2009). To certify a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 23, a court must find that all four\nrequirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one part of Rule 23(b) are met. See Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 55 (3d Cir.1994).\n*7 Here, the Settlement Class includes all individuals who were placed into custody at ACJ after being charged with\nmisdemeanors or other minor crimes and were strip-searched upon entry into the general population of the institution. The class\nperiod commences on July 13, 2004 (which is two years prior to the date the original complaint was filed) and extends to, and\nincludes, March 18, 2008 (the date the Defendants stopped enforcing the former policy).\nOn November 30, 2007, Plaintiffs moved for class certification pursuant to Federal rules of Civil procedure 23(a) and 23(b)\n(3), or in the alternative 23(b)(2), seeking to certify a class consisting of all pretrial detainees who were placed into the custody\nof ACJ and strip searched after being charged with petty crimes under Defendants' former strip search policy. See Doc. Nos.\n65 & 66. On March 17 and 18, 2008, a hearing on Plaintiffs' motion for class certification was held before United States\nMagistrate Judge Robert C. Mitchell. On June 18, 2008, Magistrate Judge Mitchell recommended that Plaintiffs' motion for class\ncertification be granted. Doc. No. 94. More specifically, Magistrate Judge Mitchell agreed with plaintiffs that the class satisfied\nthe requirements under both Rule 23(b)(3) as a class entitled to monetary damages, and, in the alternative, as a class under Rule\n23(b)(2) entitled to injunctive relief. Defendants objected to the Report and Recommendation on July 7, 2008. Doc. No. 97. On\nAugust 8, 2008, this Court adopted the Report and Recommendation and granted the motion for class certification. Doc. No. 99.\nPlaintiffs now seek certification of the class for settlement purposes. In view of this Court's previous certification for the purpose\nof trial and the settlement agreement between the parties, the Court will consider final certification for settlement purposes.\n1. Analysis Under Rule 23(a)\nRule 23(a) requires that four requirements be met in order for a to be certified: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequate\nrepresentation. See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997). The Court\nfinds that the four requirements of Rule 23(a) are met.\na. Numerosity\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\nRule 23(a)(1) requires a class to be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Classes exceeding forty or more\nclass members are generally held to meet the numerosity requirement. See Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226–227 (3d\nCir.2001). The Settlement Class consists of potentially over 12,000 individuals. Currently, 2,085 of those individuals have\nsubmitted unverified claims forms. Because individual joinder of such a large class is impracticable, the Plaintiffs satisfy the\nnumerosity requirement. As Magistrate Judge Mitchell noted in his Report and Recommendation, Defendants have not disputed\nthat the numerosity requirement is satisfied. As such, the Court is satisfied that it has been met.\nb. Commonality\n*8 Rule 23(a)(2) requires that there are questions of law or fact common to the class. If class members share at least one\nquestion of law or fact in common, factual differences among the claims of the class members do not defeat certification. In re\nPrudential Ins. Co. America Sales Practice Litigation Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 310 (3d Cir.1998). In this case, there is a\nlegal issue common to all class members, which itself is based on a set of common facts and legal questions, such as: whether\nAllegheny County utilized a strip search policy or practice at ACJ during the proposed class period; whether the County's former\npolicy violated the plaintiffs' civil rights against unreasonable searches; and whether Allegheny County is directly responsible\nfor the alleged violations of plaintiffs' rights. This satisfies the Rule 23(a)(2) commonality requirement.\nc. Typicality and Adequacy\nRule 23(a) (3) and (a)(4) require that the claims or defenses of the representative parties be typical of the claims or defenses of the\nclass and that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit has noted that these two inquiries tend to merge because both evaluate the relation of the claims and the potential\nconflicts between the class representatives and the class in general. Beck v. Maximus, Inc., 457 F.3d 291, 296 (3d Cir.2006).\nThe typicality inquiry centers on whether the interests of the class representatives align with the interests of the absent class\nmembers such that the former is working towards the benefit of the class as a whole. See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 311.\nTwo distinct inquiries comprise the adequacy requirement. See id. at 312. The first inquiry determines whether any significant\nantagonistic interests or conflicts exist between the class representatives and absent class members. The second inquiry looks to\nthe experience and expertise of class counsel in representing the class. Id. If a court finds that a single class representative cannot\nrepresent the entire class, it may under Rule 23(c)(5) divide a class into subclasses where appropriate. When class members\nhave different claims or defenses or have conflicting or antagonistic interests, subclasses are appropriate. Each subclass is then\nto be treated as a class within the rule, and each must have its own representative. See id. at 312; Amchem, 521 U.S. at 627,\n117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689.\nIn this case, the typicality requirement and the first inquiry regarding the adequacy requirement are easily satisfied, as all\nclaims within the class are based upon the same blanket strip-search policy and practice. Similarly, the second inquiry regarding\nadequacy, that of the adequacy of representation, is also satisfied, as the class is represented by counsel who not only have\nexperience in complex civil rights litigation, but also a successful history with class action litigation involving this very issue.\n*9 For these reasons, the Court finds that the four requirements of Rule 23(a), numerosity, commonality, typicality, and\nadequacy are met in this case.\n2. Analysis under Rule 23(b)\nOnce a court determines that the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met, it must consider whether the action is maintainable under\none of the three parts of Rule 23(b). Plaintiffs continue to maintain that the class be certified under Rule 23(b)(3).\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\nRule 23(b)(3) allows certification only if the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any\nquestions affecting only individual members and if a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently\nadjudicating the controversy. This is commonly broken out into the so-called “predominance” and “superiority” requirements.\nSee In re: Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litigation, 579 F.3d at 258–59.\nRule 23(b)(3) also provides a non-exhaustive list of factors to aid the court in determining whether a class action is the best\nmethod of adjudication: (1) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate\nactions; (2) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (3) the\ndesirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (4) the likely difficulties\nin managing a class action. Although the fourth factor has been held to be not relevant in a settlement-only class certification,\nthe other requirements of the rule “demand undiluted, even heightened, attention in the settlement context.” Amchem, 521 U.S.\nat 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689.\na. Predominance\nUnder Rule 23(b)(3), a court must determine that common questions of law or fact predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members. Predominance is found when common questions represent a significant part of the case and can be\nresolved for all members of the class in a single adjudication. See 7AA Charles A. Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure\n§ 1778 (3d ed.2005). It “trains on the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member's case as a genuine controversy.”\nAmchem Products, 521 U.S. at 623. To establish predominance, Plaintiffs must show by a preponderance of the evidence that\nthe elements of their claim can be proven by evidence common to all in their class. See In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust\nLitig., 552 F.3d 305, 311–12 (3d Cir.2008).\nThe common factual and legal issues applicable to each class member recited above predominate over individual claims.\nEvidence of the circumstances of each individual search would not be necessary to prove this claim. The Court finds that the\ncommon questions of the constitutionality of the County's blanket strip-search policy as applied to members of the settlement\nclass meets the predominance requirement. Cf. Boone v. City of Philadelphia, 668 F.Supp.2d 693 (E.D.Pa.2009); Sutton v.\nHopkins County, Ky., 2007 WL 119892, *6–*9 (W.D.Ky.2007); Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 5–7 (1st Cir.2004);\nBlihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis, 219 F.R.D. 607, 620–22 (W.D.Wis.2003); Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69,\n76–77 (S.D.N.Y.2002). The predominance requirement under Rule 23(b)(3) is therefore satisfied.\nb. Superiority\n*10 Under the superiority requirement, a court asks whether a class action, rather than individual litigation, is the best method\nfor achieving a fair and efficient adjudication. See Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154 (3d\nCir.2001). A class action in this case saves the time, effort and expense of litigating the claims of as many as 12,000 class\nmembers individually and guarantees uniform treatment of individual class members. Just as this Court previously found that a\nclass action is the superior method of adjudicating this case given the nature of the suit, the approval of the settlement is superior\nto the individual adjudication of claims for compensatory relief. To that end, the Court notes that settlement will afford class\nmembers with the ability to obtain prompt, predictable and certain compensatory relief.\nIn sum, finding that the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(3) are met, the Court hereby certifies the class for settlement\npurposes.\nB. Notice regarding the settlement and attorneys' fees petition\nUnder Rule 23(c)(2)(B), notice must be given to potential class members by the best notice practicable under the circumstances\nfor all classes certified under Rule 23(b)(3). This includes individual notice to all potential class members that can be identified\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\nthrough reasonable effort. Notice must utilize clear, concise and plain language, and further state: (i) the nature of the action; (ii)\nthe definition of the class certified; (iii) the class claims, issues or defenses; (iv) the class member's right to enter an appearance\nby an attorney; (v) the class member's right to be excluded from the class; (vi) the time and manner for requesting exclusion;\nand (vii) the binding effect of settlement on class members. See Rule 23(c)(2)(B). A court must determine that notice was\nappropriate before evaluating the merits of the settlement itself. See, e.g., In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 326–27. In this case, the\nnotice given met the requirements of Rule 25(c)(2)(B). The notice, in all of the forms in which it was disseminated, described\nthe proposed settlement, its terms, and the nature of the claim filed on behalf of the class. It also described the class members'\nright to object or to be excluded from the settlement, including their opportunity to be heard at the fairness hearing, and the\nbinding effect of the settlement on those who choose not to opt out. Individual notice forms were mailed to 12,398 identified\nclass members. Those notifications that were returned as undeliverable were re-sent if another address could be found using the\nlocator database. Notice was also provided by way of a wesite and limited televison advertisements. Because individual notices\nwere sent to all identified class members and because the notice was widely disseminated over the internet and through televison\nbroadcasts, the Court finds that the efforts to provide notice under the requirements of Rule 23(c)(2)(B) have been met.\nC. Approval of the Settlement as Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate\n*11 In order to approve a class settlement, a court must find that the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate and in the best\ninterests of the class under Rule 23(e). In re General Motors Corp. Pick–Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability Litigation,\n55 F.3d 768, 785 (3d Cir.1995). When considering a class settlement, the “court plays the important role of protector of the\n[absent class members'] interests, in a sort of fiduciary capacity.” Id.\nIn Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153 (3d Cir.1975), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit set forth the following nine specific\nfactors that a district court should consider in determining whether a settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate: (1) the\ncomplexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the\nproceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages;\n(6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment;\n(8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; (9) the range of reasonableness of\nthe settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation. Id. at 157.\nApplying these factors, the Court is satisfied that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to the class members.\n1. Risks of Establishing Liability and Damages\nThe risks of establishing liability and the risk of establishing damages (the fourth and fifth factors) will be addressed first because\nthese two factors require close attention in view of the Florence decision. Given that decision, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs\nthat they face risks in establishing liability. Such risks support approval of the settlement. See Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 321.\nEven if Plaintiffs were able to establish liability, the amount of damages owed would present a challenge to Plaintiffs.\nCalculating the value of the plaintiffs' claims will depend upon a number of variables, including the circumstances and severity\nof the search and the effect of the search on the class members. As such, the consideration of damages also weighs towards\nsettlement.\n2. Complexity, Expense, and Likely Duration of the Litigation\nThe first Girsh factor, the complexity, expense, and duration of the litigation, weighs towards settlement in this case. At trial,\nPlaintiffs would face the task of proving the unconstitutionality of the Defendant's policy, which would be complex, expensive\nand in light of Florence, risky. These facts make settlement the best option under the first Girsh factor.\n3. Reaction of the Class to the Settlement\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\nThe second factor, reaction of the class, also favors approval of the settlement. Out of over 12,000 potential class members,\nonly one has formally objected. A low number of objectors compared to the number of potential class members creates a strong\npresumption in favor of approving the settlement. See In re Cendant Corp. Litigation, 264 F.3d 201, 234–35 (3d Cir.2001).\nMoreover, only five class members chose to opt out of the class. The fact that so few potential class members objected to or\nopted out of the settlement supports a finding of general acceptance of the settlement in the class.\n4. Stage of the Proceedings and the Amount of Discovery Completed\n*12 The third factor, the stage of the proceeding and the amount of discovery, similarly weighs towards acceptance of the\nsettlement. Post-discovery settlements such as this are more likely to reflect the true value of the claim. Bell Atlantic Corp.\nv. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304 (3d Cir.1993). Discovery has been extensive here, with numerous depositions taken and hundreds\nof documents reviewed by the parties. The discovery and other investigations that the parties have undertaken render them\nsufficiently informed to make a determination about the fairness of a settlement.\n5. Risks of Maintaining the Class Action through Trial and the Ability of the Defendants to withstand greater judgment\nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that given the Florence decision, the risks of maintaining a class through trial support approval\nof the settlement. See Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 321. There is always a risk of decertification in any class action. “Consistent\nwith this reality, we are satisfied that the inherent difficulties of bringing a class action to trial weighs in favor of approving the\nsettlements.” In re Automotive Refining Paint Antitrust Litigation, 617 F.Supp.2d at 344.\nIn terms of the County's ability to withstand a greater judgment, the Court notes that while it did not take any part in the\nnegotiations for settlement, it was apprised that one of the significant factors was the County's current financial situation. See\nDoc. No. 160 (describing the negotiations between the parties taking into account the financial condition of the County); see\nalso, settlement agreement at § III.B.3. detailing the installment arrangement for the County's funding of the settlement fund).\nTaking these representations into account as representative of the County's current financial situation, the Court finds that\nPlaintiffs do have a degree of cause for concern about the ability of Defendant to allocate its resources to a greater judgment,\nwhich weighs in favor of settlement.\n6. Reasonableness of the Settlement in light of the best possible recovery and the attendant risks of litigation\nFinally, the eighth and ninth factors, the reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best possible recovery and the\nattendant risks of litigation, support approval of the settlement. The reasonableness of a proposed settlement depends in part\nupon a comparison of the present value of the damages the plaintiffs would recover if successful, discounted by the risks\nof not prevailing. In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 806. Counsel for Plaintiffs project that each class member will receive\napproximately $662.77. Should the class proceed through litigation on the heels of the Florence decision, there is a relatively\nobvious risk of recovery at trial. Taken together, these factors weigh in favor of settlement.\nAfter applying the Girsh factors, the Court concludes that the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate under Rule 23(e) as al\nfactors weigh in favor of settlement. For the hereinabove stated reasons, the Court approves the settlement under Rule 23(e).\nD. Attorneys' Fees Petition\n*13 Class counsel in a class action who recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is\nentitled to a fair and reasonable award of attorneys' fees from the fund as a whole. Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U.S. 472,\n478, 100 S.Ct. 745, 62 L.Ed.2d 676 (1980). Class counsel calculate their fee award using the percentage-of-recovery method,\nwhich is the favored method in common fund cases. See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 333. They also use the alternative method\nof fee calculation, the lodestar method, as a cross-check in order to ensure that the fee amount is reasonable. See, e.g., In re\nInsurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation, 579 F.3d at 280–81.\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\nAs a result of these calculations, class counsel seek an award of attorneys' fees of thirty three and one third percent (33 1/3%)\nof the gross settlement fund, which would amount to an award of $1,000,000 in attorneys' fees. Doc. No. 159. Class Counsel\nalso seek reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and expenses in an amount of $155,030.91, and an incentive award to each of\nthe class representatives of $18,000 apiece.\nThe Court finds that all of these requests are reasonable with one caveat. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant Class\nCounsels' motion for attorneys' fees based upon a percentage of the total amount of the settlement fund, and will award fees\nin an amount of thirty percent (30%) of the fund.\n1. Reasonableness of the fees\nWhen the percentage-of-recovery method is utilized to determine attorneys' fees in a common fund case, the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit requires a district court to consider seven factors in determining the reasonableness of the fee.\nGunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp., 223 F.3d 190 (3d Cir.2000). These factors are: (1) the size of the fund created and the\nnumber of persons benefitted; (2) the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement\nterms and/or fees requested by counsel; (3) the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved; (4) the complexity and duration of\nthe litigation; (5) the risk of nonpayment; (6) the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs' counsel; and (7) the awards\nin similar cases. Gunter, 223 F.3d at 195 n. 1.\nThe first Gunter factor, the size of the fund created and number of persons benefitted, favors the fee requested, as class counsel\nwere able to obtain a reasonably sizable result, $3,000,000.00, for a potential class of 12,600 individuals. The second factor,\nthe number of substantial objections, also weighs in favor of class counsel. Only one objection has been formally filed to the\nsettlement generally and only five potential class members have opted out. The skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved\nalso supports approval of the attorneys' fee request. Class counsel are highly skilled in this area of the law and have conducted\nnumerous other strip-search class actions. The submissions of record and presentations in this case were thorough and well-\nprepared. As such, the skill and efficiency of the legal representation in this action by class counsel support the reasonableness\nof a fee request.\n*14 The fourth and fifth factors, the complexity and duration of the litigation and the risk of nonpayment, also support approval\nof class counsels' fee request. As discussed above, this case involved a complicated issue of constitutional law that was litigated\nduring a time of increasing uncertainty on the issue at hand. The professional services of class counsel were performed on a\ncontingent basis, and the costs and expenses advanced by counsel have not yet been reimbursed. Further, there was a clear risk\nof nonpayment with this litigation given the precedent of the Florence decision. Accordingly, a fee award is reasonable for\nthe time, effort and risk involved.\nWhile the sixth factor, the amount of time devoted by counsel, supports the fee amount, it does so to a slightly lesser extent.\nClass counsel documents 2,744.75 hours of contingent attorney services on this litigation to justify the amount requested in\ntheir petition. While this process has required more than four years of chronological time, the Court notes that a review of the\nprocedural history within this span of time includes time dedicated by Plaintiffs to amend their complaint on two occasions, as\nwell as numerous requests for extensions of time for various filing due dates. The Court is also mindful of the fact that while\nPlaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment (Doc. No. 107) was granted in part and denied in part, Defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment (Doc. No. 111) was also granted in part and denied in part. See Doc. No. 125.\nFurther, the Court cannot consider each factor in a vacuum. Just as the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved (the third\nGunter factor) may lend support to a request for fees, in this case, that skill has a slight dampening effect on the amount of time\ndevoted by counsel to pursue the cause of action (the sixth factor). While being thorough may be a hallmark of professionalism,\nthe line between thoroughness and being too thorough for the purpose of a fee award is difficult to delineate. In such cases, the\ngreater the skill brought to the civil action by counsel, when coupled with the remarkably similar issues involved and positions\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\nadvanced in many other class actions by the same counsel, somewhat qualifies the amount of time devoted by counsel to each\nindividual action.\nIn considering the seventh Gunter factor, the awards in similar cases, the Court finds that a percentage of thirty percent (30 %),\nas opposed to the requested thirty three and one third percent (33 1/3%) is more consistent with, and is in fact identical to, the\npercentage awarded in a number of other strip-search class action settlements in this Circuit. See, Boone v. City of Philadelphia,\n668 F.Supp.2d 693, 714–15 (E.D.Pa.2009); Suggs v. Cumberland County, 1:06–cv–87 (D.N.J.); Boiselle v. Mercer County,\n3:06–cv–2065 (D.N.J.); Clark v. County of Salem, 07–cv–2259 (D.N.J.); see also, Hicks v. County of Camden, 1:05–cv–1854\n(D.N.J.) (approving a 27.5% fee percentage). The Court sees nothing in this case that is fundamentally different from these\nreferenced cases which would warrant a higher percentage fee than that previously awarded. In support of their request for a\nhigher percentage, counsel argues that “Unlike here, these cases settled well prior to Florence.” Doc. No. 159 at 11. While\nthat may be the case, nevertheless, the parties presented the essential elements of the settlement agreement to the Court prior\nto the decision in Florence. That decision does weigh in favor of approval of the settlement under Rule 23(e), but the fact that\nthe decision was rendered shortly after the parties agreed upon a settlement does not justify a higher percentage fee than the\nother strip search cases referenced.\n*15 Here, the lodestar cross-check is neutral in terms of support for a percentage higher than thirty percent in the determination\nof reasonable attorneys' fees. In a lodestar application, fee calculation is a function of multiplying the number of hours spent\non the litigation by an appropriate hourly rate. See In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 819 n. 37. The Supreme Court has held\nthat the “market rate in the relevant community” is the reasonable rate to use. Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895, 104 S.Ct.\n1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has adopted the community market rate\nrule in determining the lodestar. Student Pub. Interest Research Group v. AT & T Bell Lab. (“SPIRG”), 842 F.2d 1436, 1448\n(3d Cir.1988). This rule requires courts to “assess the experience and skill of the attorneys and compare their rates to those of\ncomparable lawyers in the private business sphere.” Id. at 1447.\nClass Counsel originally presented a lodestar calculation of fees based on hourly rates ranging from $430.00 to $550.00 per\nhour. See Doc. No. 158. These rates appeared to be normal billing rates for the regions of three of the instant law firms, namely\nPhiladelphia and Washington D.C. However, in counsels' initial petition for fees, there was no evidence of the market rate for\nthis community, namely Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Following the fairness hearing, class counsel filed a supplemental\naffirmation in support of the fee petition. To their credit, class counsel acknowledge the following:\nRecent case authority from this Judicial District reflects that hourly rates for civil rights attorneys range from $130 to $385\nper hour, depending upon the stature of the attorney.... Much of the work performed in this action was undertaken by\nsenior attorneys with many years of class action experience. Without resubmitting recalculated records for all counsel, Class\nCounsel, for purposes of this submission, propose using a blended hourly rate of $280.00 per hour. At this hourly rate, Class\nCounsel's lodestar would be $768,530.00.\nDoc. No. 164. The Court agrees with class counsel regarding the market rates for this region, and further accepts the proposed\nlodestar calculation with the blended hourly rate. A lodestar of $768,530.00 would result in the application of a multiplier of 1.3\nif the Court were to award the thirty three and one third percent (33 1/3%) requested by class counsel. Whereas the multiplier will\nbe 1.17 in an award of thirty percent (30%). Although an applied multiplier need not fall within any pre-defined range, the Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit has noted that multipliers ranging from one to four are reasonable and frequently awarded in\ncommon fund cases when the lodestar method is applied. See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 341. Because either of the referenced\nmultipliers are within the reasonably accepted range, the lodestar cross-check is neutral in terms of the reasonableness of a\nthirty percent (30%) award of counsel fees, as opposed to a thirty three and one third percent (33 1/3%) award.\n2. Reimbursement of Out–of–Pocket Expenses\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\n*16 Additionally, class counsel seek reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and expenses advanced in this litigation in the\namount of $155,030.91. See Doc. No. 164. Class counsel has provided a breakdown for each firm or lawyer of said costs and\nexpenses by category, i.e, postage, mail and courier services; photocopying; telephone and facsimile; filing and litigation fees;\ntransportation, hotels, and meals; publications; research; and assessments for class fund administration. The expense totals for\neach category appear to be reasonable for a large, complex, multi-year litigation such as this case.\nFinally, class counsel has requested that the Court grant $265,000.00 to the administrator for class administration costs. This\nrequest is not unreasonable under the circumstances of this matter and will be granted subject to adjustment for the $93,395.22\nheretofore billed and received by the administrator.\nThe Court therefore approves class counsels' request for reimbursement of costs and expenses in the amount of $155,030.91\nand an award of $265.000.00 to the claims administrator minus the amount above referenced as advanced to the administrator\nby Class Counsel.\n3. Award to the Class Representatives\nClass counsel also requests a special incentive award of $18,000 for each named class representative. These awards, although\nhigh, are justified in view of the benefit to be realized by class members. The class representatives have accepted the public\nexposure of the fact that they have been placed into custody, charged with a crime, and strip searched. They do so for the benefit\nof the class, and the Court finds that these awards are reasonable compensation for the sacrifice of their anonymity.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons hereinabove set forth, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motion for Final Approval of Settlement and for an Award\nof Attorneys' Fees and Expenses to Class Counsel. Payments of class administration costs and incentive awards to each class\nrepresentative are also approved. The Court hereby certifies the class for settlement purposes and approves the settlement in\nthis class action as described in that motion.\nLastly, the Court acknowledges the STIPULATION AND ORDER REGARDING CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS OF\nVERIFIED CLASS MEMBERS filed of record in this action on May 23, 2011, Doc. No. 168, which will be incorporated into\nthis Court's final order.\nAn appropriate order granting final approval of class action settlement and judgment follows.\nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AND JUDGMENT\nTHIS CASE coming on for hearing before the Honorable Terrence F. McVerry, U.S.D.J. on March 1, 2011, pursuant to this\nCourt's Order of September 30, 2010, in order for this Court to conduct a Final Fairness Hearing to determine whether the\nproposed Settlement Agreement between the Parties is fair, reasonable and adequate, and to address Class Counsel's application\nfor an award of attorney's fees and costs; and the Settlement Class Members being represented by Class Counsel and Defendant\nbeing represented by its attorney; AND THE COURT having read and considered the Settlement Agreement, the Notice Plan,\nand Memorandum of Law submitted by Class Counsel, having received evidence at the hearing, having heard arguments from\nClass Counsel and the Defendant, and having considered the submissions by Class Members, now makes the following:\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n*17 1. This action was commenced on July 13, 2006, as a Class Action.\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\n2. After several years of intensive litigation, including extensive discovery and motion practice, and as a result of\nintensive, arm's length negotiations between Class Counsel and Defendant, including settlement conferences before former\nMagistrate Judge Kenneth J. Benson, the Parties have reached accord with respect to a Settlement that provides substantial\nbenefits to Settlement Class Members, in return for a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in this case against the\nDefendant (“Settlement Agreement”). The resulting Settlement Agreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on\nSeptember 30, 2010.\n3. As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a proposed Notice Plan and Class Notice,\nwhich provided Settlement Class Members notice of the proposed Settlement. The Notice Plan provided an opportunity\nfor Class Members to file objections to the Settlement, and an opportunity to opt out of the Settlement.\n4. As of the deadline for the filing of objections, one objection was filed by April D. Taylor, who objected to the pro rata\namount of the settlement for each claim. While this Court sympathizes with the experience of Ms. Taylor, her objection\nis overruled. Without this settlement, Ms. Taylor, like all other members of the class, face a legitimate risk of recovering\nnothing for their experience. Given the size of this Settlement, and the Notice Plan described above, this Court finds that\nthe absence of any other objection is indicative of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement with the\nDefendant.\n5. The settling Parties have filed with the Court an affidavit declaring that the mailing of the Court approved notice,\nconsistent with the Notice Plan, has been completed.\n6. The Court finds that the published notice, mailed notice and Internet posting constitute the best practicable notice of the\nFairness Hearing, proposed Settlement, Class Counsel's application for fees and expenses, and other matters set forth in\nthe Class Notice and Short Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all members\nof the Settlement Class, and complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the\nConstitution of the United States, the laws of Pennsylvania and any other applicable law.\n7. Any persons who wished to be excluded from this action were provided an opportunity to “opt out” pursuant to the\nNotice. All persons who have validly excluded themselves from the action have no rights under the Settlement Agreement\nand shall not be bound by the Settlement Agreement or the final judgment herein and the names of those persons are set\nforth in Attachment A.\n8. Settlement Class Members are bound by the: Settlement, Settlement Agreement, Release contained within the Settlement\nAgreement, Stipulation and Order Regarding Child Support Obligations of Verified Class Members, and the Final Order\nand Judgment. Settlement Class Members do not have a further opportunity to opt out of this Action.\n*18 9. Any Class Member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to the Settlement Agreement, to the\nentry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Class Counsel's application for fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the\nprocedure set forth in the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed\nto have waived any such objection by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise.\n10. On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the Settlement Agreement, the Court is of the\nopinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable and adequate compromise of the claims against the Defendant in this case,\npursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. There are a number of factors which the Court has considered\nin affirming this Settlement, including:\na. The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested;\n © 2011 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14\n\nFor Educational Use Only\nDelandro v. County of Allegheny, Slip Copy (2011)\nb. This Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class Members now, without further litigation, under circumstances\nwhere the liability issues are still vigorously contested among the Parties to this litigation. This Settlement provides Class\nMembers with a substantial monetary benefit; and,\nc. This Settlement is clearly a product of hard fought litigation between the Parties, and not a result of any collusion on the\npart of Class Counsel or Counsel for the Defendant.\n11. Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendant their application for reasonable attorneys' fees, costs,\nand expenses consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. This Court has considered Class Counsel's request\nand hereby grants the request for costs and expenses, and further grants the request for attorney's fees as modified by the\nCourt in the amount of thirty percent (30%) of the gross settlement fund ($900,000.00).\n12. The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair, a simplified process, and workable. In any\nevent, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work out any unanticipated problems.\nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT, THE COURT HEREBY\nMAKES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:\n13. This Court has jurisdiction over the Parties and the subject matter of this proceeding.\n14. Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following Settlement Class is certified for purposes\nof final settlement:\nSettlement Class:\nAll persons who have been incarcerated at the Allegheny County Jail commencing on July 13, 2004 and continuing to March\n18, 2008 who, after being charged but not convicted of misdemeanors, summary offenses, civil commitments and traffic\ninfractions as defined by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as well as parole or probation violations where\nthe underlying offense is a misdemeanor, summary offense or traffic infraction who, pursuant to the policy of Allegheny\nCounty, have been strip searched upon their entry into the Allegheny County jail without reasonable suspicion.\n*19 15. The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure are satisfied, and that a Class Action is an appropriate method for resolving the disputes in this litigation. All\nthe prerequisites for class certification under Rule 23 are present. The Class Members are ascertainable and too numerous\nto be joined. Questions of law and fact common to all Class Members predominate over individual issues and should be\ndetermined in one proceeding with respect to all Class Members. The Class Representatives' claims are typical of those of\nthe Class. The Class Action mechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating and resolving this action.\n16. The class administration costs in the amount of $265,000.00, subject to adjustment for amounts heretofore paid, are\napproved for payment to the class administrator.\n17. The Settlement Class Representatives, Harry Delandro and Karen Murphy, are entitled to and are hereby awarded a\npayment of eighteen thousand dollars ($18,000.00) apiece, in recognition of the efforts they undertook in connection with\nthis litigation.\n18. All Class Members who have made claims on the settlement are entitled to receive their pro rata share of the Settlement\nfund, however not to exceed $3,000.00 per class member, after administrative expenses, attorneys' fees, costs, and\nexpenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the fund.

Relative to pre-trial detainees charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes, \nincluding all of the class members in this certified class action, these blanket searches are clearly \nunconstitutional.    One  Circuit  Court  has  described  the  County’s  practices  here  as  being \n“demeaning,  dehumanizing,  undignified,  humiliating,  terrifying,  unpleasant,  embarrassing, \nrepulsive, signifying degradation and submission.”  Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d \n1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).   \n  The Court, in denying the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, has already followed the \nunanimous case precedent from this and most other judicial districts in finding that blanket strip \nsearches are unconstitutional.  As there are no material facts in dispute, the Plaintiffs respectfully \nsuggest that summary judgment on liability is appropriate, and that the Court should hold that the \nCounty’s uniform strip search policies, as applied to members of the Certified Class, are illegal.  \nSee, Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 426 F. Supp.2d 1 (N.D.N.Y. 2006). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(cid:1)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 4 of 17\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  The facts supporting this motion are summarized, with citations to the motion record, in \nthe Plaintiffs’ Statement of Material Facts, and will only be briefly stated here.   \nA.  The County’s Admissions Regarding An Illegal, Blanket Strip Search Policy and \nPractice \nThe  Allegheny  County  Jail  is  a  local  correctional  facility  that  services  the  City  of \nPittsburgh and its neighboring communities in Allegheny County.  The facility houses, in large \npart, pre-trial detainees who are unable to make bail.  The facility houses, on average, 2,500 \ndetainees on any given day.  (Allegheny County Dep., pp. 120) (Keach Aff., Ex. D).  Class \nCounsel estimates that the class size here is 13,000 individuals.  (Keach Aff., ¶ 4).  Many of \nthese  detainees,  including  Plaintiff  Harry  Delandro,  are  individuals  subjected  to  “bench \nwarrants” for failure to appear in Court, and are housed for several days before even seeing a \njudge.  (Allegheny County Dep., p. 36-37).  Approximately 60 percent of these individuals are \nreleased immediately after their initial arraignment.  (Allegheny County Dep., p. 37).  \n   The County, in response to a deposition notice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. Rule \n30(b)(6),  proffered  Corrections  Lieutenant  Phil  Cestra  as  its  designated  deponent.    (See, \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition, dated May 8, 2007) (Keach Aff., Ex. C).  Lieutenant Cestra is \nthe officer primarily in charge of the “Intake/Booking Area” of the Allegheny County Jail.  \n(Allegheny County Dep., p. 14).  Lieutenant Cestra admitted that all detainees are subjected to a \nblanket strip search when receiving the jail uniform in “Phase 6” of the booking process at the \nAllegheny County Jail, according to the express requirements of Allegheny County’s written \npolicies.  (Allegheny  County  Dep.,  pp.  20-22,  111,  155-56,  165-67;  Allegheny  County \nAdministrative Directive Number 16, “Methods of Searching Inmates,” p. 3 (Keach Aff., Ex. \n(cid:1)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 5 of 17\nE)). The primary justification for these blanket strip searches is that detainees “have been \nintermingled” with others.  (Allegheny County Dep., p. 165-67).  These searches largely include \na visual examination of the genitals, as well as requesting detainees to bend at the waist and/or \nmanipulate the buttocks, breasts and genitals to allow for a visual inspection of their body \ncavities and skin folds.  (Allegheny County Dep., p. 22).  Female detainees are required to “squat \nand cough” to see if any contraband is dislodged from the vagina.  (Allegheny County Dep., p. \n22).  These searches are done on all detainees, regardless of criminal charge or individualized \nreasonable suspicion, for the express purpose of finding contraband.  (Allegheny County Dep., p. \n22-23, 166-67).  Lieutenant Cestra admitted, however, that the bulk of the Allegheny County \nJail’s contraband problem stems from detainees already sentenced, not “new arrestees,” because \n“[m]ost people don’t walk around with [items secreted in their rectum or vagina].”  (Allegheny \nCounty Dep., pp. 150, 152-53).  Subsequent to the filing of this action, Allegheny County \namended their written strip search policy, Policy Number 21 – Method of Searching Inmates – to \nexpressly reflect its practice of strip searching all pretrial detainees who receive the Jail Uniform.  \nThe new written policy, dated August 9, 2006, was amended as follows:  \n Pre-trial detainees that can not make bond or bail, after arraignment, and their \nlegal paperwork has been processed may be strip searched after being “three \npaged” by the medical department and before they are deloused, showered and \nsent to the general population intake pad as they are court ordered detainees at this \ntime. \n \n(Policy Number 21, dated August 9, 2006, p. 3) (Keach Aff., Ex. F).   \n  The testimony of other Corrections Officers from the Allegheny County Jail confirms \nthat all detainees are being subjected to a uniform strip search when they receive the jail uniform.  \nDuring the course of discovery, the Plaintiffs deposed the following Corrections Officers, who \n(cid:1)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 6 of 17\nadmitted to conducting blanket strip searches on all pretrial detainees who receive the Jail \nUniform: \n  Corrections Officer    Deposition Pages    Exhibit Letter___________            \n  John W. Colbert    17-19        Exhibit I \n       \n(cid:1)  “The search officer takes them into the shower area and closes the curtains \nbehind them.  There they have to take their clothes off in front of the \nofficer; and the officer asks them to put their arms out, lift their groin, turn \naround, bend over, spread and cough.  That’s procedure that we were \ntaught…That happens to everybody.” \n \nJoan MacLennan    26        Exhibit J \n \n(cid:1)  “Q:  As far as you know, does the criminal history and background of the \nperson play any significance in the booking procedure? \nA:  No.” \n   \n  Lewis Wilson, Jr.    22        Exhibit  K \n \n(cid:1)  “Q:  Okay.  And that happens without regard to the offense for which they \nwere arrested? \nA:  Yes, as I said, if they’re going upstairs, you’ll get a strip search. \nQ:  You don’t review an inmate’s institutional history before you strip \nsearch? \nA:  That’s none of my business. \nQ:  And you don’t review their criminal history at all? \nA:  That’s none of my business.” \n \n  Sandra Rugani     29, 31       Exhibit L \n \n(cid:1)  “Bend, spread and cough, basically, and I have them do that twice because \nfemales have been known to have things hidden of contraband, weapons \nthat  we  have  found  in  this  area.”    Strip  searches  done  in  “all \ncircumstances.” \n \nDavid Younkins    21, 23       Exhibit M \n \n(cid:1)  “Q:  Do you know the offense a person has been charged with at the time \nthey’re in the shower area and you’re searching them? \nA:  I’m sure if I paid attention, I probably could, but I usually don’t pay \nattention to that. … \nQ: Has there ever been a time that a detainee has come into the facility and \ncome into the shower area that you have not strip searched them? \n(cid:1)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 7 of 17\nA: No.” \n \nCorrections Officers Colbert and Younkins confirmed this blanket strip search regimen when \ntestifying during the Preliminary Injunction Hearing held before the Court on March 17, 2008.  \n(Transcript of Preliminary Injunction Hearing, Day One, pp. 24-25, 28-31, Exhibit G).   \nIn short, the Plaintiffs maintain that they have clearly established that Allegheny County \nstrip searches all pre-trial detainees upon their admission to the Allegheny County Jail, and that \nthis regimen is officially sanctioned by policy making officials who oversee the Jail.   \nB.  Facts Relevant to the Named Plaintiffs, Harry Delandro and Karen Murphy \nOn or about April 19, 2006, Harry Delandro, a resident of Pittsburgh, was arrested and \nplaced in Allegheny County Jail for failing to pay child support.  (Second Amended Complaint, \nat ¶ 3) (Keach Aff., Ex. A).  See, Simpson v. Saponara, 375 A.2d 146, 147 (Pa. Super. 1977) \n(failure to pay child support is viewed as a misdemeanor in Pennsylvania).  At the time of the \narrest, Mr. Delandro was on crutches and wearing a foot immobilizer.  (Delandro Deposition, p. \n22, Exhibit N).   Mr. Delandro was put in a holding cell for the night.  (Id., at p. 15-16).  The \nfollowing morning before having seen a judge, Delandro was provided jail issue clothes and strip \nsearched.  (Id., at p. 20-21).  The strip search required him to remove his underwear, spread the \nlobes of his buttocks and lift his testicles in connection with the search.  (Id., at p.21).  The next \nday, Mr. Delandro went to court where he was ordered to be released.    However, after returning \nto jail, he was put in another holding cell, strip searched yet again and finally released that \nevening.  (Transcript of Preliminary Injunction Hearing, Day One, p. 7, Exhibit G).  \nOn or about August 22, 2005, Karen Murphy was arrested and placed in Allegheny \nCounty Jail for misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and harassment.  Disorderly conduct \nand harassment is a misdemeanor offense under the Pennsylvania Crimes Code.  See 18 Pa. \n(cid:1)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 8 of 17\nC.S.A. § 5503(b).  On August 25, 2005, Ms. Murphy was arrested after placing a call to 911 \noperators requesting that the police be sent to her elderly father’s home to check on him.  \n(Transcript of Preliminary Injunction Hearing, Day One, pp. 12-13, Exhibit G).  As a result of \nthe 911 call, Ms. Murphy was charged with harassment.  At the time of the arrest, plaintiff \nMurphy was wearing only her underwear and a t-shirt.  (Id., at p.13).  At initial booking, Ms. \nMurphy was put in a holding cell where she remained for several hours.  She was thereafter strip \nsearched during the course of a supervised shower.  She was required to completely disrobe, lift \nher breasts, squat and manipulate her genital areas so that she could be visually inspected by a \nfemale guard.  (Id., at p.14-15).   During her testimony before the Court, Ms. Murphy further \ndetailed that the Corrections Officer who conducted her search called Murphy a “b*tch,” and that \nshe was “totally humiliated. Embarrassed.  I feel like I was raped.”  (Id., at 15-16).   \n  C. Procedural History \n  At the outset of this proceeding, the County moved to dismiss this action, and claimed \nthat their strip search regimen was constitutional.  (See, Docket Entry Number 8).  The Court \nrejected these arguments, and, in doing so, adopted the authority from other circuit courts, and \nother District Courts in this Judicial Circuit, that blanket strip searches of pre-trial detainees \ncharged  with  misdemeanors  and  other  minor  crimes  are  unconstitutional.    (Report  and \nRecommendation Denying Motion to Dismiss, pp. 4-5, Exhibit  B).  Later, the Court granted the \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction and their Motion for Class Certification.   \n \n \n \n \n(cid:2)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 9 of 17\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT LEGAL STANDARD \n  Summary judgment should be granted “if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if, \nviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the moving party is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” See Pearson v. Component Tech. Corp., 247 F.3d 471, \n482 n.1 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. \nEd. 2d 265 (1986)); accord Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  The Court should enter summary judgment \nonly  when  “the  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and  admissions  on  file, \ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \nthat the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  The \n“summary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as a disfavored procedural shortcut, but \nrather as an integral part of the Federal Rules as a whole, which are designed ‘to secure the just, \nspeedy and inexpensive determination of every action.’”  Holt Cargo Sys., Inc. v. Delaware \nRiver Port Auth., 20 F. Supp. 2d 803, 818 (E.D. Pa. 1998) (granting defendants’ motion for \nsummary judgment), aff’d, 165 F.3d 242 (3d Cir. 1999). \n  An issue is “genuine” if it is supported by such evidence that a reasonable jury could \nreturn a verdict in the nonmoving party's favor. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).  A fact is “material” if, under the governing \nsubstantive law, a dispute about the fact might affect the outcome of the suit.  Id.  In determining \nwhether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view the facts and all reasonable \ninferences drawn from those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See, \nFlorence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 595 F. Supp. 2d 492, 502 (D.N.J. 2009) \n(citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 \nL. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)). \n(cid:1)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 10 of 17\n  Initially, the moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue \nof material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 \n(1986).  Once the moving party has met this burden, the nonmoving party must identify, by \naffidavits or otherwise, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  Id.  Thus, to \nwithstand  a  properly  supported  motion  for  summary  judgment,  the  nonmoving  party  must \nidentify specific facts and affirmative evidence that contradict those offered by the moving party. \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 256-57. “A nonmoving party may not ‘rest upon mere allegations, general \ndenials or … vague statements …’” See Trap Rock Indus., Inc. v. Local 825, Int'l Union of \nOperating Eng'rs, 982 F.2d 884, 890 (3d Cir. 1992) (quoting Quiroga v. Hasbro, Inc., 934 F.2d \n497, 500 (3d Cir. 1991)). \n  In deciding the merits of a party's motion for summary judgment, the Court's role is not to \nevaluate the evidence and decide the truth of the matter, but to determine whether there is a \ngenuine issue for trial.  See Florence, 595 F. Supp. 2d at 502 (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)).  Credibility determinations \nare the province of the finder of fact.  See Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 974 F.2d \n1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992).  If there is no genuine issue of material fact upon review of cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, then judgment may be entered in favor of the deserving party in \nlight of the law and undisputed facts.  See Iberia Foods Corp. v. Romeo Jr., 150 F.3d 298, 302 \n(3d Cir. 1998) (citing Ciarlante v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 143 F.3d 139, 145-46 \n(3d Cir. 1998)). \n \n \n \n(cid:2)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 11 of 17\nARGUMENT \n  This Court has already denied a motion to dismiss filed by Defendants, holding that “the \nplaintiffs have stated a viable claim that the [D]efendants violated their Fourth Amendment \nrights to be free from unreasonable searches.”  Order dated December 7, 2006, Dkt. No. 15, at 7, \nadopted by the District Court by Order dated January 8, 2007, Dkt. No. 20.  The Court found that \n“the strip and visual body cavity searches must be justified by at least a reasonable suspicion that \nthe arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons.”  Dkt. No. 15, at 4.  Thus, it is law of the case \nthat a blanket strip search policy for misdemeanor pretrial detainees does not pass constitutional \nmuster.1  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs detail below the near-unanimous authority, some of which was \nrecently decided by District Courts within the Third Circuit, holding blanket jail strip searches of \nmisdemeanor detainees unconstitutional.        \n \n  A.  The Overwhelmingly Majority of Federal Courts Have Held that Blanket Jail  \n    Strip Search Policies are Unconstitutional When Applied to Individuals Charged  \n    With Misdemeanors or Other Minor Crimes. \n \n  The Fourth Amendment protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures by \nthe government.  In the context of searches incident to criminal detention, the United States \nSupreme Court held in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), that:  \n[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application.  In each case it requires a balancing of the \nneed for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.  Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the \nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \nwhich it is conducted. \n \nId. at 559.  An examination of one’s naked body, especially someone’s anus and vagina, clearly \nconstitutes “an invasion of personal rights of the first magnitude.”  Chapman v. Nichols, 989 \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n1 “Under the law of the case doctrine, once an issue is decided, it will not be relitigated in the same case, except in \nunusual circumstances.”  See Hayman Cash Register Co. v. Sarokin, 669 F.2d 162, 165 (3d Cir. 1982).   \n(cid:1)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 12 of 17\nF.2d 393, 395 (10th Cir. 1993).  “[F]ew exercises of authority by the state… intrude on a citizen’s \nprivacy and dignity as severely as the visual anal and genital searches practiced here.”  Mary \nBeth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).   \n  The  overwhelming  majority  of  Circuit  Courts,  when  considering  the  balancing  test \nrequired by Bell, have held that strip searches cannot be utilized against individuals charged \nwith, but not convicted of, minor crimes (misdemeanors, summary offenses, arrests on bench \nwarrants, etc.) in the absence of reasonable suspicion to believe a detainee is in possession of a \nweapon or contraband.2  See Wood v. Hancock County Sheriff’s Dep’t., 354 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. \n2003); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 801 (2d Cir. 1986); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 \n(4th Cir. 1981); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1985); Masters v. \nCrouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989); Mary Beth G., 723 \nF.2d at 1273; Jones v.

This is \nbecause “[r]equiring particularized reasonable suspicion to strip search misdemeanant arrestees \nbalances  institutional  security  needs  with  individual  privacy,  which  includes  a  reasonable \nexpectation not to be unclothed involuntarily, to be observed unclothed or to have one’s private \nparts observed or touched by others.”  Wood, 354 F.3d at 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n2 Over twenty class actions have been successfully prosecuted regarding this practice, including several in major \nurban areas like Pittsburgh.

District Courts Within The Third Circuit Have Universally Held that Blanket Jail  \n    Strip Search Policies are Unconstitutional When Applied to Individuals Charged  \n    With Misdemeanors or Other Minor Crimes. \n \n  District Courts within the Third Circuit that have confronted the issue of blanket jail strip \nsearches of misdemeanor detainees have held them to be unconstitutional.  Recently, in Florence \nv. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 595 F. Supp. 2d 492 (D.N.J. 2009), the plaintiffs \nwho consisted, like here, of a certified class of pre-trial detainees who were strip searched \nwithout reasonable suspicion of concealment of contraband, drugs or weapons, sought summary \njudgment.  Id. at 495.  In granting summary judgment, the court found that “the overwhelming \nweight of authority still supports the conclusion that blanket strip searches of non-indictable \noffenders, performed without reasonable suspicion for drugs, weapons, or other contraband, is \nunconstitutional.”  Id. at 513.  Similarly, in Allison v. GEO Group, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n24522 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 24, 2009), the plaintiffs were arrestees who alleged that the defendant had \na policy or practice of strip searching all arrestees without any individualized suspicion that those \narrestees had secreted contraband.  In denying defendant’s motion for the judgment on the \npleading, the court agreed with the overwhelming authority “that suspicionless arrestee strip \nsearches,  either  pursuant  to  a  blanket  policy  or  conducted  individually,  violate  the  Fourth \nAmendment.”  Id. at * 57.  Other courts within the Third Circuit that have considered this issue \nhave uniformly held that suspicionless custodial strip searches of detained arrestees violate the  \nFourth Amendment.  See Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F. Supp. 772, 789-91 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (blanket \nstrip searches of misdemeanor defendants at the Schuylkill county Jail found unconstitutional); \nDuffy v. County of Bucks, 7 F.Supp. 2d 569, 579-580 (E.D. Pa. 1998) (“A strip search, regardless \nof how professionally and courteously conducted, is an embarrassing and humiliating experience \n.  .  .  officers  must  have  reasonable  individualized  suspicion  that  a  detainee  is  carrying  or \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 14 of 17\nconcealing contraband.”) (citations omitted); Davis v. City of Camden, 657 F. Supp. 396, 400-01 \n(D.N.J. 1987) (holding unconstitutional blanket strip searches in Camden County Jail); Martino \nv. County of Camden, 2005 WL 1793718 (D.N.J. July 26, 2005) (same); O’Brien v. Borough of \nWoodbury Heights, 679 F.Supp. 429, 433 (D.N.J. 1988) (holding unconstitutional blanket strip \nsearch policy at the Gloucester County Jail); Wilkes v. Borough of Clayton, 696 F.Supp. 144, 149 \n(D.N.J. 1988) (holding unconstitutional policy of watching all detainees use bathroom).  \n  Accordingly, this Court should follow the legion of authority within and outside this \nJudicial Circuit.3   \n  C.  The Court Should Grant Summary Judgment Because There is No Genuine Issue  \n    of Material Fact Concerning the Defendants’ Blanket Strip Search Policy and  \n    Practice at the Allegheny County Jail. \n \n  As  detailed  in  Plaintiffs’  Statement  of  Material  Facts,  Defendants’  witnesses  have \nadmitted that they maintained a policy and practice from July 13, 2004 until March 18, 2008 of \nconducting blanket strip and visual cavity searches of all pre-trial detainees admitted to the \ncustody of the Allegheny County Jail at the time that the detainees received the Jail Uniform.    \nThese searches involved a strip search, where naked detainees are visually observed by a \nCorrections Officer, and visual cavity searches, where detainees are required to manipulate their \nbuttocks and genitals to allow for an inspection of their scrotum, vagina and anus.  These \nsearches were performed on all individuals, regardless of the crime charged, disability, criminal \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n3 Plaintiffs are aware that the Eleventh Circuit in Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc) \nrecently broke with the other Circuits’ interpretation of Bell.  Plaintiffs believe that Powell was wrongly decided and \nis not persuasive authority, as the two District Courts within this Circuit that have thoroughly examined it have \nrecognized.  See Florence, 595 F. Supp. 2d at 511. (“[T]his Court ultimately finds [Powell’s] contrarian holding less \nthan compelling.  The post-contact visit searches upheld in Bell are dissimilar to the post-intake searches struck \ndown by the circuits in the thirty years since that decision. Thus, Powell does not present a convincing argument . . \n.”); see also Allison, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24522 at 64 (“this Court disagrees with both the reasoning and holding \nof the Eleventh Circuit in Powell”).  Moreover, as discussed above, because it is law of the case that a blanket strip \nsearch policy for misdemeanor pretrial detainees does not pass constitutional muster, this Court should not even \nconsider the non-binding Powell decision.    \n \n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 15 of 17\nhistory, institutional history, age or suspicion of possession of contraband.  In short, these \nsearches were performed in the absence of individualized reasonable suspicion.4  \n  As detailed above, case precedent overwhelmingly holds that strip searches cannot be \nutilized against individuals charged with, but not convicted of, minor crimes (misdemeanors, \nsummary offenses, arrests on bench warrants, etc.) in the absence of reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve a detainee is in possession of a weapon or contraband.  The undisputed facts establish \nthat Defendants had a policy and practice of strip-searching all arrestees without individualized \nsuspicion, in violation of clearly established Constitutional law.  Accordingly, because there is \nno genuine issue of material fact, the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be \ngranted.   \n \n \n \n \n \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n4 Defendants’ anticipated reliance upon “commingling” with the general prison population is unavailing as a \njustification for blanket strip searches.  See Allison, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24522 at 73-74 (citations omitted) (“the \nCourt is not influenced by the fact that some persons do anticipate their own arrests and might have the opportunity \nto conceal contraband. . . Such circumstances do not justify an otherwise unreasonable blanket policy.”); see also \nNewkirk, 834 F. Supp. at 789-90 (rejecting defendants' argument that the strip searches of non-violent protestors \npursuant to a blanket policy was reasonable because persons \"'who commit actions intending or expecting to go to \nprison'\" threaten institutional security); Roberts v. State of Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 112-113 (1st Cir. 2001) (“the \ndeterrent rationale for the Bell search is simply less relevant given the essentially unplanned nature of an arrest and \nsubsequent incarceration”); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1254 (6th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 \n(1989) (“the fact of intermingling alone has never been found to justify such a search without consideration of the \nnature of the offense and the question of whether there is any reasonable basis for concern that the particular \ndetainee will attempt to introduce weapons or other contraband to the institution”); John Does 1-100 v. Boyd, 613 F. \nSupp. 1514, 1524 (D. Minn. 1985) (“[T]he commingling of detainees does not mandate a finding that the \ndefendants’ strip search policy is constitutional … any danger associated with commingling is minimized by the fact \nthat a detainee’s arrest is an unplanned event.  The danger of smuggling is therefore wholly unsubstantiated.  \nFurther, methods can be devised by defendants to minimize commingling.”).      \n   \n     \n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 108    Filed 04/24/09   Page 16 of 17\nCONCLUSION \n  For these reasons, the Plaintiffs and the Certified Class respectfully request that this \nCourt grant their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Liability, and that it also provide any \nother relief it finds to be just, proper and equitable.  \n            Respectfully Submitted By: \n(cid:1)\n(cid:1) /s Elmer Robert Keach, III \n  \n            __________________     \nDated:  April 24, 2009    Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire \n  Member of the Bar, USDC, W.D.

If the Court approves it, and after any possible \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 35 of 62\nobjections and appeals are resolved, an administrator appointed by the Court will make \nthe monetary payments that the Settlement allows. You will be informed of the progress \nof the Settlement.  You should understand that the process of Court approval may take a \ngood deal of time.   \n \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the Settlement, your legal rights, what benefits \nare available, who is eligible for them and how to get them.   \n \nThe Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania, United States District Judge Terrence F. McVerry \npresiding.  The case is called Delandro, et al.  v. County of Allegheny, Case No. 06-CV-\n927.  The persons who sued are called the Plaintiffs, and the municipality they sued, the \nCounty of Allegheny, is called the Defendant. \n \nII.   WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT? \n \nPlaintiffs claim in this lawsuit that the County of Allegheny illegally strip \nsearched individuals upon their admission to the Allegheny County Jail who were \ncharged with minor offenses, in violation of the unreasonable search provisions of the \nUnited States Constitution. Defendant denies that it did anything wrong, and contends \nthat even if it did do anything wrong, Plaintiffs and the Class Members are not entitled to \nany money as a result of being searched.   \n \nIII.   WHY IS THIS A CLASS ACTION? \n \nIn a Class Action, one or more people, called the Class Representatives (in this \ncase, Karen Murphy and Harry Delandro), sue on behalf of all people who have similar \nclaims.  All of these people are a Class or Class Members.  A Class Action resolves the \nissues for all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the Class.  \nUnited States District Judge Terrance F. McVerry is in charge of this Class Action \nlawsuit. \n \nIV.      WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \n \nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendant.  Instead, both sides \nagreed to a Settlement.  That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people \naffected will get compensation.  The Class Representatives and their attorneys think the \nSettlement is best for everyone who is alleged to have been illegally strip searched.   \n \nV.   HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM PART OF THE SETTLEMENT? \n \nEveryone who fits the following description is a Settlement Class Member: you \nwere placed in the custody of the Allegheny County Jail between July 13, 2004 and \ncontinuing  to  March  18,  2008,  after  being  charged  with  misdemeanors;  summary \noffenses; traffic infractions; civil commitments or other minor crimes; or bench warrants, \nparole  violations  or  probation  violations  where  the  underlying  charge  was  a \nmisdemeanor, summary offense or other minor crime. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 36 of 62\n \n \nThe Settlement does not cover individuals who entered the Allegheny County Jail \nafter being convicted of (as compared to only being charged with) a crime, individuals \ncharged with felonies upon their entry into the Allegheny County Jail, or anyone who \nentered the Allegheny County Jail but was not strip searched as part of the Allegheny \nCounty Jail’s booking procedure.  Based on discovery in this action, it is clear that many \nindividuals who entered the Allegheny County Jail were not strip searched because they \nwere  bailed  out  or  otherwise  released  before  receiving  the  Allegheny  County  Jail \nuniform.  \n \nVI.  DO  I  NEED  TO  PROVE  THAT  I  WAS  STRIP-SEARCHED,  AND \nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN? \n \nIn filling out the Claim Form, you will affirm, under penalty of perjury, that you \nwere strip searched during the admission process at the Allegheny County Jail.  If your \nname is not contained in Allegheny County Jail’s records, you may be asked to provide \nadditional documentation before being allowed to participate in the Settlement.   \n \nA strip search occurred if, during the admission process, you were ordered to take \noff  some  or  all  of  your  clothes  by  an  Allegheny  County  Jail  employee,  with  that \nemployee watching you undress.  Almost all members of the Class may also have been \nforced to bend at the waist or manipulate body parts to allow for a visual inspection.  \nThese searches almost always occurred when someone received the Jail Uniform in the \nJail’s shower room.  If you were searched in this manner when you were booked into the \nfacility and meet the other eligibility criteria, you are a member of the Class and entitled \nto make a claim.  You will need to provide an affirmation on the Claim Form confirming \nthat one of these searches was conducted on you when you entered the Allegheny County \nJail. \n \nVIII.  HOW  DO  I  KNOW  WHETHER  THE  CRIME  FOR  WHICH  I  WAS \nCHARGED UPON ADMISSION TO THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL \nQUALIFIES ME FOR INCLUSION IN THE CLASS? \n \nYou were placed in the custody of the Allegheny County Jail after being charged \nwith misdemeanors; summary offenses; traffic infractions; civil commitments or other \nminor crimes; or bench warrants or probation violations where the underlying charge was \na  misdemeanor,  summary  offense  or  other  minor  crime.    Everyone  brought  to  the \nAllegheny County Jail pre-adjudication on such minor offenses and strip searched in the \nabsence of reasonable suspicion upon admission during the Class Period is eligible under \nthis Settlement Agreement. \n \n  You are eligible to make a claim on the settlement if you were charged with a \nmisdemeanor  or  summary  offense  when  you  entered  the  Allegheny  County  Jail.  \nMisdemeanors are minor crimes under Pennsylvania Law, and include charges such as \ntrespassing, simple assault and driving while intoxicated.  Summary offenses include \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 37 of 62\nregulatory offenses (hunting and fishing violations) or violations of municipal codes, \nsuch as noise or littering ordinances.   \n \nAdditionally,  you  are  eligible  under  the  Settlement  Agreement  if  you  were \nadmitted  to  the  Allegheny  County  Jail  subject  to  a  civil  commitment.    A  civil \ncommitment is an order from a non-criminal court, usually the Family Court, committing \nthat individual to the Allegheny County Jail.  Individuals admitted to the Allegheny \nCounty Jail, on a civil commitment, for example, a commitment for failure to pay child \nsupport, are members of the Class.  \n \nSimilarly, if you were arrested and brought to the Allegheny County Jail for \ntraffic  offenses  or  under  traffic  warrants,  failing  to  pay  fines  and  contempt,  pre-\nadjudication, you are eligible under the Settlement Agreement.  Consequently, if you \nfailed to honor a payment order with a municipal court and were arrested, or failed to \nappear for a municipal court date and arrested, brought to the Allegheny County Jail and \nstrip searched, you are eligible to receive a settlement payment.  \n \nIX.  I WAS ADMITTED TO THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL BUT I CAN’T \nREMEMBER WHAT MY CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE.  HOW CAN I \nFIND THIS OUT, AND HOW DO I KNOW IF THE CHARGE WAS A \nMISDEMEANOR OR VIOLATION? \n \nThere are several ways for potential Class Members to determine the nature of \ntheir criminal charges.  First, you can review your charging documents, which should \nreflect your actual charges.  If you do not have your charging document and remember \nthe local court where you were prosecuted, the Court Clerk will be able to help you find \nthese documents.   \n \nIf you need additional help determining whether you are a Class Member, or of \nyou  have  other  questions,  you  can  contact  the  Settlement  Administrator  at  [insert \nnumber].   \n \nYou can still make a claim if you do not remember your criminal charges if you \nbelieve you are a member of the Class, but you may be asked for additional information.   \n \n \n \n \nX.  I PLED GUILTY TO A CRIME.  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT MY RIGHT \nTO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \n \nIf you were admitted to the Allegheny County Jail solely on non-felony or other \nminor charges, as defined above, you can participate in the Settlement regardless of how \nyou resolved your criminal charges, including if you pled guilty to those charges.  This is \nprovided that you were admitted to the Allegheny County Jail during the Class Period \nbefore being sentenced by a court.  For most Class Members, this would mean that they \nwere committed to the Allegheny County Jail after they were arraigned before a Judge.  If \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 38 of 62\nyou were sentenced before admission to the Allegheny County Jail (meaning you were \ncommitted after pleading guilty or being convicted at trial) you are not a Class Member.   \n \nXI.    WHAT IF I WAS ADMITTED TO THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL ON \nMORE THAN ONE OCCASION DURING THE CLASS PERIOD?  CAN I \nSTILL PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \n \nYes.  Individuals who were admitted to the Allegheny County Jail on more than \none occasion during the class period can be members of the class and can recover money.  \nThey can only recover one payment, however, meaning that you will not be provided \nwith extra payments if you were admitted to the Allegheny County Jail more than one \ntime.  \n \nXII.    I AM STILL NOT SURE IF I AM INCLUDED. \n \nIf you are still not sure if you are included, you can ask for help.  You can call \n[insert number] and the Settlement Administrator or Class Counsel may help answer \nyour questions.  For more information, you can also visit the website, [INSERT], or you \ncan just fill out the Claim Form and return it to the Settlement Administrator to see if you \nqualify. \n \n \n \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS - WHAT YOU GET \n \nXIII.   WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE? \n \nDefendant has agreed to pay $3,000,000.00 (Three Million Dollars) to resolve this \nLitigation.  The money will be used to: 1) compensate Class Members who have been \nillegally  strip  searched;  2)  pay  for  notifying  Class  Members  and  administering  the \nSettlement; 3) pay incentive awards of $18,000.00 each to the named Plaintiffs Karen \nMurphy and Harry Delandro and 4) pay attorneys’ fees and expenses.       \n \nA complete description of the Settlement is provided in the Settlement Agreement.  You \ncan get a copy of the Settlement Agreement by visiting [enter website address] or by \ncalling [enter administrator phone number].   \n \n \nXIV.   WHAT CAN I GET FROM THE SETTLEMENT? \n \nThe benefits that you will receive from the Settlement:   \n \nMembers of the Class will receive an equal pro-rata share of $3,000,000.00, \nminus an incentive award for the Class Representatives, attorneys’ fees, and expenses.  \nClass  Counsel  anticipates,  based  on  claims  rates  from  other  settlements,  that  all \nindividuals who are members of the Class that make a claim on the Settlement will \nreceive between $600.00 and $900.00 as a settlement payment.  These amounts are \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 39 of 62\ndependent on how many claims are received by the Claims Administrator during the \nclaims  period,  and  are  subject  to  change based  on  the  number  of  claims  received.  \nPayments to members of the Class shall not exceed $3,000.00.  No amount is guaranteed.     \n  \n \n \nHOW YOU GET A PAYMENT - SUBMITTING A CLAIM FORM \n \n \nXV.    HOW CAN I GET A PAYMENT? \n \nTo qualify for a payment, you MUST send in a Claim Form.  A Claim Form is \nattached to this Notice.  You can also get a claim form on the Internet at [INSERT].  \nRead the instructions carefully, fill out the form, sign it, and mail it postmarked no later \nthan [insert date].   \n \nYou may be asked for additional documents, and will be contacted in writing.  \nYou may want to send in your claim form by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, \nto ensure that it is received by the Settlement Administrator.   \n \n \nXVI.   WHEN WOULD I GET MY PAYMENT? \n \nThe Court will hold a hearing on [insert date] to decide whether to approve the \nSettlement.  Because of the difficult financial situation facing Allegheny County, the \nCounty is making payments for the settlement fund in three phases.  The County is \nexpected to make two payments affecting the payments to class members, one on March \n31, 2011 and one on June 30, 2011.  All class members will be paid their settlement \npayments  prior  to  the  payment  of  expenses,  attorneys’  fees  or  incentive  awards.  \nPayments will be made to class members in the order the claim forms are received by the \nSettlement Administrator, and all payments are expected to be completed in July 2011.  \nHowever, even if Judge McVerry approves the settlement, there may be appeals.  It is \nalways uncertain whether those appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take \ntime, perhaps more than a year.  Everyone who sends in a Claim Form will be informed \nof the progress of the Settlement.  Please be patient.   \n \n \nXVII.  WHAT AM I GIVING UP TO GET A PAYMENT OR STAY IN THE \nCLASS? \n \nUnless you exclude yourself, you are staying in the Class, and that means you \ncan’t  sue,  continue  to  sue,  or  be  part  of  any  other  lawsuit  against  the  County  of \nAllegheny, its employees, or its elected officials about the legal issues in this case.  It also \nmeans that all the Court’s orders will apply to you and legally bind you.  If you sign the \nClaim Form, you will agree to release all claims that you have relating to having been \nstrip searched.   \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 40 of 62\n \nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT \n \nIf you do not want a payment from this Settlement, but you want to keep the right \nto sue or continue to sue the County of Allegheny on your own about the legal issues in \nthis case, then you must take steps to preserve these rights.  This is called excluding \nyourself - or is sometimes referred to as “opting out” of the Settlement Class.   \n \nXVIII.  HOW DO I GET OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nTo exclude yourself from the Settlement, you must send a letter by mail saying \nthat you want to be excluded from Delandro, et al. v. County of Allegheny.  Be sure to \ninclude your name, address, telephone number and your signature.  You must mail your \nexclusion request postmarked no later than [insert date] to [insert address].   \n \nYou can’t exclude yourself on the phone or by email.  If you ask to be excluded, \nyou will not get any settlement payment, and you cannot object to the Settlement.  You \nwill not be legally bound by anything that happens in this lawsuit.  You may be able to \nsue (or continue to sue) the County of Allegheny in the future.   \n \nXIX.   IF I DO NOT EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I SUE THE COUNTY OF \nALLEGHENY FOR THE SAME THING LATER? \n \nNo.  Unless you exclude yourself, you give up the right to sue the County of \nAllegheny for the claims that this Settlement involves.  If you have a pending lawsuit, \nspeak to your lawyer in that lawsuit immediately.  You must exclude yourself from this \nclass action to continue your own lawsuit.  Remember, the exclusion deadline is [insert \ndate].   \n \n \nXX.  IF I EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I GET MONEY FROM THE \nSETTLEMENT? \n \nNo.  If you exclude yourself, do not send in a Claim Form to ask for money.  But, \nyou may sue, continue to sue, or be part of a different lawsuit against the County of \nAllegheny.   \n \n \nTHE LAWYERS AND INDIVIDUALS  \nREPRESENTING YOU \n \nXXI.   DO I HAVE A LAWYER IN THIS CASE? \n \nThe Court approved Robert Peirce and Associates; Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & \nBerman, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Mason, LLP, Washington, DC; The Law Offices of \nElmer Robert Keach, III, PC, Amsterdam, New York; and Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, \nLLP, Washington, DC to represent you and other Class Members.  Together, the lawyers \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 41 of 62\nare called Class Counsel.  You will not be charged for these lawyers.  If you want to be \nrepresented by your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense.   \n \nXXII.  HOW WILL THE LAWYERS AND THE CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \nBE  PAID? \n \nClass Counsel will ask the Court for attorneys’ fees and expenses as a percentage \nof the $3,000,000.00 (Three Million Dollars) settlement, and a payment of $18,000.00 \n(Eighteen Thousand Dollars) each for Class Representatives Karen Murphy and Harry \nDelandro.  The Settlement Agreement provides that thirty-three and one-third  (33 1/3) \npercent of the Settlement Fund will be paid to Class Counsel as an award of attorneys’ \nfees, together with an award for the reimbursement of expenses.  These amounts will be \ndeducted from the Settlement Fund before payments are made to Class Members.  The \ncosts of administering the Settlement, which are estimated at $__________, will also be \ndeducted from the Settlement Fund.   \n \n \nOBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT \n \nYou can tell the Court that you do not agree with the Settlement or some part of it.   \n \nXXIII. HOW DO I TELL THE COURT THAT I DO NOT LIKE THE \nSETTLEMENT? \n \nIf you are a Class Member, you can object to the Settlement if you don’t like any \npart of it.  You can give objections why you think the Court should not approve it.  The \nCourt will consider your views.  To object, you must send a letter saying that you object \nto Delandro, et al. v. County of Allegheny to include your name, address, telephone \nnumber, your signature, and the reasons why you object to this Settlement and the case \nnumber (06-cv-927).  Mail the objection to these three different places postmarked no \nlater than [insert date].  \n \nCOURT   \nU.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania \nOffice of the Clerk of Court  700 Grant Street \nPittsburgh, PA 15219 \n \nCLASS COUNSEL         \nD.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBJECTING AND \nEXCLUDING MYSELF? \n \nObjecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like something about the \nSettlement.  You can object only if you stay in the Class.  Excluding yourself is telling \nthe Court that you do not want to be a part of the Class.  If you exclude yourself, you \nhave no basis to object because the case no longer legally affects you.   \n \n \n \nTHE COURT’S FAIRNESS HEARING \n \nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the Settlement.  You \nmay attend and you may ask to speak, but you do not have to do so.   \n \nXXV.  WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE COURT DECIDE WHETHER TO \nAPPROVE THE SETTLEMENT? \n \nOn [insert date] the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania \nwill hold a fairness hearing in the Federal Courthouse, 700 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA \n15219, in Courtroom [insert courtroom] to determine whether the Class was properly \ncertified and whether the proposed Settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.  The \nCourt will listen to people who have asked to speak at the hearing.  The Court may also \ndecide how much to pay Class Counsel.  This hearing may be continued or rescheduled \nby the Court without further notice.   We do not know how long it will take the Court to \ngive its decision.   \n \nXXVI.  DO I HAVE TO COME TO THE HEARING? \n \nNo.  Class Counsel will answer questions Judge McVerry may have.  But you are \nwelcome to come at your own expense.  If you send an objection, you do not have to \ncome to Court to talk about it.  As long as you mailed your written objection on time, the \nCourt will consider it.  You may also pay your own lawyer to attend, but it is not \nrequired.   \n \nXXVII.  MAY I SPEAK AT THE HEARING? \n \nYou may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing.  To do so, \nyou must send a letter saying that it is your “Notice of Intention to Appear in Delandro, \net al. v. County of Allegheny” case no. 06-cv-927.

You cannot speak at this hearing if you excluded yourself. \n \n  IF YOU DO NOTHING \n \nXXVIII.  WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOTHING AT ALL? \n \nIf you do nothing, you will get no money from the Settlement.  But, unless you \nexclude yourself, you will not be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be \npart of any other lawsuit against the County of Allegheny about the legal issues in this \ncase, ever again.  Unless you exclude yourself, you need to file a claim to receive a \nmonetary payment under the Settlement.   \n \nGETTING MORE INFORMATION \n \nXXIX.  ARE THERE MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT? \n \nThis  Notice  summarizes  the  proposed  Settlement.    More  details  are  in  a \nSettlement Agreement.  You can get a copy of the Settlement Agreement by writing to \nthe Settlement Administrator at [insert address] or by visiting [insert web address].   \n \nXXX.

McVerry, U.S.D.J. \non __________________, 2010, pursuant to this Court's Order of ______________________, in \norder for this Court to conduct a Final Fairness Hearing to determine whether the proposed \nSettlement Agreement between the Parties is fair, reasonable and adequate, and to address Class \nCounsel's application for an award of attorney's fees and costs; and the Settlement Class Members \nbeing represented by Class Counsel and Defendant being represented by its attorney; AND THE \nCOURT  having  read  and  considered  the  Settlement  Agreement,  the  Notice  Plan,  and \nMemorandum of Law submitted by Class Counsel, having received evidence at the hearing, \nhaving heard arguments from Class Counsel and the Defendant, and having considered the \nsubmissions by Class Members, now makes the following: \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1.  This action was commenced on July 13, 2006, as a Class Action. \n2.  After  several  years  of  intensive  litigation,  including  extensive  discovery  and \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 46 of 62\nmotion practice, and as a result of intensive, arm's length negotiations between Class Counsel and \nDefendant, including settlement conferences before former Magistrate Judge Kenneth J. Benson, \nthe Parties have reached accord with respect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to \nSettlement Class Members, in return for a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in this case \nagainst the Defendant (\"Settlement Agreement\").  The resulting Settlement Agreement was \npreliminarily approved by the Court on _____________. \n3.  As  part  of  the  Order  Granting  Preliminary  Approval,  this  Court  approved  a \nproposed Notice Plan and Class Notice, which provided Settlement Class Members notice of the \nproposed Settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an opportunity for Class Members to file \nobjections to the Settlement, and an opportunity to opt out of the Settlement. \n4.  As of the deadline for the filing of objections, no objections were filed.  Given the \nsize of this Settlement, and the Notice Plan described above, this Court finds that the absence of \nobjections is indicative of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement with the \nDefendant. \n5.  The settling Parties have filed with the Court an affidavit declaring that the mailing \nof the Court approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan, has been completed. \n6.  The Court finds that the published notice, mailed notice and Internet posting \nconstitute  the  best  practicable  notice  of  the  Fairness  Hearing,  proposed  Settlement,  Class \nCounsel's application for fees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class Notice and \nShort Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all members \nof the Settlement Class, and complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, the laws of Pennsylvania and any other \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 47 of 62\napplicable law. \n7.  Any persons who wished to be excluded from this action were provided an \nopportunity  to  \"opt  out\"  pursuant  to  the  Notice.    All  persons  who  have  validly  excluded \nthemselves from the action have no rights under the Settlement Agreement and shall not be bound \nby the Settlement Agreement or the final judgment herein and the names of those persons are set \nforth in Exhibit A hereto.  \n8.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the: Settlement, Settlement Agreement, \nRelease  contained  within  the  Settlement  Agreement,  and  the  Final  Order  and  Judgment. \nSettlement Class Members do not have a further opportunity to opt out of this Action. \n9.  Any Class Member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to the \nSettlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Class Counsel's application \nfor fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Class Notice and \nmandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed to have waived \nany such objection by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise. \n10.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable and \nadequate compromise of the claims against the Defendant in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the Court has considered \nin affirming this Settlement, including: \na.    The  liability  issues  in  this  case  have  been  vigorously \ncontested; \n \nb.    This Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class \nMembers  now,  without  further  litigation,  under \ncircumstances where the liability issues are still vigorously \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 48 of 62\ncontested  among  the  Parties  to  this  litigation.    This \nSettlement  provides  Class  Members  with  a  substantial \nmonetary benefit; and, \n \nc.    This Settlement is clearly a product of hard fought litigation \nbetween the Parties, and not a result of any collusion on the \npart of Class Counsel or Counsel for the Defendant. \n \n11.  Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendant their application \nfor reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses consistent with the terms of the Settlement \nAgreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request and hereby grants the request. \n12.  The  claims  procedure  established  under  the  Settlement  Agreement  is  fair,  a \nsimplified process, and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work out any \nunanticipated problems. \n \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF \nFACT, THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS OF LAW: \n13.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  Parties  and  the  subject  matter  of  this \nproceeding. \n14.  Pursuant  to  Rule  23  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  the  following \nSettlement Class is certified for purposes of final settlement: \nSettlement Class: \nAll persons who have been incarcerated at the Allegheny County \nJail commencing on July 13, 2004 and continuing to March 18, \n2008 who, after being charged but not convicted of misdemeanors, \nsummary offenses, civil commitments and traffic infractions as \ndefined by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as well \nas parole or probation violations where the underlying offense is a \nmisdemeanor, summary offense or traffic infraction who, pursuant \nto the policy of Allegheny County, have been strip searched upon \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 49 of 62\ntheir  entry  into  the  Allegheny  County  jail  without  reasonable \nsuspicion. \n \n15.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule 23 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a Class Action is an appropriate \nmethod for resolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for class certification \nunder Rule 23 are present.  The Class Members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined.  \nQuestions of law and fact common to all Class Members predominate over individual issues and \nshould  be  determined  in  one  proceeding  with  respect  to  all  Class  Members.    The  Class \nRepresentatives' claims are typical of those of the Class.  The Class Action mechanism is superior \nto alternative means for adjudicating and resolving this action. \n16.  The Settlement Class Representatives, Karen Murphy and Harry Delandro, are \nentitled to and are hereby awarded a payment of $18,000.00 each, in recognition of the efforts they \nundertook in connection with this lawsuit. All Class Members who have made claims on the \nsettlement are entitled to receive their pro rata share of the Settlement fund, as members of \nSubclass I not to exceed $3,000.00, after administrative expenses, attorneys' fees and expenses, \nand incentive awards are deducted from the fund.  \n17.   Any unused monies will be donated to the Neighborhood Legal Services of \nAllegheny County.  \n18.  Class Counsel are qualified, experienced, and have aggressively litigated this case, \nthereby demonstrating their adequacy as counsel for the Settlement Class.  D.

LaDuca, Esquire and Alexandra Warren, Esquire of Cuneo \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 50 of 62\nGilbert & LaDuca, LLP, Washington, DC; Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire; Law Offices of \nElmer Robert Keach, III, Amsterdam, New York; and Gary E. Mason, Esquire and Nicholas A. \nMigliaccio, Esquire, Mason, LLP are hereby appointed as counsel for the Settlement Class. \n19.  The Court grants final approval of the  Settlement  Agreement,  as  being  fair, \nreasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n20.  The Courts finds that the request for attorneys' fees is reasonable. \n \n  NOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF \nFACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND \nDECREED AS FOLLOWS: \n1.  The Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed Settlement is GRANTED. \n2.  All Class Members who have not timely filed an opt out request are barred and \nenjoined from commencing and/or prosecuting any claim or action against the Defendant.  Any \nClass Member who has not timely filed a request to exclude themselves shall be enjoined from \ninitiating and/or proceeding as a class action in any forum. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nDated: ___________         ____________________________________ \nThe Honorable Terrence McVerry \nUnited States District Judge \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 51 of 62\nEXHIBIT D \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 52 of 62\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA \n \n \nHARRY  DELANDRO  and  KAREN     \nMURPHY, individually and on behalf of a   \nClass of others similarly situated,   \n     \n \n    Plaintiffs,  Civil Action No.:  2:06-CV-927 \n \n  vs. \n \nTHE COUNTY OF ALLEGHENY, \n \n    Defendant. \n \n \nORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING SETTLEMENT \n \nWHEREAS,  the  Plaintiffs  and  Defendant  have  entered  into  a  Settlement \nAgreement intended to resolve the litigation pending in this Court; and  \nWHEREAS, the Settlement Agreement, together with supporting materials, sets \nforth the terms and conditions for a proposed Settlement and dismissal with prejudice of \nthese actions against the Defendant; and  \nWHEREAS, the Court has before it the Parties’ Notice for Preliminary Approval of \nSettlement  and  Memorandum  in  Support  of  Motion  for  Preliminary  Approval  of \nSettlement, together with the Settlement Agreement and supporting materials; and  \nWHEREAS, the Court is satisfied that the terms and conditions set forth in the \nSettlement Agreement were the result of good faith, arm’s length settlement negotiations \nbetween competent and experienced counsel for both Plaintiffs and Defendant. \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 53 of 62\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED AS FOLLOWS: \n1.

If you meet the criteria explained below, you can share in \nthis Settlement.  \n \nThe United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania authorized this \nnotice.  The Court will have a hearing to decide whether to approve the Settlement, so that the \nbenefits may be paid.   \n \nWho’s Included?\n \n \nYou are a Class Member and could get benefits if: \n \n1.  You entered the Allegheny County Jail; AND \n \n2.  You were placed in the custody of the Allegheny County Jail after being \ncharged with misdemeanors; summary offenses; traffic infractions; civil \ncommitments or other minor crimes; or bench warrants or probation \nviolations where the underlying charge was a misdemeanor, summary \noffense or other minor crime; AND \n \n3.  You were strip searched upon entry to the Allegheny County Jail without \nreasonable cause; AND \n \n4.  You were strip searched during the period of July 13, 2004 through March \n18, 2008. \n \nWhat’s This About?\n \n \nThe lawsuit claims that the Defendant County of Allegheny unlawfully strip searched everyone \nadmitted into the Allegheny County Jail on only minor charges.  The County of Allegheny has \ndenied those claims.  Both sides agreed to the Settlement to ensure a resolution and to provide \nbenefits to the people who were affected.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 151-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 62 of 62\n \nWhat Does the Settlement Provide?\n \n \nDefendant agreed to pay a total of $3,000,000.00 to settle the case. That will pay for the claims of \nthe Class Representatives, the administrative costs of the Settlement, an incentive award to the \nClass  Representatives,  and  the  attorneys’  fees  and  expenses.  There  are  believed  to  be \napproximately 12,600 Class Members.  You can only make one claim, even if you were strip \nsearched more than once.  Each Class Member who makes a claim will receive an equal share of \nthe portion of the Settlement Fund allocated to pay the claims of members of the Class.  Class \nCounsel anticipates, based on claims rates from other settlements, that all individuals who are \nmembers of will receive between $600.00 and $900.00 as a settlement payment. These amounts \nare dependent on how many claims are received by the Claims Administrator during the claims \nperiod, and are subject to change based the number of claims received.  No amount is guaranteed. \n \nHow Do You Ask For A Payment? \n \nA  detailed  Notice  and  Claim  Form  package  contains  everything  you  need.    Just  call \n1-800-XXX-XXXX or visit the settlement website, XXXXXXX, to get one.  To qualify for a \npayment, you must send in a Claim Form.  Claim forms are due by [insert date], 2010.   \n \nWhat Are Your Other Options? \n \nIf you want to share in the Settlement, all you need to do is obtain a Claim Form, as just explained, \nand return it according to its directions.  If you don’t want the Settlement benefits or don’t want to \nbe legally bound by the Settlement, you must exclude yourself by [insert date] 2010.  If you \nexclude yourself, you can’t get any benefits from this Settlement, but you could bring a separate \ncase against the Defendant, if you want to.  If you stay in the Settlement, you may object to it by \n[insert date] 2010.  The detailed notice, available by calling or visiting the website below, \nexplains how to exclude yourself or object.   \n \nThe court will hold a hearing in this case (Delandro, et al.  v. County of Allegheny, Case No. \n2:06-cv-927 on [insert date], to consider whether to approve the Settlement and a request by the \nlawyers  representing  all  Class  Members  (D.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23, Plaintiffs request this Court give Final Approval of the Class Settlement and \ncertify the action pursuant to Rule 23. \nI.   PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n  On September 10, 2010, Plaintiffs and Defendant executed a Settlement to resolve the \nabove matter for a total of $3,000,000.00 million.  On September 15, 2010, Plaintiffs moved this \nCourt for an Order preliminarily approving the Settlement and authorizing Plaintiffs and \nDefendant to provide Notice to the Class.  Pursuant to Plaintiffs’ motion, on September 30, 2010, \nthis Court preliminarily approved the Settlement including the Notice.  Pursuant to this Court’s \n 1 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 2 of 13\nOrder, the Settlement Administrator sent Notice out to the Class on November 29, 2010 by way \nof regular mail.  See Affidavit of Frank Barkan (“Barkan Aff.”) (Dkt. No. 158-2).  All mail that \nwas undeliverable because of inaccurate addresses was investigated to ascertain the correct \naddress and re-mailed to the members of the Class using a locater database.  Id. at ¶ 2.  Further, \nPlaintiffs and Defendant also provided Notice by way of newspaper publication and television.  \nFinally, the Settlement Administrator created and implemented of telephone program using both \ninteractive Voice Response technology and live operators.  Id.   \n  The response to the Class Settlement by the Class has been overwhelmingly positive.  As \nof this filing, there have been over 2,085 (unverified) claim forms submitted pursuant to the \nSettlement, resulting in a claims rate of approximately 17%.  Barkan Aff. at ¶ 2.  Therefore, the \nClass has participated at a high rate.  Further, of this filing, only five members of the Class have \nopted out, and only one Class Member has objected.  See Affirmation of Lead Counsel Elmer \nRobert Keach, III in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement \n(“Keach Aff.”) at ¶ 10.  (Dkt. No. 158-1).     \nII.  BRIEF FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE \nThe Plaintiffs brought an action against the Defendant asserting the Defendant \nmaintained an unconstitutional strip search policy and practice throughout the Class Period.  \nPlaintiffs allege that detainees admitted on misdemeanor or lesser offenses were strip-searched in \nthe absence of individualized reasonable suspicion after being transported to the County of \nAllegheny County Jail (“Jail”).  Testimony of Allegheny County Jail personnel confirmed these \nallegations.  These strip-searches involved a visual inspection of detainees’ naked bodies and of \ntheir body cavities by a same-sex correctional officer in the privacy of a shower stall.  To \nfacilitate an inspection of body cavities, detainees were required to manipulate their genitalia and \n 2 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 3 of 13\nbuttocks, and “squat and cough” in view of a corrections officer.  Female detainees were also \nrequired to manipulate their breasts. The deposition testimony of the prison officers confirms this \npractice.  \nIn prosecution of these claims over four years, Class Counsel have reviewed hundreds of \ndocuments, have taken and defended numerous depositions, and have interviewed many fact \nwitnesses.  Class Counsel also participated in several court proceedings, and filed and defended \nmultiple substantive motions before the Court.  On March 24, 2010, after many months of \nnegotiations and with the help of Magistrate Judge Robert C. Mitchell and retired Magistrate \nJudge Kenneth J. Benson, Plaintiffs and Defendant settled the matter.  During the course of these \nnegotiations, the County agreed to change its strip-search policies, and stopped conducting \nblanket strip-searches on misdemeanor detainees.  The procedure developed by the County for its \nintake of detainees into the Jail facilities is a model policy, in that it balances the need of the \nCounty to keep contraband from entering the Jail at the same time it recognizes the rights of \ndetainees for bodily privacy.  Although these lengthy and complex negotiations have been \ndifficult, the Parties' good-faith efforts to resolve this Litigation ultimately resulted in an arms-\nlength Settlement representing a thoughtful compromise (which takes into consideration the \nParties respective concerns – a meaningful solution to the constitutional violations incurred by \nthe members of the Class and the County of Allegheny’s financial situation). In short, Plaintiffs \nrespectfully submit that this Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate for the Settlement Class, \nand that the requirements for final approval are satisfied.   \nIII.  THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nPlaintiffs are pleased to present to the Court Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s Motion for Final \nApproval of the Settlement of this Litigation. This Settlement is made on behalf of all persons \n 3 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 4 of 13\nadmitted to the Jail between July 13, 2004 and March 18, 2008 after being charged with \nmisdemeanor offenses (or other minor crimes) and who were subsequently strip searched upon \ntheir entry into the Jail.  \nAll persons who have been incarcerated at the Allegheny County \nJail commencing on July 13, 2004 and continuing to March 18, \n2008 who, after being charged but not convicted of misdemeanors, \nsummary offenses, civil commitments and traffic infractions as \ndefined by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as well \nas parole or probation violations where the underlying offense is a \nmisdemeanor, summary offense or traffic infraction, pursuant to \nthe policy of Allegheny County, have been strip searched upon \ntheir  entry  into  the  Allegheny  County  Jail  without  reasonable \nsuspicion. \n \nAs described below, the Settlement Agreement provides for the creation of a Settlement \nFund to compensate the Settlement Class for these constitutional violations. \nA.  The Settlement Fund  \n  The Settlement creates a Settlement Fund of $3,000,000.00.  Class members will receive \ntheir pro rata share of the Settlement Fund after the payment of attorneys’ fees, expenses, \nincentive awards, and administrative and Notice expenses.  Given the claims rate to date, and \nassuming an ultimate claims rate of 20%, Class Counsel estimates that each Class Member will \nreceive a pro rata payment of $662.77.  See Keach Aff. at ¶ 13.   \nClass Counsel will also seek thirty-three and a third percent (33 1/3%) of the Settlement \nFund for attorneys’ fees pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.  Class Counsel is filing a petition \nfor attorneys’ fees simultaneously with this motion for final approval of the settlement. \nIV.  LEGAL ARGUMENT \nThe Third Circuit requires that before a Class Settlement Agreement is approved, the \nCourt must find that the Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  See Girsh v. Jepson, 521 \nF.2d 153 (3d Cir. 1975).  The Court must then find the class meets the requirements set forth \n 4 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 5 of 13\nunder Rule 23 and if it does, certify the class.  As will be demonstrated below, Plaintiffs’ and \nDefendant’s Settlement Agreement meets this burden.  Final approval should be granted and the \nSettlement Class should be certified. \n     A.   The Settlement Agreement Should Be Approved By the Court \n \nIn this motion, Plaintiffs seek Final Approval of the Settlement Agreement between \nPlaintiffs and the Defendant. \"Compromises of disputed claims are favored by the courts.\"  \nWilliams v. First Nat'l Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595 (1910); In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales \nPractice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 317 (3d Cir. 1998) (\"Prudential II”).  The \nSettlement spares the litigants the uncertainty, delay and expense of a trial, while simultaneously \nreducing the burden on judicial resources.  Federal Rule 23(e) provides that the Court must \napprove any Settlement of a Class action. In a Class action, the \"court plays the important role of \nprotector of the [absent members'] interests, in a sort of fiduciary capacity.\" In re Gen. Motors \nCorp. Pick-up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 785 (3rd Cir. 1995) (\"GM \nTrucks\").  The ultimate determination whether a proposed Class action Settlement warrants \napproval resides in the Court's discretion.  See Protective Comm. for Indep. S'holders of TMT \nTrailer Ferry, Inc. v. Anderson, 390 U.S. 414, 424-25 (1968).  A Class Settlement should be \napproved when the court finds it is fair, reasonable and adequate.  See Fry v. Hayt, Hayt & \nLandau, 198 F.R.D. 461, 470 (E.D. Pa. 2000). \nThe Third Circuit has adopted a nine-factor test to determine whether a Class Settlement \nis fair, reasonable and adequate:  \n“…(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation…; (2) \nthe reaction of the Class to the Settlement…; (3) the stage of the \nproceedings and the amount of discovery completed…; (4) the risks of \nestablishing liability…’ (5) the risks of establishing damages…(6) the \nrisks of maintaining the Class action through trial…; (7) the ability of the \nDefendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of \n 5 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 6 of 13\nreasonableness of the Settlement fund in light of the best possible \nrecovery…; (9) the range of reasonableness of the Settlement fund to a \npossible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation…” \n \nGirsh, 521 F.2d at 157. \nPlaintiffs’ and Defendant’s Settlement meets this burden. \n1.  The Complexity, Expenses and Likely Duration of the \nLitigation Support Final Approval \n \nAs stated above, Plaintiffs began this action on July 13, 2006.  Class Counsel have \nconducted numerous depositions and also have filed a motion for summary judgment, motion for \nclass certification and motion for preliminary injunction.  Class Counsel have interviewed over \nnumerous Class Members in investigating the Class in support of Plaintiffs’ motion for class \ncertification.  In all, Plaintiffs’ counsel has incurred a cumulative lodestar $1,258,165.00 on this \ncase.  Keach Aff. at ¶ 11 attached.  Further, Class Counsel has out-of-pocket costs in excess of $ \n148,722.17, although a significant portion of these expenses is the result of Class Counsel paying \nfor the initial administrative expenses of the settlement.  Id. at ¶ 12. \nPlaintiffs sought a sound and efficient resolution of the claims through settlement, in part, \nbecause of their awareness that the Third Circuit had granted review of a similar case on the \nissue of liability and that the Class could soon have no viable claims.  Plaintiffs’ reasoning \nproved sound.   After the parties reached a settlement, the Third Circuit held that a blanket policy \nof strip-searching all non-indictable arrestees admitted to a jail facility without first articulating \nreasonable suspicion does not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Florence v. Bd. Of Chosen \nFreeholders of Co. of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296, 310 (3d Cir. 2010).  Thus, in the absence of a \nsettlement, class members, who present nearly identical allegations as those in Florence, would \n 6 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 7 of 13\nvery likely not have viable claims and would therefore receive no compensation.1  In light of \nFlorence and based on the experience of Class Counsel, the Settlement of $3,000,000.00 million \nprovided certainty to Class Members and provided a fair and reasonable result for the outcome.  \nSee In Re Automotive Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation, 617 F. Supp. 2d 336, 341 (E.D. Pa. \n2007) (judgment of experienced counsel supported providing final approval for Settlement).   \nThis is especially so given the County’s financial situation, and its lack of insurance coverage.  \nIn sum, Class Counsel in this case weighed the risks of proceeding further with litigation with \nthe benefit of receiving a Settlement and concluded it was in the Class members’ best interest to \nresolve this matter at this juncture.  Therefore, the Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.   \n2.  The Reaction of the Class Justifies Final Approval \nUnder the second Girsh factor, the reaction of the Class is evidence as whether the \nSettlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  See Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 318; In Re Automotive \nRefinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation, 617 F. Supp. 2d at 342.   \nPursuant to this Court’s Order of preliminary approval and the agreed upon notice \nprogram, Plaintiffs provided to the Class through the Settlement Administrator.  See Barkan Aff.   \nThe Settlement Administrator arranged for the printing and mailing of a Notice and Proof of \nClaim Form to the approximately 12,398 Class Members.  Id. at ¶ 2.  The Settlement \nAdministrator coordinated the publication of the Summary Notice in various newspapers, and \ncoordinated the implementation of television commercials pursuant to the agreed upon Notice \nprogram.  Id.  The Settlement Administrator also contracted with a website administrator to \n                                                 \n1 It bears mentioning that class counsel in Florence have filed a petition for writ of certiorari \nwith the U.S. Supreme Court.  Any given petition, however, has less than a one percent chance \nof being granted.  See Journal of the Supreme Court of the United States, October Term 2005, at \nII (2006), http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/journal/jnl05.pdf (documenting that of the \n8,521 cases docketed during the October 2005 term, only 78 cases were granted plenary review). \n 7 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 8 of 13\ndevelop a dedicated website for the Settlement.  Id.   \nFinally, Plaintiffs have received 2,085 claim forms from unverified class members with a \ndesire to participate in this Settlement.  Id.  This represents overwhelming support for the Class.  \nThe fact that only one Class member filed an objection is a significant element to consider when \nassessing the fairness of the Settlement.  See In Re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 264 (3d \nCir. 2001).  \nOnly five Class members have decided to opt out of the settlement.  Keach Aff. at ¶ Id.  \nOnly one has objected to the Settlement.  Id.  This objection, lodged by class member April \nTaylor, is without merit since it alleges that the settlement does not offer her sufficient \ncompensation for her injuries.  Keach Aff. at ¶ 10.  Absent the class settlement, class members \nwould most likely receive nothing since the given the Third Circuit’s decision in Florence.   \n      3.  The Stage of the Proceeding and Amount of Discovery Favor \nFinal Approval \n \nIt has been generally understood by the Third Circuit that settlements that are made after \ndiscovery reflect the true value of the claim.  See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, \n1314 (3d Cir. 1993).  Plaintiffs and Defendant in this case completed discovery.  Class Counsel \ntook numerous depositions and reviewed hundreds of documents regarding the admittance of \npretrial detainees at the Jail.  Since Plaintiffs prosecuted this action and completed discovery \nbefore resolving the claims of the Class, this weighs heavily in favor of approving the Settlement \nas fair, reasonable and adequate.  Id. \n4.  The Risks of Establishing Liability and Damages Weigh in \nFavor of Approving Settlement. \n \nThe risks of establishing liability and damages are the fourth and fifth factors to be \nweighed when evaluating a Settlement.  See In Re Automotive Refinishing Paint Antitrust \n 8 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 9 of 13\nLitigation, 617 F. Supp. 2d at 343.  This factor in and of itself counsels for approval of this \nSettlement.  After the parties reached a settlement, the Third Circuit held that a blanket policy of \nstrip-searching all non-indictable arrestees admitted to a jail facility without first articulating \nreasonable suspicion does not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Florence, 621 F.3d at 310.  In \nother words, in the absence of a settlement, Class Members would likely not have viable claims \nand would receive no compensation.  \nIn this case, the Settlement provides class members with a $3,000,000.00 fund.  Their \nSettlement clearly meets the standard of fairness, reasonableness and adequacy as found by \ncourts in similar Settlements.  Class Counsel estimates that Class members will receive \napproximately $662.77.  Keach Off. at ¶ 13. \n5.  The Risks of Maintaining a Class Action Through Trial Weigh \nin Favor of Approving this Settlement \n \nGiven the Florence decision, the risks of maintaining a Class through trial support \napproval of the Settlement.  See Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 321.  In light of the fact that the Third \nCircuit has found that a district court always possesses the authority to decertify an action, this \nfactor in and of itself weighs in favor of Settlement.  “Consistent with this reality, we are \nsatisfied that the inherent difficulties of bringing a Class action to trial weighs in favor of \napproving the Settlements.”  In Re Automotive Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation, 617 \nF.Supp. 2d at 344.  This Court should find that this factor weighs strongly in favor of approving \nthe Settlement. \n6.  The Ability of Defendants to Withstand Greater Judgment \n \n  Under the seventh Girsh factor, it must be considered whether the Defendant could \nwithstand a greater judgment.  See In Re Diet Drugs Products Liability Litigation, 2000 WL \n1222042 at *62 (E.D. Pa. August 28, 2000).  In this case, the Defendant, the County of \n 9 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 10 of 13\nAllegheny, has suffered, as have most municipalities, from the current economic conditions. Due \nto the realities of the environment, this factor weighs heavily in finding that the Settlement for \n$3,000,000.00 million is fair, reasonable and adequate. \n7.   The Reasonableness of the Settlement in Light of the Best \nPossible Recovery Weighs in Favor of Approving this \nSettlement \n \nThe final two Girsh factors require the court to determine whether Plaintiffs settled for \nappropriate value in light of the Class members’ damages.  See In Re Automotive Refinishing \nPaint Antitrust Litigation, 617 F. Supp. 2d at 344.  This matter settled for $3,000,000.00 million.  \nEach Class member will receive approximately$662.77.  Under Third Circuit precedent \ndelivered after the settlement was reached, Plaintiffs would be most likely be unable to state \nviable claims and would receive no compensation.  In addition, in settlements of similar actions, \nClass members have received comparable amounts.  As is demonstrated by the above analysis of \nthe Girsh factors, the Settlement is clearly an excellent result and is fair, reasonable and adequate \nunder Girsh. \nB.  Final Certification of the Proposed Settlement Class is Appropriate to                                      \nResolve All Strip-search Claims Against Defendant \n  \nAlthough the Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, the Settlement Class still must \nbe certified pursuant to Rule 23.  Both the Supreme Court and various circuit courts have \nrecognized that the benefits of a proposed Settlement of a Class action can only be realized \nthrough the certification of a Settlement Class.  See Amchem Prods. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 \n(1997); Prudential II, 148 F.3d 283; Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir. 1998).   \nGiven that this case has already been certified the Court for trial purposes, there can be \nlittle question that the Settlement Class readily meets the necessary criteria of numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy.  See Dkt. No. 99.  Since the Settlement Class consists of \n 10 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 11 of 13\napproximately 12,398 individuals, there is no question that the element of numerosity has been \nmet. The commonality and typicality requirements are also easily satisfied, as the claims of the \nClass Representatives and the Settlement Class are premised upon the same blanket strip-search \nand bail policy and practice. Finally, adequacy of representation is assured as the Settlement \nClass is represented by counsel who have a wealth of experience in complex civil rights \nlitigation.  \nCertification of a Class under Rule 23(b)(3) for Settlement of the compensatory damages \nclaims is also appropriate because such relief is premised on the common constitutional \nviolations visited on the Settlement Class by the Defendant’s allegedly unlawful strip-search \npolicy.  There is no danger that individual variations in the type or magnitude of damage suffered \nby individual Class members will affect predominance, as the Representative Plaintiffs have \nsuffered the same type of damages -- and seek the same type of relief -- as members of the \nproposed Settlement Class.  Moreover, resolution of this Litigation by a Class Settlement is \nsuperior to the individual adjudication of Class members' claims for compensatory relief.  In \nparticular, the Settlement provides the Settlement Class with an ability to obtain prompt, \npredictable and certain compensatory relief, and contains well defined administrative procedures \nto assure due process in the application of the agreement to each individual claimant including \nthe right to \"opt-out.\" By contrast, individualized litigation here carries with it near certainty of \nthat individuals would receive no compensation given the Third Circuit’s recently holding in \nFlorence.   \nOther federal courts, in considering the situation where cities or counties have employed \nblanket search policies, have consistently recognized the propriety of certifying such cases as \n 11 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 160    Filed 02/25/11   Page 12 of 13\nClass actions and the decisions certifying such cases are legion.2  In sum, given that the Court \nhas already certified this Class for trial, the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) are satisfied and \ncertification of the proposed Settlement Class is appropriate.  \nV.     CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs and Defendant respectfully request that this Court \nenter an Order that: (1) provides final approval to the Settlement as fair, reasonable and \nadequate, and (2) certifies the Class for settlement purposes pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) \nfor the purpose of effectuating a Class action Settlement of the claims against the Defendant.   \n          Respectfully Submitted By \n             /s Elmer Robert Keach, III \nDated:  February 25, 2011      ___________________________________ \n  Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire (Lead Counsel) \n  Member of the Bar, United States District Court \n  for the Western District of Pennsylvania \nLAW OFFICES OF ELMER ROBERT  \nKEACH, III, PC \n1040 Riverfront Center \nPost Office Box 70 \nAmsterdam, NY  12010 \n518.434.1718 \n \nD.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \n  Plaintiffs submit this consolidated brief in response to Defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment and in further support of Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on liability.  \nDefendants’ response to Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment and Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment largely rehash the same meritless arguments that Defendants \nmade – and the Court rejected -- in opposition to class certification.  Specifically, Defendants \nargue: 1) that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a custom or policy of blanket strip searches \nfor all pre-trial detainees who are admitted into the Allegheny County Jail (“ACJ”); 2) that \nAllegheny County does not have an illegal blanket strip search policy because it employs a \nmulti-stage procedure of admitting detainees; 3) that the caselaw supposedly permits blanket \nstrip searches of pre-trial detainees without reasonable suspicion; 4) that the representative \nPlaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment because a) Mr. Delandro was on crutches and \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 2 of 13\nwore a foot immobilizer, and b) there is purportedly no record of Ms. Murphy’s admission to the \nAllegheny.   \nDefendants further contend that the individual defendants should be dismissed because of \nthe doctrine of qualified immunity.  While Plaintiffs do not agree with Defendants’ argument \nconcerning qualified immunity, they will nevertheless agree to dismiss the individual defendants \ngiven the County’s direct liability for their admitted blanket strip search policy and practice.  \nDefendants remaining arguments lack merit, and for the following reasons detailed further \nbelow, must fail.   \n  The Plaintiffs have amply demonstrated the existence of blanket strip search policy at the \nACJ through FRCP 30(b)(6) deposition testimony; a written policy promulgated by Allegheny \nCounty, and through the depositions of various Corrections Officers who work at the ACJ.  They \nhave also demonstrated this blanket policy in sworn testimony before the Court during a \npreliminary injunction hearing.  The so-called multi-stage admissions process does not immunize \nAllegheny County from liability because all class members are stripped searched without \nreasonable suspicion after being charged only with minor offenses regardless of the multi-stage \nadmissions process. \n  Additionally, the limited decisions cited by Defendants in support of their request for \nsummary judgment are unavailing because they represent factually distinguishable situations or \nare otherwise wrongly decided—nearly all of them are also from outside this judicial circuit.  \nThe near-unanimous authority holds that blanket strip searches of pretrial detainees are \nunconstitutional, and yesterday’s Supreme Court decision in Safford Unified Sch. Dist. #1 v. \nRedding, ___ S.Ct. ___, 2009 WL 1789472 (2009) reaffirmed the requirement that strip searches \nmust be supported by reasonable suspicion.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 3 of 13\n  In short, the representative Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on liability \nbecause they were both strip searched pursuant to Allegheny County’s blanket policy without \nreasonable suspicion.        \nII.  ARGUMENT \n  A.  The Court Should Grant Plaintiffs’ Motion For Partial Summary Judgment  \n    And Deny Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment With Respect To  \n    Allegheny County. \n \n  1.  Plaintiffs Have Amply Demonstrated A Policy/Practice Of Blanket \n  Strip Searches For All Pre-Trial Detainees Who Were Admitted to the \n  General Population of the ACJ. \n \n  Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that Allegheny County had a \npolicy or custom of blanket strip searches at the ACJ.  This argument strains credulity.  Plaintiffs \nhave amply demonstrated that Allegheny County had a blanket strip search policy for pre-trial \ndetainees who are admitted to the general population.  As detailed in Plaintiffs’ opening brief, \nthe County, in response to a deposition notice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. Rule 30(b)(6), \nproffered Corrections Lieutenant Phil Cestra as its designated deponent. (See Plaintiffs’ Notice \nof Deposition, dated May 8, 2007) (Attached as Ex. C to Keach Aff., Doc. No. 107).  Lieutenant \nCestra is the officer primarily in charge of the “Intake/Booking Area” of the Allegheny County \nJail. (Allegheny County Dep., p. 14) (Attached as Ex. D to Keach Aff., Doc. No. 107). \nLieutenant Cestra admitted that all detainees are subjected to a blanket strip search when \nreceiving the jail uniform in “Phase 6” of the booking process at the Allegheny County Jail, \naccording to the express requirements of Allegheny County’s written policies. (Allegheny \nCounty Dep., pp. 20-22, 111, 155-56, 165-67; Allegheny County Administrative Directive \nNumber 16, “Methods of Searching Inmates,” p. 3 (Keach Aff., Ex. E, Doc. No. 107)).   \n  Five other ACJ Corrections Officers confirmed that blanket strip searches of all pre-trial \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 4 of 13\ndetainees admitted to the ACJ had been the custom and practice of the County through \nDeposition testimony or testimony at the Preliminary Injunction Hearing held before the Court \non March 17, 2008.  See Plaintiffs’ opening brief at 4-5 (Doc. No. 108).   \n  It is well established that “the testimony of the Rule 30(b)(6) designee is deemed to be \nthe testimony of the corporation itself.”  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. New Horizont, Inc., \n250 F.R.D. 203, 212 (E.D. Pa. 2008).  Where a defendant fails to controvert 30(b)(6) testimony \nwith other evidence and a reasonable explanation as to why it was not offered earlier, the \n30(b)(6) testimony controls.  See id.  Here, Defendants have proffered no evidence whatsoever to \ncontradict the evidence of a blanket strip search policy at the ACJ taken from their 30(b)(6) \ndeponent Lieutenant Cestra, the County’s written strip search policies, and the testimony of \nvarious other Corrections Officers at the ACJ.1  Accordingly, there can be no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact concerning the existence of blanket strip search policy at the ACJ, or Allegheny \nCounty’s liability for that policy.  See, e.g., Bartholomew v. Fischl, 782 F.2d 1148, 1153 (3d Cir. \n1986).             \n \n \n  \n                                                 \n1 For this reason, the cases relied upon by Defendants are inapposite.  See Carswell v. Borough of Homestead, 381 \nF.3d 235, 245 (3d Cir. 2004) (finding that the plaintiff failed to establish a lack of training on the use of deadly force \nthat amounted to a deliberate indifference, or demonstrate a pattern of underlying constitutional violations that \nshould have alerted the municipality to an inadequate training program); Gagliardi v. County of Allegheny  2007 \nWL 838971, * 4 (W.D. Pa., 2007) (granting summary judgment for defendants because “No reasonable jury could \nconclude on this record that the Allegheny County Correctional Medical Technician Defendants . . .were \ndeliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's serious medical needs”); Smith v. Municipality of Lycoming County  2006 WL \n1793228, * 3 (M.D. Pa., 2006) (“Smith fails to allege any direct involvement on the part of Lycoming County. Nor \ndoes he allege that Lycoming County undertook any act pursuant to an official municipal policy or custom of some \nnature which caused the alleged Constitutional violation.”); Ludaway v. City of Jacksonville, Fla., 2007 WL \n2455348, * 3 (11th Cir. 2007) (“because a reasonable juror could not find that the use of excessive force among \nofficers in the JSO was so widespread as to have acquired the force of law” plaintiff  failed to show the “alleged use \nof excessive force was the result of the City's policy or custom”).  Here, there is no dispute that the strip searches in \nquestion are conducted pursuant to the County’s written policies.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 5 of 13\n    2.  The Fact That Detainees May Only Be Strip Searched Prior To Their  \n      Entrance Into The General Population Of The ACJ Does Not    \n      Undermine Plaintiffs’ Claim Of A Fourth Amendment Violation. \n \n  Defendants contend that because the class members are not strip searched at their “entry \ninto the jail” but rather only at their admission into the “general population” after a multi-stage \nintake process, no Constitutional violations have occurred.  Defendants’ argument misses the \nmark.  Indeed, the multi-stage intake process is a distinction without any difference.  Despite the \nmulti-stage intake process, the ACJ has a blanket strip search policy - all detainees with the \nminor offenses detailed in the class definition who receive the jail uniform and enter the general \npopulation are strip searched without reasonable suspicion and are perforce class members.  \nDetainees who are bailed out and do not receive prison clothing or enter the general population \nmay not be strip searched and would therefore not be class members.  The crux of the matter is \nthat all class members are strip searched without reasonable suspicion after being charged only \nwith minor offenses; it does not matter exactly at what point in the intake process that the \ndetainee is strip searched.  See, Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56,  (2d Cir. 2001) (post arraignment \nstrip searches).   Defendants raised this same argument in opposition to Plaintiffs motions for \nclass certification in a misguided attempt to show that the class was not properly defined, and the \nCourt rejected it.  The Court should reject it again here.      \n    3.  The Decisions Cited By Defendants Are Unavailing.   \n  Defendants contend that the caselaw permits blanket strip searches of pre-trial detainees \nwithout reasonable suspicion.  To the contrary, as Plaintiffs detail in their opening brief, the near-\nunanimous Federal case authority, some of which was recently decided by District Courts within \nthe Third Circuit, holds that blanket jail strip searches of misdemeanor detainees are \nunconstitutional.  See, for example, Allison v. GEO Group, 611 F. Supp.2d 433 (E.D.Pa. 2009); \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 6 of 13\nNewkirk v. Sheers, 834 F. Supp. 772 (E.D.Pa. 1993).  Further, only yesterday the U.S. Supreme \nCourt again reaffirmed that strip searches may not be performed without reasonable suspicion.  \nSee Safford Unified Sch. Dist. #1 v. Redding,  ___ S.Ct. ___, 2009 WL 1789472 (2009) (Exhibit \nA, hereto).  In Safford the Supreme Court held a school’s strip search of student was a violation \nof the Fourth Amendment because it lacked reasonable suspicion where the school official knew \nthe student only may have possessed over-the-counter pain relievers.  Id.  The Supreme Court \nfound that: \nIn sum, what was missing from the suspected facts that pointed to [plaintiff] was \nany indication of danger to the students from the power of the drugs or their \nquantity, and any reason to suppose that [plaintiff] was carrying pills in her \nunderwear. We think that the combination of these deficiencies was fatal to \nfinding the search reasonable. \n \nId. at * 23.   \n  The Supreme Court further found that to limit a search “to reasonable scope requires the \nsupport of reasonable suspicion of danger or of resort to underwear for hiding evidence of \nwrongdoing before a search can reasonably make the quantum leap from outer clothes and \nbackpacks to exposure of intimate parts.”  Id. at * 24.  Thus, Safford underscores the bedrock \nrequirement for reasonable suspicion to justify such an intrusive search as a strip search.                  \n  Defendants first cite Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc), which \nrecently broke with the other Circuits’ interpretation of Bell.  Defendants’ reliance on Powell is \nmisplaced because Plaintiffs maintain it was wrongly decided and is not persuasive authority.  \nAs an initial matter, Powell does not involve the intrusive visual cavity searches at issue in this \nlitigation.  Powell, 541 F.3d at 1313 & n. 6 (“The strip searches of the five plaintiffs before us \ndid not include body cavity inspections”).  Furthermore, conspicuously absent from Defendants’ \nbriefs is the fact the two District Courts within this Circuit that have thoroughly examined \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 7 of 13\nPowell and have found that it is wrongly decided.  See, Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of \nBurlington, 595 F. Supp. 2d 492, 511 (D.N.J. 2009) (granting summary judgment for plaintiffs \nand finding that “this Court ultimately finds [Powell’s] contrarian holding less than compelling.  \nThe post-contact visit searches upheld in Bell are dissimilar to the post-intake searches struck \ndown by the circuits in the thirty years since that decision. Thus, Powell does not present a \nconvincing argument . . .”); see also, Allison v. GEO Group, 611 F. Supp.2d 433, 457 (E.D. Pa. \n2009) (denying defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings and noting that “this Court \ndisagrees with both the reasoning and holding of the Eleventh Circuit in Powell”).  Accordingly, \nthe Court should follow Florence and Allison and find that Powell does not provide support for \nDefendants’ position.   \n  Defendants next cite to Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955 (6th Cir. 1987), \nto argue that there is no Constitutional violation for strip searching detainees prior to their being \nmoved into the general population of the Allegheny County Jail.  Again, Defendants’ briefs \ncontain a rather conspicuous omission – that the Sixth Circuit later clearly limited the holding of \nDobrowolskyj by finding that “the fact of intermingling alone has never been found to justify \nsuch a search without consideration of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there \nis any reasonable basis for concern that the particular detainee will attempt to introduce weapons \nor other contraband to the institution.” Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1254 (6th Cir. 1989).  \n  Defendants’ reliance upon Richerson v. Lexington Fayette Urban County Gov't, 958 F. \nSupp. 299, 307 (E.D. Ky. 1996) is similarly misplaced.  In Richerson, the pretrial detainees were \nbrought to the courthouse for arraignment where they were exposed to the general public prior to \nbeing returned to the general prison population.  Id.  The Richerson court found that the exposure \nto the general public presented a danger of contraband being passed to a detainee, and therefore a \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 8 of 13\npolicy of strip searching the detainees upon their return from the courthouse and prior to their \nbeing placed back in the general population of the detention center was justified and reasonable.  \nId.  Here, the intake process at the ACJ presents no such opportunity for exposure to the public \nbecause the detainees do not leave the secure facility to travel to a courthouse for arraignment, \nnor do they have exposure to the public in the process.  See Hearing Transcript, Mar. 17, 2008, at \n22-27. (Doc. 107-11).  Rather, arraignment occurs in the same secure facility because a detainee \nonly walks through a hallway to be arraigned.  Id.  Thus, Dobrowolskyj and Richerson provide \nno support for Defendants.         \n  Stanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961, 964 (7th Cir. 2003) is also distinguishable from the case \nat bar.  In Stanley, the defendant employed a clothing exchange procedure where the detainees \nonly needed to undress to their undergarments.  Id.  Here, the strip searches conducted at the ACJ \nnot only required detainees to strip naked, but also included visual examination of genitals, as \nwell as requesting detainees to bend at the waist and/or manipulate the buttocks, breasts and \ngenitals to allow for a visual inspection of their body cavities (including their anus) and skin \nfolds.  See Plaintiffs’ opening brief at 3.  Thus, the clothing exchanges at issue in Stanley \nqualitatively differed from the far more intrusive strip searches at issue here.   \n  Finally Inmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754 (3d Cir. Pa. 1979), and \nOverton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126 cited by Defendants, are factually distinguishable from this \ncase because neither involve blanket strip searches of pretrial detainees.  Rather, Inmates of \nAllegheny County Jail involved the propriety of strip searches for inmates after contact visits – a \nprocedure that is not at issue in this case, 612 F.2d at 758, and Overton only dealt with \nrestrictions on noncontact visits for inmates, and did not even mention strip searches.  539 U.S.  \nat 131. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 9 of 13\n  In sum, the cases cited by Defendants are unavailing, especially when compared to the \nnear-unanimous authority to the contrary, and the recent Supreme Court decision in Safford that \nreaffirmed the requirement of reasonable suspicion for the performance of strip searches.   \n \n    4.  The Representative Plaintiffs Are Entitled To  \n      Summary Judgment On Liability. \n \n  Defendants assert that Harry Delandro and Karen Murphy are not entitled to summary \njudgment on liability.  The first basis for this argument is that Defendants had reasonable \nsuspicion to search Harry Delandro because he was on crutches and wearing a leg immobilizer, \nabsurdly characterized by defendants as “steel bars,” at the time of his arrest due to recent \nsurgery.  See Hearing Transcript, Mar. 17, 2008, pp. 15-19. (Doc. 107-11).  Indeed, just to state \nthe argument that a plainly incapacitated man posed a security risk because of the walking aids \nhe wore is to show its ridiculousness.  Further, Defendants’ own admissions are they never did a \nbackground check or considered, at the time they strip searched him, whether they had \nreasonable suspicion.  Because a defendant may not invent a post hoc justification for an \nunconstitutional strip search, Defendants’ argument fails.  See, Bizzarro v. Ocean County, 2009 \nWL 1617887, * 13 (D.N.J. June 9, 2009) (“Defendants cannot create post-hoc rationales to \nmanufacture justifications for conducting strip searches”); Doe v. Calumet City, 754 F. Supp. \n1211, 1220 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (defendant cannot avoid liability by manufacturing post-hoc basis for \nstrip searches which were conducted pursuant to indiscriminate and routine policy).                   \n  Defendants next argue that Karen Murphy was never in the Allegheny County Jail.  In \nlight of the prior proof put before the Court, this argument is patently (and knowingly) false, and \nridiculous.  Karen Murphy testified in open Court that she was in the ACJ and strip searched in \nAugust 2005.  See id., p. 20.  In addition to Ms. Murphy’s testimony, the ACJ Booking Sheets \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 10 of 13\nfurther evidence that she was admitted to the ACJ during in August 2005.  See Allegheny County \nJail Charge Sheet, attached hereto as Exh. B (indicating that Ms. Murphy’s was admitted into the \nACJ in August 2005).  Thus, there can be no genuine issue of material fact concerning Ms. \nMurphy’s presence and strip search at the ACJ.        \n  Defendants made these very same arguments in opposition to class certification and the \nCourt rejected them.  The Court should reject them again here.        \n \n  B.  Plaintiffs Seek Permission From The Court To Dismiss The  \n    Individual Defendants.    \n \nOn August 8, 2008, this Court certified the above action against the County of Allegheny, \nRamon C. Rustin in his individual capacity as warden of Allegheny County Jail, Edward Urban \nindividually and in his official capacity as deputy warden of Allegheny County Jail, Gregory \nGrogan individually and in his official capacity as deputy warden of Allegheny County Jail, \nLance Bohn individually and in his official capacity as deputy warden of Allegheny County Jail \nand William Emerick individually and in his official capacity as assistant deputy warden of \nAllegheny County Jail based on their unlawful strip searches of plaintiffs and members of the \nclass.  (Doc. No. 99).  On May 26, 2009, Defendants moved for partial summary judgment of the \nabove individual Defendants on the grounds of qualified immunity.  Plaintiffs seek permission \nfrom this Court to dismiss the individual Defendants Ramon Rustin, Edward Urban, Gregory \nGrogan, Lance Bohn and William Emerick.  Plaintiffs will continue to pursue their claims \nagainst the County. \nPursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff may not \nvoluntarily dismiss or compromise any claim or party involved in a certified class without the \napproval of court.  Rule 23(e) states: \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 11 of 13\nThe claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class may be settled, \nvoluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court’s \napproval.  The following procedures apply to a proposed \nsettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise: \n(1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to \nall class member who would be bound by the proposal. \n(2) If the proposal would bind class members , the court \nmay approve it only after a hearing and on finding that it is \nfair, reasonable and adequate. \n(3) The parties seeking approval must file statement \nidentifying any agreement made in connection with the \nproposal. \n(4) If the class action was previously certified under Rule \n23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a settlement \nunless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to \nindividual class member who had an earlier opportunity to \nrequest exclusion but did not do so. \n(5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it \nrequires court approval under this subdivision (e); the \nobjection may be withdrawn only with the court’s approval. \n \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(e). \n \nPlaintiffs now seek to dismiss the individual Defendants, Ramon Rustin, Edward Urban, \nGregory Grogan, Lance Bohn and William Emerick.  Plaintiffs are not seeking any additional \ndamages from these individual Defendants besides those that the plaintiffs can recover from the \nCounty of Allegheny.  Thus, absent class members will not be unfairly prejudiced.  Further, \nPlaintiffs intend to file a motion for this Court to provide Court approved notice to the class \nidentifying the certification of this class and the parties.  Thus, absent class members will be \nfully apprised of the action and parties.  Finally, Class Counsel believes that it is in the class’ \nbest interest to bring this matter to trial immediately rather than await a likely interlocutory \nappeal to the Third Circuit, which would stay this litigation.  Delay of this matter by pursuing \nindividual defendants will not ultimately benefit the class. Thus, Plaintiffs join in Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss the individual defendants Ramon Rustin, Edward Urban, Gregory Grogan, \nLance Bohn and William Emerick. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00927-TFM   Document 116    Filed 06/26/09   Page 12 of 13\n \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  For these reasons, and for reasons previously stated, the Plaintiffs’ motion for partial \nsummary judgment on liability should be granted and Defendant’s motion for summary \njudgment should be denied, with the exception of the dismissal of the individual defendants.   \nRespectfully submitted:   \n \n            /s  lmer Eobert R each K\n \nDate:   June 26, 2009       _________________________________ \nElmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire \nMember of the Bar, U.S.D.C., W.D.Pa. \nLAW OFFICES OF ELMER ROBERT \n         KEACH, III, PC \n1040 Riverfront Center \nPost Office Box 70 \nAmsterdam, NY  12010 \n518.434.1718 \nAaron Rihn, Esquire \nRobert Peirce & Associates, P.C. \n2500 Gulf Tower \n707 Grant Street \nPittsburgh, PA 15219-1918 \n412.281.7229 \nPA ID. 85752 \n \nDaniel Levin, Esquire \nLevin Fishbein Sedran & Berman \n250 Walnut Street \nSuite 500 \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania \n215.592.1500 \n \nGary E.
