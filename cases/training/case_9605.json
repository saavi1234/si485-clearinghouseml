Officers at the Miami Pre-Trial Detention Center strip searched the women protestors, conducting a visual body-cavity search.  </p><p>When Judith Haney, one of the protestors who had been searched got home to California, she got in touch with Mark Merin, the lawyer who representing plaintiffs challenging similar conduct in San Francisco and Sacramento.  Merin brought in the Florida Justice Institute, an organization well known for its work on behalf of prison and jail inmates.  They filed the case in March 2004 in the Southern District of Florida as a (putative) class action.</p><p>The city disagreed on the facts, and also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek injunctive relief (since none of them lived in Miami and was likely to be arrested again).  The case was assigned to Adalberto Jordan, a Clinton appointee to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  In August 2004, Judge Jordan denied the city's motion to dismiss the injunctive claims.  Haney v. Miami-Dade County, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19552 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 24, 2004).</p><p>The parties reached agreement in February 2005, setting the class as women improperly strip searched from March 5, 2000 until February 28, 2005.  The jail implemented a new policy, which allowed strip searches prior to formal first appearance before a judge and subsequent incarceration in general population only if the charged offense involved violence, weapons, or drugs, or if there was some other individualized suspicion relating to contraband.   (The new policy was entered in court in a stipulation as part of the settlement papers.)</p><p>The monetary settlement was $6.25 million--$4,550,000 for verified claims by class members; $1 million for attorneys' fees; $100,000 for plaintiffs' costs and expenses; $300,000 for the five class representatives; and $300,000 for settlement administration.   About 1000 women submitted claims, and split the $4.55 million with each person's share based on the number of times she was strip searched and other aggravating circumstances.</p><p></p>",

Females, non-felony arrestees in Miami-Dade County are routinely subjected to\ndehumanizing invasive strip and visual body cavity searches upon arrival at the Miami-Dade\nCounty Pre-Trial Detention Center and the Miami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center, prior\nto First Appearance, despite such blanket strip searches violating state and federal law.\n2.  The blanket strip searches are particularly reprehensible as they appear, upon\ninformation and belief, to be reserved only for females.\n3.  Unless enjoined and restricted, upon information and belief, Defendants will maintain\ntheir policy and practice of illegally subjecting pre-first appearance, non-felony, female arrestees\ncharged with non-violent, non-drug and non-weapons related offenses to illegal strip and visual\nbody cavity searches.\nJURISDICTION\n4.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1988, and the Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1331 and § 1343(a)(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.\nPARTIES\n5.  Plaintiffs, including JUDITH HANEY, LIAT MAYER, JAMIE LOUGHNER,\nDARCY SMITH, AMANDA WELLS, and all those similarly situated, are, and at all material\ntimes herein, were arrested and subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches at the Miami-\nDade County Pre-Trial Detention Center and the Miami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center.\n6.  Defendant MIAMI-DADE COUNTY is, and at all material times referred to herein,\nwas, a political division of the state of Florida, that maintained or permitted an official policy or\n- 2 -\n2 of 20\n\ncustom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of\nherein, which wrongs damaged Plaintiffs as herein alleged.\n7.  Defendant MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, through the Miami-Dade County Corrections and\nRehabilitation Department, manages and operates the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention\nCenter and the Miami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center, where the wrongs complained\nof herein occurred.\n8.  Defendant CHARLES J. MCRAY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was\nthe Acting Director of the Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation Department,\nresponsible for administering the jail facilities in which the wrongs complained of herein occurred,\nand for making, overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged\nherein relating to the operation of the County’s jail facilities.  He is sued in his individual and\nofficial capacities. \n9.  Defendant ACTING CAPTAIN M. ALADRO is the Facility Supervisor at the Miami-\nDade County Pre-Trial Detention Center, responsible for making, overseeing, and implementing\nthe policies, practices and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the Pre-Trial\nDetention Center.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.\n10.  Defendant CAPTAIN M. FULLER is the Facility Supervisor at the Miami-Dade\nCounty Women’s Detention Center, responsible for making, overseeing, and implementing the\npolicies, practices and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the Pre-Trial\nDetention Center. She is sued in her individual and official capacities.\n11.  Defendants MIAMI-DADE COUNTY CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION\nDEPARTMENT OFFICERS JANE DOEs 1 through DOE 150, sued herein by their fictitious\n- 3 -\n3 of 20\n\nnames, are all Correctional Officers who, as part of their duties at the Pretrial Detention Center,\nsubjected Plaintiffs to pre-first appearance strip and visual body cavity searches without first\nhaving, and recording in writing, a particularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be\nproductive of contraband or weapons.  They are sued in their individual capacity.\n12.  At all material times mentioned herein, each of the Defendants was acting under the\ncolor of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages\nof the state of Florida, the COUNTY OF MIAMI-DADE, and/or the Miami-Dade County\nCorrections and Rehabilitation Department. \nCLASS CLAIMS\n13.  The named Plaintiffs bring this suit as a class action, pursuant to the provisions of\nRule 23(b)(2) & (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for injunctive and declaratory relief,\nand for monetary damages, on behalf of a class of all persons similarly situated.\n14.  The class of Plaintiffs consists of all women arrested on non-felony charges who,\nwithin the applicable four year statute of limitations, and continuing to this date, were subjected\nby Defendants to pre-first appearance strip and/or visual body cavity searches at the Miami-Dade\nCounty Pre-Trial Detention Center, the Miami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center, or any\nother jail facility operated by Defendant Miami-Dade County, without Defendants having, and\nrecording in writing, a particularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive\nof contraband or weapons.\n15.  The Plaintiff class consists of an unknown but large number of individuals, numbering\nin the thousands, so that joinder of all members is impracticable.\n16.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants have the\n- 4 -\n4 of 20\n\nability to identify all such similarly situated Plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in Defendants’\ncustody at any time during the applicable statute of limitations, were subjected to strip and/or\nvisual body cavity searches prior to first appearance without Defendants first having, and\nrecording, a particularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of\ncontraband or weapons.\n17.  There are questions of fact common to the class including, but not limited to: (1)\nwhere Defendants routinely subject all females arrested to strip and/or visual body cavity searches\nprior to first appearance if they intend such persons to be housed at the Women’s Detention Center\nand the Pretrial Detention Center; (2) whether only females – not males – are subjected to the strip\nand/or visual body cavity search; (3) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body\ncavity searches prior to first appearance without their being any particularized reasonable\nsuspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed\ndrugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a strip\nand/or visual body cavity search; and (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are\nconducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not\nparticipating in the searches, or whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are conducted\nin areas where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches.\n18.  There are questions of law common to the class, including, but not limited to: (1)\nwhether Defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity searches on persons prior to their\nfirst appearance without particularized reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts,\nto believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband, which would\nlikely be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether Defendants may perform strip\n- 5 -\n5 of 20\n\nand/or visual body cavity searches on females when they do not subject males to similar searches;\n(3)  whether strip and/or visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the search\ncan be observed by people not participating in the search without violating Plaintiff’s federal\nconstitutional rights; and (4) whether or not Defendants’ strip and visual body cavity search policy\nand procedure is in accordance with the federal constitution.\n19.  The claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were\nsearched, prior to first appearance, without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity\nsearch would produce drugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such\nsuspicion being articulated in a supervisor approved document).  Representative Plaintiffs have\nthe same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the other class members.\nPlaintiffs’ claims arose because of Defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees\nto strip and visual body cavity searches before first appearance without having, and recording in\nwriting, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.\nPlaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each\nclass member suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity search.\nThe actual damages suffered by representative Plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the\nactual damages suffered by each class member.\n20.  The representative Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interest.\nPlaintiffs’ interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. They have\na strong personal interest in the outcome of this action and have no conflicts of interest with\nmembers of the Plaintiff class. The named Plaintiffs were all subjected to strip and visual body\ncavity searches without legal justification.  As long as the policies, practices and customs of the\n- 6 -\n6 of 20\n\nDefendants continue to permit dehumanizing invasive strip and visual body cavity searches, the\nnamed Plaintiffs, and the class they represent, are and will remain at high risk of being subjected\nto searches in clear violation of established constitutional rights.\n21.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel who specialize in civil\nrights litigation.\n22.  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create\na risk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class\nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class. \n23.  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create\na risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would,\nas a practical matter, substantially impair or impede the ability of the other members of the class\nto protect their interests.\n24.  The Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby\nmaking appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\n25.  A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and equitable\nadjudication of the controversy between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\nthereupon allege, that the interests of members of the class in individually controlling the\nprosecution of a separate action is low in that most class members would be unable individually\nto prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most\nmembers of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed\nand believe, and thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum\nbecause all of the claims arise in the same location.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve\n- 7 -\n7 of 20\n\nthe common questions of law and fact in one form, rather than in multiple courts.\n26.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated are subjected are violations of clearly established constitutional rights that are over before\nthey can be challenged in court because all Plaintiffs are released prior to or at first appearance\n(normally within the first 48 hours of incarceration).\n27. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated are subjected are violations of clearly established constitutional rights for which no\nchallenge is possible prior to the violation occurring because the time period between arrest and\nsearch is so short and because no Plaintiff has the opportunity between arrest and search to retain\ncounsel or seek judicial review. \n28. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated are subjected are violations of clearly established constitutional rights which occur as the\nresult on the established and on-going policy, practice and custom of the Defendants and for which\nmonetary damages after-the-fact is not suitable long-term relief.\n29.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated are subjected have continued since the date this lawsuit was originally filed, on March 5,\n2004, and in all likelihood will continue, absent class certification and injunctive relief as\nrequested in this Complaint.\n30.  Absent class injunctive relief, there is no reason to believe that Defendants’ violation\nof clearly established constitutional rights will not continue and that Plaintiff class members, as\nthe class is defined in this complaint, will most certainly be subjected to a constitutionally infirm\nstrip and visual body cavity search. \n- 8 -\n8 of 20\n\n31.  Because of the time and setting in which the Defendants violate clearly established\nconstitutional rights, injunctive relief on behalf of the class is appropriate because the illegal\npolicy, practice and custom of the Defendants is capable of repetition but evading judicial review\nif declaratory and injunctive relief is not provided.\nFACTS\nA.  JUDITH HANEY\n32.  Plaintiff, JUDITH HANEY is, and at all times material hereto was, a resident of the\ncity of Oakland, California.\n33.  On or about November 21, 2003, Plaintiff JUDITH HANEY was sitting on the\nsidewalk across from the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention Center (hereinafter referred to\nas the “Detention Center”), along with three other women and three men, when they were arrested\nallegedly for “failing to disburse” and taken across the street to the Detention Center to be booked.\nPlaintiff HANEY and the other women arrested were separated from the males and, one at a time,\ntaken to a separate area where each woman was made fully to disrobe, placing each of her items\nof clothing on a table, then to bend over, exposing her anus and vaginal area for inspection by\nDefendants and then made to squat and to “hop like a bunny” three times before being permitted\nto put her own clothes back on.\n34.  When Plaintiff HANEY was naked, Defendant JANE DOE 1 noticed a naval piercing\nand ordered Plaintiff HANEY to remove it.  When Plaintiff HANEY was unable to remove the\nnavel ring, JANE DOE 1 obtained a wire cutter and clipped it off.  During the entire time Plaintiff\nHANEY was standing naked in an area with the door open and with people passing by who could\nfreely observe her.\n- 9 -\n9 of 20\n\n35.  Over the next several hours, Plaintiff HANEY and others were transported in paddy\nwagons to various locations finally arriving at the Turner-Gilford-Knight Miami Detention Center\n(hereinafter referred to as “TGK”) where she was again processed and held in various holding\ntanks until she was released after approximately 35 hours.\n36.  On or about February 5, 2004, all charges against Plaintiff HANEY and others\narrested with her were dismissed.\n37.  Plaintiff HANEY is a 50 year old management employee of Genetech Corporation.\nShe was humiliated and embarrassed by being subjected to the aforementioned visual body cavity\nsearch and by being required to stand, naked, for any passerby to observe.  She suffered mental\nand emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving her of\nrights secured to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nB.  LIAT MAYER\n38.  Plaintiff LIAT MAYER is, and at all times material hereto, was a resident of\nBrooklyn, New York.\n39.  On or about November 21, 2003, Plaintiff MAYER was seated on the sidewalk across\nfrom Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention Center with three other women, including JUDITH\nHANEY, and three men, when they were arrested allegedly for “failing to disburse” and taken\nacross the street to the Detention Center to be booked. \n40.  Plaintiff MAYER and the other women with whom she was arrested were separated\nfrom the males and, one at a time, taken to a separate area where each women was made fully to\ndisrobe, placing each of her items of clothing on the table, then to bend over, exposing her anus\nand vaginal area for inspection by Defendants and then made to squat and to “hop like a bunny”\n- 10 -\n10 of 20\n\nthree times before being permitted to put her own clothes back on.\n41.  While Plaintiff MAYER was naked, Defendant JANE DOE 2, left the door to the area\nwhere the search was being conducted open so that Plaintiff MAYER could be and was observed\nnaked as people passed by and freely observed her. \n42.  Over the next several hours, Plaintiff MAYER and others were transported in paddy\nwagons to various locations around Miami and finally delivered to TGK where she was again\nprocessed and held in various holding tanks until being released approximately 35 hours later.\n43.  On or about February 5, 2004, all charges against Plaintiff MAYER were dismissed.\n44.  Plaintiff MAYER is a student who was humiliated, embarrassed and suffered mental\nand emotional distress as a result of being subjected to the aforementioned visual body cavity\nsearch and by being required to stand, naked, for any passerby to observe.  She suffered these and\nother damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving her of rights\nsecured to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nC.  JAMIE LOUGHNER\n45.  Plaintiff JAMIE LOUGHNER is thirty-nine (39) years of age, and at all times material\nhereto was, a resident of Arlington, Virginia.\n46.  On or about November 20, 2003, Plaintiff LOUGHNER was arrested and later\ncharged with two misdemeanors, resisting arrest without violence and failure to obey a lawful\norder.  Plaintiff LOUGHNER was then taken to TGK where she was given a pat down search.\n47.  Two days later, on Saturday, November 22, 2003, Plaintiff LOUGHNER was\ntransported from TGK to the Miami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center, along with seven\n(7) other women.\n- 11 -\n11 of 20\n\n48.  Upon arrival at the Women’s Detention Center, Plaintiff LOUGHNER was placed in one\nof the cubicles found near the entrance area.  Plaintiff LOUGHNER was told to fully disrobe and\nplaced her clothes on a seat.  She was then told while fully nude to bend over, exposing her anus and\nvaginal area for inspection by Defendant JANE DOE 3 and then told to squat, cough and then to\nbend over and spread her buttocks and vagina (hereinafter “privates”) for a visual inspection.  She\nwas then told to cough again while bent over with her privates pointed at Defendant JANE DOE 4,\nand to “open up [privates] wider” and to “shake it.”\n49.  This strip and body cavity search procedure occurred with two guards present, Defendant\nJANE DOE 3 who gave Plaintiff LOUGHNER instructions and inspected her privates, and\nDefendant JANE DOE 4 who witnessed the strip search procedure.  Plaintiff LOUGHNER was then\nallowed to put her own clothes back on. \n50.  Plaintiff LOUGHNER could see one of the other women detainees in the cubicle\nopposite her during the entire strip search procedure.\n51.  Plaintiff LOUGHNER was released from Jail November 25, 2003.  Her criminal charges\nwere later dropped and have not been refiled. \n52.  The strip search and body cavity exam Plaintiff LOUGHNER experienced was\nhumiliating and embarrassing, and left her mortified.\n53.  Plaintiff LOUGHNER has suffered mental and emotional distress as a direct and\nproximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving her of rights secured to her by the Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nD.  DARCY SMITH\n54.  Plaintiff DARCY SMITH is twenty-nine (29), and at all times material hereto, was a\n- 12 -\n12 of 20\n\nresident of Aventura, Florida.\n55.  On or about March 17, 2004, at approximately 12:30 a.m., Plaintiff SMITH was arrested\nby the City of Aventura Police for misdemeanor battery after allegedly getting into an altercation\nwith her roommate. \n56.  Plaintiff SMITH was taken from her home by the City of Aventura Police Department\nto a holding cell at the City of Aventura Police Department.  About 3 a.m. on or about March 17,\n2004 she was transported to the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention Center where she was\nbooked and finger-printed.  At around 1:00 p.m. on or about March 17, 2004, she was taken to the\nMiami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center and taken to a holding cell.  Shortly thereafter\nPlaintiff SMITH was instructed to remove her bra and flip-flops.

AMANDA WELLS\n60.  Plaintiff AMANDA WELLS is forty-two (42) years of age, and at all times material\nhereto was, a resident of Miami Beach, Florida.\n61.  On Friday, April 23, 2004, Plaintiff WELLS was arrested around 5 p.m. for an\noutstanding bench warrant for failure to appear on an earlier misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest\nwithout violence.  Plaintiff WELLS was then taken to TGK where she was pat searched and held on\na bus for 4 to 5 hours.  She was then transported at around 10 p.m. to the Miami-Dade County Pre-\nTrial Detention Center along with three (3 ) other women and about ten (10) men to wait for first\nappearance.\n62.  Plaintiff WELLS and the other women transported with her were separated from the\nmales and, one at a time, taken to a separate area where each woman was made fully to disrobe,\nplacing each of her items of clothing on a table, then to bend over, exposing her anus and vaginal\narea for inspection by Defendants and then made to squat and to “hop like a bunny” three times\nbefore being permitted to put her clothes back on.  There was never any privacy and anyone walking\nby could view her in the nude as the strip search procedure was performed.\n63.  This strip and body cavity search procedure at the Detention Center occurred with\nDefendant JANE DOE 6 present who gave Plaintiff WELLS instructions and inspected her privates.\nPlaintiff WELLS was then allowed to put her own clothes back on. \n- 14 -\n14 of 20\n\n64.  Plaintiff WELLS could see one of the other women detainees in the cubicle opposite her\nduring the entire strip search procedure.\n65.  Plaintiff WELLS was released from Detention Center at 10 a.m. on Saturday, April 24,\n2004.\n66.  The strip search and body cavity exam Plaintiff WELLS experienced was humiliating\nand embarrassing, and left her mortified.\n67.  Plaintiff WELLS has suffered mental and emotional distress as a direct and proximate\nresult of Defendants’ actions in depriving her of rights secured to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.\nCOUNT ONE\n(Violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \non Behalf of Plaintiffs and All Persons Similarly Situated)\n68.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs one (1) through sixty-seven (67) as though fully\nset forth herein.\n69.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of named\nDefendants and the individual correctional officers sued herein by the fictitious names JANE DOEs\n1 through 150.\n70.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the\nalleged offenses for which Plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs\nwere eligible for release at First Appearance, and without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs were\neligible for and/or were released on their own recognizance.\n- 15 -\n15 of 20\n\n71.  The searches complained of herein were performed without Defendants having a\nreasonable belief that the Plaintiffs so searched possessed weapons or contraband or that there\nexisted facts supporting a particularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would produce\ncontraband.\n72.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants routinely\nfollow a policy, practice, and custom of requiring pre-first appearance female detainees, including\nthose processed at the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention Center and the Miami-Dade County\nWomen’s Detention Center, to strip naked and to submit to visual body cavity searches without\nhaving, and recording in writing, a particularized reasonable suspicion that the searches will be\nproductive of contraband or weapons. \n73.  In searching the Plaintiffs as alleged, Defendant DOEs acted in accordance with the\npolicy, practice and customs of Defendants MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, MCRAY, ALADRO and\nFULLER. \n74.  Strip and body cavity searches, as alleged in this Complaint, are done as a matter of\nroutine, and are authorized, permitted and encouraged, in accordance with the established policies,\npractices and customs of Defendant MIAMI-DADE COUNTY.\n75.  Defendants MCRAY, ALADRO and FULLER authorize, permit, facilitate, encourage,\nand acquiesce in the behavior of their subordinates, who routinely conduct strip and visual body\ncavity searches of females, as alleged in this Complaint.\n76.  Individual named Defendants herein are personally responsible for the promulgation and\ncontinuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which Plaintiffs herein and\nall those similarly situated, were subjected to the searches complained of herein.\n- 16 -\n16 of 20\n\n77.  Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body cavity\nsearches complained of herein violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.\nConstitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and violated said Plaintiffs’ rights\nto due process and privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, and directly and proximately damaged\nPlaintiffs as herein alleged, entitling Plaintiffs to recover damages for said constitutional violation\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n78.  As a result of being subjected to the strip and visual body cavity searches complained\nof herein, each of the Plaintiffs suffered physical, mental and emotional distress, invasion of privacy,\nand the violation of due process of law and federal constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover\ndamages according to proof.\nCOUNT TWO\n(Violation of Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\non Behalf of Plaintiffs and All Persons Similarly Situated)\n79.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs one (1) through seventy-eight (78) as though\nfully set forth herein.\n80.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and on that basis allege that Defendants, pursuant to\npolicy and procedure, discriminate against women by selecting female pretrial arrestees for strip and\nvisual body cavity searches but do not subject males arrested for similar crimes to these humiliating\nand invasive unconstitutional strip searches.\n81.  By selecting females for strip and visual body cavity searches only, Defendants\ndiscriminate against Plaintiffs on the basis of their sex and deny to them the equal protection of the\nlaws guaranteed to them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n- 17 -\n17 of 20\n\n82.  Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding subjecting female pretrial\narrestees to strip and visual body cavity searches while not requiring male pretrial arrestees to\nundergo the same or similar procedure violates Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment right to the equal\nprotection of the laws and directly and proximately damaged Plaintiffs as herein alleged, entitling\nPlaintiffs to recover damages for said constitutional violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in\naddition to other damages.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nA.  For declaratory and injunctive relief declaring illegal and enjoining, preliminarily and\npermanently, Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs of subjecting female, non-felony, pre-first\nappearance detainees to strip and visual body cavity searches without having and recording in writing\na reasonable suspicion that such searches would be productive of contraband or weapons;\nB.  For declaratory and injunctive relief declaring illegal and enjoining, preliminarily and\npermanently, the policy of selectively subjecting female, non-felony, pre-first appearance detainees\nto strip and visual body cavity searches while not so subjecting male pre-first appearance detainees\nto such searches;\nC.    Certification  of  this  action  as  a  class  action,  designation  of  Plaintiffs  as  class\nrepresentatives and counsel as class counsel;\nD.  For compensatory, general, and special damages for each representative and for each\nmember of the class of Plaintiffs, as against all Defendants;\nE.  Exemplary damages as against all of the individual Defendants in an amount sufficient\nto deter and to make an example of those Defendants;\nF.  Attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and\n- 18 -\n18 of 20\n\nG. The cost of this suit and such other relief as the court finds just and proper.\nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED\nPlaintiffs demand trial by jury as to all issues triable as a right before a jury.\nRespectfully submitted,\nMark E.

If you submit a claim form, you will be bound by the\nsettlement and receive money (if you are a class member).  If you do not submit a claim form but do not exclude yourself from the\nclass (as explained in the next paragraph), you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and dismissal entered in this case, but you\nwill not receive any money.\nBy participating in this Settlement you will be waiving all your rights to all claims up to and including February 28, 2005, related to\nstrip searches at the Miami-Dade Pre-Trial Detention Centers, even those of which you are not presently aware.  \n2. Exclude Yourself From the Class\nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called “excluding” yourself. If you exclude\nyourself, you can not get a payment and you can not object to the Settlement. Any Court orders will not apply to you.  To\nexclude yourself, you must sign a request for exclusion letter that states that you want to be excluded from Haney, et al. v.\nMiami-Dade County, et. al., United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Case No. 04-20516-\nCIV Jordan/Brown.

Strip\nSearch Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, Settlement Services, Inc., 2032-D Thomasville Road, Tallahassee,\nFlorida 32308.\nIf you do not follow these instructions properly, you will lose your right to exclude yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you cannot get\nany money from the Settlement of this case and you cannot tell the Court you do not like the Settlement (which is called “objecting”).\nIf you exclude yourself, you are no longer part of the class or the Settlement. But you can sue or be part of a different lawsuit about the\nclaims in this case.\nE. Fairness Hearing and Process for Objections.\nA fairness hearing will be held on September 22, 2005, at 9:00 a.m., at the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida,\nMiami Division, 301 N. Miami Avenue, Courtroom 8, Miami, Florida.  If you are a class member and do not exclude yourself, you can\ntell the Court you do not like the Settlement or some part of it at this hearing. This is called objecting to the Settlement. For example,\nyou can say you do not think the Settlement is fair or adequate.  The Court will consider your views. \nTo object, you must send a letter to the court that contains all of the following: \n1. The name and title of the lawsuit, Haney, et al. v. Miami-Dade County, et al., United States District Court, Southern\nDistrict of Florida, Miami Division, Case No. 04-20516 CIV Jordan/Brown;\n2.

A statement on whether or not you or your lawyer will ask to appear at the Fairness Hearing to talk about your\nobjections, and, if so, how long you will need to present your objections; and \n5. Copies of any documents you or your lawyer will present at the Fairness Hearing.\nAt the hearing on the proposed settlement, the Court may schedule further hearings without further notice to the class.  The matters\nconsidered at such future hearings may include, but shall not be limited to, further consideration of the fairness and adequacy of the\nproposed settlement, the determination of the settlement of individual claims filed by class members, consideration of the request for\nattorneys’ fees and reimbursement of costs and expenses to class counsel, and the form and entry of the final judgment of dismissal in\nthe event the proposed settlement is approved by the court.\nIndividually, or through counsel, any class member has the right to object to the proposed Settlement as a whole, to the amount of\nattorneys’ fees and costs of Class Counsel, or to any portion of either.  ANY SUCH OBJECTIONS MUST BE FILED IN WRITING\nON OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER 1, 2005, IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,\nMIAMI DIVISION, 301 N. MIAMI AVENUE, COURTROOM 8, MIAMI, FLORIDA, ATTENTION: CLERK, RE: HANEY, ET\nAL. V. MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, ET AL., CASE NO. 04-20516-CIV JORDAN/BROWN.

STATEMENT OF FACTS/HISTORY OF LITIGATION\nA. Facts\nPlaintiffs filed their Class Action Complaint alleging they were unconstitutionally strip\nsearched following arrest for minor offenses and prior to their first appearances.  Plaintiffs\nalleged that defendants typically booked females at the Miami-Dade Pre-Trial Detention Center\nand transported those not cited or bailed out to the Women’s Detention Center to be held\novernight and returned to the Pre-Trial Detention Center for their first appearances.  Plaintiffs\nfurther alleged that defendants’ practice and de facto policy was to strip search all women upon\narrival at the Women’s Detention Center to be held pending first appearance regardless of the\ncharges on which they were arrested and regardless of whether or not they had been previously\nstrip searched at the Pre-Trial Detention Center.  No records of the strip searches at the Women’s\nDetention Center were maintained.  Despite the requirement of Florida Statute 901.211 that no\nperson arrested on a minor offense be strip searched prior to first appearance without the specific\nwritten authorization of a supervising officer, no such required prior authorizations were\nobtained.  \n- 2 -\n2 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 3 of 45 \nFemales arrested on charges relating to prostitution, whether or not they were cited or\nbailed out prior to first appearance, were routinely strip searched at the Pre-Trial Detention\nCenter pursuant to defendants’ written policy.  \nMales arrested and booked at the Pre-Trial Detention Center were subjected to routine\nstrip searches only if the charges on which they were arrested involved violence, drugs or\nweapons.  \nAfter conducting discovery on plaintiffs’ allegations, the parties opened negotiations for a\ncomprehensive resolution of this litigation, including compensation to persons who may have\nbeen strip searched illegally, and revisions of jail strip search practices.  \nThe Stipulation of Settlement, attached hereto as Exhibit 2, the result of those\nnegotiations, defines a “Settlement Class”, provides methods to notify members of the class of\nthe terms of the proposed settlement, and entitlement to receive compensation under the\nsettlement, to object to the settlement at a Fairness Hearing before this Court, or to opt out of the\nsettlement.  \nIII.  SUMMARY OF APPLICABLE LAW\nA. Federal Law\nIn 1979, the United States Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861,\n60 L.Ed.2d 449 (1979) held that custodial strip searches are subject to a balancing test which\nweighs the privacy interest of the person to be searched against the legitimate security interests of\nthe institution.   Following Bell v. Wolfish, courts considering the issue have applied objective\nstandards to determine the reasonableness of strip searches of pre-trial detainees.  In Skurstenis v.\nJones, 236 F.3d 678, 682 (11th Cir. 2000), for instance, the court held that a blanket strip search\npolicy violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it did not\n- 3 -\n3 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 4 of 45 \nrequire reasonable suspicion as a predicate to strip searching newly admitted detainees.\nIn Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir. 2001) the court held that the strip search of\nplaintiff Wilson who was arrested for driving under the influence and strip searched pursuant to a\npolicy which required a “complete search” prior to admission into the general population violated\nthe Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Likewise, the\npolicy which authorized the search, without reasonable suspicion, violated the Fourth\nAmendment.  In so holding, the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged that a host of other Circuits\n“addressing this issue have held similar policies unconstitutional.”  See, e.g., Roberts v. Rhode\nIsland, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir. 2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393 (10th Cir. 1993); Fuller v.\nM.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir. 1991); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989);\nWatt v. City of Richardson Police Department, 849 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1988); Webber v. Dell, 804\nF.2d 796 (2nd Cir. 1986); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985); Mary Beth G. v. City of\nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983).\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that states shall not deny “any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, ¶ 1.  Where States make\ngender-based classifications, there is a “real danger that government policies that professedly are\nbased on reasonable considerations in fact may be reflective of ‘archaic and over broad’\ngeneralizations about gender or based on ‘outdated misconceptions  concerning the role of\nfemales in the home rather than in the marketplace and world of ideas’.”  J.E.B. v. Ala. ex rel.\nT.B., 511 U.S. 127, 135 (1994).  \nThe strip search of females charged with minor offenses not involving violence, drugs or\nweapons who were held prior to first appearance, while males in similar situation are not strip\nsearched, violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Ford v. Suffolk\n- 4 -\n4 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 5 of 45 \nCounty, 154 F.Supp.2d 131, 151 (D. Mass. 2001); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d\n1263 (7th Cir. 1983).  \nB. Florida State Law\nSection 901.211, Florida Statutes, defines “strip search” as “having an arrested person\nremove or arrange some or all of his or her clothing so as to permit a visual or manual inspection\nof the genitals; buttocks; anus; breasts, in the case of a female; or undergarments of such person.” \n The statute prohibits the strip search of any person arrested for “a traffic, regulatory, or\nmisdemeanor offense, except in a case which is violent in nature, which involves a weapon, or\nwhich involves a controlled substance” unless “there is probable cause to believe that the\nindividual is concealing a weapon, a controlled substance, or stolen property” or “a judge at first\nappearance has found that the person arrested cannot be released either on recognizance or bond\nand thereafter shall be incarcerated in the county jail.”  Importantly, “no law enforcement officer\nshall order a strip search within the agency or facility without the written authorization of the\nsupervising officer on duty.” \nFlorida courts have held that the appropriate remedy for a strip search in violation of Fla.\nStat. § 901.211 is the suppression of evidence obtained by the unlawful search and, possibly,  a\ncivil suit for damages.  Perry v. State, 846 So.2d 584 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003).\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[no State shall] deprive any person of life,\nliberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. State laws that\nmandate behavior by state officials implicate the Fourteenth Amendment, in that “[explicit,]\nmandatory language in connection with requiring specific substantive predicates demands a\nconclusion that the State has created a protected liberty interest.” Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460,\n471-472 (1983). Put differently, “a State creates a protected liberty interest by placing substantive\n- 5 -\n5 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 6 of 45 \nlimitations on official discretion.” Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 249 (1983); See also\nChandler v. Baird, 926 F.2d 1057, 1060-1061 (11th Cir. 1991) (“A state may, however, create a\nliberty interest which is protected by the Due Process Clause, and does so by placing substantive\nlimitations on official discretion.”) (citations omitted). Use of the words “shall,” “must,” or\n“will” in a state statute that deal with official behavior is primae facie evidence of an enforceable\n14th Amendment liberty interest. Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 471-472. \nSection  901.211(2),  Florida  Statutes,  explicitly  limits  the  discretion  of  Florida  law\nenforcement officers. The law states that “[n]o person arrested for  a  traffic, regulatory, or\nmisdemeanor offense . . . shall be strip searched” unless the alleged crime is violent in nature or\ninvolves a weapon or controlled substance, unless there is probable cause to believe that the arrestee\nis concealing a weapon, a controlled substance, or stolen property, or unless a judge at first\nappearance has found that the person arrested cannot be released either on recognizance or bond.\nThus, traffic, regulatory, or misdemeanor arrestees have a right not to be strip searched unless\nspecific conditions precedent are met.  Since Florida Statute § 901.211(2) puts a substantive limit\non the discretion of Florida law enforcement officers in conducting strip searches, a liberty interest\nis created that is enforceable under the 14th Amendment. \nSection 901.211(5), Florida Statutes, also states that “[n]o law enforcement officer shall\norder a strip search within the agency or facility without obtaining the written authorization of the\nsupervising officer on duty.” There is no discretion here either. The law enforcement officer must\nhave the written authorization of the supervising officer on duty to conduct the strip search. Thus,\nplaintiff’s contend that because Florida Statute § 901.211(5)  puts a substantive limit on the\ndiscretion of Florida law enforcement officers in conducting strip searches, there is a liberty interest\nthat is enforceable under the 14th Amendment.  Defendants dispute this point of law.\n- 6 -\n6 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 7 of 45 \nC. Federal Class Action Law:\nClass action certification under Federal Rule 23 has been the preferred method for dealing\nwith cases challenging blanket jail pre first appearance strip search policies.  See, Smith v.\nMontgomery County, 573 F.Supp. 604 (Dist. MD 1983); Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16\n(Dist. Mass 2000); Nielsen v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19 (Dist. ME 2003); Tardiff v. Knox\nCounty, 218 F.R.D. 332 (Dist. ME 2003); Doe v. Calumet City, Illinois, 128 F.R.D. 93 (ND Ill.\n1989); Mary Beth G v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1267, fn.2 (7th Cir. 1983); Maneely v.\nCity of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69 (SD NY 2002).\nOn April 9, 2004, the First District Court of Appeal in Tardiff v. Knox County, et al.,\nconsolidated with Nielsen v. York County, et al., upheld the certification of two blanket strip\nsearch cases under Federal Rule 23(b)(3).  (365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004).) \nThe advantages of certification in blanket strip search cases is manifest where the\ncommon issues of law or fact predominate over individual issues.  In this class action case before\nthis Court for preliminary approval of the proposed class settlement, the benefits to the parties\ninclude, for defendants, a complete settlement of all claims of persons in the class with claims for\ndamages arising during the period from March 5, 2000, through February 28, 2005, and obtaining\nres judicata effect of the settlement.  For plaintiffs, the settlement of the class action provides a\nfund adequate to pay claims of all those persons submitting the requisite claim form who were\nstrip searched in violation of federal law or strip searched without the prior written authorization\nrequired by Florida state law, at or above the minimum payment to which they would be\notherwise entitled if they had established their individual entitlement to damages under the\nrelevant law, without the consumption of time and uncertainty litigation entails.  \n- 7 -\n7 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 8 of 45 \nIV.

Purpose:\nThe purpose of the proposed settlement is fully and finally to resolve all claims for\ndamages which any person strip searched in violation of state or federal law at the Miami-Dade\nPre-Trial Detention Center and the Women’s Detention Center, prior to first appearance, during\nthe period from March 5, 2000, through February 28, 2005, might have; to provide adequate\ncompensation for each such person; to ensure that defendants, once the settlement funds have\nbeen distributed, shall be fully and finally relieved of all further liability to any persons in the\nclass and bound by the Court’s final judgment; and to provide a mechanism by which persons\nwishing to opt out of the proposed settlement, either to abandon their claims or to prosecute them\non their own behalf, or to challenge the fairness of the proposed settlement, may do so.\nTo accomplish the above-stated purposes, the parties entered into negotiations, facilitated\nby retired Circuit Court Chief Judge Gerald T. Wetherington, acting as mediator, and negotiated\nthe stipulated settlement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit “2”. \nThe principle provisions of the attached settlement are the following:  \nB. Description of Class Members\nThe settlement class is divided into three sub-classes defined as follows:\nSubclass A:  All females arrested on municipal ordinance, infraction or misdemeanor\ncharges, not involving violence, drugs or weapons, who were transported to the Women’s\nDetention Center and who were strip searched prior to their first appearance, excluding females\nstrip searched on “probable cause” reported in writing on an incident form1; \n1\n  Preliminary queries to the database maintained by the Miami-Dade County Corrections and\nRehabilitations Department indicate there may be approximately 10,000 claims in this sub-class.  \n- 8 -\n8 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 9 of 45 \nSubclass B:  All females arrested on charges relating to prostitution included on the list of\nprostitution charge attached as an exhibit to the Stipulation of Settlement, who were strip\nsearched prior to first appearance from March 5, 2000, until February 8, 2005, when the practice\nof strip searching all females charged with prostitution was officially terminated2; and\nSubclass C:  All persons arrested on felony charges or on charges relating to violence,\ndrugs or weapons who were strip searched, prior to their first appearances, without a written\nauthorization for the strip search having been first obtained from a supervising officer from\nMarch 5, 2000, until February 28, 2005, the date when the policy of strip searching detainees\nprior to obtaining a written authorization was terminated3.  \nSubclass A is intended to include all women who were strip searched pursuant to a\nblanket policy which provided that all women arriving at the Women’s Detention Center and\nheld prior to their first appearance were strip searched regardless of the charges on which they\nwere arrested, and regardless of whether they had been previously strip searched at the Pre-Trial\nDetention Center.  \nThe subclass defined in paragraph B above is intended to include all women charged with\nprostitution offenses but not felony offenses or misdemeanor offenses including violence, drugs\nor weapons, who were strip searched pursuant to a policy which provided for the strip search of\nperson charged with prostitution offenses who were booked at the Pre-Trial Detention Center.\nThe subclass defined in paragraph C above is intended to include all persons charged with\noffenses which made them subject to legal strip searches who were strip searched without prior\n2\n  Preliminary queries to the defendants’ database indicates there are approximately 2,000 claims in this\nsub-class.\n3\n  Preliminary queries to the database indicates there may be as many as 100,000 claims in this sub-class.\n- 9 -\n9 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 10 of 45 \nwritten authorization from a supervising officer as required by Florida Statute 901.211.\nThe class definition, by Stipulation of Settlement, has been expanded from that described\nin the First Amended Complaint to include all persons arrested on charges relating to violence,\ndrugs or weapons, including felonies, who were strip searched prior to their first appearance\nwithout a written authorization for the strip search having been first obtained from a supervising\nofficer because persons in that group, while they were subject to strip search under present law,\nwere strip searched without the prior written authorization required by Florida statutes.  A\nproposed Third Amended Complaint is attached hereto as Exhibit 3 which the parties stipulate\nmay be filed, with all new matter they deemed denied by defendants. \nC. Compensation provided by settlement:\nThe Stipulation of Settlement provides that all females who were strip searched following\narrests on charges relating to prostitution, prior to their first appearance, and all females who\nwere strip searched at the Women’s Detention Center prior to their first appearance after having\nbeen arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, will be entitled to receive a\nminimum payment of $1,000 and additional payments as follows: $500 if they were under 21 or\nover 60 at the time of a strip search; $500 if they were menstruating at the time of a strip search;\n$500 if they were more than two months pregnant at the time of the strip search; $500 if they had\na significant physical or mental disability at the time of a strip search; and $500 if the strip search\nduring the class period was the first time in the claimant’s life that she was arrested and strip\nsearched.  \nThe awards specified in the settlement agreement for these subclasses of females will be\nreduced by 50% for any female who had previously been incarcerated in a state prison.  \n- 10 -\n10 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 11 of 45 \nEach person who was strip searched legally, but without the requisite prior written\nauthorization to perform the search signed by a supervising officer on duty, shall be entitled to\nreceive the sum of $10 in full satisfaction of all of his or her claims.  \nD. Process for Claims Submission\nFollowing preliminary approval of the proposed settlement by this Court, the parties,\nthrough a retained firm4 specializing in class action claim administration, will notify the class\nmembers of the terms of the proposed settlement and make claim forms available to be\ncompleted and returned within the specified 90 day period.  The notice and claim form, copies of\nwhich are attached hereto as Exhibits 4 and 5, will direct the claimant to answer questions on the\nform which will determine the amount of compensation the claimant will receive.  The\nclaimant’s responses are supplemental to information contained in the database which will be\nused to determine eligibility for payment and entitlement to certain additional payments. \nAdditionally, a database will also be used to apply the 50% reduction factor based on prior\nincarceration in state prison.  \nThe Claims Administrator will mail the notice and claim form, by first class mail,  to the\nlast known address of each claimant in subclasses A and B and will publish a summary form of\nthe notice in newspapers specified in the Stipulation of Settlement during a two week period and\nwill make repeated radio announcements of the settlement on radio stations specified in the\nStipulation of Settlement during the same time period.  The notices and announcements will\nprovide information as to how claim forms may be received and submitted.  Notices describing\nthe settlement and claims procedure will be posted in all Miami-Dade Correctional Facilities.\n4\n  The parties have agreed that Settlement Services, Inc., Tallahesse, Florida, will act as Claims\nAdministrator and are requesting the Court appoint such firm for that purpose.\n- 11 -\n11 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 12 of 45 \nThe Claims Administrator will remail notices and claim forms to addresses specified on\nreturned undelivered mail and, if first class mail is returned a second time, will make additional\nefforts to locate claimants using additional sources of addresses available to them.\nClaim forms will be available to be downloaded from a website established by the Claims\nAdministrator and may be requested by calling a toll-free number established for that purpose by\nthe Claims Administrator.  \nAll notices, claim forms, publications and announcements will be made in English,\nSpanish and Creole languages.  \nClaim forms received by the Claims Administrator and postmarked by the Bar Date for\nsubmission of claims will be examined.  Based on the answers provided by the claimant and\nfollowing comparison with database information, the Claims Administrator will determine the\ndollar value to be assigned to each claim.  The applicability of the 50% reduction factor will be\ndetermined based on information provided to the Claims Administrator by defendants.  \nE. Opt Outs\nIn the notice to members of the class delivered by First Class Mail, published in\nnewspapers and broadcast on radio, information will be provided as to how persons choosing to\n“opt out” of the class may do so.  \nF. Settlement Funds for Claimants\nDefendants have agreed to make up to $4,550,000.00 (Four Million, Five Hundred Fifty\nThousand Dollars) available for the payment of claims submitted during the claims period.  If the\ntotal of all approved claims exceeds the funds available, payments to claimants will be reduced\nproportionately and the entire fund exhausted. \n- 12 -\n12 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 13 of 45 \nG. Payment for Claims Administration \nDefendants will pay up to $300,000.00 to cover costs relating to claims administration. \nNegotiations have concluded with Settlement Services, Inc., a class Claims Administrator, who\nhas agreed to provide services relating to notification to claimants, receipt of class claim forms,\nreview and valuation of claims, documentation of actions taken, and preparation of periodic and\nfinal accountings.  The Claims Administrator has agreed to cap the cost of these services at an\namount less than the total amount allocated for these services.  \nH. Attorneys’ Fees\nDefendants have agreed, subject to approval of the Court, to pay a total of $1,000,000.00\n(One Million Dollars) for attorneys fees and up to an additional $100,000.00 (One Hundred\nThousand Dollars) for itemized costs and expenses incident to the prosecution of this action\nincluding any fees and costs incurred in seeking final approval of the Stipulation of Settlement\nand the defense thereof in any Court or jurisdiction. This amount is 16% of the total settlement\nwhich is within the range of attorneys fees awarded in similar cases and substantially less than\nthe 33a% specified in class counsel contingency fee agreement with representative plaintiffs.  \nI. Payment to Representative Plaintiffs\nDefendants will pay $300,000.00 (Three Hundred Thousand Dollars) to representative\nplaintiffs who may include additional persons who have executed retainer agreements with class\ncounsel but who were not formally added as named plaintiffs.  This amount will not be subject to\nproportional reduction in the event the entire fund available for claims payments is exhausted.  \nJ. The Settlement is Fair and an Appropriate Method to Resolve this Litigation\nThe parties are in the process of querying the defendants’ database to determine the\nnames of each potential claimant in the three subclasses.  It is estimated that 12,000 persons may\n- 13 -\n13 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 14 of 45 \nbe in subclasses A and B and that as many as 100,000 may be in subclass C.  Based on\nexperience with similar class action settlements, it is anticipated that 1,000 to 2,000 claims will\nbe submitted by persons in subclasses A and B and approximately 5,000 claims will be submitted\nby persons in subclass C.  \nThe settlement is structured to compensate persons illegally strip searched in subclasses\nA and B with a minimum of $1,000.00 (subject to a 50% reduction for prior incarceration in state\nprison).  Persons who were particularly vulnerable to adverse effects from such strip searches\nbased on their age, disability, pregnancy, menstruation, or first arrest/strip search experience,\nmay receive increments bringing their awards up to $3,000.00.  \nPersons in subclass C, those who suffered only a technical violation of the state statute\nrequiring prior written authorization even for a justified strip search, will be adequately\ncompensated by a $10.00 payment.  \nThese settlement amounts are well within the range of settlements paid to members of\nsimilar class action strip search cases.  \nK. Advantages of Settlement\nMany of the persons entitled to compensation under this settlement would have difficulty\nestablishing that the damages they suffered exceeded the amounts they will receive under this\nsettlement.  Because the value of each claim is minimal in the absence of this class action\nsettlement, few persons would be expected to come forward to file their own challenges to\ndefendants’ strip search policies and procedures and would receive no compensation.  \nOn the other hand, if the matter is not settled and were to proceed through litigation to\ntrial, multiple trials could take years to complete and appeals thereafter would delay ultimate\n- 14 -\n14 of 45\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 49-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2005     Page 15 of 45 \nsatisfaction of any judgments for several more years making settlement and resolution, as\nprovided in the accompanying documents, desirable, appropriate and just.  \nV.  CONCLUSION\nFor all of the reasons stated herein, represented in the attached documents, and presented\nat the hearing of this request for preliminary approval of the settlement, the parties jointly request\nthe Court to sign the accompanying order to give preliminary approval to the stipulation of\nsettlement, and to appoint Magistrate Judge Steven Brown as a special master, and to designate\nSettlement Services, Inc. as the Claims Administrator, so that the process of notifying the class\nmembers, receiving and reviewing the claims, finally approving the settlement and effectuating\nthe settlement can proceed.\nDated: April 12, 2005 Dated: April 12, 2005\nRespectfully submitted, Respectfully submitted,\nRandall C.

The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as \nmonetary damages, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988.  Miami-Dade County has moved to \ndismiss the claims for injunctive relief, arguing that the plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive \nrelief.  For the reasons stated below, the defendants' motion to dismiss [D.E. 23] is DENIED. \nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe defendants' motion to dismiss should not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that \nthe plaintiffs could prove no set of facts in support of their claims which would entitle them to relief. \nSee Conley v.  Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).  I must take the allegations of the plaintiffs' \ncomplaint as true and must read the complaint to include any theories on which they can recover. See \nLindner v. Portocarrero, 963 F. 2d 332, 334-36 (11th Cir. 1992).  A dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) \n\"is viewed with disfavor and rarely granted. \" Brooks v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield ofF  lorida, Inc., \n116F. 3d 1364, 1368-69 (11th Cir.  1997) (citing Madison v.  Purdy, 410 F. 2d 99, 100 (5th Cir. \n1969); International Erectors, Inc. v.  Wilhoit Steel Erectors & Rental Service, 400 F. 2d 465, 471 \n(5th Cir. 1968) (\"Dismissal of a claim on the basis ofbarebone pleadings is a precarious disposition \nwith a high mortality rate.\")). Rule 12(b)(6) permits the dismissal of a complaint on a dispositive \nissue of law only when no construction of the factual allegations of the complaint can support the \ncause of action. See Executive 100, Inc. v. Martin County, 922 F.2d 1536, 1539 (11th Cir. 1991). \n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 37-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 08/26/2004     Page 2 of 4(cid:10)\nIn addition, where injunctive relief is sought, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that they face \na real and immediate threat of future injury resulting from a similar encounter with the defendants. \nSee City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 107-8 (1983) (holding that plaintiffs standing to \nenjoin use of chokeholds by police officers hinged on \"whether he was likely to suffer future injury \nfrom the use of chokeholds by police officers\").  At the motion to dismiss stage, \"[a court] must \nevaluate standing based on the facts alleged in the complaint, and ... may not 'speculate concerning \nthe existence of standing or \"piece together support for the plaintiff.\"\"' See Shatz v. Cates, 256 F.3d \n1077, 1080 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing Cone Corp. v. Florida Department a/Transportation, 921 F.3d \n1190, 1210 (11th Cir. 1991)).  However, at this stage, courts'\" presum[e] that general allegations \nembrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\"'  See Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (citing Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 889 \n( 1990)) (distinguishing between the varying levels ofp  roof required to establish standing at different \nstages oflitigation: \"In response to a summary judgment motion, however, the plaintiff can no longer \nrest on such 'mere allegations,' but must 'set forth' by affidavit or other evidence 'specific facts,' \nFed.Rule Civ.Proc. 56( e), which for purposes ofthe summary judgment motion will be taken to be \ntrue. And at the final stage, those facts (if controverted) must be 'supported adequately by the \nevidence adduced at trial.\"'). \nII. ANALYSIS \nThe plaintiffs seek injunctive relief enjoining strip and visual body cavity searches, conducted \non all pre-first appearance, non-felony female detainees, without a reasonable suspicion that such \nsearches would reveal or disclose contraband or weapons.  The defendants argue that, under Lyons, \nthe plaintiffs lack standing to seek such relief unless there is a substantial likelihood that they will \nbe injured in a similar way in the future.  In Lyons, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff- who \nalleged that he had been subjected to a chokehold by officers of the Los Angeles Police Department \nlacked standing to enjoin police use of chokeholds because the probability of future injury was \n\"merely conjectural or hypothetical\": \nIn order to establish an actual controversy in this case, Lyons would have had not \nonly to allege that he would have another encounter with the police but also to make \nthe incredible assertion either, ( 1) that all police officers in Los Angeles always \n2 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 37-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 08/26/2004     Page 3 of 4(cid:10)\nchoke any citizen with whom they have an encounter ... or, (2) that the City ordered \nor authorized police officers to act in such a manner. \nLyons, 461 at 105-06. The Supreme Court specifically noted that the plaintifffailed to allege \nthat chokeholds were applied to every person stopped by the LAPD, regardless of the \ncircumstances. In contrast, the plaintiffs in this case allege that all pre-first appearance, non \nfelony female detainees are subject to strip and body cavity searches upon arrest. The current \nnamed plaintiffs encompass three out-of-state visitors arrested for civil disobedience in \nconnection with the FT AA protests, an A ventura resident arrested for misdemeanor battery, \nand a Miami Beach resident arrested for resisting arrest without violence.  The last two \nplaintiffs were added after this suit was filed on March 5, 2004, and their arrests and strip \nsearches took place on March 17, 2004, and April 23, 2004, respectively.  Cf id.  at 108 \n(finding that the odds that Lyons would be stopped for a traffic violation and subjected to a \nchokehold were insufficient to establish standing where five months had passed between \nLyons' encounter with the police and the filing of the complaint and no other encounters \nbetween Lyons and the police had taken place).  Additionally, this case is a potential class \naction. \nThe Eleventh Circuit has not ruled, post-Lyons, on the specific issue ofwhen, if ever, \na plaintiffhas standing to seek injunctive relief with regard to allegedly unconstitutional strip \nsearches. The Eleventh Circuit has, however, applied Lyons in other contexts, and found that \nthe plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief.  See 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F. \n3d  1255,  1266 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that foster care children had standing to  seek \ninjunctive relief challenging systemic deficiencies in the system: \"when the threatened acts \nthat will cause injury are authorized or part of a policy, it is significantly more likely that the \ninjury will occur again\"); Church v. City ofH  untsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1339 (11th Cir. 1994) \n(homeless persons had standing to seek an injunction against the City of Huntsville to \nprevent the City and its employees from harassing, intimidating, detaining, and arresting \nthem solely because they were homeless).  In 31 Foster Children, the Eleventh Circuit held \nthat, under Lyons, the foster care children could seek injunctive relief for acts that were \nauthorized or part of a policy: \n3 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 37-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 08/26/2004     Page 4 of 4(cid:10)\nAs Lyons illustrates, future injury that depends on either the random or \nunauthorized acts of a third party is too  speculative to  satisfy standing \nrequirements.  However, when the threatened acts that will cause injury are \nauthorized or part of a policy, it is significantly more likely that the injury \nwill occur again. \n31 Foster Children, 329 F.3d at 1266. \nThe plaintiffs allege that there is a policy of conducting strip and body cavity searches \non all pre-first appearance, non-felony female  detainees.  I assume that the plaintiffs' \nallegations are true, as I am required to do when considering a motion to dismiss. Therefore, \nthere is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated will be injured \nin the future. \nIll. CONCLUSION \nIn sum, the plaintiffs have standing, at this stage of the litigation, to seek injunctive \nrelief enjoining strip and body cavity searches on.  The defendants' motion to dismiss the \nclaim for injunctive relief is DENIED.  The defendants are free, of course, to raise the \nstanding issue at the summary judgment stage. \nd~ay \nDONE and ORDERED in chambers in Miami, Florida, this  -z. ...  of August, 2004. \nAdalberto Jor  n \nUnited States District Judge \nCopy to:  All counsel of record \nMagistrate Judge Brown \n4 ",

The parties have proposed a Settlement which, if it receives final approval, will provide that certain persons subject to pre-\nfirst appearance strip searches at the Miami-Dade Pre-Trial Detention Centers will receive money.  Records of the Miami-Dade County\nCorrections and Rehabilitations Department show that you may have been subjected to a strip search after an arrest and before your\nfirst appearance.  To receive monetary compensation in this pending settlement, you must fill out and mail a claim form.\nIf You Wish to Claim Monetary Compensation,\nObtain, Fill out and Mail the Claim Form as Soon as Possible but No Later than September 1, 2005.\nFor more information, please read this notice.\nPLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.\nYOU MAY BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A PAYMENT.\nThere is now pending in the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, an action filed as a class action\non behalf of persons allegedly illegally strip searched by Miami-Dade County employees between March 5, 2000, and February 28,\n2005.  A Stipulation of Settlement, approved preliminarily by the Court, defines the class and sub-classes included in this settlement as\nfollows:  \na.

Whether or not you qualify as a class member will be based solely upon the Miami-Dade County records.  If\nthese records do not contain your name and show you to be within the definition of the class, you will not qualify. \nThis Notice is to inform you that a settlement has been proposed in this action and that, as a potential class member, your rights may be\naffected by the settlement.

Defendants Do Not Admit Any Liability\nPlaintiffs allege that the acts and/or omissions which are the subject of the claims covered by this action (strip searches) violated\nvarious state and federal laws.  Defendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing and deny any liability to plaintiffs or to any other class\nmembers.  The parties have agreed that, in order to avoid long and costly litigation, this controversy should be settled pursuant to the\nterms of the settlement as described in this Notice, subject to the approval of the Court.\nC. Monetary Terms of Settlement\n1. Payment of Claims\nDefendants shall pay a maximum of $4,550,000.00 under the terms of the settlement which will referred to as the Class Fund.  \nIn addition to funds reserved for the payment of Class Claims, Class Counsel will receive, subject to approval of the Court, a\nfee of $1,000,000.00 as attorney’s fees and up to $100,000.00 for reimbursement of itemized costs and expenses.

Payment to Class Members Who File Claims\nMoney for the class will be paid out based on a distribution formula, subject to payments being proportionately reduced if the\ntotal value of verified claims exceeds $4,550,000.00.  Pursuant to that distribution formula all women arrested on municipal\nordinance, infraction or misdemeanor charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, who were transported to the\nWomen’s Detention Center and strip searched there prior to their first appearance will receive a minimum of $1,000.00 (One\nThousand Dollars) (subject to possible reduction) and increments of $500.00 based on answers to questions on a claim form\nto be submitted under penalty of perjury.

Read the rest of this Notice to find out how to get a claim form.\nD. Strip Search Policy\nDefendants will not strip search persons prior to first appearance, unless prior written authorization for the strip search has been\nobtained from a supervising officer.  Defendants will not strip search, prior to first appearances, persons charged with offenses relating\nto prostitution or those arrested on infractions or ordinance violations or misdemeanors not involving violence, drugs, or weapons,\nwithout reasonable suspicion that a strip search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  \nE. Your Options as a Class Member\n1. Be Bound by, and Participate in the Settlement.\nTo qualify for a payment, you must send in a completed Claim Form to the Claims Administrator. If you receive a notice by\nFirst Class Mail, a Claim Form will be included in the notice package. You can also get a Claim Form by: (1) calling this toll\nfree number: [800-Number]; (2) visiting the website, [web site]; or (3) writing the Claims Administrator at: Haney, et al.\nStrip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, Settlement Services, Inc., 2032-D Thomasville Road,\nTallahassee, Florida 32308.\nYou have until September 1, 2005, to submit a  claim or to opt -out of the settlement.\nMail your completed Claim Form to: Haney, et al.

If you submit a claim form, you will be bound by the\nsettlement and receive money (if you are a class member).  If you do not submit a claim form but do not exclude yourself from the\nclass (as explained in the next paragraph), you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and dismissal entered in this case, but you\nwill not receive any money.\nBy participating in this Settlement you will be waiving all your rights to all claims up to and including February 28, 2005, related to\nstrip searches at the Miami-Dade Pre-Trial Detention Centers, even those of which you are not presently aware.  \n2. Exclude Yourself From the Class\nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called “excluding” yourself. If you exclude\nyourself, you can not get a payment and you can not object to the Settlement. Any Court orders will not apply to you.  To\nexclude yourself, you must sign a request for exclusion letter that states that you want to be excluded from Haney, et al. v.\nMiami-Dade County, et. al., United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Case No. 04-20516-\nCIV Jordan/Brown.

Strip\nSearch Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, Settlement Services, Inc., 2032-D Thomasville Road, Tallahassee,\nFlorida 32308.\nIf you do not follow these instructions properly, you will lose your right to exclude yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you cannot get\nany money from the Settlement of this case and you cannot tell the Court you do not like the Settlement (which is called “objecting”).\nIf you exclude yourself, you are no longer part of the class or the Settlement. But you can sue or be part of a different lawsuit about the\nclaims in this case.\nE. Fairness Hearing and Process for Objections.\nA fairness hearing will be held on September 22, 2005, at 9:00 a.m., at the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida,\nMiami Division, 301 N. Miami Avenue, Courtroom 8, Miami, Florida.  If you are a class member and do not exclude yourself, you can\ntell the Court you do not like the Settlement or some part of it at this hearing. This is called objecting to the Settlement. For example,\nyou can say you do not think the Settlement is fair or adequate.  The Court will consider your views. \nTo object, you must send a letter to the court that contains all of the following: \n1. The name and title of the lawsuit, Haney, et al. v. Miami-Dade County, et al., United States District Court, Southern\nDistrict of Florida, Miami Division, Case No. 04-20516 CIV Jordan/Brown;\n2.

A statement on whether or not you or your lawyer will ask to appear at the Fairness Hearing to talk about your\nobjections, and, if so, how long you will need to present your objections; and \n5. Copies of any documents you or your lawyer will present at the Fairness Hearing.\nAt the hearing on the proposed settlement, the Court may schedule further hearings without further notice to the class.  The matters\nconsidered at such future hearings may include, but shall not be limited to, further consideration of the fairness and adequacy of the\nproposed settlement, the determination of the settlement of individual claims filed by class members, consideration of the request for\nattorneys’ fees and reimbursement of costs and expenses to class counsel, and the form and entry of the final judgment of dismissal in\nthe event the proposed settlement is approved by the court.\nIndividually, or through counsel, any class member has the right to object to the proposed Settlement as a whole, to the amount of\nattorneys’ fees and costs of Class Counsel, or to any portion of either.  ANY SUCH OBJECTIONS MUST BE FILED IN WRITING\nON OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER 1, 2005, IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,\nMIAMI DIVISION, 301 N.

[Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (1 lm Cir.\n2000).1\nJURISDICTION\n1. This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1988, and the Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

Plaintiffs, including JUDITH HANEY, LIAT MAYER, and JAMIE LOUGHNER, and\nall those similarly situated, are, and at all material times herein, were arrested within the period\nbeginning four (4) years before November 21, 2003, and continuing to this date, and were\nsubjected to strip and visual body cavity searches at the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention\nCenter and the Miami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center.\n3. Defendant MIAMI-DADE COUNTY is, and at all material times referred to herein,\nwas, a political division of the state of Florida, that maintained or permitted an official policy or\n2\n\ncustom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of\nherein, which wrongs damaged Plaintiffs as herein alleged.\n4. Defendant MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, through the Miami-Dade County Corrections\nand Rehabilitation Department, manages and operates the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention\nCenter and the Miami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center, where the wrongs complained\nof herein occurred.\n5. Defendant CHARLES J. MCRAY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was\nthe acting director of the Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation Department,\nresponsible for administering the jail facilities in which the wrongs complained of herein\noccurred, and for making, overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices, and customs\nchallenged herein relating to the operation of the County’s jail facilities. He is sued in his\nindividual and official capacities.\n6. Defendant ACTING CAPTAIN M. ALADRO is the Facility Supervisor at the Miami-\nDade County Pre-Trial Detention Center, responsible for making, overseeing, and implementing\nthe policies, practices and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the Pre-Trial\nDetention Center. He is sued in his individual and official capacities.\n7. Defendant CAPTAIN M. Fuller is the Facility Supervisor at the Miami-Dade County\nWomen’s Detention Center, responsible for making, overseeing, and implementing the policies,\npractices and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the Pre-Trial Detention\nCenter. She is sued in her individual and official capacities.\n8. Defendants MIAMI-DADE COUNTY CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION\nDEPARTMENT OFFICERS DOE 1 through DOE 150, sued herein by their fictitious names, are\n-3-\n\nall Correctional Officers who, as part of their duties at the Pretrial Detention Center, subjected\nPlaintiffs to pre-arraignment strip and visual body cavity searches without first having, and\nrecording in writing, a particularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive\nof contraband or weapons. They are sued in their individual capacity.\n9. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the Defendants was acting under the\ncolor of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages\nof the state of Florida, the COUNTY OF MIAMI-DADE, and/or the Miami-Dade County\nCorrections and Rehabilitation Department.\nFACTS\nA. JUDITH HANEY\n10. Plaintiff, JUDITH HANEY is, and at all times material hereto was, a resident of the\ncity of Oakland, California.\n11. On or about November 21, 2003, Plaintiff JUDITH HANEY was sitting on the\nsidewalk across from the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention Center, along with three other\nwomen and three men, when they were arrested allegedly for \"failing to disburse\" and taken\nacross the street to the Detention Center to be booked. Plaintiff HANEY and the other women\narrested were separated from the males and, one at a time, taken to a separate area where each\nwoman was made fully to disrobe, placing each of her items of clothing on a table, then to bend\nover, exposing her anus and vaginal area for inspection by Defendants and then made to squat\nand to \"hop like a bunny\" three times before being permitted to put her own clothes back on.\n12. When PlaintiffHANE¥ was naked, Defendant JANE DOE 1 noticed a naval piercing\nand ordered Plaintiff HANEY to remove it. When Plaintiff HANEY was unable to remove the\n-4-\n\nnavel ring, JANE DOE 1 obtained a wire cutter and clipped it off. During the entire time\nPlaintiff HANEY was standing naked in an area with the door open and with people passing by\nwho could freely observe her.\n13. Over the next several hours, Plaintiff HANEY and others were transported in paddy\nwagons to various locations finally arriving at the Turner-Gilford-Knight Miami Detention Center\n(hereinafter referred to as \"TGK\") where she was again processed and held in various holding\ntanks until she was released after approximately 35 hours.\n14. On or about February 5, 2004, all charges against Plaintiff HANEY and others\narrested with her were dismissed.\n15. Plaintiff HANEY is a 50 year old management employee of Genetech Corporation.\nShe was humiliated and embarrassed by being subjected to the aforementioned visual body cavity\nsearch and by being required to stand, naked, for any passerby to observe. She suffered mental\nand emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving her\nof rights secured to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n16. Miami, Miami-Dade County, and the State of Florida, are aggressively seeking to\nhave the City of Miami designated as the host city for the headquarters of the Free Trade Area\nof the America’s (hereinafter referred to as \"FTAA\"). If Miami is so designated, it is likely that\nPlaintiff HANEY will again demonstrate against its trade policies, will again be arrested, and will\nagain be subjected to the unconstitutional strip and body cavity searches herein alleged.\nB. LIAT MAYER\n17. Plaintiff LIAT MAYER is, and at all times material hereto, was a resident of\n-5-\n\nBrooklyn, New York.\n18. On or about November 21,2003, PlaintiffMAYER was seated on the sidewalk across\nfrom Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention Center with three other women, including JUDITH\nHANEY, and three men, when they were arrested allegedly for \"failing to disburse\" and taken\nacross the street to the Detention Center to be booked.\n19. Plaintiff MAYER and the other women with whom she was arrested were separated\nfrom the males and, one at a time, taken to a separate area where each women was made fully\nto disrobe, placing each of her items of clothing on the table, then to bend over, exposing her\nanus and vaginal area for inspection by Defendants and then made to squat and to \"hop like a\nbunny\" three times before being permitted to put her own clothes back on.\n20. While Plaintiff MAYER was naked, Defendant JANE DOE 2, left the door to the\narea where the search was being conducted open so that Plaintiff MAYER could be and was\nobserved naked as people passed by and freely observed her.\n21. Over the next several hours, Plaintiff MAYER and others were transported in paddy\nwagons to various locations around Miami and finally delivered to TGK where she was again\nprocessed and held in various holding tanks until being released approximately 35 hours later.\n22. On or about February 5, 2004, all charges against Plaintiff MAYER were dismissed.\n23. Plaintiff MAYER is a student who was humiliated, embarrassed and suffered mental\nand emotional distress as a result of being subjected to the aforementioned visual body cavity\nsearch and by being required to stand, naked, for any passerby to observe. She suffered these\nand other damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving her of\nrights secured to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n-6-\n\n24. As a result of being subjected to the strip and visual body cavity searches complained\nof herein, each of the Plaintiffs suffered physical, mental and emotional distress, invasion of\nprivacy, and the violation of due process of law and federal constitutional rights, and is entitled\nto recover damages according to proof.\n25. Miami, Miami-Dade County, and the State of Florida, are aggressively seeking to\nhave the City of Miami designated as the host city for the headquarters of the FTAA. If Miami\nis so designated, it is likely that Plaintiff MAYER will again demonstrate against its trade\npolicies, will again be arrested, and will again be subjected to the unconstitutional strip and body\ncavity searches herein alleged.\nC. JAMIE LOUGHNER\n26. Plaintiff JAMIE LOUGHNER is thirty-nine (39) years of age, and at all times\nmaterial hereto was, a resident of Arlington, Virginia.\n27. On or about November 20, 2003, Plaintiff LOUGHNER was protesting at the Free\nTrade Area of the America’s (FTAA) talks near the Hotel Inter-Continental by holding a sign in\nan area reserved for protesters when a dispute arose between her and two police officers\nconcerning her right to peacefully protest. She was arrested and later charged with two\nmisdemeanors, resisting arrest without violence and failure to obey a lawful order. Plaintiff\nLOUGHNER was then taken to TGK where she was given a pat down search.\n28. Two days later, on Saturday, November 22, 2003, Plaintiff LOUGHNER was\ntransported from TGK to the Miami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center, along with seven\n(7) other women.\n29. Upon arrival at the Women’s Detention Center, Plaintiff LOUGHNER was placed\n7\n\nin one of the cubicles found near the entrance area. Plaintiff LOUGHNER was told to fully\ndisrobe and placed her clothes on a seat. She was then told while fully nude to bend over,\nexposing her anus and vaginal area for inspection by Defendants and then told to squat, cough\nand then to bend over and spread her buttocks and vagina (hereinafter \"privates\") for a visual\ninspection. She was then told to cough again while bent over with her privates pointed at the\nofficer, and to \"open up [privates] wider\" and to \"shake it.\"\n30. This strip and body cavity search procedure occurred with two guards present, one\nwho gave Plaintiff LOUGHNER instructions and inspected her privates, and the other who\nwitnessed the strip search procedure. Plaintiff LOUGHNER was then allowed to put her own\nclothes back on.\n31. Plaintiff LOUGHNER could see one of the other women detainees in the cubicle\nopposite her during the entire strip search procedure.\n32. Plaintiff LOUGHNER was released from Jail November 25, 2003. Her criminal\ncharges were later dropped and nolle prossed, and have not been refiled.\n33. The strip search and body cavity exam Plaintiff LOUGHNER experienced was\nhumiliating and embarrassing, and left her mortified.\n34. Plaintiff LOUGHNER has suffered mental and emotional distress as a direct and\nproximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving her of rights secured to her by the Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n35. Miami, Miami-Dade County, and the State of Florida, are aggressively seeking to\nhave the City of Miami designated as the host city for the headquarters of the FTAA. If Miami\nis so designated, it is likely that Plaintiff LOUGHNER will again demonstrate against its trade\n-8-\n\npolicies, will again be arrested, and will again be subjected to the unconstitutional strip and body\ncavity searches herein alleged.\nCLASS CLAIMS\n36. The named Plaintiffs bring this suit as a class action, pursuant to the provisions of\nRule 23(b)(2) & (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for injunctive and declaratory relief\non behalf of a class of all persons similarly situated.\n37. The class of Plaintiffs consists of all women who, during the period beginning four\n(4) years before November 21, 2003, and continuing to this date, were subjected by Defendants\nto pre-arraignment strip and visual body cavity searches at the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial\nDetention Center, the Miami-Dade County Women’s Detention Center, or any other jail facility\noperated by Defendant Miami-Dade County, without Defendants having, and recording in writing,\na particularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or\nweapons.\n38. The Plaintiff class consists of an unknown but large number of individuals,\nnumbering in the thousands, so that joinder of all members is impracticable.\n39. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants have the\nability to identify all such similarly situated Plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in\nDefendants’ custody at any time after November 21, 2000, were subjected to strip and/or visual\nbody cavity searches prior to arraignment without Defendants first having, and recording, a\nparticularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or\nweapons.\n40. There are questions of fact common to the class including, but not limited to: (1)\n-9-\n\nwhere Defendants routinely subject all females arrested to visual body cavity searches prior to\narraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in the Pretrial Detention Center; (2) whether\nonly females - not males - are subjected to the visual body cavity search at the Pretrial Detention\nCenter; (3) whether persons are subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment\nwithout their being any particularized reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts,\nto believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily\ncavities which could be detected by means of a visual body cavity search; (4) whether the visual\nbody cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed\nby persons not participating in the searches, or whether the visual body cavity searches are\nconducted in areas where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; and\n(5) whether the visual body cavity searches are reasonably related to Defendants’ penalogical\ninterest to maintain the security of the Pretrial detention facility and whether or not there are less\nintrusive methods for protecting any such interest.\n41. There are questions of law common to the class, including, but not limited to: (1)\nwhether Defendants may perform visual body cavity searches on persons prior to their\narraignment without particularized reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to\nbelieve any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband, which would\nlikely be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether Defendants may perform visual\nbody cavity searches on females when they do not subject males to similar searches; (3) whether\nDefendants may perform visual body cavity searches on persons without first reasonably relating\nthe use of the visual body cavity search to Defendants’ penalogical interest to maintain the\nsecurity of the Pretrial Detention Center and determining if there is a less intrusive method to\n-10-\n\nprotect that interest; (4) whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where\nthe search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating Plaintiff’s\nfederal constitutional rights; and (5) whether or not Defendants’ strip search policy and procedure\nis in accordance with the federal constitution.\n42. The claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of the class. Plaintiffs were\nsearched, prior to arraignment, without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity\nsearch would produce drugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such\nsuspicion being articulated in a supervisor approved document). Representative Plaintiffs have\nthe same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the other class members.\nPlaintiffs’ claims arose because of Defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees\nto strip and visual body cavity searches before arraignment without having, and recording in\nwriting, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.\nPlaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.\nEach class member suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity\nsearch. The actual damages suffered by representative Plaintiffs are similar in type and amount\nto the actual damages suffered by each class member.\n43. The representative Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interest.\nPlaintiffs’ interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. They have\na strong personal interest in the outcome of this action and have no conflicts of interest with\nmembers of the Plaintiff class. The named Plaintiffs were all subjected to strip and visual body\ncavity searches without legal justification. As long as the policies, practices and customs of the\nDefendants continue to permit dehumanizing invasive strip and visual body cavity searches, the\n-11-\n\nnamed Plaintiffs, and the class they represent, are and will remain at high risk of being subjected\nto searches in clear violation of established constitutional rights.\n44. The named Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel who specialize in civil\nrights litigation.\n45. The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create\na risk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class\nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.\n46. The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create\na risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would,\nas a practical matter, substantially impair or impede the ability of the other members of the class\nto protect their interests.\n47. The Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby\nmaking appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\n48. A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and equitable\nadjudication of the controversy between the parties. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\nthereupon allege, that the interests of members of the class in individually controlling the\nprosecution of a separate action is low in that most class members would be unable individually\nto prosecute any action at all. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most\nmembers of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them. Plaintiffs are informed\nand believe, and thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum\nbecause all of the claims arise in the same location. It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve\nthe common questions of law and fact in one form, rather than in multiple courts.\n-12-\n\nCOUNT ONE\n(Violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution\non Behalf of Plaintiffs and All Persons Similarly Situated)\n49. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of named\nDefendants and the individual correctional officers sued herein by the fictitious names DOEs 1\nthrough 150.\n50. The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of\nthe alleged offenses for which Plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not\nPlaintiffs were eligible for prompt release and without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs were\neligible for and/or were released on their own recognizance. Furthermore, the searches\ncomplained of herein were performed without Defendants having a reasonable belief that the\nPlaintiffs so searched possessed weapons or contraband or that there existed facts supporting a\nparticularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would produce contraband, and those facts\nbeing articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.\n51. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants routinely\nfollow their policy, practice, and custom of requiring pre-arraignment female detainees, including\nthose processed at the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention Center and the Miami-Dade\nCounty Women’s Detention Center, to strip naked and to submit to visual body cavity searches\nwithout having, and recording in writing, a particularized reasonable suspicion that the searches\nwill be productive of contraband or weapons.\n52. In searching the Plaintiffs as alleged, Defendant DOEs acted in accordance with the\npolicy, practice and customs of Defendants MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, MCRAY, ALADRO and\n- 13-\n\nFULLER.\n53. Strip and body cavity searches, as alleged in this Complaint, are done as a matter of\nroutine, and are permitted and encouraged, in accordance with the established policies, practices\nand customs of Defendant, Miami-Dade County.\n54. Defendants MCRAY, ALADRO and FULLER facilitate, encourage, and acquiesce\nin the behavior of their subordinates, who routinely conduct strip and visual body cavity searches\nof females, as alleged in this Complaint.\n55. Individual named Defendants herein are personally responsible for the promulgation\nand continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which Plaintiffs\nherein and all those similarly situated, were subjected to the searches complained of herein.\n56. Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body cavity\nsearches complained of herein violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.\nConstitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and violated said Plaintiffs’\nrights to due process and privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, and directly and proximately\ndamaged Plaintiffs as herein alleged, entitling Plaintiffs to recover damages for said constitutional\nviolation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nWherefore, Plaintiffs pray for relief as hereunder appears.\nCOUNT TWO\n(Violation of Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\non Behalf of Plaintiffs and All Persons Similarly Situated)\n57. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and on that basis allege that Defendants, pursuant\nto policy and procedure, discriminate against women by selecting female pretrial arrestees for\nstrip and visual body cavity search but do not subject males arrested for similar crimes to these\n- 14-\n\nhumiliating and invasive unconstitutional strip searches.\n58. By selecting females for strip and visual body cavity searches only, Defendants\ndiscriminate against Plaintiff on the basis of their sex and deny to them the equal protection of\nthe laws guaranteed to them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n59. Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding subjecting female pretrial\narrestees to strip and visual body cavity searches while not requiring male pretrial arrestees to\nundergo the same or similar procedure violated Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment right to the\nequal protection of the laws and directly and proximately damaged Plaintiffs as herein alleged,\nentitling Plaintiffs to recover damages for said constitutional violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n1983, in addition to other damages.\nWherefore, Plaintiffs pray for relief as hereunder appears.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nA. For declaratory and injunctive relief declaring illegal and enjoining, preliminarily and\npermanently, Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs of subjecting female pre-arraignment\ndetainees to strip and visual body cavity searches without having and recording in writing a\nreasonable suspicion that such searches would be productive of contraband or weapons;\nB. For declaratory and injunctive relief declaring illegal and enjoining, preliminarily and\npermanently, the policy of selectively subjecting female pre-arraignment detainees to strip and\nvisual body cavity searches while not so subjecting male pre-arralgnment detainees to such\nsearches;\nC. Certification of this action as a class action, designation of Plaintiffs as class\nrepresentatives and counsel as class counsel;\n-15-\n\nD. For compensatory, general, and special damages for each representative and for each\nmember of the class of Plaintiffs, as against all Defendants;\nE. Exemplary damages as against all of the individual Defendants in an amount sufficient\nto deter and to make an example of those Defendants;\nF. Attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and\nG. The cost of this suit and such other relief as the court finds just and proper.\nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED\nPlaintiffs demand trial by jury as to all issues triable as a right before a jury.\nDated: March 5, 2004 Respectfully submitted,\nMark E.

Plaintiff Class was represented by Class Counsel Mark E, Merin \nof the Law Office of Mark E. Merin and Randall C. Berg, Jr, ofthe Florid~l Justice Institute; \nDefendants were represented by Jeffrey P. Ehrlich, Assistant County Attorney. \nI \n30f8 \n\nAfter considering the submissions of the parties, including the Stipulated Motion for \nPreliminary Approval of Provisional Settlement Class and Settlement of Class Action, together \nwith the extensive exhibits attached thcreto; the unopposed Application of Class Counsel for \nApproval of Stipulated Attorney's Fees and Reimbursement of Costs; the Parties' Joint \nSubmission in Support of Final Approval of Stipulated Settlement; the Submission from the \nClass Claims Administrator; and the Arguments of Counsel, it is hereby \nORDERED, and ADJUDGED AS FOLLOWS: \n1.  On April 18, 2005, this Court entered its Order preliminarily approving settlement of \nthe above-captioned class action.  Since the entry of the Court's preliminary Order, in accordance \nwith the Stipulation of Settlement as proved to the satisfaction of the Court, the requisite notice \nof Settlement, with opt-out and objection information, was published in the New Times (May 26, \n2005, June 2, 2005, and June 9, 2005), the Miami Herald (June 1,2005, and Junc 4, 2005), El \nNuevo Herald (June I, 2005, and June 4, 2005, in Spanish), the Soulh Florida Sun-Sentell/ial \n(May 30, 2005, and June 4, 2005), the Miami Times (June 8, 2005, and June 15,2005), and the \nKey West Citizen (June I, 2005, and June 4, 2005), broadcast by radio in three languages on \nWHYI FM 100.7 (Anglo), WPOW FM 96.5 (urban), WEDR FM 99.1 (Urban). WRTO FM 98.3 \n(Hispanic), WXDJ FM 95.7 (Hispanic), and WJCC 1700 (Creole); and notice of the Settlement \nand approved claim forms were posted by First Class U.S. Mail to the last known address of each \nperson in groups one and two of the settlement class.  Both the published notice and the mailed \nnotice specified that claim fonns had to be delivered to the Claims Administrator, post marked \nnot later than September 1,2005. \n2.  Both the published and mailed notices specified that any person who chose to object to \nthe Settlement, either personally or through counsel, and desired to appear at the Fairness \n40fS \n\nHearing, was required to submit a Notice of Intention to Appear, together with written arguments \nin sup.p,.o..r t of any objection, by September I, 2005.  No written objections were received by the \nCourt.  Furthermore, although oppoltunity was given by the Court to voice objections at the time \nof the Fairness Hearing, no objections were stated by any member of the class or representative \nof any such class member. \n3.  The Court is satisfied from all of the memoranda oftaw, declarations, and exhibits \nsubmitted to the Court, that the Stipulation of Settlement is, and the Court now finds, that the \nStipulation of Settlement is fair and finally approves it as such.  The Stipulation of Settlement is \nincorporated herein by this reference as if set out in full. \n4.  The members of the settlement class include all of the following: \na.  All females arrested on municipal ordinance, infraction or misdemeanor \ncharges not involving violence, drugs or weapons who were transported to \nthe Women's Detention Center and strip searched prior to their first \nappearance from March 5, 2000, until April I J, 2004, excluding females \nstrip searched on \"probable cause\" reported in writing on an incident form; \nand \nb.  All females arrested on charges relating to prostitution included on the list \nofproslitution charges attached as Exhibit 5 to the Stipulation of \nSettlement, who were strip searched prior to first appearance from March \n5,2000, until February 8, 2005, when the practice of strip searching all \nfemales charged with prostitution was officially terminated; and \nc.  All persons arrested felony charges or on charges relating to violence, \ndrugs or weapons who were strip searched, prior to their first appearances, \n..... \nM(\"'~f  A\",,,, W'c;,A!:.t,;.f<  oltd  ~  ,,~~') \n50lS  Sc.1Hc.\"\"t>'l+·  ~I!-\\  1M~ hr.;\"  \\J  dcffl:sr. . .>  ~'\" \n\nwithout a written authorization for the strip search having been first \nobtained from a supervising officer from March 5, 2000, until February \n28,2005, the date when the policy of strip searching detainees prior to \nobtaining a written authorization was terminated. \n5.  Persons who previously commenced civil litigation challenging the legality of any \nstrip search at Miami-Dade Department of Corrections and Rehabilitationjails during the class \nperiod and have prevailed, settled or had their oomplaints denied on their merits, and persons \nwho have given timely notice of their election to be excluded from the settlement class are not \nincluded in the settlement class. \n6.  With the exception of any individuals who submitted timely requests to the Court to \nopt-out of the Stipulation of Settlement (the Court is not aware of any such requests), all claims \nand complaints of the named representative plaintiffs, together with all persons in the settlement \nclass, are now dismissed with prejudice as to all of the Released Persons defined to include the \ndefendants and their predecessors, successors, and/or assigns, together with past, present and \nfuture officials, employees, representatives, attorneys and/or agents of the COUNTY OF \nMIAMI-DADE.  Claims and complaints of such persons are now forever barred, and all \nsettlement class members are enjoined from asserting against any Released Person or persons any \nand all claims which the settlement class members had, have, or may have in the future arising \nout of the facts alleged in the Complaint. \n7.  Each Released Person is released from the claims which any settlement class member \nhas had or may in the future have against any such Released Person arising out of the facts in the \nComplaint. \n6018 \n\n8.  This Court explicitly finds that the Stipulation of Settlement, which is now made final \nby this Judgment, was entered into in good faith, is reasonable, fair and adequate, and is in the \nbest interest of the Class. The Court expressly approves payment to Class Counsel the Law \nOffice of Mark E. Merin, Caspers, Meadows, Schwartz & Cook, and the Florida Justice Institute, \nInc. of the amount of One Million Dollars ($1.0 million) as and for attorney's fees for the \nrepresentation of the settlement class members herein, to be paid as provided in the Stipulation of \nSettlement, together with costs not to exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars (S I 00,000) \nitemized by Class Counsel and submitted to defendants for review. \n9.  The Court further explicitly approves payment from the payment fund of a total of \nThree Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000) to be divided among the representative plaintiffs, \nas specified in the Stipulation of Settlement.  The Court finds the amount is fair and adequate in \nview of the damages suffered by the representative plaintiffs and the efforts they expended in \nlitigating this case in the several years since the underlying events occurred which gave rise to the \nfiling of the Complaint. \n10.  Pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, defendants have allocated Six Million, Two \nHundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($6.25 million) to pay verified claims, the representative \nplaintiffs, Class Counsel, the Claims Administrator, and to reimburse Class Counsel's costs. \nClaims have been submitted to and, in accordance with the claims processing procedure specified \nin the StipUlation of Settlement, will be reviewed, valued, and paid by the Claims Administrator \nas soon as practicable following the effective date of this Judgment, meaning the date il is \nentered and becomes final.  The Judgement will be deemed final only upon the expiration of the \ntime to appeal or, ifa Notice of Appeal is filed, upon exhaustion of all appeals and petitions [or \nWrit of Certiorari. \n70U \n\nII.  The Court reserves continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the parties in this \naction, including defendants and all settlement class members, to administer, supervise, and \nconstrue and enforce the settlement in accordance with the tenus for the mutual benefit of all of \nthe parties. \n12,  It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the Complaint in this action be \ndismissed with prejudice and that Judgment be and the same hereby is entered pursuant to the \nterms of this Order. \n'\"\"  d~ of  (.Ic~1ou \nDone and Ordered in Miami, Florida, Miami-Dade County this 23,,1 day 01 Septemfier, \n2005. \nHonorable Adalberto lordan \nUnited States District Court Judge \ncopies to: all counsel of record \nPa~,,6 of6 \nB 018 ",

Plaintiffs included class claim\nallegations and indicated they would request certification of the action as a class action.  \nOn May 28, 2004, defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.  On\nJune 8, 2004, this Court issued its Order Setting Schedule, requiring mediation, and referring certain\nmotions to the magistrate judge.  That schedule set the matter for a two week trial beginning August\n22, 2005, and established other dates including the following:\nAugust 2, 2004: All motions to amend pleadings or join parties are filed.\nJanuary 3, 2005: Parties exchange expert witness summaries and reports required by\n1 of 10\n38/gz\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 38-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 12/21/2004     Page 2 of 10 \nLocal Rule 16.1.K\nFebruary 1, 2005: Parties exchange rebuttal expert witness summaries and reports\nrequired by Local Rule 16.1.K\nMarch 1, 2005: All discovery, including expert discovery, is completed.\nMarch 15, 2005: Parties to have completed mediation.\nApril 15, 2005: All pre-trial motions other than motions in limine are filed.\nMay 16, 2005: Parties  to  submit  joint  pre-trial  stipulation  and proposed jury\ninstructions\nThe parties have proceeded diligently, have exchanged documents, and have taken deposition\nof one of the Plaintiffs and eight correctional officers employed by Defendants.  Based on\ninformation disclosed in those depositions, Plaintiffs will soon notice the depositions of additional\nemployees of Defendants, have served additional requests for production of documents, and have\nserved interrogatories designed to determine the number of persons in the class Plaintiffs seek to\nrepresent.  Defendants have noticed the depositions of the remaining Plaintiffs.\nThe parties have also agreed to attempt to resolve this dispute through mediation, and that\nmediation is now scheduled to begin February 7, 2005.  In order to promote the resolution of this\ndispute and, if not resolved, to properly present it for trial, the parties jointly propose a modification\nof the Order Setting Schedule.  A copy of a proposed modified Order Setting Schedule is attached\nas Exhibit A.  \nA. Proposed Modification of Order Setting Schedule\nThe Order Setting Schedule issued on June 8, 2004, set the matter for a two week jury trial\nto begin on August 22, 2005, and established a series of other dates which, by this motion, the parties\n- 2 -\n2 of 10\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 38-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 12/21/2004     Page 3 of 10 \nare jointly requesting the court to modify.  \nCounsel have agreed that the complaint may be modified to clarify Plaintiffs’ legal position\nthat a violation of the Florida State Statute restricting strip search of arrestees prior to first\nappearance constitutes a recognition of a liberty interest which cannot be denied without due process.\nThe parties also agree that all such motions to amend pleadings may be filed on or before March 1,\n2005.  \nBecause the parties are pursuing resolution of this dispute through mediation and believe that,\nif mediation is not successful, the nature, identity and necessity of expert witnesses may be affected\nby the Court’s ruling on various anticipated motions, the parties agree that exchange of expert\nwitness summaries and reports should be deferred to April 1, 2005, and the exchange of rebuttal\nexpert witness summaries and reports required on or before May 2, 2005.  \nSince the nature and scope of discovery will depend upon the Court’s ruling on Plaintiffs’\nanticipated motion for class certification, the parties agree that discovery, including expert witness\ndiscovery, should be held open until July 1, 2005, and that all pre-trial motions, other than motions\nin limine should be filed by August 15, 2005.  \nThe parties agree that the two week trial should be continued from August 22, 2005, to begin\non or after December 5, 2005 (consistent with the Court’s calendar), with calendar call to be held\non or after November 29, 2005, and all joint pre-trial stipulations and proposed jury instructions to\nbe filed by September 15, 2005.  \nAll other provisions of the June 8, 2004, Order Setting Schedule would remain as originally\nordered.  \nThis joint motion is supported by the affidavit of Mark E.

MERIN IN SUPPORT OF \nAGREED MOTION FOR ORDER TO MODIFY SCHEDULING ORDER\nI, Mark E. Merin, under penalty of perjury, do declare and say:\n1. I am an attorney licensed to practice in the state of California and before the Federal\nDistrict Courts in the state of California, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal, and the United States\nSupreme Court.  I have also been specially admitted, pro hac vice, to appear before this Court as\ncounsel for Plaintiffs.  \n2. The Complaint alleges that Defendants illegally strip searched females arrested for\nminor crimes at various facilities maintained and operated by Defendants prior to their first\nappearances.  At the time the First Amended Complaint was filed on May 1, 2004, Plaintiffs and\ntheir counsel had very little information about the policies, practices and procedures challenged by\nthis Complaint, other than the experiences of Plaintiffs themselves.  \n3. Even before the scheduling order was issued on June 8, 2004, Defendants had moved\nto dismiss Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief, a motion that was not denied until August 24,\n6 of 10\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 38-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 12/21/2004     Page 7 of 10 \n2004, after the specified date in the scheduling order for motions to amend pleadings or join parties\nhad expired.  \n4. While the parties were directed to attempt to pursue mediation, dates for the exchange\nof expert witness summaries and reports were established in January and February, prior to the\nearliest date when mediation could have been initiated.  \n5. The parties have diligently discovered the case and have exchanged documents and\ntaken the depositions of eight of Defendants correctional officer employees, and one of the\nrepresentative Plaintiffs.  Additionally, depositions have now been scheduled of other witnesses\nwhose identity and significance was discovered during the depositions of other witnesses, and further\ndocument production request and interrogatories served.  Defendants have noticed the deposition of\nadditional plaintiffs and those depositions will proceed in January 2005.  \n6. The scheduling order previously established is, in light of the nature and complexity\nof this case, unrealistic and virtually impossible to meet given the legal and factual complexity of\nthe case and its final determination affected by court rulings on motions which have not yet been\npresented, specifically plaintiffs’ anticipated motion for class certification.\n7. The parties have worked cooperatively and are now embarking on a good faith\nattempt to resolve the matter through mediation scheduled for February 7 and 8, 2005.  In order for\nresources to be focused most advantageously on achieving results in the mediation, the parties have\nmet and conferred and jointly agree that the scheduling order should be modified as set out in this\nagreed motion and the accompanied proposed order to allow the parties to focus on mediation and,\nthereafter, if necessary, to move the matter toward trial following completion of discovery and\npreparation and disclosure of expert witnesses.  \n- 2 -\n7 of 10\n\nCase 1:04-cv-20516-AJ     Document 38-2     Entered on FLSD Docket 12/21/2004     Page 8 of 10 \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the above is true and correct and that this Declaration\nwas executed this 20th day of December 2004, in Sacramento, California.\n___________s/__________________\nMark E.

      "title": "Statement of Judy Haney to the Commission on Safety and Abuse in America’s Prisons",
      "text": "Statement of Judy Haney to the Commission on Safety and Abuse in \nAmerica’s Prisons \nApril 19, 2005 \nIntroduction \nGood morning. I’d like to thank the Commission for inviting me to speak today regarding \nmy personal experience of being strip-searched in Miami-Dade County. \nI am the lead plaintiff in a federal class action suit filed against Miami-Dade County in March \n2004 for the unconstitutional and unlawful practice of strip searching and visually inspecting \nthe body cavities of women arrested for non-violent, non-drug or weapons related \nmisdemeanors in Miami-Dade County Detention Facilities. \nI am here to speak to you today about the details of my strip search, what it felt like, why I \nfiled a class action suit, and what we discovered about Miami-Dade’s practice of strip \nsearching women prior to first arraignment. \nWhat I hope the Commission will understand at the end of my testimony is that the type of \nstrip search that I and thousands of women experienced  was about humiliation and control, \nnot about safety — just as rape is about violence and not about sex. I also hope that the \nCommission will understand that the people most likely to be subjected to this \nunconstitutional and unlawful abuse are very rarely privileged to seek a remedy. Finally, this \npractice is not limited to a county in South Florida but happens across the country. \nPersonal Account of Being Strip Searched  \nOn November 21, 2003, during the FTAA protests, I was arrested for Failure to Obey \nduring a jail solidarity rally in front of the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention Center. \nSince I and the others I was arrested with were already in front of the jail, the police were \nable to arrest us and march us over to the Detention Center about 100 yards away, where the \npolice handed us over to corrections officers for processing. \nWe went through the routine process of giving our names, having our pictures taken, being \nfrisked and asked to empty our pockets and so forth. Then they marched me and the three \nother women I was arrested with into a hallway and sat us down on a bench. I thought we \nwere just sitting waiting to experience the next dull aspect of being “processed.” \n1 \n\nThe hallway was not that long, with doors on either end and several doors that appeared to \nopen into small rooms. There were three female corrections officers in the hallway with us. \nThey opened one door and removed a woman from that room and moved her to the room \nfarthest from us. Then one of the guards took the first woman from my group into the \nroom. I heard the guard tell her to remove her clothes. Hearing that startled and surprised \nme. We had not done anything that involved drugs or weapons; we were behaving peacefully \nand had been compliant with the requests of the corrections officers during the booking \nprocess. There had been no indication during our arrest and subsequent frisking and \nprocessing that the police or corrections officers considered us a threat in any way. \nI leaned over to the young woman to my left and said in a very quiet voice, “Are they strip \nsearching us? That’s unconstitutional.” I’m not sure I’d even taken a breath when the guard \nstanding nearest came over to me and in a very severe tone asked, “Are you refusing?” \nWhat happened next happened very quickly, but in my mind I had a lot to consider. I knew \nthat the likelihood was close to zero that if I responded, “Yes, I’m refusing — this is an \nunreasonable search and is unconstitutional,” that the guard would say, “Oh, all right — we \nwon’t do it then.” I did know from the experience of individuals that have been in similar \nsituations and had refused to be strip searched that the price of refusal could be high. \nA friend of mine in a similar situation in San Francisco refused to be strip searched, and she \ntold me that the authorities responded by putting her in what I understand to be called a \n“cold room.” Her clothes were removed without her cooperation, and she was put naked in \na bare room with a hole for a toilet and nothing to cover her except a small dirty mat that \nlooked a little like a baseball catcher’s vest. The lights were bright, and there was a window \nlooking into the room so that any one passing by could see her sitting there naked. It had a \nmetal door and someone came by I think every 15 minutes to bang on it; their story was that \nshe was behaving strangely and needed to be in that room for her “safety.” \nWith her story in my mind, I had a brief moment to consider — was I ready to go through \nthat? If I refused, would they punish not only me, but the women arrested with me? While I \nwas considering what I would do, the other women on the bench responded to the guard for \nme — saying in unison “No, she’s not refusing.” This all happened very quickly, and I knew \nthat I wasn’t ready to risk the possible consequences of refusing to be strip searched as well \nas putting the other women in jeopardy. \n2 \n\nWhen it came my turn to be strip searched, the guard led me into the same small room the \nothers had been in; it was approximately 6’ x 8’ and had a bench along one wall. The guard \nstood in the doorway and ordered me to stand facing her and to remove my clothing piece \nby piece. As I did so, I handed a piece of clothing to her; she told me to put it on the bench. \nI started to fold my clothing and put it on the bench. She told me not to do that — just to \ndrop my clothing on the bench. I proceeded to remove each piece of clothing and drop each \npiece on the bench. While I was removing my clothes, the guard continued to stand at the \ndoor and watched as another guard stood behind her in the hallway, also watching me. \nI go into this detail because it’s important to understand that this is not the doctor’s office, \nthe gym, or the spa. It is a highly controlled process in which every movement is controlled \nby a person who has the authority of force over you. There is no consent, no agency. \nAfter I removed all my clothes, the guard told me to turn around, bend all the way over, and \nspread my cheeks. I’m not sure that I can really convey the emotional and physical \ncomplexity of the situation. Bending over and “spreading my cheeks” exposed my genitalia \nand anus to a complete stranger, who had physical authority over me, so that she could \nvisually inspect my body cavities. The only way I could cope with this was to stay very \nfocused in my head and just separate from my body. The feeling was sort of like floating \nwhile also feeling like a big lump. \nThe guard’s next set of instructions were to squat — and then — to hop like a bunny. \nRemember, I’m still “spreading my cheeks,” so I can’t use my arms to balance or assist me in \nthe hopping process. Hopping-like-a-bunny was physically very difficult for me to do since \nI’ve had bad knees for over thirty years. I didn’t do it to the guard’s liking, so I had to do it \nover several times — even though I explained to her that I physically couldn’t do it. When \nthat process was complete, the guard then told me to turn around and to remove my navel \npiercing. I explained that it was unlikely that I would be able to remove it since it wasn’t \nmade to be removed. Using a threatening tone of voice she told me to remove it or she \nwould “cut it out.” I tried to remove it, but I just couldn’t unscrew the jewel. The guard then \nleft and returned with large clippers and cut the navel ring off me. She then told me to put \nmy clothes back on. \nI stood, bent over, and hopped naked under orders and in view of at least two guards in a \nsmall room with a door open to a hallway that passersby could see in for about 10 to 15 \n3 \n\nminutes. My genitalia and anus were exposed and viewable to anyone passing through the \nhallway for over 5 minutes. I would ask the Commissioners to take a moment and imagine \nwhat that feels like. \nThe Class Action Suit \nAfter getting out of jail on bail 36 hours later, I spoke with the men who were arrested at the \nsame time and inquired if they had been strip searched — they had not. This is when I \nstarted to believe that I would consider legal action against the county. To perform an \nunreasonable strip search which in effect is visual rape is outrageous enough, but to do it to \nwomen only and not to men arrested on the same minor non-violent charge revealed the \npractice to be doubly unjust. \nI did additional research and discovered that Florida state law had specific guidelines \nregarding strip-searches, none of which were followed in my case or in the case of the \nwomen arrested with me. At this point, I spoke with other activists who’d had similar \nexperiences and who referred me to an attorney who specialized in these types of cases. I \nretained the law offices of Mark Merin of California and then later added Randall Berg of the \nFlorida Justice Institute. \nAfter filing the complaint, my attorneys discovered that indeed women arrested for minor \noffenses, which were not drug or weapons related, were routinely strip searched prior to first \narraignment and that men were not subject to the same process. Additionally, they \ndiscovered that the practice had been going on for seven years despite being in violation of \nstate and federal law. The reason Miami-Dade gave for engaging in this was that, due to \novercrowding, they were housing pre-arraignment arrestees with the general population, and \nthey were concerned about contraband. However, Miami-Dade did no study prior to \ninstituting the policy that would indicate that strip searching pre-arraignment misdemeanants \nwould reduce contraband in the jail.  \nA Widespread Practice \nDuring the process of the suit, we identified a potential class size of ten- to twenty-thousand \nwomen who were subjected to these dehumanizing searches over a four year time period. \nYet we know that the practice lasted seven years. That means that it is likely that over 20,000 \nwomen were subjected to these searches. These women may be elderly, physically or \n4 \n\nmentally disabled, menstruating, or pregnant while they were forced to expose themselves \nand hop around.  \nThe other thing that my attorneys discovered that I think it’s important that the Commission \nknow, is that prior to filing the complaint, no one knew about this practice. My attorneys, \nthe Florida Justice Institute, a firm that deals specifically in prisoner’s rights, had not known \nabout the practice, and public defenders in Miami-Dade didn’t know about the practice. If \nwe hadn’t filed the lawsuit, this practice would most likely be continuing today. \nMiami-Dade has stopped strip searching pre-arraignment misdemeanants, as has \nSacramento, San Francisco, and New York City. But it took class action lawsuits to make \nthat happen. These searches happen on the door step of the prison system, not deep inside. \nIf this level of humiliation is happening to pre-arraignment misdemeanants, what’s \nhappening to the women who are deeper inside the system? \n5 ",
