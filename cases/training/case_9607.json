    "summary": "<p>On April 8, 2005, two inmates at the Camden County Jail in New Jersey filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the Sheriff of the jail and Camden County officials in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages and attorneys' fees, alleging that the defendants had violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights by strip searching them at the jail.  They argued that they should not have been strip searched because they had been charged only with petty crimes and traffic violations.  They also argued that a subclass of plaintiffs had paid their bail and were unlawfully detained at the time of their strip search.  </p><p>On March 27, 2006, the District Court (Magistrate Judge Joel B. Rosen) dismissed without prejudice the City of Camden, the Camden City Police Department, and the police chief, and the deputy police chief.  The Court noted that all parties had agreed to dismiss these defendants pursuant to the settlement talks that were in progress.  On February 28, 2007, the District Court (District Judge Joseph H. Rodriguez) granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, pursuant to an agreement of the parties.  </p><p>On July 17, 2007, the parties asked the District Court to dismiss the case, notifying the Court that they had reached a settlement agreement.  On June 9, 2008, Judge Rodriguez granted the request and issued an order of dismissal.  In the settlement agreement, the defendants affirmatively stated that they had stopped strip searching detainees on a blanket basis as of April 27, 2005.  They also stated that they had stopped strip searching non-indictable detainees in the absence of reasonable suspicion.  The defendants maintained that their written policy as of 2007 was constitutional, and had been reviewed by the New Jersey Department of Corrections for compliance with state law, but they agreed to consider formally revising their policy as needed.  The defendants agreed to retrain all corrections officers regarding the strip search policy, requiring all officers to sign a form reflecting their understanding of the policy.  The defendants also agreed to release, in due time, inmates who had paid their bail, rather than holding them unnecessarily.  Finally, the defendants agreed to pay $7.5 million into a settlement fund, to be distributed to plaintiffs as damages, with the named class representatives to receive $15,000 each, and with $200,000 also deducted from the larger sum to pay the costs of administration and notice regarding the settlement.  Likewise, prevailing parties' attorneys fees would be deducted from the larger sum, leaving a \"distribution amount\" from which payments would be made to the class. Final Judgment was issued on September 22, 2008.</p><p>The court maintained jurisdiction throughout the course of the consent decree. As of January 31, 2018, there was no further substantial activity in the court, and the case is now closed.</p>",

On March 27, 2006, the District Court (Magistrate Judge Joel B.

R. Civ. P. 23(a).\n27.The members of the Class and the Wrongfully Detained Subclass are both so \nnumerous as to render joinder impracticable. There are and have been hundreds of people \nstrip searched under the circumstances described herein and there also hundreds of people \nwho have arrested for misdemeanors, violations, traffic infractions, failing to make \npayment on outstanding traffic violations, failing to make payment on outstanding fines \nor other minor crimes and who are denied the opportunity to make bail or who are \nwrongfully detained after making bail and who have been transferred and placed into the \ncustody of the Correctional Facility.  \n28.Joinder of all these individuals is impracticable because of the large number of \nClass members and the fact that Class members are likely dispersed over a large \ngeographical area, with some members, including Plaintiff Hicks, residing outside of \nCamden County and this Judicial District. Furthermore, many members of the Class are \nlow income persons, may not speak English, may not know of their rights and likely \nwould have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually.\n9\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 10 of 28(cid:10)\n29.Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \nWrongfully Detained Subclass, and predominate over any questions that affect only \nindividual members of the Class and Wrongfully Detained Subclass.  The predominant \ncommon questions of law and fact include, without limitation, 1) the common and \npredominate question of whether the Defendantsโ written and/or de facto policies of strip \nsearching individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or traffic violations when \ntransferred to and placed into the custody of the Correctional Facility and/or, 2) those \nwho satisfied detainers by paying bail, yet were imprisoned long after the petty bail was \nsatisfied and placed into the custody of the Correctional Facility, violate the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written \nand/or de facto policy existed during the Class period.\n30.Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class and \nWrongfully Detained Subclass.   Both named Plaintiffs are members of the Class and \nPlaintiff Hicks is a member of the Wrongfully Detained Subclass.  Plaintiffs and all \nmembers of the Class and Wrongfully Detained Subclass have sustained damages arising \nout of Defendantsโ course of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of \nthe harms suffered by the Class and Wrongfully Detained Subclass members.\n31.The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class and \nWrongfully Detained Subclass.  Plaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the \ninterests of the members of the Class and Wrongfully Detained Subclass.\n32.A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \n10\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 11 of 28(cid:10)\nClass is impracticable given the large number of Class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed over a large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nClass to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class and Wrongfully Detained Subclass.\n33.Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and success \nin the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiffs are \nbeing represented by William Riback; Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Locks Law \nFirm, PLLC; Elmer Robert Keach, III; and Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of \nCuneo, Waldman and Gilbert, LLP. \n34.Mr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who has \nlitigated a wide variety of civil rights actions and has litigated class action lawsuits in \nstate and federal courts in five states.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated strip search \ncases against the Troy City Police Department and the Schenectady City School District, \nand was lead counsel in the Rensselaer County Jail strip search class action that recently \nsettled in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. \n35.Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Locks Law Firm with offices in Cherry \nHill and New York City, are both experienced civil rights and class action attorneys,.  \nMr. Lesser is one of this countryโs premier class action attorneys having successfully \n11\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 12 of 28(cid:10)\nlitigated civil rights, consumer protection and products liability class actions against \nFortune 500 companies in courts across the country, including both New Jersey state and \nfederal courts. Ms. Rudich has litigated scores of individual and class action civil rights \ncases against a number of Defendants in over ten jurisdictions throughout the United \nStates. \n36.William Riback is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who \nhas successfully litigated class actions in both state and federal courts in a number of \njurisdictions across the country. \n37.Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Waldman & Gilbert, LLP, \nhave extensive experience in state and federal trial and appellate courts, before law \nenforcement authorities and in proceedings before the United States Congress.  Cuneo \nand LaDuca have successfully prosecuted complex class actions, including cases \ninvolving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer protection and products liability \nin state and federal courts throughout the United States. In addition to this experience, \nCuneo and LaDuca are co counsel in a strip search class action, with Mr. Keach, that was \nrecently certified in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New \nYork against the County of Schenectady and other related Defendants. \n38.In short, Plaintiffsโ counsel have the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against the Defendants. Counsel for Plaintiffs know of \nno conflicts among members of the Class, or between counsel and members of the Class \nand Wrongful Detainer Subclass.\n39.Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendantsโ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \n12\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 13 of 28(cid:10)\nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search and false imprisonment regimen \nfor at least the past several years.\n40.This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the \nPlaintiffsโ seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Class \nmembers were subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of \nindividuals charged with misdemeanor or minor crimes and/or who were wrongfully \ndetained after making bail and transported to and placed into the custody of the \nCorrectional Facility.  In short, the Municipal Defendants and the Policy Making \nDefendants acted on grounds generally applicable to all Class members.\n41.In addition to, and in the alternative, Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule \n23(b)(3) or seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS\nFacts Applicable to the Class and Wrongful Detainer Subclass Generally\n42.The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials, such as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the employees they \nsupervise, from performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with \nmisdemeanors or other minor crimes or violations unless their is reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n43.The Camden County, the Sheriffโs Department, the Correctional Facility and \nthe Policy Making Defendants have, nonetheless, instituted a written and/or de facto \npolicy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the \nCorrectional Facility regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the \n13\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 14 of 28(cid:10)\npresence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon \nor contraband.\n44. Further, Camden County, the Sheriffโs Department, the Correctional Facility \nand the Policy Making Defendants have also instituted a written and/or de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the \nvaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Correctional \nFacility, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime.  \nFor purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred \nto as โstrip searches.โ\n45.Camden County, the Sheriffโs Department, the Correctional Facility and the \nPolicy Making Defendants know or should know, that they may not institute, enforce or \npermit enforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion\n46.The Defendantsโ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw.\n47.Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\n48.Camden County, the Sheriffโs Department, the Correctional Facility  and \nPolicy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to \nrectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all\n14\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 15 of 28(cid:10)\nindividuals placed into the custody of the Camden County Correction Facility without \nany requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written \nand/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre trial detainees routine; neither the \nnature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of \na particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of \nroutine strip searches. \n49.Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding each named Plaintiff was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Correction Facility.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable \nsuspicion. Strip searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among other \ninnocuous offenses such as, traffic violations, outstanding traffic fines and other minor \nfines. \n50. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches โ\neach member of the Class, including every named Plaintiff โ has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\n51.In addition, the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits \nstate officials, such as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the employees \nthey supervise, from detaining individuals after making bail without probable cause and \nwithout an arrest warrant. \n15\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 16 of 28(cid:10)\n52.The County Defendants and the Policy Making Defendants have, nonetheless, \ninstituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of detaining individuals \nafter making bail without probable cause and without an arrest warrant. \n53.The County Defendants and the Policy Making Defendants know, or should \nknow, that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy or practice of \ndetaining individuals after making bail without probable cause and without an arrest \nwarrant. \n54.The Defendantsโ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom detaining \nindividuals after making bail without probable cause and without an arrest warrant has \nbeen promulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly \nestablished law.\n55.As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches โ\neach member of the Wrongfully Detained Subclass, including Plaintiff Hicks โ has \nsuffered or will suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs\nLaverne Hicks\n56.Mr. Hicksโ experience is representative of both the Class and the Wrongfully \nDetained Subclass.  On or about February 11, 2005, at approximately 5:00 p.m. Mr. \nHicks was driving in the City of Camden when he was stopped by the New Jersey State \nPolice for failing to wear a safety belt. After performing a background check, Mr. Hicks \nwas arrested for failing to make a payment for an outstanding traffic violation. Shortly \n16\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 17 of 28(cid:10)\nafter arrest, Mr. Hicks was transported to the Camden City Police Department where he \nwas handcuffed to a bench pursuant to proper arrest procedures and held on $168.00 bail. \n57.After being in the custody for approximately one hour, at or about 6:00 p.m., \nMr. Hicks made bail of $168.00. Notwithstanding payment of bail, and having no other \ndetainers outstanding, the Camden City Police Department refused to release Mr. Hicks \nand instead, transferred custody of him to the Camden County Sheriffโs Department.\n58.After obtaining custody of Mr. Hicks, and after he posted bail, the Police \nDepartment and the Sheriffโs Department imprisoned Mr. Hicks, and the Sheriffโs \nDepartment transported him to the Correctional Facility and transferred custody to the \nCorrectional Facility notwithstanding the fact that there were no detainers or arrest \nwarrants outstanding for Mr. Hicks.\n59.The Correctional Facility accepted custody of Mr. Hicks at approximately \n7:00 p.m. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Hicks was ordered to remove all of his clothing and was \nstrip searched. After enduring this humiliating strip search, Mr. Hicks was then \nimprisoned in a holding cell with approximately 20 other detainees and was fingerprinted \nand photographed as though he was legally detained.\n60.On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMr. Hicks was concealing a weapon or other contraband. Indeed, no inquiry was made of \nMr. Hicks that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. \n61.As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search and false \nimprisonment conducted pursuant to the Municipal Defendantsโ policies, practices and \ncustoms, Mr. Hicks has suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, \nsuffering and mental anguish. \n17\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 18 of 28(cid:10)\nMichael Velez\n62.Mr. Velezโ experience is representative of the Class as well. On or about \nMarch 4, 2004, Mr. Velez was driving in the City of Camden at which time he was pulled \nover by the New Jersey State Police for a minor driving infraction. At that time it was \ndetermined that there was a warrant for Plaintiffโs arrest for failing remit a payment under \na previously established municipal payment schedule. Plaintiff was transported to the \nNew Jersey State Police barracks where his bail was set at $210.00. \n63.Within two hours of his arrest, Mr. Velez was transferred to the custody of the \nCamden County Sheriffโs Department who transported Plaintiff to the Correctional \nFacility. \n64.In the meantime, a friend of Mr. Velezโ who was in the vehicle with him \nalerted Plaintiffโs family and friends of the arrest. Throughout the day on March 4, 2004, \nthey attempted to contact the Correctional Facility to make bail payment. The \nCorrectional Facility, however, lacks any policies and procedures which would permit the \nimmediate payment of bail and release of persons detained on misdemeanor and other \nminor offenses.\n65.While in the custody of the Correctional Facility, Mr. Velez was ordered to \nremove his clothing and was strip searched. After enduring this humiliating strip search, \nMr. Velez was detained in the Correctional Facility from approximately 10:00 a.m. until \n8 p.m. on March 4, 2004, despite the fact that his family and friends were continuously \nattempting to post the required bail payment during this entire time.  \n18\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 19 of 28(cid:10)\n66.On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMr. Velez was concealing a weapon or other contraband. Indeed, no inquiry was made of \nMr. Velez that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. \n67.As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to the Municipal Defendantsโ (except Defendant Police Department) and the  \nPolicy Making Defendantsโ policy, practice and custom, Mr. Velez has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION\nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS EXCEPT \nPOLICE DEPARTMENT\nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law\n(Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies \nTo Avoid Constitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law)\n68.Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 67.\n69.The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons.\n70.The actions of all Defendants except the Police Department, as detailed above, \nviolated Plaintiffsโ and the Classโ rights under the United States Constitution.  Simply \nput, it was not objectively reasonable for Correctional Facility personnel to strip search \n19\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 20 of 28(cid:10)\nPlaintiffs and the members of the Class based on their arrests for misdemeanor/violation \ncharges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making Defendants to \norder/direct Correctional Facility personnel to conduct such searches or to have a police \nor practice permitting such searches. \n71.These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof Camden County, the Sheriffโs Department, the Correctional Facility and the City of \nCamden.  As such, these Defendants are directly liable for the damages of the Class.\n72.Upon information and belief, Camden County, the Sheriffโs Department and \nthe Correctional Facility are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be \nutilized in the operation of the Correctional Facility and are responsible for the \nimplementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Camden \nCounty, the Sheriffโs Department, and the Correctional Facility are each individually \nresponsible for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of the Class.\n73.Camden County, the Sheriffโs Department, and the Correctional Facility  \nknew that the above described strip search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, \nknowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and members of the Class of \ntheir Constitutional rights.\n74.This conduct on the part of all Defendants (except Defendant Police \nDepartment) represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, given that their actions were \nundertaken under color of state law.\n75.As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs and the Class have been irreparably injured.\n20\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 21 of 28(cid:10)\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOR LAVERNE HICKS AND THE WRONGFULLY DETAINED SUBCLASS AGAINST \nALL DEFENDANTS\nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law\n(False Imprisonment and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies To Avoid        \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law)\n76.Plaintiff, Laverne Hicks, incorporates by reference and realleges each and \nevery allegation stated in paragraphs 1 through 67.\n77.The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States protects \ncitizens from unreasonable detentions by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers \nfrom detaining and imprisoning individuals without probable cause and without an arrest \nwarrant. \n78.The actions of Defendants, as detailed above, violated Plaintiff Laverne \nHicksโ and the members of the Wrongfully Detained Subclassโ rights under the United \nStates Constitution by transporting Mr. Hicks and the members of the Wrongfully \nDetained Subclass to, and detaining them at, the Correctional Facility after they had \nposted bail and without probable cause and without an arrest warrant. These actions \nconstituted a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and deprived Mr. \nHicks and the Wrongfully Detained Subclass of their liberty.  The seizure and deprivation \nof Mr. Hicksโ and the Wrongfully Detained Subclassโ liberty was unreasonable and \nwithout due process of the law, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of \nthe United States Constitution.\n79.The violation of Mr. Hicksโ and the Wrongfully Detained Subclassโ Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendment rights, as described above, was conducted pursuant to a \n21\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 22 of 28(cid:10)\npolicy, custom or practice of Camden County, the Sheriffโs Department, the Correctional \nFacility, the City of Camden and the Camden City Police Department. As such, these \nMunicipal Defendants are liable for the damages incurred by Mr. Hicks and the \nWrongfully Detained Subclass for false imprisonment.\n80.The Policy Making Defendants are responsible for establishing the policies \nand procedures to be utilized and implemented in the operation of the policy regarding \nthe wrongful detentions questioned in this action. As such, these Policy Making \nDefendants are each individually responsible for the damages of Mr. Hicks and the \nWrongfully Detained Subclass.  \n81.The Policy Making Defendants knew that the wrongful detention policy was \nillegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Mr. Hicks and \nmembers of the Wrongfully Detained Subclass of their Constitutional rights.\n82.The conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \nยง1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law.\n83.As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nMr. Hicks and the Wrongful Detainer Subclass have been irreparably injured. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOR BOTH PLAINTIFFS AND THE CLASS AND \nWRONGFUL DETAINER SUBCLASS AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\nDemand for Declaratory Judgment \n84.Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 83.\n22\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 23 of 28(cid:10)\n85.The policy, custom and practice of the Defendants is unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals \nplaced into the Correctional Facility without particularized suspicion that the individuals \nin question have either contraband or weapons.\n86.In addition, the policy, custom and practice of the Defendants are \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/condoning the \ndetention and imprisonment of individuals without probable cause and arrest warrants. \n87.Plaintiffs and members of the Class and Wrongful Detainer Subclass request \nthat this Court issue a declaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search and false \nimprisonment policies of the Defendants to be unconstitutional.\nAS AND FOR A FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOR BOTH PLAINTIFFS AND THE CLASS AND \nWRONGFUL DETAINER SUBCLASS AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\nDemand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction \n88.Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 87.\n89.The policy, custom and practice of the Defendants are unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals \nplaced into the Correctional Facility without particularized suspicion that the individuals \nin question have either contraband or weapons and are allowing/condoning the \nimprisonment and detention of individuals without probable cause or arrest warrants. \n90.This policy is currently in place at the Correctional Facility, with new and/or \nprospective members of the Class and Wrongfully Detained Subclass subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs. \n23\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 24 of 28(cid:10)\n91.The continuing pattern of strip searching and falsely imprisoning individuals \ncharged with minor crimes or violations will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or \nprospective members of the Class and Wrongful Detainer Subclass and an adequate \nremedy for which does not exist at law. \n92.Plaintiffs demand that the Defendants immediately desist from strip searching \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Correctional Facility absent any particularized \nsuspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and seek \nboth a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much.\n93.Plaintiffs further demand that the Defendants immediately desist detaining \nand imprisoning individuals absent probable cause and arrest warrants and seek both a \npreliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much.\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n89.The actions of the Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that they \ncontinue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a fact that \ntheir actions are unconstitutional.\n90.It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants have no respect for the civil \nrights of individual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive \ndamages is necessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to \nthem that the requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government \nofficials in Camden County and the City of Camden.\nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY\n91.The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury.\n24\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JBR     Document 1     Filed 04/08/2005     Page 25 of 28(cid:10)\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Laverne Hicks and Michael Velez, on behalf of \nthemselves and on behalf of a Class and a Wrongful Detainer Subclass of others similarly \nsituated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief:\nA.

It \nis not from a lawyer.  You are not being sued. \nThis is a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging that corrections officers \nemployed at the Camden County Correctional Facility engaged in the practice of illegally \nstrip searching all individuals charged with non-indictable or minor offenses upon their \nentry into the Camden County Correctional Facility from April 8, 2003 until April 27, \n2005.  The proposed settlement does  not include  individuals who were  charged with \nindictable offenses at the time of their admission to the Camden County Correctional \nFacility, or who were not strip searched when they entered the Correctional Facility.  The \nProposed Settlement also addresses the alleged practice of Camden County in unlawfully \ndetaining many members of the  settlement class after they posted bail in the City of \nCamden. \nOne benefit of the settlement to class members is that each class member will be entitled \nto an equal share of a $7.5 million settlement fund, after payment of administrative costs, \nincentive awards to the representative plaintiffs, and attorneys' fees. \nVisit the Settlement website at www.camdencountystripsearch.com for additional details \nabout the settlement.  You may also get additional  information by  calling  l-800-741-\n8907 or by writing to Hicks v. County of Camden Settlement Administrator, P.O. Box \n9181, Dublin, OH  43017-4181. \nYour legal rights are affected whether you act or don't act.  Read this notice carefully. \nYOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT: \nSubmit a Claim Form  You must submit a Claim Form to receive payment \nunder the settlement.  You must submit a Claim \nForm by [insert date] to get any money. \nExclude Yourself  If you exclude yourself from the settlement, you \nwill not be bound by the Settlement or judgment \nand will not be entitled to a cash payment.  You \nwill be free to pursue your claims against the \nDefendants.  This is the only option that allows you \nto bring or be part of any other lawsuit against the \n\n-\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 37 of 50\nDefendants in this case about the same legal claims \nthat are advanced in this case.  You must exclude \nyourself from the Settlement by (Insert Date). \nObject  If you do not exclude yourself, you may write to \nthe Court about why you do not like the Settlement \nor the request for legal fees and costs.  You must \nsend a written objection to the Court \npostmarked no later than [Insert Date). \nGo to a Hearing  You may ask to speak in Court about the fairness \nof the settlement or the request for fees and costs. \nDo Nothing  You get !!!! payment.  You give up your right to sue \nDefendants on these claims later. \nThese rights and options - and the deadlines to exercise them - are explained in this \nnotice. \nThe Court in charge of this case still must decide whether to give final approval to the \nSettlement.  Likewise, payments to class members will be distributed only if the Court \ngrants final approval of the Settlement and after any appeals are resolved. \nI.  WHY DID I GET THIS NOTICE PACKAGE? \nYou  or  someone  in  your  family  may  have  been  admitted  to  the  Camden  County \nCorrectional Facility on a non-indictable offense, disorderly persons offense, warrant for failure \nto appear, warrant for failure to pay a fine, traffic violation, violation of probation or parole, or \non a family or civil court warrant from April 8, 2003 to April27, 2005 and been subject to a strip \nsearch. \nThe Court sent you this notice because you have the right to know about a proposed \nsettlement of a class action lawsuit, and about your options, before the Court decides whether to \napprove the settlement.  If the Court approves it and after objections and appeals are resolved, an \nadministrator  appointed by  the  Court will  make the  monetary  payments that the  settlement \nallows.  You will be informed of the progress of the settlement.  You should understand that the \nprocess of Court approval may take a good deal of time. \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights,  what benefits are \navailable, who is eligible for them and how to get them. \nThe Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the District of New \nJersey, Camden Vicinage, United States District Judge Joseph Rodriguez presiding.  The case is \ncalled Hicks v.  County of Camden, Index No. 05-CV -1857 (JHR).  The people who sued are \ncalled Plaintiffs, and the municipality and municipal officials they sued, the County of Camden, \nits correctional employees and elected officials, are called the Defendants. \n\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 38 of 50\nII.  WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT? \nPlaintiffs  claim  in  this  lawsuit  that  the  County  of Camden  illegally  strip  searched \nindividuals admitted to the Camden County Correctional Facility who were charged with non \nindictable crimes or other minor offenses, in violation of the unreasonable search provisions of \nthe United States Constitution. Defendants deny that they did anything wrong, and contend that \neven if they did do anything wrong, Plaintiffs are not entitled to any money as a result of being \nsearched. \nIII. WHY IS THIS A CLASS ACTION? \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case Laverne \nHicks and Michael Velez) sue on behalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of these \npeople are a Class or Class Members.  A class action resolves the issues for all Class Members, \nexcept for those who exclude themselves from the Class.  United States District Judge Joseph H. \nRodriguez is in charge of this class action. \nIV. WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendants.  Instead, both sides agreed \nto a settlement.  That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people affected will \nget compensation.  The Class Representatives and their attorneys think the settlement is best for \neveryone who are alleged to have been illegally strip searched. \nV.  HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM PART OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nJudge Rodriguez decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:  All \npersons who were admitted into the  Camden County Correctional Facility during the period \nApril 8, 2003, through and including April 27, 2005, after being charged with non-indictable \noffenses, disorderly persons offenses, violations, traffic  infractions, violations of probation or \nparole, held on civil matters or other non-indictable occurrences, and were strip searched upon \ntheir entry into the Correctional Facility in the absence of reasonable suspicion.  Specifically \nexcluded from  the  class are  Defendants  and  any  and  all  of their respective  affiliates,  legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \nAdditionally, Judge Rodriguez decided to certify a portion of the individuals detailed \nabove  as  a  sub-class.  Specifically,  Judge  Rodriguez  decided  that  everyone  who  fits  this \ndescription is a member of the Sub-Class:  All persons who posted bail on non-indictable or \nother minor offenses during the period of April 8, 2003 through and including April 27, 2005 at \nthe Camden County Satellite Unit, located at the Camden City Police Department, and who were \ndetained by Camden County for over twelve hours after the bail was posted. \n\n- -\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 39 of 50\nThe Settlement does not cover individuals charged with indictable offenses at the time of \ntheir entry into the Camden County Correctional Facility, anyone who entered the Correctional \nFacility after being convicted of (as compared to only being charged with) a crime, or anyone \nwho entered the Correctional Facility but was not strip searched as  part of the  Correctional \nFacility's booking procedure. \nVI.  DO I NEED TO PROVE THAT I WAS STRIP-SEARCHED, AND WHAT DOES \nTHAT MEAN'? \nNo, you do not need to prove that you were subjected to such a search.  In filling out the \nClaim  Form,  you  will  affirm,  under  penalty  of perjury,  that  you  were  strip  searched,  and \nDefendants will accept this affirmation.  Provided that your name is detailed in booking records \nmaintained by Camden County, your affirmation will entitle you to payment.  If your name is not \ncontained in Camden County's records, you may be asked to provide additional documentation \nbefore being allowed to participate in the settlement. \nA strip search occurred when you were ordered to take off some or all of your clothes by \na Camden County employee, with that employee watching you undress.  Some members of the \nClass may also have been forced to bend at the waist or manipulate body parts to allow for a \nvisual inspection.  If you were searched in this manner when you were booked into the facility, \nyou are a member of the  class and entitled to  make a claim.  You will  need to  provide an \naffirmation on the Claim Form confirming that one of these searches was conducted on you \nwhen you entered the Camden County Correctional Facility. \nVII.  HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER THE PRE-ADJUDICATED CRIME FOR WHICH \nI  WAS  CHARGED  UPON  ADMISSION  TO  THE  CAMDEN  COUNTY \nCORRECTIONAL FACILITY QUALIFIES ME FOR INCLUSION IN THE CLASS'? \nYou must have been brought to the Camden County Correctional Facility before a judge \nhas sentenced you (pre-adjudication) to be eligible to recover, and the charges must have been \nnon-indictable offenses.  Everyone brought to the Camden County Correctional Facility pre \nadjudication on non-indictable offenses and was strip searched is eligible under this settlement \nagreement. \nStated another way,  persons who were charged with \"indictable offenses\" as  defined \nunder the  New Jersey  Code when they  were admitted  to  the  Camden  County  Correctional \nFacility cannot recover.  New Jersey defines an indictable offense as an offense which authorizes \nin  excess of six months jail time  if convicted.  Indictable offenses are usually handled by  a \nSuperior Court Judge, and require indictment by a grand jury.  Murder, burglary and rape are \nexamples of indictable offenses.  Anyone charged with an indictable offense upon admission to \nthe  Camden County Correctional Facility, even if they were also charged with non-indictable \noffenses  at the same time, is not a member of the class unless they were, on another occasion, \nadmitted  to  the  Camden  County  Correctional  Facility  solely  on  non-indictable  or violation \ncharges. \n\n- -\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 40 of 50\nExamples of \"non-indictable offenses\" are disorderly persons offenses, traffic offenses, \nand child support warrants. Disorderly persons offenses are non-indictable offenses and are, at \nmost,  subject  to  incarceration  in  a  local  Correctional  Facility.  Non-Indictable  offenses are \nhandled  by  a  Municipal  Court  or  City,  Town  or Village  Court judge,  and  do  not  require \nindictment. Shoplifting less than $200.00, Disorderly conduct, and Loitering are examples of \ncharges which are non-indictable offenses, and fall within the class definition. Anyone charged \nwith such a non-indictable offense and upon admission to  the  Camden County Correctional \nFacility was strip searched is a member of the Class. \nThe settlement further allows for individuals to make claims if they were admitted to the \nCamden County Correctional Facility for violating the terms of their probation or parole, or if \nthey were subject to a civil commitment.  Parole is only assessed if an individual has served time \nin  state prison.  If the  individual was charged solely with  violating parole or probation (for \ninstance, not honoring their conditions of supervision or violating curfew), they are considered to \nbe a member of the class.  If an individual is charged with violating probation or parole and is at \nthe same time charged with an indictable offense, they are not a member of the class.  A civil \ncommitment is an order from a non-criminal court, usually the Family Court, committing that \nindividual to the Camden County Correctional Facility.  Individuals admitted to the Camden \nCounty Correctional Facility on a civil commitment, for example, a commitment for failure to \npay child support, are members of the Class. \nFinally, if a person was arrested and brought to the Camden County Correctional Facility \nunder traffic offenses or traffic warrants, failing to pay fines and contempt, pre-adjudication, you \nare eligible under this settlement agreement.  Consequently, if you failed to honor a payment \norder with a municipal court, and were arrested, or failed to appear for a municipal court date \nand arrested, brought to the Camden County Correctional Facility and strip searched, you are \neligible to receive a settlement payment. \nVIII.  HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER OR NOT I QUALIFY AS A MEMBER OF THE \nSUB-CLASS  OF  INDIVIDUALS  WHO  WERE  WRONGFULLY  DETAINED  BY \nCAMDEN COUNTY. \nJust prior to  April  2004,  Camden County  took over detaining  individuals who  were \narrested by the City of Camden Police Department.  The Camden County Satellite Unit, which \ncomprised the former holding cells of the Camden PD, was administered by Camden County \nCorrections Officers.  Individuals arrested by the  Camden  PD  would be  turned over to  the \ncustody of the Satellite Unit shortly after their arrest. \nMany  individuals would post bail shortly after their arrest,  but would continue to  be \ndetained by Camden County and later transported to the Camden County Correctional Facility. \nDetainees were often then held at the Camden County Correctional Facility for several hours \nuntil they were reviewed for outstanding warrants.  The sub-class certified by Judge Rodriguez \naddresses individuals arrested for non-indictable or other minor offenses who were then held for \n\n-\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 41 of 50\ntwelve hours after posting after posting bail.  If you, or someone on your behalf, posted bail at \neither the Camden County Satellite Unit, the Camden County Clerk's Office, or the Camden \nCounty Correctional Facility, and you were then held for twelve hours or more after posting bail, \nyou  are  eligible to  receive  an  additional  payment under the  settlement.  You can mark the \nappropriate box on the claim form to confirm that you were held for more than twelve hours, and \nalso claim your eligibility for the additional payment.  Class Counsel will then verify that you are \neligible to receive this additional payment. \nIX.  I WAS ADMITTED TO THE CAMDEN COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY \nBUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT MY CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE.  HOW CAN I \nFIND  THIS  OUT,  AND  HOW  DO  I  KNOW  IF  THE  CHARGE  WAS  A  NON \nINDICT ABLE OFFENSE? \nThere are several ways for potential class members to determine the nature of their criminal \ncharges.  First, you can review your charging documents, which should reflect both your actual \ncharges and whether the charges were non-indictable offenses.  If you do not have your charging \ndocument and remember the local court where you were prosecuted, the court clerk will be able \nto help you find these documents. \nIf you need additional help determining whether you are a class member, or of you have other \nquestions, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at 1-800-741-8907. \nYou can still make a claim if you do not remember your criminal charges if you believe you are \na member of the Class, but you may be asked for additional information. \nX.  I PLED GUILTY TO A CRIME. HOW DOES THIS AFFECT BY RIGHT TO \nPARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nIf you  were  admitted  to  the  Camden  County  Correctional  Facility  solely  on  non \nindictable  or  other minor  charges,  as  defined  above,  you  can  participate  in  the  settlement \nregardless of how you resolved your criminal charges, including if you  pled guilty to those \ncharges, provided that you were admitted to the Correctional Facility before being sentenced by \na court.  For most class members, this would mean that they were committed to the Camden \nCounty Correctional Facility after they were arraigned before a Judge.  If you were sentenced \nbefore admission to the Correctional Facility, meaning you were committed after pleading guilty \nor being convicted at trial, you are not a class member. \nXI.  WHAT IF I WAS ADMITTED TO THE CAMDEN COUNTY CORRECTIONAL \nFACILITY ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION?  CAN I  STILL PARTICIPATE IN \nTHE SETTLEMENT? \nYes.  Individuals who were admitted to  the Camden County Correctional Facility on \nmore than one occasion during the class period can be members of the class and can recover \n\n-\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 42 of 50\nmoney.  They can only recover one payment, however, meaning that you will not be provided \nwith extra payments if you were admitted to the Camden County Correctional Facility more than \none time. \nXII.  I AM STILL NOT SURE IF I AM INCLUDED. \nIf you are still not sure if you are included, you can ask for help.  You can call 1-800-\n741-8907 and the settlement administrator or class counsel may help answer your questions.  For \nmore information, you can also visit the website, www.camdencountystripsearch.com, or you \ncan just fill  out the  Claim Form and return  it to the  Settlement Administrator to  see  if you \nqualify. \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS- WHAT YOU GET \nXIII.  WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE? \nDefendants have agreed to pay $7,500,000 to resolve this litigation.  That money will be \nused  to:  I)  compensate  Class Members  who  have  been  illegally  strip  searched;  2)  pay  for \nnotifying Class Members and administering the settlement; 3) pay incentive awards to the named \nPlaintiffs,  Laverne  Hicks  and  Michael  Velez;  and  4) pay attorneys'  fees  and expenses.  A \ncomplete description of the settlement is provided in the Settlement Agreement.  You can get a \ncopy  of the  Settlement  Agreement  by  visiting  www.camdencountystripsearch.com  or  by \ncalling 1-800-741-8907. \nXIV.  WHAT CAN I GET FROM THE SETTLEMENT? \nThe settlement provides that all class members who make claims will receive an equal \nshare of $7,500,000, minus the costs of notice and administration, an incentive award for the \nnamed Plaintiffs, attorneys' fees, and expenses.  Class counsel anticipates, based on claims rates \nfrom  other settlements, that all  individuals who make a claim on the settlement will receive \nbetween $750.00 and $1,250.00 as a settlement payment.  These amounts are dependent on how \nmany claims are received by the Claims Administrator during the claims period, and are subject \nto change based the number of claims received.  No amount is guaranteed. \nHOW YOU GET A PAYMENT- SUBMITTING A CLAIM FORM \nXV.  HOWCANIGET A PAYMENT? \nTo qualify for a payment, you MUST send in a Claim Form.  A claim form is attached to \n\n- -\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 43 of 50\nthis  Notice.  You  can  also  get  a  claim  form  on  the  Internet  at \nwww.camdencountystripsearch.com.  Read the instructions carefully, fill out the form, sign it, \nand mail it postmarked no later than [insert date]. \nYou may be asked for additional documents, and will be contacted in writing.  You may \nwant to send in your claim form by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, to ensure that it is \nreceived by the Settlement Administrator. \nXVI.  WHEN WOULD I GET MY PAYMENT? \nThe  court  will  hold  a  hearing  on  [insert  date]  to  decide  whether  to  approve  the \nsettlement.  If Judge Rodriguez approves the settlement, there may be appeals.  It is  always \nuncertain whether those appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more \nthan a year.  Everyone who sends in  a claim form  will  be  informed of the progress of the \nsettlement.  Please be patient. \nXVII.  WHAT AM I GIVING UP TO GET A PAYMENT OR STAY IN THE CLASS? \nUnless you exclude yourself, you are staying in the Class, and that means you can't sue, \ncontinue to sue, or be part of any other lawsuit against Camden County, its employees, or its \nelected officials about the legal issues in this case.  It also means that all the Court's orders will \napply to you and legally bind you.  If you sign the claim form, you will agree to release all \nclaims that you have relating to having been strip searched. \nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT \nIf you do not want a payment from this settlement, but you want to keep the right to sue or \ncontinue to sue Camden County on your own about the legal issues in this case, then you must \ntake steps to preserve these rights.  This is called excluding yourself- or is sometimes referred to \nas \"opting out\" of the Settlement Class. \nXVIII.  HOW DO I GET OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nTo exclude yourself from the settlement, you must send a letter by mail saying that you want to \nbe excluded from Hicks v. County of Camden.  Be sure to include your name, address, telephone \nnumber and your signature.  You must mail your exclusion request postmarked no  later than \n[insert date] to Hicks v. County of Camden, c/o The Garden City Group, Inc., P.O. Box \n9181, Dublin, OH 43017-4181. \nYou can't exclude yourself on the phone or by email.  If you ask to be excluded, you will not get \nany settlement payment, and you cannot object to the settlement.  You will not be legally bound \nby anything that happens in this lawsuit.  You may be able to sue (or continue to sue) Camden \n\n-\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 44 of 50\nCounty in the future. \nXIX.  IF I DO NOT EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I SUE CAMDEN COUNTY FOR \nTHE SAME THING LATER? \nNo.  Unless you exclude yourself, you give up the right to sue Camden County for the \nclaims that this settlement involves.  If you have a pending lawsuit, speak to your lawyer in that \nlawsuit immediately.  You must exclude yourself from this class action to continue your own \nlawsuit.  Remember, the exclusion deadline is [insert date]. \nXX.  IF I EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I GET MONEY FROM THE SETTLEMENT? \nNo.  If you exclude yourself, do not send in a claim form to ask for money.  But, you may \nsue, continue to sue, or be part of a different lawsuit against Camden County. \nTHE LAW  YERS AND INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING YOU \nXXI.  DO I HAVE A LAWYER IN THIS CASE? \nThe Court approved the Seth R. Lesser of  Locks Law Firm, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, \nWilliam Riback, Esquire, Camden, New Jersey, Charles Laduca of Cuneo, Gilbert &  LaDuca, \nWashington,  District  of Columbia,  and  the  Law  Offices  of Elmer  Robert  Keach,  III,  PC, \nAmsterdam, New York, to represent you and other Class Members.  Together, the lawyers are \ncalled Class Counsel.  You will not be charged for these lawyers.  If you want to be represented \nby your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense. \nXXII.  HOW  WILL  THE LAWYERS  AND  THE  CLASS  REPRESENTATIVES  BE \nPAID? \nClass Counsel will ask the Court for attorneys' fees and expenses as a percentage of the \n$7,500,000 settlement, and payments of$15,000.00 for Class Representatives Laverne Hicks and \nMichael Velez.  The Settlement Agreement provides that twenty-seven and one-half percent of \nthe settlement fund will be paid to class counsel as an award of attorneys' fees, together with an \naward for the reimbursement of expenses.  These amounts will be deducted from the settlement \nfund before payments are made to Class Members.  The costs of administering the settlement \nwill also be deducted from the settlement fund. \nOBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT \nYou can tell the Court that you do not agree with the settlement or some part of it. \n\n-\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 45 of 50\nXXIII.  HOW DO I TELL THE COURT THAT I DO NOT LIKE THE SETTLEMENT? \nIf you are a Class Member, you can object to the settlement if you don't like any part of \nit.  You can give objections why you think the Court should not approve it.  The Court will \nconsider your views.  To object, you must send a letter saying that you object to Hicks v. County \nof Camden.  Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, your signature, and the \nreasons why you object to this settlement.  Mail the objection to these three different places \npostmarked no later than [insert date]. \nCOURT \nClerk of the Court \nU.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey \nMitchell H. Cohen Building and U.S. Courthouse \nFourth and Cooper Streets, Room I 050 \nCamden, NJ  08101 \nCLASS COUNSEL \nSeth Lesser, Esquire \nThe Locks Law Firm \n457 Haddonfield Road, Suite 500 \nCherry Hill, NJ  08002 \nDEFENSE COUNSEL \nPhilip Voluck, Esquire \nKaufman Dolowich & Voluck, LLP \n135 Crossways Park Drive \nWoodbury, NY  11797 \nXXIV. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBJECTING AND EXCLUDING \nMYSELF? \nObjecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like something about the settlement. \nYou can object only if you stay in the Class.  Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you do \nnot want to be a part of the class.  If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because \nthe case no longer legally affects you. \nTHE COURT'S FAIRNESS HEARING \nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement.  You may \nattend and you may ask to speak, but you do not have to do so. \n\n- -\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-6      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 46 of 50\nXXV.  WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE COURT DECIDE WHETHER TO APPROVE \nTHE SETTLEMENT? \nOn [insert date) the United States District Court for the District of Jersey will hold a \nfairness  hearing  in  the Mitchell H.  Cohen Building and U.S.  Courthouse.  Fourth &  Cooper \nStreets. Camden, NJ  08101  in Courtroom [insert courtroom) to determine whether the Class \nwas properly certified and whether the proposed Settlement is fair,  adequate, and reasonable. \nThe Court will listen to people who have asked to speak at the hearing.  The Court may also \ndecide how much to pay Class Counsel.  This hearing may be continued or rescheduled by the \nCourt without further notice.  We  do  not know how long it will  take the  Court to  give  its \ndecision. \nXXVI.  DO I HAVE TO COME TO THE HEARING? \nNo.  Class  Counsel  will  answer questions  Judge  Rodriguez may  have.  But you are \nwelcome to come at your own expense.  If you send an objection, you do not have to come to \nCourt to talk about it.  As long as you mailed your written objection on time, the Court will \nconsider it.  You may also pay your own lawyer to attend, but it is not required. \nXXVII.  MAYISPEAKATTHEHEARING? \nYou may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing.  To do so, you \nmust send a letter saying that it is your \"Notice of Intention to Appear in Hicks v.  County of \nCamden..\"  Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number and your signature.  Your \nNotice of Intention to Appear must be postmarked no later than [insert date) and be sent to the \nClerk of the  Court,  Class Counsel,  and  Defense  Counsel,  at the three  addresses  in  question \nXXIII.  You cannot speak at this hearing if you excluded yourself. \nIF YOU DO NOTHING \nXXVIII.  WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOTHING AT ALL? \nIf you do nothing, you will get no money from the settlement.  But, unless you exclude \nyourself, you will not be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other \nlawsuit against Camden County about the  legal  issues  in this case, ever again.  Unless you \nexclude yourself, you need to file a claim to receive a monetary payment under the settlement. \nGETTING MORE INFORMATION \nXXIX.

Any persons who wished to be excluded from this Action were provided an opportunity to \n\"opt-out\" pursuant to the Notice. All persons who have validly excluded themselves from the Action \nhave no rights under the Settlement Agreement and shall not be bound by the Settlement Agreement \nor the final judgment herein. [List attached) \n8.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the: Settlement, Settlement Agreement, \nreleases contained within the Settlement Agreement, and the Final Order and Judgment. Settlement \nClass Members do not have a further opportunity to opt-out of this Action. \n9.  Any class member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to the Settlement \nAgreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiffs' Class Counsel's application \nfor fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Class Notice and \nmandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed to have waived any \nsuch objection by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise. \n10.  On the basis of all of the issues in this  litigation, and the provisions of the Settlement \nAgreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable and adequate \ncompromise of the claims against the Defendant in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules ofC  ivil Procedure. There are a number of factors which the Court has considered in aft\"trrning \nthis Settlement, including: \na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nb. The Court noted that for settlement purposes, this Settlement has the benefit ofp roviding \nrelief to Class Members now, without further litigation, under circumstances where the liability \nissues are still vigorously contested among the parties to this litigation and among the parties to the \nindividual litigation. This Settlement provides Class Members with a substantial monetary benefit. \n3 \n\n-\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 2 of 38\nc.  This Settlement is clearly a byproduct of hard-fought litigation between the parties, and \nnot a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or Counsel for the Defendants. \nII.  Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendants their application for \nreasonable attorneys'  fees,  costs, and expenses consistent with the terms of the  Settlement \nAgreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request and hereby grants the request. \n12.  The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair, a simplified \nprocess, and workable. In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work out any unanticipated \nproblems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDING OF FACT \nAND THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS OF LAW: \n13.  This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this proceeding. \n14.  Pursuant to Rule 23 oft he Federal Rules of Ci vii Procedure, the following Settlement Class \nis certified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll persons who were placed into the custody oft he Camden County \nCorrectional Facility after being charged with non-indictable offenses, \ndisorderly persons offenses, violations, violations of probation or \nparole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other non-indictable \noccurrences and were strip searched in the absence of reasonable \nsuspicion upon their entry into Camden County Correctional Facility \npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the County of Camden. \nThe class period commences on AprilS, 2003 and extends until April \n27, 2005. Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any \nand all of their respective affiliates,  legal representatives,  heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees. \n15.  Pursuant  to  Rule  23  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  the  following \nSettlement  Sub  Class  IS  certified  for  purposes  of  final  settlement: \n4 \n\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 3 of 38\nAll persons who posted bail on non-indictable or other minor offenses \nat the Camden County Satellite Unit, located at the Camden City \nPolice Department, and after posting the required bail, were transferred \nto the Camden County Correctional Facility, and whose detention \nexceeded twelve hours after posting bail pursuant to the policy, custom \nand practice of the County of Camden. The class period commences \non April  8, 2003  and extends until April 27, 2005.  Specifically \nexcluded from the class are  Defendants and any and all of their \nrespective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees \nor assignees. \n16.  The Court fmds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a Class Action is an appropriate method for \nresolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for Class certification under Rule 23 \nare present. The Class members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined. Questions oflaw \nand fact common to all Class members predominate over individual issues and should be determined \nin one proceeding with respect to all Class members. The Class Representatives' claims are typical \nof those of the Class. The Class action mechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating \nand resolving this action. \n17.  The Settlement Class Representatives, Laverne Hicks and Michael Velez, are entitled to and \nare hereby awarded a payment of$15,000.00 each, in recognition of the efforts they undertook in \nconnection with this lawsuit. All class members who have made claims on the settlement are entitled \nto receive their pro rata share of the settlement fund after administrative expenses, attorneys' fees \nand expenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the fund. \n18.  The Court grants final approval of the Settlement Agreement, as being fair, reasonable and \nadequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n5 \n\n- -\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 4 of 38\n19.  The Courts finds that the request for attorneys' fees is reasonable. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT \nAND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, ITIS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED \nAS FOLLOWS: \n20.  The Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed Settlement is GRANTED. \n21.  The Settlement Class Representatives, Laverne Hicks and Michael Velez, are entitled to and \nare hereby awarded a payment of $1 5,000.00 each, in recognition of the efforts they undertook in \nconnection with this lawsuit. All class members who have made claims on the settlement are entitled \nto receive their pro rata share of the settlement fund after administrative expenses, attorneys' fees \nand expenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the fund. \n22.  The Class Counsels' application for attorneys' fees and expenses is granted. \n23.  This Action and all claims against the Settling Defendant are hereby dismissed with \nprejudice, but the Court shall retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction of the Action, all Parties, \nand Settlement Class Members, to interpret and enforce the terms, conditions and obligations oft his \nSettlement Agreement. \n24.  All Class members who have not timely filed an opt-out request are barred and enjoined from \ncommencing and/or prosecuting any claim or action against the Defendant.

Joeseph H. Rodriguez \nUnited States District Judge \n8 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 14 of 38\nEXHIBIT A \n\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 15 of 38\nLegal Notice \nUnited States District Conrt for the District of New Jersey \nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING \nIf You Entered the Camden County Correction Facility from April 8, \n2003  to  April 27,  2005  And Were Strip  Searched,  Then  Your Rights \nCould Be Affected By A Proposed Class Action Settlement. \nThe United States District Court for the District ofN  ew Jersey authorized this notice.  It \nis not from a lawyer.  You are not being sued. \nThis is a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging that corrections officers \nemployed at the Camden County Correctional Facility engaged in the practice of illegally \nstrip searching all individuals charged with non-indictable or minor offenses upon their \nentry into the Camden County Correctional Facility from April 8, 2003  until April 27, \n2005.  The proposed settlement does not include  individuals who were  charged with \nindictable offenses at the time of their admission to the Camden County Correctional \nFacility, or who were not strip searched when they entered the Correctional Facility.  The \nProposed Settlement also addresses the alleged practice of Camden County in unlawfully \ndetaining many members of the settlement class after they posted bail in the City of \nCamden. \nOne benefit of the settlement to class members is that each class member will be entitled \nto an equal share of a $7.5 million settlement fund, after payment of administrative costs, \nincentive awards to the representative plaintiffs, and attorneys' fees. \nVisit the Settlement website at www.camdencountystripsearch.com for additional details \nabout the settlement.  You may also get additional  information by calling  1-800-7 41-\n8907 or by writing to Hicks v. County of Camden Settlement Administrator, P.O. Box \n9181, Dublin, OH  43017-4181. \nYour legal rights are affected whether you act or don't act.  Read this notice carefully. \nYOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT: \nSubmit a Claim Form  You must submit a Claim Form to receive payment \nunder the settlement.  You must submit a Claim \nForm by [insert date] to get any money. \nExclude Yourself  If you exclude yourself from the settlement, you \nwill not be bound by the Settlement or judgment \nand will not be entitled to a cash payment.  You \nwill be free to pursue your claims against the \nDefendants.  This is the only option that allows you \nto bring or be part of any other lawsuit against the \n\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 16 of 38\nDefendants in this case about the same legal claims \nthat are advanced in this case.  You must exclude \nyourselffrom the Settlement by [Insert Date]. \nObject  If you do not exclude yourself, you may write to \nthe Court about why you do not like the Settlement \nor the request for legal fees and costs.  You must \nsend a written objection to the Court \npostmarked no later than [Insert Date]. \nGo to a Hearing  You may ask to speak in Court about the fairness \nof the settlement or the request for fees and costs. \nDo Nothing  You get !!Q payment.  You give up your right to sue \nDefendants on these claims later. \nThese rights and options - and the deadlines to exercise them - are explained in this \nnotice. \nThe Court in charge of this case still must decide whether to give final approval to the \nSettlement.  Likewise, payments to class members will be distributed only if the Court \ngrants final approval of the Settlement and after any appeals are resolved. \nI.  WHY DID I GET THIS NOTICE PACKAGE? \nYou  or  someone  in  your  family  may  have  been  admitted  to  the  Camden  County \nCorrectional Facility on a non-indictable offense, disorderly persons offense, warrant for failure \nto appear, warrant for failure to pay a fine, traffic violation, violation of probation or parole, or \non a family or civil court warrant from April 8, 2003 to April 27, 2005 and been subject to a strip \nsearch. \nThe Court sent you this notice because you have the  right to know about a proposed \nsettlement of a class action lawsuit, and about your options, before the Court decides whether to \napprove the settlement.  If the Court approves it and after objections and appeals are resolved, an \nadministrator  appointed  by  the  Court will  make the  monetary  payments that the  settlement \nallows.  You will be informed of the progress of the settlement.  You should understand that the \nprocess of Court approval may take a good deal of time. \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are \navailable, who is eligible for them and how to get them. \nThe Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the District of New \nJersey, Camden Vicinage, United States District Judge Joseph Rodriguez presiding.  The case is \ncalled Hicks v.  County of Camden, Index No. 05-CV-1857 (JHR).  The people who sued are \ncalled Plaintiffs, and the municipality and municipal officials they sued, the County of Camden, \nits correctional employees and elected officials, are called the Defendants. \n\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 17 of 38\nII. WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT? \nPlaintiffs  claim  in  this  lawsuit  that  the  County  of Camden  illegally  strip  searched \nindividuals admitted to the Camden County Correctional Facility who were charged with non \nindictable crimes or other minor offenses. in violation of the unreasonable search provisions of \nthe United States Constitution. Defendants deny that they did anything wrong, and contend that \neven if they did do anything wrong, Plaintiffs are not entitled to any money as a result of being \nsearched. \nIII. WHY IS THIS A CLASS ACTION? \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case Laverne \nHicks and Michael Velez) sue on behalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of these \npeople are a Class or Class Members.  A class action resolves the issues for all Class Members, \nexcept for those who exclude themselves from the Class.  United States District Judge Joseph H. \nRodriguez is in charge of this class action. \nIV. WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendants.  Instead, both sides agreed \nto a settlement.  That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people affected will \nget compensation.  The Class Representatives and their attorneys think the settlement is best for \neveryone who are alleged to have been illegally strip searched. \nV.  HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM PART OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nJudge Rodriguez decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:  All \npersons who were admitted into the  Camden County Correctional Facility during the period \nApril 8, 2003, through and including April 27, 2005, after being charged with non-indictable \noffenses, disorderly persons offenses, violations, traffic  infractions, violations of probation or \nparole, held on civil matters or other non-indictable occurrences, and were strip searched upon \ntheir entry into the Correctional Facility in the absence of reasonable suspicion.  Specifically \nexcluded  from  the  class are  Defendants  and  any  and  all  of their respective  affiliates,  legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \nAdditionally, Judge Rodriguez decided to certify a portion of the individuals detailed \nabove  as  a  sub-class.  Specifically,  Judge  Rodriguez  decided  that  everyone  who  fits  this \ndescription is a member of the Sub-Class:  All persons who posted bail on non-indictable or \nother minor offenses during the period of April 8, 2003 through and including April 27, 2005 at \nthe Camden County Satellite Unit, located at the Camden City Police Department, and who were \ndetained by Camden County for over twelve hours after the bail was posted. \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 18 of 38\nThe Settlement does not cover individuals charged with indictable offenses at the time of \ntheir entry into the Camden County Correctional Facility, anyone who entered the Correctional \nFacility after being convicted of (as compared to only being charged with) a crime, or anyone \nwho  entered the  Correctional Facility but was not strip  searched as  part of the  Correctional \nFacility's booking procedure. \nVI.  DO I NEED TO PROVE THAT I WAS STRIP-SEARCHED, AND WHAT DOES \nTHAT MEAN? \nNo, you do not need to prove that you were subjected to such a search.  In filling out the \nClaim  Form,  you  will  affirm,  under penalty  of perjury,  that you  were  strip  searched,  and \nDefendants will accept this affirmation.  Provided that your name is detailed in booking records \nmaintained by Camden County, your affirmation will entitle you to payment.  If your name is not \ncontained in Camden County's records, you may be asked to provide additional documentation \nbefore being allowed to participate in the settlement. \nA strip search occurred when you were ordered to take off some or all of your clothes by \na Camden County employee, with that employee watching you undress.  Some members of the \nClass may also have been forced to bend at the waist or manipulate body parts to allow for a \nvisual inspection.  If you were searched in this manner when you were booked into the facility, \nyou are  a member of the class and entitled to  make a claim.  You will need to  provide an \naffirmation on  the Claim Form confirming that one of these searches was conducted on you \nwhen you entered the Camden County Correctional Facility. \nVII.  HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER THE PRE-ADJUDICATED CRIME FOR WHICH \nI  WAS  CHARGED  UPON  ADMISSION  TO  THE  CAMDEN  COUNTY \nCORRECTIONAL FACILITY QUALIFIES ME FOR INCLUSION IN THE CLASS? \nYou must have been brought to the Camden County Correctional Facility before a judge \nhas sentenced you (pre-adjudication) to be eligible to recover, and the charges must have been \nnon-indictable offenses.  Everyone brought to  the Camden County Correctional Facility pre \nadjudication on non-indictable offenses and was strip searched is eligible under this settlement \nagreement. \nStated another way, persons who were  charged with  \"indictable offenses\" as  defined \nunder  the  New Jersey  Code  when they  were  admitted  to  the  Camden  County  Correctional \nFacility cannot recover.  New Jersey defines an indictable offense as an offense which authorizes \nin excess of six months jail time  if convicted.  Indictable offenses are usually handled by a \nSuperior Court Judge, and require indictment by a grand jury.  Murder, burglary and rape are \nexamples of indictable offenses.  Anyone charged with an indictable offense upon admission to \nthe  Camden County Correctional Facility, even if they were also charged with non-indictable \noffenses  at the same time, is not a member of the class unless they were, on another occasion, \nadmitted  to  the  Camden  County  Correctional  Facility  solely  on  non-indictable  or  violation \ncharges. \n\n- -\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 19 of 38\nExamples of \"non-indictable offenses\" are disorderly persons offenses, traffic offenses, \nand child support warrants. Disorderly persons offenses are non-indictable offenses and are, at \nmost,  subject to  incarceration  in  a  local  Correctional  Facility.  Non-Indictable  offenses  are \nhandled  by  a  Municipal  Court or City,  Town  or  Village  Court judge,  and  do  not  require \nindictment. Shoplifting less than $200.00, Disorderly conduct, and Loitering are examples of \ncharges which are non-indictable offenses, and fall within the class definition. Anyone charged \nwith such a non-indictable offense and upon admission to  the  Camden County Correctional \nFacility was strip searched is a member of the Class. \nThe settlement further allows for individuals to make claims if they were admitted to the \nCamden County Correctional Facility for violating the terms of their probation or parole, or if \nthey were subject to a civil commitment.  Parole is only assessed if an individual has served time \nin  state prison.  If the  individual was charged solely with violating parole or probation (for \ninstance, not honoring their conditions of supervision or violating curfew), they are considered to \nbe a member of the class.  If an individual is charged with violating probation or parole and is at \nthe same time charged with an indictable offense, they are not a member of the class.  A civil \ncommitment is an order from a non-criminal court, usually the Family Court, committing that \nindividual to the Camden County Correctional Facility.  Individuals admitted to  the Camden \nCounty Correctional Facility on a civil commitment, for example, a commitment for failure to \npay child support, are members of the Class. \nFinally, if a person was arrested and brought to the Camden County Correctional Facility \nunder traffic offenses or traffic warrants, failing to pay fines and contempt, pre-adjudication, you \nare eligible under this settlement agreement.  Consequently, if you failed to honor a payment \norder with a municipal court, and were arrested, or failed to appear for a municipal court date \nand arrested, brought to the Camden County Correctional Facility and strip searched, you are \neligible to receive a settlement payment. \nVIII.  HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER OR NOT I QUALIFY AS A MEMBER OF THE \nSUB-CLASS  OF  INDIVIDUALS  WHO  WERE  WRONGFULLY  DETAINED  BY \nCAMDEN COUNTY. \nJust prior to  April  2004, Camden County took  over detaining  individuals  who  were \narrested by the City of Camden Police Department.  The Camden County Satellite Unit, which \ncomprised the former holding cells of the Camden PD, was administered by Camden County \nCorrections Officers.  Individuals arrested by the  Camden PD  would be turned over to  the \ncustody of the Satellite Unit shortly after their arrest. \nMany  individuals would post bail shortly after their arrest, but would continue to  be \ndetained by Camden County and later transported to the Camden County Correctional Facility. \nDetainees were often then held at the Camden County Correctional Facility for several hours \nuntil they were reviewed for outstanding warrants.  The sub-class certified by Judge Rodriguez \naddresses individuals arrested for non-indictable or other minor offenses who were then held for \n\n-\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 20 of 38\ntwelve hours after posting after posting bail.  If you, or someone on your behalf, posted bail at \neither the Camden County Satellite Unit, the Camden County Clerk's Office,  or the Camden \nCounty Correctional Facility, and you were then held for twelve hours or more after posting bail, \nyou  are  eligible  to  receive  an  additional  payment under the  settlement.  You  can mark the \nappropriate box on the claim form to confirm that you were held for more than twelve hours, and \nalso claim your eligibility for the additional payment.  Class Counsel will then verify that you are \neligible to receive this additional payment. \nIX.  I WAS ADMITTED TO THE CAMDEN COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY \nBUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT MY CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE.  HOW CAN I \nFIND  THIS  OUT,  AND  HOW  DO  I  KNOW  IF  THE  CHARGE  WAS  A  NON \nINDICTABLE OFFENSE? \nThere are several ways for potential class members to  determine the nature of their criminal \ncharges.  First, you can review your charging documents, which should reflect both your actual \ncharges and whether the charges were non-indictable offenses.  If you do not have your charging \ndocument and remember the local court where you were prosecuted, the court clerk will be able \nto help you find these documents. \nIf you need additional help determining whether you are a class member, or of you have other \nquestions, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at 1-800-7 41-8907. \nYou can still make a claim if you do not remember your criminal charges if you believe you are \na member of the Class, but you may be asked for additional information. \nX.  I PLED GUILTY TO A CRIME. HOW DOES THIS AFFECT BY RIGHT TO \nPARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nIf you  were  admitted  to  the  Camden  County  Correctional  Facility  solely  on  non \nindictable  or  other minor  charges,  as  defined  above,  you  can  participate  in  the  settlement \nregardless of how you resolved your criminal charges,  including  if you pled guilty to those \ncharges, provided that you were admitted to the Correctional Facility before being sentenced by \na court.  For most class members, this would mean that they were committed to the Camden \nCounty Correctional Facility after they were arraigned before a Judge.  If you were sentenced \nbefore admission to the Correctional Facility, meaning you were committed after pleading guilty \nor being convicted at trial, you are not a class member. \nXI.  WHAT IF I WAS ADMITTED TO THE CAMDEN COUNTY CORRECTIONAL \nFACILITY ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION?  CAN I  STILL PARTICIPATE IN \nTHE SETTLEMENT? \nYes.  Individuals who were admitted to the Camden County Correctional Facility on \nmore than one occasion during the class period can be members of the class and can recover \n\n-\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 21 of 38\nmoney.  They can only recover one payment, however, meaning that you will not be provided \nwith extra payments if you were admitted to the Camden County Correctional Facility more than \none time. \nXII.  I AM STILL NOT SURE IF I AM INCLUDED. \nIf you are still not sure if you are included, you can ask for help.  You can call 1-800-\n741-8907 and the settlement administrator or class counsel may help answer your questions.  For \nmore  information, you can also visit the website, www.camdencountystripsearch.com, or you \ncan just fill  out the  Claim Form and return  it to the  Settlement Administrator to see  if you \nqualify. \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS- WHAT YOU GET \nXIII.

Class counsel anticipates, based on claims rates \nfrom  other settlements, that all  individuals who make a claim on the  settlement will receive \nbetween $750.00 and $1,250.00 as a settlement payment.  These amounts are dependent on how \nmany claims are received by the Claims Administrator during the claims period, and are subject \nto change based the number of claims received.

Everyone who sends in  a claim form  will  be  informed of the  progress of the \nsettlement.  Please be patient. \nXVII.  WHAT AM I GIVING UP TO GET A PAYMENT OR STAY IN THE CLASS? \nUnless you exclude yourself, you are staying in the Class, and that means you can't sue, \ncontinue to sue, or be part of any other lawsuit against Camden County, its employees, or its \nelected officials about the legal issues in this case.  It also means that all the Court's orders will \napply to you and legally bind you.  If you sign the claim form, you will agree to release all \nclaims that you have relating to having been strip searched. \nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT \nIf you do not want a payment from this settlement, but you want to keep the right to sue or \ncontinue to sue Camden County on your own about the legal issues in this case, then you must \ntake steps to preserve these rights.  This is called excluding yourself- or is sometimes referred to \nas \"opting out\" of the Settlement Class. \nXVIII.  HOW DO I GET OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nTo exclude yourself from the settlement, you must send a letter by mail saying that you want to \nbe excluded from Hicks v. County of Camden.  Be sure to include your name, address, telephone \nnumber and your signature.  You must mail your exclusion request postmarked no  later than \n[insert date] to Hicks v.

IF I DO NOT EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I SUE CAMDEN COUNTY FOR \nTHE SAME TIDNG LATER? \nNo.  Unless you exclude yourself, you give up the right to sue Camden County for the \nclaims that this settlement involves.  If you have a pending lawsuit, speak to your lawyer in that \nlawsuit immediately.  You must exclude yourself from this class action to continue your own \nlawsuit.  Remember, the exclusion deadline is (insert date]. \nXX.  IF I EXCLUDE MYSELF, CAN I GET MONEY FROM THE SETTLEMENT? \nNo.  If you exclude yourself, do not send in a claim form to ask for money.  But, you may \nsue, continue to sue, or be part of a different lawsuit against Camden County. \nTHE LAW  YERS AND INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING YOU \nXXI.  DO I HAVE A LAWYER IN THIS CASE? \nThe Court approved the Seth R. Lesser of  Locks Law Firm, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, \nWilliam Riback, Esquire, Camden, New Jersey, Charles Laduca of Cuneo, Gilbert &  LaDuca, \nWashington,  District  of Columbia,  and  the  Law  Offices  of Elmer  Robert  Keach,  III,  PC, \nAmsterdam, New York, to represent you and other Class Members.  Together, the lawyers are \ncalled Class Counsel.  You will not be charged for these lawyers.  If you want to be represented \nby your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense. \nXXII.  HOW  WILL  THE  LAWYERS  AND  THE  CLASS  REPRESENTATIVES  BE \nPAID? \nClass Counsel will ask the Court for attorneys' fees and expenses as a percentage of the \n$7,500,000 settlement, and payments of$15,000.00 for Class Representatives Laverne Hicks and \nMichael Velez.  The Settlement Agreement provides that twenty-seven and one-half percent of \nthe settlement fund will be paid to class counsel as an award of attorneys' fees, together with an \naward for the reimbursement of expenses.  These amounts will be deducted from the settlement \nfund before payments are made to Class Members.  The costs of administering the settlement \nwill also be deducted from the settlement fund. \nOBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT \nYou can tell the Court that you do not agree with the settlement or some part of it. \n\n- -\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 24 of 38\nXXIII.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBJECTING AND EXCLUDING \nMYSELF? \nObjecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like something about the settlement. \nYou can object only if you stay in the Class.  Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you do \nnot want to be a part of the class.  If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because \nthe case no longer legally affects you. \nTHE COURT'S FAIRNESS HEARING \nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement.  You may \nattend and you may ask to speak, but you do not have to do so. \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01857-JHR-JS     Document 52-7      Filed 09/05/2007     Page 25 of 38\nXXV.

But you are \nwelcome to come at your own expense.  If you send an objection, you do not have to come to \nCourt to talk about it.
