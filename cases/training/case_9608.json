    "summary": "<p>On December 2, 2002, nine female plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, filed this 42 U.S.C §1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  The plaintiffs challenged the practice of the U.S. Marshal's Service and the District of Columbia of conducting blanket strip, visual body cavity, and/or squat searches (\"strip searches\") of female arrestees that were being held in the Superior Court Cell Block of the D.C. Superior Court while awaiting presentment before a judicial officer.  Specifically, the plaintiffs complained that the policy and practice of subjecting all female arrestees to strip searches in the absence of reasonable individualized suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment.  The plaintiffs further complained that the practice of subjecting female arrestees but not similarly situated male arrestees to blanket strip searches violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.  The class action complaint was amended twice in 2006.</p><p>Defendants denied all allegations and, on May 31, 2006, sought dismissal of the case on numerous grounds, including the defense of qualified immunity.  On November 14, 2006, the District Court (Judge Rosemary M. Collyer) denied Defendants' motion to dismiss in its entirety.  Johnson v. District of Columbia, 461 F.Supp.2d 48 (D.D.C. 2006).  Defendants initially appealed, but the appeal was subsequently voluntarily dismissed.  Johnson v. Government of District of Columbia, 2007 WL 1760078 (D.C.Cir. Jun 11, 2007).</p><p>On February 8, 2008, the District Court granted the plaintiff's motions for class certification. The Court designated two groups of classes, the Fifth Amendment Class and the Fourth Amendment Class. </p><p>The court defined the Fourth Amendment Class as, \"Each woman who, during the Class Period (December 2, 1999, until April 25, 2003), was, (i) held in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) awaiting presentment under a statute of the District of Columbia; (iii) subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search; (iv) under similar circumstances for which male arrestees were not subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search.\"</p><p>The court defined the Fifth Amendment Class as, \"each woman who, during the Class Period (December 2, 1999, until April 25, 2003), was, (i) held in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) awaiting presentment under a statute of the District of Columbia on either (a) a non-drug, non-violent traffic offense, (b) a non-drug, non- violent misdemeanor, or (c) a non-drug, non-violent felony; and (iii) subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search; (iv) without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband.\" </p><p>In this opinion, the District Court also dismissed all charges against the United States Marshall's Service. </p><p>On February 28, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a cross-claim against United States Superior Court Marshall Todd Dillard on the grounds that he caused them (separately and concurrently) to be subjected strip searches at the D.C. Superior Court cellblock in violation of the 4th and 5th amendments. And that by instituting and implementing a policy which subjected the plaintiffs, all women, to strip searches without individualized suspicion, the co-defendant is liable to the District for all, or part of the claims asserted by the plaintiff against the District of Columbia in this action, by virtue of his practice and policy. This crossclaim was partially in response to the District Court having previously dismissed the plaintiff's claims against the United States Marshall's Service.</p><p>On May 23, 2008, the District of Columbia filed for summary judgment for the charges against the District of Columbia. The District Court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on October 31, 2008. The Court found that the District of Columbia cannot be liable to the plaintiffs as a matter of law on any of the theories they advance inasmuch as the Marshal was a federal official and not an employee, servant, agent or actor under the control of the District of Columbia, and inasmuch as the District of Columbia had no choice but to turn over arrestees to the Superior Court Marshal for presentment. This dismissal left the Marshall (Todd Dillard) as the sole defendant in this case.</p><p>On January 14, 2010, the District Court denied the plaintiff's motion to amend their complaint for the third time.</p><p>On April 5, 2010, the defendant filed for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' remaining claims against the Marshall.</p><p>On April 21, 2011, the District Court issued an opinion that granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Court conceded that the record shows that during the class period female arrestees were subjected to a blanket practice of strip searches while many, if not most, male arrestees were not. It is nonetheless clear that former Marshal Dillard is entitled to qualified immunity from the Fourth Amendment claims. The Fifth Amendment claims similarly fail as the plaintiffs proffered no evidence that former Marshal Dillard purposefully discriminated by intending a gender disparity in search procedures. Summary judgment was denied to the plaintiffs on their Fourth Amendment claims and granted to Marshal Dillard on the Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims. Accordingly the case was dismissed from District Court. </p><p>On May 4, 2011, the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the DC Circuit Court. </p><p>On August 13, 2014 the DC Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the District Court's summary judgment ruling for Superior Court Marshal, finding him entitled to qualified immunity. And also affirming the District Court's summary judgment ruling for the District of Columbia, concluding that because the Superior Court Marshal in charge of the cellblock was at all times a federal official acting under color of federal law, the city had no authority to prevent the strip searches.</p>",

Discovery has\nbeen long and torturous to identify the alleged class members, to investigate the scope of the alleged\npractices, and to determine which, if any, Defendants might be potentially liable.  The USMS was\ndismissed as a Defendant by Memorandum Opinion and Order of this Court on February 8, 2008.\nSee Dkt. ## 158 & 159.  The District of Columbia was dismissed as a Defendant by Memorandum\nOpinion and Order of this Court on October 31, 2008.  See Dkt ## 202 & 203.  The sole remaining\nDefendant is former Superior Court Marshal Todd Dillard.\nOn November 19, 2009, just as discovery was (finally) ending, Plaintiffs filed a\nMotion for Leave to File a Third Amended Complaint.  See Dkt. # 216.  The proposed Third\nAmended Complaint seeks again to bring the USMS and the District of Columbia into the litigation\nas Defendants.  The District of Columbia has filed a motion to intervene to oppose Plaintiffs’\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 223   Filed 01/11/10   Page 2 of 2\nmotion.  See Dkt. # 222.\nMarshal Dillard has filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion, see Dkt. # 219, and the\nCourt merely awaits Plaintiffs’ reply before ruling.  That reply is due on January 11, 2010.  See\nMinute Order dated December 30, 2009.1  Inasmuch as the District of Columbia has indicated that\nit will not be able to file its opposition any earlier than January 13, 2010, see Mot. to Intervene ¶ 5,\nthe Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE [Dkt. # 222] the District of Columbia’s motion to\nintervene.  If, after Plaintiffs file their reply, the Court determines that further briefing from the\nDistrict of Columbia would assist it in ruling on Plaintiffs’ motion, the Court will permit the District\nof Columbia to intervene for the purpose of filing an opposition. \nSO ORDERED.\nDate: January 11, 2010                      /s/                                                     \nROSEMARY M.

Plaintiffs are persons who were arrested in the District of Columbia and who were \ntaken to the Superior Court for presentment on District of Columbia warrants or code \noffenses and who were subjected to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat \nsearches (hereafter generically referred to as “strip searches”) while being held in the \nSuperior Court Cell Block of the District of Columbia Superior Court, waiting for \npresentment before a judge or other judicial officer of the District of Columbia Superior \nCourt.   \n2.  Every person held in the Superior Court Cell Block pending presentment on a \ncode offense or a District of Columbia arrest warrant is held in the joint custody of the \nUnited States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia (hereafter \n“Superior Court Marshal”) and the Government of the District of Columbia. \n3.  Todd Dillard was appointed as the United States Marshal for the Superior Court of \nthe District of Columbia in October 1995 and he held the office until at least January, \n2005. \n4.  Plaintiffs primarily allege that, in about 1995, Todd Dillard implemented a \npractice of having his deputies subject all female arrestees (but not similarly situated \n  3 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 4 of 75\nmale arrestees) taken to the Superior Court for presentment to blanket strip searches \n(defined below) and the practice lasted during the Class Period. (“Class period” is \ndefined below.)  On the basis of these allegations plaintiffs assert two class action claims, \na claim based on the Fourth Amendment (“Primary Fourth Amendment Class”) on behalf \nof all female arrestees arrested on charges not involving weapons, drugs, or felony \nviolence taken to the Superior Court for presentment during the Class Period and a claim \nbased on the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment (“Fifth Amendment  \nClass”) on behalf of all female arrestees (regardless of charge) taken to the Superior \nCourt for presentment during the Class Period. \n5.  In the alternative, plaintiffs allege that, prior to the beginning of the Class Period \nTodd Dillard implemented a practice of having his deputies subject all male arrestees as \nwell as female arrestees (rather than just female arrestees) to blanket strip searches so that \nfrom that point onward his deputies subjected all arrestees (male as well as female \narrestees) to blanket strip searches.  On the basis of these allegations plaintiffs assert a \nclass action claim based on the Fourth Amendment (“Alternative Fourth Amendment \nClass”) on behalf of all arrestees (male and female) arrested on charges not involving \nweapons, drugs, or felony violence taken to the Superior Court for presentment during  \n  4 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 5 of 75\n1\nthe Class Period.  \n6.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs (Dianna Johnson, Rubbiya \nMuhammad, Carolyn Montgomery, Tonya Cecelia Mack and Laura Lambert) bring this \naction on behalf of the Primary Fourth Amendment Class against the Government of the \nDistrict of Columbia (hereinafter the District of Columbia or the District) and Todd \nDillard in his individual and official capacity pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce their Fourth Amendment Rights.  Additionally, \nthe Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action against Todd Dillard, in his \nindividual and official capacity, directly under the Fourth Amendment to the \nConstitution.  The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action against the \nUnited States Marshals Service for injunctive relief only directly under the Fourth \nAmendment to the Constitution. \n                     \n1 Plaintiffs plead the alternative Fourth Amendment claim and the allegations about strip \nsearches of male arrestees in support of it because this is former Marshal Todd Dillard’s \nlitigating position in this case even though his position is contrary to sworn deposition \ntestimony and interrogatory responses provided by his staff in previous, similar cases. \nSee paragraphs 160 et seq. below.  Female deputies testified in depositions in several \nprevious lawsuits (e.g. Helton v. United States, 01-385 (JDB)) filed on February 21, 2001 \nin this Court that in about 1995 Todd Dillard implemented a practice of subjecting female \nbut not male arrestees to blanket strip searches upon arrival at the Superior Court.  \nInterrogatory responses filed in Helton based on information provided by Mark Shealey, \nSupervisory Deputy United States Marshal, Supervisor of the Superior Court Cell Block, \nand others, and signed by Diane Sullivan, AUSA, stated that the then prevailing practice \nat Superior Court was that male deputies subjected every male arrestees received by Todd \nDillard’s deputies at Superior Court to the blanket pat down and “in-custody” searches \ndescribed herein, and that if “something suspicious” occurred male arrestees were set \naside for “a more thorough search.”  Nonetheless, former Superior Court Marshal Todd \nDillard’s position in this case, as far as plaintiffs can understand it, is that he had the \nsame strip search policy for male as well as female arrestees. Id.  \n  5 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 6 of 75\n7.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs (Dianna Johnson, Rubbiya Muhammad, \nCarolyn Montgomery, Tonya Cecelia Mack, Laura Lambert, Dianne Wilkes, Vickie \nBrooks, Keisha Holloway and Donna Curtis) bring this action against the Government of \nthe District of Columbia and Todd Dillard in his individual and official capacity pursuant \nto Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce their Fifth \nAmendment Rights.  Additionally, the Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this \naction against Todd Dillard, in his individual and official capacity, directly under the \nFifth Amendment to the Constitution.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this \naction against the United States Marshals Service solely for injunctive relief directly \nunder the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. \n8.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs (Dianna Johnson, Rubbiya \nMuhammad, Carolyn Montgomery, Tonya Cecelia Mack and Laura Lambert) bring this \naction on behalf of the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class against the Government of \nthe District of Columbia and Todd Dillard in his individual and official capacity pursuant \nto Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce their \nFourth Amendment Rights.  Additionally, the Alternative Fourth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs bring this action against Todd Dillard, in his individual and official capacity, \ndirectly under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.  The Alternative Fourth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action against the United States Marshals \nService for injunctive relief only directly under the Fourth Amendment to the \nConstitution. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 7 of 75\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 \nU.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) because plaintiffs’ claims are based on Section 1983 and the \nConstitution. \n10.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  The claim for relief arose in this judicial \ndistrict. \nDEFINITIONS \n11.  A “blanket” strip search means a strip search undertaken without making an \nindividualized or categorical determination that reasonable suspicion exists to justify the \nsearch.  \n12.  Since at least January 1999 through the present many arrestees arrested on felony \ncharges had their charges “papered down” to a misdemeanor before presentment. \n13.  As used herein, “presentment” refers to the initial proceeding before the Court \nreferred to in Rule 5 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. \n14.  Violent offense means any of the offenses defined as a “crime of violence” in D.C. \nCode § 23-1331(4) as defined under Title 22 of the D.C. Code, misdemeanor simple \nassault, D.C. Code § 22-404 and misdemeanor threats, D.C. Code § 22-407. \n15.  Drug offense means any offense under District of Columbia law that has as an \nelement, the possession, possession with intent to distribute, or the distribution of, any \n  7 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 8 of 75\nsubstance referred to in D.C. Code § 48-901.02, or any item defined as drug \nparaphernalia by D.C. Code § 48-1101(3). \n16.  Traffic and District of Columbia offenses mean any offense prosecuted by the \nCorporation Counsel’s Office of the District of Columbia.   \n17.  Superior Court Cell Block as used herein includes the hallway leading to the \nSuperior Court Cell Block and any place in the Superior Court where the searches \ndescribed herein actually occurred. \n18.  The United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia has \ndeputies and detention enforcement officers and other persons under his command to \nhelp him in his duties at the Superior Court.  Such persons are referred to herein as \n“deputies.” \n19.  As used herein “arrestees” includes both male and female arrestees unless \notherwise indicated. \n20.  As used herein “Class Period” refers to the Class Period for purposes of the \ndamages claims herein, and means from December 2, 1999, until the date the strip search \npolicies and practices complained of herein were terminated (which the federal \ndefendants have represented happened in April 2003 but which Plaintiffs have not yet \nindependently verified), or until this case is terminated, whichever is earlier).  The phrase \n“Class Period” applies to both the Primary Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment \nClasses and to the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class, as the relevant period for each \n  8 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 9 of 75\nis, according to the Defendants, the same. If it turns out that the Class Period for the \nPrimary Fourth Amendment Class and the Fifth Amendment Class differs from the Class \nPeriod for the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class, then the phrase “Class Period” as \nused up to and including ¶ 240 refers to the period from December 2, 1999, until the strip \nsearch policies and practices complained of herein were terminated as to female arrestees, \nand the phrase “Class Period” as used from ¶ 241 onward refers to the period from \nDecember 2, 1999, until the strip search policies and practices complained of herein were \nterminated as to both female and male arrestees.  \n21.  If Plaintiffs are referring specifically to the Class Period for purposes of the \ninjunctive relief claims herein, the phrase “Injunctive Relief Class Period” will be used, \nwhich refers to the period December 2, 1999 until the present and into the future unless \nthe Court acts to enjoin the unlawful activity complained of herein.  \nPARTIES-PLAINTIFFS \n22.

Defendant Government of the District of Columbia is a municipal corporation \ncapable of being sued under D.C. Code § 1-102. \n62.  Defendant Todd Dillard was the United States Marshal for the Superior Court of \nthe District of Columbia from October 1990 until at least January 2005.  Todd Dillard is \nsued in his individual and official capacity. \n63.  Defendant United States Marshals Service is an agency of the federal government \nlocated in Washington, DC.  Defendant United States Marshals Service is sued for \ninjunctive relief only. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL FOR THE SUPERIOR \nCOURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n64.  The District of Columbia is a government constituted body corporate for \nmunicipal purposes capable of suing and being sued. D.C. Code §1-102.  \n65.  The District of Columbia, through the Superior Court, has jurisdiction and legal \ncustody over arrestees brought to the Superior Court for presentment. \n66.  The Superior Court of the District of Columbia is an agency of the Government of \nthe District of Columbia. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 17 of 75\n67.  The District of Columbia, through the Superior Court, has custody over arrestees \nbecause of Superior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 5 (“D.C. SCR-Crim. Rule \n5”). \n68.  Rule 5 obligates any “officer within the District of Columbia making an arrest \nunder a warrant issued by the Superior Court upon a complaint, making an arrest without \na warrant, or receiving a person arrested by a special policeman or other authorized \nperson” to take the arrested person before the Superior Court. D.C. SCR-Crim. \n69.  Rule 5 also authorizes the Superior Court to hold presentments, and to make \nprobable cause determinations and decisions affecting release or detention. \n70.  The judicial officers of the Superior Court have power to release or detain \narrestees pending trial, pursuant to D.C. Code §23-1321. \n71.  Thus, while the arrestees are at the Superior Court for presentment, the statutory \nauthority over arrestees is authority granted by District of Columbia statutes to the judges \nof the Superior Court. \n72.  Every person held in the Superior Court pending presentment is held in the joint \ncustody of the United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia \n(formerly Todd Dillard) and the Government of the District of Columbia. \n73.  The Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Superior Court (hereafter “Chief \nJudge”) administratively controls the disposition of the space at the District of Columbia \nSuperior Court, including areas where arrestees and other prisoners are held.   \n  17 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 18 of 75\n74.  For example, by Superior Court Administrative Order 02-14, the Chief Judge \nauthorized the MPD to use Cellblock B as a booking center the day of the IMF protests in \n2002. \n75.  On information and belief, Defendant District of Columbia pays every year for \nsome or all of the costs of operation, maintenance and repair of space used by the United \nStates Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia at the District of \nColumbia Superior Court Courthouse.  \n76.  On information and belief, Defendant District of Columbia pays every year for \nsome or all of the costs incurred by the United States Marshal for the Superior Court of \nthe District of Columbia and his deputies in performing their duties at the District of \nColumbia Superior Court Courthouse. \n77.  The District of Columbia through the Chief Judge also administratively controls \nthe prisoners (including arrestees) in the Superior Court courthouse.  \n78.  The District of Columbia has the authority to direct the United States Marshal for \nthe Superior Court of the District of Columbia with respect to his treatment of arrestees at \nthe Superior Court. D.C. Code § 11-1729. \n79.  The Chief Judge in 2002 issued an administrative order ordering deputies not to \nremove in-custody defendants from the Superior Court courtrooms until after the judges \nand courtroom staff had completed appropriate paperwork, and further ordering said \ndeputies not to return in-custody defendants to the DC Jail unless the deputies had all the \n  18 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 19 of 75\npaperwork in all of in-custody defendant’s cases.  Chief Judge’s Administrative Order \n02-22, dated July 25, 2002. \n80.  The Superior Court Marshal and his deputies act as agents of the Defendant \nDistrict of Columbia pursuant to District of Columbia statutes, policies and/or practices \nwhile holding arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block and other areas of the Superior \nCourt Courthouse. \nARRESTEES: FROM ARREST TO PRESENTMENT \n81.  Upon arrest, persons arrested in the District of Columbia on District of Columbia \nwarrants or DC Code offenses are held at one of the seven District “stations” before \ntransport to Central Cellblock (the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police lock-up for \nholding arrestees) or are taken directly to Central Cellblock. \n82.  The arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block have been subjected to pat down \nsearches by the arresting MPD officers and by the processing officers at the stations \nbefore being transported to the Superior Court Cell Block by the MPD. \n83.  Arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block arrested on suspicion of offenses \ninvolving drugs in many cases have been subjected to searches by the arresting MPD \nofficers in which the officers search inside the person’s pants and underwear before being \ntransported to the Superior Court Cell Block by the MPD. \n  19 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 20 of 75\n84.  The arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block have been subjected to pat down \nsearches by the transporting MPD officers before being transported to the Superior Court \nCell Block by the MPD. \n85.  Any arrestee who is transported to the Superior Court Cell Block from any of the \nseven District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department patrol districts or the District \nof Columbia Metropolitan Police Department’s Central Cell Block has been subjected to \na thorough pat down at the patrol station or the MPD Central Cell Block before being \ntransported to Superior Court Cell Block. \n86.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the MPD \nhad a policy and practice predating 1999 of subjecting male and female arrestees held in \nCentral Cell Block to strip searches upon reasonable suspicion that the arrestee was \ncarrying drugs, weapons or other contraband before transporting them to the Superior \nCourt courthouse. \n87.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, MPD \nofficers transported the arrestees from the District stations or the MPD Central Cellblock \nby van to the Superior Court.  \n88.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, each \narrestee also wore “flex cuffs,” that is, plastic hand cuffs while on the van. \n89.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, each van \nload of arrestees transported to Superior Court by the MPD had a “van sheet,” that is, a \n  20 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 21 of 75\nmanifest that lists the name, PDID number, lock-up number (every person presented in \nSuperior Court has a “lock-up” number), date of birth and arrest charge(s) of each \npassenger on the van. \n90.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, each \narrestee arriving from the MPD wore a plastic wrist band that has his/her name, PDID \nnumber and photograph on it.  \n91.  Thus, deputies receiving arrestees from MPD officers could and did read an \narrestee’s charge at a glance.  \n92.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, as arrestees \nstepped off the van and entered the Superior Court courthouse, they went up in an \nelevator, stepped off the elevator in a cell area, and deputies cut off the flex cuffs, and \nthen the arrestees walked through a metal detector.   \n93.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, as the \narrestees walked past the metal detector, one deputy would read out each name on the \nvan sheet and the number next to it, while another deputy would locate that arrestee and \nwrite that number, the “lock up” number, on that arrestee’s wrist band if he/she had a US \ncharge, or, if the person had a DC charge, the deputy wrote a letter on the wrist band \ndesignating the type of charge, as explained in the following paragraph.   \n94.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the deputies \nmarked, in black marker, the level of the charge on the wrist band each arrestee had been \n  21 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 22 of 75\nissued by the MPD (“D” for District charge, “T” for traffic charge, “V” for domestic \nviolence, “M” for misdemeanor and “F” for felony).  \n95.  Any deputy who wrote, or saw, a “T” or a “D” on a wrist band would or should \nknow that the arrestee is charged with a District of Columbia offense. \n96.  District of Columbia offenses are mostly minor offenses such as failure to obey, \ndisorderly conduct, urinating in public. \n97.  Traffic offenses involve operation of a motor vehicle including speeding, reckless \ndriving, driving without a license and DUI. \n98.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the \nsearching deputies could have looked at the van sheets or the wrist bands to make \nindividualized determinations of the need for searches based on the nature of the charge, \nbut they did not. \n99.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the deputies \nthen subjected the arrestees to very thorough pat-down searches in which the deputies \nchecked the arrestees’ hair, wig, hairpiece or hat, and removed and inspected their coats \nand shoes.   \n100.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the deputies \nalso searched arrestees’ waistband areas, pockets, leg areas, and feet.  \n  22 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 23 of 75\n101.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the deputies \nalso made the arrestees take off their shoes and socks, shake out their shoes, and deputies \nsearched the shoes and socks. \n102.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the deputies \nalso made arrestees vigorously brush their hair to dislodge contraband, or a deputy ran his \nfingers or an object such as a pencil through their hair. \n103.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, a deputy \nthen inspected behind the ears and in the arrestees’ ears, and looked inside their nostrils \nand mouths, including under the tongue and between the lips and gums. \n104.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, deputies \nalso conducted a thorough pat-down of the arrestees’ bodies, including the crotch and \nother areas. \n105.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, at this point \nin the process, male and female arrestees were led to separate areas segregated by gender. \n106.  However plaintiffs do not allege that male deputies searched female arrestees or \nvice versa, or that members of an opposite gender were allowed to see strip searches. \n107.  The great majority of arrestees during the Class Period, including the Injunctive \nRelief Class Period, were released from custody after presentment in the presentment \ncourtroom, either because their cases were no-papered, or because they were released on \npersonal recognizance. \n  23 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 24 of 75\n108.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, twenty-five \npercent to 35% of arrestees’ cases were “no-papered”; i.e., their cases were dismissed \nfrom the courtroom because the prosecuting agency rejected the charges completely. \n109.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, many \npersons arrested on felony charges had their charges “papered down” to a misdemeanor \nbefore presentment. \n110.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the \nsearching deputies knew at the time of the searches that some of the cases would be no-\npapered. \n111.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, arrestees \nheld at the Superior Court awaiting presentment there were quarantined from other \npersons held at the Superior Court in segregated holding cells. \n112.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, other \nprisoners at the Superior Court Courthouse, including arrestees denied bail at \npresentment and ordered held at the DC Jail or some other place, and detainees held \npending trial brought in for court events or “stepped-back” at court hearings, were not \nintermingled with pre-presentment arrestees in the courthouse or during transport prior to \npresentment. \n113.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, arrestees \nwere quarantined by sex in their own cells. \n  24 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 25 of 75\n114.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, there was no \n“general population” at the Superior Court Cell Block. \n115.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, no prisoner \nor arrestee stayed overnight at the Superior Court Cell Block. \n116.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, prisoners, \nincluding arrestees, were bussed into the Superior Court Cell Block in the morning and \nleft that same day whether by release at the courthouse or by transport out to another \nfacility.  \n117.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, arrestees \nwere brought to the Superior Court the day of presentment in their cases and were either \nreleased directly from the courtroom or transported that day to another facility. \n118.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the only \npersons housed in the Superior Court Cell Block designated for arrestees were arrestees \nbrought to the Superior Court Courthouse for presentment to a judicial officer of the \nDistrict of Columbia who had not yet been presented. \n119.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, arrestees did \nnot even receive meals or beverages at the Superior Court. \n120.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, at \npresentment, a judge of the Superior Court ordered a person released or held pending \ntrial.   \n  25 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 26 of 75\n121.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, arrestees \nordered released at presentment left from the courtroom and picked up their property \nfrom the police facility where they were processed.   \n122.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, arrestees \nordered held at presentment were taken from the courtroom by deputies and removed \nfrom the courthouse by deputies or handed off to custody of the detaining authority.   \n123.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, persons \narrested on bench warrants were taken by the deputies to another courtroom (e.g., the \ncourtroom of the judge who issued the bench warrant).   \n124.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, such \narrestees remaining in custody after presentment were not intermingled with arrestees \nawaiting presentment. \n125.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, arrestees \nbrought to the Superior Court Courthouse were segregated by sex, and the males and \nfemales arrestees are held separately in separate areas in the Superior Court Cell Block. \nSTRIP SEARCH PRACTICES APPLICABLE TO FEMALE ARRESTEES ONLY \n126.  Sometime in 1995 Todd Dillard implemented a practice or policy of having \nfemale deputies subject all female arrestees to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or \nsquat searches without a particularized finding of reasonable suspicion that the female \narrestees are in possession of weapons, drugs or other contraband. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 27 of 75\n127.  This practice of having female deputies subject all female arrestees to blanket \nstrip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches without a particularized finding of \nreasonable suspicion that the female arrestees were in possession of weapons, drugs or \nother contraband violated the United States Marshals’ Service strip search policy in force \nagency-wide during the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period. \n128.  The United States Marshals’ Service strip search policy, memorialized in writing \nand in force agency-wide during the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class \nPeriod, required that all strip searches be based on an individualized finding of \nreasonable suspicion that the person to be searched was secreting drugs or other \ncontraband.  A copy is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. \n129.  Todd Dillard’s deputies actually physically conducted the visual body cavity and \nsquat searches of the female arrestees at his direction in a hallway on the way to the \nSuperior Court Cell Block or in the Superior Court Cell Block. \n130.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, deputies \nsubjected every single female arrestee to the strip searches described herein without \nexception and regardless of charge or arrest history. \n131.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, Todd \nDillard’s deputies instructed deputies newly assigned to the Superior Court to conduct the \nblanket strip searches on all women as part of the new deputies’ two day training \nprogram. \n  27 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 28 of 75\n132.  During the Class Period, after the thorough pat down searches and the “in-\ncustody” searches female deputies then took the female arrestees to the cell block area \ndesignated for female arrestees and subjected them to blanket strip, visual body cavity \nand/or squat searches in the hallway leading to the Superior Court Cell Block or in the \nCell Block or in the door way of the Cell Block itself. \n133.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, a female \ndeputy directed the female arrestees to pull up their skirts or lower their pants, and pull \ndown any undergarments. \n134.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, a female \ndeputy then made the female arrestees squat, turn around, and display their buttocks and \ngenitals to the female deputy. \n135.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the female \ndeputies stood just a few feet away from the female arrestees as they performed the strip \nsearches and made a point of observing the female’s genitalia and anus areas.  \n136.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the female \ndeputies did not place mirrors underneath the female arrestees as they squatted.  \n137.  Forcing a woman to squat is not an effective method of making contraband hidden \nin her vagina visible. \n  28 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 29 of 75\n138.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, female \ndeputies then put the female arrestees in a holding cell designated for new female lock \nups measuring about 30 to 50 feet. \n139.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the female \ndeputies conducted the strip searches of newly arrived female arrestees in front of all \nfemale arrestees already in the hallway leading from the reception area to the Superior \nCourt Cell Block, or in the Cell Block.  \n140.  One female arrestee subjected to the strip search in about 2002 described it as \nfollows: \nWe four women then walked into the cell one by one in single file.  The \nlead woman walked towards the back of the cell where a toilet was, \nfacing the back of the cell, and pulled her pants and underwear down, \nand crouched down in a half squat, displaying her buttocks to the female \nMarshal.  The female Marshal told the second girl in line, “Face the \nwall.”  Then the second and third woman also walked towards the back \nof the cell where the toilet was, facing the back of the cell, and pulled \ntheir pants and underwear down, and crouched down in a half squat, \ndisplaying their buttocks to the female Marshal.  The female Marshal \nwas screaming, “Keep moving, ladies.”  The other inmates were telling \nme I had to strip too.  “This is what you have to do when you get here”, \nthey said.  I turned to the female Marshal, and asked the female \nMarshal, “I don’t have to do that, do I”?  She screamed several times at \nme, “Keep moving, I don’t have all day.”  Then she barked at me, “Go \nto the end and do it.”  Then I walked to the back to the wall, turned \naround, pulled down my pants, and then I pulled down my underwear.  \nIt seemed like an eternity.  All the other inmates applauded. \n \n141.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, after the \ndeputies had completed processing and strip searching female arrestees as described \n  29 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 30 of 75\nherein, but before they presented female arrestees in the presentment courtrooms, they \nallowed female arrestees to have unsupervised contact visits with their attorneys in \nconference cells. \n142.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the \nattorneys and the female arrestees in the conference cells were separated only by grills \nthat have 4 inch by 12 inch slots in the grill-work for items and paperwork to be passed \nthrough. \n143.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, no female \narrestees were subjected to strip searches after the contact visits even though female \narrestees were subjected to strip searches described herein before the contact visits. \n144.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the contact \nvisits with attorneys were not the justification for any of the searches of female arrestees \ndescribed herein. \n145.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period,, agents of \nthe District of Columbia such as police and pretrial services employees and CJA Office \nemployees conducting financial eligibility interviews regularly mingled at the Superior \nCourt courthouse with the Superior Court Marshals and arrestees, and knew about the \nsearches at all times within the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period,  \n  30 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 31 of 75\n146.  The MPD transport officers mingled with Todd Dillard’s deputies near the sally \nport and were aware of the strip searches of female arrestees during the Class Period \nincluding the Injunctive Relief Class Period. \nDistrict Court Injunctions Applicable to the District of Columbia and to the Female \nArrestees \n147.  In the 1980s and the early 1990s, before instituting its current practice of holding \nfemale arrestees at the District stations or Central Cellblock before bringing them to the \nSuperior Court for presentment, the District followed a practice of committing female \narrestees to the DC Jail and holding them there until they were transported to the Superior \nCourt for presentment. \n148.  At that time (in the 1980s and the early 1990s) the District followed a practice of \nsubjecting all female arrestees committed to the DC Jail awaiting transport to the \ncourthouse for presentment (“police cases”) to visual body cavity strip searches without \nan individual determination of reasonable suspicion that the arrestee was concealing \ncontraband to support the search. \n149.  On July 22, 1981 The Honorable Audrey Robinson of this Court entered on Order \n(“Morgan Order”) which directed, among other things, that the District of Columbia not \nconduct strip or squat searches of female police cases housed at the District of Columbia \nDetention Facility [DC Jail] in the absence of a \"reasonable suspicion that a weapon, \ncontraband or evidence of a crime are concealed on the person or in the clothing of the \n  31 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 32 of 75\narrestee which the District or its agents reasonably believe can only be discovered by a \nstrip or squat search.\"  Morgan v. Barry, 596 F. Supp. 897, 898 (D.D.C. 1984). \n150.  The Honorable Audrey Robinson entered an Order on October 29, 1985 \ncontinuing the Morgan Order (and another order) “for an indefinite period of time”.  \nMorgan v. Barry, 81-cv-1419, Docket Entry No. 82, 1985 (docket sheet).  The orders \nremain in effect. \n151.  The Morgan Order and other orders imposed on the District of Columbia from the \ntime when they were entered obliged the District of Columbia to protect female arrestees \nfrom blanket strip searches before presentment regardless of where the female arrestees \nare held before presentment. \n152.  The Morgan Order and other orders from the time when they were entered \nimposed on the District of Columbia obliged the District of Columbia to ensure that \nanyone to whom the District of Columbia entrusted its female arrestees also protect the \nDistrict’s female arrestees from blanket strip searches before presentment regardless of \nwhere the female arrestees are held before presentment. \n153.  The Morgan Order and other orders from the time when they were entered obliged \nthe District of Columbia to monitor the conduct of persons to whom the District of \nColumbia entrusts its female arrestees to ensure they were protected from blanket strip \nsearches before presentment regardless of where the female arrestees are committed \nbefore presentment. \n  32 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 33 of 75\n154.  The District of Columbia remained and remains obligated under the Morgan Order \nand other orders to ensure that Todd Dillard protect the female arrestees from blanket \nstrip searches while the United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of \nColumbia and his deputies have physical custody of the District’s female arrestees prior \nto presentment. \n155.  The Morgan Order and other orders impose on the  Superior Court Marshal and \nhis deputies a duty to familiarize themselves with laws and orders which protect the \nDistrict’s female arrestees from blanket strip searches before presentment regardless of \nwhere the female arrestees are committed before presentment. \nKNOWLEDGE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OF THE STRIP \nSEARCHES APPLICABLE TO FEMALE ARRESTEES \n156.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, female \narrestees but not similarly situated male arrestees were subjected to blanket searches in \nthe Superior Court Cell Block. The Government of the District of Columbia knew at all \ntimes during the Class Period, or should have known, that female arrestees but not \nsimilarly situated male arrestees were and would be subjected to blanket searches in the \nSuperior Court Cell Block and the Government of the District of Columbia acquiesced in \nthe searches. \n157.  Several related lawsuits filed on February 21, 2001, challenging the United States \nMarshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia’s policy of subjecting all \nfemale arrestees (but not male arrestees) to the blanket strip searches plaintiffs challenged \n  33 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 34 of 75\nherein gave constructive notice to the District that the United States Marshal for the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia was subjecting all female arrestees (but not \nmale arrestees) to blanket strip searches.  E.g. Helton v. United States, 01-385 (JDB).  \n158.  Female deputies testified in depositions in those cases that in about 1995 Todd \nDillard implemented a practice of subjecting female but not male arrestees to blanket \nstrip searches upon arrival that the Superior Court. \n159.  Female deputies testified in depositions in those cases that they were trained in \nthat policy upon their assignment to Superior Court. \n160.  Interrogatory responses filed in Helton based on information provided by Mark \nShealey, Supervisory Deputy United States Marshal, Supervisor of the Superior Court \nCell Block, and others, and signed by Diane Sullivan, AUSA, stated that the then \nprevailing practice at Superior Court was that male deputies subjected every male \narrestees received by Todd Dillard’s deputies at Superior Court to blanket to the pat \ndown and “in-custody” searches described herein, and that if “something suspicious” \noccurred male arrestees were set aside for “a more thorough search.” \n161.  The Government of the District of Columbia knowingly, and as part of its practice, \npolicy, and custom, nonetheless transferred female arrestees in its custody to the custody \nof Todd Dillard (then United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of \nColumbia), causing each member of the Classes to be subjected to the strip searches. \n  34 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 35 of 75\n162.  The District of Columbia delegated its duties to Todd Dillard but failed to train \nTodd Dillard in strip search polices even though the need for training was obvious. \n163.  The constitutional violations that resulted were foreseeable because of the \nDistrict’s failure to train. \nSTEPS DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COULD HAVE TAKEN TO PREVENT \nSTRIP SEARCHES BUT DID NOT \n164.  The District of Columbia could have taken many steps to stop the strip searches of \nthe female arrestees described herein but did not take any steps. \n165.  The District of Columbia could have instructed Todd Dillard to stop the strip \nsearches of the female arrestees described herein but did not. \n166.  The Chief Judge of the District of Columbia could have issued an administrative \norder prohibiting the strip searches  described herein but did not.   \n167.  The Chief Judge of the District of Columbia or the District of Columbia could \nhave ordered other agents of the District of Columbia such as police officers to handle \narrestees at the Superior Court without the strip searches described herein but did not. \n168.  The District of Columbia could have asked the Chief Judge of the District of \nColumbia to issue an administrative order stopping the strip searches of female arrestees \ndescribed herein but did not. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 36 of 75\n169.  The District of Columbia could have brought a lawsuit like this one seeking to \nenjoin the strip searches of female arrestees described herein but did not. \n170.  The District could have joined this lawsuit with respect to the injunctive relief \ncomponent but did not. \n171.  The District of Columbia currently and since at least 1998 had a process for \ndisposing of arrestees’ cases before bringing them to the Superior Court by (for example) \ngranting them bail from a District station or the MPD Central Cell Block, allowing \nrelease on citation or personal recognizance, . \n172.  The District could have instituted a “night” court so that more arrestees arrested on \nminor offenses had their cases disposed of without necessitating a transfer to the custody \nof the United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia at the \nSuperior Court.  \n173.  The District either did or alternatively could have communicated the strip search \npolicies in effect at the MPD Central Cell Block to the United States Marshal for the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia so he could have known which arrestees \ntransported to him by the MPD had already been strip searched. \n174.  The District could have held presentments in the MPD Cell Block or another \nlocation as it has on other occasions. \n175.  The District could have maintained physical custody of the arrestees and presented \nthem to Superior Court judicial officers via video camera. \n  36 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 37 of 75\n176.  The District of Columbia could have taken other steps but it did not. \nPrimary Fourth Amendment Class Action Allegations \n177.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules \n23(a), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class \nconsisting of each woman who, during the Class Period (December 2, 1999, until the date \nthe strip search policies and practices complained of herein were terminated or until this \ncase is terminated, whichever is earlier), was, (i) while being held or just before being put \nin the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) for presentment under a statute of the District of \nColumbia; on either (iii)(a) a non drug, non violent traffic offense; (iii)(b) a non drug, \nnon violent misdemeanor; or (iii)(c) a non drug, non violent felony; (iv) was subjected to \na blanket strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat search without any individualized \nfinding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs, \nweapons or other contraband.  \n178.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules \n23(a), and 23(b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class \nconsisting of each woman who, during the Injunctive Relief Class Period (December 2, \n1999 until the present and into the future unless the Court acts to restrain the unlawful \nactivity complained of herein), was or will be, (i) while being held or just before being \nput in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) for presentment under a statute of the District of \nColumbia; on either (iii)(a) a non drug, non violent traffic offense; (iii)(b) a non drug, \nnon violent misdemeanor; or (iii)(c) a non drug, non violent felony; (iv) was subjected to \n  37 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 38 of 75\na blanket strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat search without any individualized \nfinding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs, \nweapons or other contraband. (This Class is hereafter at times referred to as the Primary \nFourth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class.) \n179.  Certification of a Primary Fourth Amendment class under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate because defendants District of Columbia and Todd \nDillard had policies and engaged in a pattern and practice of conduct that has uniformly \naffected all members of the class, and injunctive relief against Defendants will benefit \neach and every plaintiff and class member. \n180.  The Primary Fourth Amendment class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating \nand prohibiting the resumption of the above described policy of blanket searches not \nbased on individualized or particularized suspicion or cause. \n181.  Certification of a Primary Fourth Amendment class under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(3) is also appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact \npredominate over any individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n182.  Regarding the Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs, and members of the \nPrimary Fourth Amendment class, there are no individual questions on the issue of \nliability, because every woman arrestee held in the Superior Court Cell Block during the \nClass Period was subjected to the blanket strip searches, and none of the defendants \nkeeps records of the searches and therefore none of the defendants can show that any of \n  38 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 39 of 75\nthe searches were conducted based on an individual determination of reasonable \nsuspicion.  Should records exist demonstrating any searches were done pursuant to such \nindividualized suspicion, such people would, by definition, not be members of the Fourth \nAmendment class. \n183.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the Primary Fourth Amendment \nclass are: \na.  whether Todd Dillard while the United States Marshal for the Superior \nCourt of the District of Columbia implemented a policy, custom and \npractice of subjecting female arrestees (but not similarly situated male \narrestees) being held in the Superior Court Cell Block pending presentment \nto blanket strip, visual body cavity searches and/or squat searches without \nan individualized determination that the woman was in possession of drugs, \nweapons or other contraband; \nb.  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth Amendment; \nc.  whether Todd Dillard was deliberately indifferent to the rights of such \nfemale arrestees; \nd.  Whether defendant District of Columbia had a policy or practice of \ncommitting its female arrestees to the custody of Todd Dillard when it \nknew or should have known that Todd Dillard’s deputies would subject the \n  39 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 40 of 75\nfemale arrestees (but not similarly situated male arrestees) to blanket strip \nsearches; \ne.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the Primary Fourth Amendment \nClass have sustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such \ndamages;  \nf.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the Primary Fourth Amendment \nclass and future members are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is \nthe nature of that relief; and \ng.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically representative \nsample of the Primary Fourth Amendment class provides the basis for \ndetermination of all Primary Fourth Amendment class members’ damages \nexcept those who opt out. \n184.  The Primary Fourth Amendment class is so numerous that joinder of all members \nis impracticable.  There are over 15,000 Primary Fourth Amendment class members. \n185.  Defendant District of Columbia has within its records the names and addresses of \nall the current and past Primary Fourth Amendment class members in the “CJIS” \ncomputer system (computerized booking program used by District of Columbia \nMetropolitan Police Department described below). \n186.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, because the Primary Fourth Amendment Named \n  40 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 41 of 75\nPlaintiffs and all other members of the Primary Fourth Amendment class were injured by \nexactly the same means, that is, by the blanket searches. \n187.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class and have retained counsel who are \ncompetent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action litigation and/or \ncomplex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n188.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are \ncontrary to or in conflict with those of the Primary Fourth Amendment class. \n189.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will \nbe encountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its maintenance \nas a class action, and the class action is superior to any other available means to resolve \nthe issues raised on behalf of the Primary Fourth Amendment Class.   \n190.  The Primary Fourth Amendment class action will be manageable because so many \ndifferent records systems exist from which to ascertain the members of the putative class.  \nClass treatment will be superior because liability can be determined on a class wide basis, \nand damages can also be determined on a class wide basis through use of statistical \nsampling or a “Dellums” matrix. \nFifth Amendment Class Action Allegations \n191.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules 23(a) and \n23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of each \n  41 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 42 of 75\nwoman who, during the Class Period (December 2, 1999, until the date the strip search \npolicies and practices complained of herein were terminated or until this case is \nterminated, whichever is earlier), was, (i) while in the Superior Court Cell Block or just \nbefore being put in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) being held for presentment subject \nto a statute of the District of Columbia; (iii) under similar circumstances as men arrestees; \n(iv) subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search. \n192.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules 23(a) and \n23(b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of each \nwoman who, during the Injunctive Relief Class Period (December 2, 1999 until the \npresent and into the future unless the Court acts to restrain the unlawful activity \ncomplained of herein), was or will be, (i) while in the Superior Court Cell Block or just \nbefore being put in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) being held for presentment subject \nto a statute of the District of Columbia; (iii) under similar circumstances as men arrestees; \n(iv) subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search..(This Class is \nhereafter at times referred to as the Fifth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class.) \n193.  Certification of a Fifth Amendment class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(2) is appropriate, because defendants District of Columbia and Todd Dillard had a \npolicy and engaged in a pattern and practice of conduct that has uniformly affected all \nmembers of the class, and injunctive relief against Defendants will benefit each and every \nplaintiff and class member. \n  42 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 43 of 75\n194.  The Fifth Amendment class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the \nsearches. \n195.  Certification of a Fifth Amendment class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(3) is also appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n196.  Regarding the Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs, and members of the Fifth \nAmendment class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because \nevery woman arrestee held in the Superior Court Cell Block is subjected to the blanket \nsearches, and none of the defendants keeps records of the searches and therefore none of \nthe defendants can show that any of the searches were conducted based on an individual \ndetermination of reasonable suspicion.  Should records exist demonstrating any searches \nwere done pursuant to such individualized suspicion, such people would, by definition, \nnot be members of the class. \n197.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na.  whether Todd Dillard implemented a policy or custom and practice of \nsubjecting female arrestees being held in the Superior Court Cell Block \npending presentment to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat \nsearches, but not subjecting men arrestees to such searches; \n  43 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 44 of 75\nb.  whether the policy of strip searching female arrestees serves any legitimate \nsecurity interest; \nc.  whether classification of similarly situated men and female arrestees into \nclasses based on gender bears any relationship to defendants’ asserted \nsecurity interest; \nd.  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fifth Amendment; \ne.  whether Todd Dillard or the District of Columbia were deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of such female arrestees; \nf.  Whether defendant District of Columbia had a policy or practice of \ncommitting its female arrestees to the custody of Todd Dillard when it \nknew or should have known that Todd Dillard’s deputies would subject \nfemales (but not similarly situated male arrestees) to blanket strip searches; \ng.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the Fifth Amendment class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages; and \nh.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the Fifth Amendment class and \nfuture members are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature \nof that relief; and \ni.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically representative \nsample of the Fifth Amendment class provides the basis for determination \nof all class members except those who opt out. \n  44 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 45 of 75\n198.  The Fifth Amendment class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.  The exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, \nbut is likely to consist of at least 15,000 people. \n199.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the \nother members of the Fifth Amendment class, because the Fifth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs and all other members of the Fifth Amendment class were injured by exactly \nthe same means, that is, by the blanket searches. \n200.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the members of the Fifth Amendment class and have retained counsel who are \ncompetent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action litigation and/or \ncomplex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n201.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are contrary to or in \nconflict with those of the Fifth Amendment class. \n202.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be \nencountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a \nclass action, and the class action is superior to any other available means to resolve the \nissues raised on behalf of the Fifth Amendment Class.  The Fifth Amendment class action \nwill be manageable because so many different records systems exist from which to \nascertain the members of the putative class.  Class treatment will be superior because \nliability can be determined on a class wide basis, and damages can also be determined on \na class wide basis through use of statistical sampling. \n  45 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 46 of 75\n203.  Defendant District of Columbia has within its computerized records described \nabove the names and addresses of all the current and past class members. \nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nCLAIMS OF PRIMARY FOURTH AMENDMENT NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nCount 1 \nViolation of Fourth Amendment Rights of Fourth Amendment Plaintiffs under § 1983 \n204.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n205.  While being held for presentment in the Superior Court Cell Block each of the \nPrimary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and every other Primary Fourth \nAmendment class member were subjected to a strip, visual body cavity search and/or \nsquat search without an individual determination that the search would reveal weapons, \ndrugs or other contraband, pursuant to a custom, policy and/or practice of Marshal \nDillard and the District of Columbia – each of which is jointly and severally liable and \nresponsible for such policy, custom and/or practice - to conduct such searches. \n206.  Subjecting an arrestee arrested on a non drug, non violent offense to a strip, visual \nbody cavity search and/or squat search without an individual determination that the \nsearch would reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband violates her Fourth Amendment \nRights. \n  46 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 47 of 75\n207.  The District of Columbia knew or should have known that the Primary Fourth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and other Primary Fourth Amendment class members were \nbeing and would be subjected to the searches in the Superior Court Cell Block and \nacquiesced in the searches. \n208.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the Primary \nFourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and the Primary Fourth Amendment class \nmembers’ Fourth Amendment Rights. \n209.  Todd Dillard’s and the District of Columbia’s policy, custom and practices \ndescribed above were the moving force behind the deprivations to the Primary Fourth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs’ and other Primary Fourth Amendment class members’ \nFourth Amendment Rights and the Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and the \nPrimary Fourth Amendment other class members’ injuries as described above. \n210.  Defendants caused the unreasonable strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat \nsearches of the Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and all other Primary \nFourth Amendment class members by deliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional \ninjury by implementing maintaining and/or acquiescing in a policy and practice and \ncustom of strip searching female arrestees. \n211.  At all relevant times Todd Dillard’s deputies and the District of Columbia’s \nemployees were acting within the scope of their employment, their acts were motivated \nby a desire to further the interests of Todd Dillard or the District of Columbia, and such \n  47 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 48 of 75\nemployees were acting in furtherance of the business of Todd Dillard or the District of \nColumbia. \n212.  In developing, implementing and participating in the custom, policy, practice and \nconduct complained of herein, Marshal Todd Dillard and his deputies were acting as \nagents of the District of Columbia. \n213.  Defendant District of Columbia and Defendant Todd Dillard are therefore liable \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for constitutional injuries to the Fourth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members caused by their conduct. \n214.  As a stand alone, alternative theory of liability the District of Columbia is liable \nfor its own policy or practice of transferring physical custody of its arrestees to the \nUnited States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia because the \nDistrict knew, or should have known, that the Superior Court Marshal’s deputies were \nsubjecting female, but not male, arrestees brought to the Courthouse for presentment to \nunconstitutional strip searches.  This is so regardless of the District’s relationship with \nTodd Dillard [United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia] \nand regardless of whether it established the policy of strip searching pre-presentment \narrestees at the D.C. Superior Court, regardless of whether it its agents or employees \nparticipated in or authorized the strip searches, and regardless of whether it had power to \nsupervise or control the actions of former Marshal Dillard or the U.S. Marshal's Service. \n215.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class Plaintiffs are informed \nand believe, and on that basis allege, that the conduct of Defendants, and each of them, \n  48 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 49 of 75\nhas been and, unless restrained, will continue to be deleterious to the constitutional and \nstatutory rights of plaintiffs, thereby inflicting irreparable harm on the Fourth \nAmendment Injunctive Relief Class. Said Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for \nthe injuries that are threatened by Defendants' continued failure to abide by and \nimplement the statutory and constitutional rights of the Primary Fourth Amendment \nInjunctive Relief Class.  Unless restrained, defendants will continue to deny said \nPlaintiffs their statutory and constitutional rights as expressed in this Complaint.  \nCount 2 \nDirect Liability of Todd Dillard for Violation of Fourth Amendment Rights of Fourth \nAmendment Plaintiffs for Illegal Searches \n216.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint.  \n217.  Each of the Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs was arrested under the \nauthority of a District of Columbia statute and held in the Superior Court Cell Block for \npresentment before a District of Columbia Superior Court Judge or other judicial officer.  \n218.  At all times that each of the Primary Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and \nevery other Primary Fourth Amendment class member was in the Superior Court Cell \nBlock, she was in the joint custody of Todd Dillard and the District of Columbia. \n219.  While in the Superior Court Cell Block, each of the Primary Fourth Amendment \nNamed Plaintiffs and every other Primary Fourth Amendment class member was \n  49 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 50 of 75\nsubjected to a strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat search by a deputy of Todd \nDillard without an individual determination that the search would reveal weapons, drugs \nor other contraband. \n220.  Defendant Todd Dillard violated the Fourth Amendment rights of the Primary \nFourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and the Primary Fourth Amendment class by \nestablishing and implementing the strip search policies described above.  \n221.  Defendant Todd Dillard is therefore directly liable under the Primary Fourth \nAmendment for constitutional injuries to the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and all \nother Primary Fourth Amendment class members caused by his conduct. \n222.  The Primary Fourth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class Plaintiffs are informed \nand believe, and on that basis allege, that the conduct of Defendant Todd Dillard, and/or \nof the current United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, \nand each of them, has been and, unless restrained, will continue to be deleterious to the \nconstitutional and statutory rights of plaintiffs, thereby inflicting irreparable harm on the \nFourth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class. Said Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at \nlaw for the injuries that are threatened by Defendants' continued failure to abide by and \nimplement the statutory and constitutional rights of the Primary Fourth Amendment \nInjunctive Relief Class.  Unless restrained, defendants will continue to deny said \nPlaintiffs their statutory and constitutional rights as expressed in this Complaint.  \nCLAIMS OF FIFTH AMENDMENT NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n  50 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 51 of 75\nCount 3 \nLiability of Defendants for Violation of Fifth Amendment Rights of Fifth Amendment \nPlaintiffs for Illegal Searches under § 1983 \n223.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all \nallegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n224.  While in the Superior Court Cell Block each of the Fifth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs and every other Fifth Amendment class member were subjected to a visual \nbody cavity search and squat search, pursuant to a custom, policy and/or practice of \nMarshal Dillard and the District of Columbia – each of which is jointly and severally \nliable and responsible for such policy, custom and/or practice - to conduct such searches. \n225.  While in the Superior Court Cell Block each of the Fifth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs and every other Fifth Amendment class member, was similarly situated to every \nmale arrestee, but said male arrestees were not subjected to a visual body cavity search \nand squat search, pursuant to a custom, policy and/or practice of Marshal Dillard and the \nDistrict of Columbia. \n226.  The visual body cavity and squat searches of the female arrestees did not serve any \nlegitimate security interest. \n227.  The classification of arrestees into classes based on gender bore no relationship to \ndefendants’ security interests. \n  51 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 52 of 75\n228.  Defendant District of Columbia knew that the Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs \nand other Fifth Amendment class members were being and would be subject to the \nabove-described searches in the Superior Court Cell Block and acquiesced in the strip \nsearches. \n229.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, resulted in the \nviolation of the equal protection rights of the Fifth Amendment class Named Plaintiffs \nand members under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the Fifth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and the Fifth Amendment class members’ Fifth \nAmendment Rights. \n230.  Todd Dillard’s and the District of Columbia’s policies, customs and practices \ndescribed above were the moving force behind the deprivations to the Fifth Amendment \nNamed Plaintiffs’ and other Fifth Amendment class members’ Fifth Amendment Rights. \n231.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately caused, and were the moving force behind the Fifth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs and the other Fifth Amendment class members’ injuries as described above. \n232.  Todd Dillard’s and the District of Columbia’s deputies and employees caused the \nunreasonable strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat searches of the Fifth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and all other Fifth Amendment class members by \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional injury by maintaining and/or \n  52 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 53 of 75\nacquiescing in a policy and practice of strip searching female arrestees but not similarly \nsituated male arrestees. \n233.  At all relevant times such Todd Dillard and District of Columbia employees were \nacting within the scope of their employment, their acts were motivated by a desire to \nfurther the interests of Todd Dillard and the District of Columbia, and such employees \nwere acting in furtherance of the business of Todd Dillard and the District of Columbia. \n234.  In developing, implementing and participating in the custom, policy, practice and \nconduct complained of herein, Marshal Todd Dillard was acting as an agent of the \nDistrict of Columbia. \n235.  Defendant District of Columbia and Defendant Todd Dillard are therefore liable \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for constitutional injuries to the Fifth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members caused by them. \n236.  As a stand alone, alternative theory of liability the District of Columbia is liable \nfor its own policy or practice of transferring physical custody of its arrestees to the \nUnited States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia because the \nDistrict knew, or should have known, that the Superior Court Marshal’s deputies were \nsubjecting female, but not male, arrestees brought to the Courthouse for presentment to \nunconstitutional strip searches.  This is so  regardless of the District’s relationship with \nTodd Dillard [United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia] \nand regardless of whether it established the policy of strip searching pre-presentment \narrestees at the D.C. Superior Court, regardless of whether it its agents or employees \n  53 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 54 of 75\nparticipated in or authorized the strip searches, and regardless of whether it had power to \nsupervise or control the actions of former Marshal Dillard or the U.S. Marshal's Service. \n237.  The Fifth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class Plaintiffs are informed and believe, \nand on that basis allege, that the conduct of Defendants, and each of them, has been and, \nunless restrained, will continue to be deleterious to the constitutional and statutory rights \nof plaintiffs, thereby inflicting irreparable harm on the Fifth Amendment Injunctive \nRelief Class. Said Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the injuries that are \nthreatened by Defendants' continued failure to abide by and implement the statutory and \nconstitutional rights of the Fifth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class.  Unless restrained, \ndefendants will continue to deny said Plaintiffs their statutory and constitutional rights as \nexpressed in this Complaint.   \nCount 4 \nDirect Liability of the United States Marshals Service and Todd Dillard for Violation of \nFifth Amendment Rights of Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs \n238.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all \nallegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n239.  Todd Dillard is directly liable under the Fifth Amendment for the strip searches of \nthe female arrestees (but not similarly situated male arrestees) described herein. \n240.  The Fifth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class Plaintiffs are informed and believe, \nand on that basis allege, that the conduct of Defendant Todd Dillard, and/or of the current \n  54 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 55 of 75\nUnited States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, and each of \nthem, has been and, unless restrained, will continue to be deleterious to the constitutional \nand statutory rights of plaintiffs, thereby inflicting irreparable harm on the Fifth \nAmendment Injunctive Relief Class. Said Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for \nthe injuries that are threatened by Defendants' continued failure to abide by and \nimplement the statutory and constitutional rights of the Fifth Amendment Injunctive \nRelief Class.  Unless restrained, defendants will continue to deny said Plaintiffs their \nstatutory and constitutional rights as expressed in this Complaint. \nCLAIMS OF “ALTERNATIVE FOURTH AMENDMENT CLASS” NAMED \nPLAINTIFFS \nALLEGATIONS ABOUT MALE ARRESTEES PLED IN THE ALTERNATIVE \n241.  Plaintiffs now plead in the alternative certain allegations relating to strip searches \nof both males and females arrestees. (See ¶¶ 4-5 and fn. 1, supra, for further explanation \nof the reason for this alternative pleading.) The alternative allegations encompass ¶¶ 241-\n272, after which the alternative causes of action are set forth. \n242.  Plaintiffs plead these allegations in the alternative based on information and belief \nand their understanding of statements made by attorneys for the federal defendants.  \n243.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding allegations from ¶ 1 up to and \nincluding ¶ 125. \n  55 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 56 of 75\n244.  Sometime in 1995, and continuing through the Class Period, including the \nInjunctive Relief Class Period, Todd Dillard implemented a practice or policy of having \ndeputies subject all arrestees, males as well as females, to blanket strip, visual body \ncavity and/or squat searches without a particularized finding of reasonable suspicion that \nthe arrestees are in possession of weapons, drugs or other contraband. \n245.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, this practice \nof having deputies subject all arrestees, males as well as females, to blanket strip, visual \nbody cavity and/or squat searches without a particularized finding of reasonable \nsuspicion that the arrestees were in possession of weapons, drugs or other contraband \nviolated the United States Marshals’ Service strip search policy (attached and \nincorporated by reference herein). \n246.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, Todd \nDillard’s deputies actually physically conducted the visual body cavity and squat \nsearches of the arrestees, males as well as females, in a hallway on the way to the \nSuperior Court Cell Block or in the Superior Court Cell Block. \n247.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, Deputies \nsubjected every single arrestee, males as well as females, to the strip searches described \nherein without exception and regardless of charge. \n248.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, Todd \nDillard’s deputies instructed deputies newly assigned to the Superior Court to conduct the \n  56 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 57 of 75\nblanket strip searches on all arrestees, males as well as females, as part of the new \ndeputies’ two day training program. \n249.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, after the \nthorough pat down searches and the “in-custody” searches, deputies then took the \narrestees, males as well as females, to the cell block area designated for arrestees and \nsubjected them to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches in the hallway \nleading to the Superior Court Cell Block or in the Cell Block or in the door way of the \nCell Block itself. \n250.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, a deputy \ndirected the arrestees, males as well as females, to pull up their skirts or lower their pants, \nand pull down any undergarments. \n251.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, a deputy \nthen made the arrestees, males as well as females, squat, turn around, and display their \nbuttocks and genitals to the deputy. \n252.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the deputies \nstood just a few feet away from the arrestees, males as well as females, as they performed \nthe strip searches and made a point of observing their genitalia and anus areas.  \n253.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the female \ndeputies did not place mirrors underneath the female arrestees as they squatted.  \n  57 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 58 of 75\n254.  Forcing a woman to squat is not an effective method of making contraband hidden \nin her vagina visible. \n255.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, deputies \nthen put the arrestees, males as well as females, in a holding cell designated for new lock \nups measuring about 30 to 50 feet. \n256.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the deputies \nconducted the strip searches of newly arrived arrestees, males as well as females, in front \nof all arrestees of the same sex already in the hallway leading from the reception area to \nthe Superior Court Cell Block, or in the Cell Block.  \n257.  One female arrestee subjected to the strip search in about 2002 described it as \nfollows: \nWe four women then walked into the cell one by one in single file.  The \nlead woman walked towards the back of the cell where a toilet was, \nfacing the back of the cell, and pulled her pants and underwear down, \nand crouched down in a half squat, displaying her buttocks to the female \nMarshal.  The female Marshal told the second girl in line, “Face the \nwall.”  Then the second and third woman also walked towards the back \nof the cell where the toilet was, facing the back of the cell, and pulled \ntheir pants and underwear down, and crouched down in a half squat, \ndisplaying their buttocks to the female Marshal.  The female Marshal \nwas screaming, “Keep moving, ladies.”  The other inmates were telling \nme I had to strip too.  “This is what you have to do when you get here”, \nthey said.  I turned to the female Marshal, and asked the female \nMarshal, “I don’t have to do that, do I”?  She screamed several times at \nme, “Keep moving, I don’t have all day.”  Then she barked at me, “Go \nto the end and do it.”  Then I walked to the back to the wall, turned \naround, pulled down my pants, and then I pulled down my underwear.  \nIt seemed like an eternity.  All the other inmates applauded. \n \n  58 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 59 of 75\n258.  After the deputies had completed processing and strip searching arrestees as \ndescribed herein, but before they presented arrestees, males as well as females, in the \npresentment courtrooms, they allowed arrestees to have unsupervised contact visits with \ntheir attorneys in conference cells. \n259.  The attorneys and the arrestees, males as well as females, in the conference cells \nwere separated only by grills that have 4 inch by 12 inch slots in the grill-work for items \nand paperwork to be passed through. \n260.  No arrestees were subjected to strip searches after the contact visits even though \narrestees were subjected to strip searches described herein before the contact visits. \n261.  The contact visits with attorneys were not the justification for any of the searches \nof arrestees described herein. \n262.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, agents of \nthe District of Columbia had actual knowledge of Todd Dillard’s practice of subjecting \nmales and females to blanket strip searches. Alternatively, agents of the District of \nColumbia knew or should have known of Todd Dillard’s practice of subjecting male and \nfemale arrestees to blanket strip searches. \n263.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, agents of \nthe District of Columbia such as police and pretrial services employees and CJA Office \nemployees conducting financial eligibility interviews regularly mingled at the Superior \nCourt courthouse with the Superior Court Marshals and arrestees, and knew about the \n  59 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 60 of 75\nsearches at all times within the Class Period. On information and belief, the Government \nof the District of Columbia knowingly, and as part of its practice, policy, and custom, \nnonetheless transferred arrestees in its custody to the custody of Todd Dillard (then \nUnited States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia), causing each \nmember of the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class to be subjected to the strip searches. \n264.  The MPD transport officers mingled with Todd Dillard’s deputies near the sally \nport and were aware of the strip searches of arrestees during the Class Period. \n265.  The strip searches of male and female arrestees were not supported by a legitimate \nsecurity interest. \n266.  For example, there is no documented history of contraband smuggling at the \nSuperior Court. \n267.  The deputies did not keep records of the strip searches of male and female \narrestees.  \n268.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period,  agents of \nthe District of Columbia such as police and pretrial services employees and CJA Office \nemployees conducting financial eligibility interviews regularly mingled at the Superior \nCourt courthouse with the Superior Court Marshals and arrestees, and knew about the \nblanket strip searches of male and female arrestees at all times within the Class Period. \n  60 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 61 of 75\n269.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the MPD \ntransport officers mingled with Todd Dillard’s deputies near the sally port and were \naware of the strip searches of male and female arrestees. \n270.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period,  the District \nof Columbia took no steps to stop the strip searches of male and female arrestees. \n271.  During the Class Period, including the Injunctive Relief Class Period, the District \nof Columbia delegated its duties regarding strip searches to Todd Dillard but failed to \ntrain Todd Dillard in strip search policies even though the need for training was obvious. \n272.   The constitutional violations that resulted were foreseeable because of the \nDistrict’s failure to train. \nAlternative Fourth Amendment Class Action Allegations \n273.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a) and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class \nconsisting of each male and female who, during the Class Period (December 2, 1999, \nuntil the date the strip search policies and practices complained of herein were terminated \nor until this case is terminated, whichever is earlier),was (i) while being held or just \nbefore being put in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) for presentment under a statute of \nthe District of Columbia; on either (iii)(a) a non drug, non violent traffic offense; (iii)(b) \na non drug, non violent misdemeanor; or (iii)(c) a non drug, non violent felony; (iv) was \nsubjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat search without any \n  61 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 62 of 75\nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he/she was \nconcealing drugs, weapons or other contraband.  \n274.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a), and 23(b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class \nconsisting of each person who, during the Injunctive Relief Class Period (December 2, \n1999 until the present and into the future unless the Court acts to restrain the unlawful \nactivity complained of herein), was or will be, (i) while being held or just before being \nput in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) for presentment under a statute of the District of \nColumbia; on either (iii)(a) a non drug, non violent traffic offense; (iii)(b) a non drug, \nnon violent misdemeanor; or (iii)(c) a non drug, non violent felony; (iv) was subjected to \na blanket strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat search without any individualized \nfinding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs, \nweapons or other contraband. (This Class is hereafter at times referred to as the \nAlternative Fourth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class.) \n275.  Certification of an Alternative Fourth Amendment class under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate because defendants District of Columbia and \nTodd Dillard had policies and engaged in a pattern and practice of conduct that has \nuniformly affected all members of the Alternative Fourth Amendment class, and \ninjunctive relief against Defendants will benefit each and every Alternative Fourth \nAmendment named plaintiff and Alternative Fourth Amendment class member. \n  62 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 63 of 75\n276.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment class is entitled to injunctive relief of \nterminating and prohibiting the resumption of the above described policy of blanket \nsearches not based on individualized or particularized suspicion or cause. \n277.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is also \nappropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over any individual \nquestions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient adjudication of this \ncontroversy as detailed below.  \n278.  Regarding the Alternative Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs, and members of \nthe Alternative Fourth Amendment class, there are no individual questions on the issue of \nliability, because every arrestee held in the Superior Court Cell Block during the \nalternative Class Period was subjected to the blanket strip searches, and none of the \ndefendants keeps records of the searches and therefore none of the defendants can show \nthat any of the searches were conducted based on an individual determination of \nreasonable suspicion.  Should records exist demonstrating any searches were done \npursuant to such individualized suspicion, such people would, by definition, not be \nmembers of the Alternative Fourth Amendment class. \n279.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na.  whether Todd Dillard while the United States Marshal for the Superior \nCourt of the District of Columbia implemented a policy, custom and \npractice of subjecting female arrestees and male arrestees being held in the \nSuperior Court Cell Block pending presentment to blanket strip, visual \n  63 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 64 of 75\nbody cavity searches and/or squat searches without an individualized \ndetermination that the arrestee was in possession of drugs, weapons or other \ncontraband; \nb.  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth Amendment; \nc.  whether Todd Dillard was deliberately indifferent to the rights of such \narrestees; \nd.  Whether defendant District of Columbia had a policy or practice of \ncommitting its male and female arrestees to the custody of Todd Dillard \nwhen it knew or should have known that Todd Dillard’s deputies would \nsubject the female arrestees and the male arrestees to blanket strip searches; \ne.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the Alternative Fourth Amendment \nclass have sustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such \ndamages;  \nf.  whether the Alternative Fourth Amendment class plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the Alternative Fourth Amendment class and future members \nare entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that relief; \nand \ng.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically representative \nsample of the class provides the basis for determination of all Fourth \nAmendment class members’ damages except those who opt out. \n  64 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 65 of 75\n280.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  There are \nover 15,000 Alternative Fourth Amendment class class members. \n281.  Defendant District of Columbia has within its records the names and addresses of \nall the current and past class members in the “CJIS” computer system (computerized \nbooking program used by District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department \ndescribed below). \n282.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment class Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of \nthe claims of the other members of the Alternative Fourth Amendment class, because the \nAlternative Fourth Amendment class Named Plaintiffs and all other members of the \nAlternative Fourth Amendment class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by \nthe blanket strip searches. \n283.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment class Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the Alternative Fourth Amendment \nclass and have retained counsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal \ncivil rights class action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n284.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment class Named Plaintiffs have no interests that \nare contrary to or in conflict with those of the Alternative Fourth Amendment class. \n285.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment class Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty \nthat will be encountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \n  65 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 66 of 75\nmaintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to any other available \nmeans to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Alternative Fourth Amendment class.   \n286.  The class action will be manageable.  Class treatment will be superior because \nliability can be determined on a class wide basis, and damages can also be determined on \na class wide basis through use of statistical sampling or a “Dellums” matrix. \nALTERNATIVE FOURTH AMENDMENT CLASS SUBSTANTIVE \nALLEGATIONS \nCount 5 \nViolation of Fourth Amendment Rights of Alternative Fourth Amendment Class \nPlaintiffs under § 1983 \n287.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment Class Named Plaintiffs reallege and \nincorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 125, and all the \nallegations in ¶ 241 forward. \n288.  While being held for presentment in the Superior Court Cell Block each of the \nAlternative Fourth Amendment Class Named Plaintiffs and every other Alternative \nFourth Amendment Class class member were subjected to a strip, visual body cavity \nsearch and/or squat search without an individual determination that the search would \nreveal weapons, drugs or other contraband, pursuant to a custom, policy and/or practice \nof Marshal Dillard and the District of Columbia – each of which is jointly and severally \nliable and responsible for such policy, custom and/or practice - to conduct such searches. \n  66 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 67 of 75\n289.  Subjecting an arrestee arrested on a non drug, non violent offense to a strip, visual \nbody cavity search and/or squat search without an individual determination that the \nsearch would reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband violates his/her Fourth \nAmendment Rights. \n290.  The District of Columbia knew or should have known that the Alternative Fourth \nAmendment Class Named Plaintiffs and other Alternative Fourth Amendment Class class \nmembers would be subject to the searches in the Superior Court Cell Block and \nacquiesced in the searches. \n291.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nAlternative Fourth Amendment Class Named Plaintiffs and the Alternative Fourth \nAmendment Class class members’ Fourth Amendment Rights. \n292.  Todd Dillard’s and the District of Columbia’s policy, custom and practices \ndescribed above were the moving force behind the deprivations to the Alternative Fourth \nAmendment Class Named Plaintiffs’ and other Alternative Fourth Amendment Class \nclass members’ Fourth Amendment Rights and the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class \nNamed Plaintiffs and the other Alternative Fourth Amendment Class class members’ \ninjuries as described above. \n293.  Defendants caused the unreasonable strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat \nsearches of the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class Named Plaintiffs and all other \nAlternative Fourth Amendment Class class members by deliberate indifference to the risk \n  67 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 68 of 75\nof constitutional injury by implementing maintaining and/or acquiescing in a policy and \npractice and custom of strip searching female arrestees. \n294.  At all relevant times Todd Dillard’s deputies and the District of Columbia’s \nemployees were acting within the scope of their employment, their acts were motivated \nby a desire to further the interests of Todd Dillard or the District of Columbia, and such \nemployees were acting in furtherance of the business of Todd Dillard or the District of \nColumbia. \n295.  In developing, implementing and participating in the custom, policy, practice and \nconduct complained of, Marshal Todd Dillard and his deputies were acting as agents of \nthe District of Columbia. \n296.  Defendant District of Columbia and Defendant Todd Dillard are therefore liable \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for constitutional injuries to the Alternative Fourth Amendment \nClass Named Plaintiffs and all other Alternative Fourth Amendment Class class members \ncaused by their conduct.  \n297.  As a stand alone, alternative theory of liability the District of Columbia is liable \nfor its own policy or practice of transferring physical custody of its arrestees to the \nUnited States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia because the \nDistrict knew, or should have known, that the Superior Court Marshal’s deputies were \nsubjecting female, but not male, arrestees brought to the Courthouse for presentment to \nunconstitutional strip searches.  This is so regardless of the District’s relationship with \nTodd Dillard [United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia] \n  68 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 69 of 75\nand regardless of whether it established the policy of strip searching pre-presentment \narrestees at the D.C. Superior Court, regardless of whether it its agents or employees \nparticipated in or authorized the strip searches, and regardless of whether it had power to \nsupervise or control the actions of former Marshal Dillard or the U.S. Marshal's Service. \n298.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class Plaintiffs are informed \nand believe, and on that basis allege, that the conduct of Defendants, and each of them, \nhas been and, unless restrained, will continue to be deleterious to the constitutional and \nstatutory rights of plaintiffs, thereby inflicting irreparable harm on the Alternative Fourth \nAmendment Injunctive Relief Class. Said Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for \nthe injuries that are threatened by Defendants' continued failure to abide by and \nimplement the statutory and constitutional rights of the Alternative Fourth Amendment \nInjunctive Relief Class.  Unless restrained, defendants will continue to deny said \nPlaintiffs their statutory and constitutional rights as expressed in this Complaint. \nCount 6 \nDirect Liability of Todd Dillard for Violation of Fourth Amendment Rights of Fourth \nAmendment Plaintiffs for Illegal Searches \n299.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment Class Named Plaintiffs reallege and \nincorporate by reference  the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 125, and all the \nallegations in ¶ 241 forward.  \n  69 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 70 of 75\n300.  Each of the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class Named Plaintiffs was arrested \nunder the authority of a District of Columbia statute and held in the Superior Court Cell \nBlock for presentment before a District of Columbia Superior Court Judge or other \njudicial officer.  \n301.  At all times that each of the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class Named \nPlaintiffs and every other Alternative Fourth Amendment class member was in the \nSuperior Court Cell Block, he/she was in the joint custody of Todd Dillard and the \nDistrict of Columbia. \n302.  While in the Superior Court Cell Block, each of the Alternative Fourth \nAmendment Class Named Plaintiffs and every other Alternative Fourth Amendment class \nmember was subjected to a strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat search by a \ndeputy of Todd Dillard without an individual determination that the search would reveal \nweapons, drugs or other contraband. \n303.  Defendant Todd Dillard violated the Fourth Amendment rights of the Alternative \nFourth Amendment Class Named Plaintiffs and class members by establishing and \nimplementing the strip search policies described above.  \n304.  Defendant Todd Dillard is therefore directly liable under the Fourth Amendment \nfor constitutional injuries to the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class Named Plaintiffs \nand all other Alternative Fourth Amendment class members caused by his conduct. \n  70 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 71 of 75\n305.  Alternatively, the Government of the District of Columbia knows, and knew at all \ntimes within the Class Period, or should have known, that female and male arrestees \nwould be subjected to blanket searches in the Superior Court Cell Block and the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia acquiesced in the searches. \n306.  Alternatively, the Government of the District of Columbia knowingly and as part \nof its practice, policy, and custom, nonetheless transferred female and male arrestees in \nits custody to the custody of Todd Dillard (then United States Marshal for the Superior \nCourt of the District of Columbia), causing each member of the Classes to be subjected to \nthe strip searches.  \n307.  As a stand alone, alternative theory of liability the District of Columbia is liable \nfor its own policy or practice of transferring physical custody of its arrestees to the \nUnited States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia because the \nDistrict knew, or should have known, that the Superior Court Marshal’s deputies were \nsubjecting female, but not male, arrestees brought to the Courthouse for presentment to \nunconstitutional strip searches.  This is so regardless of the District’s relationship with \nTodd Dillard [United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia] \nand regardless of whether it established the policy of strip searching pre-presentment \narrestees at the D.C. Superior Court, regardless of whether it its agents or employees \nparticipated in or authorized the strip searches, and regardless of whether it had power to \nsupervise or control the actions of former Marshal Dillard or the U.S. Marshal's Service. \n  71 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 72 of 75\n308.  The Alternative Fourth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class Plaintiffs are informed \nand believe, and on that basis allege, that the conduct of Defendant Todd Dillard, and/or \nof the current United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, \nand each of them, has been and, unless restrained, will continue to be deleterious to the \nconstitutional and statutory rights of plaintiffs, thereby inflicting irreparable harm on the \nAlternative Fourth Amendment Injunctive Relief Class. Said Plaintiffs have no adequate \nremedy at law for the injuries that are threatened by Defendants' continued failure to \nabide by and implement the statutory and constitutional rights of the Alternative Fourth \nAmendment Injunctive Relief Class.  Unless restrained, defendants will continue to deny \nsaid Plaintiffs their statutory and constitutional rights as expressed in this Complaint. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant the following relief: \n1)  declare that this action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) and certify the classes defined herein. \n2)  declare that defendants’ acts alleged above violate the Fourth and Fifth \nAmendments to the Constitution by illegally strip searching plaintiffs as alleged herein; \n3)  preliminarily and permanently enjoin defendants from pursuing the course of \nconduct complained of herein; \n4)  award all plaintiffs compensatory and consequential damages in an amount to be \ndetermined at trial; \n  72 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 84-2      Filed 12/05/2006     Page 73 of 75\n5)  award plaintiffs attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing this action under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and/or any other applicable statute or under the percentage of the fund \nmethod;  \n6)  grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n__________/sig/___________________ \nWILLIAM CLAIBORNE \nD.C.

The District of \nColumbia files this cross-claim against Todd Dillard under Fed. Civ. P. Rule 13(g) and states as \nfollows:  \n  1.        Plaintiffs have sued Todd Dillard, in his individual and official capacities, the \nUnited States Marshals Service, and the District of Columbia under the theory that the \ndefendants caused them (separately and concurrently) to be subjected strip searches at the D.C. \nSuperior Court cellblock in violation of the 4th and 5th amendments. See Second Amended \nComplaint, generally.  On February 8, 2008, the Court dismissed the United States Marshals \nService as a party to this lawsuit. See Docket #158. \n  2.       The District denies that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover at all.  However, in the \nevent that plaintiffs secures a judgment against defendant District of Columbia, the District is \n\nCasCea 1s:e0 21-:c0v2--0c2v3-06243-R64M-RCM   C  D   oDcoucmuemnet n1t6 126  3       FFiilleedd  0022//2299//20080  8 P  a  g Pea 2g eo f2 3 of 3\nentitled to contribution and/or indemnification from co-defendant Todd Dillard for any sums, \nplus interest and costs, adjudged against it in favor of the plaintiffs since the actions of the co-\ndefendant were the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries and damages, and any attributable acts \nof the District of Columbia were passive and secondary under plaintiff’s theory of joint liability \nand/or secondary liability.  Specifically, it is alleged that the co-defendant violated the 4th and 5th \namendments by instituting and implementing a policy which subjected the plaintiffs, all women, \nto strip searches without individualized suspicion. The co-defendant is liable to the District for \nall, or part of the claims asserted by the plaintiff against the District of Columbia in this action, \nby virtue of his practice and policy.  \n  3.  Furthermore, the District is entitled to contribution and/or indemnification from \nco-defendant Todd Dillard, to the extent Todd Dillard breached any duty owed to the District, \ncontractual or otherwise, express or implied, that proximately caused the plaintiffs’ injuries and \ndamages. \n4.  Both contribution and indemnity are available forms of relief under the laws of \nthe District of Columbia. See Grogan v. General Maintenance Service Co., 763 F.2d 444, 449 \n(D.C. Cir.1985), Rose v.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n)\nDIANNA JOHNSON, et al., )\n)\nPlaintiffs, )\n)\nv. ) Civil Action No. 02-2364 (RMC)\n)\nGOVERNMENT OF THE  )\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al., )\n)\nDefendants. )\n)\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nThe United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia\n(“Superior Court Marshal”) is a federal official.  Wishing that were not so,  Plaintiffs sue the District\nof Columbia for the actions of former Superior Court Marshal Todd Dillard in conducting strip\nsearches of all women awaiting presentment to a Superior Court judge, without reasonable and\nparticularized suspicion that any woman was carrying contraband on her person and without\nsubjecting men arrestees to the same strip searches.  These actions are alleged to have violated the\nFourth and Fifth Amendment rights of the women, who seek to recover money damages from the\nDistrict of Columbia pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The District of Columbia cannot be liable to\nPlaintiffs as a matter of law on any of the theories they advance, however, inasmuch as Marshal\nDillard was a federal official and not an employee, servant, agent or actor under the control of the\nDistrict of Columbia, and inasmuch as the District of Columbia had no choice but to turn over\narrestees to the Superior Court Marshal for presentment.  Therefore, the Court will grant the District\nof Columbia’s motion for summary judgment.\n\nI.  FACTS\nPlaintiffs are women who were arrested in the District of Columbia, taken to the\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia for presentment, and subjected to strip, visual body cavity\nand/or squat searches by Superior Court Marshal Dillard while being held in the Superior Court\ncellblock awaiting  presentment.  Plaintiffs are proceeding as two classes, a Fourth and a Fifth\nAmendment Class.1  The Fourth Amendment Class consists of all women who, between December\n2, 1999 and April 25, 2003, were held for presentment in the cellblock of the Superior Court for an\noffense that did not involve drugs or violence and who were subjected to a blanket policy of strip,\nvisual body cavity search and/or squat search without any individualized finding of reasonable\nsuspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband.  The Fifth\nAmendment Class consists of all women arrestees who, during the same time frame, were held for\npresentment in the cellblock of the Superior Court and who were subjected to a blanket policy of\nstrip, visual body cavity and/or squat search under similar circumstances for which men arrestees\nwere not subjected to a similar policy of blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches.  \nPlaintiffs seek to hold the District of Columbia liable for the strip searches  pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on three theories: (1) that the office of the Superior Court Marshal is part of the\norganic government of the District of Columbia; (2) that Marshal Dillard was a joint actor with the\nDistrict of Columbia in handling pre-presentment arrestees; and (3) that the District of Columbia\nentrusted  its pre-presentment arrestees to the custody of the Superior Court Marshal when it knew\n1  By Order dated February 8, 2008, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to certify these\nclasses and declined to certify an Alternative Fourth Amendment class that would have included\nmen.  See Dkt. # 159.  The Court also dismissed claims for injunctive relief against the United States\nMarshal Service.  See id.  \n2\n\nor should have known about the strip searches.  The District filed a motion for summary judgment,\narguing that it cannot be held liable as a matter of law under any of those theories.  After briefing\nwas completed, the Court held oral argument on October 7, 2008.\nII.  SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\nUnder Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment must be\ngranted when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c); Anderson v.\nLiberty Lobby, Inc.,  477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322\n(1986); Diamond v. Atwood, 43 F.3d 1538, 1540 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  Moreover, summary judgment\nis properly granted against a party that “after adequate time for discovery and upon motion . . . fails\nto make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case,\nand on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.  To\ndetermine which facts are “material,” a court must look to the substantive law on which each claim\nrests.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  A “genuine issue” is one whose resolution could establish an\nelement of a claim or defense and, therefore, affect the outcome of the action.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at\n322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  \nIn ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all justifiable\ninferences in the nonmoving party’s favor and accept the nonmoving party’s evidence as true.\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255.  A nonmoving party, however, must establish more than “the mere\nexistence of a scintilla of evidence” in support of its position.  Id. at 252.  To prevail on a motion for\nsummary judgment, the moving party must show that the nonmoving party “fail[ed] to make a\n3\n\nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on\nwhich that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.”  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.  By pointing to the\nabsence of evidence proffered by the nonmoving party, a moving party may succeed on summary\njudgment.  Id.  In addition, the nonmoving party may not rely solely on allegations or conclusory\nstatements.  Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  Rather, the nonmoving party\nmust present specific facts that would enable a reasonable jury to find in its favor.  Id.  If the\nevidence “is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.”\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50 (citations omitted).\nIII.  ANALYSIS\nThe District of Columbia occupies a unique place in the United States, neither a State\nnor a Territory but the “Seat of the Government of the United States.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 17.\nThe Constitution reserves to Congress the power “to exercise exclusive Legislation in all cases\nwhatsoever over such District . . . .”  Id.  Thus, Congress exercises plenary power over the District\nof Columbia, establishing a relationship quite different than the one that exists between the federal\ngovernment and the States.  See O’Donoghue v. United States, 289 U.S. 516, 539 (1933).  “The\nconstitutional grant sanctions congressional establishment of all of the trappings of municipal\nauthority in Washington, including the creation and oversight of all three branches of the District’s\ngovernment.”  Steven M. Schneebaum, The Legal and Constitutional Foundations for the District\nof Columbia Judicial Branch, 11 UDC/DCSL L. Rev. 13, 13 (2008).  The peculiarity of the\nrelationship comes sharply into focus when exploring the legal foundations for the local judiciary\nin the District of Columbia and the Superior Court Marshal.  A brief history of those legal\nfoundations is necessary to place the parties’ arguments in context.\n4\n\nA.   Legal Foundations for the District of Columbia Courts and Superior Court\nMarshal\nPrior to Congress’s enactment of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal\nProcedure Act of 1970 (“Court Reorganization Act”), Pub. L. No. 91-358, 84 Stat. 473 (1970), “the\ncourts charged with adjudicating local criminal prosecutions and revolving local civil disputes were\na hybrid creature.”  Schneebaum, 11 UDC/DCSL L. Rev. at 15.  “It could be said of them both that\nthey were part of the congressional mandate to oversee the District of Columbia, and they were fully-\nfledged stars in the federal judicial galaxy.”  Id.\nThe Court Reorganization Act brought fundamental changes, creating two new\nArticle I courts for the District of Columbia:  the Superior Court and the Court of Appeals, which\nwere formally separated from appellate review by the federal District Court and Circuit Court of\nAppeals.  See id. at 16.  Judges for the local District of Columbia courts were to be nominated by the\nPresident and subject to confirmation by the Senate.  See id.; D.C. Code § 11-1501(a).  “Congress\nexpressly noted in the statute that it was exercising its powers under Article I, § 8, clause 17 in\namending the D.C. Code to incorporate this latest overhaul of the third branch.”  Schneebaum, 11\nUDC/DCSL L. Rev. at 16; see D.C. Code § 11-101(2) (establishing the local District of Columbia\ncourts “pursuant to Article I of the Constitution”); see also Palmore v. United States, 411 U.S. 389,\n398 (1973) (noting same); Jenkins v. Wash. Convention Ctr., 236 F.3d 6, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (noting\nsame).\nDespite  these  fundamental  changes,  “there  was  no  question  that  the  Court\nReorganization Act was not promoted by its sponsors as a home rule measure . . . .”  Schneebaum,\n11 UDC/DCSL L. Rev. at 17.  As particularly relevant here, the Court Reorganization Act specified\n5\n\nthat “[t]he United States Marshal for the District of Columbia shall continue to serve the courts of\nthe District of Columbia, subject to the supervision of the Attorney General of the United States.”\nPub. L. No. 91-358, tit. 1, § 111, 84 Stat. 473, 512 (1970) (codified at D.C. Code  § 11-1729).\nHome rule came to the District of Columbia three years later when Congress passed\nthe District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act of 1973 (“Home\nRule Act”), Pub. L. No. 93-198, 87 Stat. 774 (1973).  For purposes of this dispute, only certain\nprovisions of the Home Rule Act are relevant.  The Act established a Judicial Nomination\nCommission of seven members to send three names to the President whenever a vacancy occurs on\na local court.  See Pub. L. No. 93-198, tit. IV, § 434, 87 Stat. 774, 796 (codified at D.C. Code § 1-\n204.34(a), (d)(1)).  Although the President continues to name a judge for the District of Columbia\nlocal courts with the advice and consent of the Senate, the President’s choice is constricted to one\nof the three persons recommended by the Judicial Nomination Commission.  See id. at § 433, 87\nStat. at 795 (codified at D.C. Code § 1-204.33(a)).\nIt was not accidental that Congress retained the role of the President and Senate in\nthe selection and appointment of judges to the District of Columbia Superior Court and Court of\nAppeals.  “The parallel between the District government and those of the fifty states was regularly\nchallenged with respect to the appointment process and did not withstand scrutiny.”  Schneebaum,\n11 UDC/DCSL L. Rev. at 19.  “Members of Congress, including supporters of the bill, insisted that\nthe District was not a state but a city, whose municipal executive should not have the power to\nnominate members of the judiciary.”  Id.\nDespite the congressional delegation of some of its authority to the newly-created\nMayor and Council of the District of Columbia, in the Home Rule Act Congress expressly\n6\n\n“reserve[d] the right, at any time, to exercise its constitutional authority as legislature for the District\n. . . .”  D.C. Code § 1-206.01.  In addition, Congress specifically precluded the Council from\n“enact[ing] any act, resolution, or rule with respect to any provision of Title 11 [of the District of\nColumbia Code] (relating to organization and jurisdiction of the District of Columbia courts),” id.\n§ 1-206.02(a)(4), and prohibited the Council from “enact[ing] any act or regulation relating to . . .\nthe duties or powers of . . . the United States Marshal for the District of Columbia.”  Id. § 1-\n206.02(a)(8).  Ultimately, “Congress . . . reserved to itself by legislation the power to organize and\nto oversee the third branch of the government of the District of Columbia.”  Schneebaum, 11\nUDC/DCSL L. Rev. at 24.\nOne final statute must be addressed before turning to the merits of the District’s\nmotion.  In the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690, tit. VII, § 7608(a)(1), 102 Stat.\n4181, 4512 (1988), Congress established the United States Marshals Service as “a bureau within the\nDepartment of Justice under the authority and direction of the Attorney General.”  Id. (codified at\n28 U.S.C. § 561(a)).  At the same time, Congress created the totally-new position of the Superior\nCourt Marshal.  See id. (codified at 28 U.S.C. § 561(c)).  Pursuant to the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, the\nPresident appoints, “by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a United States marshal for\neach judicial district of the United States and for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.”\n28 U.S.C. § 561(c).  Marshals must live within their districts except for “the marshal for the District\nof Columbia, for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, and for the Southern District of\nNew York. . . . .”  28 U.S.C. § 561(e)(1).  The Director of the Marshals Service “shall supervise and\ndirect” the entire Service “in the performance of its duties” and shall “appoint and fix the\ncompensation” of Service employees.  Id. § 561(f) & (g).  Every Marshal, including the Marshal for\n7\n\nthe  Superior  Court  of  the  District  of  Columbia,  must  meet  the  minimum  pre-employment\nqualifications established by Congress.  Id. § 561(i).\nThe “powers and duties” of United States Marshals are set out at 28 U.S.C. § 566.\n“It is the primary role and mission of the United States Marshals Service to provide for the security\nand to obey, execute, and enforce all orders of the United States District Courts, the United States\nCourts of Appeals, the Court of International Trade, and the United States Tax Court, as provided\nby law.”  Id. § 566(a).  Further,\nThe United States Marshals Service is authorized to –\n(A) provide for the personal protection of Federal jurists, court\nofficers, witnesses, and other threatened persons in the interests of\njustice where criminal intimidation impedes the functioning of the\njudicial process or any other official proceeding; and\n(B) investigate such fugitive matters, both within and outside the\nUnited States, as directed by the Attorney General.\nId. § 566(e)(1).\nB.   The Superior Court Marshal Acts Under Color of Federal Law\nPlaintiffs contend that the United States Marshals Service does not include the\nSuperior Court Marshal because D.C. Code § 11-1729 “obligates the Superior Court Marshal to\n‘serve’ the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, an integral part of the government of the\nDistrict of Columbia,” which subjects the Superior Court Marshal to the authority of the Superior\nCourt “with respect to his handling of District of Columbia prisoners in the Superior Court\n(including pre-presentment arrestees).”   Pls.’ Partial Opp’n to District of Columbia’s Statement of\nMaterial Facts (“Pls.’ Fact Opp’n”) ¶ 4.  This argument is the linchpin of Plaintiffs’ suit against the\n8\n\nDistrict of Columbia.  See id. ¶ 1 (Superior Court Marshal is a § 1983 person because he handles pre-\npresentment arrestees pursuant to § 11-1729); ¶ 2 (Marshals Service has no authority over Superior\nCourt Marshal, who acts pursuant to §11-1729); ¶ 3 (Superior Court has power over Superior Court\nMarshal under § 11-1729); ¶¶ 6 & 8 (Superior Court Marshal, whose authority stems from § 11-\n1729, is part of the “personnel” of the Superior Court); ¶ 9 (the Superior Court Marshal “serves” the\nSuperior Court pursuant to § 11-1729 so that the Superior Court “could order the Superior Court\nMarshal to stop the strip searches as a matter of law”); ¶ 11 (“the Superior Court Marshal serves the\nSuperior Court”); ¶ 16 (“The Superior Court Marshal handles pre-presentment arrestees pursuant to\nD.C. Code § 11-1729 or the inherent powers of the Superior Court.”).  \nPlaintiffs misconstrue the applicable statutory provisions.  To begin with, D.C. Code\n§ 11-1729 was part of the Court Reorganization Act, adopted by Congress eighteen years before the\ncreation of the office of the Superior Court Marshal as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act.  It,\ntherefore, referenced only the United States Marshal for the District of Columbia, clearly a federal\nposition within the United States Marshals Service, and ordered that Marshal to continue to serve\nthe new, local, courts.  See D.C. Code § 11-1729.  Plaintiffs rely on § 11-1729 as the sole source of\nauthority for the Superior Court Marshal to handle pre-presentment arrestees, but their reliance is\nnot supported by the text of the statute or the history of the District of Columbia local court system,\nas outlined above.2  \n2  Since 1970, Congress has increasingly treated the District of Columbia as a separate\npolitical entity and not just a congressional domain, perhaps brought to the realization that the city\nhad become a major urban center by the riots after the 1968 assassination of Rev. Martin Luther\nKing Jr.  See Schneebaum, 11 UDC/DCSL L. Rev. at 16 & n.18.  Congress first reorganized the local\ncourt system, then granted limited home rule, and now recognizes Eleanor Holmes Norton as a non-\nvoting Congresswoman for the District of Columbia.  Although Congress retains its authority to\nlegislate for the District of Columbia, it considers locally-adopted legislation only after the fact.  See\n9\n\nPlaintiffs also downplay the relevance of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, the legislative\nsource that created the office of the Superior Court Marshal and from which the authority of the\nSuperior Court Marshal — like every other United States Marshal — logically and expressly derives.\n See 28 U.S.C. §§ 561-566.  That enactment leaves no doubt that the Superior Court Marshal and\nthe Marshal for the District of Columbia are separate positions as they are each named in the statute.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 561(e)(1).  Plaintiffs assert that the statute gives no authority to the Superior Court\nMarshal because § 566(a) states that the “primary role and mission” of the United States Marshals\nService is the security and carrying-out of orders of specifically-named federal courts, without\nreference to the District of Columbia Superior Court.  See id. § 566(a).  While subsection (a) of  \n§ 566 is so limited,3 Plaintiffs fail to appreciate the authority of the Marshals Service to “provide for\nthe personal protection of Federal jurists, court officers, witnesses, and other threatened persons in\nthe interests of justice where criminal intimidation impedes on the functioning of the judicial process\nor any other official proceeding.”  Id. § 566(e)(1)(A).  The Superior Court Marshal exercises\nauthority over all persons to be presented to a Superior Court judge (a “court officer”) in order to\nprovide for the judge’s “personal protection” and to avoid “criminal intimidation” which could\nimpede “the functioning of the judicial process” of the Superior Court.  Id.   Plaintiffs’ reliance on\nD.C. Code § 1-206.02(c)(1).  By contrast, Congress requires federal executive and legislative\noversight and approval of appointments to the District of Columbia local courts, even as it respects\ntheir decisions to go through a normal appellate process.  See D.C. Code §§ 1-204.33(a); 11-1501(a).\n  More particularly, Congress has established the Superior Court Marshal as part of the United States\nMarshal Service with the same presidential nomination and Senate confirmation requirements as all\nother United States Marshals.  See 28 U.S.C. § 561(c).\n3  The following analysis assumes that the District of Columbia Superior Court judges are\nnot “Federal jurists” within the meaning of § 566(a).  While the United States argues that the\nSuperior Court is a “federal” court, the Court need not decide this issue.  See infra, n. 6. \n10\n\nD.C. Code § 11-1729 also ignores the very real authority that the Director of the Marshals Service\nexercises over the Superior Court Marshal, as a member of the Marshals Service.  See id. § 561(f)\n& (g).  Plaintiffs’ repeated argument that the Superior Court Marshal is not part of the Marshals\nService or subject to the Director’s authority is simply wrong and flatly contradicted by the plain\nlanguage of the statutory provisions.  See id. & § 561(c).\nPlaintiffs seek to avoid the Anti-Drug Abuse Act because it is undisputedly a\ngenerally applicable congressional enactment that applies well beyond the boundaries of the District\nof Columbia.  Rather, seeking to apply Fletcher4 and Settles,5 they argue that D.C. Code § 11-1729\nis a law applicable solely to the District of Columbia, rendering the Superior Court Marshal a § 1983\n“person” when handling District of Columbia arrestees, even if he is otherwise a federal employee.\nThis argument fares no better than its predecessor.  D.C. Code § 11-1729 provides a shaky\nfoundation to the argument:  it expressly provides that the Marshal for the District of Columbia shall\nbe “subject to the supervision of the Attorney General of the United States.”  D.C. Code § 11-1729.\nThus, even under § 11-1729 the Marshal acts under the control of the federal government, not the\nlocal District of Columbia government.  This conclusion is strengthened by the provision in the\nCourt Reorganization Act, of which D.C. Code § 11-1729 is a part, that prohibits the District of\nColumbia Council from adopting any law that would impact the authority of the United States\n 4  See Fletcher v. Dist. of Columbia, 370 F.3d 1223, 1227 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“Fletcher I”)\n(holding that members of the United States Parole Commission are amenable to suit under § 1983\nfor actions taken pursuant to § 11231 of the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government\nImprovement Act of 1997 (“Revitalization Act”), Pub. L. No. 105-33, 111 Stat. 251, 745 (1997)).\n 5  See Settles v. United States Parole Comm’n, 429 F.3d 1098, 1104 (D.C. Cir. 2005)\n(reaffirming the holding in Fletcher I that “a cause of action under § 1983 will lie against the\nindividual members of the [United States Parole] Commission when acting pursuant to the\nRevitalization Act § 11231”).\n11\n\nMarshal for the District of Columbia.  See D.C. Code § 1-206.02(a)(8).  In addition, Settles and\nFletcher both involved § 11231 of the Revitalization Act, a law applicable exclusively to the District\nof Columbia that transferred authority from the District of Columbia Parole Board to the United\nStates Parole Commission; thus, when the members of the United States Parole Commission\nexercise authority over District of Columbia prisoners, they are acting in the stead of District of\nColumbia government officials.  The same cannot be said of the Superior Court Marshal, whose\noffice was created pursuant to § 7608(a)(1) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, a generally applicable\ncongressional enactment, and who inherited duties from a federal official, the United States Marshal\nfor the District of Columbia.\nPlaintiffs also fail to appreciate the complex status of the local District of Columbia\ncourts.  They posit that the District of Columbia Superior Court and the District of Columbia Court\nof Appeals are an “integral part of the government of the District of Columbia” as if they were fully\nanalogous to the Mayor and Council, both of whom are elected by the local citizens and whose\nauthorities were established by the Home Rule Act, not the earlier Court Reorganization Act.  The\nlocal court system is different from the local executive and legislature:  while the Judicial\nNomination Committee sends three names to the President, only upon presidential nomination and\nSenate confirmation can a candidate become a judge.  See D.C. Code §§ 1-204.33(a); 11-1501(a).\nThe general population of the District of Columbia plays no part in this process.  See Schneebaum,\n11 UDC/DCSL L. Rev. at 18-20.  The intent behind the Court Reorganization Act was clearly to\nestablish Article I courts for the District of Columbia, separate and apart from the federal Article III\ncourts.  See id. at 16.  There was then a further grant of local authority for executive and legislative\nbranches in the Home Rule Act, with some limitations on the Council’s authority to adopt legislation\n12\n\naffecting the District of Columbia courts.  See D.C. Code § 1-206.02(a)(4).  Thus, it is unclear —\nand the Court need not determine — the degree to which the District of Columbia Superior Court\nand the District of Columbia Court of Appeals can truly be considered “integral” to the District of\nColumbia government but the very uncertainty of the question saps the force of Plaintiffs’ further\nargument that the Superior Court Marshal is also “integral” to the local government and not the\nfederal government.6  \nIn any event, even were D.C. Code § 11-1729 the bulwark Plaintiffs proclaim it to\nbe, by its express terms it is not applicable to the Superior Court Marshal but only to the Marshal for\nthe District of Columbia.  See D.C. Code § 11-1729.  As emphasized above, the position of Superior\nCourt Marshal was only established in 1988 as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act.  See 28 U.S.C. §\n561(c).  The creation of that office superseded the provisions of D.C. Code § 11-1729 on which\nPlaintiffs rely, as it must have because the Superior Court Marshal inherited the former duties of the\nMarshal for the District of Columbia vis-a-vis the Superior Court.  See id. & § 561(e)(1).  Plaintiffs’\nargument that the Superior Court Marshal has no authority to handle Superior Court arrestees unless\nfrom § 11-1729 or the inherent power of the Superior Court is erroneous.  The Superior Court\nMarshal’s authority stems directly from the relevant provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, as it\ndoes for every other United States Marshal.\n6  The United States argues that the District of Columbia Superior Court and the District of\nColumbia Court of Appeals are actually “federal” courts.  While there is some support for that\nposition, see Handy v. Shaw, Bransford, Veilleux & Roth, 325 F.3d 346, 351 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (noting\nthat the District of Columbia Superior Court “is a congressionally created court and, thus, ‘federal’\nin its creation”), there is also support for the opposing view.  See Galloway v. Superior Court of Dist.\nof Columbia, 816 F. Supp. 12, 19 (D.D.C. 1993) (Superior Court is a component of the District of\nColumbia government).  The Court need not weigh in on the question because  the dispositive issue\nin this case is the status of the Superior Court Marshal, not the Superior Court.\n13\n\nC. The District of Columbia Cannot be Held Liable Because It Has No\nAuthority to Control the Superior Court Marshal and No Choice But to\nTurn Over its Arrestees to the Superior Court Marshal\nPlaintiffs contend that they need complete discovery before they can address certain\nissues raised by their claims and the District’s motion for summary judgment.  They assert that,\nwithout more discovery, they cannot address whether the Superior Court Marshal “may have acted\nin concert with the government of the District of Columbia and become a § 1983 person,” Pls.’\nOpp’n to Fed. Defs.’Amicus Brief at 10, or whether the District of Columbia is liable because it\nentrusted its pre-presentment arrestees to the custody of the Superior Court Marshal when it knew\nor should have known about the blanket policy of strip searches.  Id. at 15.  Plaintiffs suggest that\ndiscovery to date supports both theories: a deponent for the Federal Defendants under Rule 30(b)(6)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure testified that the Superior Court Marshal was just like a\n“puppet” of the District in the Superior Court cellblock and Marshal Dillard described his position\nas similar to a “guest” without control and with security decisions made by the Superior Court.  Id.\nat 14.  However, because Plaintiffs’ arguments fail as a matter of law, no more discovery is needed.\nNo “joint actor” liability exists because the Superior Court Marshal is admittedly in\nexclusive control of handling pre-presentment arrestees to the Superior Court and, as discussed\nabove, the Superior Court Marshal derives his authority from generally applicable federal law, not\nDistrict of Columbia law.  Therefore, because the District of Columbia has no authority over the\nSuperior Court Marshal, Marshal Dillard’s conduct that Plaintiffs’ allege violated their constitutional\nrights “cannot be fairly treated as that of the District of Columbia.”  Williams v. United States, 396\nF.3d 412, 415 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  Plaintiffs seek to avoid summary judgment by contesting facts\nproffered by the District of Columbia.  However, all of Plaintiffs’ fact disputes with the District of\n14\n\nColumbia depend on the asserted authority granted to the Superior Court Marshal under D.C. Code\n§ 11-1729, which, as explained above, is not legally correct.  See Pls.’ Fact Opp’n  ¶¶ 1-4, 6, 8-9,\n11, 16.  Rather, the Superior Court Marshal’s authority over pre-presentment arrestees is part of his\nauthority to protect court officers, including Superior Court judges, derived from federal law.  See\n28 U.S.C. § 566(e)(1)(A).  Inasmuch as the District of Columbia does not have the status of a State,\nand is subject to the plenary legislative authority of the Congress, it has no authority over the\nSuperior Court Marshal’s handling of pre-presentment arrestees before they are presented in the\nSuperior Court.\nPlaintiffs’ entrustment theory fails for the same reason.  Implicit in that theory is that\nthe entrusting entity “had a choice over whether to follow the challenged course of action.”  Jones\nv. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d 537, 553 (D. Md. 2007).  Congress established the United States Marshal\nfor the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and that Marshal performs the same protective\nduties for local Article I District of Columbia court judges as the marshals in other judicial districts\nperform for Article III federal court judges.  See 28 U.S.C. §§ 561(c), 566(e)(1)(A).  As is the case\nin an Article III federal court, no detained person can be presented to a Superior Court judge without\npassing through the hands of the Superior Court Marshal.  See D.C. Code §§ 24-201.13; 24-201.14.\nThe District of Columbia has no other alternative but to turn over its arrestees to the Superior Court\nMarshal.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot recover on an entrustment theory.  Further discovery cannot\nchange these legal relationships.  \n15\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\nBecause the Superior Court Marshal is a federal employee acting pursuant to\ngenerally applicable federal law, and because the District of Columbia has no authority to control\nthe Superior Court Marshal and no choice but to turn over arrestees to him, the District of Columbia\ncannot be held liable for his allegedly unconstitutional acts.  Accordingly, the  District’s motion for\nsummary judgment [Dkt. # 178] will be granted and the District of Columbia will be dismissed as\na party in this case.  A memorializing Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\nDated: October 31, 2008 __________/s/___________                       \nROSEMARY M. COLLYER\nUnited States District Judge\n16",

The United States Marshals Service (\"USMS\") has sought return of three electronic \nmail messages and a case assignment form, which it submits were subject to attorney\"client \nprivilege and/or work product protection, but inadvertently released to Plaintiffs counsel during \ndiscovery.  Those four documents were initially produced pursuant to a protective order without \nany redactions and originally paginated 000436, 000439, 000440, and 000442, and subsequently \nre-released.  All unredacted versions of those documents will be referred to as the ''unredacted \ndocuments\" throughout this stipulation. \n2.  The parties have a dispute regarding the effect of the disclosure of the unredacted \ndocuments.  In order to resolve their dispute, and without conceding that any waiver has in fact \noccurred, the parties stipulate (subject to the Court's approval) that the unredacted documents \nwill be treated as described in the following paragraphs. \n3.  Plaintiffs may retain the unredacted documents in their un-redacted form for use in \nthis litigation only. \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 212   Filed 10/09/09   Page 2 of 4\n4.  The unredacted documents remain protected material subject to the protective order \nentered in this case.  Therefore,.although Plaintiffs may use the unredacted documents in Johnson \nv. Dillard, the parties cannot file the unredacted documents on the public record or make other \npublic disclosures that would violate the protective order. \n5.  The parties may not show the unredacted documents to a witness unless that witness: \na.  is the author or recipient of that specific unredacted document; \nb.  opened the electronically-mailed version of the unredacted document for \nthe sender or recipient of that specific unredacted document; \nb.  is defendant Todd Dillard; \nc.  is a current employee of the USMS Office of General Counsel; \nd.  is a former employee of the USMS Office of General Counsel and agrees \nto sign a confidentiality agreement requiring that the unredacted \ndocuments be handled in accordance with the protective order; \ne.  is a current or former USMS employee who previously saw the unredacted \ndocuments in un-redacted form, and agrees to sign a confidentiality \nagreement requiring that the unredacted documents be handled in \naccordance with the protective order. \n6.  By permitting Plaintiffs to use those unredacted documents, Defendant does not waive \nany privileges or protections that may pertain to the information contained in the documents. \nThe parties also agree that this stipulation does not waive attorney-client privilege or work \nproduct protection for any undisclosed communications and/or documents, even if those other \ncommunications and/or documents concern the same subject matter as the unredacted \ndocuments.  Nor are any privileges or objections waived regarding any internal deliberations that \nmay have taken place within the federal government about the reasons for changing the District \nof Columbia Superior Court search policy and/or practice by permitting plaintiffs to use these \nfour unredacted documents. \n7.  This agreement applies only to Johnson v.

Superior Court Todd Dillard, and the U.S.\nMarshal's Service have moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The\nmotions have been fully briefed and the parties presented oral argument on October 31, 2006. After carefully\nconsidering the parties' briefs and arguments, the Court concludes that Defendants' motions must be denied.\n50 *50 In resolving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must treat the complaint's factual allegations 00 including mixed\n97\nquestions of law and fact 00 as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. Warren v. District of\n97\nColumbia, 353 F.3d 36, 40 (D.C.Cir.2004); Holy Land Found. for Relief & Dev. v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 156, 165\n(D.C.Cir.2003). It is not necessary for the plaintiff to plead all elements of his prima facie case, see Swierkiewicz\nv. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 511-14, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), or \"plead law or match facts to every\nelement of a legal theory,\" Krieger v. Fadely, 211 F.3d 134, 136 (D.C.Cir.2000) (internal quotations and citation\nomitted). The Court will not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim unless the defendant can show beyond\ndoubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief. Kingman\nPark Civic Ass'n v. Williams, 348 F.3d 1033, 1040 (D.C.Cir.2003); Gilvin v. Fire, 259 F.3d 749, 756 (D.C.Cir.2001).\nThe District of Columbia argues that the First Amended Complaint fails to state a claim against it under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 because it did not establish the policy of strip searching pre-presentment arrestees at the D.C. Superior\nCourt, none of its agents or employees participated in or authorized the strip searches, and it had no power to\nsupervise or control the actions of former Marshal Dillard or the U.S. Marshal's Service. But the First Amended\nComplaint alleges that the District knew, or should have known, that U.S. Marshals at the D.C. Superior Court\nwere unconstitutionally strip searching arrestees and yet, with deliberate indifference, continued to entrust its\narrestees to former Marshal Dillard's custody. First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 110-120, 123-24, & 176-177. These\nallegations are sufficient to state a claim under § 1983. See Warren, 353 F.3d at 39; Baker v. District of Columbia,\n326 F.3d 1302, 1306-07 (D.C.Cir.2003).\nFormer Marshal Dillard raises three arguments in support of his motion. First he argues that the claims against\nhim must be dismissed because he is entitled to qualified immunity. The first step in deciding if qualified immunity\napplies is to determine whether the complaint alleges the deprivation of a constitutional right. Int'l Action Ctr. v.\nU.S., 365 F.3d 20, 24 (D.C.Cir.2004). Here, the First Amended Complaint alleges that U.S. Marshals 00 at the\n97\ndirection of and pursuant to a policy developed by former Marshal Dillard 00 subjected putative class members to\n97\nblanket strip searches and visual cavity searches without a reasonable individualized suspicion that the class\n\nmembers were concealing weapons or contraband. See, e.g., First Am. Compl. ¶ 83. The First Amended\nComplaint also alleges that all female arrestees at the D.C. Superior Court were subjected to blanket strip\nsearches, but similarly situated male arrestees were not strip searched. See id. ¶ 85. These allegations, if true,\nadequately allege violations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. See, e.g., Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 62-66\n(2d Cir.2001) (holding that a blanket strip search policy at county jail violated Fourth Amendment); Yates v.\nStalder, 217 F.3d 332, 334 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that treating similarly situated male and female inmates\ndifferently can constitute an equal protection violation).\nThe next question in deciding qualified immunity is whether the constitutional rights in question were clearly\nestablished at the time of the alleged violation. Int'l Action Ctr., 365 F.3d at 24. Although there are no D.C. Circuit\nopinions addressing the exact conduct alleged here, relevant Supreme Court authority provides sufficiently clear\n51 guidance to government officials regarding the proper scope of *51 strip searches of arrestees such as the\nputative class members. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)\n(establishing a balancing test to determine whether a strip search is valid under the Fourth Amendment); U.S. v.\nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996) (holding that governmental discrimination\nbetween males and females violates Equal Protection unless the government shows an \"exceedingly persuasive\njustification\" for the disparate treatment). Based on these authorities, the Court finds that it would have been clear\nto any reasonable official in former Marshal Dillard's position that a blanket strip-search policy under which all\nfemale 00 but not male 00 arrestees were strip searched, regardless of the offenses with which they were charged\n97 97\nor any individualized suspicion that they were concealing contraband, was unconstitutional under the Fourth and\nFifth Amendments. Accordingly, former Marshal Dillard is not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage in the\nproceeding.\nSecond, former Marshal Dillard argues that the First Amended Complaint fails to state a claim against him under\n§ 1983 because he was not acting under color of state law when the alleged strip searches occurred. A person,\nincluding a federal agent, may be considered a state actor for purposes of § 1983 if he is a \"willful participant in\njoint activity with the State or its agents.\" Williams v. U.S., 396 F.3d 412, 414 (D.C.Cir.2005); see also Case v.\nMilewski, 327 F.3d 564, 567 (7th Cir.2003) (\"it is assumed that a § 1983 action can lie against federal employees\n00 as it can against private individuals 00 if they conspire or act in concert with state officials to deprive a person of\n97 97\nher civil rights under color of state law.\"); cf. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc., 457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct.\n2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982) (holding that conduct is actionable under § 1983 if it is \"fairly attributable to the\nState.\"). Here, the First Amended Complaint alleges that former Marshal Dillard and the District of Columbia\nacted in concert with the purpose of executing a jointly developed unconstitutional policy of strip searching all\nfemale 00 but not male 00 arrestees without individualized suspicion. See, e.g., First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 69, 85, 131,\n97 97\n185. The Court concludes that these allegations 00 which must be treated as true at this stage in the proceedings\n97\n00 raise sufficient questions of contested fact so that it cannot determine, at this time, that former Marshal would\n97\nnot qualify as a \"state actor\" as a matter of law.\nThird, former Marshal Dillard argues that the First Amended Complaint fails to allege that he personally engaged\nin conduct that violated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. On the contrary, the First Amended Complaint alleges that\nformer Marshal Dillard developed the blanket strip search policy that led to Plaintiffs' injuries. See First Am.\nCompl. ¶¶ 173 & 179.\nFinally, the U.S. Marshal's Service argues that the claims against it for injunctive relief must be dismissed for lack\nof jurisdiction because Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they face a reasonable probability of again being\nsubjected to an unconstitutional strip search at the D.C. Superior Court. See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461\nU.S. 95, 109-110, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (holding that a plaintiff lacks standing to enjoin a\ngovernment agency from engaging in an unconstitutional practice unless the plaintiff demonstrates a \"real and\nimmediate threat of again being\" subject to the practice). The First Amendment Complaint arguably alleges that\nat least some of the named plaintiffs might again be arrested and subjected to strip searches at the D.C. Superior\n52 Court. See First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 142-145, *52 167-170, 205-206. But because determinations regarding standing\nto seek injunctive relief also bear upon class certification, the Court believes it preferable to resolve this issue in\nthe context of Plaintiffs' motion to certify the class. See Barnett v. County of Contra Costa, Case No. 04-4437\n(TEH), Order at 5 (N.D.Cal. Oct. 31, 2005). The U.S. Marshal's Service is free to raise this issue again at the\nappropriate time.\n\nBased on the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED that [Dkt. # 63] the District of Columbia's Motion to Dismiss is\nDENIED, and that [Dkt. # 62] the Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The appropriateness \nof these invasive procedures doubtless looks different from the \nperspective of detainees such as Appellants—women forced to \nendure strip searches while awaiting presentment hearings at the \nDistrict of Columbia Superior Court. Alleging that such searches \nviolate the Fourth Amendment and, where men are not similarly \nstrip  searched,  the  Fifth  Amendment’s  equal  protection \nguarantee,  these  women  filed  this  class  action  against  the \nDistrict of Columbia and the former United States Marshal for \nthe  Superior  Court  who  administered  the  Superior  Court \ncellblock. Because men and women at the cellblock are now \nstrip searched only upon individualized reasonable suspicion, we \nhave no occasion to consider whether the policies under which \nclass members were strip searched may continue. Rather, the \nonly question in this case is whether class members can recover \ndamages from the District or from the former Superior Court \nMarshal. The district court granted summary judgment to the \nDistrict, concluding that because the Superior Court Marshal in \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 3 of 25\n3 \ncharge of the cellblock was at all times a federal official acting \nunder color of federal law, the city had no authority to prevent \nthe strip searches. The district court also granted summary \njudgment to the Superior Court Marshal, finding him entitled to \nqualified immunity. We affirm both rulings.  \nI. \n  Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-\n690, tit. VII, § 7608(a)(1), 102 Stat. 4181, 4512–15 (1988) \n(codified at 28 U.S.C. §§ 561–569), two United States Marshals \nserve the District of Columbia. The first, the U.S. Marshal for \nthe District of Columbia, serves the U.S. District Court and this \nCourt. 28 U.S.C. § 566(b). The second, the U.S. Marshal for the \nDistrict of Columbia Superior Court, serves that court only. 28 \nU.S.C. § 561(c). During the time of the events at issue in this \ncase, Appellee, Todd Dillard, served as Superior Court Marshal. \n  Sometime in the mid- to late-1990s, Dillard, concerned that \ndetainees were bringing weapons, drugs, and other contraband \ninto the cellblock, began requiring all incoming detainees to \nundergo a three-step search. Detainees first passed through metal \ndetectors; they were then patted down by deputy marshals; and, \nfinally, they were required to remove their clothing, squat, and \ncough to dislodge any hidden contraband. The parties refer to \nthese “drop, squat, and cough” searches as strip searches. Given \nthat “[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all \njustifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor,” Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986), we infer from the \nevidence presented that despite Dillard’s facially gender-neutral \npolicy, deputy marshals in fact subjected male detainees to strip \nsearches only upon individualized reasonable suspicion. By \ncontrast, all women were forced to drop, squat, and cough. This \nincluded female pre-presentment arrestees charged with non-\nviolent,  non-drug offenses. After completing the three-step \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 4 of 25\n4 \nsearch process, female pre-presentment arrestees proceeded to \ninterview  rooms  outside  presentment  courtrooms.  Roughly \neighty percent of female arrestees were released following these \nhearings.  \n  In 2002, a class of women detained and strip searched at the \nSuperior Court cellblock filed this suit seeking damages and \ninjunctive relief. After the United States Marshals Service halted \nstrip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion, class \nmembers abandoned their claims for injunctive relief and filed \nan amended complaint in which they sought only monetary relief \nfrom the District of Columbia and Dillard, whom they sued in \nhis personal and professional capacities. The District and Dillard \nseparately moved to dismiss the complaint for failing to state \nany claims upon which relief could be granted. The district court \ndenied  both  motions  and  certified  two  classes:  a  Fourth \nAmendment Class and a Fifth Amendment Class. The Fifth \nAmendment Class includes all female pre-presentment arrestees \nheld at the Superior Court cellblock between December 2, 1999 \nand April 25, 2003 and subjected to strip searches “under similar \ncircumstances for which men arrestees were not.” See Johnson \nv. District of Columbia, 584 F. Supp. 2d 83, 86 (D.D.C. 2008). \nThe  Fourth  Amendment  Class  includes  all  female  pre-\npresentment arrestees who, during the same time period, were \nstrip searched without individualized reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause and who were arrested for non-drug, non-violent \noffenses. See id.    \nFollowing  class  certification,  the  district  court  entered \nsummary judgment in favor of the District. Believing that the \nSuperior Court Marshal is a federal official who acted at all \ntimes under color of federal law, and that the District therefore \nhad no choice but to turn pre-presentment arrestees over to the \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 5 of 25\n5 \nMarshal, the court concluded that the District could not be held \nliable for any unconstitutional acts of the Marshal. Id. at 90–93. \nAfter further discovery, the district court orally granted \nDillard summary judgment on all claims against him in his \nprofessional capacity, finding that his status as a federal official \nleft him beyond the reach of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Johnson v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 780 F. Supp. 2d 62, 68 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(describing this holding). Several months later, the district court, \nfinding Dillard entitled to qualified immunity, granted him \nsummary judgment on all claims against him in his personal \ncapacity.  As  for  the  claims  of  Fourth  Amendment  Class \nmembers, the district court, relying on our recent decision in \nBame v. Dillard, 637 F.3d 380 (D.C. Cir. 2011), where we \nrejected similar Fourth Amendment claims brought by male \ndetainees against the very same Marshal Dillard, see id. at 382, \nconcluded that any Fourth Amendment rights Dillard might have \nviolated were insufficiently clearly established at the time of the \nviolation. Johnson, 780 F. Supp. 2d at 73–75. As for the claims \nof Fifth Amendment Class members, the court, relying on \nAshcroft  v.  Iqbal,  556  U.S.  662  (2009),  found  no  Equal \nProtection violation because nothing in the record indicated that \nDillard intended to treat women differently from men. Johnson, \nat 780 F. Supp. 2d at 79–81.  \nOn appeal, class members press their claims against the \nDistrict and Dillard, but only in his personal capacity. We \nreview the district court’s grants of summary judgment de novo, \nviewing  the  evidence  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  class \nmembers. See, e.g., Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. \nCir. 2006). We first consider whether class members may hold \nthe District liable for Dillard’s conduct. Then, taking the Fourth \nand Fifth Amendment claims separately, we consider whether \nDillard is entitled to qualified immunity. \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 6 of 25\n6 \nII. \nMembers of both the Fourth and Fifth Amendment Classes \nseek to hold the District of Columbia liable under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 for the Superior Court Marshal’s conduct. As the Supreme \nCourt explained in Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 \nU.S. 658 (1978), municipalities can be held liable under section \n1983 only “when execution of a government’s policy or custom, \nwhether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts \nmay fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury.” \nId. at 694. Conceding that no express District policy gave rise to \ntheir injuries, class members offer two theories—the “organic \ntheory”  and  the  “entrustment  theory”—to  explain  how  the \nDistrict might nonetheless be liable under section 1983 for \nDillard’s conduct.  \nOrganic Theory \n  According to this theory, the Superior Court Marshal’s \nOffice is “part of the organic government of the District of \nColumbia just as much as the Mayor, City Council and Superior \nCourt.” Appellants’ Br. 44 (emphasis omitted). Claiming that \nthe Superior Court is best understood as a state court, not a \nfederal court, class members argue that the Superior Court \nMarshal derives his authority from “the inherent powers of the \nSuperior Court.” Appellants’ Br. 50. Insofar as the Superior \nCourt Marshal “handles pre-presentment arrestees . . . as the \npolicy  maker  for  the  District,  by  delegation  from  the \npolicymaker, or pursuant to a widespread custom or practice in \nwhich the District of Columbia acquiesced,” Appellants’ Br. 44, \nclass members urge us to find the District liable under section \n1983 for any unconstitutional acts of the Marshal.  \nBut we agree with the district court that the Superior Court \nMarshal is not a District official. Rather, the Superior Court \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 7 of 25\n7 \nMarshal “logically and expressly derives” his authority from \nfederal law, specifically the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. See \nJohnson, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 90. Pursuant to that Act, “[t]he \nPresident shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate, a United States marshal for each judicial district of \nthe United States and for the Superior Court of the District of \nColumbia.” 28 U.S.C. § 561(c). Like all other U.S. Marshals, the \nSuperior Court Marshal “shall be an official of the Service and \nshall serve under the direction of the Director,” id., who “shall \nsupervise and direct the United States Marshals Service in the \nperformance of its duties.” 28 U.S.C. § 561(g). Each U.S. \nMarshal serves a four year term unless he resigns or is removed \nby the President. 28 U.S.C. § 561(d). Thus, Dillard, as Superior \nCourt Marshal, was appointed and confirmed through a federal \nprocess, served as part of a federal agency under the direction of \na federal official, and at all times could have been removed by \nthe President. Under these circumstances, Dillard was hardly as \nmuch  “part  of  the  organic  government  of  the  District  of \nColumbia . . . as the Mayor.” Appellants’ Br. 44 (emphasis \nomitted). \nAcknowledging that the Superior Court Marshal qualifies as \na federal official for purposes of appointment and removal, class \nmembers nonetheless argue that he derives no authority from \nfederal law. But why would Congress create a U.S. Marshal’s \noffice for a particular court and yet deny the holder of that office \nany federal authority? Class members have no answer, nor do \nwe. Instead, class members find this bizarre result implicit in \ntwo provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act. They first point to \nsection 566(a), which outlines the “primary role and mission of \nthe United States Marshals Service.” 28 U.S.C. § 566(a). Under \nthis section, U.S. Marshals “provide for the security and . . . \nobey, execute, and enforce all orders of the United States \nDistrict Courts, the United States Courts of Appeals, the Court \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 8 of 25\n8 \nof International Trade, and the United States Tax Court, as \nprovided by law.” Id. As class members emphasize, this list does \nnot include the Superior Court. Second, class members seize on \nthe word “Federal” in section 566(e)(1), which authorizes the \nUnited States Marshals Service “to provide for the personal \nprotection of Federal jurists, court officers, witnesses, and other \nthreatened persons.” 28 U.S.C. § 566(e)(1). Class members \nargue that inclusion of the word “Federal” makes the entire \nsubsection inapplicable to the Superior Court because, according \nto them, the Superior Court is equivalent to a state court. From \nthese two provisions, class members conclude, “[T]he Act \naddresses the USMS’s role regarding the federal courts (as \nopposed to addressing at all the local D.C. Courts).” Appellants’ \nBr. 48.  \nClass members’ reliance on these provisions is misplaced. \nFor  one  thing,  section  566(a)  lays  out  the  “primary”—not \n“exclusive”—“role and mission of the United States Marshals \nService.” Nothing in section 566(a) suggests that Congress \nintended to deprive the Superior Court Marshal of all federal \nauthority within the court Congress designated that Marshal to \nserve. Moreover, given the dual federal/state status of Superior \nCourt judges, Congress would have had to have used more \nspecific language than “Federal jurist” to exclude them from \nsection 566(e)(1)’s authorizations, especially given Congress’s \ndecision to create the office of Superior Court Marshal. See \nUnited States v. Stewart, 104 F.3d 1377, 1391 (D.C. Cir. 1997) \n(noting that D.C. Superior Court judges are “Article I . . . judges, \nwhom Congress intended to be analogous to state court judges” \nand holding that a federal statute “authorized [them] to act as \nfederal committing magistrates”). In any event, the statutory \nscheme gives the District no power to exercise authority over or \ndelegate authority to the Superior Court Marshal. Instead, the \nstatute clearly says that the Superior Court Marshal serves at the \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 9 of 25\n9 \n“direction” of the United States Marshals Service. See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 561(c). Thus, any authority Dillard exercised as Superior \nCourt Marshal, whether delegated by the United States Marshals \nService or provided directly by statute, was federal in nature.  \nBecause Dillard, as Superior Court Marshal, was at all times \na federal official acting under color of federal law, the organic \ntheory provides no basis for finding the District liable under \nsection 1983.  \nEntrustment Theory \nUnder  this  theory,  the  District  exhibited  deliberate \nindifference to Dillard’s unconstitutional conduct by continuing \nto send pre-presentment arrestees to the Superior Court cellblock \ndespite knowing they would be strip searched there. Holding a \nmunicipality liable for its deliberate indifference requires more \nthan “a showing of simple or even heightened negligence.” \nBoard of County Commissioners v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 407 \n(1997); see also City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390 \n(1989) (requiring that plaintiffs show that the municipality’s \npolicy was “so likely to result in the violation of constitutional \nrights,” and the need to change that policy “so obvious,” that \npolicymakers “can reasonably be said to have been deliberately \nindifferent  to  the  need”).  To  prevail  on  this  theory,  class \nmembers would have to show at least that the District had actual \nor constructive notice of unconstitutional strip search practices, \nas well as discretion to stop sending pre-presentment arrestees to \nthe Superior Court Marshal. See Warren v. District of Columbia, \n353 F.3d 36, 36–39 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“[F]aced with actual or \nconstructive knowledge that its agents will probably violate \nconstitutional  rights,  the  city  may  not  adopt  a  policy  of \ninaction.”).  \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 10 of 25\n10 \nWe agree with the district court that even assuming that the \nDistrict had notice of the strip search practices and that those \npractices were unconstitutional, the District lacked the discretion \nnecessary for class members to prevail. Given that Dillard was at \nall times acting under color of federal law, see supra 6–9, the \nDistrict had no authority to prevent him from conducting strip \nsearches of arrestees upon their arrival at the Superior Court. \nRelying on two circuit court decisions, one by this Court and one \nby the Sixth Circuit, see Warren, 353 F.3d 36; Deaton v. \nMontgomery County, 989 F.2d 885 (6th Cir. 1993), for the \nproposition that “[i]t does not matter if the transferor has no \ncontrol  over  the  facility  in  which  it  places  its  prisoners,” \nAppellants’ Br. 34, class members believe they can prevail even \nif Dillard was at all times a federal official acting under color of \nfederal law. In each of the cited cases, however, the municipality \nhad contracted to send its prisoners to a penal facility; even \nthough the municipality exercised no direct control over policies \nand practices at the facility, it retained power to cancel the \ncontract in the event of constitutional violations. See Warren, \n353 F.3d at 37; Deaton, 989 F.2d at 885. Here, by contrast, \nnothing in the record suggests that the District could have held \npresentment hearings somewhere other than the Superior Court. \nAnd although class members insist that the District had statutory \nauthority to bypass the Superior Court Marshal and deliver pre-\npresentment arrestees directly to Superior Court judges, the \nstatutory provisions class members rely on are ambiguous at \nbest. Thus, the District’s failure to embrace class members’ \nstatutory  interpretation  hardly  demonstrates  “deliberate \nindifference to the rights” of arrestees. See Canton, 489 U.S. at \n388. Class members also claim that the District would lack \nauthority to issue citations or release arrestees on bond if it had \nto deliver all arrestees to the Superior Court Marshal. But the \nMarshal  exercises  federal  authority  over  persons  actually \ndelivered  to  the  Superior  Court  for  presentment,  not  over \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 11 of 25\n11 \neveryone the Metropolitan Police Department detains. And \nwhile the District might issue citations for minor offenses such \nas traffic violations, arrestees have a right to a presentment \nhearing. See D.C. SUPERIOR CT. R. CRIM. P. 5(a); see also \nCounty of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 53 (1991) \n(“[W]arrantless  arrests  are  permitted  but  persons  arrested \nwithout a warrant must promptly be brought before a neutral \nmagistrate for a judicial determination of probable cause.” \n(citing Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 114 (1975))).  \nBecause neither the organic nor the entrustment theory \ntransforms  the  Superior  Court  Marshal  into  a  District \npolicymaker for purposes of section 1983, the District cannot be \nheld liable for Dillard’s conduct. We thus turn to the question of \nDillard’s liability. \nIII. \n  Relying on Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. \n388 (1971), Fourth and Fifth Amendment Class members bring \nconstitutional tort claims against Dillard in his personal capacity. \nIn  response,  Dillard  argues  that  he  is  entitled  to  qualified \nimmunity.  While  carrying  out  their  official  duties,  federal \nofficials enjoy qualified immunity from damages suits in order \nto “shield them from undue interference with their duties and \nfrom  potentially  disabling  threats  of  liability.”  Harlow  v. \nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 807 (1982). To overcome a claim of \nqualified immunity, plaintiffs must show both that an official \n“violated a constitutional right” and that “the right was clearly \nestablished” at the time of the violation. Saucier v. Katz, 533 \nU.S. 194, 200–01 (2001). The Supreme Court has made clear \nthat courts may address the two stages of the qualified immunity \nanalysis in either order. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, \n236 (2009) (“The judges of the district courts and the courts of \nappeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 12 of 25\n12 \ndeciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity \nanalysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in \nthe particular case at hand.”). Grateful for that flexibility, we \naddress the claims of the two classes in turn.  \nThe Fourth Amendment Class \n  Fourth Amendment Class members urge us to find that “the \nFourth  Amendment  prohibits  blanket  strip  searches  of \n[detainees]  arrested  on  minor  charges,”  at  least  where  no \ndetainees were held in the general population and “there [is] no \nsignificant contraband problem.” Appellants’ Br. 17, 26–28. \nLike the district court, however, we have no need to reach the \nmerits of this contested constitutional question in order to find \nDillard entitled to qualified immunity. Under our decision in \nBame v. Dillard, 637 F.3d 380, 384 (D.C. Cir. 2011), any Fourth \nAmendment right Dillard might have violated was insufficiently \nclearly established at the time. See Pearson, 555 U.S. at 237 \n(approving of addressing only the second stage of the qualified \nimmunity analysis where “it is plain that a constitutional right is \nnot clearly established but far from obvious whether in fact there \nis such a right”).  \nIn  Bame,  this  Court,  addressing  only  the  “clearly \nestablished” stage of the qualified immunity analysis, found \nDillard entitled to qualified immunity for Fourth Amendment \nclaims brought by male plaintiffs—claims otherwise virtually \nindistinguishable from those brought by Fourth Amendment \nClass members in this case. Like class members, Bame plaintiffs \nwere  arrested  for  non-drug,  non-violent  offenses,  held \ntemporarily at “various police holding facilities,” brought to the \nSuperior Court “to await disposition of the charges against \nthem,” “strip searched upon arrival” at the Superior Court \ncellblock, placed together in holding cells, and released directly \nfrom the Superior Court cellblock without spending any time in \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 13 of 25\n13 \ngeneral jail populations. Bame, 637 F.3d at 382–83. The strip \nsearches at issue in Bame occurred in September 2002, near the \nend of the Fourth Amendment Class period. Id. at 383. \nAccording to Bame plaintiffs, by the time Dillard had \nimplemented the challenged policies, the circuits had reached a \n“consensus” that policies similar to Dillard’s violated the Fourth \nAmendment. See Bame, 637 F.3d at 385. But in Bell v. Wolfish, \n441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Supreme Court rejected a Fourth \nAmendment  challenge  to  a  penal  strip  search  policy  and \ninstructed courts evaluating such challenges to “consider the \nscope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \nwhich it is conducted.” Id. at 559. In Bame, we held that Dillard, \nbalancing these factors, could reasonably have concluded that \nhis strip search policy was constitutional. Bame, 637 F.3d at 386 \n(“Clearly, it was reasonable for Dillard, like the courts of appeal \nthat reached the issue after 2002, to believe strip searching all \nmale arrestees was consistent with the law as set forth in Bell \n[and  United  States  Marshals  Service  policy  statements].”). \nAlthough Bame plaintiffs, like class members here, emphasized \nthat  they  were  charged  with  minor  non-drug,  non-violent \noffenses, we noted that “[t]he policy that the Court categorically \nupheld in Bell applied to all inmates, including those charged \nwith lesser offenses and even those charged with no wrongdoing \nat all who were being held as witnesses in protective custody.” \nId. at 387 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although Bame \nplaintiffs,  like  class  members  here,  emphasized  the  short \nduration  of  their  stay  at  the  Superior  Court  cellblock,  we \nresponded that “[c]ontrary to the plaintiffs’ contention, nothing \nwhatsoever in Bell suggests its holding is limited to overnight \ndetention facilities.” Id. Although Bame plaintiffs, like class \nmembers here, insisted that they never came into contact with \ndetainees housed in general jail populations, we emphasized that \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 14 of 25\n14 \n“Bell  [nowhere]  mention[ed],  let  alone  rel[ied]  upon, \n[intermingling with other detainees] as a reason for upholding \nthe strip searches. In any event, arrestees held at the Superior \nCourt were in fact commingled with other arrestees in holding \ncells; no one suggests each arrestee was put in a separate cell.” \nId. And finally, although Bame plaintiffs, like class members \nhere,  challenged  the  sufficiency  of  Dillard’s  contraband \njustification, we concluded that “the record here substantiates \nDillard’s point that the Superior Court had a persistent problem \nwith contraband being smuggled into the cellblock, the very \nreason for strip searches.” Id.  \nFourth Amendment Class members attempt to distinguish \nBame in three ways. First, they point to a consent agreement—\nthe so-called Morgan Order—in which the District promised \n“not [to] conduct strip or squat searches of female police cases \nhoused at the District of Columbia Detention Facility in the \nabsence of a reasonable suspicion.” See Morgan v. Barry, 596 F. \nSupp.  897,  898  (D.D.C.  1984)  (explaining  the  agreement) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). According to class members, \nthis agreement, which protects only female arrestees and thus \nwas not at issue in Bame, put Dillard on notice that strip \nsearching class members would violate their Fourth Amendment \nrights.  In  the  Morgan  Order,  however,  the  District  never \nconcedes that any particular strip search policies violate the \nFourth Amendment. Moreover, the Morgan Order binds only \nthe District and its agents at the District of Columbia Detention \nFacility, not Dillard, a federal official in charge of the Superior \nCourt cellblock.  \nSecond, Fourth Amendment Class members claim that in \nBame  we  addressed  the  constitutionality  of  strip  searches \nwithout “individualized, reasonable suspicion” whereas they \nfocus on “the right of arrestees, not entering general population, \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 15 of 25\n15 \nto be free from strip searches prior to presentment to the court.” \nAppellants’  Br.  70.  Contrary  to  class  members’  assertion, \nhowever, in Bame we expressly rejected the notion that Bell \nlimited penal strip searches to overnight, general population \nfacilities. See Bame, 637 F.3d at 387. \nThird, Fourth Amendment Class members argue that “any \ncontraband problem that may have existed in the Superior Court \ncellblock had evaporated by 1999 or 2000,” Appellants’ Br.  29, \nand that the Superior Court Marshal’s failure to strip search all \nmen belies the asserted effectiveness of strip searches. But in \nBame we evaluated similar evidence of contraband and found \nthat the Superior Court suffered from a “persistent problem with \ncontraband” as late as 2002. 637 F.3d at 387. In any event, as the \nSupreme  Court  observed  in  Bell,  a  dearth  of  recovered \ncontraband “may be more a testament to the effectiveness of this \nsearch technique as a deterrent.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. And even \nif deputy marshals did not strip search all men, that hardly \ncompels the conclusion that Dillard understood strip searches to \nbe generally ineffective.  \n  Thus, like the district court, we see no daylight between the \nclaims we rejected in Bame and the ones Fourth Amendment \nClass members press here. See Johnson, 780 F. Supp. 2d at 74–\n75 (“[T]he claims addressed in Bame and the instant case cannot \nbe distinguished in any meaningful way.”). Although class \nmembers obviously disagree with Bame, that decision is binding \non us. As a result, Dillard is entitled to qualified immunity \nbecause the Fourth Amendment right he is accused of violating \nwas not clearly established at the time of any violation. \nThe Fifth Amendment Class \n  Fifth Amendment Class members maintain that the strip \nsearch gender disparity violated the Fifth Amendment’s equal \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 16 of 25\n16 \nprotection guarantee. We resolve these claims, unlike the claims \nof the Fourth Amendment class, at the first stage of the qualified \nimmunity analysis by examining whether Dillard violated class \nmembers’ Fifth Amendment rights.  \nThe parties agree that Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 \n(2009),  controls  this  issue.  In  Iqbal,  the  Supreme  Court \naddressed “[t]he factors necessary to establish a Bivens violation \n.  .  .  [w]here  the  claim  is  invidious  discrimination  in \ncontravention of the . . . Fifth Amendment[].” Id. at 676. \nBecause “purposeful discrimination requires more than ‘intent as \nvolition or intent as awareness of consequences,’” id. (quoting \nPersonnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. \n256,  279  (1979)),  supervisors  face  no  liability  for  mere \n“knowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates’ use of \ndiscriminatory criteria,” id. at 677 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Instead,  under  Iqbal,  plaintiffs  must  show  that \nsupervisors acted with discriminatory purpose. Id. (“[P]urpose \nrather than knowledge is required . . . .”). “[T]he plaintiff must \nplausibly plead and eventually prove not only that the official’s \nsubordinates violated the Constitution, but that the official by \nvirtue of his own conduct and state of mind did so as well.” \nDodds v. Richardson, 614 F.3d 1185, 1198 (10th Cir. 2010). \n  Acknowledging that they “must prove Dillard intended to \ndiscriminate against women arrestees,” Fifth Amendment Class \nmembers  argue  that  Dillard  “intended  a  policy,  formal  or \ninformal, of women-only strip searches.” Appellants’ Br. 52. For \nhis part, Dillard insists that his policy throughout the class \nperiod required “every prisoner”—both male and female—to go \nthrough the strip search process upon arrival at the Superior \nCourt cellblock. See, e.g., Dillard Bame Deposition 89:6–98:3. \nAlthough class members point to some evidence from which we \nmight infer that Dillard knew deputies were implementing his \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 17 of 25\n17 \ngender neutral policy in a gender imbalanced manner, plenty of \nother evidence suggests that Dillard was largely missing in \naction throughout the class period. But even assuming class \nmembers could show that Dillard knew what was going on at the \ncellblock, they have pointed to no evidence from which we \ncould  infer  that  Dillard  himself  intended  to  treat  women \ndifferently from men. For instance, class members cite a former \ndeputy marshal’s testimony that the practice in the cellblock was \nto strip search all female detainees but not all males because of \ncertain “differences in the anatomy.” Shealey Deposition 158:8–\n162:22. But that same former deputy went on to testify that any \ndisparate  treatment  did  not  reflect  Dillard’s  policy: \n“[Supervisors] put [no] emphasis on females. They basically \n[made] sure that everybody was thoroughly searched coming \ninto that cell block, and that we had policies and procedures in \nplace to conduct those searches to make sure that no contraband \ncame into those cell blocks.” Shealey Deposition 164:7–13. This \nis hardly an isolated example. Indeed, class members cite no \ntestimony by any subordinate indicating that the gender disparity \nresulted from Dillard’s instruction or intention.  \nClass members also claim that the United States Marshals \nService admitted in interrogatory responses in two other cases \nthat despite Dillard’s assertions “the ‘more customized’ policy \nwas to stop strip searching males and to continue strip searching \nfemales.” Appellants’ Br. 60. But these responses, both written \nby the same deputy marshal who testified that supervisors “put \n[no]  emphasis  on  females,” describe the “practice” among \ndeputies  at  the  cellblock,  not  Dillard’s  policies.  Helton \nInterrogatory Response 4; Clifton Interrogatory Response 5.  \nIn a final effort to demonstrate discriminatory purpose, class \nmembers ask us to grant them an adverse inference from missing \nevidence. Specifically, they claim that although Dillard prepared \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 18 of 25\n18 \na written policy statement during the class period laying out \nSuperior Court operating procedures, he failed to produce a copy \nduring discovery. “Because defendant never acknowledged or \nproduced Dillard’s written search policy,” class members assert, \n“plaintiffs are entitled to an adverse inference that the policy was \nto strip search all female prisoners but not males.” Appellants’ \nBr. 58. Dillard, however, has not only consistently denied the \nexistence of any undisclosed policy statement but has also \nmaintained that he left behind all official documents at the end \nof his term as Superior Court Marshal because “they were \ngovernment  property.”  Dillard  Br.  65.  Even  assuming  an \nundisclosed policy statement once existed, an adverse inference \nfrom missing evidence is appropriate only “if it is peculiarly \nwithin the power of one party to produce the evidence . . . . The \nparty complaining of the missing evidence bears the burden of \ndemonstrating  that  it  is  peculiarly  in  the  opposing  party’s \ncontrol.” Czekalski v. LaHood, 589 F.3d 449, 455 (D.C. Cir. \n2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Since class members \nnowhere dispute Dillard’s explanation for why he left behind all \nofficial documents, they have failed to show that the policy \nstatement was ever “peculiarly within [Dillard’s] power . . . to \nproduce” or “peculiarly in [Dillard’s] control.” Id. \nWe thus agree with the district court that “there is no \ncircumstantial  or  direct  evidence  that  Marshal  Dillard \npurposefully  directed  that  women  and  men  be  searched \ndifferently at the Superior Court cellblock.” Johnson, 780 F. \nSupp. 2d at 81. Under Iqbal, then, Dillard is entitled to qualified \nimmunity because class members have failed to show that he \nviolated their Fifth Amendment rights.    \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 19 of 25\n19 \nIV. \n  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm. \nSo ordered.  \n \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 20 of 25\nROGERS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and concurring\nin the judgment.  I write principally because this court, as in ten\nother circuits, should “clearly establish[],” Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n457 U.S. 800, 818–19 (1982), that indiscriminate strip searching\nof individuals awaiting presentment on non-violent, non-drug\noffenses  who  are  not  held  in  the  general  population  is\nunconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution in the absence of reasonable suspicion an\nindividual possesses contraband or weapons.  See Bame v.\nDillard,  637  F.3d  380,  388  (D.C.  Cir.  2011)  (Rogers,  J.,\ndissenting).\nI. \nIn the absence of en banc review, Bame, 637 F.3d 380, is\nthe law of the circuit, see LaShawn A. v. Barry, 87 F.3d 1389,\n1395 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc).  In Bame, the court applied the\ndoctrine of constitutional avoidance and did not decide whether\na Fourth Amendment violation occurred.  See Bame, 637 F.3d\nat 384 (citing Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009)); cf.\nOp. at 12.  Since Bame was decided the Supreme Court in\nCamreta v. Greene, ––– U.S. –––, 131 S. Ct. 2020 (2011), has\nunderscored the undesirability of the “flexibility,” Op. at 12,\nafforded to courts under Pearson v. Callahan to avoid deciding\nwhether  a  constitutional  violation  has  occurred  where  the\ndefendant is entitled to qualified immunity.  Not deciding the\nconstitutional question “threatens to leave standards of official\nconduct permanently in limbo.”  Camreta, 131 S. Ct. at 2031. \nBy proceeding directly to the immunity question, not only do\n“[c]ourts fail to clarify uncertain questions, fail to address novel\nclaims, fail to give guidance to officials about how to comply\nwith  legal  requirements,”  id.,  but  the  failure  to  decide\nconstitutional questions “may frustrate ‘the development of\nconstitutional precedent’ and the promotion of law-abiding\nbehavior,” id. (quoting Pearson, 555 U.S. at 237).  \n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 21 of 25\n2\nAlso since Bame, six Justices of the Supreme Court have\nexpressed unease with the type of indiscriminate strip searching\nengaged in by the Superior Court Marshal’s Office that is\nchallenged here and was challenged in Bame.  See Florence v.\nBd. of Chosen Freeholders of Cnty. of Burlington, ––– U.S. –––, \n132 S. Ct. 1510, 1523 (2012) (Roberts, CJ., concurring); id. at\n1524 (Alito, J., concurring); id. at 1525 (Breyer, J., joined by\nGinsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., dissenting).  The Supreme\nCourt’s expression of unease is not new, appearing even in the\ncontext of post-arraignment defendants held in the general\nprison population.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558 (1979)\n(“[T]his practice instinctively gives us the most pause.”).  \nNearly every other circuit court of appeals (and the District\nof Columbia’s highest court, see United States v. Scott, 987 A.2d\n1180, 1196–97 (D.C. 2010)) has understood that the humiliating\nand essentially non-productive practice of strip searching pre-\narraignment arrestees not held in the general population is an\nunreasonable  search  under  the  Fourth  Amendment  in  the\nabsence of reasonable suspicion.  See Bame, 637 F.3d at 391–92,\n395 (Rogers, J., dissenting) (citing cases from the First, Second,\nFourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh\nCircuit Courts of Appeals); see Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d\n1298, 1300–02 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc); Bull v. City and Cnty.\nof San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964, 980–81 (9th Cir. 2010) (en\nbanc).  The Third Circuit has yet to address the issue, rejecting\nonly a Fourth Amendment challenge to blanket strip searches\nupon arrestees admission to the general jail population.  See\nFlorence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Cnty. of Burlington,\n621 F.3d 296, 298–99, 311 (3d Cir. 2010).  Evidence before the\ncourts and in the instant case confirms that modern technology\nand law enforcement experience have shown that indiscriminate\nstrip  searching  of  non-violent,  non-drug  pre-arraignment\narrestees after the use of metal detectors and patdowns to locate\ncontraband rarely yields additional security benefits.  See, e.g.,\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 22 of 25\n3\nRoberts v. State of R.I., 239 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2001); see id.\n(citing cf. Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.3d 1263,\n1272–73  (7th  Cir.  1983));  Appellants’  Ex.  410  (compiling\nincident reports).  Contrary court findings involve the prison\nenvironment where smuggling of contraband “is all too common\nan occurrence” and deference is due to the policy judgments of\nprison administrators.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559; see also\nFlorence, 621 F.3d at 310. \nMembers of the Fourth Amendment class here were not\nbeing held in the general population with post-arraignment\narrestees and strip searches in their circumstances illustrate one\naspect of the Justices’ unease in Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1523,\n1524, 1525.  Applying the canon of constitutional avoidance in\nthis circuit is unwarranted, particularly in view of the recurring\ncourt challenges to indiscriminate strip searching by the U.S.\nMarshals Service in the Nation’s Capital, the frequent situs of\ndemonstrations as in Bame.  See Helton v. United States, 191 F.\nSupp. 2d 179 (D.D.C. 2002); Clifton v. United States, No. 02-\n0578 (D.D.C. Mar. 26, 2002); see also Morgan v. Dist. of\nColumbia, No. 81-1419 (D.D.C. July 22, 1981), applied in\nMorgan v. Barry, 596 F. Supp. 897, 898–99 (D.D.C. 1984).  The\nUnited  States  advises  that  the  U.S.  Marshals  Service  has\nabandoned the challenged strip searching policy and practice. \nSee Appellee Dillard Br. 59 n.17; Op. at 2.  This does not ensure\nthat the practice will not be revived, much less provide guidance\nfor new policies and practices, promote law-abiding behavior,\nor justify the court in not “clearly establish[ing]” that the Fourth\nAmendment rights of the appellant class were violated by the\nSuperior Court Marshal.  Joining the ten other circuit courts of\nappeals, I would hold that the indiscriminate strip searching of\nthe  Fourth  Amendment  class  in  the  absence  of  reasonable\nsuspicion violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 23 of 25\n4\nII.\nOtherwise, I generally agree that appellants’ claims fail.  \nA.  The Superior Court Marshal is a federal official who\nwas acting under color of federal law, and the District of\nColumbia cannot be held liable for the challenged actions of\nMarshal Dillard.  Op. at 9. \nSomewhat less persuasive is the District of Columbia’s\nsuggestion that it “had no choice,” Appellee D.C. Br. 41, not to\nturn  over  to  the  Superior  Court  Marshal  for  presentment\nindividuals arrested by the Metropolitan Police Department,\nregardless of whether the Marshal’s strip searching practices\nviolated the Fourth Amendment rights of non-violent, non-drug\npre-arraignment arrestees.  The District of Columbia can sue as\nwell as be sued, see D.C. Code § 1-102, and can seek the aid of\nthe courts to protect individuals in its custody.   Appellants point\nto  the  District  of  Columbia’s  obligation  to  ensure  the\nenforcement of the order in Morgan v. Barry, 596 F. Supp. 897,\n898 (D.D.C. 1984), that barred its own officers from strip\nsearching female arrestees housed at the District of Columbia\nDetention Facility in the absence of a “reasonable suspicion that\na weapon, contraband or evidence of a crime are concealed on\nthe person or in the clothing of the arrestee which the District [of\nColumbia]  or  its  agents  reasonably  believe  can  only  be\ndiscovered by a strip or squat search.”  Cf. Washington v. United\nStates, 594 A.2d 1050, 1052 (D.C. 1991) (quoting MPD Gen.\nOrder 502.1, Processing Prisoners 3, § B(5) barring body cavity\nsearches  of  arrestees  by  police  officers).    The  District  of\nColumbia  did  not  seek  such  aid  on  behalf  of  the  Fourth\nAmendment  class,  but  at  the  time  there  was  neither  an\noutstanding order with respect to the Superior Court Marshal,\nnor a decision by this court (or the D.C. Court of Appeals),\n“clearly establish[ing]” that blanket strip searching of pre-\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 24 of 25\n5\narraignment  arrestees  like  the  Fourth  Amendment  class  is\nunreasonable and a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\nB.  With regard to the constitutional challenges, because\nBame, 637 F.3d at 386, is the law of the circuit Marshal Dillard\nis entitled to qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment\nclaims.  Op. at 12.  Given appellants’ agreement that Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), is controlling at the summary\njudgment  stage  of  the  proceedings,  Op.  at  16,  the  Fifth\nAmendment claims fail for lack of evidence of a constitutional\nviolation.  Op. at 18.  \nIn that regard, the court observes that Marshal Dillard was\n“largely missing in action throughout the class period.”  Op. at\n16.  Although Dillard agreed that there was no reason to treat\nmale and female arrestees differently, see Dillard Dep. 77:1–7,\non his watch his deputies indiscriminately strip searched only\nwomen.  Op. at 3.  Summary judgment presents no occasion for\nthe court to weigh the evidence.   See Anderson v. Liberty\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).  A reasonable jury could\nfind that knowing acquiescence to continuing violations of a\nplaintiff’s Equal Protection rights by one’s deputies amounts to\npurposeful conduct and infer, in the absence of a legitimate non-\ninvidious reason for treating women differently than men, a\ndefendant’s  discriminatory  purpose.    Cf.  Vill.  of  Arlington\nHeights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266–67\n(1977); cf. also Primas v. Dist. of Columbia, 719 F.3d 693,\n697–98 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Evans v. Sebelius, 716 F.3d 617,\n620–22 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  Dillard repeatedly swore, however,\nthat he believed men and women were being strip searched in\nthe same manner, see Dillard Dep. 96:10–97:8, 99:8–101:12,\nand the Fifth Amendment class fails to proffer evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could find that he had a women-only\nstrip search policy or knew of the disparate treatment by his\ndeputies.  Op. at 16–18.  Absent evidence that Dillard either had\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC   Document 278-1   Filed 08/13/14   Page 25 of 25\n6\na blanket policy for strip searching only female arrestees, or\nknew that his deputies were doing so indiscriminately and did\nnothing to stop them, a discriminatory purpose by Dillard cannot\nreasonably be inferred.",

Plaintiffs bring this class action lawsuit on behalf of \nthemselves and all other women arrestees who 1) were subjected to \nblanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches while \nbeing held in the Superior Court Cell Block of the District of \nColumbia Superior Court, waiting for presentment before a judge \nor other judicial officer of the District of Columbia Superior \nCourt on charges brought under a District of Columbia statute \nthat were either a) a non-violent, non-drug related traffic \ncharge, b) a non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor charge, or \nc) a non-violent, non-drug related felony charge, or 2) were \nsubjected to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat \n  3\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 4 of 52(cid:10)\nsearches just before they were admitted to, or while being held \nin, the Superior Court Cell Block of the District of Columbia \nSuperior Court, while waiting for presentment before a judge or \nother judicial officer of the District of Columbia Superior Court \non charges brought under a District of Columbia statute \nregardless of the charges against them because similarly situated \nmen are not subjected to such searches.   \n2.  A “blanket” search means a search undertaken without making \nan individualized or categorical determination that reasonable \nsuspicion exists to justify the search.  \n3.  Although this amended complaint is written in the present \ntense, it refers to events that occurred before the last day of \nApril, 2003, when the federal defendants represented to the \nplaintiffs and the Court that they stopped the strip search \npractices described herein. \n4.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare two separate sub-\nclasses, as described below. \n5.  Plaintiffs Dianna Johnson, Rubbiya Muhammad, Carolyn \nMontgomery, Tonya Cecelia Mack and Laura Lambert (the “Fourth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs”) are women arrestees arrested under a \nDistrict of Columbia statute, on a) non-violent, non-drug related \ntraffic charges, b) non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor \ncharges, or c)non-violent, non-drug related felony charges who \nwere subjected to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat \n  4\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 5 of 52(cid:10)\nsearches without any individualized finding of reasonable \nsuspicion or probable cause that they were concealing drugs, \nweapons or other contraband, by United States Marshals at the \nDistrict of Columbia Superior Courthouse, just before they were \nheld in the Superior Court Cell Block waiting for presentment \nbefore a judge or other judicial officer of the District of \nColumbia Superior Court.  \n6.  The great majority of the “Fourth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs” and the class members were released from custody \nafter presentment directly from the presentment courtroom either \nbecause their cases were no-papered or because they were released \non personal recognizance.  The Fourth Amendment class does not \napply to those who were returned to jail custody because they had \nbail set that they were unable to post or were detained on the \ncharges on which they were presented or other charges such that \nthey were properly processed into the general jail population for \ncontinued detention and were subjected to visual body cavity or \nsquat searches prior to being processed into the general jail \npopulation at the DC Jail or the Correctional Treatment Facility. \n7.  The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs base their claims on \nthe Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits \nsubjecting persons arrested on traffic, misdemeanor or felony non \ndrug, non violent offenses to strip and squat searches without an \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause \n  5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 6 of 52(cid:10)\nthat the person was concealing drugs, weapons or other \ncontraband. \n8.  Plaintiffs Dianna Johnson, Rubbiya Muhammad, Carolyn \nMontgomery, Tonya Cecelia Mack, Laura Lambert, Dianne Wilkes, \nVickie Brooks, Keisha Holloway and Donna Curtis (the “Fifth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs”) are women arrestees arrested on all \ntypes of District of Columbia charges, including drug and violent \noffenses, who were subjected to blanket strip, visual body cavity \nand/or squat searches, by United States Marshals at the District \nof Columbia Superior Courthouse, while held in the Superior Court \nCell Block waiting for presentment before a judge or other \njudicial officer of the District of Columbia Superior Court on a \ncharge brought under a District of Columbia statute.  Defendants \nsubject women arrestees to such searches, but do not subject \nsimilarly situated men arrestees, including men charged with drug \nand violent offenses, to them.  \n9.  The great majority of the “Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs” \nand the class members are released from custody after presentment \ndirectly from the presentment courtroom either because their \ncases are no-papered or because they are released on personal \nrecognizance.  The Fourth Amendment class does not apply to those \nwho were returned to jail custody because they had bail set that \nthey were unable to post or were detained on the charges on which \nthey were presented or other charges such that they were properly \n  6\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 7 of 52(cid:10)\nprocessed into the general jail population for continued \ndetention and were subjected to visual body cavity or squat \nsearches prior to being processed into the general jail \npopulation. \n10.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs base their claims on \nthe equal protection component of the due process clause of the \nFifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which \nprohibits treating similarly situated men and women differently \nbased on their gender.   \n11.  As used herein, “presentment” refers to the initial \nproceeding before the Court referred to in Rule 5 of the Superior \nCourt Rules of Criminal Procedure. \n12.  Violent offense means any of the offenses defined as a \n“crime of violence” in D.C. Code § 23-1331(4) as defined under \nTitle 22 of the D.C. Code, misdemeanor simple assault, D.C.

Traffic and District of Columbia offenses means any offense \nprosecuted by the Corporation Counsel’s Office of the District of \nColumbia.   \n15.  Superior Court Cell Block as used herein includes not only \nthe lock up behind Superior Court Courtroom C-10, but also the \nlock up behind the courtroom where presentments are held for \npersons arrested on traffic offenses, if strip, squat and visual \nbody cavity searches are held there, and also the hallway leading \nto the Superior Court Cell Block where the searches described \nherein actually occur. \n16.  The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action \nagainst the Government of the District of Columbia, Todd Dillard \nin his individual capacity, and Does 1-10, in their individual \ncapacities, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of \n1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce their Fourth Amendment Rights.  \nAlternatively, the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this \naction against Todd Dillard, in his individual capacity, and Does \n1-10 in their individual capacities, directly under the Fourth \nAmendment to the Constitution.  The Fourth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs bring this action against the United States Marshals \nService directly under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. \n17.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action \nagainst the Government of the District of Columbia, Todd Dillard \nin his individual capacity, and Does 11-20, in their individual \n  8\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 9 of 52(cid:10)\ncapacities, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of \n1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce their Fifth Amendment Rights.  \nAlternatively, the Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this \naction against Todd Dillard, in his individual capacity, and John \nDoes 11-20, in their individual capacities, directly under the \nFifth Amendment to the Constitution.  The Fifth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs bring this action against the United States Marshals \nService directly under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) because plaintiffs’ \nclaims are based on Section 1983 and the Constitution. \n19.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  The claim for relief \narose in this judicial district. \nFourth Amendment Class Action Allegations \n20.  The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action \nunder Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of each woman \nwho, in the three years preceding the filing of this action, up \nuntil the date this case is terminated (“the class period”), was \nor will be, (i) while being held or just before being put in the \nSuperior Court Cell Block; (ii) for presentment under a statute \nof the District of Columbia; on either (iii)(a) a non drug, non \n  9\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 10 of 52(cid:10)\nviolent traffic offense; (iii)(b) a non drug, non violent \nmisdemeanor; or (iii)(c) a non drug, non violent felony; (iv) was \nsubjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity search and/or \nsquat search without any individualized finding of reasonable \nsuspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs, \nweapons or other contraband.  \n21.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate because defendants District of \nColumbia and the United States Marshals Service and the other \ndefendants have a policy and engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and \ninjunctive relief against Defendants will benefit each and every \nplaintiff and class member. \n22.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating \nthe above described policy of blanket searches not based on \nindividualized or particularized suspicion or probable cause. \n23.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(3) is also appropriate, in that common questions \nof law and fact predominate over any individual questions, and a \nclass action is superior for the fair and efficient adjudication \nof this controversy as detailed below.  \n24.  Regarding the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs, and members \nof the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of \nliability, because every woman arrestee held in the Superior \n  10\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 11 of 52(cid:10)\nCourt Cell Block is subjected to the blanket searches, and none \nof the defendants keeps records of the searches and therefore \nnone of the defendants can show that any of the searches were \nconducted based on an individual determination of reasonable \nsuspicion.  Should records exist demonstrating any searches were \ndone pursuant to such individualized suspicion, such people \nwould, by definition, not be members of the class. \n25.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na. whether Defendant District of Columbia and the United \nStates Marshals Service have a policy, custom and \npractice of subjecting female arrestees being held in \nthe Superior Court Cell Block pending presentment to \nblanket strip, visual body cavity searches and/or squat \nsearches without an individualized determination that \nthe woman was in possession of drugs, weapons or other \ncontraband; \nb. whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the \nFourth Amendment; \nc. whether the individual defendants were deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of such women arrestees; \nd. whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of \nsuch damages;  \n  11\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 12 of 52(cid:10)\ne. whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and \nfuture members are entitled to equitable relief, and, \nif so, what is the nature of that relief; and \nf. whether determination of damages suffered by a \nstatistically representative sample of the class \nprovides the basis for determination of all class \nmembers’ damages except those who opt out. \n26.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.  The exact number of class members is unknown to \nplaintiffs at this time, but is likely to consist of at least \nmany hundreds of people. \n27.  Every week at least 10 women meeting the Fourth Amendment \nclass definition are held in the Superior Court Cell Block \npending presentment and subject to the illegal searches.  Thus \nthis class well exceeds 1000 members. \n28.  Defendant District of Columbia has within its records the \nnames and addresses of all the current and past class members in \nthe “CJIS” computer system (computerized booking program used by \nDistrict of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department described \nbelow). \n29.  The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of \nthe claims of the other members of the class, because the Fourth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and all other members of the class \n  12\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 13 of 52(cid:10)\nwere injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the blanket \nsearches. \n30.  The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and \nhave retained counsel who are competent and experienced in \ncomplex federal civil rights class action litigation and/or \ncomplex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n31.  The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs have no interests that \nare contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n32.  The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty \nthat will be encountered in the management of this litigation \nthat would preclude its maintenance as a class action, and the \nclass action is superior to any other available means to resolve \nthe issues raised on behalf of the Fourth Amendment Class.  The \nclass action will be manageable because so many different records \nsystems exist from which to ascertain the members of the putative \nclass.  For example, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police \nDepartment maintains “CJIS”, a computerized booking system that \ncaptures the name, address, charge, date of charge, date of \npresentment and post presentment custody status, for every \narrestee, and the District of Columbia Superior Court maintains \n“CIS”, a computer database that captures the name, address, \ncharge, date of charge, date of presentment, docket number and \npost presentment custody status disposition for every arrestee.  \n  13\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 14 of 52(cid:10)\nClass treatment will be superior because liability can be \ndetermined on a class wide basis, and damages can also be \ndetermined on a class wide basis through use of statistical \nsampling. \nFifth Amendment Class Action Allegations \n33.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of each woman \nwho, in the three years preceding the filing of this action, up \nuntil the date this case is terminated (“the class period”), was \nor will be, (i) while in the Superior Court Cell Block or just \nbefore being put in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) being \nheld for presentment subject to a statute of the District of \nColumbia; (iii) under similar circumstances as men arrestees; \n(iv) subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or \nsquat search. \n34.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate, because defendants District of \nColumbia and the United States Marshals Service and the other \ndefendants have a policy and engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and \ninjunctive relief against Defendants will benefit each and every \nplaintiff and class member. \n  14\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 15 of 52(cid:10)\n35.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating \nthe searches. \n36.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(3) is also appropriate, in that common questions \nof law and fact predominate over any individual questions, and a \nclass action is superior for the fair and efficient adjudication \nof this controversy as detailed below.  \n37.  Regarding the Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs, and members \nof the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of \nliability, because every woman arrestee held in the Superior \nCourt Cell Block is subjected to the blanket searches, and none \nof the defendants keeps records of the searches and therefore \nnone of the defendants can show that any of the searches were \nconducted based on an individual determination of reasonable \nsuspicion.  Should records exist demonstrating any searches were \ndone pursuant to such individualized suspicion, such people \nwould, by definition, not be members of the class. \n38.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na. whether Defendant District of Columbia and the United \nStates Marshals Service have a policy or custom and \npractice of subjecting female arrestees being held in \nthe Superior Court Cell Block pending presentment to \nblanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat \n  15\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 16 of 52(cid:10)\nsearches, but not subjecting men arrestees to such \nsearches; \nb. whether the policy of strip searching women arrestees \nserves any legitimate penological interest; \nc. whether classification of similarly situated men and \nwomen arrestees into classes based on gender bears any \nrelationship to defendants’ asserted penological \ninterest; \nd. whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the \nFifth Amendment; \ne. whether the individual defendants were deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of such women arrestees; \nf. whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of \nsuch damages; and \ng. whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and \nfuture members are entitled to equitable relief, and, \nif so, what is the nature of that relief; and \nh. whether determination of damages suffered by a \nstatistically representative sample of the class \nprovides the basis for determination of all class \nmembers except those who opt out. \n  16\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 17 of 52(cid:10)\n39.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.  The exact number of class members is unknown to \nplaintiffs at this time, but is likely to consist of at least \nseveral thousands of people. \n40.  Every week at least seventy-five women meeting the Fifth \nAmendment class definition are held in the Superior Court Cell \nBlock pending presentment and subject to the illegal searches. \n41.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of \nthe claims of the other members of the class, because the Fifth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and all other members of the class \nwere injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the blanket \nsearches. \n42.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and \nhave retained counsel who are competent and experienced in \ncomplex federal civil rights class action litigation and/or \ncomplex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n43.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs have no interests that \nare contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n44.  The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty \nthat will be encountered in the management of this litigation \nthat would preclude its maintenance as a class action, and the \nclass action is superior to any other available means to resolve \n  17\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 18 of 52(cid:10)\nthe issues raised on behalf of the Fifth Amendment Class.  The \nclass action will be manageable because so many different records \nsystems exist from which to ascertain the members of the putative \nclass.  For example, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police \nDepartment maintains “CJIS”, a computerized booking system that \ncaptures the name, address, charge, date of charge and date of \npresentment for every arrestee, and the District of Columbia \nSuperior Court maintains “CIS”, a computer database that captures \nthe name, address, charge, date of charge, date of presentment, \ndocket number and disposition for every arrestee.  Class \ntreatment will be superior because liability can be determined on \na class wide basis, and damages can also be determined on a class \nwide basis through use of statistical sampling. \n45.  Defendant District of Columbia has within its computerized \nrecords described above the names and addresses of all the \ncurrent and past class members. \nPARTIES \n46.

Defendant United States Marshals Service is an agency of the \nfederal government located in Washington, DC, and is jointly \nresponsible with Defendant District of Columbia for planning and \nimplementing the strip, visual body cavity and squat searches of \nwomen arrestees described below in this Complaint.  In the \ncontext of the facts of this complaint, it operates as an agent \nof the District of Columbia, as is more fully explained below.  \n  19\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 20 of 52(cid:10)\n57.

Every person who is arrested in the District of Columbia \npursuant to a statute or warrant of the District of Columbia and \nwho is taken to the District of Columbia Superior Court for \npresentment before a judge or other judicial officer of the \nDistrict of Columbia is held in a designated area of the Superior \nCourt Courthouse called the Superior Court Cell Block pending \npresentment. \n61.  The Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Superior Court \ncontrols the disposition of the space at the District of Columbia \nSuperior Court, including areas where arrestees and other \nprisoners are held.  For example, by Superior Court \n  20\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 21 of 52(cid:10)\nAdministrative Order 02-14 he authorized the MPD to use Cellblock \nB as a booking center the day of the IMF protests in 2002. \n62.  The District of Columbia through Chief Judge King also has \ncontrol of the prisoners in the Superior Court courthouse. \n63.  Every person held in the Superior Court Cell Block pending \npresentment who has been arrested either on a District of \nColumbia warrant or on suspicion of violation of a District of \nColumbia statute is held in the joint custody of the United \nStates Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia \n(Todd Dillard) and the Government of the District of Columbia. \n64.  Chief Judge King in 2002 issued an administrative order \nordering that Marshals cannot remove in-custody defendants from \nthe Superior Court courtrooms until after the judges and \ncourtroom staff have completed appropriate paperwork, and \nfurther, Marshals cannot return in-custody defendants to the DC \nJail unless the Marshals have all his paperwork in all of his \ncases.  Chief Judge King’s Administrative Order 02-22, dated July \n25, 2002. \n65.  The Superior Court of the District of Columbia is an agency \nof the Government of the District of Columbia. \n66.  Defendant Todd Dillard as the United States Marshal for the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia derives his authority \nover women arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block pursuant to \nstatutes of the District of Columbia, including D.C. Code §§ 13-\n  21\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 22 of 52(cid:10)\n302, 16-703, 23-501, 23-561, 23-563 and 23-581 and cooperative \nagreements entered into between the United States Marshals \nService and the Government of the District of Columbia pursuant \nto D.C. Code § 5-133.17. \n67.  Defendant District of Columbia pays every year for some or \nall of the costs of operation, maintenance and repair of space \nused by the United States Marshals Service at the District of \nColumbia Superior Court Courthouse.  \n68.  Defendant District of Columbia pays every year for some or \nall of the costs incurred by the United States Marshals Service \nin performing their duties at the District of Columbia Superior \nCourt Courthouse.   \n69.  The United States Marshal for the Superior Court and his \ndeputies act as the agents of the Defendant District of Columbia \npursuant to District of Columbia statutes, policies and/or \npractices while holding arrestees in the Superior Court Cell \nBlock and other areas of the Superior Court Courthouse. \n70.  Upon arrest, persons arrested in the District of Columbia \nare held at one of the seven District “stations” before transport \nto Central Cellblock (the District of Columbia Metropolitan \nPolice (“MPD”) lock-up for holding arrestees) or are taken \ndirectly to Central Cellblock. \n  22\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 23 of 52(cid:10)\n71.  MPD Officers transport the women arrestees from the District \nstations or the MPD Central Cellblock by van to the Superior \nCourt. \n72.  Each van load of prisoners has a manifest (“van sheet”} \nlisting the names and arrest charges of each of the women \narrestees on the van. \n73.  The arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block have been \nsubjected to pat down searches by the transporting police \nofficers before being transported to the Superior Court Cell \nBlock by the MPD. \n74.  Any person who is transported to the Superior Court Cell \nBlock from any of the seven District of Columbia Metropolitan \nPolice Department patrol districts or the District of Columbia \nMetropolitan Police Department’s Central Cell Block has been \nsubjected to a thorough pat down at the patrol station or the \nDistrict of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department Central Cell \nBlock before being transported to Superior Court Cell Block. \n75.  The only persons housed in the Superior Court Cell Block \ndesignated for arrestees are arrestees brought to the Superior \nCourt Courthouse for presentment to a judicial officer of the \nDistrict of Columbia on a charge of violating a District of \nColumbia statute. \n  23\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 24 of 52(cid:10)\n76.  The great majority of women arrestees are released directly \nfrom the Superior Court Courthouse after presentment either \nbecause their cases are no-papered or they are released on \npersonal recognizance. The Fourth and Fifth Amendment classes do \nnot encompass those who were returned to jail custody because \nthey had bail set that they were unable to post or were detained \non the charges on which they were presented or other charges such \nthat they were properly processed into the general jail \npopulation for continued detention and were subjected to visual \nbody cavity or squat searches prior to being processed into the \ngeneral jail population. \n77.  25% to 35% of women arrestees have their cases “no-papered” \nthat is the prosecuting agency rejects the charges completely. \n78.  Many women arrestees arrested on felony charges have their \ncharges “papered down” to a misdemeanor before presentment. \n79.  Women and men arrestees who are denied bail at presentment \nand ordered to the jail and women and arrestees who are held \npending trial are transported in vans and buses from the Superior \nCourt Courthouse to the DC Jail. They are not intermingled with \npre-presentment women arrestees. \n80.  There is no “general population” at the Superior Court Cell \nBlock. \n  24\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 25 of 52(cid:10)\n81.  Other prisoners at the Superior Court Courthouse are not \nintermingled with the arrestees prior to the search. \n82.  Men arrestees and women arrestees brought to the Superior \nCourt Courthouse are segregated by sex, and the men and women are \nheld separately in separate areas in the Superior Court Cell \nBlock. \n83.  The United States Marshal for the Superior Court, and his \ndeputies, follow a policy and custom of subjecting, upon their \nadmission to the Superior Court Cell Block, all women arrestees \nto blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches \nwithout a particularized finding of reasonable suspicion that the \nwoman arrestee is in possession of weapons, drugs or other \ncontraband. \n84.  Agents of the Marshals Service actually physically conduct \nthe visual body cavity and squat searches of the women arrestees \nin a hallway as the women are dropped off by the MPD transport \nofficers on the way to the the Superior Court Cell Block.  \n85.  Agents of the District of Columbia, including the United \nStates Marshal for the Superior Court and his deputies, do not \nsubject men arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block awaiting \npresentment to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat \nsearches. \n  25\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 26 of 52(cid:10)\n86.  The search procedure conducted on the women arrestees in the \nSuperior Court Cell Block is as follows: \n87.  When women arrestees are transported to the Superior Court \nCell Block, a female United States Marshals conducts full body \npat down searches on them from head to toe. \n88.  A female Marshal then makes the women arrestees take off \ntheir shoes and shake them out. \n89.  A female Marshal then directs the arrestees to pull up her \nskirt or to lower her pants and to pull down any undergarments.   \n90.  A female Marshal then makes the arrestees squat and turn \naround and display their buttocks and their genitals to the \nfemale Marshal. \n91.  The Marshals stand just a few feet away from the women \narrestees as they do the searches. \n92.  The searches are conducted in front of all the women \narrestees already in the hallway leading from the reception area \nto the Superior Court Cell Block. \n93.  There is no dedicated searching area. \n94.  The MPD transport officers mingle with the women arrestees \nand the US Marshals near the sally port and are aware of the \nstrip/body cavity/squat searches. \n  26\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 27 of 52(cid:10)\n95.  The searching officers could look at the van sheets to make \nindividualized determinations of the need for searches based on \nthe nature of the charge but they do not. \n96.  Each arrestee coming in from MPD has a plastic wrist band \non.  The Marshals, as they receive the arrestees, mark the level \nof the charge on the wrist band in black marker (“D” for District \ncharge, “T” for traffic charge, “V” for domestic violence, “M” \nfor misdemeanor and “F” for felony). \n97.  The Marshals subject the women arrestees to very thorough \nsearches upon their arrival at the Superior Courthouse. \n98.  First, the Marshals make women arrestees pass metal \ndetectors upon their arrival at the Superior Court Courthouse. \n99.  Also, after the women pass the metal detectors, the Marshals \nperform thorough pat down searches on the women arrestees, check \ntheir hair, wig, hairpiece or hat, and remove and inspect coats \nand shoes. \n100.  During the pat down searches the Marshals also search the \nwaistband areas, the pockets, the leg areas, the feet and the \nshoes of the women arrestees. \n101.  The Marshals then subject women arrestees at the Superior \nCourt Cellblock to strip and squat and visual body cavity \nsearches in which the women drop their pants or lift their \nskirts, take down their undergarments, and squat and cough. \n  27\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 28 of 52(cid:10)\n102.  The Marshals perform the strip/squat/visual body cavity \nsearches described above on every single woman arrestee, without \nexception, and regardless of her charge or her appearance \n103.  The searches are public, humiliating, and degrading and \ncause emotional and psychic injury to the women arrestees. \n104.  The practice of the searches is not supported by a \ndocumented history of contraband smuggling at the Superior Court \nCell Block. \n105.  The practice of the searches is not justified by a \nlegitimate security interest. \n106.  Other less invasive means of searching the women arrestees \nexist, such as thorough pat downs, electronic screeners and hand \nheld “wands” or scanners, or drug detection canines.  \n107.  After the Marshals conduct the strip, squat and visual body \ncavity searches on the women arrestees, the Marshals put the \nwomen in the Superior Court Cell Block and allow them to have \nunsupervised visits with attorneys before they enter the \ncourtroom for presentment. \n108.  The attorneys and the women arrestees are separated only by \ngrills that have 4 inch by 12 inch slots in the grill work for \nitems and paperwork to be passed through. \n  28\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 29 of 52(cid:10)\n109.  United States Marshals Service employees including Does 1-10 \nand Does 11-20 participated in making and implementing the policy \nof subjecting women arrestees to the above-described searches. \n110.  Defendant District of Columbia employees participated in \nmaking and implementing the policy of subjecting women arrestees \nto the above-described searches and acquiesce in and facilitate \nthe practice. \n111.  Before instituting the current practice of holding women \narrestees at the District stations or Central Cellblock before \nbringing them to the Superior Court for presentment, the District \nfollowed a practice of committing arrestees to the DC Jail and \nholding them there till they were transported to the Superior \nCourt for presentment. \n112.  At that time (in the 1980s and 1990s) the District followed \na practice of subjecting all women arrestees committed to the DC \nJail awaiting transport to the courthouse for presentment \n{“police cases”} to visual body cavity strip searches. \n113.  On July 22, 1981 The Honorable Audrey Robinson of this Court \nentered on Order (“Morgan Order”) which directed, among other \nthings, that the District of Columbia not conduct strip or squat \nsearches of female police cases housed at the District of \nColumbia Detention Facility [DC Jail] in the absence of a \n\"reasonable suspicion that a weapon, contraband or evidence of a \ncrime are concealed on the person or in the clothing of the \n  29\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 30 of 52(cid:10)\narrestee which the District or its agents reasonably believe can \nonly be discovered by a strip or squat search.\"  Morgan v. Barry, \n596 F. Supp. 897, 898 (D.D.C. 1984). \n114.  The Honorable Audrey Robinson entered an Order on October \n29, 1985 continuing the Morgan Order (and another order) “for an \nindefinite period of time”.  Morgan v. Barry, 81-cv-1419, Docket \nEntry No. 82, 1985 (docket sheet).  The orders remain in effect. \n115.  The Morgan Order and other orders impose on the District of \nColumbia an obligation to ensure that the District of Columbia \nprotect female arrestees from blanket strip searches before \npresentment regardless of where the female arrestees are \ncommitted before presentment. \n116.  The Morgan Order and other orders impose on the District of \nColumbia an obligation to ensure that anyone to whom the District \nof Columbia entrusts its female arrestees also protect the \nDistrict’s female arrestees from blanket strip searches before \npresentment regardless of where the female arrestees are \ncommitted before presentment. \n117.  The Morgan Order and other orders impose on the District of \nColumbia an obligation to monitor the conduct of persons to whom \nthe District of Columbia entrusts its female arrestees to ensure \nthey are protected from blanket strip searches before presentment \nregardless of where the female arrestees are committed before \npresentment. \n  30\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 31 of 52(cid:10)\n118.  The District of Columbia remained and remains obligated \nunder the Morgan Order and other orders to ensure that Todd \nDillard and the Marshals protect the female arrestees from \nblanket strip searches while the Marshals have physical custody \nof the District’s prisoners. \n119.  The Morgan Order and other orders impose on Todd Dillard and \nthe Marshals a duty to familiarize themselves with laws and \norders which protect the District’s female arrestees from blanket \nstrip searches before presentment regardless of where the female \narrestees are committed before presentment. \n120.  The Government of the District of Columbia knows , and knew \nat all times within the class period,  that women arrestees would \nbe subjected to blanket searches in the Superior Court Cell Block \nand the Government of the District of Columbia acquiesces in the \nsearches. \n121.  Agents of the District of Columbia regularly mingle at the \nSuperior Court courthouse with the Marshals and the arrestees and \nknow, and knew at all times within the class period, about the \nsearches. \n122.  Many female District of Columbia employees have been \narrested and undergone the strip searches during the class \nperiod. \n  31\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 32 of 52(cid:10)\n123.  The Government of the District of Columbia has during the \nclass period had actual or constructive knowledge that the United \nStates Marshals Service subjected women arrestees to the strip \nsearches complained of herein. \n124.  The Government of the District of Columbia knowingly and as \npart of its practice, policy, and custom, nonetheless transferred \nwomen arrestees in its custody to the custody of United States \nMarshals Service, causing each member of the Classes to be \nsubjected to the strip searches. \n125.  The Government of the District of Columbia has an \naffirmative duty to protect arrestees from harm, including the \nrisk of violations of constitutional rights by a third party to \nwhom the arrestees are transferred, particularly in areas and on \nissues where court orders requiring it respect certain \nconstitutional rights have been issued. \n126.  The Government of the District of Columbia has never \nprotested the searches before the filing of the original \ncomplaint in this case.  \n127.  The District of Columbia failed to take any affirmative act \nreasonably calculated to protect arrested persons in its custody \nand prevent unconstitutional strip searches. \n128.  The District of Columbia delegated its duties to the United \nStates Marshals Service but failed to train the Marshals in strip \nsearch polices even though the need for training was obvious. \n  32\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 33 of 52(cid:10)\n129.  The constitutional violations that resulted are foreseeable \nbecause of the District’s failure to train. \n130.  Every person who has been arrested either on a District of \nColumbia warrant or on suspicion of violation of a District of \nColumbia statute was arrested by a person acting under color of \nDistrict of Columbia law and engaging in state action.  D.C. Code \n§ 23-561; D.C. Code § 23-581. \n131.  Every person held in the Superior Court Cell Block pending \npresentment who has been arrested either on a District of \nColumbia warrant or on suspicion of violation of a District of \nColumbia statute is held by a person acting under color of \nDistrict of Columbia law and engaging in state action. \n132.  Defendant Todd Dillard, as the United States Marshal for the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia, derives his authority \nover women arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block pursuant to \nstatutes of the District of Columbia, including D.C. Code §§ 13-\n302, 16-703, 23-501, 23-561, 23-563 and 23-581 and cooperative \nagreements entered into between the United States Marshals \nService and the government of the District of Columbia pursuant \nto D.C. Code § 5-133.17, and the authority of the Chief Judge \nacting in an administrative capacity for the District of \nColumbia. \n133.  At all times described herein Defendant Todd Dillard and \nDoes 1-10 and Does 11-20 were acting under color of District of \n  33\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 34 of 52(cid:10)\nColumbia law and they were acting pursuant to the policy, custom \nand practice of Defendant District of Columbia. \nNAMED PLAINTIFFS ARRESTED ON TRAFFIC OFFENSES \n134.

The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs reallege and \nincorporate by reference all allegations set forth above in this \nComplaint. \n  40\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 41 of 52(cid:10)\n172.  While being held for presentment in the Superior Court Cell \nBlock each of the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and every \nother class member were subjected to a strip, visual body cavity \nsearch and/or squat search without an individual determination \nthat the search would reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband, \npursuant to a custom, policy and/or practice of Marshal Dillard, \nthe United States Marshal’s Service, and the District of Columbia \n– each of which is jointly and severally liable and responsible \nfor such policy, custom and/or practice - to conduct such \nsearches. \n173.  Subjecting an arrestee arrested on a non drug, non violent \noffense to a strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat search \nwithout an individual determination that the search would reveal \nweapons, drugs or other contraband violates her Fourth Amendment \nRights. \n174.  The Defendants knew that the Fourth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs and other class members would be subject to the \nsearches in the Superior Court Cell Block and acquiesced in the \nsearches. \n175.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, \ndirectly and proximately and affirmatively were the moving force \nbehind the violations of the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs \nand the class members’ Fourth Amendment Rights. \n  41\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 42 of 52(cid:10)\n176.  Defendant District of Columbia and the United States \nMarshals Service’s policy, custom and practice described above \nwere the moving force behind the deprivations to the Fourth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs’ and other class members’ Fourth \nAmendment Rights and the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and \nthe other class members’ injuries as described above. \n177.  Defendants caused the unreasonable strip, visual body cavity \nsearch and/or squat searches of the Fourth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members by deliberate indifference \nto the risk of constitutional injury by maintaining and/or \nacquiescing in a policy and practice and custom of strip \nsearching women arrestees. \n178.  At all relevant times District of Columbia and United States \nMarshal Service employees were acting within the scope of their \nemployment, their acts were motivated by a desire to further the \ninterests of the District of Columbia and the United States \nMarshals Service, and such employees were acting in furtherance \nof the business of the District of Columbia and the United States \nMarshals Service. \n179.  In developing, implementing and participating in the custom, \npolicy, practice and conduct complained of herein, Marshal Todd \nDillard was acting as an agent and delegated policy maker of the \nDistrict of Columbia. Similarly, members of the Marshal’s \nService, acting under Marshal Dillard’s supervision and direction \n  42\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 43 of 52(cid:10)\nin developing, implementing and participating in the custom, \npolicy, practice and conduct complained of herein, were acting as \nagents of the District of Columbia. \n180.  Defendant District of Columbia and Defendant Todd Dillard \nand Does 1-10 are therefore liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for \nconstitutional injuries to the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs \nand all other class members caused by their conduct. \nCount 2 \nDirect Liability of the United States Marshals Service and Todd \nDillard (the United States Marshal for the Superior Court) and \nthe United States Marshal Service employees Does 1-10 for \nViolation of Fourth Amendment Rights of Fourth Amendment \nPlaintiffs for Illegal Searches \n181.  The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs reallege and \nincorporate by reference all allegations set forth above in this \nComplaint.  \n182.  Each of the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs was arrested \nby officers of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police \nDepartment under the authority of a District of Columbia statute \nand held for presentment before a District of Columbia Superior \nCourt Judge or other judicial officer in the Superior Court Cell \nBlock and was actually presented before a District of Columbia \n  43\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 44 of 52(cid:10)\nSuperior Court Judge or other judicial officer in a courtroom in \nthe District of Columbia Superior Court.  \n183.  At all times that each of the Fourth Amendment Named \nPlaintiffs and every other class member was in the Superior Court \nCell Block, she was in the joint custody of one or more agents of \nthe Government of the United States and the United States \nMarshals Service and the District of Columbia. \n184.  While in the Superior Court Cell Block, each of the Fourth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and every other class member was \nsubjected to a strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat \nsearch by an agent of the United States Marshals Service without \nan individual determination that the search would reveal weapons, \ndrugs or other contraband. \n185.  Defendant United States Marshals Service and Defendant Todd \nDillard and Does 1-10 violated the Fourth Amendment rights of the \nFourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs by establishing and \nimplementing the search policies described above.  \n186.  The United States Marshals Service and Defendant Todd \nDillard and Does 1-10 are therefore directly liable under the \nFourth Amendment for constitutional injuries to the Fourth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and all other class members caused by \ntheir conduct. \n  44\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 45 of 52(cid:10)\nCLAIMS OF FIFTH AMENDMENT NAMED PLAINTIFFS  \nCount 3 \nLiability of Defendants for Violation of Fifth Amendment Rights \nof Fifth Amendment Plaintiffs for Illegal Searches under § 1983 \n187.

While in the Superior Court Cell Block each of the Fifth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and every other class member were \nsubjected to a visual body cavity search and squat search, \npursuant to a custom, policy and/or practice of Marshal Dillard, \nthe United States Marshal’s Service, and the District of Columbia \n– each of which is jointly and severally liable and responsible \nfor such policy, custom and/or practice - to conduct such \nsearches. \n189.  While in the Superior Court Cell Block each of the Fifth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and every other class member, was \nsimilarly situated to every male arrestee. \n190.

The classification of arrestees into classes based on gender \nbears no relationship to defendants’ asserted penological \ninterest. \n192.  Defendants knew that the Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs \nand other class members would be subject to the above-described \nsearches in the Superior Court Cell Block and acquiesced in the \nsearches. \n193.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, \ndirectly and proximately and affirmatively were the moving force \nbehind the violations of the Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and \nthe class members’ Fifth Amendment Rights. \n194.  Defendant District of Columbia and the United States \nMarshals Service’s policy, custom and practice described above \nwere the moving force behind the deprivations to the Fifth \nAmendment Named Plaintiffs’ and other class members’ Fifth \nAmendment Rights. \n195.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, \ndirectly and proximately caused, and was the moving force behind \nthe Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs and the other class members’ \ninjuries as described above. \n196.  District of Columbia and United States Marshal Service \nemployees caused the unreasonable strip, visual body cavity \nsearch and/or squat searches of the Fifth Amendment Named \n  46\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 47 of 52(cid:10)\nPlaintiffs and all other class members by deliberate indifference \nto the risk of constitutional injury by maintaining and/or \nacquiescing in a policy and practice of strip searching women \narrestees. \n197.  At all relevant times such District of Columbia and United \nStates Marshal Service employees were acting within the scope of \ntheir employment, their acts were motivated by a desire to \nfurther the interests of the District of Columbia and the United \nStates Marshals Service, and such employees were acting in \nfurtherance of the business of the District of Columbia and the \nUnited States Marshals Service. \n198.  In developing, implementing and participating in the custom, \npolicy, practice and conduct complained of herein, Marshal Todd \nDillard was acting as an agent and delegated policy maker of the \nDistrict of Columbia. Similarly, members of the Marshal’s \nService, acting under Marshal Dillard’s supervision and direction \nin developing, implementing and participating in the custom, \npolicy, practice and conduct complained of herein, were acting as \nagents of the District of Columbia. \n199.  Defendant District of Columbia and Defendant Todd Dillard \nand Does 11-20 are therefore liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for \nconstitutional injuries to the Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs \nand all other class members caused by them. \nCount 4 \n  47\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 58-1     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 48 of 52(cid:10)\nDirect Liability of the United States Marshals Service and Todd \nDillard and Does 11-20 for Violation of Fifth Amendment Rights of \nFifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs \n200.

The visual body cavity and squat searches of the women \narrestees do not serve any legitimate penological interest. \n202.  The classification of arrestees into classes based on gender \nbears no relationship to defendants’ asserted penological \ninterest. \n203.

Plaintiffs bring this class action lawsuit on behalf of\nthemselves and all other women arrestees who 1) were subjected to\nblanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches while\nbeing held in the Superior Court Cell Block of the District of\nColumbia Superior Court, waiting for presentment before a judge\nor other judicial officer of the District of Columbia Superior\nCourt on charges brought under a District of Columbia statute\nthat were either a) a non-violent, non-drug related traffic\ncharge, b) a non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor charge, or\nc) a non-violent, non-drug related felony charge, or 2) were\nsubjected to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat\nsearches while being held in the Superior Court Cell Block of the\n3\n\no\n..\nDistrict of Columbia Superior Court, waiting for presentment\nbefore a judge or other judicial officer of the District of\nColumbia Superior Court on charges brought under a District of\nColumbia statute regardless of the charges against them Decause\nsimilarly situated men are not subjected to such searches.\n2. Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare two separate sub-\nclasses, as described below.\n3. Plaintiffs Dianna Johnson, Rubbiya Muhammad, Carolyn\nMontgomery, Tanya Cecelia Mack and Laura Lambert (the \"Fourth\nAmendment Named Plaintiffs\") are women arrestees arrested under a\nDistrict of Columbia statute, on a) non-violent, non-drug related\ntraffic charges, b) non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor\ncharges, or c) non-violent, non-drug related felony charges who\nwere subjected to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat\nsearches without any individualized finding of reasonable\nsuspicion or probable cause that they were concealing drugs,\nweapons or other contraband, by United States Marshals at the\nDistrict of Columbia Superior Courthouse, while they were held in\nthe Superior Court Cell Block waiting for presentment before a\njudge or other judicial officer of the District of Columbia\nSuperior Court.\n4. The great majority of the \"Fourth Amendment Named\nPlaintiffs\" and the class members were released from custody\nafter presentment directly from the presentment courtroom either\n4\n-------,-----\n\no\n(J\n,.\nbecause their cases were no-papered or because they were released\non personal recognizance. The Fourth Amendment class does not\napply to those who were returned to jail custody because they had\nbail set that they were unable to post or were detained on the\ncharges on which they were presented or other charges such that\nthey were properly processed into the general jail population for\ncontinued detention and were subjected to visual body cavity or\nsquat searches prior to being processed into the general jail\npopulation at the DC Jailor the Correctional Treatment Facility.\n5. The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs base their claims on\nthe Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits\nsubjecting persons arrested on traffic, misdemeanor or felony non\ndrug, non violent offenses to strip and squat searches without an\nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause\nthat the person was concealing drugs, weapons or other\ncontraband.\n6. Plaintiffs Dianna Johnson, Rubbiya Muhammad, Carolyn\nMontgomery, Tonya Cecelia Mack, Laura Lambert, Dianne Wilkes,\nVickie Brooks, Keisha Holloway and Donna Curtis (the \"Fifth\nAmendment Named Plaintiffsfl are women arrestees arrested on all\n)\ntypes of District of Columbia charges, inclUding drug and violent\noffenses, who were subjected to blanket strip, visual body cavity\nand/or squat searches, by United States Marshals at the District\nof Columbia Superior Courthouse, while held in the Superior Court\n5\n\no\nCell Block waiting for presentment before a judge or other\njudicial officer of the District of Columbia Superior Court on a\ncharge brought under a District of Columbia statute. Defendants\nsubject women arrestees to such searches, but do not subject\nsimilarly situated men arrestees, including men charged with drug\nand violent offenses, to them.\n7. The great majority of the \"Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs\"\nand the class members are released from custody after presentment\ndirectly from the presentment courtroom either because their\ncases are no~papered or because they are released on personal\nrecognizance. The Fourth Amendment class does not apply to those\nwho were returned to jail custody because they had bail set that\nthey were unable to post or were detained on the charges on which\nthey were presented or other charges such that they were properly\nprocessed into the general jail population for continued\ndetention and were subjected to visual body cavity or squat\nsearches prior to being processed into the general jail\npopulation.\n8. The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs base their claims on\nthe equal protection component of the due process clause of the\nFifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which\nprohibits treating similarly situated men and women differently\nbased on their gender.\n6\n----'------------,------\n\nc\n9. As used herein, \"presentmentU refers to the initial\nproceeding before the Court referred to in Rule 5 of the Superior\nCourt Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n10. Violent offense means any of the offenses defined as a\n\"crime of violenceu in D.C. Code § 23-1331(4) as defined under\nTitle 22 of the D.C. Code, misdemeanor simple assault, D.C. Code\n§ 22-404 and misdemeanor threats, D.C. Code § 22-407.\n11. Drug offense means any offense under District of Columbia\nlaw that has as an element, the possession, possession with\nintent to distribute, or the distribution of, any substance\nreferred to in D.C. Code § 48-901.02, or any item defined as drug\nparaphernalia by D.C. Code § 48-1101(3).\n12. Traffic offense means any offense prosecuted by the\nCorporation Counsel's Office of the District of Columbia.\n13. Superior 'Court Cell Block as used herein includes not only\nthe lock up behind Superior Court Courtroom C-I0, but also the\nlock up behind the courtroom where presentments are held for\npersons arrested on traffic offenses, if strip, squat and visual\nbody cavity searches are held there.\n14. The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action\nagainst the Government of the District of Columbia, Todd Dillard\nin his individual capacity, and Does 1-10, in their individual\ncapacities, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of\n7\n\no\n1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce their Fourth Amendment Rights.\nAlternatively, the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this\naction against Todd Dillard, in his individual capacity, and Does\n1-10 in their individual capacities, directly under the Fourth\nAmendment to the Constitution. The Fourth Amendment Named\nPlaintiffs bring this action against the United States Marshals\nService directly under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.\n15. The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action\nagainst the Government of the District of Columbia, Todd Dillard\nin his individual capacity, and Does 11-20, in their individual\ncapacities, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of\n1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce their Fifth Amendment Rights.\nAlternatively, the Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this\naction against Todd Dillard, in his individual capacity, and John\nDoes 11-20, in their individual capacities, directly under the\nFifth Amendment to the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment Named\nPlaintiffs bring this action against the United States Marshals\nService directly under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n16. This Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a) (3) because plaintiffs'\nclaims are based on Section 1983 and the Constitution.\n17. Venue is appropriate in this District. The claim for relief\narose in this judicial district.\n8\n------,---------~-----\n\n/\"',,\",\\\nU\n•\nFourth Amendment Class ~ction Allegations\n18. The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action\nunder Rules 23 (a), 23 (b) (2), and 23 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of each woman\nwho, in the three years preceding the filing of this action, up\nuntil the date this case is terminated, was or will be, (i) while\nbeing held in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) for presentment\nunder a statute of the District of Columbia; on either (iii) (a) a\nnon drug, non violent traffic offense; (iii) (b) a non dreg, non\nviolent misdemeanor; or (iii) (c) a non drug, non violent felony;\n(iv) was subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity search\nand/or squat search without any individualized finding of\nreasonable suspicion or probable cause that she was concealing\ndrugs, weapons or other contraband.\n19. Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(b) (2) is appropriate because defendants District of\nColumbia and the united States Marshals Service and the other\ndefendants have a policy and engage in a pattern and practice of\nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and\ninjunctive relief against Defendants will benefit each and every\nplaintiff and class member.\n20. The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating\nthe above described policy of blanket searches not based on\nindividualized or particularized suspicion or probable cause.\n9\n\nf\"\n<-../\n21. Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil\n-~\nProcedure 23(b) (3) is also appropriate, in that common questions\nof law and fact predominate over any individual questions, and a\nclass action is superior for the fair and efficient adjudication\nof this controversy as detailed below.\n22. Regarding the Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs, and members\nof the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of\nliability, because every woman arrestee held in the Superior\nCourt Cell Block is subjected to the blanket searches, and none\nof the defendants keeps records of the searches and therefore\nnone of the defendants can show that any of the searches were\nconducted based on an individual determination of reasonable\nsuspicion. Should records exist demonstrating such\nindividualized suspicion, such people would, by definition, not\nbe members of the class.\n23. Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are:\na. whether Defendant District of Columbia and the United\nStates Marshals Service have a policy, custom and\npractice of subjecting female arrestees being held in\nthe Superior Court Cell Block pending presentment to\nblanket strip, visual body cavity searches and/or squat\nsearches without an individualized determination that\nthe woman was in possession of drugs, weapons or other\ncontraband;\n10\n\n•\nb. whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the\nFourth Amendment;\nc. whether the individual defendants were deliberately\nindifferent to the rights of such women arresteep;\nd. whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have\nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of\nsuch damages;\ne. whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and\nfuture members are entitled to equitable relief, and,\nif so, what is the nature of that relief; and\nf. whether determination of damages suffered by a\nstatistically representative sample of the class\nprovides the basis for determination of all class\nmembers' damages except those who opt out.\n24. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable. The exact number of class members is unknown to\nplaintiffs at this time, but is likely to consist of at least\nmany hundreds of people.\n25. Every week at least 10 women meeting the Fourth Amendment\nclass definition are held in the Superior Court Cell Block\npending presentment and subject to the illegal searches. Thus\nthis class well exceeds 1000 members.\n11\n\n!~\n~,..,\n26. Defendant District of Columbia has within its records the\nnames and addresses of all the current and past class members in\nthe \"CIJIIS\" computer system (computerized booking program used\nby District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department described\nbelow) .\n27. The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs' claims are typical of\nthe claims of the other members of the class, because the Fourth\nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and all other members of the class\nwere injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the blanket\nsearches.\n28. The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and\nhave retained counsel who are competent and experienced in\ncomplex federal civil rights class action litigation and/or\ncomplex federal prisoner rights litigation.\n29. The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs have no interests that\nare contrary to or in conflict with those of the class.\n30. The Fourth Amendment Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty\nthat will be encountered in the management of this litigation\nthat would preclude its maintenance as a class action, and the\nclass action is superior to any other available means to resolve\nthe issues raised on behalf of the Fourth Amendment Class. The\nclass action will be manageable because so many different records\nsystems exist from which to ascertain the members of the putative\n12\n----------\n\n(~\n\\,.\"\",\n•\n•\nclass. For example, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police\nDepartment maintains \"CIJIIS\", a computerized booking system that\ncaptures the name, address, charge, date of charge, date of\npresentment and post presentment custody status, for every\narrestee, and the District of Columbia Superior Court maintains\n\"CIS\", a computer database that captures the name, address,\ncharge, date of charge, date of presentment, docket number and\npost presentment custody status disposition for every arrestee.\nClass treatment will be superior because liability can be\ndetermined on a class wide basis, and damages can also be\ndetermined on a class wide basis through use of statistical\nsampling.\nFifth Amendment Class Action Allegations\n31. The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs bring this action under\nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of each woman\nwho, in the three years preceding the filing of this action, up\nuntil the date this case is terminated, was or will be, (i) while\nin the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) being held for presentment\nsubject to a statute of the District of Columbia; (iii) under\nsimilar circumstances as men arrestees; (iv) subjected to a\nblanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search.\n32.

The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable. The exact number of class members is unknown to\nplaintiffs at this time, but is likely to consist of at least\nseveral thousands of people.\n38. Every week at least seventy-five women meeting the Fifth\nAmendment class definition are held in the Superior Court Cell\nBlock pending presentment and sUbject to the illegal searches.\n39. The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs' claims are typical of\nthe claims of the other members of the class, because the Fifth\nAmendment Named Plaintiffs and all other members of the class\nwere injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the blanket\nsearches.\n40. The Fifth Amendment Named Plaintiffs will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and\nhave retained counsel who are competent and experienced in\ncomplex federal civil rights class action litigation and/or\ncomplex federal prisoner rights litigation.\n41.

Every person held in the Superior Court Cell Block pending\npresentment who has been arrested either on a District of\nColumbia warrant or on suspicion of violation of a District of\nColumbia statute is held in the joint custody of the United\nStates Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia\n(Todd Dillard) and the Government of the District of Columbia.\n60. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia is an agency\nof the Government of the District of Columbia.\n61.

Code §§ 13-\n302, 16-703, 23-501, 23-561, 23-563 and 23-581 and cooperative\nagreements entered into between the United States Marshals\nService and the Government of the District of Columbia pursuant\nto D.C.

Defendant District of Columbia pays every year for some or\nall of the costs of operation, maintenance and repair of space\nused by the United States Marshals Service at the District of\nColumbia Superior Court Courthouse.\n20\n~~~~~~~-------\n\n63. Defendant District of Columbia pays every year for some or\nall of the costs incurred by the United States Marshals Service\nin performing their duties at the District of Columbia Superior\nCourt Courthouse.\n64. The United States Marshal for the Superior Court and his\ndeputies act as the agents of the Defendant District of Columbia\npursuant to District of Columbia statutes, policies and/or\npractices while holding arrestees in the Superior Court Cell\nBlock.\n65. The arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block have been\nsubjected to pat down searches by the transporting police\nofficers before being transported to the Superior Court Cell\nBlock.\n66. Any person who is transported to the Superior Court Cell\nBlock from any of the seven District of Columbia Metropolitan\nPolice Department patrol districts or the District of Columbia\nMetropolitan Police Department's Central Cell Block has been\nsubjected to a thorough pat down at the patrol station or the\nDistrict of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department Central Cell\nBlock before being transported to Superior Court Cell Block.\n67. The only persons housed in the Superior Court Cell Block are\narrestees brought to the Superior Court Courthouse for\npresentment to a jUdicial officer of the District of Columbia on\na charge of violating a District of Columbia statute.\n21\n\n()\n()\n~\n•\n68. The great majority of women arrestees are released directly\nfrom the Superior Court Courthouse after presentment either\nbecause their cases are no-papered or they are released on\npersonal recognizance. The Fourth and Fifth Amendment classes do\nnot encompass those who were returned to jail custody because\nthey had bail set that they were unable to post or were detained\non the charges on which they were presented or other charges such\nthat they were properly processed into the general jail\npopulation for continued detention and were subjected to visual\nbody cavity or squat searches prior to being processed into the\ngeneral jail population.\n69. Many women arrestees arrested on felony charges have their\ncharges ~papered down\" to a misdemeanor before presentment.\n70. Women and men arrestees who are denied bail and held pending\ntrial are transported in vans and buses from the Superior Court\nCourthouse to the DC Jail.\n71. Other prisoners at the Superior Court Courthouse are not\nintermingled with the arrestees prior to the search.\n72. Men arrestees and women arrestees brought to the Superior\nCourt Courthouse are segregated by sex, and the men and women are\nheld separately in separate areas in the Superior Court Cell\nBlock.\n22\n\n-----_._----,.-~---,.------------------\no\n•\n73. The United States Marshal for the Superior Court, and his\ndeputies, follow a policy and custom of subjecting, upon their\nadmission to the Superior Court Cell Block, all women arrestees\nto blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches\nwithout a particularized finding of reasonable quspicion that the\nwoman arrestee is in possession of weapons, drugs or other\ncontraband.\n74. Agents of the Marshals Service actually physically conduct\nthe visual body cavity and squat searches of the women arrestees\nin the Superior Court Cell Block.\n75. Agents of the District of Columbia, including the united\nStates Marshal for the Superior Court and his deputies, do not\nsubject men arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block awaiting\npresentment to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat\nsearches.\n76. The search procedure conducted on the women arrestees in the\nSuperior Court Cell Block is as follows:\n77. When women arrestees are transported to the Superior Court\nCell Block, a female United States Marshals conducts full body\npat down searches on them from head to toe.\n78. A female Marshal then makes the women arrestees take off\ntheir shoes and shake them out.\n23\n\nI::\n79. A female Marshal then directs the arrestees to pull up her\n•\nskirt or to lower her pants and to pull down any undergarments.\n80. A female Marshal then makes the arrestees squat and turn\naround and display their buttocks and their genitals to the\nfemale Marshal.\n81. The searches are conducted in front of all the women\narrestees already in the Superior Court Cell Block.\n82. The searches are public, humiliating, and degrading and\ncause emotional and psychic injury to the women arrestees.\n83. The practice of the searches is not supported by a\ndocumented history of contraband smuggling at the Superior Court\nCell Block.\n84. Other less invasive means of searching the women arrestees\nexist, such as thorough pat downs, electronic screeners and hand\nheld \"wands\" or scanners, or drug detection canines.\n85. After the Marshals conduct the strip, squat and visual body\ncavity searches on the women arrestees, the Marshals put the\nwomen in the Superior Court Cell Block and allow them to have\nunsupervised visits with attorneys.\n86. The attorneys and the women arrestees are separated only by\ngrills that have 4 inch by 12 inch slots in the grill work for\nitems and paperwork to be passed through.\n24\n-------- ----------------\n_..\n\n(~\n\\J\n87. United States Marshals Service employees including Does 1-10\nand Does 11-20 participated in making and implementing the policy\nof subjecting women arrestees to the above-described searches.\n88.

The Government of the District of Columbia knows that women\narrestees will be subjected to blanket searches in the Superior\nCourt Cell Block and the Government of the District of Columbia\nacquiesces in the searches.\n90. The Government of the District of Columbia ha5 never\nprotested the searches.\n91. The District of Columbia delegated its duties to the United\nStates Marshals Service but failed to train the Marshals in strip\nsearch polices even though the need for training was obvious.\n92. The constitutional violations that resulted are foreseeable\nbecause of the District's failure to train.\n93.

There is no subject matter jurisdiction over the only\nremaining claim against the United States Marshals Service (“USMS”) because Plaintiffs lack\nstanding to advance that claim, and the claim is moot.1  The claims against Todd Dillard are barred\nby the doctrine of qualified immunity, and because the action against him fails to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted.\n1  Plaintiffs have conceded that they have no colorable damages action against the United\nStates Marshals Service.  See Plaintiffs’ Notice, filed May 26, 2006 [dkt. no. 60].  Plaintiffs have\naffirmed their intention, however, to maintain their claim against the USMS for preliminary and\npermanent injunctive relief.  Id.; see also First Amended Complaint at 50.\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 3 of 35(cid:10)\nTHE COMPLAINT\nBy an Amended Complaint (“Am. Compl.”)  filed on May 1, 2006, Plaintiffs seek to advance\nclass action claims against the government of the District of Columbia and against the USMS, Todd\nDillard and unnamed “Doe” Defendants in their individual capacities involving alleged violations\nof Plaintiffs’ fourth amendment right to privacy and their fifth amendment right to equal protection.2\nAm. Compl. at ¶¶ 1-17, 65-69.  Plaintiffs also advance a class action claim against both the District\nof Columbia and the Federal Defendants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, on the theory that authority\nover those detained in the cellblock of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, during the\nrelevant time period, derived from the District of Columbia Government. Id.\nBy way of summary, the Amended Complaint seeks to advance a class action under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(a), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3), with two sub-classes – a Fourth Amendment Class (hereinafter\n“4AC”) and a Fifth Amendment Class (hereinafter “5AC”). Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 1-17, 20, 33.  The\n4AC, as defined, consists of all adult women arrestees who, during the action and in the three-year\nperiod preceding it, were held for presentment in the cellblock of the Superior Court of the District\nof Columbia for an offense defined under a D.C. statute that did not involve drugs or violence and\nwho were subjected to “a blanket strip, visual body cavity search and/or squat search without any\nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs,\nweapons or other contraband.”  Id. at ¶ 20.  The 5AC, as defined, consists of all adult women\narrestees who, during the same time frame as the 4AC, were held for presentment in the cellblock\nof the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for any offense defined under a D.C. statute, under\nsimilar circumstances as men arrestees, and who were subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity\n2  The USMS and Mr. Dillard are hereinafter referred to as the “Federal Defendants.”\n2\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 4 of 35(cid:10)\nand/or squat search, even if the search was based upon an individualized finding of reasonable\nsuspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. Id. at 33.\nPlaintiffs further allege that Defendant USMS is a federal agency, but is jointly responsible\nwith Defendant District of Columbia, as an agent thereof, for planning and implementing the “strip,\nvisual body cavity and squat searches” of women arrestees described in the Complaint. Am. Compl.\nat ¶ 66.  Plaintiffs have advanced suit against ten “Doe” Deputy United States Marshals (DUSMs),\nwhom they contend developed and implemented the policy challenged by the 4AC, and against\nanother ten “Doe” DUSMs, whom they further contend developed and implemented the policy\ncomplained of by the 5AC. Id. at ¶¶ 68-69.\nPlaintiffs specifically allege that “[t]he United States Marshal for the Superior Court, and his\ndeputies, follow a policy and custom of subjecting, upon their admission to the Superior Court Cell\nBlock, all women arrestees to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches without a\nparticularized finding of reasonable suspicion that the woman arrestee [sic] is in possession of\nweapons, drugs or other contraband.” Am. Compl. at ¶ 83.  Further, according to the Complaint,\n“[a]gents of the District of Columbia, including the United States Marshal for the Superior Court and\nhis deputies, do not subject men arrestees in the Superior Court Cell Block awaiting presentment to\nblanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches.” Id. at ¶ 85.3\nAfter purporting to describe the nature of the search of the women arrestees, Am. Compl. at\n¶¶ 86 - 102, Plaintiffs proceed to make a number of non-factual, conclusory statements about the\nprocess. Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 103-106.  Among the statements made is that “[t]he practice of the\n3  Federal Defendants dispute that there is a disparity in the treatment of men and women\narrestees, but for the purposes of this motion, understand that the Court must treat Plaintiffs’\nallegations as true.\n3\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 5 of 35(cid:10)\nsearches is not justified by a legitimate security interest.” Id. at ¶ 105.4  Plaintiffs allege that both\nDistrict of Columbia and USMS employees participated in making and implementing the described\nsearches and that District of Columbia employees “acquiesce in and facilitate the practice.”5 Id. at\n109-110.\nPlaintiffs allege that Todd Dillard, as the (former) United States Marshal for the Superior\nCourt of the District of Columbia, derived “his authority over women arrestees in the Superior Court\nCell Block pursuant to statutes of the District of Columbia, including D.C. Code §§ 13-302, 16-703,\n23-501, 23-561, 23-563 and 23-581 and cooperative agreements entered into between the United\nStates Marshals Service and the government of the District of Columbia pursuant to D.C. Code\n§ 5-133.17, and the authority of the Chief Judge acting in an administrative capacity for the District\nof Columbia.” Am. Compl. at ¶ 132.  Further, they assert another legal conclusion that, “Defendant\nTodd Dillard and Does 1-10 and Does 11-20 were acting under color of District of Columbia law\nand . . . were acting pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of Defendant District of Columbia.\nId. at ¶ 133.\nAfter summarizing allegations concerning the individual circumstances and alleged unlawful\ntreatment of the named Plaintiffs, Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 134-170, Plaintiffs set forth substantive counts\nas follows.  Count I purports to set forth claimed fourth amendment violations against the 4AC under\n4  Such a legal conclusion should not be viewed in a light most favorable to the Plaintiff, as\nother truly factual allegations advanced in the Complaint.\n5  Plaintiffs have alleged that the events to which the First Amended Complaint refers\n“occurred before the last day of April, 2003,” Am. Compl. at ¶ 3, and that in April, 2003, “the\nFederal Defendants represented [through their United States Justice Department attorneys] to the\nPlaintiffs  and  the  Court  that  they  stopped  the  strip  search  practices  described  herein.”  Id.\nNonetheless, Plaintiffs have written their Amended Complaint in the present tense. Id.\n4\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 6 of 35(cid:10)\n42 U.S.C. § 1983. Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 171-180.  Count II purports to set forth claimed fourth\namendment violations against the 4AC by the Federal Defendants. Id. at ¶¶ 181-186.  Counts III and\nIV set forth claims involving the 5AC.  Count III purports to set forth claimed fifth amendment\nviolations against the 5AC under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Id. at ¶¶ 187-199.  Finally, Count IV, in like\nmanner, alleges claimed fifth amendment violations against the 5AC by the Federal Defendants. Id.\nat ¶¶ 200 - 204.  Plaintiffs assert a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief, then set forth their\nprayer for relief. Id. at ¶¶ 205 - 206 & at 49 - 51.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nA. Dismissal for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction (Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1))\n“A motion under 12(b)(1) ‘presents a threshold challenge to the court's jurisdiction.’”\nGardner v. U.S., No. 96-1467, 1999 WL 164412, Slip op. at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 29, 1999), quoting\nHaase v. Sessions, 835 F.2d 902, 906 (D.C. Cir. 1987), aff’d, 213 F.3d 735 (D.C. Cir. 2000), cert.\ndenied, 531 U.S. 1153 (2001); see also 4 Wright & Miller: Federal Prac. & Proc. § 1350 (R12) (2002\nSupplement) (“...subject matter jurisdiction deals with the power of the court to hear the plaintiff’s\nclaims in the first place, and therefore imposes upon courts an affirmative obligation to ensure that\nthey are acting within the scope of their jurisdictional power.”)  \nA court may resolve a motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) in two ways.\nFirst, the court may determine the motion based solely on the complaint.  Herbert v. National\nAcademy of Science, 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  Alternatively, to determine the existence\nof jurisdiction, a court may look beyond the allegations of the complaint, consider affidavits and\nother extrinsic information, and ultimately weigh the conflicting evidence.  See id.; see also Cureton\nv. United States Marshal Service, 322 F.Supp.2d 23, 26 (D.D.C. 2004). \n5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 7 of 35(cid:10)\nB. Motion for Failure to State a Claim (Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6))\nIn making determinations on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must view\nfacts alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S.\n41, 45-46 (1957); Nix v. Hoke, 139 F. Supp. 2d 125 (D.D.C. 2001), citing Weyrich v. The New\nRepublic, Inc., 235 F.3d 617, 623 (D.C. Cir. 2001); see also Slaby v. Fairbridge, 3 F. Supp. 2d 22,\n27 (D.D.C. 1998).  A complaint should be dismissed if it \"appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff\ncan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\"  Conley, 355 U.S.\nat 46.  See also Warren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 37 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (noting that the\n12(b)(6) dismissal standard is no different for pro se  prisoner complaints, despite frequent\nincantation that courts should apply a “liberal construction” in such cases: “But again this is not\nunique for prisoner cases.  It is the ‘accepted rule’ in every type of case.”).  Although the plaintiff\nis given the benefit of all inferences that reasonably can be derived from the facts alleged in the\ncomplaint, the court need not accept inferences that are not supported by such facts, nor must the\ncourt accept plaintiff’s legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.  Kowal v. MCI\nCommunications Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  \nARGUMENT\nI. Federal Defendant Todd Dillard Is Entitled to Qualified Immunity.\nFederal Defendant Todd Dillard is entitled to qualified immunity. See Anderson v. Creighton,\n483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987); Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 191 (1984), and Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457\nU.S. 800, 806 (1982).  Individually-named federal defendants sued for money damages for violations\nof constitutional rights are immune from suit under the doctrine of qualified immunity if, inter alia,\nthe complaint fails to allege facts that give rise to the violation of a clearly-established constitutional\n6\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 8 of 35(cid:10)\nor statutory right of which a reasonable person would have known.    Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194,\n196 (2001); Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818 (government officials are shielded from liability for civil\ndamages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\nof which a reasonable person would have known); Farmer v. Moritsugu, 163 F.3d 610, 613 (D.C.\nCir. 1998); see also Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985) (“Unless the plaintiff’s allegations\nstate a claim of violation of clearly established law, a defendant pleading qualified immunity is\nentitled to dismissal before the commencement of discovery.”); Zweibon v. Mitchell, 720 F.2d 162,\n168 (D.C. Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 880 (1984) (“once the trial judge determines the law was\nnot clearly established at the time the contested conduct occurred, the inquiry ceases.”).  \nOnce the individual defendant raises qualified immunity, courts must resolve two issues: (1)\nwhether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged and, if the violation is\nestablished, then (2) whether the right alleged to have been violated was clearly established such that\na reasonable person would have known.  Saucier, 533 U.S. at 196.  For a public official to be liable\nfor damages, that official both must have violated a constitutional right, and that right must have\nbeen “clearly established” at the time of the violation – “[t]he contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that\nright.”  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. at 640 (“qualified immunity protects ‘all but the plainly\nincompetent or those who knowingly violate the law’”) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341\n(1986)).\nThe validity of the qualified immunity analysis “depends substantially upon the level of\ngenerality at which the relevant ‘legal rule’ is to be identified.” Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639.  At the\nfirst stage of the inquiry, “courts must not define the relevant constitutional right in overly general\n7\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 9 of 35(cid:10)\nterms, lest they strip the qualified immunity defense of all meaning.”  Butera v. District of Columbia,\n235 F.3d 637, 646 (D.C. Cir .2001); see International Action Center, 365 F.3d at 25.  As the Butera\nCourt explained:\nFor example, the right to due process of law is quite clearly established by the Due\nProcess Clause, and thus there is a sense in which any action that violates that Clause\n(no matter how unclear it may be that the particular action is a violation) violates a\nclearly established right. Much the same could be said of any other constitutional or\nstatutory violation. But if the test of \"clearly established law\" were to be applied at\nthis level of generality, it would bear no relationship  to the \"objective legal\nreasonableness\" that is the touchstone of Harlow.  Plaintiffs would be able to convert\nthe rule of qualified immunity that our cases plainly establish into a rule of virtually\nunqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights. \nId. (citing Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639).  Thus, it is not enough for Plaintiffs here to claim that the\nsearches to which they were subject violated their constitutional rights. Rather, the claimed\nconstitutional right “must be identified ‘at the appropriate level of specificity’ for a court to\ndetermine the second prong of the inquiry:  whether the right was ‘clearly established.’” Wilson v.\nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 615 (1999).  As the Supreme Court stated in Anderson, “[t]his is not to say that\nan official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously\nbeen held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of preexisting law the unlawfulness must be\napparent.” 483 U.S. at 640 (citation omitted).   Given the state of the law concerning blanket strip\nsearches, and the fact-based analysis associated with existing case authority, the Complaint here does\nnot allege the violation of constitutional or statutory rights that were clearly established under law,\nor sufficiently clear or apparent at the time of the alleged violation.  Defendant Dillard submits that,\neven assuming the truth of the allegations of the Amended Complaint,  “the state of the law [at the\nrelevant time did not give officials] fair warning that their alleged treatment of [the plaintiffs] was\nunconstitutional.”  Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002).\n8\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 10 of 35(cid:10)\nAny analysis of the constitutionality of prisoner searches necessarily begins with the United\nStates Supreme Court's landmark decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  In that case,\npretrial detainees challenged the constitutionality of numerous conditions of confinement and\npractices at the New York Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federally-operated, short-term\ncustodial facility in New York City designed primarily to house pretrial detainees.  One of the\nchallenged practices the Court addressed was the strip and visual body cavity search conducted on\nall inmates after every contact with an outside visitor.\nIn its analysis, the Court strongly emphasized that \"maintaining security and preserving\ninternal order and discipline [were] essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of the\nretained constitutional rights of . . . pretrial detainees.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 546.  \"Central to all other\ncorrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal security within the corrections facilities\nthemselves.\"  Id. at 546-47 (citations omitted).  \"Prison officials must be free to take appropriate\naction  to  ensure  the  safety  of  inmates  and  corrections  personnel  and  to  prevent  escape  or\nunauthorized entry,\" and  \"[t]he Government must be able to take steps to maintain security and\norder at the institution and make certain no weapons or illicit drugs reach detainees.\"  Id. at 540,\n546-47  (citations  omitted).    \"[E]ven  when  an  institutional  restriction  infringes  a  specific\nconstitutional guarantee, such as the Fourth Amendment, the practice must be evaluated in the light\nof the central objective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional security.\"  Id. at 547.  \nThis evaluation, however, according to the Bell Court, was an extremely deferential one.  The\nCourt stated that \"[p]rison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the\nadoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve the\ninternal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 547 (citations\n9\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 11 of 35(cid:10)\nomitted).  \"‘Such considerations are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\ncorrections officials, and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the\nofficials have exaggerated their response to these considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to\ntheir expert judgment in such matters.'\"  Id. at 547-48, quoting Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827\n(1974).    The  Court  noted  that  \"judicial  deference  [was]  accorded  not  merely  because  the\nadministrator ordinarily will, as a matter of fact in a particular case, have a better grasp of his domain\nthan the reviewing judge, but also because the operation of our correctional facilities is peculiarly\nthe province of the Legislative and Executive Branches of our Government, not the Judicial.\"  Bell,\n441 U.S. at 548 (citation omitted).\nThe Court held that such a strip search procedure was not an unreasonable search prohibited\nby the Fourth Amendment.  The Court noted that \"[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth\nAmendment [was] not capable of precise definition or mechanical application\" and that \"each case\n. . . requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights\nthat the search entails.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 549.   The factors that must be considered, the Court held,\nwere \"the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for\ninitiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\"  Id. at 559.\nThe Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has not rendered a decision addressing whether\na blanket strip search policy violates the Fourth Amendment.   Accordingly, the lead federal court\nin this Circuit has not ruled on the question.  Nonetheless, in the years since Bell, a number of federal\ncourts have ruled that the Fourth Amendment precludes these types of searches on arrestees charged\nwith misdemeanors or other minor offenses brought to the jail after arrest unless officials have\n10\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 12 of 35(cid:10)\nreasonable suspicion that the specific arrestee is concealing weapons, drugs or other contraband.6\nHowever, other federal courts have considered the practice in various contexts and determined that\nthere were permissible bases for conducting the searches.  And, each case is considered on its own\nfacts and circumstances.\nThis caselaw has developed in the context of allowing blanket prisoner strip search policies,\nwithout individualized assessment, in circumstances where individualized assessment is not readily\npractical and the risks are substantial.  Thus, courts in certain circumstances have upheld the\nconstitutionality of strip searches of detainees, even for those who were charged only with\nmisdemeanors, minor offenses, or crimes not involving violence.  These courts have focused on the\nfact that the detainees searched had already been intermingled with all other prisoners; that they had\naccess through attorneys or others to possible contraband; and that the facility had a history of\nattempts to introduce contraband.\nThus, in Richerson v. Lexington Fayette Urban County Government, 958 F.Supp. 299 (E.D.\nKy. 1996), the plaintiff had been arrested for a non-violent traffic offense and taken to the County\nDetention Center where he was held in the general population as a pretrial detainee.

The arraignment was held in the\nDistrict Court Building, which was connected to the Detention Center by a pedway.  The pedway\nopened into a holding cell adjacent to the courtroom.  Plaintiff, along with other detainees, walked\nacross the pedway and was placed in the holding cell, where he had access to his attorney.  He was\nthen arraigned in the courtroom, where members of the general public were present.  After his\narraignment, plaintiff was placed back into the holding cell until all arraignments were completed.\nFollowing his arraignment, Mr. Richerson was subject to a strip search.  This search involved\nPlaintiff removing his jumpsuit and any other clothing.  While naked, he and other detainees were\nmade to lift up their arms, open their mouths, lift their tongues, run their fingers through their hair,\nturn from side to side, lift their genitals and turn around, bend over and spread their buttocks for\ninspection, and show the bottoms of their feet.  Mr. Richerson was then returned to the Detention\nCenter, where he was placed back in the general population.\nThe Court noted that the County strip searched prisoners only after they had intermingled\nwith other prisoners and had outside access to attorneys and others.  The Court upheld the\nconstitutionality of the blanket strip search policy.  The Court held that,\nin circumstances like those presented here, where pretrial detainees, including those\ncharged with minor, nonviolent offenses, are kept in a detention center’s general\npopulation prior to arraignment, and are thereafter put in a position where\nexposure to the general public presents a very real danger of contraband being\npassed to a detainee, a policy of strip searching the detainees upon their return from\nthe courthouse and prior to their being placed back in the general population of the\ndetention center is both justified and reasonable.  The Court determined that the\ndetention center’s legitimate security interests outweigh[ed] the detainees’ privacy\ninterests in such a situation.\n Richerson at 307 (emphasis added).

The security interests of the\njail in conducting a search at this point were strong.

Ill. 1985)\n(“The policy considerations for conducting strip-searches when detainees have had outside contacts\nare more compelling than in the case of initial searches of traffic and misdemeanor detainees.

Ill.1983),  Ms. Roscom\nwas charged with deceptive practice when she wrote a number of checks that had been dishonored\nby her bank.  She was taken to the City jail but later transferred to the County jail, where she was\nsubjected to a strip search pursuant to the County’s policy.  The policy allowed such searches either\nwhen there was a reasonable suspicion that the inmate might have a weapon or contraband, or when\ninmates were moving into or out of “high risk areas,” e.g., from the holding cells to the general jail\npopulation.  She was taken to a room with other females, all of whom were ordered to line up in\nsingle file and take off their clothes.  After a frontal visual search by the matron, Ms. Roscom was\ninstructed to turn around, spread her legs and bend over for a visual genital area search.  Only women\n13\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 15 of 35(cid:10)\nwere in the room when the searches took place, and at no time during the search did anyone touch\nMs. Roscom.\nThe Court applied the Bell balancing test and, noting that the strip search procedure was a\nlegitimate one to insure the security of the County jail, upheld the search.  The Court stated that\n“[i]rrespective of the crimes [with which the detainees were charged], [the] County [jail] may\nreasonably consider any of them could be carrying weapons or contraband, either brought with the\ndetainee into the County Jail or procured from other persons in the holding cell.”  Roscom at 1262.\n The Court also noted that the County had a legitimate interest in the security of its jail, the strip\nsearch was carried out by same-sex personnel, and in a separate room.  The strip search was,\ntherefore, constitutionally permissible.\nIn balancing the government’s need for a particular search against the invasion of personal\nrights that the search entails, courts have consistently recognized that the general threats posed in the\njail context may outweigh an individual’s privacy interests.  In other words, these courts have\nrecognized that jail officials are not necessarily required to have a particularized suspicion that a\nspecific arrestee is concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband before a search will be found\nreasonable and constitutional.\nFor example, in Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 WL 547116 (N.D. Ill. 1998), the Court examined the\nconstitutionality of strip searches conducted on female detainees after they had been ordered released\nfrom custody by a judge.  The Court explained the balancing test as follows:\n[I]f jail security is to justify the search the detainee must present some threat to jail\nsecurity.  The facts in the cases where searches have been upheld suggest some\nreasonable cause on the part of the authorities to suspect that the detainees might be\ntrying to smuggle weapons or contraband into the jail. . . .  A person detained for\nviolent crime may presumptively be suspected of carrying a weapon.  However, when\n14\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 16 of 35(cid:10)\nan arrestee is being detained briefly awaiting the posting of bond on a traffic or\nmisdemeanor offense, generally a strip-search can be made only on reasonable\nsuspicion that the arrestee is carrying or concealing a weapon or contraband unless\nauthorities can demonstrate that misdemeanants regularly pose a threat to jail\nsecurity.\nGary at 1998 WL 547116, *13, citing Simenc v. Sheriff of DuPage County, 1985 WL 4896, at *3\n(emphasis added).  See also N.G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225 (2nd Cir. 2004) (upheld strip search\nof juveniles upon initial admission to a detention facility); Smith v.

City\nof Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983) (same).\nThe United States District Court for the District of Columbia has upheld the policy requiring\na reasonable suspicion to strip search detainees.  Citing various authorities, the Court has said “ ‘strip\nsearches are violative of the Fourth Amendment when applied to all arrestees, Stewart v. Lubbock\nCounty, Texas, 767 F.2d 152 (5th Cir. 1985), or if only females are subjected to strip search, when\nsimilarly situated males are not searched, Mary Beth G. 723 F.2d at 1263, or if all arrestees, even\nthose charged with minor traffic offenses, are routinely searched, Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614\n(9th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1053 (1985).’”  Doe v. Berberich, 704 F.Supp. 269, 271\n(D.D.C. Cir. 1988) (search following arrest for possession of marijuana not violated Fourth\nAmendment). The Court went on to say that there must be a “reasonable suspicion that the category\nof offenders subject to strip searches might possess weapons or contraband.” Id.  In the Doe case,\n15\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 17 of 35(cid:10)\neven though the offense (possession of a controlled substance) was a misdemeanor, there was\nreasonable cause to believe that the detainees possessed contraband, therefore, a strip search was\nwithin the bounds of the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 272.  Further, the Court followed Bell v. Wolfish,\nand said that “even ‘visual’ body cavity searches of federal pretrial detainees can be conducted on\nless than probable cause so long as the search is conducted in a reasonable manner.”  441 U.S. at\n560.\nThus, under applicable case law, although individualized suspicion is required for prisoner\nstrip  searches  in  many  circumstances,  it  is  not  clear  that  a  blanket  strip  search  policy  is\nunconstitutional where the circumstances indicate a real security risk if all prisoners are not searched.\nBased on the decisions discussed above, although individualized suspicion is required for prisoner\nstrip searches in many circumstances, a blanket strip search policy is deemed constitutional where\nthe circumstances indicate a real security risk unless all prisoners, or a certain category of prisoners,\nare searched.  Therefore, Defendant Dillard submits that it was not apparent that a blanket strip\nsearch policy was unconstitutional.\nIn light of the case-specific nature of the fourth amendment analyses undertaken in these\ncases, and the unique circumstances of the D.C. Superior Court cellblock, Federal Defendants\nrespectfully submit that it was not clearly established that the search policy described in the\nAmended Complaint violated the Fourth Amendment.  The foundation for this conclusion is as\nfollows:\nAssuming the truth of the allegations of the Amended Complaint, the searches conducted\nwere consistent with the Bell factors of reasonableness in scope, manner, justification and place.\nPlaintiffs do not allege that the arrestees searched were required to remove all of their clothing, but\n16\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 18 of 35(cid:10)\ninstead to lower only that clothing sufficient to determine that she was not secreting weapons or\ncontraband.  The searches were conducted is a manner so as not unnecessarily to embarrass or\nhumiliate the arrestee to the extent that only women were in the area, and were as minimally\nintrusive as possible consistent with jail security.  The searches were conducted only by same-sex\npersonnel.\nThe facts and circumstances surrounding the searches, as alleged in the Amended Complaint,\nwere unique and distinguishable from those cases in which the courts have required individualized\nreasonable suspicion to believe that an arrestee is carrying weapons, contraband, or other drugs to\njustify a search.  Those cases generally involved “new” arrests in which police took arrestees directly\nto the jail and subjected them to strip searches.  In contrast, here MPD and the D.C. Jail deliver\narrestees to the D.C. Superior Court, the arrestees were alleged to have been intermingled; there had\nbeen outside access by attorneys and others, and prisoners had had the opportunity to secret\ncontraband in the orifices of their bodies. See e.g., Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 70-72.\nTo say that “[a] detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers [and\nthat]  [s]muggling  of  money,  drugs,  weapons,  and  other  contraband  is  all  too  common  an\noccurrence,” Bell 441 U.S. at 559, is to understate drastically the conditions at the D.C. Superior\nCourt.  The amount and nature of contraband recovered at the USMS cellblock, including from body\ncavities, is staggering and the danger is real.  The prisoners received at the USMS cellblock run the\ngamut from “protester” to violent sociopath.  They invariably have had contact with each other and\neven the most innocent looking can be preyed upon or be a threat. See e.g., Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 70-72.\nLikewise, the USMS is informed little about the history or character of each prisoner received.  Thus,\nthe only reliable way to assure security in this high-risk environment is to take reasonable steps to\n17\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 19 of 35(cid:10)\nensure  security.    On  the  unique  facts  presented  here,  Defendant  Dillard  believes  that  the\ncircumstances in the cellblock pose a sufficient danger to justify the blanket squat searches of\nprisoners utilized at the USMS cellblock of the District of Columbia Superior Court, even absent\nindividual reasonable suspicion that a particular prisoner was secreting weapons, drugs, or other\ncontraband.\nThe blanket searches conducted, which were less than full strip searches, were reasonable,\nsuch that the officials involved could not be found to have been violating a “clearly established\nfederal statutory or constitutional right” of the detainees. The officers were following clearly\nestablished USMS procedures.\nPlaintiffs appear to recognize that it is not former United States Marshal Dillard who\n“participated in making and implementing the policy of subjecting women arrestees to [the searches\nat issue];” rather, it was the “Doe” defendants.  See Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 84 (“[a]gents actually\nphysically conduct . . . searches”), 109 (USMS “employees participated in making and implementing\nthe policy”).  Indeed, the United States Marshals Service policy on the issue that was formalized in\n1999 makes no distinction between how Deputy Marshals are to treat female and male prisoners.\nSee United States Marshals Service Policy Directive 99-25 (July 7, 1999) at 1, § III(B) (attached\nhereto) (“This directive applies to all searches of persons, including juveniles.”). There is a\ndistinction between the searches of men and women under the policy, in that “[a] strip search should\nalways be conducted by a deputy of the same sex, unless the person conducting the search is a\nphysician, physician’s assistant or nurse.”)  Id., at 3, § IV(C)(3).  Plaintiffs do not object to the\nsearches because they are conducted by Deputy Marshals of the same gender as the person being\nsearched.\n18\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 20 of 35(cid:10)\nIf Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim is founded on a perceived disparity in the number of\nsearches made of women versus men, then their concern is with a perceived inconsistency in\napplying the policy.  Marshal Dillard is not alleged to have ever actually searched any of the\nPlaintiffs; and, indeed, he would not have done so, because the policy calls for only female Deputies\n(or medical personnel) to conduct searches of the female prisoners. Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 87-90.\nSimilarly, the policy quite logically calls for Deputy Marshals (not the U.S. Marshal) to conduct the\nsearches.  See Directive 99-25 at 3.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ claim against former Marshal Dillard\nnecessarily is that he did not do enough to ensure that the male Deputy Marshals were properly\nimplementing the policy as applied to the men arrestees within the cell block.  This amounts to a\nclaim that Mr. Dillard was somehow required personally to oversee the processing of every male\nthrough the cell block.  Such a standard is not what is required in the prison setting.  See Farmer v.\nMoritsugu, 163 F.3d 610, 613-14 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\nIn Farmer, the plaintiff argued that the Bureau of Prisons Medical Director was aware of, yet\nordered no treatment for, the prisoner’s medical condition.   The District Court agreed, finding that\nMoritsugu effectively “sanction[ed]” the withholding of treatment from Farmer.  The Court of\nAppeals, found, however, that Farmer's claims imply an obligation falling well outside the scope of\nMoritsugu's role as Medical Director, and, moreover, that Moritsugu's response to Farmer's requests\ncomported with constitutional BOP medical policy.  Thus, the Court concluded that Moritsugu's\nconduct met the standard of “objective legal reasonableness” required to support qualified immunity.\nId.\nHere, the Plaintiffs suggest that Mr. Dillard was not only required to ensure that a lawful\npolicy was adopted, but also that each male prisoner was searched when the policy permitted.  This\n19\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 21 of 35(cid:10)\nsuggestion was much like that rejected in Farmer.  The leader of the agency is simply not required\nto play a role in each day-to-day decision made by all employees under his or her supervision.\nFarmer, 163 F.3d at 615 (“the most important point in this case is that Moritsugu is not the person\nwithin the BOP who determines whether psychotherapy is required in a given case.  As Medical\nDirector, overseeing operations in facilities nationwide from his office in Washington, D.C.,\nMoritsugu does not diagnose individual patients; nor does he prescribe treatments for particular\npatients, except insofar as he may be called upon to approve the recommendation of a treating\nphysician. “)\nTo hold otherwise would be to countenance personal liability for the supervisor for the\nactions of those under his supervision.  Such a respondeat superior theory of personal liability has\nbeen consistently rejected by the Courts in the context of constitutional tort liability. Monell\nv. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978); Cameron v. Thornburgh, 983 F.2d 253, 258\n(D.C. Cir. 1993); Meyer v. Reno, 911 F. Supp. 11, 15 (D.D.C. 1996). See also, Simpkins v. District\nof Columbia Government, 108 F.3d 366, 369 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (\"Bivens claims cannot rest merely\non respondeat superior . . .

Cir. 1982); Tarpley v. Greene, 684 F.2d 1, 9-11 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  In Cameron, the\nD.C. Circuit dismissed the Attorney General and Director from the suit because the complaint failed\nto allege their personal involvement and was based solely “on the bare assumption” that policy\ndecisions in the District of Columbia influenced the prisoner’s treatment in a federal prison in\nIndiana.  Id. at 258.\n20\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 22 of 35(cid:10)\nIn the Meyer case, 911 F. Supp. at 15, this Court discussed respondeat superior within the\ncontext of federal inmate lawsuits:\nAbsent any allegations that defendants Reno and Hawk personally participated in the\nevents which gave rise to the plaintiff's claims, or any corroborative allegations to\nsupport the inference that these defendants had notice of or acquiesced in the\nimproper securing of detainers against the plaintiff by their subordinates, dismissal\nis appropriate.  See Haynesworth v. Miller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1259 (D.C. Cir. 1987)\n(fellow government employees cannot be held liable under the theory of respondeat\nsuperior for either constitutional or common law torts); Smith-Bey v. District of\nColumbia, 546 F. Supp. 813, 814 (D.D.C. 1982) (same).  Respondeat superior has\nbeen consistently rejected as a basis for the imposition of § 1983 or Bivens liability.\nSee, e.g., Monell v. Dep't of Social Srvcs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978); Rizzo v.\nGoode, 423 U.S. 362 (1976); Boykin v. District of Columbia, 689 F.2d 1092, 1097-\n99 (D.C. Cir. 1982); and Tarpley v. Greene, 684 F.2d 1, 9-11 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\nTherefore, any potential § 1983 or Bivens claims against these defendants, whose\nonly relationship to the instant litigation is their ultimate supervisory status, must be\ndismissed.\n\"Without a showing of direct responsibility for the improper action, liability will not lie against a\nsupervisory  official.    A  causal  connection,  or  an  affirmative  link,  between  the  misconduct\ncomplained of and the official sued is necessary.\"  Wolf-Lillie v. Sonquist, 699 F.2d 864, 869 (7th\nCir. 1983).  Individual liability for damages for violation of constitutional rights is predicated upon\npersonal responsibility.  Schultz v. Baumgart, 738 F.2d 231, 238 (7th Cir. 1984).  Hence, the\nPlaintiffs cannot have Mr. Dillard held individually and personally liable for his actions merely as\na supervisor.\nII.  Plaintiff Failed to State A Claim for Any Civil Rights Violation Under Section 1983\nSection 1983 provides:\nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or\nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be\nsubjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction\nthereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the\nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to the person injured in an action at law, suit\n21\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 23 of 35(cid:10)\nin equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought\nagainst a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer’s judicial\ncapacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was\nviolated or declaratory relief was unavailable.  For the purposes of this section, any\nAct  of  Congress  applicable  exclusively  to  the  District  of  Columbia  shall  be\nconsidered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (emphasis added).\nThus, § 1983 does not generally apply to federal officials acting under color of federal law.\nSee Daly-Murphy v. Winston, 837 F.2d 348, 355 (9th Cir. 1987).  Rather, by its terms, § 1983\napplies only to actions under color of state law and does not ordinarily provide a basis for claims\nagainst federal officials.  The only possible exception occurs when there is a conspiracy between\nstate and federal officials resulting in an abuse of authority derived from state law.  Kletschka v.\nDriver, 411 F.2d 436, 448 (2d Cir. 1969).  The legislative history clearly shows that Congress did\nnot intend for Section 1983 to apply against federal actors.  Instead, it was promulgated to provide\na measure of federal control over state officials who were either unwilling or unable to protect\ncertain individuals against the deprivation of their constitutional rights.  Section 1983 provided a\nremedy where none existed.  It provided a mechanism to protect against a state official’s conduct.\nFederal Defendant Todd Dillard, who is the former U.S. Marshal for the Superior Court of\nthe District of Columbia,  is named as a Section 1983 defendant.  In this capacity, however, Mr.\nDillard would have acted under color of federal law, specifically under color of 28 U.S.C. §§ 561-\n569.  It is worthy of note that the authority of United States Marshals and Deputy U.S. Marshals\nextends beyond the District of Columbia (or whatever district in which they primarily work), to any\nstate in which they may execute the laws of the United States.  28 U.S.C. § 564; United States v.\nBoettcher, 588 F.2d 89 (4th Cir. 1978) (U.S. Marshal may execute arrest warrants at any place within\n22\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 24 of 35(cid:10)\njurisdiction of the United States); United States v. Hanna, 114 WLR 1153 (Super. Ct. 1986) (noting\nextraterritorial nature of certain Superior Court warrants).\nCongress, in describing a 1979 amendment to Section 1983 “makes clear that Federal courts\nshall have jurisdiction of section 1983 actions against District of Columbia officials acting under\nauthority of local laws, even if those laws were passed by Congress.”  H.R. Rep. No. 96-548, at 2\n(1979), reprinted in 1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2609, 2610.\nThus, the words and history of Section 1983, including the 1979 amendment do not provide\nfor a cause of action under Section 1983 under the circumstances described in Plaintiffs’ Amended\nComplaint.  The purpose of Section 1983 was to provide a cause of action where there was none.\nIndeed, Congress in 1979 did just that when it again provided individuals within the District of\nColumbia with a remedy for the deprivation of protected rights where there was none before.  In the\ninstant case, Plaintiffs’ remedy, if one exists, was created by the Supreme Court in Bivens.  Under\nproper circumstances, Plaintiffs may pursue a Fourth Amendment claim under the Bivens doctrine\nagainst a federal employee in his or her individual capacity, but not a Section 1983 action.  See e.g.,\nBerry v. Funk, 146 F.3d 1003, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (noting that plaintiffs can bring Bivens actions\nagainst federal officials and section 1983 actions against state officials); McCord v.

Pape, 365\nU.S. 167, 187 (1961) (adopting Classic standard for purposes of § 1983) (overruled in part on other\ngrounds); Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 695-701 (1978)); Polk\nCounty v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 317-18 (1981).   \nThe Williams court held that a Section 1983 action could not be maintained against a special\npolice officer employed by the U.S. Government Printing Office, who allegedly unlawfully arrested\nappellant.  396 F.3d at 413.  The Government Printing Office is a federal agency which employed\nthe appellee as a special policeman.  Id.  Federal law authorized these policemen to \nmake arrest[s] for violations of laws of the United States, the several States, and the\nDistrict of Columbia; and enforce the regulations of the Public Printer, including the\nremoval from Government printing office premises of individuals who violate such\nregulations.  The jurisdiction of special policemen in premises occupied by or under\nthe control of the Government Printing Office and adjacent areas shall be concurrent\nwith the jurisdiction of the respective law enforcement agencies where the premises\nare located.  \nId. (citing 44 U.S.C. § 317).  Williams was arrested by Officer Hardwick and thereafter alleged the\ndeprivation of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights in violation of Section 1983.  The Court\nrejected Williams’ contention, holding that Williams could not maintain a cause of action against\nthe officer under Section 1983 and noting that “plaintiffs alleging abuse by federal officials are not\n24\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 26 of 35(cid:10)\nwithout a remedy. . . as Williams could have brought an action against Hardwick under Bivens. . .”\nId., at 416.  \nTo constitute state action, “the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or\nprivilege created by the State . . . or by a person for whom the State is responsible,” and “the party\ncharged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.”  Id.\n“[S]tate employment is generally sufficient to render the defendant a state actor.”  Lugar v.\nEdmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 936,  n. 18, 937 (1982); see also Williams, supra., at 414-16.\nMoreover, a defendant in a § 1983 suit acts under color of state law when he abuses the position\ngiven to him by the State.  See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. at 172.  Thus, generally, \"a public\nemployee acts under color of state law while acting in his official capacity or while exercising his\nresponsibilities pursuant to state law. See, e.g., Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535-536 (1981);\nAdickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 152 (1970).\nThe Ninth Circuit in Tongol v. Usery, 601 F.2d 1091 (9th Cir. 1979), discussed the “color\nof state law” requirement.  Tongol involved state officials who sought to recover overpayments of\nFederal Supplemental Benefits (“FSB”) under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act\nof 1974.  Id. at 1097.   The Court held that the state officials who sought to recover these FSB\noverpayments were empowered to act only by virtue of their authority under state law.  Id.  The\nCourt went on to hold that “the ‘color of state law’ requirement of section 1983 has consistently been\ntreated as the same thing as the ‘state action’ requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. [citations\nomitted].   Id. at 1095.  Courts applying the ‘color of state law’ requirement have indicated that the\nrelevant inquiry focuses not on whose law is being implemented, but rather on whether the authority\nof the state was exerted in enforcing the law. [citations omitted].”  Id. at 1097.  \n25\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 27 of 35(cid:10)\nThe Third Circuit has held that “there [i]s no set formula for determining whether the\nemployees of an agency with both state and federal characteristics must be examined to consider\nwhether the acts complained of were sufficiently linked to the state.”  Johnson v. Orr, 780 F.2d 386,\n390 (3rd Cir. 1986).  “A crucial inquiry is ‘whether day-to-day operations are supervised by the\nFederal [or state] government.’” United States v. Orleans, 425 U.S. 807, 815 (1976).  \nIn Case v. Milewski, 327 F. 3d 564, 567 (7th Cir. 2003), the court recognized two\ncircumstances in which a party may be found to act under color of state law.  The first is when the\nstates have cloaked the defendants in some degree of authority, normally through employment or\nsome other agency relationship.  Id. at 567; see Yang v. Hardin, 37 F.3d 282, 284 (7th Cir. 1994)\nfinding that Chicago police officers were acting under color of state law when “[t]hey were on duty,\nwearing Chicago police uniforms, driving a marked squad car and were investigating a crime.”);\nPickrel v. City of Springfield, Illinois, 45 F.3d 1115, 1118 (7th Cir. 1995) (finding an off-duty\nSpringfield, Illinois police officer could have been acting under color of state law because he was\nwearing his police uniform and displaying his badge.)\nThe second circumstance is when the defendants have conspired or acted in concert with state\nofficials to deprive a person of his civil rights.  In order to establish a conspiracy, the party must\ndemonstrate that the state officials and the private party somehow reached an understanding to deny\na party of his constitutional rights.  Case, 327 F.3d 564, 567 [citations omitted].  The court further\nacknowledged that “although an action brought pursuant to § 1983 cannot lie against federal officers\nacting under color of federal law, it is assumed that a § 1983 action can lie against federal employees\n. . . as it can against private individuals . . . if they conspire or act in concert with state officials to\ndeprive a person of her civil rights under color of state law.” (emphasis added).  \n26\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 28 of 35(cid:10)\nWhen distinguishing between federal and state actors, “[a] crucial inquiry is ‘whether day-to-\nday operations are supervised by the Federal [or state] government.’” Johnson v. Orr, 780 F.2d 386,\n390 (3rd Cir. 1986).  The Deputy Marshals are supervised and controlled by the USMS, not the\nDistrict of Columbia.  Even the D.C. Statute acknowledging that the USMS “serves the courts of the\nDistrict of Columbia,” also confirms that such service is “subject to the supervision of the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States.” D.C. Code § 11-1729.\nIn deed, Plaintiffs concede that “Defendant United States Marshals Service is an agency of\nthe federal government . . ..,” Am. Compl. at ¶ 56, and that “Defendant Todd Dillard is the United\nStates Marshal for the District of Columbia,” id. at ¶ 57.   Moreover, the Court need not accept legal\nconclusions cast in the form of factual allegations. Kowal v. MCI Communications Corp., 16 F.3d\n1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  Where the Court need only take judicial notice of the statutes\nproviding the authority for the U.S. Marshals to act, it is clear that there exists no factual dispute on\nthe issue.   Defendant Dillard, as a federal employee, was at all times acting under color of federal\nlaw.   Importantly, section 1983 does not apply to federal officials because they act purely under\ncolor of federal law.  See Williams v. United States, 396 F.3d at 414. See also Heck v. Humphrey,\n512 U.S. 477, 480 (1994) (stating that section 1983 provides access to a federal forum for claims of\nunconstitutional treatment at the hands of state officials); Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents,\n403 U.S. at 398 n.1 (“Petitioner also asserted federal jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28\nU.S.C. § 1343(3), and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(4). Neither will support federal jurisdiction over the\nclaim.”).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Section 1983 claim fails to state a claim against Defendant Dillard,\nbecause, at all times, he acted under federal, not state, law. \n27\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 29 of 35(cid:10)\n   III. There Is No Article III Jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ Claims  for Injunctive Relief\nAgainst the Marshal Service\nPlaintiffs have conceded that they have no colorable damages action against the USMS under\nSection 1983.  See Plaintiffs’ Notice, filed May 26, 2006 [dkt. no. 60].  Plaintiffs have affirmed their\nintention, however, to maintain their claim against the USMS for preliminary and permanent\ninjunctive relief.  Id.; see also Am. Compl. at 50.   Plaintiffs have done so notwithstanding their own\nadmission that the events to which the Amended Complaint refers “occurred before the last day of\nApril, 2003,” id. ¶ 3, and that in April, 2003, “the Federal Defendants represented [through their\nUnited States Justice Department attorneys] to the Plaintiffs and the Court that they stopped the strip\nsearch practices described herein,” id.   As discussed below, Plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief,\nin the form of an order “enjoin[ing] defendants from pursuing the course of conduct complained of\nherein,” id. at 50, is subject to dismissal as a matter of law for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\nbecause Plaintiffs lack standing to bring such a claim, and because any such claim would be moot.\n“The requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter ‘spring[s] from the\nnature and limits of the judicial power of the United States’ and is ‘inflexible and without\nexception.’”  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94-95 (1998), quoting\nMansfield, C. & L.M.R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379, 382 (1884).  A subsidiary threshold question,\nand a predicate to the determination of justiciability, is whether a plaintiff in federal court has\nstanding to sue, a requirement derived from Article III, § 2's  limitations of federal judicial power\nto cases or controversies. Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 101.  The \"irreducible constitutional minimum\"\nrequired to establish Article III standing consists of three components,  id. at 102-03, citing Lujan\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561 (1992): \n28\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 30 of 35(cid:10)\n--  “First and foremost, there must be alleged . . . an ‘injury in fact’ -- a harm suffered by the\nplaintiff that is ‘concrete’ and ‘actual or imminent,’ not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’”  Steel Co.,\n523 U.S. at 103, quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990), quoting  City of Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983).   The allegation of harm must be “particularized.” Lujan\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560-61.  \n--  Second, there must be alleged “a fairly traceable connection between the plaintiff’s injury\nand the complained-of conduct of the defendant.” Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 103, citing Simon v. Eastern\nKy. Welfare Rights Organiz., 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976). \n--  Third, “it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that the injury will be\nredressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560-61.                \nSee also Florida Audubon Soc. v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 661-62 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc).\nThe party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the elements of\nstanding. Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 103-04;  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 561.  The Court\nmust address standing before the merits. Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 100 n.3, 101.   \"[A]n inescapable\nresult of any standing doctrine application is that at least some disputes will not receive judicial\nreview.\" Fla. Audubon Soc., 94 F.3d at 665-66.  That the standing analysis \"should sometimes\ndictate this result is not a reason to reject either the result or the analysis.\" Id. \nRelated to Article III standing is the doctrine of mootness.  The mootness doctrine\nencompasses  circumstances  “that  destroy  the  justiciability  of  a  suit  previously  suitable  for\ndetermination.”  Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d §  3533\n(1984) at 211; Mahoney v. Babbitt, 113 F.3d 219, 220  (D.C. Cir. 1997).  The doctrine, also derived\nfrom Article III, limits federal courts to deciding actual continuing controversies. Mahoney v.\n29\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 31 of 35(cid:10)\nBabbitt, 113 F.3d at 220-21; Clarke v. United States, 915 F.2d 699, 700-01 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (en\nbanc)(“[e]ven where litigation poses a live controversy when filed, the doctrine requires a federal\ncourt to refrain from deciding it if ‘events have so transpired that the decision will neither presently\naffect the parties' rights nor have a more-than-speculative chance of affecting them in the future’\"),\nquoting Transwestern Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 897 F.2d 570, 575 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  See also Preiser\nv. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975); Tucker v. Phyfer, 819 F .2d 1030, 1033 (11th Cir. 1987) (“The\nmootness doctrine requires that the plaintiff’s controversy remain live throughout the litigation; once\nthe controversy ceases to exist, the court must dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction.”).\nPlaintiffs have not satisfied the requirements for Article III standing with respect to their\nclaim for injunctive relief against the Marshal Service.  In accordance with the standard for judicial\nreview of a motion filed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction, the Court must assume as true Plaintiffs’ factual allegations that all events to which the\nFirst Amended Complaint refers took place more than three years ago.  See First Amended\nComplaint ¶ 3.  The Court must also deem as true that defendants represented in  April 2003, through\nJustice Department counsel, that they had terminated the alleged “strip search practices described\nherein.” Id.  Having asserted those allegations, Plaintiffs’ failure to allege any fact giving rise to an\ninference that any such practice has continued at any time during the past three years, or that those\npractices are continuing today, constitutes an omission so conspicuous as to be dispositive of\njurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims for an order seeking that those practices be terminated.  \n For a claim to satisfy the requirements of standing, “it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely\n‘speculative,’ that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 560-61.  See also Florida Audubon Soc., 94 F.3d 661-62.   Plaintiffs’ alleged\n30\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 32 of 35(cid:10)\ninjuries would not be redressable by any prospective order of this Court requiring the termination\nof practices alleged to have been terminated three years ago.  No injury alleged in the complaint\nwould be redressed by such an order because all of the named class members were arrested and\nsubjected to the alleged unconstitutional searches years ago, and are no longer being subjected to any\nsuch alleged practices.  \nMoreover, Plaintiffs’ claim of entitlement to such an order is moot.  See e.g., People for the\nEthical Treatment of Animals v. Gittens, 396 F.3d 416, 421 (D.C.  Cir. 2005) (appeal from order\ngranting a preliminary injunction becomes moot when, because of the defendant’s compliance or\nsome  other  change  in  circumstances,  nothing  remains  to  be  enjoined  through  a  permanent\ninjunction).  Moreover, the mootness of Plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief could not be avoided\non any purported ground that the acts alleged as the basis of the named Plaintiffs’ injuries were\n“‘capable of repetition yet evading review.’” Gittens, 396 F.3d at 421, quoting S. Pac. Terminal Co.\nv. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911).  “One function of the ‘capable of repetition’ doctrine is to satisfy\nthe  Constitution’s  requirement,  set  forth  in  Article  III,  that  courts  resolve  only  continuing\ncontroversies.”  Gittens, 396 F.3d at 422.  “For a controversy or wrong to be ‘capable of repetition,’\nthere must be at least ‘a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected\nto the same action again.’” Id., citing Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147 (1975).   There is no\nreasonable expectation that the named plaintiffs will be arrested again, much less searched pursuant\nto an alleged practice the continuation of which is not even alleged in the Amended Complaint.  See\nAm. Compl. at ¶ 3.  Indeed, assuming the facts alleged to be true, the Court may reasonably infer,\nwithout going beyond the four corners of the Amended Complaint, that any such alleged practice has\nbeen terminated, and has been terminated for at least three years.  Because this is so, Plaintiffs’\n31\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 33 of 35(cid:10)\nclaims against the USMS for injunctive relief are jurisdictionally barred because Plaintiffs lack\nstanding to advance them and because they are moot.\nIV. Bivens Claims Are Untimely.\nDefendants submit that the one-year statute of limitations governs Plaintiffs’ Bivens claims.\nWhen a federal action contains no statute of limitations, courts will ordinarily\nlook to analogous provisions in state law as a source of a federal limitations period.\nSee, e.g., Burnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. ----, 104 S.Ct. 2924, 2929, 82 L.Ed.2d 36\n(1984);  Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 464, 95 S.Ct. 1716,\n1722, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975);    Brown v. United States, 742 F.2d 1498, 1503 (D.C.\nCir. 1984) (en banc).  Concluding that \"damage to reputation ... is central to the\n[plaintiff's] claim,\" Opinion at 2, the district court applied the District of Columbia's\none year statute of limitations governing defamation actions to Doe's Bivens suit.\nSee D.C. Code § 12-301(4).  The D.C. statute of limitations reads, in relevant part:\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided by law, actions for the following  purposes\nmay not be brought after the expiration of the period specified below from the time\nthe right to maintain the action accrues:. . .(4) for libel, slander, assault, battery,\nmayhem, wounding, malicious prosecution, false arrest or false imprisonment -- 1\nyear; . . .(8) for which a limitation is not otherwise specially prescribed--3 years.\nD.C. Code § 12-301.  We agree with the district court that the one year limitations\nperiod should be applied.\nDoe v. United States Department of Justice, 753 F.2d 1092, 1114 & n.28 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (footnote\ninserted into text).  Here, the allegedly unlawful action took place as early as 1999, i.e., three years\nprior to the filing of the Complaint.  See Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 3, 20 & 33.  The original complaint was\nnot filed until 2002, well beyond the one-year limitations period for many of the claims.\nFederal Defendants recognize that the Supreme Court has reached a different conclusion in\naddressing Section 1983 actions.  See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 271-72 (1985) (applying\nstatutory construction principles to Section 1983 and concluding that the personal injury limitations\nperiod would presumably apply).  A Bivens action, however, is not created by statute; and Plaintiffs’\nclaims are most like those described in D.C. Code § 12-301(4). See Banks v. Chesapeake and\n32\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 34 of 35(cid:10)\nPotomac Telephone Co.,  802 F.2d 1416, 1429,  (D.C. Cir. 1986) (citing McClam, 697 F.2d at\n372-74).  Courts in other jurisdictions have, in Federal Defendants’ view, incorrectly assumed that\nthe statutory analysis applied in Wilson should also be applied in the Bivens context.  See e.g., Harris\nv. United States,  422 F.3d 322, 331 (6th Cir. 2005).  To Defendants’ knowledge this Circuit has not\naccepted this invitation to treat Bivens claims as if they were subject to the statutory analysis applied\nin Wilson.  Bivens claims are uniquely creatures of Federal common law, and as such they cannot\nand should not be treated uniformly, as contemplated in Wilson.  Instead, local law has elected to\nseparate common law claims as subject to differing limitations periods, depending on the nature of\nthe claim.  This practice should continue to be followed unless and until the District of Columbia\nadopts a separate limitations period for Bivens claims.  See Banks v. Chesapeake and Potomac\nTelephone Co., 802 F.2d at 1429;  McClam v. Barry, 697 F.2d 366, 372-74 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (false\narrest claim most closely analogous to a claim under D.C. Code § 12-301(4)).  Thus, all Bivens\nclaims that were over one year old when this action was commenced are subject to dismissal as\nuntimely.\n33\n\nCase 1:02-cv-02364-RMC     Document 62-1     Filed 05/31/2006     Page 35 of 35(cid:10)\nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE, Federal Defendants respectfully submit that this motion to dismiss should\nbe granted.\nRespectfully submitted,\n                                      /s/                                          \nKENNETH L.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n)\nDIANNA JOHNSON, et al., )\n)\nPlaintiffs, )\n)\nv. ) Civil Action No. 02-2364 (RMC)\n)\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT )\nOF COLUMBIA, et al., )\n)\nDefendants. )\n)\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nIt is alleged that the United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of\nColumbia directed a blanket policy and/or practice whereby all female arrestees—but not male\narrestees—were subjected to “drop, squat and cough” strip searches before presentment to a judicial\nofficial.  Approximately 16,000 women who were arrested for non-drug and non-violent offenses,\nsuch as traffic stops and other minor offenses, between December 2, 1999, and April 25, 2003,\ncomplain here that this blanket policy and/or practice violated their rights to be free from\nunreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment and their rights to equal protection under the\nFifth Amendment to the Constitution.  Former Superior Court Marshal Todd Dillard, sued here in\nhis individual capacity, asserts that his official search policy for the D.C. Superior Court cellblock\nwas gender neutral; that he intended the policy to apply identically to both male and female arrestees;\nthat he was unaware if his policy were being contravened by those conducting the searches; and that,\nin any event, he is entitled to qualified immunity.\nIn other litigation, the United States Marshals Service formally conceded that the\n\npractice at the Superior Court cellblock in 2000 and 2001 was to subject all female arrestees to a\nblanket drop, squat and cough search while male arrestees underwent the same search only upon\nindividualized suspicion.  Former Marshal Dillard disputes the accuracy of this concession.  The\nsearch practices at the Superior Court during the class period are very much contested.  However,\nin light of the government’s past formal admissions and record evidence in Clifton v. U.S., No. 02-\n0578 (D.D.C. filed Mar. 26, 2002) and Helton v. U.S., No. 01-0385 (D.D.C. filed Feb. 20, 2001),\nwhich similarly involved strip searches at the D.C. Superior Court cellblock, and the record before\nthis Court, it is evident that during the class period female arrestees were subjected to a blanket\npractice of strip searches while many, if not most, male arrestees were not.  Nonetheless, it is now\nclear that former Marshal Dillard is entitled to qualified immunity from the Fourth Amendment\nclaims.  The Fifth Amendment claims similarly fail as Plaintiffs proffer no evidence that former\nMarshal Dillard purposefully discriminated by intending a gender disparity in search procedures.\nI.  FACTS\nA.  The Searches  \nPlaintiffs complain of strip searches (“strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches”)\nto which they were subjected at the District of Columbia Superior Court cellblock while waiting for\npresentment before a judge or other judicial officer.  Second Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 117] ¶ 1.  Similar\nstrip searches were complained of in Clifton v. U.S. and Helton v. U.S., both of which settled with\nentry of a court order and injunction.  Defendant Todd Dillard was the United States Marshal for the\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia from approximately October 1990 to 2004, and,\naccordingly, the Superior Court Marshal for the periods covered by both Clifton and Helton and the\nentirety of the Fourth and Fifth Amendment class period, which runs from December 1999 to April\n-2-\n\n2003.\nAs described by the United States Marshals Service (the “Service”), in 2001 all\nprisoners brought to the Superior Court cellblock first passed through a magnetometer and then\nunderwent an “in-custody search,” whereby they removed the contents of their pockets, had their\nouter clothing inspected, removed their shoes, and were thoroughly patted down.  See Pls.’ Mem.\nin Supp. of Mot. for Partial Summ. J. [Dkt. # 233], [Attach. 82] Marshal Service Interrog. Resp. in\nClifton v. U.S. ¶ 8.  After the “in-custody search,” male detainees were then placed in a cell unless\na detainee presented individualized suspicion that he had contraband on his person or posed other\nrisk, in which event he was held aside to be subjected to “a more thorough search.”  Id.  \nHowever, as the Service described the strip search practice that existed in 2001, it was\nmarkedly different for female detainees:\nAfter the in-custody search, female detainees are then moved to an\nenclosed area separate and apart from male detainees.  Only female\ndetainees or officers are allowed in this area; no male detainees or\nofficers may inadvertently or casually look into the area; and there are\nno closed-circuit televisions or other video recording devices present. \nOne further step is required for female detainees since the pat-down\nsearch cannot reasonably ascertain whether there are weapons or\ncontraband secreted in the brassiere or the vagina.\nThe female detainee herself is asked to grasp her brassiere through\nher outer clothing and move it or shake it in a manner designed to\ndislodge any weapon or contraband that may be hidden there.  The\ndetainee is then asked to face a wall, lower her pants and underwear,\nand “squat and cough”.  The detainee squats by lowering her body\nfrom an upright standing position until her upper legs are parallel to\nthe floor.  A female [officer] observes this procedure, which lasts 2\nto 3 seconds, from a distance of about 10 feet from the detainee.  At\nno time does the female [officer] closely view any detainee’s orifices.\nFemale detainees are subjected to this final step primarily because of\nthe history of discovery of contraband and weapons hidden in the\n-3-\n\nvagina of women who arrive in the United States Marshals Service’s\ncellblock  from  the  District  of  Columbia  jail  or  the  District  of\nColumbia  Metropolitan  Police  Department,  and  because  of  the\nrelative ease with which contraband or weapons can be secreted in the\nvagina or sanitary napkins.\nId. (describing practice that existed on June 29, 2001); see also Pls.’ Mem., [Attach. 73] Marshal\nService Interrog. Resp. in Helton v. U.S. ¶ 8 (describing identical practice being in existence on\nFebruary 21, 2000); Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 133–35 (detailing the complained of drop, squat and\ncough searches).  Thus, when sued in separate suits in 2001 and 2002, the Service formally admitted\nthrough sworn interrogatory responses that the Superior Court Marshal had a blanket practice of\ndrop, squat and cough searches of all female prisoners, but  not  of male  prisoners without\nindividualized suspicion. \nThis case did not proceed immediately because, on April 25, 2003, the parties agreed\nto a temporary standstill to pursue settlement discussions and the Service vowed, \nin response to the injunctive relief claims contained in the\ncomplaint herein and plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, the Federal Defendants will have implemented\nby Monday, April 28, 2003, new security policies and\npractices  that  will  (i)  permit  “drop,  squat  and  cough”\nsearches  or  a  strip  search  only,  at  the  least,  upon  an\nindividualized  finding  of  reasonable  suspicion,  if  not\nprobable cause, and with the approval of a supervisor; and\n(ii) insure that such searches will be applied even-handedly\nto both men and women arrestees and detainees.\nSee Consent Mot. to Hold Mots. in Abeyance Pending Settlement Discussions [Dkt. # 24] at 2. \nDespite Clifton and Helton, Marshal Dillard insists that he had a blanket policy at the Superior Court\nthroughout the class period of subjecting all arrestees, regardless of gender, to drop, squat and cough\nsearches.  See Def.’s Notice of Dep. Excerpts [Dkt. # 240] (“Dep. Excerpts”), [Attach. 9] Todd\n-4-\n\nDillard Dep. (Nov. 20, 2009) at 92–93, 96–98; see also id., [Attach. 14] Thomas Hedgepeth Dep.\n(July 17, 2007) at 220–23 (corroborating that official policy throughout class period was that all\nprisoners were to be drop, squat and cough searched).  Following voluminous discovery, the record\nreveals that the practice employed by Superior Court employees in conducting strip searches was not\ngender neutral.1  Were just the practice itself at issue, Marshal Dillard’s current testimony would\nneed to be evaluated by a jury, since it is irreconcilably at odds with the Service’s prior sworn\nresponses and the instant record.  However, in light of recent D.C. Circuit case law, the Court must\nconclude that Marshal Dillard enjoys qualified immunity from Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims\nand that, without evidence that Marshal Dillard himself acted with discriminatory purpose by\nsubjecting male and female arrestees to different strip search procedures, the Fifth Amendment\nclaims must also be dismissed. \nB.  Procedural History\nThis lawsuit was initially brought against the District of Columbia, the United States\nMarshals Service, former Superior Court Marshal Todd Dillard in his individual capacity, and\nvarious John Doe deputy Marshals.  The parties spent the time between April 2003 and April 2006\nattempting to settle.  When those efforts failed, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on April\n28, 2006.  See First Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 58].  On November 14, 2006, the Court denied defense\nmotions to dismiss and found that Marshal Dillard was not entitled to qualified immunity on the\nFourth and Fifth Amendment constitutional claims.  See Order Denying Defs.’ Mots. to Dismiss\n1 Several Deputy Marshals testified that they did not consider a drop, squat and cough search\nto be a “strip search” since the arrestee did not become completely nude in the search; a woman kept\nher shirt on, albeit pulled up, and only had to drop her pants and underwear low enough to allow her\nto squat and cough.  In this Opinion, as in the briefs and prior cases, the terms “strip search” and\n“drop, squat and cough search” are used interchangeably.\n-5-\n\n[Dkt. # 81] at 3.  \nPlaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on May 24, 2007.  See Second Am.\nCompl.  Plaintiffs abandoned their claims against the various John Doe Deputy Marshals in the\nSecond Amended Complaint but added claims against Marshal Dillard in his official capacity.  See\nid.  In 2008, the Court certified separate Fourth and Fifth Amendment classes and dismissed the\nService as a defendant, finding that Plaintiffs lacked standing to seek equitable relief from it.  See\nMem. Op. & Order [Dkts. ## 158, 159].  The Court also denied Plaintiffs’ request to certify an\nalternative Fourth Amendment class which would have included both male and female arrestees. \nSee id.  In 2008, the Court dismissed the District of Columbia, finding that it could not be liable to\nPlaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 because Marshal Dillard was a federal official acting\nunder the color of federal law.  See Mem. Op. & Order [Dkts. ## 202, 203].  In 2010, the Court\ndenied Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint.  See Order [Dkt. # 226].  \nOn April 5, 2010, following extensive discovery, Plaintiffs moved for partial\nsummary judgment, see Pls.’ Mot. [Dkt. # 233], and Marshal Dillard cross-moved for judgment on\nthe pleadings, or in the alternative, for summary judgment.  See Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt.\n# 232].  Oral argument was heard on September 24, 2010, and October 28, 2010.  At oral argument\non September 24, 2010, the Court reaffirmed its finding that Marshal Dillard had acted under color\nof federal law as the United States Marshal for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for\nthe same reasons outlined in its prior Order, see Mem. Op. & Order [Dkts. ## 202, 203], and\ndismissed all claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 against Marshal Dillard.  Thus, remaining\nbefore the Court are claims against Marshal Dillard in his personal capacity alone for alleged\nviolations of Plaintiffs’ Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. \n-6-\n\nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nUnder Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment shall be\ngranted “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant\nis entitled to judgement as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986).  “[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties\nwill not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is\nthat there be no genuine issue of material fact.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247–48.  Moreover, summary\njudgment is properly granted against a party who “after adequate time for discovery and upon motion\n. . . fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s\ncase, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317, 322 (1986).  \nIn ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all justifiable\ninferences in the nonmoving party’s favor and accept the nonmoving party’s evidence as true. \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255.  A nonmoving party, however, must establish more than “the mere\nexistence of a scintilla of evidence” in support of its position.  Id. at 252.  In addition, the nonmoving\nparty may not rely solely on allegations or conclusory statements.  See Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d\n671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  Rather, the nonmoving party must present specific facts that would\nenable a reasonable jury to find in its favor.  Id. at 675.  If the evidence “is merely colorable, or is\nnot significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249–50\n(citations omitted); see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586\n(1986) (noting that when a movant has satisfied his burden under Rule 56, the “opponent must do\nmore than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts”).\n-7-\n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\nA.  Fourth Amendment Claims\nThe Fourth Amendment Class consists of :\nEach woman who, during the Class Period (December 2,\n1999, until April 25, 2003), was, (I) held in the Superior\nCourt Cell Block; (ii) awaiting presentment under a statute\nof the District of Columbia on either (a) a non-drug, non-\nviolent  traffic  offense;  (b)  a  non-drug,  non-violent\nmisdemeanor; or © a non-drug, non-violent felony; and\n(iii) subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or\nsquat search; (iv) without any individualized finding of\nreasonable  suspicion  or  probable  cause  that  she  was\nconcealing drugs, weapons or other contraband.\nSee Order Certifying Class [Dkt. # 159] at 1.  Following arrest, these women were brought to the\nSuperior Court cellblock from any of the seven Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”) stations,\nsubstations, traffic stations, or MPD’s central cellblock for presentment before a judicial officer.  The\nwomen were arrested by MPD, the Capitol Police, the Park Police, or any of the myriad of law\nenforcement entities that have authority to arrest in the District of Columbia.  Typically, if a person\nwere arrested before three p.m., she would be brought to the Superior Court cellblock the same day;\nif she were arrested after three p.m., she would generally be taken to the MPD central cellblock to\nspend the night and would be brought to the Superior Court cellblock early the following morning.\nArrestees were typically searched a few times before being brought to the Superior\nCourt—usually by the arresting officer/s at the scene of arrest, again at the MPD district station, and\nthen again before being placed on a van to be transported by MPD to the Superior Court cellblock. \nThese searches were generally pat-downs.  Arrestees were brought to the Superior Court cellblock\nwhere they would be held until their presentment to a judicial officer.  Also temporarily in custody\n-8-\n\nat the Superior Court cellblock awaiting a court hearing would have been convicted prisoners and\npre-trial criminal defendants transported from Lorton Correctional Center (which closed in 2001),\nthe D.C. Jail, or the Correctional Treatment Facility (collectively the “jail cases”).  Female arrestees\nand female jail cases were held in separate cells and were not co-mingled.  Plaintiffs’ Fourth and\nFifth Amendment classes are made up exclusively of female arrestees, not female jail cases. \nArrestees in the Superior Court cellblock were searched primarily by Detention\nEnforcement Officers (“DEOs”) and, to a slightly lesser extent, Deputy Marshals (“deputies”). \nSupervisors would intermittently assist in the searches if necessary.  Arrestees brought into the\ncellblock would typically pass through a magnetometer and undergo a thorough pat-down search\nbefore (or after) being placed in the search room designated for their gender.  Although pat-downs\nor lesser-degree searches could occur in the hallways or more public areas of the cellblock, female\narrestees were subjected to drop, squat and cough searches only in the female search room.  There\nis no allegation that a male was ever present during any of the female drop, squat and cough\nsearches. \nThe Superior Court cellblock was for temporary custody only; if arrestees were not\nreleased by a judicial officer directly from the courtroom after presentment, they would be\ntransferred to the D.C. Jail, where further body searches would occur.  Jail cases stayed in the\ncellblock only as needed for their court hearings and were transferred back from whence they came\nby day’s end.  No arrestee or jail case remained in the Superior Court cellblock overnight.  While\nthe exact statistics over the entirety of the class period were not maintained and are contested by\nMarshal Dillard, it appears that a significant portion, if not the majority, of female arrestees were\ntypically released from custody immediately from the courtroom in which they were arraigned,\n-9-\n\nwithout having to return to the cellblock.\nDuring the entirety of the class period, the standard under which body searches were\nto be conducted was officially governed by U.S. Marshals Service Policy Directive 99-25.  Policy\nDirective 99-25 was issued Service-wide to “All U.S. Marshals Employees,” with a cover memo\ndated July 15, 1999.  See Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 232], [Attach. 2] Policy\nDirective 99-25.  The purpose of the directive was to provide “specific instructions to U.S. Marshals\nService (USMS) employees for determining if, and under what conditions, body searches are legally\npermissible and how they will be conducted.”  Id. at I.  Policy Directive 99-25 was gender neutral\nand laid out various factors an officer could consider in determining whether reasonable suspicion\nexisted that a prisoner were carrying contraband or presented other risk (i.e. security, escape, suicide)\nto justify a strip search.  Id. at IV(C)(1).  Among the factors to be considered were the history of\ndiscovery of contraband on an individual prisoner or in a particular institution, and the type and\nsecurity level of the particular institution in which the prisoner was held.  See id.  Policy Directive\n99-25 was in effect from July 15, 1999 to October 6, 2003.  \nMarshal Dillard asserts that the Superior Court search policy in place throughout the\nclass period was that every prisoner, both male and female, arrestee and jail case, was to be subjected\nto a blanket strip search.  See Dillard Dep. at 92–93, 96–98.  The record reveals that during the class\nperiod the day-to-day practice at the cellblock mirrored Marshal Dillard’s asserted policy only as to\nfemale arrestees, who were, in fact, all subjected to drop, squat and cough searches.2\n2 Approximately fourteen female DEOs and deputies who conducted strip searches of female\narrestees at the Superior Court cellblock were deposed and uniformly testified that during the class\nperiod the practice was to subject every female arrestee to a drop, squat and cough search.  See e,g.,\nPls.’ Mem., [Attach. 29] Michelle Alexander Dep. (Aug. 28, 2007) at 35–38, 45–46 (searches from\napproximately February 2002 to March 2003); id., [Attach. 70] Jacqueline Hargrove Dep. from\n-10-\n\nPlaintiffs  first  allege  that  the  blanket  drop,  squat  and  cough  searches  were\nunreasonable for women arrested for non-drug and non-violent offenses and, therefore, violative of\nthe Fourth Amendment.3  Plaintiffs sue Marshal Dillard in his personal capacity for these alleged\nviolations.  A plaintiff may bring a claim for money damages against a federal official in his\nindividual capacity for a violation of the plaintiff’s constitutional rights.  Bivens v. Six Unknown\nNamed Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 389 (1971).  A federal agency is not\na proper defendant under Bivens.  See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 484–86 (1994); Gabriel v.\nCorrections Corp. of America, 211 F. Supp. 2d 132, 137 n.7 (D.D.C. 2003).  Marshal Dillard moves\nfor summary judgment that the blanket policy of conducting drop, squat and cough searches on\narrestees entering the Superior Court cellblock did not violate the Fourth Amendment and that, in\nany event, he is entitled to qualified immunity.4\nClifton v. U.S. (Sept. 18, 2002) at 8–9 (approximately 1995 to September 2002); id., [Attach. 49]\nPenelope Knox Dep. (Oct. 5, 2009) at 22–26 (approximately October 2000 to 2004); id., [Attach.\n58] Debora Seifert Dep. (Aug. 28, 2009) at 67–69 (approximately August 1998 to August 2001); but\nsee Dep. Excerpts, [Attach. 5] Tracy Bryce Dep. (Aug. 16, 2007) at 75–77 (testifying that she\nbelieved the blanket drop, squat and cough searches of female arrestees ended around 2000). \nMarshal Dillard concedes this point, but points to a Fourth Amendment class representative who\ncould not recall whether she received a drop, squat and cough search for both of her arrests, rather\nthan for just one.  See Def.’s Mem. at 29.  The class representative did not testify affirmatively that\nshe was not strip searched both times, and it is unclear whether both of her arrests occurred during\nthe class period.  See Pls.’ Reply [Dkt. # 251] at 2.  This possible incident does not negate the\nconsistent practice revealed by the overwhelming testimony.\n3 Plaintiffs moved to amend their Complaint to add a claim that the non-private setting in\nwhich the female arrestees were made to drop, squat and cough—in a female search room in front\nof other female arrestees—was an unreasonable time, place, and/or manner in which to conduct the\nsearches under the Fourth Amendment.  The Court denied Plaintiffs’ request.  See Order [Dkt.\n# 226].\n4 Marshal Dillard also moves for dismissal of all claims by Plaintiff Donna Curtis for failure\nto prosecute, as she failed to attend a scheduled deposition, and to dismiss Plaintiffs Dianna Johnson\nand Carolyn Montgomery, for whom a suggestion of death has been filed.  See Def.’s Mem. at\n-11-\n\nOn November 14, 2006, in denying the various defendants’ motions to dismiss, this\nCourt agreed with Plaintiffs that, if the facts proved to be as alleged, a violation of the Fourth and\nFifth Amendments would be shown and Marshal Dillard was not entitled to qualified immunity.\nHere,  the  First  Amended  Complaint  alleges  that  U.S.\nMarshals – at the direction of and pursuant to a policy\ndeveloped by former Marshal Dillard – subjected [female\narrestees] to blanket strip searches and visual cavity searches\nwithout a reasonable individualized suspicion that [they]\nwere concealing weapons or contraband. . . . [and that] all\nfemale arrestees at the D.C. Superior Court were subjected\nto  blanket  strip  searches,  but  similarly  situated  male\narrestees were not strip searched.  These allegations, if true,\nadequately  allege  violations  of  the  Fourth  and  Fifth\nAmendments.\nOrder Denying Defs.’ Mots. to Dismiss [Dkt. # 81] at 2–3.  \nIn 2006, when the Court decided that Plaintiffs had adequately alleged unreasonable\n40–42; see also Suggestion of Death [Dkt. # 215].  Plaintiffs do not oppose dismissal if it is without\nprejudice.  See Pls.’ Supplemental Opp’n [Dkt. # 244] at 2.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs Donna Curtis,\nDianna Johnson, and Carolyn Montgomery will be dismissed without prejudice.  \nIn addition, Marshal Dillard moves to dismiss Plaintiff Rabbiyah Muhammad for failure to\nprosecute because of her failure to submit timely sworn interrogatory responses, or as a sanction for\nthe same.  It is alleged that Ms. Muhammad submitted unsigned interrogatory responses and at her\ndeposition denied that she had ever seen the unsworn responses attributed to her.  Def.’s Mem. at\n42.  Her sworn responses were not received until after her deposition.  Marshal Dillard argues\nprejudice because he “was unable to fully address the inconsistencies between the interrogatory\nresponses and Ms. Muhammad’s testimony during her deposition, and thus was deprived of the\nopportunity to impeach Ms. Muhammad with contradictory sworn testimony.”  Def.’s Reply [Dkt.\n# 250] at 44.  Based on counsels’ arguments, it appears that any untimeliness on Ms. Muhammad’s\npart was mere inadvertence, and not sufficiently delayed or negligent as to warrant dismissal for\nfailure to prosecute.  Adjudication of claims on the merits is preferable and “‘dismissal is a sanction\nof last resort to be applied only after less dire alternatives have been explored without success’ or\nwould obviously prove futile.”  Shea v. Donohoe Constr. Co., 795 F.2d 1071, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 1986)\n(quoting Trakas v. Quality Brands, Inc., 759 F.2d 185, 186–87 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  Marshal Dillard\nhas not been prejudiced “so severely” as to warrant the drastic sanction of dismissing Ms.\nMuhammad.  See Shea, 795 F.2d at 1074.  The motion to dismiss Rabbiyah Muhammad will be\ndenied. \n-12-\n\nsearches under the Fourth Amendment, ten of twelve U.S. Courts of Appeals5 had ruled, with only\ninsignificant differences, that the blanket strip search of pretrial detainees, arrested for minor\noffenses and lacking any individualized suspicion, violated the Fourth Amendment.6  In 2006,\nhowever, the D.C. Circuit had not yet spoken to the question.  The ten circuits that had found such\nsearches to violate the Fourth Amendment were interpreting and applying Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S.\n520 (1979), which established a balancing test to determine when a strip search in the context of\ndetention is valid under the Fourth Amendment.  Bell considered a challenge to a Bureau of Prisons’\npolicy at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City, whereby every federal detainee\nwas required to undergo a visual body-cavity strip search following any contact visit with an\noutsider.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 558.  After acknowledging a body cavity search “instinctively gives us\nthe most pause,” id. at 558, the Supreme Court explained, “we deal here with the question whether\nvisual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by the [Metropolitan Correctional Center] rules can\never be conducted on less than probable cause.  Balancing the significant and legitimate security\ninterests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.” \nId. at 560. \nSince  this  Court’s  ruling  in  2006,  two  circuits  have  re-visited  their  prior\n5 Excluding the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n6 See, e.g., Roberts v.

Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th Cir. 1984); Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343\n(11th Cir. 2001).\n-13-\n\ninterpretations of Bell v. Wolfish.  Marshal Dillard holds up Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th\nCir. 2008) (en banc) and Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010) (en\nbanc).  In Powell, the Eleventh Circuit reversed course and determined that the Fourth Amendment,\nunder its revised interpretation of Bell, does not preclude a policy or practice “of strip searching all\narrestees as part of the process of booking them into the general population of a detention facility,\neven without reasonable suspicion.”  Powell, 541 F.3d at 1300.  Likewise, the Ninth Circuit reversed\nits earlier interpretation of Bell and held that a policy “requiring strip searches of all arrestees\nclassified for custodial housing in the general population was facially reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment, notwithstanding the lack of individualized suspicion as to the individuals searched.” \nBull, 595 F.3d at 982.  After the parties filed briefs in this matter, the Third Circuit weighed in for\nthe first time and similarly found the blanket strip search of arrestees prior to introduction into a\ngeneral jail population did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  See Florence v. Bd. of Chosen\nFreeholders, 621 F.3d 296 (3d. Cir. 2010).7  \nMarshal Dillard argues that these new decisions illustrate that the challenged search\npractice at the Superior Court perfectly accorded with Bell v. Wolfish and did not violate the Fourth\nAmendment, and/or that he reasonably could not have known that such searches violated the\nConstitution.  For reasons described below, the Court bypasses the question of whether Marshal\n7 But see Jimenez v. Wood County, 621 F.3d 372, 375 (5th Cir. 2010) (rejecting request that\nthe circuit revisit its earlier interpretation of Bell v. Wolfish in light of Bull and Powell and\nreaffirming Fifth Circuit precedent that “a strip search of an individual arrested for a minor offense\nmust be premised on reasonable suspicion that the detainee is carrying weapons or contraband”);\nStearns v. Clarkson, 615 F.3d 1278, 1282 (10th Cir. 2010) (finding official not entitled to qualified\nimmunity because under Tenth Circuit precedent “it is also clearly established that ‘a detainee who\nis not placed in the general prison population cannot be strip searched if the searching officer does\nnot at least have reasonable suspicion that the detainee possesses concealed weapons, drugs, or\ncontraband’”) (quoting Archuleta v. Wagner, 523 F.3d 1278, 1286 (10th Cir. 2008)).  \n-14-\n\nDillard violated Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights, addressing instead his right to qualified\nimmunity, even assuming all of Plaintiffs’ allegations are true.\nQualified immunity is “a defense that shields officials from suit if their conduct ‘d[id]\nnot violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known.’”  Ortiz v. Jordan, 131 S. Ct. 884, 888 (2011) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n800, 818 (1982)).  “In developing the doctrine of qualified immunity, the Supreme Court has sought\nto strike a balance ‘between the interests in vindication of citizens’ constitutional rights and in public\nofficials’ effective performance of their duties.’”  Int’l Action Ctr. v. United States, 365 F.3d 20, 24\n(D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639 (1987)).  A federal official can\nbe liable individually but “that official must have violated a constitutional right, and that right must\nhave been ‘clearly established’ – ‘the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable\nofficial would understand what he is doing violates that right.’”  Id. (quoting Anderson, 483 U.S. at\n640).\nTraditionally, looking at the facts alleged in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, a\ncourt  would  first  decide  whether  “the  facts  alleged  show  the  officer’s  conduct  violated  a\nconstitutional right,” and, only if so, “whether that right was clearly established” at the time of the\nviolation.  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).  The Supreme Court has since instructed that\na court can employ its discretion to decide in which sequence to address these two inquiries. \nPearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 818 (2009).  Because the D.C. Circuit has very recently made\n“plain that a constitutional right” as alleged by Plaintiffs “is not clearly established,” id., it is prudent\nfor this Court to proceed directly to qualified immunity.\nOn March 25, 2011, the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision directly on\n-15-\n\npoint.  See Bame v. Dillard, No. 9-5330, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 6207 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 25, 2011 as\namended Mar. 31, 2011).  The Bame plaintiffs, all males, had filed a class action against Marshal\nDillard for strip searches, including drop, squat and cough searches, conducted in 2002 following\nmass arrests of peaceful protesters.  Plaintiffs argued they were unconstitutionally searched and that\nMarshal Dillard was not entitled to qualified immunity as the unanimity in the circuits in 2002 made\nclear that the Fourth Amendment “prohibited strip searching a person arrested for a non-violent, non-\ndrug-related misdemeanor absent a particularized reason to suspect the arrestee was concealing\ncontraband or weapons about his person.”  Id. at *1–2.  Under the principle of constitutional\navoidance, the D.C. Circuit proceeded directly to the question of whether the constitutional right\ninvoked by the plaintiffs was clearly established at the time of the searches.  The Circuit noted: \n“‘There are cases in which it is plain that a constitutional right is not clearly established but far from\nobvious whether in fact there is such a right.’  This is such a case.”  Id. at *8 (quoting Pearson, 129\nS. Ct. at 818).\nThe D.C. Circuit concluded that Marshal Dillard was entitled to qualified immunity\nin Bame because “the law in 2002 did not clearly establish that strip searching all male arrestees prior\nto placement in holding cells at the Superior Court violated the Fourth Amendment.”  Id. at *13. \n“The governing precedent was then, as it is now, Bell v. Wolfish, and nothing in Bell requires\nindividualized, reasonable suspicion before strip searching a person entering a detention facility.” \nId.  “To the contrary, as the Eleventh Circuit would later point out, ‘The Bell decision means that the\nFourth Amendment does not require reasonable suspicion for this type of strip search in detention\nfacilities.’”  Id. (quoting Powell, 541 F.3d at 1308).\nThe facts alleged by Plaintiffs are not sufficiently distinguishable from Bame to allow\n-16-\n\na different result.  The Bame plaintiffs contested blanket strip searches of non-violent, non-drug\nrelated misdemeanor arrestees absent any individualized suspicion at the D.C. Superior Court\ncellblock, see id. at *2–3, as do Plaintiffs here.8  The D.C. Circuit explicitly dispatched with the\nappellees’ arguments—which Plaintiffs repeat here—that: (1) the law was clear in 2002 that this type\nof search was unconstitutional because ten circuits had spoken unanimously to that effect; and (2)\nMarshal Dillard should not be able to rely upon Powell or Bull or other circuit decisions not decided\nuntil 2008 as evidence that the law was insufficiently clear in 2002.  See id. at *10–13.  “That Powell\nand  Bull  came  down  after  2002  is  of  no  moment;  those  opinions  simply  accord  with  our\nunderstanding that Bell did not establish the unconstitutionality of a strip search under conditions\nlike those present here.”  Id. at *14.9  \nPlaintiffs’ additional arguments fare no better.  It is arguable that Powell, Bull, and\nFlorence are distinguishable from cases involving Superior Court arrestees, because the prisoners\nbefore those circuits were about to be entered into, or co-mingled with, a general jail or detention\nfacility population and most Plaintiffs here were only held temporarily at the D.C. Superior Court\nand then either released from the courtroom the same day or transferred to the D.C. Jail, a true\n8 The Fourth Amendment class here includes women arrested for non-drug, non-violent\ntraffic offenses, misdemeanors, and/or felonies, and while the Bame decision spoke of those arrested\nfor non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor offenses, its holding did not hinge on the type of\nviolation or crime for which a plaintiff was arrested, but extended to all persons being introduced\ninto the D.C. Superior Court cellblock, found by the D.C. Circuit to constitute a “detention facility.” \nSee id. at *13.\n9 But see id. at *42 (Rogers, J., dissenting) (“Marshal Dillard’s reliance on post-2002\ndecisions is doubly flawed.  Under Supreme Court qualified immunity precedent, circuit court of\nappeals decisions since the strip searches at issue in 2002 have no bearing on whether he is entitled\nto qualified immunity on the ground that there was no clearly established law to be followed in 2002. \nBut taken on their own merit the post-2002 cases are distinguishable on their facts and do not\ndemonstrate that the law was unsettled in 2002, much less after.”) (citations omitted).\n-17-\n\n“detention” facility in Plaintiffs’ rubric.  This very argument was rejected in Bame.  The D.C. Circuit\nfound the “Court’s rationale in Bell applies equally to any detention facility that is ‘fraught with\nserious security dangers,’ as was the cellblock at the Superior Court, where often hundreds of\narrestees were processed in a single day.”  Id. at *17 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 559).  “Contrary to\nthe plaintiffs’ contention, nothing whatsoever in Bell suggests its holding is limited to overnight\ndetention facilities. . . . [n]or . . . did the Court in Bell anywhere mention, let alone rely upon, such\nintermingling as a reason for upholding the strip searches.”  Id.  “In any event, arrestees held at the\nSuperior Court were in fact commingled with other arrestees in holding cells; no one suggests each\narrestee was put in a separate cell.”  Id. at *17–18.\nThe D.C. Circuit has spoken unequivocally.  Even assuming all facts alleged by the\nFourth Amendment class as true, the claims addressed in Bame and the instant case cannot be\ndistinguished in any meaningful way.  Obviously, the Court must reconsider and modify its prior\nruling that Marshal Dillard is not entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment\nclaims, see Order Denying Defs.’ Mots. to Dismiss [Dkt. # 81], in light of the D.C. Circuit’s\ndecision.  Marshal Dillard is entitled to qualified immunity against the claims that he violated\nPlaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, which\nspoke solely to the Fourth Amendment claims, will be denied, and summary judgment will be\nentered for Marshal Dillard.\n   B.  Fifth Amendment Claims\nThe Fifth Amendment Class consists of:\nEach woman who, during the Class Period (December 2,\n1999, until April 25, 2003), was, (I) held in the Superior\nCourt Cell Block; (ii) awaiting presentment under a statute\n-18-\n\nof the District of Columbia; (iii) subjected to a blanket strip,\nvisual body cavity and/or squat search; (iv) under similar\ncircumstances for which male arrestees were not subjected\nto a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search.\nSee Order Certifying Class at 1.  Plaintiffs argue that by no later than January 1999, “defendant\nDillard had a policy and practice in place of requiring all female prisoners but not male prisoners to\nbe subjected to blanket drop, squat, and cough searches.”  Pls.’ Reply [Dkt. # 251] at 10.  This\ngender-based practice is alleged to have violated Plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection.10  As noted\nabove, significant evidence exists that both the policy and practice at the Superior Court cellblock\nduring the class period was that every female arrestee was subjected to a blanket drop, squat and\ncough search.  See supra note 2. \nIn contrast, ample evidence exists that, at least in practice, many DEOs and deputies\ndid not subject male arrestees to a blanket drop, squat and cough search unless there were reasonable,\nindividualized suspicion that the male arrestee was harboring contraband or presented other risk. \nSee, e.g., Pls.’ Mem., [Attach. 57] Mark Shealey Dep. (May 8, 2007) at 157, 166–67 (testifying as\nto practice between January 1999 to summer of 2002 as the a.m. cellblock supervisor); id., [Attach.\n10 The Fifth Amendment provides that “[no] person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or\nproperty, without due process of law.”  U.S. CONST. amend.

The equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment does not apply to the District of Columbia, which is a political entity created\nby the federal government, but the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment has been held to\nimpose the same equal protection restrictions on the federal government and D.C. as the Fourteenth\nAmendment does on the States.

Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 234\n(1979).  “To withstand scrutiny under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due\nProcess Clause, ‘classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must\nbe substantially related to achievement of those objectives.’”  Davis, 442 U.S. at 234–35 (quoting\nCalifano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 316–317 (1977)).  “The equal protection component of the Due\nProcess Clause thus confers on petitioner a federal constitutional right to be free from gender\ndiscrimination which cannot meet these requirements.”  Id. at 235–36.\n-19-\n\n41] Edward Eversman Dep. (Sept. 14, 2009) at 52–54, 72, 77–79, 82 (testifying that between\nFebruary 1997 to June 2000, he never witnessed a blanket practice of strip searching male arrestees\nnor was he ever instructed by any superior to conduct such strip searches); id., [Attach. 30] Michael\nArtis Dep. (Aug. 16, 2007) at 97–102, 110–12 (explaining that during the class period male arrestees\nwere only strip searched upon individualized suspicion and that out of thousands of male arrestees\nhe had patted down, with the exception of a male juvenile, he could not recall one instance of strip\nsearching a male arrestee); id., [Attach. 33] Robert Brandt Dep. (Jan. 6, 2009) at 53–54, 56, 73\n(stating that from 1996 to 2004, he never saw a male arrestee strip searched without individualized\nsuspicion nor did any supervisor ever tell him to strip search all male arrestees as a blanket policy);\nid., [Attach. 40] Mark Anthony Edge Dep. (Oct. 20, 2008) at 44–46 (same practice from 1989 to\n2008); id., [Attach. 32] Ronald Erwin Bolls Dep. (Jan. 21, 2009) at 25–28, 30–31, 33–34, 37\n(testifying as p.m. cellblock supervisor from September 2000 to January 2002 that male arrestees\nwere not subject to a blanket practice of drop, squat and cough searches).\nJust to confuse things, the record also contains vague and contradictory testimony that\nthe standard under which a male arrestee might have been subjected to a drop, squat and cough\nsearch, i.e., blanket protocol or individualized suspicion, changed once or more during the class\nperiod.  See Pls.’ Mem., [Attach. 54] Gregory Petchel Dep. (Jan. 6, 2009) at 62–73 (testifying that,\nas supervisory deputy from 1996 to 2004, the initial practice was to strip search male arrestees only\nupon individualized suspicion; around 2001, the practice changed to strip searches of all male\narrestees; that practice was stopped again, resumed again, and finally ended when the Office of\nGeneral Counsel told the Marshal to cease around 2003); id., [Attach. 59] Jonathan Stover Dep. (Oct.\n21, 2008) at 53–62 (testifying that he was not instructed to subject male arrestees to a blanket\n-20-\n\npractice of drop, squat and cough searches until around 2000, but the practice did not last long before\nit stopped again);11 id., [Attach. 27] Clyde Afman Dep.

Even if some DEOs or deputies conducted strip searches on male arrestees on\noccasion, it cannot be said that the record supports Marshal Dillard’s testimony of a blanket practice\nat the Superior Court cellblock of drop, squat and cough strip searches of male arrestees.12\n11 Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Leave to Address Jonathan Stover’s Testimony Offered in\nDefendant’s Reply to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment, see [Dkt. # 262], which in essence\nis a motion for leave to file a surreply.  The Court allowed Defendant an opportunity to file a\nresponse to arguments raised in this motion.  See Def.’s Consolidated Response [Dkts. ## 269, 270]. \nThe motion [Dkt. # 262] will be granted.\n12 It would take a fact-finder to decipher the differences in testimony between Marshal\nDillard—who says that he merely continued a pre-existing search policy when he became U.S.\nMarshal for the Superior Court; that his policy was consistent throughout the class period; that the\nmanagers and supervisors in the chain of command were to enforce his policies; that he discussed\ninconsistencies and problems arising at the Superior Court with his supervisors at a weekly meeting;\nand that he personally visited the male search rooms unannounced and at random times to ensure\ncompliance with his policies and observed male arrestees subjected to drop, squat and cough\nsearches, see, e.g., Dillard Dep. at 50, 52–57, 72, 75–76, 90–92, 95–96, 98, 228; see also id. at 56\n(“My instructions were that every supervisor was to constantly be aware of what is going on in the\narea that they were responsible for supervising.  And the only way you could possibly do that is to\neyeball it yourself periodically.  I mean, you didn’t have to stand there all day, of course, we had\nother duties.  But you had to know – to know what was going on, you had to see what was going\non.”), and the sworn answers of the Service in Clifton and Helton, as well as the testimony of\nsupervisory deputies, deputies, and DEOs that male arrestees were not subjected to a blanket practice\nof strip searches.\n-21-\n\nMarshal Dillard counters that “the evidence that Plaintiffs cite indicates that the\nsearch practice may have varied among male and female deputies and DEOs,” Def.’s Reply [Dkt.\n# 250] at 25, but that his policy was clear and gender neutral.  See, e.g., Dillard Dep. 63–69, 92–93,\n96–98.  Marshal Dillard argues there is no evidence that he intentionally discriminated against\nPlaintiffs in violation of their constitutional rights and that he cannot be held liable under a theory\nof respondeat superior, even if any of his subordinates violated their rights.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n129 S. Ct. 1937, 1948 (2009); Simpkins v. District of Columbia Gov’t, 108 F.3d 366, 369 (D.C. Cir.\n1997).  As to this, he is clearly correct. \nAlthough there is abundant evidence that similarly situated male and female arrestees\nwere searched differently at the D.C. Superior Court cellblock during the class period, the inquiry\ndoes not end there.  “[A] plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the\nofficial’s own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.”  Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1948.  “Where\nthe claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our\ndecisions make clear that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with\ndiscriminatory purpose.”  Id. (citations omitted).\nUnder extant precedent purposeful discrimination requires\nmore than “intent as volition or intent as awareness of\nconsequences.”    Personnel  Administrator  of  Mass.  v.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979).  It instead involves a\ndecisionmaker’s undertaking a course of action “‘because\nof,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ [the action’s] adverse effects\nupon an identifiable group.”  Ibid.  It follows that, to state a\nclaim based on a violation of a clearly established right,\nrespondent must plead sufficient factual matter to show that\npetitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies\nat issue not for a neutral, investigative reason but for the\npurpose of discriminating on account of [sex].\n-22-\n\nId. at 1948–49.  Thus, the “complaint must at least allege that the defendant federal official was\npersonally involved in the illegal conduct.”  Simpkins, 108 F.3d at 369.13\nIt is on this point that Plaintiffs’ claims cannot succeed.  There is no allegation or\nevidence that Marshal Dillard personally conducted any of the challenged strip searches.  Further,\nnotwithstanding the plethora of evidence that male and female arrestees were searched according to\ndiffering  protocols,  Plaintiffs  fail  to  point  to  any  colorable  evidence  that  Marshal  Dillard\npurposefully intended this disparity to exist as a way to discriminate against women.  Plaintiffs argue\nthat a jury could infer from all the evidence that Marshal Dillard changed the policy during his tenure\nspecifically to require that all female arrestees undergo a strip search while male arrestees were only\nto be similarly searched upon individualized suspicion; or that even if the official policy were gender\nneutral, that Marshal Dillard directed—or, at a minimum, was aware of—the unequal search\npractices.  Neither argument is supported by the record and Marshal Dillard’s mere knowledge of\na disparity in search protocols, even if shown, would not suffice to impose personal liability. \n1. No Evidence That Marshal Dillard Intended a Discriminatory Policy\nNo evidence exists that Marshal Dillard implemented a policy which directed a\nblanket practice of strip searching female arrestees but subjected male arrestees to strip searches only\non individualized suspicion.  Plaintiffs allege that testimony about meetings between Marshal Dillard\nand his supervisors to discuss implementing a customized Superior Court search policy could\nreasonably create an impression with a jury that Marshal Dillard specifically instituted a gendered\n13 To the extent Plaintiffs attempted to proceed against Marshal Dillard on a theory of\ndeliberate indifference, see Second Am. ¶ 232, the theory must fail.  See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1948\n(“purposeful discrimination requires more than ‘intent as volition or intent as awareness of\nconsequences’”) (citation omitted).  It appears Plaintiffs have abandoned any deliberate indifference\ntheory of liability.  See Def.’s Reply at 42 n.16.\n-23-\n\npolicy; Plaintiffs also cite the Clifton and Helton interrogatory responses as support that such a\npolicy—and not merely an irregular practice—existed.  \nThe meetings in question are brought to light by Michael Mitchell, who worked at\nthe Superior Court from 1998 to 2003 in various capacities, but who admittedly was confused as to\nthe dates of these meetings.14  Mr. Mitchell mentioned a 1999 meeting with Marshal Dillard and\nChief Deputy Charles Rowe, second in command, sometime after issuance of Policy Directive 99-25\nby the Service in July 1999.  Mr. Mitchell remembers that Marshal Dillard said he wanted every\narrestee to be subject to a drop, squat and cough search until a “more customized” approach for the\nSuperior Court—being developed by Chief Rowe—could be implemented in the wake of Policy\nDirective 99-25.  Pls.’ Mem., [Attach. 51] Michael Mitchell Dep. (Oct. 7, 2009) at 119–22.  At a\nsecond meeting, after Mr. Mitchell had become an Assistant Deputy Chief in 2000, Mr. Mitchell\nremembered that Chief Rowe was about to “put the district policy out” that would prohibit strip\nsearches without individualized suspicion.  Id. at 123–24, 132–33.  Later in his deposition, Mr.\nMitchell acknowledged that he was unsure of the dates of the meetings and indicated that the first\nmeeting could have occurred as late as 2003.  Id. at 128–29, 156–57.\nPlaintiffs pounce on the lack of certainty of such dates, and the evidence that men and\nwomen arrestees were treated differently, to argue that a jury could find that Marshal Dillard\nimplemented a policy in 1999 or 2000 that prohibited blanket strip searches of male arrestees while\nrequiring it of all female arrestees.  However, at no point did Mr. Mitchell testify that the new\n14 Mr. Mitchell came to the Superior Court as the a.m. cellblock supervisor in January 1998,\ncontinued in that position until January 1999, was then promoted to Assistant Chief Deputy in 2000,\nand became a Chief Deputy in September 2003, when he left the Superior Court.  For his first year\nas cellblock supervisor, he testified that the practice was to strip search every male arrestee.  Pls.’\nMem., [Attach. 51] Michael Mitchell Dep. (Oct. 7, 2009) at 18, 83–86. \n-24-\n\nSuperior Court policy would call for male and female arrestees to be treated differently or that\nMarshal Dillard ordered, or ever mentioned, such a difference in treatment.  No matter how confused\nthe testimony about dates, there is no testimony that Marshal Dillard contemplated a policy of gender\ndiscrimination against women by search practices.15\nSimilarly, while the sworn answers to interrogatories in Clifton and Helton, signed\nby supervisory Deputy Mark Shealey, indicate a clear differentiation in treatment of male and female\narrestees, there is no evidence tying Marshal Dillard to this difference, much less that he ordered it. \nIn fact, Marshal Dillard testified that he neither read nor wrote the interrogatory responses.  Dillard\nDep. at 119, 144.  Further, Mr. Shealey, in the sworn answers, identified Policy Directive 99-25 as\nthe governing policy in 2000 and 2001, thus refuting Plaintiffs’ argument that some unaccounted for,\ndiscriminatory policy had been put in place.  While still agreeing with the factual premise of the\ninterrogatory responses that only female arrestees were subject to a blanket practice of drop, squat\nand cough searches, Mr. Shealey testified at deposition in this case that he did not know why the\npractice was to strip search female arrestees, but not male arrestees, and that he just assumed it was\nbecause females could hide contraband in their vaginas.  Shealey Dep. at 158–162.  Further, he\ntestified that no one had ever directed him to treat the genders differently.  Id. at 160, 163–68. \nNeither of these bits of evidence carries Plaintiffs’ burden to show that Marshal Dillard purposefully\ndiscriminated against women arrestees through a Superior Court policy.\n15 Plaintiffs express great skepticism that the search practices could be as disparate as the\ninterrogatory answers and discovery indicate without the intention and/or knowledge of Marshal\nDillard.  The Marshal’s testimony about his and his supervisors’ attention to cellblock issues\nsupports such skepticism, especially when contrasted with Marshal Dillard’s frequent memory lapses\nat deposition.  However, the beginning of the time period in question is more than a decade ago and\nMarshal Dillard has long since retired.  Given the legal standards applicable to Plaintiffs’ claims,\ntheir skepticism is insufficient to push this matter to a jury.\n-25-\n\n2. No Evidence Marshal Dillard Directed a Discriminatory Practice\nThere is no colorable evidence in the record that Marshal Dillard knew of the practice\nof searching the sexes differently, let alone that such a practice was directed by him.  Plaintiffs argue\nit is incredible to believe Marshal Dillard did not know of the disparate search practices given the\nprolific nature of these practices—which may have existed for years—and that Marshal Dillard had\nsupervisors who were supposed to be reporting to him on failures of Superior Court personnel to\nfollow his policies.  The argument fails to carry the point.  Marshal Dillard’s mere knowledge of, or\nacquiescence  in,  his  subordinates’  potentially  discriminatory  practices  would  not  constitute\npurposeful discrimination on his part.  See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (rejecting argument that\nsuperiors may be liable for their “knowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates’ use of\ndiscriminatory criteria to make classification decisions among detainees”). \nMarshal Dillard’s recollection was hazy but he testified to observing male arrestees\nbeing strip searched on those occasions that he inspected male search rooms.  Dillard Dep. at 76. \nPlaintiffs contend that Marshal Dillard must have observed and implicitly approved a different\nsearch policy for male arrestees than for women since he says he observed strip searches in the male\nsearch room but other deposition testimony indicates a lack of a blanket policy on strip searching\nmale arrestees.  According to Plaintiffs, this varying testimony “creates an inference that defendant\nDillard knew about the search practices and approved them.”  Pls.’ Opp’n [Dkt. # 243] at 15. \nHowever, both deputies and DEOs testified that they rarely, if ever, saw Marshal Dillard in the\ncellblock or had any contact with him, see, e.g., Def.’s Mem., [Attach. 6] Suppl. Interrogatory\nResponses, Answers to Question # 5; Shealey Dep. at 284 (testifying that he only recalled seeing\nMarshal Dillard in the cellblock on September 11, 2001); Stover Dep. at 61, 91 (“I can’t recall\n-26-\n\n[whether Marshal Dillard ever observed any strip searches].  Marshal [Dillard] hardly ever came to\nthe cell block”), and the Marshal’s testimony alone does not carry the inference Plaintiffs seek, even\nif an inference alone satisfied Plaintiffs’ burden. \nTo be sure, Marshal Dillard proclaimed that it was his job as a supervisor to ensure\nhis policies were being followed, that his supervisors should have known if there were any deviation\nfrom these policies, and that any such deviation would have been discussed at weekly supervisors’\nmeetings.  See Dillard Dep. at 68, 73.  Marshal Dillard insists that he would have “relieved [a\nsupervisory deputy] immediately, if not sooner,” id. at 197, if he had heard that he told a cellblock\nDEO or deputy not to subject male prisoners to a blanket drop, squat and cough search.  These\nprotestations notwithstanding, Plaintiffs have no evidence that Marshal Dillard actually knew that\nhis alleged search policy was not being evenly enforced, let alone any evidence that Marshal Dillard\nintended or directed such disparity as a way to purposefully discriminate against women arrestees.16\n16 The record suggests many reasons why practices may have varied, not least of which\nappears to have been a singular lack of direction or oversight by those in command.  See, e.g.,\nMitchell Dep. at 71–74, 87–88 (explaining that when he began at the Superior Court he was never\ninstructed by Marshal Dillard or Chief Rowe how searches were to be conducted, but simply copied\nthe practices of those around him); Bolls Dep. at 32, 39–42, 60, 62–63 (testifying that as cellblock\nsupervisor he never had any conversations or instructions, nor was aware of written policies, on how\nto search arrestees, nor was this topic broached at any supervisors’ meetings he attended); Pls.’\nMem., [Attach. 20] Thomas Hedgepeth Dep. (July 18, 2007) at 82 (expressing that Marshal Dillard\nwas a hands-off manager); Hedgepeth Dep. (7/17/07) at 225–27 (acknowledging that cellblock\npersonnel did not like strip searching male arrestees and avoided doing so); Stover Dep. at 58 (noting\nthat when supervisors were not around, he and other DEOs or deputies would often stop blanket strip\nsearches of male arrestees because of their dislike of the practice); id. at 99 (“It’s not something that,\nyou know, I wanted to do.  I didn’t think it made any sense, personally.”); Brandt Dep. at 69\n(explaining that neither he nor his fellow DEOs or deputies would conduct blanket strip searches of\nmale arrestees because “I expressed my opinion that it wasn’t an appropriate search and they did not\ndo the searches when I was there. . . I didn’t say, ‘Don’t you do it’ [to the other men].  I said, ‘I don’t\nthink it’s a good practice,’ and my recollection is people that were there with me agreed and\nperformed regular in-custody searches.”); Def.’s Dep. Excerpts II [Dkt. # 248], [Attach. 20] Carl\nEugene Teeter Dep. (July 23, 2008) at 87–88, 124 (noting that male arrestees not all strip searched\n-27-\n\nPlaintiffs argue that all the contested evidence makes it totally incredible that Marshal\nDillard did not at least know of the disparities in search practices, and that credibility is an issue for\na jury to decide.  See Jones v. Bernanke, 557 F.3d 670, 681 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  Marshal Dillard\ndefends on the basis that “no one has testified that Marshal Dillard instructed them to search males\nand females differently, and no one who admits [to strip searching women but not men] . . . claims\nto have even informed Marshal Dillard of that practice.”  Def.’s Reply [Dkt. # 250] at 16.  The\ndefense amounts to “ignorance is bliss,” which is usually insufficient to avoid a jury trial.  But when\nit comes to holding a federal employee, acting within the scope of his employment, personally liable\nfor a violation of the Fifth Amendment’s right to equal protection, a plaintiff must show purposeful\nand personal action to discriminate (in this case on gender).  As a result, it would not be dispositive\neven if Marshal Dillard knew of the discriminatory search practices (which is not shown).  Mere\nknowledge of or deliberate indifference to unequal treatment is not enough and despite the\nvoluminous record created in this litigation, there is no circumstantial or direct evidence that Marshal\nDillard purposefully directed that women and men be searched differently at the Superior Court\ncellblock. \nSummary judgment is properly granted against a party who “after adequate time for\ndiscovery and upon motion . . . fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an\nelement essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” \nCelotex, 477 U.S. at 322.  Marshal Dillard is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Fifth\nbecause of sheer numbers involved); Shealey Dep. at 166–67 (explaining that the ratio of men to\nwomen processed into the cellblock was approximately 4 to 1, so it was impractical to strip search\nevery male arrestee:  “If the numbers [of DEOs/deputies to arrestees] were equal, and the manpower\nand the time restraints were enough where we could strip everybody, we’d strip everybody”).\n-28-\n\nAmendment claims.\nIV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs Donna Curtis, Dianne Johnson, and Carolyn\nMontgomery will be dismissed without prejudice.  Summary judgment will be denied to Plaintiffs\non their Fourth Amendment claims and granted to Marshal Dillard on the Fourth and Fifth\nAmendment claims.  Marshal Dillard’s Motion for Order to Decertify Class, see [Dkt. # 258], will\nbe denied as moot.  Accordingly, this case will be dismissed.  A memorializing Order accompanies\nthis Memorandum Opinion.  \nDated: April 21, 2011                       /s/                            \nROSEMARY M. COLLYER\nUnited States District Judge\n-29-",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n)\nDIANA JOHNSON, et al., )\n)\nPlaintiffs, )\n)\nv. ) Civil Action No. 02-2364 (RMC)\n)\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al., )\n)\nDefendants. )\n)\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nThis lawsuit challenges actions by Todd Dillard, the former Marshal of the Superior\nCourt of the District of Columbia, the United States Marshal Service (“USMS”), and the District of\nColumbia.  Plaintiffs complain that from December 2, 1999 to April 25, 2003 (the “Class Period”),\nthe Superior Court Marshal subjected all female (but not male) arrestees1 to blanket drop, squat, and\ncough strip searches, without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, and that the District\nof Columbia knew or should have known about the illegal searches but nonetheless presented its\narrestees to the Superior Court Marshal.  On this factual predicate, Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for\nClass Certification [Dkt. # 138].  \nPlaintiffs propose certification of a “Fifth Amendment Class,” based on alleged\nviolations of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,\ncomposed of all female arrestees, regardless of charge, taken to the Superior Court for presentment\n1  “Arrestee,” as used herein, is a person who was arrested and brought to D.C. Superior Court for presentment\npursuant to Rule 5 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, but had not yet been presented to a judge or\nmagistrate at Superior Court.  See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Class Certification (“Pls.’ Mem.”) [Dkt. # 138] at\n1 n.1.\n1\n\nduring the Class Period,2 and a “Fourth Amendment Class,” composed of female arrestees, arrested\non charges not involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, who were taken to the Superior Court\nfor presentment during the Class Period.3\nPlaintiffs also seek to certify an “Alternative Fourth Amendment Class,” complaining\nthat the Superior Court Marshall subjected all arrestees, males as well as females, to the blanket\ndrop, squat, and cough strip searches, and that the District of Columbia knew or should have known\nabout the illegal searches, but handed its arrestees over to the Superior Court Marshal during the\nClass Period anyway. \nPlaintiffs argue that each class – the Fifth Amendment Class, the Fourth Amendment\nClass, and the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class – separately meets the requirements as a\n“hybrid” class.  See Eubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d 87, 96 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (courts may adopt a\n“hybrid” approach, certifying a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) class as to the claims for\n2  As set forth in the Second Amended Complaint [Dkt. # 84], the “Fifth Amendment Class” is defined as:  \nEach woman who, during the Class Period . . ., was (i) while in the Superior\nCourt Cell Block or just before being put in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii)\nbeing held for presentment subject to a statute of the District of Columbia; (iii)\nunder similar circumstances as men arrestees; (iv) subjected to a blanket strip,\nvisual body cavity and/or squat search.  \nSecond Am. Compl. ¶ 191.\n3  As set forth in the Second Amended Complaint, the “Fourth Amendment Class” is defined as: \nEach woman who during the . . . Class Period . . . was or will be, (i) while being\nheld or just before being put in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) for\npresentment under a statute of the District of Columbia; on either (iii)(a) a non\ndrug, non violent traffic offense; (iii)(b) a non drug, non violent misdemeanor; or\n(iii)(c) a non drug, non violent felony; (iv) was subjected to a blanket strip,\nvisual body cavity search and/or squat search without any individualized finding\nof reasonable suspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs,\nweapons or other contraband.\nSecond Am. Compl. ¶ 178.\n2\n\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief, and a 23(b)(3) class as to the claims for monetary relief, effectively\ngranting 23(b)(3) protections including the right to opt out to class members at the monetary relief\nstage).  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and monetary relief against the District of Columbia and former\nSuperior Court Marshal Dillard, and injunctive relief only against the USMS.  \nMarshal Dillard and the USMS (collectively, the “Federal Defendants”) and the\nDistrict of Columbia oppose the motion entirely, arguing, inter alia, that there is no live controversy\nand that the Plaintiffs lack standing to represent the interest of any future arrestees for purposes of\ninjunctive relief.  The District of Columbia further argues that Plaintiffs cannot meet the “adequacy\nof representation” requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(4).  For the reasons that\nfollow, the motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\nI.  BACKGROUND\nThis case has been pending for over five years.  The Plaintiffs and the United States\nfirst strove mightily, with yeoman help from the District of Columbia, to identify the female arrestees\nduring the Class Period and then to reach a settlement.  Only when those efforts failed unexpectedly\ndid it become necessary to complete discovery and prepare for trial.  \nPlaintiffs allege that almost 16,000 female arrestees were subjected to the drop, squat,\nand cough strip searches during the period from December 2, 1999, three years before the Complaint\nwas filed, to April 25, 2003, the date Federal Defendants allege they stopped the practice.  Pls.’\nMem. at 2, Ex. 24 (Kriegler Aff. ¶ 11).\nCourts routinely certify strip search class actions similar to this one.  See, e.g.,\nAugustin v. Jablonsky (In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases), 461 F.3d 219 (2d Cir. 2006);\nTardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004); Dodge County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177\n3\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2005); Blihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D. 607, 622-23 (W.D. Wis. 2003); Bynum\nv. District of Columbia, 217 F.R.D. 43 (D.D.C. 2003); Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69\n(S.D.N.Y. 2002).\nII. LEGAL STANDARDS\nThe “party requesting class certification under Rule 23 bears the burden of showing\nthe existence of a class, that all prerequisites of Rule 23(a) are satisfied and the class falls within one\nof the categories of Rule 23(b).”  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 214 F.R.D. 27, 30-31 (D.D.C.\n2003) (citations omitted).  \nUnder Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there are four requirements\nfor certification of a class:\n1. the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\n(“numerosity”);\n2. there are questions of law or fact  common to the class\n(“commonality”);\n3. the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the\nclaims or defenses of the class (“typicality”); and\n4. the  representative  parties  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the\ninterests of the class (“adequacy”).\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  Plaintiffs must also satisfy at least one of the subdivisions of Rule 23(b).  A\nplaintiff satisfies Rule 23(b)(2) by showing:\nthe party opposing the class had acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the\nclass as a whole.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  A plaintiff satisfies Rule 23(b)(3) by showing:\n(1) the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members;\nand (2) a class action is superior to other available methods for the\nfair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\n4\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  \nIn deciding a motion for class certification, the “inquiry does not extend to an\nexamination of the merits of the case.  Instead, the legal standard is whether the evidence presented\nby plaintiffs establishes a ‘reasonable basis for crediting [plaintiffs’] assertions.’”  Bynum, 214\nF.R.D. at 31 (citing cases); Chang v. United States, 717 F.R.D. 262, 269 (D.D.C. 2003) (“Once the\nexistence of a class has been established, the Court does not consider the merits of the plaintiffs’\nclaims prior to proceeding to a determination of whether the requirements for class certification set\nforth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b) have been met.”).  The determination of whether to certify a\nmatter as a class action must be done “at an early practicable time” in the case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(c)(1)(A).  \nIII. ANALYSIS\nThe Federal Defendants resist class certification.  Only two of their arguments are\nserious:  First, they contend that there is no live controversy, because Marshal Dillard has retired and\nthe USMS has ceased the practice (i.e., the case is moot); and second, the Federal Defendants\ncontend that the named Plaintiffs do not have standing to represent the interests of future arrestees\nto support the request for injunctive relief.  \nThe District of Columbia argues that the request for Rule 23(b)(2) certification (for\ninjunctive relief) should be denied as moot because the Federal Defendants have changed their\nsearch policy.  It also argues that there is a lack of predominance of common issues pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) in that there is no evidence concerning the injuries any\nrepresentative Plaintiff or other class member may have suffered.  See District of Columbia’s Mem.\nin Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Class Certification (“D.C. Defs.’ Mem.”) at 5 (“[i]t is this very lack of\n5\n\ninformation that makes it impossible at this stage for the court to determine whether common issues\npredominate. . . .” (emphasis in original)).  Finally, the District of Columbia argues that the Court\ncannot certify the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class because there is no factual basis to support\nthe theory that males as well as females were subjected to the same blanket search policies.  Id. at\n6.   \nThe Court agrees that there is a lack of factual support concerning the existence of\nthe Alternative Fourth Amendment Class.   Therefore, the Court will deny the request for\ncertification of the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class without prejudice.  See Wagner v. Taylor,\n836 F.2d 578, 587 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“some inspection of the circumstances of the case is essential\nto determine whether the prerequisites of . . . Rule 23 have been met.  Necessarily, the Court must\nexamine both the claims presented and the showing in support of class certification for their\nadherence to the requirements of Rule 23.”).  If, during discovery, evidence is produced that supports\nthe existence of this class, the Court may revisit the issue.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C) (“An\norder [on class certification] may be altered or amended before final judgment.”).\nThe Court will examine each requirement for class certification for the Fourth and\nFifth Amendment Classes in turn.\nA. Existence of a Class\n“It is axiomatic that for a class action to be certified a ‘class’ must exist.”  Barnes v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. 113, 120 (D.D.C. 2007) (citing Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d 655, 699\n(7th Cir. 1981)); see also Lewis v. Nat’l Football League, 146 F.R.D. 5, 8 (D.D.C. 1992) (clearly\ndefined class is necessary “to ensure that the class is ‘neither amorphous, nor imprecise’”) (internal\ncitation omitted).  It is clear that Plaintiffs have fulfilled their obligation in defining the classes such\n6\n\nthat it is “administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual is a\nmember.”  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 31 (citations omitted).  The Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs’\nproposed class definitions for the Fourth Amendment Class and the Fifth Amendment Class, see\nsupra n.2 & n.3, are tailored properly so that “an individual would be able to determine, simply by\nreading the definition, whether he or she is a member of the proposed class.”  Id. at 32.4\nB. Requirements of Rule 23(a)\nAll class actions certified under Rule 23 must meet certain prerequisites listed in\nsubsection (a): there must be numerosity of class members, common questions of law or fact, the\nrepresentative(s) must be typical of the class, and his or her representation of the class must be\nadequate.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n1. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) provides that a class action may be maintained only if “the class is so\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.”  The “numerosity requirement requires\nexamination of the specific facts of each case and imposes no absolute limitations.”  See Bynum, 214\nF.R.D. at 32 (citations omitted).  Generally, “courts have found that a proposed class consisting of\nat least forty members will satisfy the impracticability requirement.”  Id. \nThere is no question that the proposed Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment\nclasses here are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Defendants do not dispute\nPlaintiffs’ assertion, using data drawn from the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department database\nsystem (“MPD Data”) and from the D.C. Superior Court database system (“CIS Data”), that there\ncould be as many as 16,000 members in the Fifth Amendment Class and over 6,000 members in the\n4\n In the accompanying Order, the Court has made slight modifications to the class definitions in order to reflect the\nCourt’s decisions in the instant Memorandum Opinion.\n7\n\nFourth Amendment Class.  See Pls.’ Mem., Ex. 24 (Kriegler Aff. ¶ 11).  Furthermore, Plaintiffs have\nsubmitted affidavits from numerous individuals who claim to have been subjected to the strip search\npolicy at issue.  The Court, at this stage, does not need exact numbers, and understands that the\nparties are in the process of identifying potential class members.  See Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 32\n(citing Kilafi v. Hilton Hotels Retirement Plan, 189 F.R.D. 174, 176 (D.D.C. 1999) (“So long as\nthere is a reasonable basis for the estimate provided, the numerosity requirement can be satisfied\nwithout precise numbers.”)).   The Court therefore concludes that the classes proposed by Plaintiffs\nsatisfy the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1).\n2. Commonality and Typicality\nThe commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) states that there must be “questions\nof law or fact common to the class.”  However, it is not necessary that every issue of law or fact be\nthe same for each class member.  Rather, if “there is some aspect or feature of the claims which is\ncommon to all,” the requirement is satisfied.  Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at 121 (citing Pendleton v.\nSchlesinger, 73 F.R.D. 506, 508 (D.D.C. 1977) (emphasis added)); Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 32 (factual\nvariations among class members does not defeat the commonality requirement so long as a single\naspect or feature of the claim of the claim is common to all proposed class members).\nThe typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3) is satisfied “if the claims of the named\nplaintiffs arise from the same practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of the\nproposed class members.”  Marisol A. by Forbes v. Giuliani, 929 F. Supp. 662, 691 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).\nBecause “[t]he crux of both commonality and typicality requirements is to ensure that  the\nmaintenance of a class action is economical, and that the named Plaintiffs’ claims and the class\n8\n\nclaims are so inter-related that the interest of the class members will be fairly and adequately\nprotected in their absence,” it is proper to discuss them together.  Dodge, 226 F.R.D. at 180.  \nPlaintiffs have successfully established that there is sufficient commonality and\ntypicality for both classes.  First, “a strip-search, by its very nature, constitutes an extreme intrusion\nupon personal privacy, as well as an offense to the dignity of the individual,”  Wood v. Clemons, 89\nF.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir. 1996), and this intrusion is alleged to have been commonly experienced by\nall members of both classes.  Further, Plaintiffs have laid out several issues of law and fact that are\ncommon to all members of the two respective classes, including, obviously, whether the alleged\npolicy violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  See Pls.’ Mem. at 21-23, 39.\nRegarding typicality, Rule 23 does not require that the representative plaintiffs\nendured precisely the same injuries that may have been sustained by other class members, only that\nthe harm complained of be common to the class, and that the named plaintiffs demonstrate a personal\ninterest or threat of injury that is real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical.  Bynum, 214\nF.R.D. at 34.  The typicality requirement is satisfied “if the claims of the named plaintiffs arise from\nthe same practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of the proposed class members.”\nMarisol, 929 F. Supp. at 691.  Here, Plaintiffs allege that the same course of conduct caused injury\nto the Plaintiffs in both classes, and that the causation claims are common to all.  The claims of the\nnamed Plaintiffs are founded upon the same legal theory as those of class members – that Defendants\nviolated the Forth and Fifth Amendments when they subjected Plaintiffs and all class members to\nblanket drop, squat, and cough strip searches prior to presentment.  Although the circumstances of\nthe strip searches may have varied by some degree, demonstrating typicality “does not mean showing\nthat there are no factual variations between the claims of the plaintiffs.”  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 35.\n9\n\nAccordingly,  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the  commonality  and  typicality\nrequirements of Rule 23(a).\n   3. Adequacy of Representation \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(4) requires that certified classes have adequate\nrepresentation.  This requirement involves both adequacy of the named plaintiffs and adequacy of\ncounsel.  The requirement is met when: (1) there is no conflict of interest between the legal interests\nof the named plaintiffs and those of the proposed class; and (2) counsel for the class is competent\nto represent the class.  Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, 117 F.3d 571, 575 (D.C. Cir.\n1997).\nThe Court sees no conflicts of interest between the representative Plaintiffs and the\nproposed Fourth and Fifth Amendment Classes.  The issues presented by the named representatives\nmirror those faced by the putative class members.  Also, the Court sees no conflict in these Plaintiffs\nultimately representing the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class if, as the Federal Defendants have\nhinted, see Federal Defs.’ Mem. in Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Class Certification (“Fed. Defs.’ Mem.”)\nat 3, but the existing record contradicts, males were subjected to the same blanket drop, squat, and\ncough procedure.  However, any alleged conflict can be resolved at a later date if, in fact, the Court\nrevisits the issue of certification of the Alternative Fourth Amendment Class.  \nPlaintiffs’  counsel,  experienced  civil  rights  class  action  litigators  who  have\nparticipated in multiple class actions, are capable of representing the interests of the class in a\nsatisfactory manner and Defendants do not argue otherwise.  The Court is satisfied that the Plaintiffs\nhave fulfilled the requirements of Rule 23(a)(4).  \n10\n\nC. Rule 23(b) Requirements\nAfter the requirements under Rule 23(a) are met, a putative class must demonstrate\nthat it fits under one of Rule 23(b)’s class types.  Plaintiffs seek to certify the Fourth and Fifth\nAmendment Classes as “hybrid classes” under both Rules 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).  For the reasons that\nfollow, the Court will deny this request for “hybrid class” certification and will certify both classes\nunder Rule 23(b)(3) only.\n1. Rule 23(b)(2) Requirements\ni. Appropriateness of Equitable Relief\nTo certify a Rule 23(b)(2) class for injunctive or declaratory relief, Plaintiffs must\ndemonstrate that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally\napplicable  to  the  class,  thereby  making  appropriate  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding\ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2);   Barnes, 242\nF.R.D. at 122-23.  Both the Federal Defendants and the District of Columbia argue against the\ncertification of Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive relief classes, contending that the case is moot because the\npractice has stopped.  Federal Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to represent the\ninterests of future arrestees to bring a claim for injunctive relief.  For the reasons stated below,5 the\nCourt concludes that the claim for injunctive relief is not moot.  However, because Plaintiffs lack\nstanding, the Court will not certify Rule 23(b)(2) classes for injunctive relief.     \n5\n Although the Court does not assess the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims now, it is appropriate at the class certification\nstage to discuss justiciability concerns.  See, e.g., In re Lorezapam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litigation, 202 F.R.D.\n12, 22 (D.D.C. 2001); Prado-Steinman v. Bush, 221 F.3d 1266, 1280 (11th Cir. 2000) (“[A]ny analysis of class\ncertification must begin with the issue of standing.”); Cruz v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 356 F.3d 320, 331 (D.C. Cir. 2004)\n(plaintiffs’ lack of standing disposed of plaintiffs’ class certification arguments).  \n11\n\nii. Mootness\nThere is no dispute over the facts that Marshal Dillard has retired and that the USMS\nstopped performing these blanket searches in 2003, after this lawsuit was filed.  Superior Court\nMarshal Stephen Conboy attests that he has no plans to reinstate the policy.  See Fed. Defs.’ Mem.,\nDeclaration of Stephen T. Conboy (“Conboy Decl.”) ¶¶ 2-5.  However, these facts alone do not moot\nPlaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment Claim for injunctive relief.\nIn order to assert claims on behalf of a class, a named plaintiff must have personally\nsustained, or be in immediate danger of sustaining, “some direct injury as a result of the challenged\nstatute or official conduct.”  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 860 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations\nomitted).  The harm must constitute “actual injury.”  Id.  To obtain prospective injunctive relief, a\nplaintiff must demonstrate “that [she] is realistically threatened by repetition of [the violation].”  City\nof Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983).  Even where a suit presented a live controversy\nwhen filed, the mootness doctrine requires a federal court to refrain from deciding it if events have\nso transpired that the decision will not affect the parties’ rights presently and will not have a “more-\nthan-speculative” chance of affecting them in the future.  Clarke v. United States, 915 F.2d 699, 701\n(D.C. Cir. 1990).\nA case is moot if a defendant can demonstrate that two conditions have been met: (1)\ninterim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged\nviolation; and (2) there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged wrong will be repeated.  Doe\nv. Harris, 696 F.2d 109, 111 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (citing City of Los Angeles, 440 U.S. at 631).\nHowever, “[i]t is well settled that a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not\ndeprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.  If it did, the courts\n12\n\nwould be compelled to leave the defendant free to return to his old ways.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc.\nv. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (citations omitted; internal quotation marks\nand ellipses omitted).  “The case may nevertheless be moot if the defendant can demonstrate that\n‘there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.’”  United States v. W.T. Grant\nCo., 345 U.S. 630, 632 (1953) (citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs argue that their case is not moot because the Defendants continue to assert\nthat the challenged practices were fully constitutional, thus leaving Defendants free to resume the\nobjectionable searches after dismissal.  See Pls.’ Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Class Certification\n(“Pls.’ Reply”) at 7.  Plaintiffs also point out that some of the named Plaintiffs, and certainly many\nof the putative class, are recidivists who can expect to be presented at Superior Court in the future\nwhere a resumed search practice would once against violate their constitutional rights.  Id. at 6.\nFinally, Plaintiffs note that “[t]he affidavit from Stephen Conboy says he has no plans to reinstitute\nthe policy, but does not state categorically that he will not.”  Id. at 2.  Marshal Conboy, serving as\nActing Superior Court Marshal and Superior Court Marshal since February 2004, attests:\nSeveral  years  ago,  [the  District  of  Columbia  Superior  Court\n(“DCSC”)] instituted a new policy of body searches that discontinued\nthe practice of conducting “strip searches” of arrestees placed in\nDCSC  custody  in  the  DCSC  cellblock  in  the  absence  of  an\nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion, if not probable cause.\nThe current DCSC policy and practice (I) [sic] permits a strip search\nonly upon an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, if not\nprobable cause; and (ii) insures that such searches will be applied\neven-handedly to both men and women arrestees and detainees.  This\npolicy  has  been  enforced  and  uniformly  applied  by  all  DCSC\ncellblock personnel since I assumed the position of Acting United\nStates Marshal.\nBased on the current DCSC policy and practice, it is unlikely that\narrestees in the custody of DCSC personnel in the DCSC cellblock\n13\n\nwill  be  subjected  to  strip  searches  which  are  not  justified  by\nreasonable suspicion in the future.\nI have no plan or desire, [sic] to modify the current policy or practice\nthat limits strip searches as described in this declaration.\nFed. Defs.’ Mem., Declaration of Stephen T. Conboy (“Conboy Decl.”) ¶¶ 2-5.  \nThe Court finds that Marshal Conboy’s statement has insufficient finality for either\nthe Plaintiffs or the Court to be certain that the Superior Court Marshal will not revert to the prior\nsearch policies.  The Marshal cannot be left “free to return to his old ways.”  Friends of the Earth,\nInc., 528 U.S. at 632; see also City of Los Angeles, 440 U.S. at 631 (“[T]he case is not moot, since\nthe moratorium by its terms is not permanent.  Intervening events have not ‘irrevocably eradicated\nthe effects of the alleged violation.’”) (citation omitted).  The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims for\ninjunctive relief are not moot.  However, despite not being moot, Plaintiffs lack standing to bring\nsuch claims for injunctive relief for the reasons stated below.    \niii. Standing\nIn a suit to obtain prospective injunctive relief, a plaintiff must show a real and\nimmediate threat of future injury to establish a viable case or controversy.  City of Los Angeles, 461\nU.S. at 103-04; Aulenback, Inc. v. Fed. Highway Admin., 103 F.3d 156, 166-67 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\nIn order to meet the constitutional minimum of standing to seek injunctive relief, Plaintiffs must\nestablish that they have “sustained” or are “immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury\nas the result of the challenged official conduct.”  City of Los Angeles, 461 U.S. at 101-02 (1983)\n(citations omitted).  In doing so, Plaintiffs cannot simply rely on past injury to show standing.\nInstead, Plaintiffs must show a likelihood that they will be injured in the future.  See O’Shea v.\nLittleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974) (holding that “past exposure to illegal conduct does not in\n14\n\nitself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any\ncontinuing, present adverse effects”).  Abstract injury is insufficient to establish standing.  The\n“injury or threat of injury must be both ‘real and immediate,’ not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’”\nCity of Los Angeles, 461 U.S. at 194.  The likelihood that Plaintiffs may be arrested again is\ninsufficient to overcome this requirement: “the threat to the plaintiffs [is] not sufficiently real and\nimmediate to show an existing controversy simply because they anticipate violating criminal\nstatutes” in the future.  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nEntitlement to injunctive relief is a question of equity and requires “the likelihood of\nsubstantial and immediate irreparable injury, and the inadequacy of remedies at law.”  City of Los\nAngeles, 461 U.S. at 104 (citations omitted).  These standards have not been met here.  A court\nassumes that a plaintiff will obey the law and avoid prosecution.  Id.  Furthermore, under Superior\nCourt Marshal Conboy, the old practices have been scrapped.  While they could be renewed, there\nis nothing in the record to demonstrate the kinds of “immediacy and reality” to this possibility that\nis required for equitable relief.  Id.; see also Smook v. Minnehaha County, 457 F.3d 806, 816 (8th\nCir. 2006) (“Absent a sufficient allegation that [plaintiffs] are likely to be strip searched . . . in the\nfuture, they are no more entitled to an injunction than any other citizen.”).\nFinding that the Plaintiffs lack standing to obtain prospective injunctive relief, the\nCourt declines to certify Rule 23(b)(2) classes, and will dismiss the USMS from this lawsuit.   \n2. Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements\nDespite the fact that Plaintiffs lack standing to seek equitable relief, they do not have\nto wait another day to litigate their right to damages.  The Court will certify the Fourth and Fifth\nAmendment Classes under Rule 23(b)(3) because: (1) class-wide issues predominate and (2) a class\n15\n\naction  is  “superior  to  other  available  methods  to  the  fair  and  efficient  adjudication  of  the\ncontroversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); see Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 39.  \ni. Predominance of Common Questions at Law\n“In order to meet the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3), a plaintiff must\nestablish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof, thus applicable to\nthe class as a whole, . . . predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized proof.”\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997).  The predominance requirement is\n“more stringent” and “far more demanding” than the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a).  Id.\nat 609, 623.  \nFederal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed the predominance test because\nindividualized determinations will be necessary on the issue of liability.  See Fed. Defs.’ Mem. at\n2 (“[W]hat is clear in this action is that the predominant issues will focus on whether each specific\nprisoner was searched without a sufficient basis under the Constitution.  The factual inquiry for each\nwill entail detailed and individualized assessments of all facts and circumstances known about the\nPlaintiffs and those with whom they had contact as they entered the criminal justice system.  These\nextremely prisoner-specific inquiries predominate in the case and preclude class-action treatment.”).\nAlthough Federal Defendants argue that the question of “whether Marshal Dillard and the USMS\nviolated  any  potential  claimants’  constitutional  rights  .  .  .  should  turn  on  individualized\ndeterminations of whether USMS personnel had a legitimate basis to conduct such a search as to\neach arrestee,” the Court disagrees.  Plaintiffs are challenging whether Defendant Dillard, during the\nClass Period, had a policy or practice of subjecting female arrestees, regardless of charge, to the\nblanket drop, squat, and cough searches, and whether these searches violated the Constitution.  These\n16\n\nissues are subject to generalized proof.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 39.  Moreover, the Federal\nDefendants’ assertion that the Marshals made “individualized determinations . . . as to each\narrestee,” which will require “extremely prisoner-specific inquiries” is unsupported by any allegation\nin the Second Amended Complaint or the record as it has developed.  See Fed Defs.’ Mem. at 3. \nThe District of Columbia also argues that Plaintiffs have failed the predominance test,\nalleging that Plaintiffs have not produced sufficient evidence that common issues predominate on\ndamages.  See D.C. Defs.’ Mem. at 3 (“Up to this point, the plaintiffs have not presented sufficient\nevidence for the court to determine whether common issues predominate pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3).\n. . . [N]one of the named plaintiffs [has] given testimony regarding their experience in the Superior\nCourt cellblock or about any ‘injury they may have suffered as a result of the search . . . .’”).  The\nCourt disagrees that determination of damages in this case would require individualization such that\nPlaintiffs cannot establish predominance.  First, it may be the case that the “determination of\ndamages in this case [does not] require individualization.”  See Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167, 189\n(D.C. Cir. 1977).  Moreover, the mere existence of  individual damages issues in a Rule 23(b)(3)\nclass does not cause individual issues to predominate over common issues on liability or causation.\nSee Eubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d 87, 96 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  There are many ways of dealing with\npossible individual damages issues, if necessary, such as “(1) bifurcating liability and damage trials\nwith the same or different juries; (2) appointing a magistrate judge or special master to preside over\nindividual damages proceedings; (3) decertifying the class after the liability trial and providing notice\nto class members concerning how they may proceed to prove damages; (4) creating subclasses; or\n(5) altering or amending the class.”  See Carnegie v. Household Int’l, Inc., 376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th\nCir. 2004).  Plaintiffs have proposed using a damages matrix in which a jury could set a schedule\n17\n\nof damages for class members.  See Pls.’ Mem., Ex. 14 (Pls.’ Proposed Trial Plan) (citing Dellums,\n566 F.2d at 208), or trying damages on a class-wide basis using statistical sampling.  The Court\nreserves ruling on such methodology issues for another day but is satisfied that Plaintiffs have\nsatisfied the predominance requirement for the purposes of class certification.\nii. Whether Class Action is Superior \nThe  second  prong  of  Rule  23(b)(3)  is  superiority.    Under  this  requirement,\n“maintaining the present action as a class action must be deemed by the court to be superior to other\navailable methods of adjudication.  A case will often meet this standard when ‘common questions\nof law or fact permit the court to consolidate otherwise identical actions into a single efficient unit.’”\nBynum, 217 F.R.D. at 49 (citations omitted).  \nThe Court has already concluded that the size of the putative class makes joinder of\nindividual parties impracticable and that there are issues of law and fact common to the potential\nclass members.  It is also likely that the economic stake of each putative Plaintiff would be too small\nto suggest that individual suits should be brought.  See Bynum, 217 F.R.D. at 49.  Under these\ncircumstances, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of showing that class\ntreatment is superior.  See Wells v. Allstate Ins. Co., 210 F.R.D. 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2002) (“Rule 23(b)(3)\nfavors class actions where common questions of law or fact permit the court to ‘consolidate\notherwise identical actions into a single efficient unit.’”).   \nD. Notice to Potential Class Members\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2) provides that, in any class action maintained\nunder Rule 23(b)(3), notice shall be given to the class in the best practicable manner.  As required\nby the Rule, the notice shall advise each potential class member that she can choose to opt out of the\n18\n\nclass; that the judgment, whether favorable or not, will bind members who choose not to opt out; and\nthat individual class members who do not request inclusion may, if they so desire, enter an\nappearance through counsel.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2).  Within 30 days of this Memorandum\nOpinion, the parties shall file a joint proposal regarding class notification procedures.  If the parties\nare unable to reach agreement on the terms of the proposed order, the parties shall file separate\norders.  The Court notes that Plaintiffs have submitted a Proposed Trial Plan, see Pls.’ Mem., Ex.\n14 [Dkt. # 139], detailing proposals for, inter alia, possible bifurcation of a trial into liability and\ndamages phases and methodologies for potential damage calculations.  The Court reserves ruling on\nthose proposals.  However, if the parties believe that these issues must be resolved before the process\nfor notification may commence, that should be detailed in the forthcoming joint or separate\nproposals.          \nE. Appointment of Class Counsel\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g)(1)(C)(i) requires the Court to appoint adequate\nclass counsel to represent the class after considering: “(1) the work counsel has done in identifying\nor investigating potential claims in this action, (2) counsel’s experience in handling class actions,\nother complex litigation, and claims of the type asserted in the action, (3) counsel’s knowledge of\nthe applicable law, and (4) the resources counsel will commit to representing the class.”  See Bynum\nv. District of Columbia, 384 F. Supp. 2d 342, 366 (D.D.C. 2005).  The court may consider any “other\nmatter pertinent to counsel’s ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.”  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(C)(ii).  \n19\n\nAs discussed above, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs’ counsel are experienced\nclass action litigators who are competent to represent Plaintiffs.  As such, they will be appointed\nclass counsel for the Fourth and Fifth Amendment Classes.    \nIV. CONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief must be dismissed for lack of\nstanding.  Because Plaintiffs sought only such equitable relief from the USMS, the USMS will be\ndismissed from this case.  The Court will certify Rule 23(b)(3) classes for both the Fourth\nAmendment and Fifth Amendment Classes.  The Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs’ proposed class\ndefinitions for these two classes, with some modification, are adequate pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil  Procedure  23(c)(1)(B).    Plaintiffs’  motion  for  certification  of  an  Alternative  Fourth\nAmendment Class of men and women will be denied without prejudice for lack of any factual basis\nbeyond the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint.  Plaintiffs’ counsels William Claiborne\nand Barrett Litt will be appointed class counsel.  A memorializing order accompanies this\nMemorandum Opinion.\nDated:  February 8, 2008                    /s/                                  \nROSEMARY M. COLLYER\nUnited States District Judge\n20",

The court has \ndetermined that additional briefing of the motion for summary affirmance will not aid its \ndisposition.  It is \nFURTHER ORDERED that the motion for summary affirmance be denied.  The \nmerits of the parties' positions are not so clear as to warrant summary action.  See \nTaxpayers Watchdog, Inc. v. Stanley, 819 F.2d 294, 297 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (per curiam). \nBecause the court has determined that summary disposition is not in order, the \nClerk is instructed to enter a briefing schedule and to calendar this case for \npresentation to a merits panel. \nPer Curiam \nPage 2 ",
