    "summary": "<p>On May 12, 2005, male arrestees at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs sued the warden of Central Booking, the Baltimore Police Department, the City of Baltimore, and other state officials under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the Court for injunctive relief, compensatory and consequential damages, and attorneys fees and costs. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they engaged in unconstitutional strip searches of the plaintiffs and detained the plaintiffs for unreasonable lengths of time. This case was one of three cases alleging mistreatment of persons arrested and taken to Central Booking for booking and processing. The other cases were <a href=\"../../../../case/9620/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maryland NAACP v. Baltimore City Police Department</a>, 1:06-cv-01863-CCB (D. Md. 2006) and <a href=\"../../../../case/9810/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rodney v. Murphy</a>, 24-C-05004405, filed in Maryland state court.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sought certification for five classes. First, the suspicionless strip search class which consisted of those who had been or would be arrested for crimes not involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, who were strip searched by Central Booking employees without any individualized finding that they were harboring weapons, drugs, or other contraband. Second, the non-private strip search class was composed of those who had been or would be subjected to strip searches at Central Booking with other arrestees present. Third, the equal protection strip search class consisted of male arrestees strip searched at Central Booking while similarly-situated female arrestees were not. Fourth, the underwear strip search class was made up of male arrestees subjected to an underwear strip search while similarly-situated female arrestees were not. Fifth, the over-detention class consisted of those arrested without warrants who had been or would be detained for an unreasonable length of time (more than 48 hours) before presentment to a judicial officer for a determination of probable cause.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim. The District Court (District Judge Catherine C. Blake) granted the motion in part and dismissed all claims against the City and the Police Department, rejecting the theory of \"entrustment liability.\" Claims against the state defendants survived, with the exception of individual claims against the current warden. 470 F.Supp.2d 537 (D. Md. Jan 04, 2007).</p>\r\n<p>On July 11, 2008, the district court (Judge Blake) issued a memorandum on the issue of whether the gender-differentiated search policy violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the issue and denied the defendants' motion.</p>\r\n<p>On March 19, 2009, the district court partially granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. Specifically, the court certified the following subclasses: 1) those people detained for more than 48 hours without having been brought before a commissioner, and 2) those people arrested for minor, nondrug, nonviolent offenses and strip-searched before they were brought before a commissioner. The court declined to certify the following subclasses: 1) those people who weren't strip-searched privately, and 2) male arrestees who were searched to their underwear when female detainees were not.</p>\r\n<p>For the next two years, discovery motions were exchanged, until the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 14, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>On March 5th, 2013 Judge Blake issued a memorandum and an order granting the motion for partial summary judgment. The court granted the motion under the doctrine of qualified immunity.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an appeal on August of 2013. A panel of three judges rendered a decision on November 11, 2014. 771 F.3d 209 (4th Cir. 2014). The Circuit Court (Circuit Judge James Harvie Wilkinson III) affirmed the district court's decision to grant partial summary judgment for the defendants. The court noted that several police officers and guards testified that they found illegal contraband from these searches. And the searchers were being conducted in a private room. On the issue of qualified immunity, the court noted that the right to not be subjected to a strip search was not clearly established at the time of the searches. A Supreme Court decision was filed in 2012, settling aspects of the issue after the fact, but before this, officers who were conducting searches, could not reasonably tell if the searches were violating a constitutional right. The court found the defense of qualified immunity acceptable here, and determined that the motion for partial summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\r\n<p>Circuit Judge James Andrew Wynn Jr. filed a concurring opinion in which he pointed out that the Supreme Court intimated in the <em>Florence</em> decision that there may be exceptions to the rule. That detainees not being admitted into the general population should not have to be stripped searched. The complexities of the exceptions had not been explored by the courts, and Judge Wynn noted that there needed to be more elaboration on this topic, so public officials would know how to act accordingly. However, the merits of the case were not be reached because of the granting of summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On February 24, 2015 Judge Blake filed a memo regarding the January 31, 2011 motion for partial summary judgment. 2015 WL 790334. The motion was made by the warden-defendant, over the class of Plaintiffs claiming that Central Booking practiced \"over-detention.\" The court held that the plaintiffs' theory of supervisor liability was defective because there was no evidence that the warden-defendant was deliberately indifferent to the constitutional injury of the Plaintiffs. The warden-defendant did not deny that there were detainees held longer than 48 hours, which was past what was constitutionally acceptable, but she argued that it was caused by factors outside of her control. The court agreed that the delays in presenting detainees before a court commissioner was the fault of the Baltimore police, the state's attorneys office, and court officials. Furthermore, the court argued that the warden had made several efforts to remedy the problem, and that the plaintiffs' complaint that it was not fast enough or proactive enough did not prove deliberate indifference. Finally, the court also granted the summary judgment motion on the theory of qualified immunity, so the defendant had no fair warning that her conduct was unconstitutional.</p>\r\n<p>A few months later on June 15, 2015 the Court entered final judgment and closed the case.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiffs Eric Jones, Dana West, and Gary Saunders bring this class \naction lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all other arrestees who (1) were \nsubjected to strip searches while being held in the Baltimore Central Booking \nand Intake Center (“Central Booking”), waiting for presentment before a \ncommissioner or other judicial officer on (a) misdemeanors not involving a \nweapon or drugs, or (b) non-violent, non-drug related felony charge(s); or (2) \nwere subjected to strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches not \nconducted in private; or (3) were males subjected to blanket strip, visual body \n  2\n\ncavity and/or squat searches while being held in Central Booking, waiting for \npresentment before a judge or other judicial officer of the City of Baltimore \nregardless of the charges against them because similarly situated women were \nnot subjected to such searches.   \n2.  Plaintiffs Tonia Bowie, David Colyns, and Gary Saunders also bring this \nclass action on behalf of themselves and all other persons who were arrested in \nthe City of Baltimore but were not brought before a commissioner or other \njudicial officer for a probable cause hearing within 48 hours of their arrests.  \n3.  Plaintiff Eric Jones brings an individual claim for his detention after his \narrest without being brought before a commissioner or other judicial officer for \na probable cause hearing within a reasonable time period.  \nClasses \n4.  Plaintiffs move the Court to declare four separate classes, as described \nbelow. As used herein, “presentment” refers to the initial proceeding before the \nCourt referred to in Maryland Rule 4-212(f).  The time period for all classes is \nfrom May 12, 2002 through final judgment in this case. \n5.  Plaintiffs Dana West, Eric Jones, and Gary Saunders and the class of \npersons they seek to represent (the “Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class”) \nare arrestees arrested on (a) misdemeanors not involving a weapon or drugs, or \n(b) non-violent, non-drug related felony charge(s) who were subjected to strip \nsearches without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that they \n  3\n\nwere concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband, by employees of Central \nBooking, while they were held in Central Booking waiting for presentment \nbefore a commissioner or other judicial officer.  \n6.  The “Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class Members” are not (prior \nto presentment) commingled with persons who have been ordered detained at \nCentral Booking or the Baltimore City Detention Center (either because they \ncould not post a bond or are held without bond). \n7.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class Members base their claims \non the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits \nsubjecting persons arrested on crimes not involving weapons or drugs to strip \nsearches without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable \ncause that the person was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. \n8.  Plaintiffs Dana West, Eric Jones, and Gary Saunders also seek to \nrepresent a class of arrestees (the “Non-Private Strip Search Class”) who were \nsubjected to strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches by employees of \nCentral Booking in the presence of other arrested persons while they were held \nin Central Booking waiting for presentment before a commissioner or other \njudicial officer. \n9.  The Non-Private Strip Search Class Members base their claims on the \nFourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits \nsubjecting persons to strip searches in a non-private setting. The Non-Private \nStrip Search Class includes all persons who were strip-searched regardless of \n  4\n\nthe offense on which they were arrested because it is the manner of the search, \nrather than the lack of reasonable suspicion, that makes the search \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \n10.  Plaintiffs Dana West, Eric Jones, and Gary Saunders additionally seek to \nrepresent a class (the “Equal Protection Strip Search Class”) of persons who are \nmale arrestees arrested on all types of charges, including drug and violent \noffenses, who were subjected to strip, visual body cavity and/or squat \nsearches, by employees of Central Booking, while they were held in Central \nBooking waiting for presentment before a commissioner or other judicial officer.  \nDefendants subject male arrestees to such searches, but do not subject \nsimilarly situated female arrestees, including women charged with drug and \nviolent offenses, to the searches.  \n11.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Class Members base their claims on \nthe equal protection component of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution, which prohibits treating similarly situated men and \nwomen differently based on their gender. The Equal Protection Strip Search \nClass includes all men who were strip-searched, regardless of the offense on \nwhich they were arrested, because it is the application of the search to men but \nnot women, rather than the lack of reasonable suspicion, that makes the \nsearch unreasonable under the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n12.  Plaintiffs Tonia Bowie, David Colyns, and Gary Saunders also seek to \nrepresent a class (the “Overdetention Class”) of persons who were arrested in \n  5\n\nthe City of Baltimore and held at Central Booking for an unreasonable length of \ntime (more than 48 hours) after their arrests without presentment.  \n13.  The Overdetention Class Members base their claims on the Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, which requires a prompt \npresentment such as the one afforded by Maryland Rule 4-212(f), and creates a \npresumption of unreasonability and unconstitutionality if the pre-presentment \ndetention exceeds 48 hours.   \n14.  Furthermore, Maryland Rule 4-212(f) requires the presentment be done \n“without unnecessary delay and in no event later than 24 hours.”  The \nMaryland Court of Appeals has held that this Rule implements fundamental \nfederal and state constitutional rights.  Logan v. State, 289 Md. 460, 425 A.2d \n632 (1981). \n15.  This action is brought, individually and on behalf of the Classes, against \nMitchell Franks, Susan Murphy, and William Jednorski in their individual \ncapacities, and against the Government of the City of Baltimore and the \nBaltimore City Police Department, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for damages and enforcement of their Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n16.  This action is brought by the Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the \nClasses, against Mitchell Franks in his official capacity as Warden of Central \nBooking, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, and against the Government of the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore \n  6\n\nCity Police Department, for prospective injunctive relief to enforce their Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \nJurisdiction And Venue \n17.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) because plaintiffs’ claims are based on Section \n1983 and the Constitution. \n18.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  The claim for relief arose from \nevents and occurrences in this judicial district. \nParties-Plaintiffs \n19. Plaintiff Dana T. West was arrested by an officer of the Baltimore City \nPolice Department on January 13, 2005 on a charge of leaving the scene of an \naccident (traffic case number 0CZ82715, District Court of Maryland for \nBaltimore City). \n20. The Baltimore City Police Department, through its officers, placed Plaintiff \nDana T. West into the custody of Central Booking on January 13, 2005. \n21. Plaintiff Dana T. West was strip searched in Central Booking before \npresentment. \n22. Plaintiff Dana T. West is a male. \n23. Plaintiff Dana T. West was strip searched without reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that the search would produce contraband. \n  7\n\n24.

West was released directly from Central Booking after \nposting a bond.  \n27. Plaintiff Eric Jones was arrested by an officer of the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment on January 9, 2005, at approximately 9:30 a.m., on charges of \n2nd Degree Assault and False Imprisonment (case number 3B01637730). \n28. The Baltimore City Police Department, through its officers, placed Plaintiff \nEric Jones into the custody of Central Booking on January 9, 2005, at \napproximately 10:04 a.m.. \n29. Plaintiff Eric Jones was strip searched in Central Booking before \npresentment. \n30. Plaintiff Eric Jones is a male. \n31. Plaintiff Eric Jones was strip searched without reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that the search would produce contraband \n32. There was no legitimate security interest of Central Booking served by the \nstrip search. \n33. Plaintiff Eric Jones was strip searched in the presence of other arrestees.  \n  8\n\n34. Plaintiff Eric Jones was unreasonably held for at least 36 hours after his \narrest without presentment. \n35. Plaintiff Eric Jones was released directly from Central Booking after posting \na bond. \n36. Plaintiff Tonia Bowie was arrested in the City of Baltimore at \napproximately 1:30 p.m. on April 11, 2005 on a charge of driving on a \nsuspended license (traffic case number BL 73317). \n37. Tonia Bowie was placed into the custody of Central Booking on April 11, \n2005 at approximately 1:30 p.m. \n38. Tonia Bowie was detained without presentment for more than 48 hours \nafter her arrest, until approximately 10:39 p.m. on April 13, 2005 (57 hours, 9 \nminutes).   \n39. Tonia Bowie was released on personal recognizance directly from Central \nBooking. \n40. Plaintiff David Colyns was arrested by an officer of the Baltimore City \nPolice Department on November 30, 2004 at approximately 8:30 a.m., on \ncharges of possessing a pocket knife and possessing paraphernalia (needles) \n(case number 0B01658895). \n41. The Baltimore City Police Department, through its officer, placed Plaintiff \nDavid Colyns into the custody of Central Booking on November 30, 2004, at \napproximately 10:00 a.m. \n  9\n\n42. David Colyns was detained without presentment for more than 48 hours \nafter his arrest, until approximately 1:33 a.m. on December 3, 2004 (65 hours, \n16 minutes).  \n43. David Colyns was released on personal recognizance directly from Central \nBooking. \n44. Plaintiff Gary Saunders has been arrested in the City of Baltimore on \nnumerous occasions during the class period.   \n45. In addition to approximately two Open Container Alcohol and/or other \nminor arrests during the class period for which he was not charged (the dates \nand times of which Defendants have notice through the arrest booking system \nand other databases), Mr. Saunders was arrested in the City of Baltimore on \nthe following dates: on August 8, 2002 by an officer of the Baltimore Police \nDepartment on a charge of misdemeanor theft (6B01464119); on November 18, \n2002 on warrants for failure to appear in two Open Alcohol Container cases \n(4B01461940 and 4B01461996); on September 14, 2004 at 2:00 p.m. on \ncharges of trespassing and disorderly; and on February 19, 2005 by an officer \nof the Baltimore City Police Department on a charge of trespassing \n(3B01670539).   \n46. On each occasion, Mr. Saunders was taken to and placed in the custody of \nCentral Booking. \n47. On each occasion, Gary Saunders was strip searched in Central Booking \n  10\n\nbefore presentment. \n48. None of the searches of Mr. Saunders was based on reasonable suspicion \nthat the strip search would produce contraband. \n49. None of the searches of Mr. Saunders served a legitimate security interest \nof Central Booking. \n50. Gary Saunders is a male. \n51. On each occasion Gary Saunders was strip searched in the presence of \nother arrestees.  \n52. After his arrest at 2:00 p.m. on September 14, 2004 (for failing to leave a \nbus stop after being told he could not take an earlier bus), Mr. Saunders was \ndetained without presentment for more than 48 hours until 1:31 a.m. on \nSeptember 17, 2004 (59 hours, 57 minutes). \n53. Since Central Booking opened in 1995, Gary Saunders has been arrested \nin the City of Baltimore and placed into the custody of Central Booking more \nthan 50 times and strip searched each time, and has standing to seek future \ninjunctive relief because he is reasonably likely to be re-admitted to Central \nBooking and injured by the illegal strip search practices. \nParties-Defendants \n54.  Defendant Mitchell Franks has been warden of Central Booking since \nJuly 6, 2005.  He is sued in his official and individual capacities.  The section \n  11\n\n1983 claim against him in his official capacity is for prospective injunctive relief \nonly.   \n55.  Defendant Susan Murphy was acting warden of Central Booking \nbeginning March 2004 and official warden from July 2004 until July 6, 2005. \nDefendant Susan Murphy was an assistant warden at Central Booking for \nseveral years before being appointed Warden.  She is sued in her individual \ncapacity.    \n56.  Defendant William Jednorski was warden of Central Booking from May \n12, 2002 until March 2004.  He is sued in his individual capacity.   \n57.  Because Defendants Mitchell Franks, Susan Murphy, and William \nJednorski were wardens responsible for the operation of Central Booking at \ndifferent times, certain allegations are made herein with reference to the “the \nWarden.”  Such allegations refer to each of these Defendants for the time \nperiod during which he or she was warden. \n58.  At all times described herein, Defendants Mitchell Franks, Susan \nMurphy, and William Jednorski were acting under color of state law. \n59.  At all times described herein, Defendants Mitchell Franks, Susan \nMurphy, and William Jednorski were acting within the scope of his and her \nemployment. \n60.  Wherever in this Complaint “Central Booking” may be alleged to have \ndone or not done an act, or had or lacked a policy or practice, such allegation \n  12\n\nis intended as an allegation against the respective Warden, and done by him or \nher or caused by his or her acts, policies, and practices, or lack thereof. \n61.  Defendant Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (“City of Baltimore” or \n“City”) is a municipal corporation with power to sue or be sued in any court. \n62.  Defendant Baltimore City Police Department (“BPD”) is, for the purposes \nof 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a local government entity. \n63.  The BPD Commissioner is appointed by the Mayor of the City of \nBaltimore; the organizational chart of the City of Baltimore lists the BPD as a \ndepartment of the City; the BPD is under the control of the City; and officers of \nthe BPD perform police functions typical of a municipal, not state, government \npolice department. \n64.  Defendant BPD is, for all relevant legal and practical purposes herein, \npart of the government of the City of Baltimore.  For the purposes of this \nComplaint, “Baltimore City Police Department” or “BPD” is intended to include \nthe Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. \n65.  There are other police agencies within the City of Baltimore that are, for \nall relevant legal and practical purposes herein, part of the government of the \nCity of Baltimore and under the control of the Mayor and City Council of \nBaltimore, such as the Baltimore City Housing police.  Such police agencies \nhave made arrests during the class period on behalf of the City of Baltimore \nand committed such persons to Central Booking.    \n  13\n\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nCentral Booking \n66.  The Baltimore Central Booking and Central Intake Center opened in \n1995 as the central location for booking and processing arrestees in Baltimore \nCity.   \n67.  Central Booking is an agency of the Division of Pretrial Detention and \nServices, which in turn is a division of the Maryland Department of Public \nSafety and Correctional Services. \n68.  The Division of Pretrial Detention and Services has jurisdiction over three \nagencies which handle the booking, processing, custody and control of \nBaltimore City arrestees:  \n  a.  The Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center; \n  b.  The Baltimore City Detention Center (“Detention Center”); and \n  c.  The Pretrial Release Service Program. \n69.  Approximately 100,000 arrestees are processed yearly in Central \nBooking.  \n70.  Central Booking is not a detention center where persons are held \npending trial or in a post conviction stage \n71.  Some persons detained and awaiting trial, while waiting for space at the \n  14\n\nDetention Center, may remain at Central Booking temporarily and housed \nseparately in different locations from pre-presentment arrestees.  \n72.  The Baltimore City Detention Center is the pretrial detention facility for \npersons arrested in the City of Baltimore and detained while awaiting trial. \n73.   The Detention Center is in a separate building from Central Booking. \n74.  In the City of Baltimore, persons arrested in the City of Baltimore, \nincluding persons arrested by the Baltimore City Police Department and other \npolice agencies under the authority and control of the City of Baltimore, are \ntaken by the police to Central Booking for booking and processing.   \n75.  Central Booking contains a central booking unit, a medical unit, a \nclassification unit, records unit, court commissioner's offices, video bail \nfacilities, and a computerized Arrest Booking System.  \n76.  The Arrest Booking System provides fingerprint based identification of \noffenders utilizing Live Scan fingerprint technology, coupled with the State of \nMaryland’s Automated Fingerprint Identification System. \n77.  The Live Scan system employs technology that enables a positive \nidentification of persons, that is, an identification based on the unique, \nbiometric characteristic of fingerprints. \n78.  Many persons taken to Central Booking are arrestees who are brought in \non very minor charges that could have been processed through citations (a \ncitation is an order by a police officer to appear in court on a specified date \n  15\n\nwithout an arrest).  \n79.  Police officials have identified the use of citations as one way to reduce \nthe number of minor offenders who end up at Central Booking.   \n80.  However, the BPD and the City of Baltimore have failed to use citations \nin lieu of arrests due to a gross failure to properly train their officers in the \nproper methods for completing and issuing citations, and due to a desire and \npractice of summarily imprisoning persons for prior crimes believed to have \nbeen possibly committed. \n81.  The BPD and the City of Baltimore have further failed to use sufficient \ndiscretion in the decision of whether to arrest persons; have rewarded police \nofficers for the quantity of arrests regardless of whether the arrests are based \non probable cause, amounting to an arrest quota system; have encouraged and \nratified overly aggressive and unconstitutional policing of streets and false \narrests; and have failed to sufficiently train and encourage the prompt filing of \narrest paperwork and entry of data into the arrest booking system. \n82.  Approximately one-third of the people whom city police arrest, and \ncommit to Central Booking, not including those picked up on warrants, never \neven face charges, such as where prosecutors determine that there is not \nenough evidence to support a charge, or that the alleged wrongdoing, such as \nloitering, was abated by the arrest, and “decline” the case, that is, decline to \nprosecute the case. \n83.  The percentage of persons arrested by the BPD and the City of Baltimore, \n  16\n\ncommitted to Central Booking, but not charged dwarfs the percentages in other \nMaryland jurisdictions, which have had “no charge” rates of less than one-half \nof 1 percent. \n84.  Persons arrested by BPD, committed to Central Booking, but not charged \nare so commonplace among Central Booking arrestees that they are referred to \nby Central Booking officials and others by a descriptive name:  “Walk \nThroughs.”  \n85.  The BPD and the City have failed to use other options available in lieu of \ntaking arrestees to Central Booking. \n86.  Persons arrested in warrantless arrests and committed to Central \nBooking are held at Central Booking following arrest until their presentment \nbefore a commissioner for a probable cause determination, pretrial release \ndetermination, and other reasons.  \n87.  Persons who are ordered detained before trial, or who are ordered held \npending posting of bond, are held in Central Booking before being “committed” \nto the “Towers,” that is, the Baltimore City Detention Center.   \n88.  Persons ordered released at presentment are segregated from the \n“committed” persons in separate holding areas pending release.   \n89.  Persons ordered committed at presentment are held separately from both \npersons awaiting presentment, and persons ordered released at presentment. \n90.  In 2000, Central Booking processed 66,541 male arrestees and 15,854 \n  17\n\nfemale arrestees.   \n91.  Of the 82,395 people processed, 38,123 were released on their own \nrecognizance.   \n92.  Central Booking was designed to process up to 45,000 arrestees \nannually. \n93.  However, despite already exceeding Central Booking’s capacity in 2000, \nthe BPD and the City of Baltimore, rather than look for ways to reduce the \nnumber of persons arrested or, once arrested, the number of arrested persons \ntaken to Central Booking, escalated the number of arrests and took them all to \nCentral Booking.   \n94.  The number of persons arrested each year in the City by BPD and taken \nto Central Booking by BPD has steadily increased since 2000 and now exceeds \n100,000 persons per year. \n95.  The BPD and the City have throughout the class period continued to \narrest and commit persons to Central Booking knowing that Central Booking \nhas been operating in excess of full capacity throughout the class period. \n96.  Central Booking has no effective management system for booking and \nprocessing arrestees.  \n97.  Central Booking does not maintain and update its computerized booking \nand inmate management systems and has allowed its booking and processing \nand inmate management systems to collapse. \n  18\n\n98.  The Wardens have maintained a policy and practice of maintaining a \npresentment and detention policy at Central Booking that simply delays all \npresentments and detains arrestees until the system, in its sweet time, and \nwith the resources it chooses, is ready to make presentments. \n99.  The fact that Central Booking has no effective booking or inmate \nmanagement system has been documented by a series of reports and \nnewspaper articles, as well as by court cases dating back many years.   \n100.  At the extreme end, the fundamental dysfunction and mismanagement of \nCentral Booking led to the May 2005 beating death by guards of a 52-year-old \nman detained on a $150.00 bond.   \n101.  During the class period and before, Central Booking has had problems \nstopping the flow of contraband into Central Booking by Central Booking \nofficers. \n102.  The City of Baltimore has described Central Booking as “dysfunctional” \nand lacking “appropriate or adequate management systems and practices to \nassure performance and accountability.”  COMPLAINT OF THE MAYOR AND CITY OF \nBALTIMORE, filed against Warden Susan Murphy, Rodney et al. v. Murphy, \nCircuit Court for Baltimore City, 24-C-05-004405, ¶¶ 8-9 (June 29, 2005). \n103.  The overcrowding and overdetentions are a longstanding, pervasive and \ncontinuing problem known to defendants during the class period. \n104.  The detention and release of arrestees in Central Booking is currently \n  19\n\ngoverned partly by a temporary restraining order (the “Order”) issued in the \ncase of Richard Rodney et al. v. Susan Murphy, Circuit Court for Baltimore \nCity, case number 24-C-05004405.   \n105.  The Order requires the warden of Central Booking to present each \narrested person to a judicial officer no later than 24 hours after arrest, and to \nrelease any arrested person upon their being held for more than 24 hours \nwithout presentment, subject to the warden’s right to move the court for \ncontinued detention of such a person upon a showing of good cause.   \n106.  The Order has been extended to February 9, 2006.  \n107.  Upon information and belief, the Order has led to a reduction of the \nnumber of arrestees held more than 48 hours without presentment. \n108.  The Order did not enable Central Booking, the City, and the BPD to do \nanything they could have not done during and before the class period, had they \ndesired to do so and cease violating the constitutional rights of arrestees. \n109.  The Order does not address the strip searching of arrested persons. \nThe Warden’s Responsibilities For Arrestees \nAt Central Booking \n \n95.  The Warden’s duties include training, supervising, monitoring and \ndisciplining Booking Center staff. \n96.  The Warden’s duties also include formulating, implementing, and \nexecuting policies concerning the operation of Central Booking facilities.  \n  20\n\n97.  These duties include promulgating and implementing policies controlling \nthe strip searches of arrestees, and promulgating and implementing policies \nensuring the prompt presentment of arrestees, and the release of arrestees \nfollowing their presentments.  \n98.  The Warden has day-to-day training, supervisory, and disciplinary \nauthority for all operations of Central Booking. \n99.  The Warden is also responsible for ensuring that each employee of \nCentral Booking discharges his or her duties in accordance with the law and \ncourt orders. \n100.  For each arrested person brought to Central Booking, the Warden “holds \nthe key to the cell” and has the power and ability to release arrestees arrested \nin warrantless arrests up and until a judicial officer issues a commitment order \nfor an arrestee. \n101.  The Warden has the authority under the U.S. Constitution to release, or \nto order the release of, persons arrested in warrantless arrests if the arrestees \nhave not had a probable cause hearing within 48 hours of arrest, absent \nexceptional circumstances. \n102.  At all times throughout the class period, the Warden has access to the \nArrest Booking System and other data giving him or her same-time actual or \nconstructive knowledge of the following:  (a) the date and time each and every \nperson was arrested; (b) the fact that the person is placed into the custody of \n  21\n\nCentral Booking; (c) the gender of the person; (d) the charges on which the \nperson was arrested; (e) the date and time the person is brought into Central \nBooking; and (f) the fact that each and every person detained without \npresentment for more than 48 hours after arrest, or for an otherwise \nunreasonable length of time, is being so detained. \n103.  The Arrest Booking System maintained during the class period has had a \nqueuing system that continuously tracks the amount of time each arrestee has \nbeen detained at Central Booking without presentment, and shows where the \nperson is in the booking process.   \nCentral Booking Practice Of Strip Searching Arrestees \n104.  As used herein, “strip search” includes the removal, pulling down, or \nrearrangement of clothing for the visual inspection of an arrested person’s \ngenital and/or anal areas, which may also include requiring the person to \nsquat and cough, in the presence of guards and other inmates. \n105.  During the class period Central Booking has had and continues to have a \nwritten policy that allows male arrestees to be automatically searched to their \nunderwear, and then strip searched for whatever reason, in any manner, and \nin the presence of other arrested males, if the searching officer for any reason \nsuspects – reasonably or not -- that the arrested male is concealing \ncontraband.  \n106.   Meanwhile, Central Booking has had and continues to have a written \n  22\n\npolicy whereby similarly situated women are, instead of being searched to their \nunderwear, patted down above their clothing, with no mention of a strip \nsearch. \n107.  Neither the written strip search policies nor the strip search practices in \neffect at Central Booking take account of an arrestee’s charge when deciding to \nstrip search an arrestee. \n108.  Central Booking has and has had an informal practices of strip searching \nmen in situations where similarly-situated women are not strip searched; of \nstrip searching men arrested for crimes not commonly associated with the \npossession of weapons or drugs; and of strip searching persons in the presence \nof other arrested persons and staff not needed for that person’s search. \n109.  Staff at Central Booking subject virtually all men to strip searches before \npresentment without individualized reasonable suspicion based on the \nappearance or actions of arrestees, type of charge, or other criteria. \n110.  Staff at Central Booking subject virtually no women to strip searches \nbefore presentment. \n111.  As a result of these policies and practices, virtually every male arrestee \nprocessed at Central Booking, after being arrested and awaiting presentment \non charges involving drugs, weapons, or violence, is strip searched without an \nindividual determination of reasonable suspicion to justify the search, and \nregardless of the crime with which the person is charged. \n  23\n\n112.  As a result of these policies and practices, virtually every male arrestee \nprocessed at Central Booking, after being arrested and awaiting presentment \non charges involving drugs, weapons, or violence, is strip searched without a \ndetermination of reasonable suspicion to justify the search, and regardless of \nthe crime with which the person is charged. \n113.  As a result of these policies and practices, a substantial percentage of \nmale arrestees committed to Central Booking, after being arrested and awaiting \npresentment on charges not involving drugs, weapons, or violence, are \nsubjected to a strip search conducted without an individual or other \ndetermination of any kind of reasonable suspicion to justify the search, and \nregardless of the crime with which the person is charged.  \n114.  As a result of these policies and practices, virtually all persons strip \nsearched at Central Booking after being arrested and awaiting presentment are \nstrip searched in the presence of other persons.  \n115.  The great majority of strip searches of the men ay Central Booking are \nnot reasonably related to any legitimate security interest of Central Booking \nbecause the searches are not rationally related to any reason to believe the \npersons searched are concealing contraband in a place that would be revealed \nby the search.  \n116.  Central Booking does not keep any logs or other records of any individual \nstrip searches performed during the booking process. \n  24\n\n117.  Each Warden had actual or constructive knowledge of the \naforementioned strip search practices during his or her tenure, if not before. \n118.  Each Warden failed to take appropriate action(s) to ensure that arrestees \nare strip-searched upon individualized suspicion rather than based upon \ngender or due to blanket searches; or to ensure that arrestees are strip-\nsearched in a private setting. \n119.  Each Warden during the class period had actual or constructive \nknowledge that the staff of Central Booking were subjecting virtually all men \nbut virtually no women to strip searches that were not reasonably related to a \nlegitimate security interest of the institution, the Wardens were deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of male and female arrestees to be free from \nunconstitutional strip searches (or the Wardens tacitly authorized the \nsearches), and there is a direct causal link between the inaction and failure to \nsupervise of the Wardens and the injuries suffered by the men and women \narrestees who were illegally strip searched. \n120.  The City of Baltimore, and the Baltimore City Police Department, through \ntheir agents, have had actual or constructive knowledge of the aforementioned \npractices since at least 2001.   \n121.  Nonetheless, the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment knowingly and as part of its policy, practice, and custom places its \narrestees into the custody of Central Booking. \n  25\n\n122.  The BPD and the City have an affirmative duty to protect arrestees from \nharm, including the risk of violations of constitutional rights by a third party to \nwhom the arrestees are transferred. \n123.  The BPD and the City had a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm \nto persons arrested by its police officers by not arresting and committing \npersons to Central Booking. \n124.     The BPD and the City had a reasonable opportunity to prevent the \nharm to persons arrested by its police officers by not arresting and committing \npersons to Central Booking where probable cause for the arrest did not exist. \n125.  The BPD and the City had a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm \nto persons arrested by its police officers by not arresting and committing \npersons to Central Booking who, even though probable cause for the arrest \nexisted, the BPD and the City knew would not be charged. \n126.  The BPD and the City had a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm \nto persons arrested by its police officers but who could have been issued a \ncitation in lieu of arrest, including those arrested simply so that Central \nBooking could obtain their identities. \n127.  The BPD and the City wholly failed to take any affirmative act reasonably \ncalculated to protect arrested persons and prevent unconstitutional strip \nsearches. \n  26\n\nCentral Booking Practice Of Detaining Arrestees Booked Into Central \nBooking \n128.  Central Booking, despite having presentments conducted on-site, has an \ninformal practice of detaining thousands of arrestees arrested in warrantless \narrests for more than 48 hours during the class period. \n129.  As a result of these informal practices, a substantial number of persons \narrested and processed at Central Booking are detained for more than 48 \nhours after their arrests without a presentment.   \n130.  Central Booking has even detained a substantial number of persons \nmore than 3 days before presenting them. \n131.  Central Booking has even detained a substantial number of persons \nmore than 4 days before presenting them.  \n132.  Central Booking keeps computerized logs showing the arrestees’ times of \narrest, arrival at Central Booking, presentment, and release, among other \nevents. \n133.   Each Warden had actual or constructive knowledge of the \naforementioned practices during his or her tenure, if not before. \n134.  The Warden failed to take appropriate action(s) to reduce the demands \non Central Booking or increase the capacity of Central Booking to process more \narrestees, such that arrested persons brought to Central Booking could be \nprocessed in a timely manner. \n  27\n\n135.  Each Warden has had same-time actual or constructive knowledge the \nmoment each and every person was being detained without presentment \nbeyond 48 hours after arrest, but failed to either release each such person at \nthe expiration of 48 hours or ensure that each such person was presented to a \ncommissioner or other judicial officer, and instead continued to detain each \nsuch person without presentment.  \n136.  Each Warden during the class period had actual or constructive \nknowledge that the staff of Central Booking were not presenting arrestees \nbefore 48 hours, the Wardens were deliberately indifferent to the rights of male \nand female arrestees to be presented within 48 hours of arrest, or the Wardens \ntacitly authorized the overdetentions, and there is a direct causal link between \nthe inaction and failure to supervise of the Wardens and the injuries suffered \nby the men and women arrestees who were not presented within 48 hours of \narrest. \n137.  The City of Baltimore, and the Baltimore City Police Department, through \ntheir agents, have had actual or constructive knowledge of the aforementioned \npractices since at least 2001.   \n138.  Nonetheless, the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment knowingly and as part of their policy, practice, and custom places \nits arrestees into the custody of Central Booking. \n139.  The BPD and the City have an affirmative duty to protect arrestees from \nharm, including the risk of violations of constitutional rights by a third party to \n  28\n\nwhom the arrestees are transferred.   \n140.  The BPD and the City had reasonable opportunity to prevent their \narrestees from being held at Central Booking for 48 hours after arrest without \npresentment, such as by using those methods described herein above. \n141.  The BPD and the City wholly failed to take any affirmative act reasonably \ncalculated to protect arrested persons and prevent unconstitutional detentions \nwithout presentment. \n142.  In August 2005 a study commissioned by the State of Maryland that \nanalyzed the processing of persons committed to Central Booking and the \nprocesses of moving arrestees through Central Booking concluded that 24 \nhours was all the time needed to process arrestees through Central Booking \nand present them to judicial officers for probable cause hearings. \n \nStrip Search Class Action Allegations \n143.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this \naction under Rules 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years \npreceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, was \nor will be, (a) while being held in Central Booking; (b) for presentment on either \n(c)(i)  a misdemeanor or lesser offense not involving a weapon or drugs, or (ii) a \nnon-violent, non-drug related felony; and (d) strip searched without any \n  29\n\nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. \n144.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n145.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches not based on individualized or \nparticularized suspicion or probable cause. \n146.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n147.  Regarding the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and \nmembers of the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, \nbecause every member of the Class is subjected to the strip search practice, \nand none of the defendants has kept or keeps records of the searches and \ntherefore none of the defendants can show that any of the searches were \nconducted based on an individual determination of reasonable suspicion.  \nShould records exist demonstrating that such an individualized suspicion was \nused in the strip search determination, such people would, by definition, not be \n  30\n\nmembers of the class. \n148.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Booking Center have \nand have had policies, customs, and/or practices of subjecting arrestees being \nheld in Central Booking pending presentment to strip searches without an \nindividualized determination that the person was in possession of drugs, \nweapons, or other contraband; \n    b.  whether such policies, customs, and/or practices, if found to \nexist, violates the Fourth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n149.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \n  31\n\nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n150.  Central Booking has within its records the names and addresses of all \nthe current and past class members in its computerized booking system.  \n151.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are \ntypical of the claims of the other members of the class, because they and all \nother members of the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by \nthe unlawful strip searches. \n152.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and have retained \ncounsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights \nclass action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n153.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n154.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no \ndifficulty that will be encountered in the management of this litigation that \nwould preclude its maintenance as a class action, and the class action is \nsuperior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of \nthe Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class.  The class action will be \nmanageable, in part, because such an advanced computerized system exists \nfrom which to ascertain the members of the putative class.  For example, \n  32\n\nCentral Booking had stated that it has “the most advanced technological \nsystem in the world for processing arrestees.” Class treatment will be superior \nbecause liability can be determined on a class wide basis, and damages can \nalso be determined on a class wide basis through use of statistical sampling. \nNon-Private Strip Search Class Action Allegations \n155.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years preceding \nthe filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, was or will be, \n(a) while being held in Central Booking; (b) for presentment; and (d) strip \nsearched in the presence of other arrestees or staff not needed for the search. \n156.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n157.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches not in private. \n158.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \n  33\n\nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n159.  Regarding the Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and members \nof the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because \nevery member of the Class is subjected to the non-private strip search.  \n160.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Booking Center have \nand have had policies, customs, and/or practices of subjecting arrestees being \nheld in Central Booking pending presentment to strip searches in the presence \nof other arrested persons; \n    b.  whether such policies, customs, and practices, if found to \nexist, violates the Fourth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \n  34\n\nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n161.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n162.  Central Booking has within its records the names and addresses of all \nthe current and past class members in its computerized booking system.  \n163.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, because they and all other members \nof the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the unlawful \nstrip searches. \n164.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class and have retained counsel \nwho are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action \nlitigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n165.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are \ncontrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n166.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that \nwill be encountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to any other \navailable means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Non-Private Strip \nSearch  Class.  The class action will be in part manageable because such an \n  35\n\nadvanced computerized system exists from which to ascertain the members of \nthe putative class.  For example, Central Booking had stated that it has “the \nmost advanced technological system in the world for processing arrestees.” \nClass treatment will be superior because liability can be determined on a class \nwide basis, and damages can also be determined on a class wide basis through \nuse of statistical sampling. \nEqual Protection Strip Search Class Action Allegations \n167.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action \nunder Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years \npreceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, is \n(a) a male; (b) who was or will be held in Central Booking; (b) for presentment; \nand (d) was strip searched. \n168.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n169.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches of males where similarly-situated \nfemales are not strip searched. \n  36\n\n170.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n171.  Regarding the Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and \nmembers of the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, \nbecause every member of the Class is subjected to the discriminatory strip \nsearch.  \n172.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Booking Center have \nand have had policies, customs, and/or practices of subjecting male arrestees \nbeing held in Central Booking pending presentment to strip searches under \ncircumstances where similarly-situated female arrestees are not strip searched; \n    b.  whether such policies, customs, and practices, if found to \nexist, violates the Fourteenth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \n  37\n\nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n173.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n174.  Central Booking has within its records the names and addresses of all \nthe current and past class members in its computerized booking system.  \n175.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of \nthe claims of the other members of the class, because they and all other \nmembers of the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the \nunlawful strip searches. \n176.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and has retained \ncounsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights \nclass action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n177.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no interests \nthat are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n178.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty \nthat will be encountered in the management of this litigation that would \n  38\n\npreclude its maintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to \nany other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Equal \nProtection Strip Search Class.  The class action will be in part manageable \nbecause such an advanced computerized system exists from which to ascertain \nthe members of the putative class.  For example, Central Booking had stated \nthat it has “the most advanced technological system in the world for processing \narrestees.” Class treatment will be superior because liability can be determined \non a class wide basis, and damages can also be determined on a class wide \nbasis through use of statistical sampling. \nOverdetention Class Action Allegations \n179.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules 23(a), \n23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a \nclass consisting of each person who, in the three years preceding the filing of \nthis action, up until the date this case is terminated, (a) was or will be arrested \nin the City of Baltimore; and (b) was or is detained without presentment before \na commissioner or other judicial officer for more than 48 hours after arrest. \n180.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n181.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \n  39\n\ndescribed custom and practice of not timely presenting arrestees before a \ncommissioner or other judicial officer. \n182.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n183.  Regarding the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs, and members of the class, \nthere are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because every \nmember of the Class is denied a timely presentment.  \n184.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens have had actual or \nconstructive knowledge through the Arrest Booking System and other means of  \nknowledge of each occurrence in which an arrestee was detained without \npresentment for more than 48 hours; \n    b.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Central Booking have \nand have had custom and practice of detaining arrestees without a \npresentment for more than 48 hours after their arrest; \n    c.  whether such custom and practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourth Amendment; \n    d.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n  40\n\n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    f.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    g.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n185.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many hundreds of people. \n186.  Central Booking has within its records the names and addresses of all \nthe current and past class members in its computerized booking system.  \n187.  The Untimely Presentment Detention Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical \nof the claims of the other members of the class, because they and all other \nmembers of the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by their \npost-arrest detention without presentment exceeding 48 hours. \n188.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the members of the class and have retained counsel who are \ncompetent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action litigation \nand/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n  41\n\n189.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are contrary to \nor in conflict with those of the class. \n190.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be \nencountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to any other \navailable means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Overdetention \nClass.  The class action will be in part manageable because such an advanced \ncomputerized system exists from which to ascertain the members of the \nputative class, and that contains the times of all relevant events for \ndetermining the length of detention beyond 48 hours.  For example, Central \nBooking had stated that it has “the most advanced technological system in the \nworld for processing arrestees.” Class treatment will be superior because \nliability can be determined on a class wide basis, and damages can also be \ndetermined on a class wide basis through use of statistical sampling. \nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nCOUNT 1 \n191.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs re-allege and \nincorporate by reference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n192.  This Count is filed against Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski in \ntheir individual capacities for all purposes, and their official capacities for \npurposes of prospective injunctive relief. \n  42\n\n193.  While being held for presentment in Central Booking on (a) \nmisdemeanors not involving a weapon or drugs, or (b) non-violent, non-drug \nrelated felony charge(s), each of the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and every other class member were subjected to a strip search \nwithout an individual determination that the search would reveal weapons, \ndrugs or other contraband. \n194.  Subjecting an arrestee arrested on a non-drug, non-weapon \nmisdemeanor, or a non-drug, non-violent felony to a strip search without an \nindividual determination that the search would reveal weapons, drugs or other \ncontraband violates his or her Fourth Amendment Rights. \n195.  The Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that the \nSuspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and other class members \nwere being or would be subject to the strip searches and acquiesced in the \nsearches. \n196.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski failed to supervise and train \ntheir staff in strip searches when the need for supervision and training was \nobvious, and remained inactive in the face of actual or constructive notice of \nthe illegal searches. \n197.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski have each had a written \npolicy that authorizes male arrestees to be automatically searched to their \nunderwear, and then strip searched for whatever reason, in any manner, and \nin the presence of other arrested males, if the searching officer for any reason \n  43\n\nsuspects – reasonably or not -- that the arrested male is concealing \ncontraband.   \n198.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nSuspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ \nFourth Amendment Rights. \n199.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski engaged in and oversaw the \ncustoms and practices described above, which were the moving force behind \nthe deprivations to the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ \nand other class members’ Fourth Amendment Rights, and the Suspicionless \nArrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and the other class members’ injuries \nresulting from the strip searches. \n200.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski caused the unreasonable \nstrip search of the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all \nother class members by deliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional \ninjury by maintaining and/or acquiescing in a practice and custom of strip \nsearching arrestees as described above. \n201.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski acted intentionally and \nunreasonably in violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of the Suspicionless \nArrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class members  \n202.  For all actions relating to this complaint, Defendants Franks, Murphy, \n  44\n\nand Jednorski and other employees of Central Booking were acting within the \nscope of their employment, their acts were motivated by a desire to further the \ninterests of Central Booking, the City of Baltimore, and the State of Maryland, \nand such employees were acting in furtherance of the business of Central \nBooking, the City of Baltimore, and the State of Maryland. \n203.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski are therefore liable under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 for constitutional injuries to the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs and all other class members caused by their conduct. \nCOUNT 2 \n204.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate \nby reference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n205.  This Count is filed against Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski in \ntheir individual capacities for all purposes, and their official capacities for \npurposes of prospective injunctive relief. \n206.  While being held for presentment in Central Booking, each of the Non-\nPrivate Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and every other class member were \nsubjected to a strip search in the presence of other arrested persons or in an \notherwise non-private setting. \n207.  Subjecting an arrestee to a non-private strip search violates his or her \nFourth Amendment Rights, regardless of the charge or suspicion. \n208.  The Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that the Non-\n  45\n\nPrivate Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and other class members were being or \nwould be subject to the strip search and acquiesced in the searches. \n209.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski failed to supervise and train \ntheir staff in strip searches when the need for supervision and training was \nobvious, and remained inactive in the face of actual or constructive notice of \nthe illegal searches. \n210.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski have each had a written \npolicy that authorizes male arrestees to be automatically searched to their \nunderwear, and then strip searched for whatever reason, in any manner, and \nin the presence of other arrested males, if the searching officer for any reason \nsuspects – reasonably or not -- that the arrested male is concealing \ncontraband. \n211.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nNon-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ Fourth \nAmendment Rights. \n212.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski engaged in and oversaw the \ncustoms and practices described above, which were the moving force behind \nthe deprivations to the Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and other \nclass members’ Fourth Amendment Rights, and Non-Private Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiffs and the other class members’ injuries resulting from the strip \nsearches. \n  46\n\n213.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski caused the unreasonable \nstrip searches of the Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other \nclass members by deliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional injury by \nmaintaining and/or acquiescing in a practice and custom of strip searching \narrestees as described above. \n214.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski acted intentionally and \nunreasonably in violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of the Non-Private \nStrip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class members  \n215.

While being held for presentment in Central Booking, each of the Equal \nProtection Named Plaintiffs and every other class member were male, and were \nsubjected to a strip search under a custom and policy that caused them to be \nstrip searched but not similarly-situated women. \n220.  There is no legitimate governmental interest justifying the different \ntreatment between men and women. \n221.  Subjecting an arrestee to a strip search on the basis of gender, \nregardless of the charge or suspicion, violates his or her Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights. \n222.  The Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that the Equal \nProtection Named Plaintiffs and other class members were being or would be \nsubjected to the strip searches and acquiesced in the searches. \n223.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski failed to supervise and train \ntheir staff in strip searches when the need for supervision and training was \nobvious, and remained inactive in the face of actual or constructive notice of \nthe illegal searches. \n224.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski have each had a written \npolicy that authorizes male arrestees to be automatically searched to their \nunderwear, and then strip searched for whatever reason, in any manner, and \n  48\n\nin the presence of other arrested males, if the searching officer for any reason \nsuspects – reasonably or not -- that the arrested male is concealing \ncontraband. Meanwhile, Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski have each \nhad a written policy whereby similarly situated women are, instead of being \nsearched to their underwear, patted down above their clothing, with no \nmention of a strip search. \n225.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nEqual Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ \nFourteenth Amendment Rights. \n226.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski engaged in and oversaw the \ncustoms and practices described above, which were the moving force behind \nthe deprivations to the Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and \nother class members’ Fourteenth Amendment Rights, and Equal Protection \nStrip Search Named Plaintiffs and the other class members’ injuries resulting \nfrom the strip searches. \n227.

Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski acted intentionally and \n  49\n\nunreasonably in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the Equal \nProtection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class members  \n229.

Holding an arrestee for more than 48 hours prior to presentment violates \nhis or her Fourth Amendment Rights. \n  50\n\n235.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski had actual or constructive knowledge \nthat the Overdetention Named Plaintiff and other class members were being or \nwould be held for more than 48 hours prior to presentment and acquiesced in \nthe detention without presentment. \n236.  Each Warden has had same-time actual or constructive knowledge the \nmoment each and every person was being detained without presentment \nbeyond 48 hours after arrest, but failed to either release each such person at \nthe expiration of 48 hours or ensure that each such person was presented to a \ncommissioner or other judicial officer, and instead continued to detain each \nsuch person without presentment.  \n237.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski failed to supervise and train their \nstaff in the need for prompt presentments when the need for supervision \ntraining was obvious, and remained inactive in the face of actual or \nconstructive notice of the illegal detentions without presentment. \n238.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nOverdetention Named Plaintiff’s and the class members’ Fourth Amendment \nRights. \n239.

Gauvey for resolution a discovery dispute set forth in the defendants’ motion for protective\norder filed March 18, 2008.  The dispute involves three memoranda written in 2000, 2002, and 2005\nby Assistant Attorneys General to the then-Commissioners of the state’s Division of Pretrial\nDetention and Services (the “Division”) concerning arrestee search practices at Baltimore Central\nBooking and Intake Center (“BCBIC”).  By letter memorandum issued November 26, 2008, after\nhearing argument and receiving supplemental briefing, Judge Gauvey found that the defendants had\nfailed to establish the documents were protected by either the attorney-client privilege or by the\nexecutive “deliberative process” privilege.  Accordingly, she ordered the memoranda be produced\nto plaintiffs in this case.  The defendants filed objections and requested a stay of the order to\nproduce, which I granted.  After reviewing the documents ex parte and in camera, I heard oral\nargument on February 18, 2009.  For the reasons that follow, I will affirm Judge Gauvey’s ruling.\nA magistrate judge’s ruling on a discovery matter may be modified or set aside only if the\nparty objecting has shown the ruling to be “clearly erroneous or contrary to law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n72(a);  see also 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A).  Based on the record before her, Judge Gauvey’s ruling\n1\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 265   Filed 02/23/09   Page 2 of 3\nwas neither clearly erroneous as to the relevant facts nor contrary to controlling law.\nIn brief summary, and as defendants essentially concede, Judge Gauvey correctly held that\nthe attorney-client privilege may protect a communication from the attorney to the client but only\ninsofar as that communication reveals confidential information obtained from the client. United\nStates v. (Under Seal), 748 F.2d 871, 874 (4th Cir. 1984).  The burden is on the defendants to\nidentify the confidential client information contained in the memoranda, and the two affidavits of\nDeputy Commissioner Benjamin Brown fail to do so.  Significantly, no affidavits were provided by\nany author or recipient of any of the memoranda other than Deputy Commissioner Brown, who is\ncopied on the 2005 memorandum.  Similarly, the burden is on the party seeking to establish the\nexecutive or deliberative process privilege to establish its applicability, see Hanson v. U.S. Agency\nfor Int’l Dev., 372 F.3d 286, 290 (4th Cir. 2004) (FOIA litigaton), and the Brown affidavits are not\nsufficient to do so, nor is it self-evident from the contents of the memoranda that they are truly\npredecisional and part of the “give-and-take” process the privilege protects. City of Va. Beach, Va.\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 995 F.2d 1247, 1253 (4th Cir. 1993).\nThe defendants in their objections also rely on the attorney work-product doctrine, which\nwas not addressed by Judge Gauvey.1  Once again, the Brown affidavits simply are not sufficient\nto establish, as Fourth Circuit law requires, that the documents were prepared “because of”\nanticipated litigation and in preparation for that litigation.  National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Murray\nSheet Metal Co., 967 F.2d 980, 984 (4th Cir. 1992); see also Hanson, 372 F.3d at 292-93.  While\nthe documents refer to certain litigation, it is again not evident that they were drafted because of that\n1 This omission is understandable given the defendants’ failure to argue the point other\nthan by way of footnote in their reply memorandum.  (See Defs.’ Reply at 4 n.2.)\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 265   Filed 02/23/09   Page 3 of 3\nlitigation, as opposed to providing general legal advice, including non-confidential information\nabout litigation.  Accordingly, there is insufficient support in the record before Judge Gauvey or the\nobjections before me to establish that the attorney work-product doctrine bars disclosure of these\ndocuments.\nTo be clear, this ruling is limited, as it must be, to the specific facts and documents before\nthe court.  It should not be taken to mean that the state defendants could not establish and rely on\nthe deliberative process or attorney-client privilege, or benefit from work-product protection, as they\nconduct litigation in the future.  The court recognizes the importance of those protections, when\nproperly established, in the conduct of the state’s business.  For the reasons stated above, however,\nJudge Gauvey’s thorough and carefully considered ruling in this case will be affirmed.\nA separate Order follows.\n      February 23, 2009                                /s/                           \nDate Catherine C.

The matter has been fully briefed, and oral argument was held on June\n25, 2008.  For the reasons articulated below, the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment will be\ngranted with respect to the equal protection issue and the defendants’ motion for qualified\nimmunity will be denied without prejudice.\nBACKGROUND\nSoon after arrival at Baltimore City’s Central Booking, male and female arrestees are\nrouted through the sallyport and the search room (referred to, collectively, as “search room”), in\nwhich they are searched for contraband, including weapons and drugs.   Prior to January 1,\n1\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 202   Filed 07/11/08   Page 2 of 6\n2006,1 Post Orders for on-duty officers in Central Booking’s search rooms contained different\ninstructions for the men’s and women’s search rooms.2  Officers in the female search room\nreceived the following order: “Upon arrival, all offenders will be pat frisk searched,” whereas\nofficers in the male search room were instructed that “Upon arrival, all offenders will be\nsearched down to their underwear.  If the search room officer suspects contraband is being\nconcealed beneath the underwear, then a strip search will be conducted.”  (Pl’s Mot. Summ. J.\nEx. 102, 103.)  \nANALYSIS \nRule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary\njudgment \nshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\nThe Supreme Court has clarified that this does not mean that any factual dispute will\ndefeat the motion:\n1The Post Orders currently in effect at Central Booking have male and female arrestees\ntreated the same for search purposes - both men and women are required to “remove all clothing\ndown to [the] undergarments.” (Pl’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 106, 107.) \n2The parties differ sharply as to whether the Post Orders reflected actual practice at\nCentral Booking.  The plaintiffs claim that arrestees were routinely subjected to strip searches\ndown to bare skin, “either by a full-naked search or a search by which pants (or skirts) and\nunderwear were pulled to the knees.”  (Pl’s Mot. Summ. J. 1 n.1.)  For the purposes of these\nmotions, both parties assume that female arrestees were searched via pat frisk and male arrestees\nwere searched to their “last layer of clothing”; that is, to the underwear.  Plaintiffs have reserved\nfor another motion the issue of whether officers at Central Booking were actually following the\nPost Orders to limit the searches.  \n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 202   Filed 07/11/08   Page 3 of 6\nBy its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged\nfactual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly\nsupported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no\ngenuine issue of material fact.\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, (1986) (emphasis in original).\n“A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment ‘may not rest\nupon the mere allegations or denials of [his] pleadings,’ but rather must ‘set forth specific facts\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” ’ Bouchat v. Baltimore Ravens Football Club,\nInc., 346 F.3d 514, 525 (4th Cir.2003) (alteration in original) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)). The\ncourt must “view the evidence in the light most favorable to . . . the nonmovant, and draw all\nreasonable inferences in her favor without weighing the evidence or assessing the witness'\ncredibility,” Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Med. Ctr., Inc., 290 F.3d 639, 644-45 (4th Cir.2002),\nbut the court also must abide by the “affirmative obligation of the trial judge to prevent factually\nunsupported claims and defenses from proceeding to trial.” Bouchat, 346 F.3d at 526 (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Drewitt v. Pratt, 999 F.2d 774, 778-79 (4th Cir.1993), and\nciting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986)).\nThe parties differ sharply as to the appropriate level of review to be applied to the search\npolicy.3  The plaintiffs contend that the policy should be examined through a traditional equal\nprotection lens - that is, the court should apply heightened scrutiny and require an “exceedingly\n3The parties also disagree about the effect the plaintiffs’ status as pre-presentment\narrestees, and not convicted prisoners, has on the level of review to be applied.  The court takes\nno position on the matter, save to note that it appears the Fourth Circuit generally has applied\n“the same legal standard for detainees as for convicted inmates with due regard for the particular\ncircumstances of pretrial detainment,” because “the concern for security is the same for pretrial\ndetainees as for convicted inmates.”   Hause v. Vaught, 993 F.2d 1079, 1082 (4th Cir. 1993).  As\ndiscussed above, however, Central Booking’s policy fails under even the most deferential\nstandard. \n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 202   Filed 07/11/08   Page 4 of 6\npersuasive” justification for the gender-differentiated government policy.  See United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531 (1996).   The defendants counter that it is not heightened scrutiny\nthat applies, but the standard espoused in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987), under which\nthe policy must merely be rationally related to a legitimate penological interest.  Even under\nTurner, however, the gender-differentiated search policy in place at Central Booking during the\nchallenged time period does not pass constitutional muster. \nPreliminarily, it is obvious that the Division of Pretrial Detention and Services (“the\nDivision”) has a legitimate penological interest in preventing prisoners from bringing weapons\ninto the booking facility.  “Prison safety and security are legitimate penological interests that [the\ncourt] must consider.”  Veney v. Wyche, 293 F.3d 726, 732 (4th Cir. 2002) (citing Washington v.\nHarper, 494 U.S. 210, 223 (1990)).   Given that legitimate interest, the reasonableness inquiry\nunder Turner centers around four factors: (1) whether there is a “valid, rational connection”\nbetween the prison regulation and the legitimate government interest put forth to justify it; (2)\n“whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates”;4\n(3) what “impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and\nother inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally”; (4) and the “absence of ready\nalternatives.”   482 U.S. at 89-90. \nHere, it is questionable whether there existed a valid, rational connection between\npreserving safety and security on the booking floor, and searching males but not females.  On\nthis point, the defendants offer only the testimony of Deputy Commissioner Benjamin Brown,\nwho states that “[i]t was the experience of the Division that male arrestees entering BCBIC were\n4This factor is not applicable here.\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 202   Filed 07/11/08   Page 5 of 6\nfar more likely than female arrestees to have in their possession weapons, such as knives and, on\noccasion, guns, which, in turn, pose a severe threat to the safety and security of the persons on\nthe booking floor.”  (Def’s Mot. Dismiss Ex. 1 at ¶ 5.)  Deputy Commissioner Brown also\ntestified that this disparity was the only reason men were searched more thoroughly than women. \n(Pl’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 101 at 274-75.)  Brown admitted, however, that reports of this disparity\nwere “anecdotal[],” (id. at 72), because the master records kept of seized contraband did not note\nwhether the contraband was recovered from a male or a female (id. at 110-12).  Moreover, when\nDeputy Commissioner Brown was asked about “items that arrestees commonly have on their\npossession that can be used as weapons,” such as knitting needles, keys, rings, and belts, he\nadmitted that the disparity evaporated: “[a] lot of these items women might be just as likely as\nmen to have.”5  (Id. at 298-300.)\nThe defendants’ argument is even more significantly weakened when the third and fourth\nTurner factors are considered.  The Supreme Court noted that “[w]hen accommodation of an\nasserted right will have a significant ‘ripple effect’ on fellow inmates or on prison staff, courts\nshould be particularly deferential to the informed discretion of corrections officials.”  Turner,\n482 U.S. at 90.  To treat male and female arrestees equally for search purposes, however, Central\nBooking officials simply needed either to stop searching male arrestees to their underwear, or to\nstart searching all arrestees to their underwear.6  The latter is exactly what the Division\n5The Post Orders in effect during the challenged period were revised on August 20, 2004. \n(See Pl’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 102, 103.)   Given that no copies of Post Orders prior to that date\nhave been submitted, it is unclear how long the challenged policy was in effect. \n6This assumes that Central Booking’s policy of searching to the last layer of clothing\nsuffers from no other constitutional infirmity.\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 202   Filed 07/11/08   Page 6 of 6\nvoluntarily began doing in January of 2006.  (See Pl’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 106, 107.)  At oral\nargument, the defendants’ counsel did not contend that the additional searches of female\narrestees has strained the Division’s resources.  The additional staff needed to more thoroughly\nsearch female arrestees does not appear to be overly burdensome, as the policy affects only the\n20% of arrestees entering Central Booking who are female.  A similar line of reasoning applies\nto the fourth Turner factor, concerning the absence of ready alternatives on the part of the\ngovernmental entity.  Here, the January 2006 decision to search all arrestees to their last layer of\nclothing demonstrates just how readily available a constitutional alternative was to the Division.  \nAccordingly, as to the equal protection issue, he plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment\nwill be granted, and the defendants’ cross-motion for partial summary judgment will be denied. \nAlso pending is the defendants’ motion for qualified immunity.  This question must be\nanalyzed “at a high level of particularity.”  Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356, 362 (4th Cir. 2001)\n(citing Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 250-51 (4th Cir. 1999)).  In the absence of\nfurther factual development concerning the adoption and implementation of the policy by the\nindividual defendants, the defendants’ motion for qualified immunity will be denied without\nprejudice.  \nA separate Order follows.\nJuly 11, 2008        /s/                                            \nDate Catherine C.

Plaintiffs Eric Jones and Dana West bring this class action lawsuit on \nbehalf of themselves and all other male arrestees who (1) were subjected to \nstrip searches while being held in the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake \nCenter (“Baltimore Booking Center”), waiting for presentment before a \ncommissioner or other judicial officer on (a) misdemeanors not involving a \nweapon or drugs, or (b) non-violent, non-drug related felony charge(s); or (2) \nwere subjected to strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches not \nconducted in private; or (3) were subjected to blanket strip, visual body cavity \nand/or squat searches while being held in the Baltimore Booking Center, \nwaiting for presentment before a judge or other judicial officer of the City of \nBaltimore regardless of the charges against them because similarly situated \nwomen were not subjected to such searches.   \n2.  Plaintiff Eric Jones also brings this class action on behalf of himself and \nall other persons who were arrested in the City of Baltimore but were not \nbrought before a commissioner or other judicial officer within 48 hours of their \n  2\n\narrest.  \nClasses \n3.  Plaintiffs move the Court to declare four separate classes, as described \nbelow. As used herein, “presentment” refers to the initial proceeding before the \nCourt referred to in Maryland Rule 4-212(f).  The time period for all classes is \nfrom three years prior to the filing of this Complaint through final judgment in \nthis case. \n4.  Plaintiffs Dana West and Eric Jones and the class of persons they seek to \nrepresent (the “Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class”) are arrestees \narrested on (a) misdemeanors not involving a weapon or drugs, or (b) non-\nviolent, non-drug related felony charge(s) who were subjected to strip searches \nwithout any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that they were \nconcealing drugs, weapons or other contraband, by employees of the Baltimore \nBooking Center, while they were held in the Baltimore Booking Center waiting \nfor presentment before a commissioner or other judicial officer.  \n5.  The “Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class Members” are not (prior \nto presentment) commingled with persons who have been ordered detained, at \nthe Baltimore City Detention Center (either because they could not post a bond \nor are held without bond). \n6.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class Members base their claims \non the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits \n  3\n\nsubjecting persons arrested on crimes not involving weapons or drugs to strip \nsearches without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable \ncause that the person was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. \n7.  Plaintiffs Dana West and Eric Jones also seek to represent a class of \narrestees (the “Non-Private Strip Search Class”) who were subjected to strip, \nvisual body cavity and/or squat searches by employees of the Baltimore \nBooking Center in the presence of other arrested persons while they were held \nin the Baltimore Booking Center waiting for presentment before a \ncommissioner or other judicial officer. \n8.  The Non-Private Strip Search Class Members base their claims on the \nFourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits \nsubjecting persons to strip searches in a non-private setting. The Non-Private \nStrip Search Class includes all persons who were strip-searched regardless of \nthe offense on which they were arrested because it is the manner of the search, \nrather than the lack of reasonable suspicion, that makes the search \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \n9.  Plaintiffs Dana West and Eric Jones additionally seek to represent a \nclass (the “Equal Protection Strip Search Class”) of persons who are male \narrestees arrested on all types of charges, including drug and violent offenses, \nwho were subjected to strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches, by \nemployees of the Baltimore Booking Center, while they were held in the \nBaltimore Booking Center waiting for presentment before a commissioner or \n  4\n\nother judicial officer.  Defendants subject male arrestees to such searches, but \ndo not subject similarly situated female arrestees, including women charged \nwith drug and violent offenses, to the searches.  \n10.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Class Members base their claims on \nthe equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits treating \nsimilarly situated men and women differently based on their gender. The Equal \nProtection Strip Search Class includes all men who were strip-searched, \nregardless of the offense on which they were arrested, because it is the \napplication of the search to men but not women, rather than the lack of \nreasonable suspicion, that makes the search unreasonable under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  \n11.  Plaintiff Eric Jones also seeks to represent a class (the “Untimely \nPresentment Class”) of persons who were arrested in the City of Baltimore and \nheld at the Baltimore Booking Center for more than 48 hours after their arrest \nwithout presentment.  \n12.  The Untimely Presentment Class Members base their claims on the \nFourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which requires a prompt \npresentment such as the one afforded by Maryland Rule 4-212(f), and creates a \npresumption of unreasonability and unconstitutionality if the pre-presentment \ndetention exceeds 48 hours.   \n13.  This action is brought, individually and on behalf of the Classes, against \n  5\n\nSusan Murphy in her individual capacity, and William Jednorski in his \nindividual capacity, and against the Government of the City of Baltimore and \nthe Baltimore City Police Department, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil \nRights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for damage and enforcement of their \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n14.  This action is brought by the Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the \nClasses, against Susan Murphy and William Jednorski in their official \ncapacities as Wardens of the Baltimore Booking Center, pursuant to Section \n1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and against the \nGovernment of the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police Department, \nfor prospective injunctive relief to enforce their Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights. \nJurisdiction And Venue \n15.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) because plaintiffs’ claims are based on Section \n1983 and the Constitution. \n16.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  The claim for relief arose from \nevents and occurrences in this judicial district. \nParties-Plaintiffs \n17. Plaintiff Dana T. West was arrested by an officer of the Baltimore City \nPolice Department on January 13, 2005 on a charge of leaving the scene of an \n  6\n\naccident. \n18. The Baltimore City Police Department, through its officer, placed Plaintiff \nDana T. West into the custody of the Baltimore Booking Center on January 13, \n2005. \n19. Plaintiff Dana T. West was strip searched in the Baltimore Booking Center \nbefore presentment. \n20. Plaintiff Dana T. West is a male. \n21. Plaintiff Dana T. West was strip searched in the presence of other arrestees. \n22. Plaintiff Dana T. West was released directly from the Baltimore Booking \nCenter after posting a bond.  \n23. Plaintiff Dana T. West remains subject to conditions of release that can be \nrevoked at the time this complaint is filed.  \n24. Plaintiff Dana T. West has standing to seek future injunctive relief because \nhe is reasonably likely to be re-admitted to the Baltimore Booking Center. \n25. Plaintiff Eric Jones was arrested on January 10, 2005, on charges of 2nd \nDegree Assault and False Imprisonment. \n26. The Baltimore City Police Department, through its officer, placed Plaintiff \nEric Jones into the custody of the Baltimore Booking Center on January 10, \n2005. \n27. Plaintiff Eric Jones was strip searched in the Baltimore Booking Center \n  7\n\nbefore presentment. \n28. Plaintiff Eric Jones is a male. \n29. Plaintiff Eric Jones was strip searched in the presence of other arrestees.  \n30. Plaintiff Eric Jones was held for more than 48 hours before his \npresentment. \n31. Plaintiff Eric Jones was released directly from the Baltimore Booking \nCenter after posting a bond. \n32. Plaintiff Jones has standing to seek future injunctive relief because he is \nreasonably likely to be re-admitted to the Baltimore Booking Center. \n \nParties-Defendants \n33.  Defendant Susan Murphy has been acting warden of the Baltimore \nBooking Center since March 2004 and official warden since July 2004. \nDefendant Susan Murphy was an assistant warden at the Baltimore Booking \nCenter for several years before being appointed Warden.  She is sued in her \nofficial and individual capacities.  The section 1983 claim against her in her \nofficial capacity is for prospective injunctive relief only.   \n34.  Defendant William Jednorski was warden of the Baltimore Booking \nCenter from May 12, 2002 until March 2004.  He is sued in his official and \nindividual capacities.  The section 1983 claim against him in his official \n  8\n\ncapacity is for prospective injunctive relief only.  \n35.  Because there were Defendants Susan Murphy and Defendant William \nJednorski were both Wardens responsible for the operation of the Baltimore \nBooking Center at different times, certain allegations are made herein with \nreference to the “the Warden.”  Such allegations refer to each Defendants \nSusan Murphy and Defendant William Jednorski for the time period during \nwhich he or she was Warden. \n36.  At all times described herein, Defendants Susan Murphy and Defendant \nWilliam Jednorski were acting under color of state law. \n37.  At all times described herein, Defendants Susan Murphy and Defendant \nWilliam Jednorski were acting within the scope of his and her employment. \n38.  Defendant City of Baltimore is a municipal corporation with power to sue \nor be sued in any court. \n39.  The Baltimore City Police Department is a local government entity under \nSection 1983. The Baltimore City Police Department is subject to the control of \nthe City of Baltimore for the functions described herein.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Baltimore Booking Center \n40.  The Baltimore Central Booking and Central Intake Center opened in \n1995 as the central location for booking and processing arrestees in Baltimore \n  9\n\nCity.   \n41.  The Baltimore Booking Center is an agency of the Division of Pretrial \nDetention and Services, which in turn is a division of the Maryland Department \nof Public Safety and Correctional Services. \n42.  The Division of Pretrial Detention and Services has jurisdiction over three \nagencies which handle the booking, processing, custody and control of \nBaltimore City arrestees:  \n  a.  The Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center; \n  b.  The Baltimore City Detention Center; and \n  c.  The Pretrial Release Service Program. \n43.  Nearly 100,000 arrestees are processed yearly in this internationally \nrecognized center.  \n44.  The Baltimore Booking Center is not a detention center where persons \nare held pending trial or in a post conviction stage.  \n45.  The Baltimore City Detention Center is the pretrial detention facility for \npersons arrested in the City of Baltimore and detained while awaiting trial. \n46.   The Baltimore City Detention Center is in a separate building from the \nBaltimore Booking Center. \n47.  In the City of Baltimore, persons arrested by the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment are taken by the police to the Baltimore Booking Center for \n  10\n\nbooking and processing.   \n48.  The Baltimore Booking Center contains a central booking unit, a medical \nunit, a classification unit, records unit, court commissioner's offices, video bail \nfacilities, and a computerized Arrest Booking System.  \n49.  The Arrest Booking System provides fingerprint based identification of \noffenders utilizing Live Scan fingerprint technology, coupled with the State of \nMaryland's Automated Fingerprint Identification System. \n50.  The Live Scan system employs technology that enables a positive \nidentification of persons, that is, an identification based on the unique, \nbiometric characteristic of fingerprints. \n51.  Many persons taken to the Baltimore Booking Center are arrestees who \nare brought in on very minor charges that could have been processed through \ncitations (a citation is an order by a police officer to appear in court on a \nspecified date without an arrest).  \n52.  Police officials have identified the use of citations as one way to reduce \nthe number of minor offenders who end up at the Baltimore Booking Center.  \n53.  About 30 percent of the people whom city police arrest, and commit to \nthe Baltimore Booking Center, not including those picked up on warrants, \nnever even face charges, such as where prosecutors determine that there is not \nenough evidence to support a charge, or that the alleged wrongdoing, such as \nloitering, was abated by the arrest, and “decline” the case, that is, decline to \n  11\n\nprosecute the case. \n54.  Persons arrested in warrantless arrests are held at the Baltimore \nBooking Center following arrest until their presentment before a commissioner \nfor a probable cause determination, bail determination, appointment of counsel \nand other reasons.     \n55.  Persons who are ordered detained before trial, or who are ordered held \npending posting of bond, are held in the Baltimore Booking Center before being \n“committed” to the “Towers,” that is, the Baltimore City Detention Center.   \n56.  Persons ordered released at presentment are segregated from the \n“committed” persons in separate holding areas pending release.   \n57.  Persons ordered committed at presentment are held separately from both \npersons awaiting presentment, and persons ordered released at presentment. \n58.  In 2000, the Baltimore Booking Center processed 66,541 male arrestees \nand 15,854 female arrestees.  Of the 82,395 people processed, 38,123 were \nreleased on their own recognizance.  Upon information and belief, these \nnumbers and percentages have approximately continued to the present time. \n59.  The Baltimore Booking Center has no effective inmate management \nsystem for booking and processing arrestees.  \n60.  The Baltimore Booking Center does not maintain and update its \ncomputerized booking and inmate management systems and has allowed its \nbooking and processing and inmate management systems to collapse. \n  12\n\n61.  Both wardens, in their time, have maintained a policy and practice of \nmaintaining a presentment policy that simply delays all presentments until the \nsystem, in its sweet time, and with the resources it chooses, is ready to make \npresentments. \n62.  The fact that the Baltimore Booking Center has no effective booking or \ninmate management system has been documented by a series of reports and \nnewspaper articles, as well as by court cases dating back many years.   \n63.  The overcrowding, overdetentions, and premature releases are a \nlongstanding, pervasive and continuing problem known to defendants. \nThe Warden’s Responsibilities For Inmates \nAt The Baltimore Booking Center \n \n95.  The Warden’s duties include training, supervising, and disciplining \nBaltimore Booking Center staff. \n96.  The Warden’s duties also include formulating, implementing, and \nexecuting policies concerning the operation of the Baltimore Booking Center \nfacilities.  \n97.  These duties include promulgating and implementing policies controlling \nthe strip searches of inmates, and promulgating and implementing policies \nensuring the prompt presentment and release of inmates following their initial \nappearances.  \n98.  The Warden has day-to-day training, supervisory, and disciplinary \n  13\n\nauthority for all operations of the Baltimore Booking Center. \n99.  The Warden is also responsible for ensuring that each employee of the \nBaltimore Booking Center discharges his or her duties in accordance with the \nlaw and court orders. \nThe Baltimore Booking Center Practice Of Strip Searching Arrestees \n100.  As used herein, “strip search” includes the removal, pulling down, or \nrearrangement of clothing for the visual inspection of an arrested person’s \ngenital and/or anal areas, which may also include requiring the person to \nsquat and cough, in the presence of guards and other inmates. \n101.  The Baltimore Booking Center has and has had informal practices of \nstrip searching men in situations where similarly-situated women are not strip \nsearched; of strip searching men arrested for crimes not commonly associated \nwith the possession of weapons or drugs; and of strip searching persons in the \npresence of other arrested persons. \n102.  Staff at the Baltimore Booking Center subject virtually all men to strip \nsearches before presentment without individualized reasonable suspicion \nbased on appearance of arrestee, type of charge or other criteria. \n103.  Staff at the Baltimore Booking Center subject virtually no women to strip \nsearches before presentment. \n104.  The Baltimore Booking Center does not have a written policy in place \nthat permits strip searches before presentment without individualized \n  14\n\nreasonable suspicion or reasonable suspicion based on type of charge or other \ncriteria. \n105.  The Baltimore Booking Center does not have a written policy in place \nthat authorizes the current practice of strip searching virtually all men while \nstrip searching virtually no women. \n106.  As a result of these informal practices, virtually every male arrestee \nprocessed at the Baltimore Booking Center, after being arrested and awaiting \npresentment on charges involving drugs, weapons, or violence, is strip \nsearched without an individual determination of reasonable suspicion to justify \nthe search, and regardless of the crime with which the person is charged. \n107.  As a result of these informal practices, a substantial percentage of male \narrestees male arrestee committed to the Baltimore Booking Center, after being \narrested and awaiting presentment on charges not involving drugs, weapons, or \nviolence, are subjected to a strip search conducted without an individual \ndetermination of reasonable suspicion to justify the search, and regardless of \nthe crime with which the person is charged.  \n108.  As a result of these informal practices, a majority of persons strip \nsearched at the Baltimore Booking Center after being arrested and awaiting \npresentment are strip searched in the presence of other persons.  \n109.  The Baltimore Booking Center does not keep any logs or other records of \nany individual strip searches performed during the booking process. \n  15\n\n110.  Warden Susan Murphy has had actual or constructive knowledge of the \naforementioned practices since at least 2001. \n111.  During his tenure, Warden William Jednorski had actual or constructive \nknowledge of the aforementioned practices.  \n112.  The City of Baltimore, and the Baltimore City Police Department, through \ntheir agents, have had actual or constructive knowledge of the aforementioned \npractices since at least 2001.  Nonetheless, the City of Baltimore and the \nBaltimore City Police Department knowingly and as part of its policy, practice, \nand custom places its arrestees into the custody of the Baltimore Booking \nCenter. \nThe Baltimore Booking Center Practice Of Detaining Arrestees Booked \nInto The Baltimore Booking Center \n113.  The Baltimore Booking Center, despite having presentments conducted \non-site, has an informal practice of not timely presenting arrested persons. \n114.  As a result of these informal practices, a substantial percentage of \npersons arrested and processed at the Booking Center are detained for more \nthan 48 hours after their arrests without a presentment. \n115.  The Baltimore Booking Center keeps computerized logs showing the \ntimes of arrest, arrival at the Baltimore Booking Center, presentment, and \nrelease, among other events. \n116.   Warden Susan Murphy has had actual or constructive knowledge of the \n  16\n\naforementioned practices since at least 2001. \n117.  During his tenure, Warden William Jednorski had actual or constructive \nknowledge of the aforementioned practices since at least 2001. \n118.  The City of Baltimore, and the Baltimore City Police Department, through \ntheir agents, have had actual or constructive knowledge of the aforementioned \npractices since at least 2001.  Nonetheless, the City of Baltimore and the \nBaltimore City Police Department knowingly and as part of their policy, \npractice, and custom places its arrestees into the custody of the Baltimore \nBooking Center \nStrip Search Class Action Allegations \n119.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this \naction under Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years \npreceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, was \nor will be, (a) while being held in the Baltimore Booking Center; (b) for \npresentment on either (c)(i)  a misdemeanor not involving a weapon or drugs, or \n(ii) a non-violent, non-drug related felony; and (d) strip searched without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. \n120.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \n  17\n\nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n121.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches not based on individualized or \nparticularized suspicion or probable cause. \n122.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n123.  Regarding the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and \nmembers of the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, \nbecause every member of the Class is subjected to the strip search practice, \nand none of the defendants has kept or keeps records of the searches and \ntherefore none of the defendants can show that any of the searches were \nconducted based on an individual determination of reasonable suspicion.  \nShould records exist demonstrating that such an individualized suspicion was \nused in the strip search determination, such people would, by definition, not be \nmembers of the class. \n124.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Baltimore Booking \n  18\n\nCenter have and have had custom and practice of subjecting arrestees being \nheld in the Baltimore Booking Center pending presentment to strip searches \nwithout an individualized determination that the person was in possession of \ndrugs, weapons, or other contraband; \n    b.  whether such custom and practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n125.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n126.  The Baltimore Booking Center has within its records the names and \naddresses of all the current and past class members in its computerized \n  19\n\nbooking system.  \n127.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are \ntypical of the claims of the other members of the class, because they and all \nother members of the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by \nthe unlawful strip searches. \n128.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and have retained \ncounsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights \nclass action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n129.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n130.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no \ndifficulty that will be encountered in the management of this litigation that \nwould preclude its maintenance as a class action, and the class action is \nsuperior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of \nthe Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search  Class.  The class action will be \nmanageable, in part, because such an advanced computerized system exists \nfrom which to ascertain the members of the putative class.  For example, the \nBaltimore Booking Center had stated that it has “the most advanced \ntechnological system in the world for processing arrestees.” Class treatment \nwill be superior because liability can be determined on a class wide basis, and \ndamages can also be determined on a class wide basis through use of \n  20\n\nstatistical sampling. \nNon-Private Strip Search Class Action Allegations \n131.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years preceding \nthe filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, was or will be, \n(a) while being held in the Baltimore Booking Center; (b) for presentment; and \n(d) strip searched in the presence of other arrestees. \n132.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n133.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches not in private. \n134.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n135.  Regarding the Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and members \nof the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because \n  21\n\nevery member of the Class is subjected to the non-private strip search.  \n136.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Baltimore Booking \nCenter have and have had custom and practice of subjecting arrestees being \nheld in the Baltimore Booking Center pending presentment to strip searches in \nthe presence of other arrested persons; \n    b.  whether such custom and practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n137.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \n  22\n\nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n138.  The Baltimore Booking Center has within its records the names and \naddresses of all the current and past class members in its computerized \nbooking system.  \n139.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, because they and all other members \nof the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the unlawful \nstrip searches. \n140.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class and have retained counsel \nwho are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action \nlitigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n141.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are \ncontrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n142.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that \nwill be encountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to any other \navailable means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Non-Private Strip \nSearch  Class.  The class action will be in part manageable because such an \nadvanced computerized system exists from which to ascertain the members of \nthe putative class.  For example, the Baltimore Booking Center had stated that \n  23\n\nit has “the most advanced technological system in the world for processing \narrestees.” Class treatment will be superior because liability can be determined \non a class wide basis, and damages can also be determined on a class wide \nbasis through use of statistical sampling. \nEqual Protection Strip Search Class Action Allegations \n143.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action \nunder Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years \npreceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, is \n(a) a male; (b) who was or will be held in the Baltimore Booking Center; (b) for \npresentment; and (d) was strip searched. \n144.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n145.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches of males where similarly-situated \nfemales are not strip searched. \n146.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \n  24\n\nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n147.  Regarding the Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and \nmembers of the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, \nbecause every member of the Class is subjected to the discriminatory strip \nsearch.  \n148.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Baltimore Booking \nCenter have and have had custom and practice of subjecting male arrestees \nbeing held in the Baltimore Booking Center pending presentment to strip \nsearches under circumstances where similarly-situated female arrestees are \nnot strip searched; \n    b.  whether such custom and practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourteenth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n  25\n\n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n149.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n150.  The Baltimore Booking Center has within its records the names and \naddresses of all the current and past class members in its computerized \nbooking system.  \n151.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of \nthe claims of the other members of the class, because they and all other \nmembers of the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the \nunlawful strip searches. \n152.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and has retained \ncounsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights \nclass action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n153.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no interests \nthat are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n154.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty \nthat will be encountered in the management of this litigation that would \n  26\n\npreclude its maintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to \nany other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Equal \nProtection Strip Search Class.  The class action will be in part manageable \nbecause such an advanced computerized system exists from which to ascertain \nthe members of the putative class.  For example, the Baltimore Booking Center \nhad stated that it has “the most advanced technological system in the world for \nprocessing arrestees.” Class treatment will be superior because liability can be \ndetermined on a class wide basis, and damages can also be determined on a \nclass wide basis through use of statistical sampling. \nUntimely Presentment Class Action Allegations \n155.  The Untimely Presentment Named Plaintiff brings this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years preceding \nthe filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, (a) was or will \nbe arrested in the City of Baltimore; and (b) was or is detained without \npresentment before a commissioner or other judicial officer for more than 48 \nhours after arrest. \n156.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n  27\n\n157.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of not timely presenting arrestees before a \ncommissioner or other judicial officer. \n158.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n159.  Regarding the Untimely Presentment Named Plaintiff, and members of \nthe class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because \nevery member of the Class is denied a timely presentment.  \n160.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Baltimore Booking \nCenter have and have had custom and practice of detaining arrestees without a \npresentment for more than 48 hours after their arrest; \n    b.  whether such custom and practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n  28\n\n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n161.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many hundreds of people. \n162.  The Baltimore Booking Center has within its records the names and \naddresses of all the current and past class members in its computerized \nbooking system.  \n163.  The Untimely Presentment Named Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, because he and all other members of \nthe class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by their post-arrest \ndetention exceeding 48 hours prior to presentment. \n164.  The Untimely Presentment Named Plaintiff will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class and has retained counsel who \nare competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action \nlitigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n165.  The Untimely Presentment Named Plaintiff has no interests that are \n  29\n\ncontrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n166.  The Untimely Presentment Named Plaintiff knows of no difficulty that will \nbe encountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to any other \navailable means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Untimely \nPresentment Class.  The class action will be in part manageable because such \nan advanced computerized system exists from which to ascertain the members \nof the putative class, and that contains the times of all relevant events for \ndetermining the length of detention beyond 48 hours.  For example, the \nBaltimore Booking Center had stated that it has “the most advanced \ntechnological system in the world for processing arrestees.” Class treatment \nwill be superior because liability can be determined on a class wide basis, and \ndamages can also be determined on a class wide basis through use of \nstatistical sampling. \nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nCOUNT 1 \n167.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs re-allege and \nincorporate by reference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n168.  This Count is filed against Defendants Murphy and Jednorski in their \nindividual capacities for all purposes, and their official capacities for purposes \nof prospective injunctive relief. \n  30\n\n169.  While being held for presentment in the Baltimore Booking Center on (a) \nmisdemeanors not involving a weapon or drugs, or (b) non-violent, non-drug \nrelated felony charge(s), each of the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and every other class member were subjected to a strip search \nwithout an individual determination that the search would reveal weapons, \ndrugs or other contraband. \n170.  Subjecting an arrestee arrested on a non-drug, non-weapon \nmisdemeanor, or a non-drug, non-violent felony to a strip search without an \nindividual determination that the search would reveal weapons, drugs or other \ncontraband violates his or her Fourth Amendment Rights. \n171.  The Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that the \nSuspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and other class members \nwere being or would be subject to the strip searches and acquiesced in the \nsearches. \n172.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski failed to supervise and train their \nstaff in strip searches when the need for supervision and training was obvious, \nand remained inactive in the face of actual or constructive notice of the illegal \nsearches. \n173.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nSuspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ \nFourth Amendment Rights. \n  31\n\n174.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski engaged in and oversaw the customs \nand practices described above, which were the moving force behind the \ndeprivations to the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and \nother class members’ Fourth Amendment Rights, and the Suspicionless \nArrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and the other class members’ injuries \nresulting from the strip searches. \n175.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski caused the unreasonable strip search \nof the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class \nmembers by deliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional injury by \nmaintaining and/or acquiescing in a practice and custom of strip searching \narrestees as described above. \n176.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski acted intentionally and unreasonably \nin violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs and all other class members  \n177.  For all actions relating to this complaint, Defendants Murphy and \nJednorski and other employees of the Baltimore Booking Center were acting \nwithin the scope of their employment, their acts were motivated by a desire to \nfurther the interests of the Baltimore Booking Center, the City of Baltimore, \nand the State of Maryland, and such employees were acting in furtherance of \nthe business of the Baltimore Booking Center, the City of Baltimore, and the \nState of Maryland. \n178.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski are therefore liable under 42 U.S.C. § \n  32\n\n1983 for constitutional injuries to the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiffs and all other class members caused by their conduct. \nCOUNT 2 \n179.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate \nby reference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n180.  This Count is filed against Defendants Murphy and Jednorski in their \nindividual capacities for all purposes, and their official capacities for purposes \nof prospective injunctive relief. \n181.  While being held for presentment in the Baltimore Booking Center, each \nof the Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and every other class member \nwere subjected to a strip search in the presence of other arrested persons or in \nan otherwise non-private setting. \n182.  Subjecting an arrestee to a non-private strip search violates his or her \nFourth Amendment Rights, regardless of the charge or suspicion. \n183.  The Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that the Non-\nPrivate Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and other class members were being or \nwould be subject to the strip search and acquiesced in the searches. \n184.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski failed to supervise and train their \nstaff in strip searches when the need for supervision and training was obvious, \nand remained inactive in the face of actual or constructive notice of the illegal \nsearches. \n  33\n\n185.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nNon-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ Fourth \nAmendment Rights. \n186.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski engaged in and oversaw the customs \nand practices described above, which were the moving force behind the \ndeprivations to the Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and other class \nmembers’ Fourth Amendment Rights, and Non-Private Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and the other class members’ injuries resulting from the strip \nsearches. \n187.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski caused the unreasonable strip \nsearches of the Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class \nmembers by deliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional injury by \nmaintaining and/or acquiescing in a practice and custom of strip searching \narrestees as described above. \n188.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski acted intentionally and unreasonably \nin violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of the Non-Private Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiffs and all other class members  \n189.

Defendant Murphy and Jednorski are therefore liable under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 for constitutional injuries to the Non-Private Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members caused by their conduct. \nCOUNT 3 \n191.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs re-alleges and \nincorporates by reference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n192.  This Count is filed against Defendants Murphy and Jednorski in their \nindividual capacities for all purposes, and their official capacities for purposes \nof prospective injunctive relief. \n193.  While being held for presentment in the Baltimore Booking Center, each \nof the Equal Protection Named Plaintiffs and every other class member were \nmale, and were subjected to a strip search under a custom and policy that \ncaused them to be strip searched but not similarly-situated women. \n194.  There is no legitimate governmental interest justifying the different \ntreatment between men and women. \n195.  Subjecting an arrestee to a strip search on the basis of gender, \nregardless of the charge or suspicion, violates his or her Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights. \n  35\n\n196.  The Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that the Equal \nProtection Named Plaintiffs and other class members were being or would be \nsubjected to the strip searches and acquiesced in the searches. \n197.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski failed to supervise and train their \nstaff in strip searches when the need for supervision and training was obvious, \nand remained inactive in the face of actual or constructive notice of the illegal \nsearches. \n198.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nEqual Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ \nFourteenth Amendment Rights. \n199.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski engaged in and oversaw the customs \nand practices described above, which were the moving force behind the \ndeprivations to the Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and other \nclass members’ Fourteenth Amendment Rights, and Equal Protection Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs and the other class members’ injuries resulting from \nthe strip searches. \n200.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski caused the unreasonable strip \nsearches of the Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other \nclass members by deliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional injury by \nmaintaining and/or acquiescing in a practice and custom of strip searching \narrestees as described above. \n  36\n\n201.

Defendant Murphy and Jednorski are therefore liable under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 for constitutional injuries to the Equal Protection Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members caused by their conduct. \nCOUNT 4 \n204.  The Untimely Presentment Named Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by \nreference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n205.  This Count is filed against Defendants Murphy and Jednorski in their \nindividual capacities for all purposes, and their official capacities for purposes \nof prospective injunctive relief. \n206.  After their arrests, each of the Untimely Presentment Named Plaintiff and \nevery other class member was held for more than 48 hours prior to \n  37\n\npresentment. \n207.  Holding an arrestee for more than 48 hours prior to presentment violates \nhis or her Fourth Amendment Rights. \n208.

Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nUntimely Presentment Named Plaintiff’s and the class members’ Fourth \nAmendment Rights. \n211.  Defendants Murphy and Jednorski engaged in and oversaw the customs \nand practices described above, which were the moving force behind the \ndeprivations to the Untimely Presentment Named Plaintiff’s and other class \nmembers’ Fourth Amendment Rights, and Untimely Presentment Named \nPlaintiff and the other class members’ injuries resulting from the detention \nwithout presentment. \n  38\n\n212.

CCB 05 CV 1287 \n \nSUSAN MURPHY, et al. \n \n    Defendants \n \n \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n(With Request for Hearing) \n \n  Plaintiffs, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully move this \nHonorable Court pursuant to Federal R. of Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b) to enter an \norder certifying the classes defined in this motion, approving the named class \nrepresentatives, appointing Sean Day, William Claiborne, and Barrett Litt as \nclass counsel, and granting other relief requested herein.  Plaintiffs request a \nhearing on this motion. \n  Defendants do not consent to the relief sought in this motion.  LCvR 7. \n  A memorandum in support hereof accompanies this motion. \n  Plaintiffs seek certification under 23(b)(3) (Damages Class) on the issues \nof liability and damages, or for a “Hybrid” Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3) Injunctive \nRelief and Damages Class.  The Named Plaintiffs and Class Definitions are set \nforth below. \n  1 \n\nOVERDETENTION CLASS \nClass Representatives \nKevin Adams, Tonia Bowie, David Colyns, Anthony Haig, Gary Saunders, and \nMichael Washington. \nClass Definition \nEach person who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this \ncase, was or is arrested in the City of Baltimore and then detained at the \nBaltimore Central Booking and Intake Center for more than 48 hours after \narrest without release or presentment before a court commissioner or other \njudicial officer.1\n \nSUSPICIONLESS STRIP SEARCH CLASS \nClass Representatives  \nAnthony Haig, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Michael Washington, and Dana \nWest. \nClass Definition \nEach person who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this \ncase, was or will be taken to Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center (a) \non charges or in cases not involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, and (b) \nstrip searched2 (c) prior to or without presentment before a court commissioner \nor other judicial officer. \n \n                     \n1 The Plaintiffs reserve on the issue of whether, for persons presented and \nordered released, any delays between the release order and actual release \nshould be accrued toward the 48 hour determination.  In some instances the \ndelay was as much as 8 hours. \n \n2 A “strip search” is being defined herein as the removal, pulling down, or \nrearrangement of clothing for the visual inspection of a person’s genital and/or \nanal areas, which may also include requiring the person to squat and cough, in \nthe presence of one or more guards. \n \n  2 \n\nNON-PRIVATE STRIP SEARCH CLASS \nClass Representatives \nAnthony Haig, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Michael Washington, and Dana \nWest. \nClass Definition \nEach person who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this \ncase, was or will be taken to Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center and \nstrip searched in the presence of other arrestees or staff not involved in the \nsearch, prior to or without presentment before a court commissioner or other \njudicial officer.  \n  \nEQUAL PROTECTION STRIP SEARCH CLASS3\nClass Representatives \nAnthony Haig, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Michael Washington, and Dana \nWest. \nClass Definition \nEach male who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this case, \nis or will be taken to Central Booking and strip searched prior to or without \npresentment before a court commissioner or other judicial officer. \n \n                     \n3 As set forth in the Memorandum, both the Equal Protection Strip Search \nClass and the Underwear Search Class are submitted as Alternative Classes.  \nBased on the written post orders and contention of Defendants, which is that \nmale but not female arrestees were automatically stripped to their underwear, \neach male who is not proved to be a member of a bare skin strip search class \nwould fall into the Underwear Search Class by way of the Defendants’ version \nof facts. \n  Likewise, while female search officers have testified that they strip searched \nfemale intakes, if more consistently with the post orders men but not women \nare proven to be searched to their bare skin, those men would be members of \nthe Equal Protection Strip Search Class. \n  3 \n\nUNDERWEAR SEARCH CLASS \nClass Representatives \nKevin Adams, Gary Saunders, and Aaron Ross. \nClass Definition \nEach male who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this case, \nis taken to Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center and  searched to his \nunderwear prior to or without presentment before a court commissioner or \nother judicial officer \n \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF CLASS \nPlaintiffs Gary Saunders, Anthony Haig, and Aaron Ross seek to be class \nrepresentatives against Warden Franks in his official capacity for the purposes \nof injunctive relief.  Each has standing for injunctive relief for the reasons set \nforth in the Memorandum. \n \nWHEREFORE, the Named Plaintiffs request that the above-defined classes be \ncertified under Rule 23, that they be appointed as class representatives for the \nclasses set forth above, that undersigned counsel be appointed class counsel, \nand such other and further relief as this cause requires. \n  4 \n\n \nRespectfully submitted,  Respectfully submitted, \n___/s/Sean R.

CCB 05 CV 1287 \n \nSUSAN MURPHY, et al. \n \n    Defendants \n  \nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n  Eric Jones et al., the Named Plaintiffs in this case, by and through undersigned counsel, \nfile this memorandum in support of their Motion for Class Certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nSUMMARY \nThe Fourth Circuit follows a liberal policy of granting class action treatment in cases \nsuch as this one, recognizing that certification of a class action serves important public purposes, \nincluding promoting judicial economy and efficiency, and affording injured persons a remedy.  \nGunnells v. Healthplan Servs., 348 F.3d 417, 424 (4th Cir. 2003). \nCourts routinely certify strip search class actions similar to this one, including at least 9 \nin federal courts since 2007.  See, e.g. (in reverse chronological order): \nIn re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 2008 U.S. Dist LEXIS 29083 (E.D.N.Y. March 27, \n2008) (after remand by Augustin v. Jablonsky (In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases), 2006 \nU.S. App. LEXIS 21602 (2nd Cir. 2006) \nJohnson v. District of Columbia, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9069 (D.D.C. Feb. 8, 2008) \n(challenging alleged practice of pre-presentment strip searches of arrestees) (Claiborne, Litt, and \nDay, counsel of record) \nMoyle v. County of Contra Costa, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89509 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 5, 2007) \n1  \n \n\n   \nEngeseth v. County of Isanti, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78694 (D. Minn. Oct. 23, 2007) \nSmith v. Dearborn County, 244 F.R.D. 512 (S.D. Ind. Aug. 28, 2007) \nMitchell v. County of Clinton, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48589 (N.D.N.Y. Jul. 5, 2007) \nYoung v. County of Cook, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31086 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 25, 2007) \nBarnes v. District of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. 113 (D.D.C. Mar. 26, 2007) (Claiborne, counsel of \nrecord) \nSutton v. Hopkins County, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3143 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, 2007) (denying \nmotion to decertify) \nDodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177, 183 (D.N.Y. 2005)   \nTardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) \nBullock v. Sheahan, 225 F.R.D. 227 (N.D. Ill. 2004) \nBynum v. District of Columbia, 217 F.R.D. 43 (D.D.C. 2003) (Bynum II) (Claiborne and Litt, \ncounsel of record) \nBlihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D. 607, 622-23 (W.D.Wis. 2003) \nManeely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69, 78-79 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) \nMack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 24 (D.Mass. 2000) \nGary v. Sheahan, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378 (N.D.Ill. 1998), motion to decertify denied 188 \nF.3d 891 (7th Cir. 1999) \nSmith v. Montgomery County, 573 F. Supp. 604, 613 (D. Md. 1983) (Smith II) \n  Courts have also certified arrestee and inmate overdetention classes.  County of Riverside \nv. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991) (detention for 48 hours without probable cause determination \npresumed unreasonable); Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167, 174, 189 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (certifying \nclass on several claims of falsely arrested protesters against multiple individual defendants and \napproving use of damages matrix approved by jury for damages); Bynum v. District of \nColumbia, 214 F.R.D. 27 (D.D.C. 2003) (“Bynum I”); Jones v. Cochran, 1994 U.S. Dist. Lexis \n20625 (S.D. Fla. 1994) (reference to (b)(3) certification order made in previous decision). \n2  \n \n\n   \nLiability determinations for each claim in this case will depend on an analysis of a \ncommon nucleus of facts that will not vary in the individual cases.  In re A.H. Robins Co., 880 \nF.2d 709, 741, 747 (4th Cir. 1989) (Court of Appeals affirmed certification of class under Rule \n23(b)(1) that district court might have certified under 23(b)(3), noting that claim satisfied both \nprongs of Rule 23(b)(3)).  This case presents exactly the kind of claims the Gunnells Court \ncertified because (1) defendants’ liability on each claim can be determined in one lawsuit on the \nbasis of common evidence; Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 427 n. 4, 438-39; Augustin v. Jablonsky (In re \nNassau County Strip Search Cases), 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602 (2nd Cir. 2006) (Rule \n23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to \nwarrant adjudication by representation); Smith v. Montgomery County, 573 F. Supp. 604, 613 \n(D. Md. 1983) (Smith II) (certifying Rule 23(b)(3) class of female “temporary detainees” \nchallenging indiscriminately applied strip search policy at county jail); and (2) the claims of the \nputative class members are so small that they will have no remedy unless they can get a class \nremedy.  Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 426. \nAdditionally, common issues predominate over individualized questions even on \ndamages because damages can be tried on a class-wide basis using statistical sampling, Hilao v. \nEstate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 782 (9th Cir. 1996), or a damages matrix, Dellums v. Powell, \n566 F.2d 167, 174, 189 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  \nEach class claim in this case presents one or two basic, overriding common questions of \nlaw or fact, the answers to which will establish, or defeat, liability for every single class member, \nand which is susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof.  See Augustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS \n21602 at *22 (an issue is common to the class when it is susceptible to generalized, class-wide \n3  \n \n\n   \nproof).  That is, for each claim, did the conduct (strip searches or overdetentions) occur as the \nresult of a uniform policy or practice and, if so, were the practices constitutional?  Smith II, 573 \nF. Supp. 604, 613 (D. Md. 1983);  Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004); \nAugustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602 at *22; Dodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177, \n183 (D.N.Y. 2005) (where a single issue, such as the existence of a uniform policy, is guaranteed \nto come up time and time again, issues of judicial economy strongly militate in favor of \nresolving that issue via a technique that will bind as many persons as possible). \nThe proof needed to resolve the common fact issues will primarily be, in the case of \noverdetentions, the electronic data on arrests, presentments, and releases from the Baltimore \nCentral Booking and Intake Center’s (“CBIC” or “Central Booking”) computerized arrest \nbooking system -- the “Automated Booking System” (“ABS”).  In the case of strip searches, the \nproof needed for common fact issues will come from electronic data in Central Booking’s ABS, \ntestimony and affidavits by persons subject to the procedures, and depositions of defendants and \nstaff at Central Booking. \nThe identity of persons who have been subjected to underwear searches or strip searches \ncannot be ascertained solely from the data in the ABS because the system does not have a field \nindicating that someone has been strip searched.  But, the members of the various strip search \nclasses can be identified using the ABS in combination with other information.  For example, the \nunderwear strip search class is defined as all males arrestees who were processed at Central \nBooking during a definite period.  The identities of all males processed through Central Booking \nduring anyone period can be identified by running a query in the ABS because the system has \n4  \n \n\n   \nfields showing name, sex, and date of processing in Central Booking.   Exhibit 124 ¶ 13.1 \nMeanwhile, if bare skin strip searches occurred during a certain period of time, those class \nmembers can be identified through a date-specific query.  For the Suspicionless Strip Search, \nbecause the ABS contains charge information, persons with arrest charges that would not support \na strip search can be identified.   Id.   Bryan Miller’s affidavit explains how the number of strip \nsearch class members can be established using statistical and other techniques if the search \npattern was applied to most or many but not all arrestees.  Exhibit 97.  Furthermore, if an officer \nis proved to have not followed the general practice of strip searching, arrestees searched by such \nofficer may be identified through the ABS.  Exhibit 124 ¶ 13.2\nRealistically, individual damages in these cases will be inadequate to attract sufficient \ncounsel to represent individuals on a case-by-case basis.   Class action treatment is the superior \nform of adjudication where the class members could not afford to bring individual lawsuits \nbecause their claims are too small.  See Carnegie v. Household Int’l Finance, Inc., 376 F.3d 656, \n661 (7th Cir. 2004) (“the realistic alternative to [this] class action is not 17 million individual \nsuits, but zero individual suits”); Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (fact that \nvast majority of booking strip search claims would never be brought unless aggregated in a class \naction because provable actual damages are too small weighs in favor of certification).  In fact, \nabsent class certification and its attendant class-wide notice procedures, most potential class \nmembers -- who number in the tens of thousands -- will probably never even know that \n                                                 \n1  Previously-filed exhibits are not being re-filed electronically, but will be reproduced in the \npaper copy. \n2 Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 19, 1998) (that two individual \nofficers deviated from practice not sufficient to create a material issue of fact regarding existence \nof strip search practice for women). \n5  \n \n\n   \ndefendants violated their clearly established constitutional rights, and thus will never will be able \nto vindicate those rights.  Augustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602 at *27.   \nThe alternative to certification, in the worst case, is no remedy for injured plaintiffs, or, in \nthe best case, thousands of individual suits and motions for offensive collateral estoppel \nfollowing a single favorable verdict.  Id.  In fact, class certification of the claims in this case \n“provides a single proceeding in which to determine the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims, and \ntherefore protects the defendant from inconsistent adjudications.” Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 427. \nClass action treatment of all claims in this case would provide the same benefits in the \nlitigation identified by the Gunnells Court: (1) class certification will provide access to the courts \nfor those with claims that would be uneconomical if brought in an individual action, 348 F.3d at \n426; (2) class certification in this case seems likely to reduce litigation costs and preserve scarce \njudicial resources through the “consolidation of recurring common issues,” Id; and (3) class \ncertification “provides a single proceeding in which to determine the merits of the plaintiffs’ \nclaims, and therefore protects the defendant[s] from inconsistent adjudications.” Id. at 427 \n(emphasis in original). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS CENTRAL TO CLASS CERTIFICATION \n  The Baltimore Central Booking and Central Intake Center (CBIC or “Central Booking”) \nopened in 1995 as the central location for booking and processing arrestees in Baltimore City.  \nCentral Booking is an agency of the Division of Pretrial Detention and Services, which in turn is \na division of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.  Central \nBooking processes approximately 100,000 arrestees each year (according to the State statistics, \n95,463 in 2006).  Exhibit 129. \n6  \n \n\n   \n  Central Booking has a “booking floor” for persons awaiting presentment, which also has \na few rooms dedicated for persons who have been presented, were ordered to be held, and are \nawaiting placement on another floor.  However, the only detainees on the “booking floor,” where \narrestees are processed and held pending presentment, are arrestees.  At no time are arrestees \nintermingled with other types of detainees, including arrestees who have been ordered held at \npresentment.  Arrestees are processed in the following steps (although males and females are \nheld and processed separately in different parts of Central Booking, the process for both is \nbasically the same): (1) arrestees admitted to Central Booking at the Sallyport and patted-down; \n(2) arrestees screened for medical issues (this step was not implemented in the early part of the \nclass period); (3) arrestees taken into the “search room” for strip searches or other type of \nsearches; (4) arrestees taken to booking area for fingerprinting, identification, and criminal \nhistory review; (5) arrestees held in holding cells pending presentment before a commissioner or \nrelease; (6) (for persons being charged) arrestees taken before commissioner for presentment.; \n(7) arrestees either released, or held with or without bond. \n  The deposition testimony of searching officers at Central Booking shows that during the \nclass period, from May 12, 2002, until some time after July 5, 2005, all arrestees3 were subjected \nto blanket strip searches to their bare skin regardless of charge.  The bare skin strip searches \n                                                 \n3 For their Equal protection strip search claim, the Plaintiffs have pled in their complaint that \nCentral Booking staff subjected virtually all males but virtually no females to blanket strip \nsearches.  However, the Suspicionless Strip Search Claim includes all “persons,” not just \n“males,” strip searched without a reasonable, individualized suspicion.  See, e.g., Fourth \nAmended Complaint ¶¶ 9, 193-204, and 253-265 (Document 142, filed 10/12/07).  The \ndeposition testimony of line officers indicates that during the tenures of Defendant Wardens \nWilliam Jednorski and Susan Murphy, and at the start of Defendant Warden Mitchell Franks’s \ntenure, the general practice of searching officers was to subject all arrestees (male and females) \nto strip searches. \n7  \n \n\n   \noccurred throughout the tenures of Defendants Jednorski and Murphy, and stopped sometime \nduring Warden Franks’ tenure.  As to males:  Exhibit 111 (excerpt), deposition testimony of \nEstep at 48-51, 54-55 (sometime after Franks came in as warden).  As to females:  Exhibit 114 \n(excerpt), deposition testimony of Stevenson at 22-25, 30 (end of 2005); Exhibit 115 (excerpt) \ndeposition testimony of Banks at 23-25, 46-47, 50, 70-72 (into 2006); Exhibit 117 (excerpt), \ndeposition testimony of Jones at 16-18, 20-27, 42-49 (active practice as of deposition date \n11/5/07).4   Men were searched two at a time with no partition between them.  Exhibit 110 \n(excerpt), deposition testimony of Diggs at 56-57; Exhibit 108 (excerpt), deposition testimony of \nIrvine at 77. \n  The Defendant Wardens have denied that strip searches took place during their tenures.  \nDefendant Warden Murphy and Benjamin Brown, Assistant Commissioner for the Division of \nPretrial Detention and Services, submitted Affidavits contending that the policy was to subject \nmales (but not females) to “underwear searches,” that is, males were made to take off their \nclothes down to the last layer of clothes, but not down to their bare skin.  Murphy Affidavit filed \nas Document 25, 10/7/05, appended to paper Exhibits filed herewith; Brown Affidavit at Exhibit \n116.  As set forth in the post orders prior to January 1, 2006, which includes all or part of all \n                                                 \n4  The line staff officers deposed to date have generally testified that there was a policy or \npractice of subjecting all male and female arrestees processed at Central Booking to blanket strip \nsearches during different parts of the class period; their testimony differs as to when the strip \nsearch practice ended.  This discrepancy does not affect class certification, because the existence \nof a policy or practice of subjecting all male and female arrestees to blanket strip searches is not \nin dispute; the only dispute is when the practice stopped.  When the practice stopped is a fact \nissue that can be resolved and applied across-the-board to all class members.  The mere fact that \nsome officers did not follow the practice of subjecting all arrestees to strip searches upon intake \nwould not destroy the existence of a general practice of subjecting all arrestees to strip searches \nupon intake.  Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 19, 1998) (that two \n8  \n \n\n   \nDefendants’ tenures, males were searched to their underwear, while women were not stripped at \nall.  Plaintiffs have pled this fact pattern in the alternative and base the underwear strip search on \nthis contention.  Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 the Court may certify a claim that is pled in the \nalternative per Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e)(2).  Weyrich v.

CLAIMS, PROPOSED CLASSES, NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claims \nPlaintiffs have five claims, described separately below, for which they seek class action \ntreatment, as shown in the following chart. Each class claim6 separately meets the requirements \nof Rule 23(a).  Each claim also separately meets both the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) and \nRule 23(b)(3), Smith v. Montgomery County, 573 F. Supp. 604, 613 (D. Md. 1983), and the \nrequirements for a “hybrid” class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)/ (b)(3).  Miller v. Balt. Gas & \nElec. Co., 202 F.R.D. 195, 198, 199 (D. Md. 2001), citing Eubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d 87, \n96 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (court may adopt a \"hybrid\" approach, certifying a (b)(2) class as to the \nclaims for declaratory or injunctive relief, and a (b)(3) class as to the claims for monetary relief, \neffectively granting (b)(3) protections including the right to opt out to class members at the \nmonetary relief stage).  Each claim could also be certified under Rule 23(c)(4)(A). \n \nClaim  Count/ ¶ ¶  Gender of class  Constitutional \nmembers  provision \nSuspicionless Strip Search  1/ 253-265  Males and Females  4th Amendment \nNon-Private Strip Search  2/ 266-278  Males  4th Amendment \nEqual Protection Strip Search  3/ 279-292  Males only  14th Amendment \nUnderwear Strip Search   11/ 372-385  Males only  14th Amendment \n(Equal Protection only) \nOverdetention Claim  4/ 293-305  Males and Females  4th Amendment \n \n                                                 \n6 The Fourth Circuit has expressly recognized that “if [an] action includes multiple claims, one or \nmore of which might qualify as a certifiable class claim, the court may separate such claims from \nother claims in the action and certify them under the provisions of subsection (c)(4),” provided \nthat “each subclass must independently meet all the requirements of (a) and at least one of the \ncategories specified in (b).” Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 441, citing In re A.H. Robins Co., 880 F.2d \n709, 740 (4th Cir. 1989). \n10  \n \n\n   \nSome courts treat the existence of a class as a separate implicit element of Rule 23(a).  \nHammond v. Powell, 462 F.2d 1053, 1055 (4th Cir. 1972) (prerequisite of an ascertainable and \ndefinable class stems from the concern that at the time of judgment the individual members of \nthe class will be readily identifiable).  The definitions of the proposed classes set forth in \nPlaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint easily satisfy this requirement because Plaintiffs’ \nproposed class definitions set forth general parameters that limit the scope of the classes to such \na degree that it is administratively feasible for the Court to determine whether a particular \nindividual is a member of one of the classes, and Plaintiffs can show membership in a class from \na ministerial inspection of data in the “Automated Booking System,” Central Booking’s \ncomputerized booking system.  Bynum I, 214 F.R.D. at 31-32.   \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Proposed Class Definitions \n \nCertain plaintiffs move to certify one class for each of the claims as defined below.   \n \n1.  Overdetention Class (Fourth Amended Complaint7 Count 4)  \n \nPlaintiffs Kevin Adams, Tonia Bowie, David Colyns, Anthony Haig, Gary Saunders, and \nMichael Washington seek to represent a class (“Overdetention Class”) of males and females held \nat Central Booking more than 48 hours after arrest before presentment or release, defined as a \nclass consisting of: \neach person who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this case, was or \nis arrested in the City of Baltimore and then detained at the Baltimore Central Booking \n                                                 \n7   The Fourth Amended Complaint, Document 142, filed 10/12/07, is miscaptioned as the “Third \nAmended Complaint.” \n \n11  \n \n\n   \nand Intake Center for more than 48 hours after arrest without release or presentment \nbefore a court commissioner or other judicial officer.8\n \nPlaintiffs have sufficiently outlined the boundaries of the overdetention class because “by \nlooking at the class definition, counsel and putative class members can easily ascertain whether \nthey are members of the class.”  Pigford, 182 F.R.D. at 346.  Anyone who has been held in \nCentral Booking beyond 48 hours after arrest during the class period can easily determine, \nsimply by reading the definition, whether he or she was a member of the proposed class.  See \nBynum I, 214 F.R.D. at 32.  There are no terms in the definition that require further clarification, \nand nothing in the definition would require the Court to hold individualized hearings to decide \nwhether a particular individual fell within the scope of the definition.  Id.  In fact, plaintiffs can \nshow membership in the class from a ministerial inspection of defendants’ computer records \n(taking time of (a) arrest and (b) time of presentment or release, as shown in the Arrest Booking \nSystem, and extracting information for persons detained for more than 48 hours without \npresentment).  Exhibit 124. \n2.  Suspicionless Strip Search Class (Fourth Amended Complaint Count \n1) \n \nAnthony Haig, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Michael Washington, and Dana West seek to \nrepresent a class (“Suspicionless Strip Search Class”) of persons arrested on minor charges \nsubjected to across the board strip searches pursuant to booking at Central Booking, defined as a \nclass consisting of:  \n                                                 \n8  The Plaintiffs reserve on the issue of whether, for persons presented and ordered released, any \ndelays between the release order and actual release should be accrued toward the 48 hour \ndetermination.  In some instances the delay was as much as 8 hours. \n12  \n \n\n   \neach person who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this case, \nwas or will be taken to Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center (a) on \ncharges or in cases not involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, and (b) strip \nsearched (c) prior to or without presentment before a court commissioner or other \njudicial officer. . ..  \nThe Fourth Amended Complaint defines a strip search at ¶ 8: \nthe removal, pulling down, or rearrangement of clothing for the visual inspection \nof an arrested person’s genital and/or anal areas, which may also include requiring \nthe person to squat and cough, in the presence of one or more guards.   \nThe Suspicionless Strip Search Class presents no individual questions on the issue of \nliability, or membership in the class, because the class definition includes every person strip \nsearched pursuant to the booking process, excluding those persons whose arrest charge supplies \nreasonable suspicion to search. Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 5 (class definitions excluded those arrested \nfor drugs, weapons or violent felonies); Augustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602, at *21-*28; \nSmith, 643 F. Supp. at 437. \nOnce the blanket strip search practice is established (including any time boundaries), the \nPlaintiffs can show membership in the class from a ministerial inspection of the computer data in \nthe Automated Booking System to identify persons arrested on charges not involving weapons, \ndrugs, or felony violence because the Automated Booking System captures arrest charge data for \neach arrestee and the date of arrest, which has been produced by the Defendants. \nMoreover, Defendants do not keep records establishing reasonable suspicion for any \narrestee.  Therefore, once the Suspicionless Strip Search Class Plaintiffs establish the existence \nof a policy or practice of strip searches, the burden will fall upon Defendants to demonstrate, as \nan affirmative defense, that particular searches were reasonable, which, absent records, they \ncannot do.  See Smith IV, 643 F. Supp. at 443; (burden on defendant to exclude); Mack v. \nSuffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 24 (D. Mass. 2000); Blihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D. \n13  \n \n\n   \n607, 621 (W.D. Wis. 2003);  Anderson v. Cornejo, 199 F.R.D. 228, 240-41 (N.D. Ill. 2000) \n(assuming that pattern and practice method of proof applies to class actions involving strip \nsearch policies); see also Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 360 (1977)(Title \nVII).  If the Defendants can show proof regarding certain individuals, which is doubtful, those \nperson can be excluded from the class. Smith, 643 F. Supp. at 443.  Moreover, Plaintiffs’ \nproposed class definition excludes arrestees charged with crimes such as possession of drugs or \nweapons, or crimes of violence, where the nature of the charge itself would supply the \nreasonable suspicion needed to justify a strip search.  Thus, Plaintiffs can show membership in \nthe class from a ministerial inspection of Defendants’ computer records, which show the date of \narrest and charge(s).  \n3.  Non-Private Strip Search Class (Fourth Amended Complaint Counts \n2) \n \nAnthony Haig, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Michael Washington, and Dana West seek to \nrepresent a class (“Non-Private Strip Search Class”) defined as a class consisting of: \neach person who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this case, was or \nwill be taken to Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center and strip searched in the \npresence of other arrestees or staff not involved in the search, prior to or without \npresentment before a court commissioner or other judicial officer.9\nThe Non-Private Strip Search Class presents no individual questions on the issue of \nliability, or membership in the class, because the class definition is limited to every arrestee who \nwas strip searched non-privately (males) prior to presentment.  The phrase “in the presence of \nother arrestees or staff not involved in the search” is an element of the offense and plaintiffs have \n                                                 \n9 While the Non-Private Strip Search Class, like the Suspicionless Strip Search Class, was pled \nas gender-neutral, the line staff testimony to date indicates only that males were strip searched in \na non-private setting. \n14  \n \n\n   \nalleged and will establish by proof applicable to the entire class of a practice of strip searching \narrestees in groups of two and sometimes more, and establishing this practice does not present \nindividualized inquiries.  Therefore, as with the Suspicionless Strip Search Class, once a practice \nof strip searching arrestees in groups is established, Plaintiffs can show membership in the class \nfrom a ministerial inspection of Defendants’ computer records (i.e., all males processed at \nCentral Booking, without regard to the charge). \n4.  Equal Protection Strip Search Class (Fourth Amended Complaint \nCount 3) \nPlaintiffs Anthony Haig, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Michael Washington, and Dana \nWest seek to represent an alternate class (“Equal Protection Strip Search Class”) of males (but \nnot females) regardless of charge subjected to across the board strip searches at Central Booking, \ndefined as a class consisting of: \neach male who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this case, is \nor will be taken to Central Booking and strip searched prior to or without \npresentment before a court commissioner or other judicial officer. \nThe Equal Protection Strip Search Class presents no individual questions on the issue of \nliability, or membership in the class, because the class definition is limited to every male arrestee \nwho was strip searched prior to presentment.  Once the practice is established, Plaintiffs can \nshow membership in the class from a ministerial inspection of Defendants’ computer records.  \nThis claim is now conceived in the alternative because the deposition testimony seems to \nindicate that the Central Booking line staff subjected all male and female arrestees to bare skin \nstrip searches.  \n15  \n \n\n   \n5.  Underwear Strip Search Class (Fourth Amended Complaint Count \n11) \nPlaintiffs Kevin Adams, Gary Saunders, and Aaron Ross seek to represent a class (the \n“Underwear Strip Search”) of males who were strip searched to their underwear, defined as a \nclass consisting of: \neach male who, since May 12, 2002 continuing to the termination of this case, is \ntaken to Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center and  searched to his \nunderwear prior to or without presentment before a court commissioner or other \njudicial officer. \n \nThe Underwear Strip Search presents no individual questions on the issue of liability, or \nmembership in the class, because the class definition is limited to every male arrestee who was \nstrip searched to his underwear prior to presentment.  The phrase “strip searched to his \nunderwear” is an element of the offense and plaintiffs have alleged and offered proof applicable \nto the entire class (and Defendant Wardens have conceded) that every male arrestee is strip \nsearched to his underwear so the phrase does not present individualized inquiries.  Therefore, as \nwith the other classes, Plaintiffs can show membership in the class from a ministerial inspection \nof defendants’ computer records. \n  Conceivably, every male strip searched to his skin (e.g., Haig, Jones, Saunders pre-2006, \nWashington, and West) is also a member of the underwear strip search class, because either (1) \nthey are considered two separate searches, i.e., the male arrestee was stripped to his underwear, \nthen subjected to a full skin strip search (this is how the searches are conceived in the Post \nOrders filed by Defendants); (2) if there is but one search, the male arrestee is stripped to his \nunderwear momentarily before pulling down his underwear; or (3) an underwear search might be \ndeemed a lesser included act within a bare skin strip search. \n16  \n \n\n   \nPlaintiffs conceive the underwear strip search class as a “residual” class.  That is, if a \nperson is stripped to his underwear, then stripped to bare skin, he would recover under a bare \nskin search class only.  Meanwhile, the Defendants assert that every male arrestee prior to \nJanuary 1, 2006 was automatically stripped to his underwear; to the extent that a male arrestee is \nexcluded from all of the skin strip search classes, he would automatically fall into the underwear \nstrip search class by admission of the Defendants regarding their search policies and practices.10\nThis Court may also certify the Claim which is pled in the alternative.  Weyrich v. New \nRepublic, Inc., 344 U.S. App. D.C. 245, 235 F.3d 617, 628 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (holding that \nplaintiffs may plead similar but mutually exclusive torts in the alternative); Bame v. Clark, 466 \nF. Supp. 2d 105, 110 (D.D.C. 2006); Smith v. District of Columbia, 295 F. Supp. 2d 53, 55 \n(D.D.C. 2003) (recognizing party’s right to proceed on alternate claims granted by Fed. R. Civ. \nP. (8)(e)(2)); Guerrero v. Brickman Group, LLC, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21126 (D. Mich. 2007) \n(although denying FLSA certification Court grants certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) on \nstate law claims even though one of the state law claims – unjust enrichment – is inconsistent, \nand pled in the alternative to, the FLSA claim); In re GMC, 385 F. Supp. 2d 1176, 1180 (D. \nOkla. 2005)(noting in a class action complaint context that plaintiffs may plead alternate, \ninconsistent claims and go to the jury on both). \n   \n                                                 \n10  On this theory, Plaintiff Gary Saunders, who alleges he was stripped to his bare skin \nduring the tenures of Wardens Jednorski and Murphy and to his underwear during the tenure of \nWarden Franks, seeks to represent the underwear strip search class as to Warden Jednorski (in \naddition to Warden Franks), even though his claim is that he was stripped to his bare skin during \nWarden Jednorski’s tenure.  If the factfinder believes Mr. Saunders was only stripped to his \nunderwear during Warden Jednorski’s tenure, then Mr. Saunders, like any other member of the \nbare skin strip search class, may recover as a member of the underwear strip search class. \n \n17  \n \n\n   \nC.

PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS SHOULD RECEIVE CLASS ACTION TREATMENT \nBECAUSE EACH CLAIM INDEPENDENTLY SATISFIES THE RULE 23 \nREQUIREMENTS, AND JUSTICE COMPELS CLASS ACTION TREATMENT \n \n  All of the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met for all claims.  Additionally, the claims are \nappropriate for certification as 23(b)(2) classes for purposes of injunctive relief because Rule \n23(b)(2) and the Committee Notes specifically provide for declarative and injunctive relief as \nindependent remedies.  The claims are also appropriate for certification as 23(b)(3) classes for \n22  \n \n\n   \npurposes of monetary relief because the class issues – whether the strip searches and \noverdetentions occurred pursuant to established custom or policy – predominate over individual \nissues and class action treatment is the superior form of resolving the claims.  Smith, 573 F. \nSupp. at 613.   \nThe claims are also appropriate for certification as “hybrid” classes under (b)(2) for \nliability and (b)(3) for damages.  Miller v. Balt. Gas & Elec. Co., 202 F.R.D. 195, 198, 199 (D. \nMd. 2001), citing Eubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d 87, 92 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (permitting “hybrid” \nclass to be certified under (b)(2) for liability and (b)(3) for damages).  Finally, the specific issues \nof liability on each claim (including the effectiveness of Defendants’ proffered justification of \nthe male-only underwear strip searches) is independently appropriate for certification under Rule \n23(c)(4)(A).  Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 441; Augustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602, at *18; \nValentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 1996). \nThe United States District Court for the District of Columbia earlier this year certified a \nstrip search class action similar to this one (in which counsel for Plaintiffs in this case are also \ncounsel of record).  Johnson v. District of Columbia, 2008 U.S. Dist., LEXIS 9069 (D.D.C. \n2008).  In Johnson, the Plaintiffs allege that the Unites States Marshal Service for the Superior \nCourt of D.C. subjected women, but not men, to pre-presentment strip searches.  The court \ncertified the case as a class action.  While the court in Johnson denied certification for injunctive \nrelief due to lack of standing, this case does not present similar standing difficulties.11\n                                                 \n11  The court in Johnson also declined to certify, without prejudice, an alternative Fourth \nAmendment class on the alternative theory that both men and women were subjected to strip \nsearches, as there was no evidence that men were strip searched as well.  In this case, however, \nthere is evidence both ways:  the line staff depositions suggest that both men and women were \n23  \n \n\n   \nIn this case, each of the classes satisfy the requirements of (1) numerosity, (2) \ncommonality, (3) typicality, and (4) adequacy of representation under FRCP Rule 23(a) and Rule \n23(g).  Moreover, each of the classes satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3) and \nRule 23(c)(4)(A).  \n  A.  The Class Prerequisites Under Rule 23(a) Have Been Met for Each Claim \n \n1.  Numerosity \nPlaintiffs satisfy the numerosity requirement because they can show the “impracticability \nof joinder,” including some evidence or reasonable estimate of the number of class members.  \nCypress v. Newport News Gen. & Nonsectarian Hosp. Ass'n, 375 F.2d 648 (4th Cir. 1967) (class \nof eighteen individuals found sufficiently numerous).  As the district court in Frank v. Eastman \nKodak Co., 228 F.R.D. 174, 181 (D.N.Y. 2005) noted in certifying a class of 28 claimants, 28 is \na small number of persons for a class, but it is better than 28 separate lawsuits.  The \ndetermination of numerosity is a discretionary matter.  Holsey v. Armour & Co., 743 F.2d 199, \n217 (4th Cir. 1984).  The relevant class period under Maryland law is three years back from the \ndate of filing, leading to the conclusion that the class numbers in the thousands.    \n                                                                                                                                                             \nsubjected to strip searches (though the female searches may have ended later), while the post \norders and affidavits from Warden Murphy and Assistant Commissioner Brown suggest that men \nwere discriminately searched. \nHowever, the Plaintiffs’ alternative “Underwear Search” class is distinguishable from Johnson in \nthat the written policy of the Defendants was to subject men, but not women, to underwear \nsearches, and they contend that the policy was followed.  To support their alternate claim, the \nPlaintiffs have (1) the written policies, (2) the Affidavit of former Warden Murphy, and (3) the \ndeposition testimony of Deputy Commissioner Brown, the State’s 30(b)(6) designee. \n24  \n \n\n   \na)  Overdetention Class \nThere is numerosity for the Overdetention Class.  During the class period, according to \nthe Automated Booking System data obtained from the State, at least 1,836 arrestees were \ndetained for more than 48 hours without presentment or release.  Exhibit 124 (Table 2). \nb)  Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class  \nThe strip search class members also number in the thousands.  Every year, about 100,000 \npeople, including 80,000 men, pass through Central Booking.   If the practice stopped after \nWarden Franks became warden in July 2005, then the class may consist of up to roughly 400,000 \narrestees.12\nUsing just the arrestee strip search affidavits, those affidavits evidence more than 20 men \nsubjected to the illegal strip searches on minor charges.  Exhibits 1-28.  As the men undergo \nstrip searches in groups of 2 or more at a time, the affidavits account for more strip searches and \nclass members than their number.  Moreover, a few of the affiants submitted affidavits in \nreference to numerous arrests (in the case of Gary Saunders, as many as 100 times during the \nclass period), further increasing the number of claims represented by the affidavits.  Exhibits 1, \n8, 18.  \nThese figures show that the proposed classes contain a large number of members and \nclaims that would render joinder in one suit impracticable.  Reid, 205 F.R.D. at 666.    \n                                                 \n12  This would be reduced by the number of arrestees whose charges would support a strip \nsearch; however, approximately 20% were arrested for “nuisance” violations and not even \ncharged, Exhibit 129, so without any detailed analysis, the 400,000 would include at least 80,000 \narrestees for whom the charge would not support a strip search.  Precise numbers are not \nrequired, just a reasonable basis to believe that there is numerosity.  Bynum I, 214 F.R.D. at 32. \n25  \n \n\n   \nc)  Non-Private Strip Search Class \nThe minimum class size for the Non-Private Strip Search Class can also be determined \nfrom the Arrest Booking System.  The Non-Private Strip Search Class includes all males who \nwere searched, regardless of charge.  Of the approximately 500,000 arrestees during the class \nperiod, 80%, or 400,000, were men.  \nd)  Equal Protection Strip Search Class \nOn the alternative theory that men but not women were strip searched, the minimum class \nsize for the Equal Protection Strip Search Class can be determined from the same evidence as the \nNon-Private Strip Search Class, as it includes men arrested on charges that would have supported \na non-discriminatory strip search.   \n \ne)  Underwear Strip Search Class \nThe Defendants have submitted affidavits and exhibits asserting that all men, but not \nwomen, are automatically subjected to searches to their underwear.  This class, therefore, has \nhundreds of thousands of men in it (i.e., all men processed at Central Booking during the class \nperiod until January 1, 2006). \n \n2.  Commonality: Questions of Law and Fact Demonstrate a Well-\nDefined Community of Interest \n \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the class.”  In \nSmith II, 573 F. Supp. at 612, this Court held that for a class of temporary detainees strip \nsearched without probable cause to believe that they possessed either weapons or contraband, the \nlegal question of whether defendant’s indiscriminate strip search policy was unconstitutional \n26  \n \n\n   \nraised a common question of law as to defendant’s liability, satisfying the commonality \nrequirement.  As set out in detail for each claim in the following section, Plaintiffs establish \ncommonality for each claim13 because for each claim Plaintiffs assert a pattern or policy of \nillegal conduct that affects each member of the class.  As the leading treatise on class action \nlitigation states, “when the party opposing the class has engaged in some course of conduct that \naffects a group of persons and gives rise to a cause of action, one or more of the elements of that \ncause of action will be common to all of the persons affected.”  Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg, \nNewberg on Class Actions, § 3.10 (4th ed. 2002).   \nPlaintiffs satisfy this requirement because for each class, the existence of the practice is a \ncommon question of fact, and the constitutionality of the practice is a common question of law.   \na)  Overdetention Class \n  Common issues of fact and law in the Overdetention Class are set forth in ¶ 246 of the \nFOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT and include: (1) whether Central Booking has had a practice that \nhas caused arrestees to be held more than 48 hours before presentment or release; and (2) \nwhether the practice violates the Fourth Amendment.  Smith, 573 F. Supp. at 612 \n(constitutionality of the search policy is a common question of law).  The class definition \nincludes only persons held more than 48 hours.  Under Supreme Court precedent, at 48 hours the \nburden shifts to the detaining authority having the arrestees in custody to justify the continued \ndetention.  County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). \n                                                 \n13 The First Circuit identified four basic common issues of law and fact in a strip search class \naction: “… what rule, policy or custom as to strip searches was in force in each county during the \nperiods in question; was it lawful as applied to groups or individual class members; if unlawful \nas to some categories of arrestees, were there still facts as to particular arrestees that justified a \n27  \n \n\n   \nb)  Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class \nCommon issues of fact and law in the Suspicionless Strip Search Class are set forth in ¶ \n198 of the FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT and include: (1) whether the Defendant Wardens and \nCentral Booking have a custom and/or practice of subjecting intakes at Central Booking \narrested on non-drug, non-weapon, non-violent charges to across the board (blanket) booking \nstrip searches; and (2) whether such custom and/or practice, if proved, violates the Fourth \nAmendment.  Smith, 573 F. Supp. at 612.  Plaintiffs submitted in support of their Rule 56(f) \nmotion affidavits of more than 20 former intakes covering more than 100 arrests, and other \naffidavits, establishing that Central Booking has a practice and custom of subjecting male \narrestees to suspicionless strip searches, and doing so in view of other arrested persons.  The \nstrip search allegations of the named plaintiffs are supported by affidavits at Plaintiffs’ \nExhibits 1, 2, 10, 20, 23-26, 28, and 99, as well as the testimony of Central Booking officers.  \nThe Wardens, according to Warden Murphy’s Affidavit, deny such a practice.  The mere fact \nthat the existence of the practice is a disputed issue does not preclude certification.  Tardiff, 365 \nF.3d at 5; Augustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602, at *21-*28.  The “issue [of whether the \npractice exists] is like any other common predicate to liability for multiple parallel claims -- say \nwhether the train engineer was negligent (or acting within the scope of his employment) when \nthe train went off the rails.”  Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 5. \nAs stated above, the class definition excludes all arrestees for whom the nature of the \narrest charge would supply reasonable suspicion to search (drugs, weapons, and violent \nfelonies) and thus excludes those persons who could be strip searched as a matter of course \n                                                                                                                                                             \nstrip search; and if liability exists, what are the damages to each person injured?”  Tardiff, 365 \n28  \n \n\n   \nregardless of the custom or policy of across the board strip searches. Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 5; \nAugustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602, at *21-*28; Smith, 643 F. Supp. at 437.  Drawing \ndraw bright lines according to the offenses that class members were arrested for avoids \nindividual evidentiary disputes and thus preserves commonality.  Smith, 643 F. Supp. at 437.   \nc)  Non-Private Strip Search Class \nCommon issues of fact and law in the Non-Private Strip Search Class are set forth in ¶ \n210 of the FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT and include: (1) whether the Defendant Wardens and \nCentral Booking have a custom and/or practice of subjecting (male) intakes at Central Booking \nto non private strip searches; and (2) whether such policies, customs, and practices, if found to \nexist, violate the Fourth Amendment.  Smith, 573 F. Supp. at 612.  Whether there has been a \npractice of strip searching arrestees in front of other persons not necessary for the search is a \ncommon question of fact applicable to the class.  This claim does not depend on violation of the \nreasonable suspicion standard, so the definition of the class includes all arrestees subjected to the \nstrip searches regardless of arrest charge.  \nd)  Equal Protection Strip Search Class \n \nCommon issues of fact and law in the Equal Protection Strip Search Class are set forth in \n¶ 222 of the FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT and include: (1) whether the Defendant Wardens and \nCentral Booking have and have had policies, customs, and/or practices of subjecting male \narrestees being booked at Central Booking to strip searches under circumstances where similarly-\nsituated female arrestees are not strip searched; and (2) whether such policies, customs, and \npractices, if found to exist, violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  Smith, 573 F. Supp. at 612.  \n                                                                                                                                                             \nF.3d at 4. \n29  \n \n\n   \nPlaintiffs submitted in support of their Rule 56(f) motion affidavits of more than 20 former \nintakes covering more than 100 arrests, and other affidavits, establishing that Central Booking \ndoes have a custom of subjecting male arrestees to suspicionless strip searches.  Defendant \nWardens have denied strip searching women.  Furthermore, the Wardens’ “Post Orders,” \nExhibits 102 and 103, exhibit facially disparate treatment of men and women, whereby women \nare patted down, but men are patted down, stripped to their underwear, then strip searched for \nany reason and in any manner based upon the desire of the search officer.  \nThe mere fact that the existence of the practice is a disputed issue does not preclude \ncertification.  Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 5; Augustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602, at *21-*28.   \nThis claim does not depend on violation of the reasonable suspicion standard so the \ndefinition includes all male arrestees subjected to the strip searches regardless of arrest charge.  \ne)  Underwear Strip Search Class \n \n   Common issues of fact and law in the Underwear Strip Search Class are set forth in ¶ 234 \nof the FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT and include: (1) whether the Defendant Wardens and \nCentral Booking have and have had a practice of subjecting male arrestees being booked at \nCentral Booking to underwear strip searches under circumstances where similarly-situated \nfemale arrestees are not strip searched to their underwear; (2) whether such practice, if found to \nexist, violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  According to the Wardens and their post orders, \ntheir underwear strip search policy prior to January 1, 2006 was applied to men but not women. \n  The Plaintiffs have sought partial summary judgment regarding this policy (Document \n162, filed 2/20/08).  This does not preclude certification, it simply presents a common issues of \n30  \n \n\n   \nfact and law in support of class certification.  Smith II, 573 F. Supp. at 612. \nThis claim does not depend on violation of the reasonable suspicion standard so the \ndefinition includes all male arrestees subjected to the underwear strip searches regardless of \narrest charge.  \n3.   Typicality: Class Representatives Have Claims and Damages Typical \nof the Class \n \n     The typicality requirement of Rule 23 addresses whether the representatives’ claims and \ninterests are in fact consistent and harmonious with the rest of the class.  The purpose of the \ntypicality requirement is to ensure that the claims of the representative and absent class members \nare sufficiently similar so that the representatives’ acts are also acts on behalf of, and safeguard \nthe interests of, the class.  The requirement of typicality is satisfied if the movant’s claim arises \nfrom the same course of events as those of the other potential class members and relies on \nsimilar legal theories to prove the defendants’ liability.  In re Royal Ahold N.V. Sec. & ERISA \nLitig., 219 F.R.D. 343, 350 (D. Md. 2003).  Here, for each claim common issues of law and fact \npredominate and, accordingly, there is a well-defined community of interest between the named \nplaintiffs and the proposed class members.  \n  Likewise, in this case, for each claim the named plaintiffs’ legal theories are the same as \nevery other class member’s, and all class members were injured by the same course of conduct, \ni.e., either the unconstitutional strip search practice, or the practice of overdetentions. \nFor the Overdetention Class, each named Plaintiffs’ claims (Kevin Adams, Tonia Bowie, \nDavid Colyns, Anthony Haig, Gary Saunders, and Michael Washington) are typical in that each \nwas detained for more than 48 hours without presentment or release. \n31  \n \n\n   \nThe claims of the Named Plaintiffs for the three full strip search classes are also typical \nof all claims of their nature, as each named Plaintiff, just like every member of each class, was \nsubjected to a strip search that was not private, was a blanket strip search, and, for the alternate \nEqual Protection Claim, was a search applied to men.  \nLastly, the claims of Named Plaintiffs Kevin Adams, Gary Saunders, and Aaron Ross are \ntypical of an underwear strip search claim, as each was subjected, like all members of that class, \nto an automatic search to his underwear due to the practice, policy, and custom of subjecting all \nmen, but not women, to such a search.  \n4.  Adequacy of Representation: Class Representatives Adequately  \nRepresent the Class; Class Counsel Adequately  Represent the Class \nRule 23(a)(4) demands that named plaintiffs adequately represent the class. In this case, \nno conflicts of interest exist between the representative plaintiffs and the proposed class. \nGunnells, 348 F.3d at 425.  However, for a conflict of interest to prevent plaintiffs from meeting \nthe requirement of Rule 23(a), that conflict must be a fundamental one that goes to the heart of \nthe litigation. Id. at 430-431.  The issues presented by the named representatives mirror those \nfaced by the putative class, which stands only to gain by this action.  The Named Plaintiffs have \nsigned declarations expressing their commitment to represent each class of which they are a \nrepresentative member.  Exhibits 130-137. \nRule 23(g)(1)(C)(i) requires the Court to appoint adequate counsel to represent the class.  \nRule 23(g) requires that the court must consider the following in appointing class counsel: “[(1)] \nthe work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action, [(2)] \ncounsel’s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and claims of the type \nasserted in the action, [(3)] counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law, and [(4)] the resources \n32  \n \n\n   \ncounsel will commit to representing the class.”  In re Royal Ahold N.V. Sec., 2006 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 48928, *14-15 (D. Md. 2006); Noble v. 93 Univ. Place Corp., 224 F.R.D. 330, 346 \n(D.N.Y. 2004).  The court may consider any “other matter pertinent to counsel’s ability to fairly \nand adequately represent the interests of the class.” Id.  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel have done extensive research and discovery in this case, including the \nhiring of a team of computer experts to handle and process data in the Automated Booking \nSystem.  Plaintiffs’ counsel have taken a 30(b)(6) deposition and 20 depositions of line officers \nand supervisors, and have efficiently pursued a course of discovery in this case. \nPlaintiffs’ counsel have litigated or served as amicus in several class action cases in the \nareas of strip searches and overdetentions.  Johnson v. District of Columbia, 2008 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 9069 (D.D.C. 2008) (William Claiborne, Barrett Litt, and Sean Day, counsel);  Bynum v. \nDistrict of Columbia (Bynum I), 214 F.R.D. 27 (D.D.C. 2003) and Bynum v. District of \nColumbia (Bynum II), 217 F.R.D. 43 (D.D.C. 2003) (William Claiborne and Barrett Litt, \ncounsel); Powell v. Barrett (I), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 685 (D. Ga. 2005) and Powell v. Barrett \n(II), 376 F.Supp.2d 1340 (D. Ga. 2005) (William Claiborne and Barrett Litt, counsel); Tardiff v. \nKnox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004) (William Claiborne, amicus counsel). \nAs described in their declarations, Plaintiffs counsel are experienced attorneys in civil \nrights and class action cases with sufficient staff and financial resources to prosecute the case. \nCounsels’ affidavits are attached as Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 121-123.   \nPlaintiffs’ legal team is led by Barrett Litt of Litt & Associates, a boutique civil rights \nand public interest law firm.  Mr. Litt and his firm have successfully litigated many other class \n33  \n \n\n   \nactions and multi-party public interest cases, which are detailed in his declaration. (See \nDeclaration of Barrett S. Litt, Exhibit 121).  Mr. Litt and his firms have been recognized on \nseveral occasions for their excellent civil rights work.  Id.  William Claiborne, also an \nexperienced class action lawyer with experience in class action strip search and overdetention \nlitigation, is lead managing counsel.   \n  B.  The Class Prerequisites Under Rule 23(b) Have Been Met for Each Claim \n \n  “In order to be maintained as a class action, a representative suit must comply with the  \nrequirements of each of the four subsections of Rule 23(a), (numerosity, commonality, typicality, \nand adequacy of representation) and must satisfy the additional requirements of at least one of \nthe three subdivisions of Rule 23(b).”  2 Newberg on Class Actions § 4:1, pg. 3.  Here, class \ncertification is proper under both Rule 23(b)(2), 23(b)(3), and as a hybrid (b)(2)/(b)(3) action. \n1.  Rule 23(b)(2) Injunctive Relief Class  \n \n  The current lawsuit is, in part, a paradigm of a Rule 23(b)(2) action. “Rule 23(b)(2) was \ndrafted specifically to facilitate relief in civil rights suits.” 8 Newberg on Class Actions, §25:20. \nRule 23(b)(2) is typically used in cases seeking injunctive or declaratory relief.  Id.  Rule \n23(b)(2) is appropriate if the  “party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class.” See Rule 23(b)(2).  The class representatives allege that \nDefendants’ practice and custom of overdetaining arrestees, subjecting arrestees to blanket, non-\nprivate, and discriminatory (gender) strip searches violates the United States Constitution, with \nthese unconstitutional practices and customs affecting persons on a class-wide basis.  Plaintiffs \nseek injunctive and declaratory remedies to ensure that Defendants do not resume these unlawful \npractices. The relief sought necessarily applies to the whole class. Hurley v. Ward, U.S. Dist. \n34  \n \n\n   \nLEXIS 8630 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (constitutionality of strip and body cavity searches of [visitors] \nproperly certified under Rule 23(b)(2)). Thus, class certification is appropriate under Rule \n23(b)(2). \n  As of the date of the filing of the FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Plaintiff Anthony Haig \nhas standing to seek injunctive relief because he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest that \nwould subject him to arrest and being placed into the custody of Central Booking for booking.  \nFOURTH AMENDED COMPL.¶  69.  Gary Saunders has standing to seek injunctive relief because \nhe is a “recidivist” (he is frequently arrested, regardless of whether he has committed a crime), \nand has been arrested numerous times in the City of Baltimore during the class period.  He is \nthus likely to be re-arrested and subjected to the overdetentions and strip searches.  In fact, \nduring the pendency of the litigation, on June 30, 2006, he was arrested and processed at Central \nBooking, and subjected to a discriminatory search to his underwear.  Exhibit 26.  Lastly, in \naddition to the “recidivist” and a person with an outstanding warrant, counsel for Plaintiffs met \nthe seemingly impossible task (for the facts of this case) of obtaining more ordinary standing for \ninjunctive relief by filing the FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT on October 12, 2007 during the \nsmall window between the time Plaintiff Aaron Ross was arrested and his arrival at Central \nBooking.  His affidavit, along with co-arrestee Jeannie Deibel, suggests that despite the new post \norders, men but not women were being searched to their underwear.  Exhibits 28 and 29. \n2.  Rule 23 (b)(3) Damages Class:  Each Claim Satisfies the \nPredominance and Superiority Requirements Of Rule 23 (b)(3)  \n \na)  Rule 23(b)(3): Common issues of law and fact predominate \nover individual issues of liability. \nThe Fourth Circuit test for predominance is whether a claim is sufficiently cohesive to \nwarrant adjudication by representation.  This test is met where class action treatment of a claim \n35  \n \n\n   \npresents the most efficient method of resolving the claim through the “consolidation of recurring \ncommon issues.”  Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 443; Smith II, 573 F. Supp. at 613.  See also Tardiff, \n365 F.3d at7; Augustin v. Jablonsky (In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases), 2006 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 21602 (2nd Cir. 2006). The predominance analysis should be applied on a per claim \nbasis, and not on a per lawsuit basis.  Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 443.  The fundamental question to \ndecide under Rule 23(b)(3) is whether the group aspiring to class status is seeking to remedy a \ncommon legal grievance.  Augustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602 (Rule 23(b)(3) predominance \ninquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by \nrepresentation); Smith II, 573 F. Supp. at 613.  As the district court said in Smith in certifying a \n(b)(3) booking strip search class: \nAs previously stated, this case presents a common question of law which is \npredominant over any additional individual claims. Moreover, resolution of the \nliability and damages issues within the context of a class action is far more \nefficient than individual prosecution of damages actions.  A class action is also \nthe fairest means to settle this controversy since it is unlikely that most class \nmembers would pursue these claims on their own. Thus, because all the \nrequirements of Rule 23 have been satisfied, the Court finds the certification of a \nclass for the purpose of both damages and liability entirely appropriate. \n \nSmith, 573 F. Supp. at 613. \nRecurring common issues make up the heart of Plaintiffs’ case against defendants on \neach claim.  This case presents claims similar to the claim certified in Gunnells.  In Gunnells, the \nFourth Circuit certified a single claim against a health insurance plan manager alleging that \nmismanagement of the plan resulting in its ultimate collapse similarly affected a large group of \npeople in a single state.  348 F.3d at 427.  Here, the overdetention Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendants were deliberately indifferent to the overdetentions at Central Booking because they \n36  \n \n\n   \nmaintained or acquiesced in the implementation of a release system “that simply delays all \nreleases until the system, in its sweet time, and with the resources it chooses . . . is ready to make \nreleases,” Berry v. Baca, 379 F.3d 764, 768 (9th Cir. 2004), and that system similarly affected a \nlarge group of people in a single city.  The strip search Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ strip \nsearch practices similarly affected a large group of people in a single city.   \nThe common questions of law and fact “predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual members” in this case because the allegations of an unconstitutional custom and \npractice of overdetentions and strip searches relate to the defendants’ conduct, involve at least \none common question of fact (existence of the policy or practice) and one common question of \nlaw (constitutionality of the policy or practice), and the questions are susceptible of class-wide \nproof. Bynum I, 214 F.R.D. at 39.  \nThe proof needed to resolve the common fact issues will primarily be, in the case of \noverdetentions, electronic data on arrests, presentments and releases from Central Booking’s \ncomputerized “Automated Booking System.”  In the case of strip searches, the proof needed will \ncome from electronic data from Central Booking’s Automated Booking System, testimony and \naffidavits by persons subjected to the procedures, and the testimony of staff at Central Booking. \nThe case will involve generalized evidence which will prove or disprove liability on a class-wide \nbasis, and resolution of that question will dispose of the issue of defendant’s liability to plaintiffs \nin this action.  Bynum I, 214 F.R.D. at 39.   \nThe predominance determination is related to the commonality requirement of Rule \n23(a), in that “the common issues identified as sufficient under Rule 23(a) must be shown by the \nplaintiffs to predominate over the non-common issues [but] the common issues do not have to be \n37  \n \n\n   \nshown to be dispositive.” Bynum I, 214 F.R.D. at 39.  Similarly, the leading commentators on \nthe federal courts have explained that “when one or more of the central issues in the action are \ncommon to the class and can be said to predominate, the action will be considered proper under \nRule 23(b)(3) even though important matters will have to be tried separately.” 7A Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1778 (2d ed. 1986); Gunnells \nIn Bynum I, an overdetention class action case, the Court stated: \nThe Court has already determined the existence of at least one common question \nof fact (whether defendant has detained the class members later than their \nscheduled release date) and at least one common question of law (whether these \nalleged overdetentions violate the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments). A \nresolution of these two questions, which are common to all of the class members’ \nclaims, would dispose of the issue of whether defendant is liable to plaintiffs in \nthis action.  \nBynum I, 214 F.R.D. at 39. \nThe only potential significant individual issue in certifying these claims is damages. This \nCircuit has long held that the mere existence of individual damages issues in a (b)(3) class does \nnot cause individual issues to predominate over common issues on liability or causation so as to \njustify denying certification of the class, when the liability issue is susceptible of class proof.  \nCentral Wesleyan College v. W.R. Grace & Co., 6 F.3d 177 (4th Cir. 1993); Gunnells, 348 F.3d \nat 426.  Other courts recently certifying strip search classes have held the same. Tardiff, 365 F.3d \nat 6; Augustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602; Johnson, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9069 (D.D.C. \n2008), *25 et seq.; and Nassau, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29083 (E.D.N.Y. 2008).   \nThe First, Second and Seventh Circuits have recently gone further and recognized that \nsince most class actions settle, manageability (including predominance issues) issues – which \n38  \n \n\n   \ngenerally do not arise until the damages phase – will in fact never arise at all. As the Seventh \nCircuit stated in Carnegie: \nOften, and possibly in this case as well, there is a big difference from the \nstandpoint of manageability between the liability and remedy phases of a class \naction. The number of class members need have no bearing on the \nburdensomeness of litigating [RICO liability]. Whether particular members of the \nclass were defrauded and if so what their damages were are another matter, and it \nmay be that if and when the defendants are determined to have violated the law \nseparate proceedings of some character will be required to determine the \nentitlements of the individual class members to relief. That prospect need not \ndefeat class treatment of the question whether the defendants violated RICO. \nOnce that question is answered, if it is answered in favor of the class, a global \nsettlement along the lines originally negotiated (though presumably with different \ndollar figures) will be a natural and appropriate sequel. And if there is no \nsettlement, that won't be the end of the world. Rule 23 allows district courts to \ndevise imaginative solutions to problems created by the presence in a class action \nlitigation of individual damages issues. Those solutions include \"(1) bifurcating \nliability and damage trials with the same or different juries; (2) appointing a \nmagistrate judge or special master to preside over individual damages \nproceedings; (3) decertifying the class after the liability trial and providing notice \nto class members concerning how they may proceed to prove damages; (4) \ncreating subclasses; or (5) altering or amending the class. (internal citations \nomitted) \n \nCarnegie v. Household Int’l Finance, Inc., 376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004) (Posner, J.).  \nCertification “as a pretrial joinder device to facilitate group settlements [was] both proper and \ndesirable.”  In re A.H. Robins Co., 880 F.2d 709, 738 (4th Cir. 1989); In re Honda Am. Motor \nCo. Dealership Rels. Litig., 979 F. Supp. 365, 369 n.6 (D. Md. 1997). \nMoreover, in this case, individual damage issues are obviated by Plaintiffs’ proposed \nsampling procedure, described in their Trial Plan.  Alternatively, for each claim, damages could \nbe handled by a damages matrix like the one used in Dellums, 566 F.2d at n.6 and 189.  The \nDellums Court held that common issues predominated on the determination of class damages \nwhere the jury awarded damages on a class wide basis (either for the class as a whole or by \n39  \n \n\n   \nsubclass ) by setting a fixed amount of damages for each class member for each claim according \nto a matrix or schedule.  Id. at 189.  The jury set a matrix of damages for each class member on \nthe detention claims by fixing a set amount for specific periods of detention based on length of \ndetention, and setting a lump sum for each class member on the false arrest and First \nAmendment claims.  Id. at n.6. \nEach class is specifically addressed below. \ni.  Overdetention Class  \nThe Overdetention Class has at least one common question of fact (whether Defendants \nheld the Overdetention Class members more than 48 hours without presentment or release) and \nat least one common question of law (whether these alleged overdetentions violate the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments).  A resolution of these two questions would dispose of the issue of \nwhether Defendants are liable to plaintiffs on this claim.  Plaintiffs can prove the existence of a \npattern of overdetentions using Central Booking’s own computer data in the Automated Booking \nSystem (arrest booking system), which will show every person held more than 48 hours. \nMoreover, the proposed Overdetention Class definition sets a liability floor of 48 hours, \nwhich under Riverside triggers the presumed unreasonability of the detention, and obviates the need \nfor individualized inquiries into the cause of overdetentions in individual cases. The “floor” of the \nclass definition is fixed on a definite, objective criteria – date and time of presentment or release \n– that is easily ascertainable from Central Booking’s computers.  \nAlthough individual damages questions may arise, such individual damages \ndeterminations by themselves do not defeat predominance on the issue of liability on the \noverdetention claim.  Moreover, damages could be handled by a simple damages matrix like the \n40  \n \n\n   \none used in Dellums, 566 F.2d at n.6 and 189, where damages are set according to the length of \noverdetention. \nii.  Suspicionless Strip Search Class  \nThe Suspicionless Strip Search Class has at least one common question of fact (whether \nDefendants subjected persons arrested on minor charges to across the board strip searches), and \nat least one common question of law (whether these alleged strip searches violate the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments).  A resolution of these two questions would dispose of the issue of \nwhether Defendants are liable to Plaintiffs on this claim.  Plaintiffs can prove the existence of a \npattern of subjecting persons arrested on minor charges to across the board strip searches on a \nclass wide basis.  Once that is accomplished, Plaintiffs can use the computer data in the \nAutomated Booking System to identify arrestees arrested on charges not involving weapons, \ndrugs, or felony violence during the period in which arrestees were subjected to blanket strip \nsearches. \nAlthough individual damages questions may arise, such individual damages \ndeterminations by themselves do not defeat predominance on the issue of liability on the \nSuspicionless Arrestee Strip Search claim.  Johnson at *29.  Moreover, Plaintiffs’ proposed \nmethod of using sampling to try damages on a class-wide basis would obviate the need for \nindividualized damages determinations, or, alternatively, for each claim, damages could be \nhandled by a damages matrix like the one used in Dellums, 566 F.2d at 174 n.6 and 189.  On the \nlatter, for instance, damages could be determined on the basis of the arrest charge, and could \nfactor in whether the person was later released without charge.  \n41  \n \n\n   \niii.  Non-Private Strip Search Class  \nThe Non-Private Strip Search Class also has at least one common question of fact \n(whether Defendants subjected men booked into Central Booking to non-private strip searches), \nand at least one common question of law (whether these alleged strip searches violate the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments), the resolution of which would dispose of the issue of whether \ndefendants are liable to plaintiffs on this claim.  As above, damages could be ascertained in \nseparate hearings, or on a class wide basis using sampling or a Dellums style matrix. \niv.  Equal Protection Strip Search Class  \nThe Equal Protection Strip Search Class also has at least one common question of fact \n(whether Defendants subjected men but not women to blanket strip searches at Central Booking), \nand at least one common question of law (whether these alleged strip searches violate the equal \nprotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendments), the resolution of which would dispose of the \nissue of whether Defendants are liable to Plaintiffs on this claim. Damages could be ascertained \nin separate hearings, or on a class wide basis using sampling or a Dellums style matrix. \nv.  Underwear Strip Search Class  \nThe Underwear Strip Search Class also has at least one common question of fact \n(whether Defendants subjected men but not women booked into Central Booking to searches \ndown to their underwear), and at least one common question of law (whether these underwear \nstrip searches violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendments), the resolution \nof which would dispose of the issue of whether defendants are liable to plaintiffs on this claim.  \n42  \n \n\n   \nDamages could be ascertained in separate hearings, or on a class wide basis using sampling or a \nDellums style matrix. \nThis class is proposed as an alternate class, in the event that the factfinder accepts the \nDefendants’ version of facts.  \n \nb)  Class Action Treatment Is Superior and the Case is \nManageable as a Class Action  \n  Rule 23(b)(3) also requires a class action to be the most “fair and efficient” method of \nresolving a claim. See Rule 23(b)(3).  In analyzing that question, courts must consider four \nnonexclusive factors: (1) the interest of the class members in maintaining separate actions; (2) \nthe extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or \nagainst members of the class; (3) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation \nof the claims in the particular forum; and (4) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the \nmanagement of a class action. See Rule 23(b)(3); Tardiff, 365 F.3d at7; Augustin, 2006 U.S. \nApp. LEXIS 21602, 30-31. All of these factors favor class certification for each claim in this \ncase.   \nIn Smith II this Court held that class action treatment of a booking claim similar to \nPlaintiffs’ strip search claims was “far more efficient than individual prosecution of damages \nactions” under Rule 23(b)(3).  573 F. Supp. at 613.  Plaintiffs proposed trial plan sets forth the \nmost efficient method – in fact for most class members the only method -- of resolving the class \nclaims.   Johnson also involves pre-presentment strip searches of arrestees. \nPlaintiffs propose bifurcating the liability trial from damages determination on each \nclaim, and trying liability for all claims in one proceeding.  See In re Honda Am. Motor Co. \n43  \n \n\n   \nDealership Rels. Litig., 979 F. Supp. at 366.  There will be little difficulty in managing a \nclass action on the issue of liability, especially since any individualized inquiries will be \ninconsequential at the liability stage.  At that point, if there is a favorable judgment for Plaintiffs \non at least one claim, the parties can attempt to negotiate a settlement or to negotiate a means of \nresolving damages.  If the parties cannot resolve the damages, damages can be tried on a class \nwide basis for each claim in one proceeding using a damages matrix or sampling. \nAdditionally, the class members have little interest in maintaining separate actions since, \nwithout class notification, most putative class members will not even know that they suffered a \nviolation of their constitutional rights. See, Augustin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 21602, *31-32; \nBlihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D. 607, 622 (W.D.Wis. 2003) (many class members may \nnot even be aware that they have a claim absent certification). \nEven if the parties fail to address damages issues, the Court can still at that point enter a \nclass-wide judgment of liability on the claims, leaving class members to pursue damage claims \nin separate law suits.  Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 7.   \nHowever, determination of damages would be manageable as a class action because \ndamages can be determined by using one of the methods specified by the Carnegie Court, such \nas bifurcating liability and damage trials with the same or different juries, appointing a special \nmaster, or by establishing class-wide damages on an aggregate basis in a single trial using \nstatistical sampling or using a Dellums type damages matrix.  \nThe primary consideration in determining whether a class action is “superior” is the \navailability of other possible ways of handing the case. Realistically, individual damages in these \n44  \n \n\n   \ncases will be inadequate to attract sufficient counsel to represent individuals on a case-by-case \nbasis. Carnegie v. Household Int’l Finance, Inc., 376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004) (“the realistic \nalternative to [this] class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits”). \nClass members and their addresses and other identifying information, including when they were \nsearched and overdetained, are easily identifiable from Central Booking’s Automated Booking \nSystem and other computerized records, including those of jails, courts, and motor vehicle \ndepartments. See Smith IV.  Plaintiffs have obtained Automated Booking System data through \ndiscovery, which contains the last known addresses of all class members.   \nPossible manageability problems will rarely, if ever, by themselves be sufficient to \nprevent certification of a class.  Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241, 1272 (11th Cir. 2004).  \nAnd in this case, the liability issues will not prevent any manageability difficulties, while \ndamages can be resolved using Plaintiffs’ proposed sampling methods or a Dellums style matrix. \n3.  Rule 23 (B)(2)/ (B)(3) “Hybrid” Class:  Each Claim is Appropriate for \nCertification as a “Hybrid” Class \n \nSince there are claims for both injunctive relief and damages, and the requirements for \ncertification are satisfied as to each, the Court may certify Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3) “hybrid” \nclasses. See, e.g., Miller v. Balt. Gas & Elec. Co., 202 F.R.D. 195, 198, 199 (D. Md. 2001), \nciting Eubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d 87, 92 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (permitting a “hybrid” class under \n(b)(2) for liability and (b)(3) for damages); Bratcher v. Nat'l Standard Life Ins. Co. (In re \nMonumental Life Ins. Co.), 365 F.3d 408, 416n. 16 (5th Cir. 2004). Judge Royce Lamberth of \nthe District of Columbia district court recently certified, in two separate orders, two “hybrid” \nclasses addressing virtually the same issues plaintiffs address here.  These classes consisted of \n(1) persons held in the D.C. Jail after the release dates, and (2) defendants subjected to blanket \n45  \n \n\n   \nstrip searches after being ordered released and returned to the D.C. Jail for release processing.  \nBynum v. District of Columbia (Bynum I), 214 F.R.D. 27 (D.D.C. 2003) (“hybrid” overdetention \nclass certified); Bynum v. District of Columbia (Bynum II), 217 F.R.D. 43 (D.D.C. 2003) \n(“hybrid” strip search class certified).  \n \nIII.  TRYING DAMAGES ON A CLASS WIDE BASIS USING STATISTICAL \nSAMPLING14\n \nPlaintiffs submit herewith a trial plan (Exhibit 126) supported by expert statistical and \nmedical testimony for trying damages for all claims in on trial on the basis of a statistically valid \nsample.  Damages awarded the sample can then be extrapolated to the class, and distributed on \nthe basis of a matrix or formula approved by the jury.  See Affidavits of Professor Richard Berk, \nBryan Miller, Dr. Susan Fiester, and Kevin Nichols in support of Plaintiffs’ proposed sampling \nprocedure, Exhibits 96, 97, 124, and 125. The Honorable Royce Lamberth of the District of \nColumbia District Court recently approved a similar plan in Bynum v. District of Columbia, 02-\n956 (RCL)  (Bynum plaintiffs’ proposed trial plan, docket # 98, 9/8/03 attached hereto as \nExhibits 127).15  Many states, including Maryland and the District of Columbia, have statutes \n                                                 \n14  While this issue is being briefed, the Court may certify a class action in full while deferring on \nthe method of determining damages, as has been done in other recent strip search class actions.  \nSee, e.g., In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 2008 U.S. Dist LEXIS 29083 at *20 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2008) (certifying both liability and damages but adding that “the Court has neither \nselected nor foreclosed any particular damages model”); Johnson v. District of Columbia, 2008 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 9069 at *29 (D.D.C. 2008) (“the Court reserves ruling on such [damages] \nmethodology issues for another day but is satisfied that Plaintiffs have satisfied the \npredominance requirement for the purposes of class certification”); Mitchell v. County of \nClinton, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48589 (N.D.N.Y. Jul. 5, 2007) (“the Court has the flexibility to \ndeal with management issues as they arise. At this point, denial of certification regarding \ndamages or other issues is not warranted. The case in its entirety is certified as a class action”). \n15 The case settled before trial.  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 412 F. Supp. 2d 73 (D.D.C. \n2006) (final approval order).  \n46  \n \n\n   \nthat specifically authorize and endorse the use of statistical evidence or proof of amount of \ndamages sustained by the members of the class on a class-wide basis, without requiring proof of \nsuch matters by each individual member of the class.  Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. I §15-\n120(e)(2) and (3); D.C. Code § 28-4508 (District of Columbia direct purchaser antitrust) (amount \nof damages sustained by the members of the class may be proven on a class-wide basis, without \nrequiring proof of such matters by each individual member of the class). \n  Of these methods, establishing class-wide aggregate damages in a single damages trial \nusing a matrix or statistical sampling is the best approach because it achieves economy for all \nparties and the Court without unfairness to any party or absent class member.  In re Chevron \nU.S.A., 109 F.3d 1016, (5th Cir. 1997) (approving the methodology of statistical sampling but \ninvalidating its use on an aggregate basis in that case because the sample was not chosen by \nreliable statistical method); Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493, at 101 (3d ed. 1995); \nMichael J. Saks and Peter David Blanck, Justice Improved: The Unrecognized Benefits Of \nAggregation And Sampling In The Trial Of Mass Tort, 44 Stanford Law Review 815 (1992); \nLaurens Walker and John Mohanan, Sampling Damages, 83 Iowa Law Review 545 (1998); \nLaurens Walker, A Model Plan to Resolve Federal Class Action Cases by Jury Trial, 88 Virginia \nLaw Review 805 (2000). \n  Aggregate trials of non-economic damages in civil rights cases have a long history in \nfederal courts. 3 Newberg 10.5 at 483-487. See, Dellums v Powell, supra (compensatory \ndamages and distribution matrix established by jury based on special verdict upheld for class of \npeople subjected to unlawful arrests and illegal detentions; jury was able to award damages along \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \n47  \n \n\n   \na sliding scale which took into account, in a rough way, the different experiences of class \nmembers without losing administrative feasibility); Hilao v.

Philip Morris, Inc., 133 F. Supp. 2d 162, 169 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2001); In re Simon II Litigation, 211 F.R.D.86, 192-93 (E.D.N.Y. 2002); Bell v. \nFarmers Insurance Exchange, 115 Cal.App.4th 715, 9 Cal.Rptr.3d 544 (2004) (wage case). See  \nA Model Plan To Resolve Federal Class Action Cases By Jury Trial, 88 Va. L. Rev. 405 (2002). \nHere plaintiffs propose first a liability trial, second a trial of the sample’s damages, and third a \ntrial of the whole class’ damages based on testimony about how to extrapolate the sample \ndetermination to the class as a whole (using the same jury). \nSince damages using sampling are determined on a class-wide basis that can be reliably \napplied to the class as a whole, the defendants pay no more to the class than they would in the \naggregate to individuals if the cases of all class members were tried separately. See Allapattah \nServcs. v. Exxonn Corp., 333 F.3d 1248, 1258 (11th Cir. 2003), Exxon Mobil Corp. v. \nAllapattah Servs., 125 S. Ct. 2611 (U.S. 2005).  Defendants are protected because the aggregate \namount could reflect the fact that some class members may have suffered no damages, if that in \nfact were the case.  No un-injured class member, if any, would recover from any fund of \n48  \n \n\n   \naggregate damages without submission of proof of damage because recovery from the fund is \nconditioned on submission of a claim form executed under penalty of perjury. Here, through the \nsubmission of sworn claim forms, equal in dignity to sworn testimony, unaided by expert \ntestimony, plaintiffs satisfy the standards for recovery of compensatory damages applicable to a \nsingle plaintiff civil rights case.  Bogle v. McClure, 332 F.3d 1347, 1358-1359 (11th Cir. 2003) \n(damages of $1,000,000 per plaintiff in civil rights case based on plaintiffs’ testimony affirmed).  \nCONCLUSION \n  For these reasons and others that may be argued at a hearing, the Court should certify the \ncase as a class action, as is routinely done on cases similar to this one. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n_/s/Sean R.

LITT, declare: \n1.  I am a partner in the law firm of Litt, Estuar, Harrison & \nKitson, LLP.  For the seven years before the formation of my current firm, I \nwas the principal in the law firm of Litt & Associates, Inc., in which the \npartners in my current firm were trained.  From September 1, 1991 to May 1, \n1997, when my then partner left the law firm to become Deputy General \nCounsel for Civil Rights at HUD, I was a partner at the firm of Litt & \nMarquez.  For the seven years prior to that, I was a partner in the firm of Litt \n& Stormer, Inc.  The facts set forth herein are within my personal knowledge \nor knowledge gained from review of the pertinent documents. If called upon, \nI could and would testify to those facts in a court of law. \n2.  This declaration is submitted in support of Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Class Certification. \n3.  I am an attorney duly licensed to practice in the State of \nCalifornia and in the Central District of California. I graduated from the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley in 1966, and from UCLA Law School \nin 1969. For the first approximately ten or more years of my practice, I \nfocused primarily in the area of criminal defense at the trial and appellate \nlevels, mostly in the federal courts.  In that capacity, I handled hundreds of \nmatters, tried many cases ranging from immigration offenses to murders, \nand handled numerous appeals. For the past approximately 25 years, I, as \nwell as the firms in which I have been a principal, have focused primarily on \ncomplex civil litigation in the areas of constitutional law, civil rights law, \nclass action litigation, and complex multi-party litigation. \n4.   My current and former firms listed in ¶1 all operated for the \nspecific purpose of developing and maintaining a civil rights and public \n  1\n\ninterest law practice which operates in the private sector on the basis of self-\ngenerated fee awards and other recoveries. Nearly all of the work of my past \nand present firms falls into this category. Litt & Stormer received the Pro \nBono Firm of the Year Award from Public Counsel in 1987 in recognition of \nits public interest and civil rights work. Litt & Marquez received an award \nfrom the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in July, 1992, as civil rights firm of \nthe year in recognition of its civil rights work, primarily for litigation I \nheaded regarding the LAPD’s canine unit. I received an award from UCLA \nSchool of  Law as its public interest alumnus of the year in 1995. I have both \nspoken and written on the subject of civil rights training. I recently published \nan article entitled “Class Certification in Police/ Law Enforcement Cases” in \nCivil Rights Litigation and Attorney’s Fee Annual Handbook, Vol. 18, Ch. 3 \n(West Publishing 2002) and an article in the Los Angeles Lawyer regarding \nthe use of minimum statutory damages under the Unruh Act, particularly \nactions brought under Civil Code §52.1, to enhance the prospects for \ncertifying class actions.

I am rated “av” by Martindale-Hubbell and am listed as a \nSouthern California “SuperLawyer” in the field of civil rights. \n9.  As my case list demonstrates, I have been involved with, and \nsuccessful in, a wide range of complex civil rights cases, including class \nactions such as this, and have the requisite skills and experience to act as \nclass counsel in this case. \n10.  I have been particularly involved in strip search class action \nlitigation, as my case list makes clear. In the Craft v. County of San \nBernardino case cited above, United States District Judge Stephen Larson \nmade the following comments about me in awarding class fund attorney’s \nfees:  \n(cid:190)  “Class counsel are highly experienced and highly regarded civil \nrights lawyers, with extensive class action experience. Mr. Litt is a \nwell known and highly regarded civil rights lawyer specializing in \ncivil rights class actions, especially law enforcement class actions. \nHe has been lead counsel in two other eight figure strip search \n  8\n\nsettlements aside from this one, and is lead counsel in several other \npending strip search class actions in California, Washington D .C., \nMaryland and Georgia. He has several seven figure, and one eight \nfigure, civil rights trial verdicts. With this case, he will have been \nlead counsel in three of the four largest strip search cases, \nmeasured in terms of monetary recovery, in the United States.”  \nCraft v. County of San Bernardino, 2008 WL 916965, 6 (C.D.Cal. \n2008) \n11.  As these comments reflect, I am one of the leading plaintiffs’ \ncounsel in the country in the field at issue in this case – jail strip search \ncases. \n12.  In the course of my work on law enforcement class actions, I \nhave gained considerable experience in organizing cases and making them \nmanageable. From my experience, most law enforcement agencies have \ncomputerized records. Discovery has shown that this is true of the San \nBernardino Sheriff’s Department. These records usually contain a variety of \ninformation including name, address, a unique identifier, personal \nidentifying information (such as Social Security number and driver’s license \nnumber), arrest information, case number, charges, holds, release \ninformation (sometimes direct, sometimes requiring extraction), and other \ndata from which an analysis of a variety of issues is possible. While the \nparticular data and how it is presented varies from one jurisdiction to \nanother, the common factor is databased prisoner and/or arrestee files from \nwhich it has always been possible to make determinations of targeted \nquestions. As it pertains to this case, it has been possible to determine from \nthe jail computer records whether someone was strip searched or, in \njurisdictions that utilized random strip searches, whether they were among \nthe population subjected to random strip searches. To accomplish this, I have \n  9\n\nregularly worked with professors and graduate students at UCLA’s \nDepartment of Statistics who have analyzed the data, put the relevant \ninformation that may come from different databases into a single database, \nand written programs specific to that database for the purposes of generating \nthe required information. In this case, plaintiffs have submitted the \ndeclaration of Richard Berk, formerly a professor of statistics at UCLA now \nat the University of Pennsylvania, whom plaintiffs have retained to perform \nsuch an analysis. Professor Berk initially acted as plaintiffs’ expert in the \nWilliams case against the Los Angeles County Jail and, in conjunction with \nthe settlement, performed such services for all the parties; i.e., plaintiffs’ \ncounsel, defense counsel, and the Class Administrator. Although Professor \nBerk is now at the University of Pennsylvania, I continue to use his services \nas he has extensive experience in this area, and has acted in this capacity in \ncases throughout the country. Although plaintiffs have not yet had the \nopportunity to review the computerized data, it is clear that plaintiffs will be \nable to proceed in this case as in the others, and determine class members \nfrom the defendants’ computer records. \n13.  Once a class list is generated – ideally with the involvement of \nall parties and the court – the class can be notified. Generally, plaintiffs \npropose that class notice occur after a bifurcated liability trial, or after both \nthe liability and damages phases of the trial, depending on the court’s and \nparties’ views. Plaintiffs suggest first a liability trial so that the substantial \nexpense associated with class notice occur only if there is a favorable \nliability determination. In the event plaintiffs are successful on the liability \nissues, either in conjunction with a settlement or not, or before or after the \ndamages phases of the trial, class notice would then be given. The class \nnotice would explain the process adopted by the court, and provide an \nopportunity to opt out. An advantage of this approach is that it saves costs \n  10\n\nand expenses for the parties and the court. If liability is not found, that is the \nend of the process.  If liability is found, that is another opportunity to \ndetermine if the case can settle. If it does not, then the class receives notice. \nThe claims procedure can be combined with the notice, even though there \nmay be no amount involved yet. People filing claims would indicate that \nthey qualify as a class member by making sworn representations under \npenalty of perjury, thereby adding protection that only appropriate class \nmembers are compensated. In this case, I believe that many of the key \nliability issues may be resolved through summary judgment, which plaintiffs \nwill file prior to the hearing on the motion for class certification. \n14.  Once the class list is generated, a random sample of an \nappropriate size, probably around 250-300, would be generated for a \ndamages trial. This is an estimate based on my personal experience. As \nProfessor Berk indicates, it is too early to choose a proper random sample \nsize. It would be difficult, to say the least, to try individual damage \ndeterminations for all class members. Instead, plaintiffs propose that the \nsecond phase of the trial would be to determine damages for the random \nsample. Plaintiffs would retain an integrated team of mental health \nprofessionals to provide opinions on the random sample’s damages through \na combination of surveys, psychological testing and individual interviews. \nThe jury would determine the damages for each member of the random \nsample.  \n15.  The third phase of the trial would be to extrapolate the random \nsample’s damages to the class as a whole. From the random sample award, a \nstatistical analysis will be utilized to determine the mean award, and what \nthe range of awards from the mean would be at difference confidence levels. \nFor example, if the mean award were $5,000 (an arbitrary figure), it can be \ndetermined under standard statistical procedures what the range on each side \n  11\n\nof the mean would be for a 95%, 99% or even 99.99% confidence level. This \ndetermination would depend in part on the sample size, in part on the size of \nthe total population at issue, and in part on the distribution of the random \nsample’s awards. (See Professor Berk’s Declaration.) Hypothetically, the \nrange might be plus or minus $500 for a 95% confidence level, plus or \nminus $650 for a 99% confidence level, and plus or minus $1000 for a \n99.99% confidence level. The confidence level means that, if another \nrandom sample were chosen, there is a certain likelihood that the mean from \nthat determination would be within the plus or minus range of the mean in \nthe initial random sample. A confidence level of 95% means that 19 out of \n20 determinations drawn from a random sample would fall within that range; \na confidence level of 99% means that 99 out of 100 determinations drawn \nfrom a random sample would fall within that range; and a confidence level \nof 99% means that 9,999 out of 10,000 determinations drawn from a random \nsample would fall within that range. The jury would hear testimony on how \nto extrapolate damages to the class as a whole and determine the confidence \nlevel to use, or the court would so determine and instruct the jury.  \n16.  In any event, at whatever confidence level is adopted, the jury \ncan determine the class damages to be awarded. This procedure provides a \nmuch higher level of reliability than individual damage trials since it is well \nknown that re-trials of individual cases can result in substantially different \nverdicts than the first trial.  In fact, in cases where the defense has retained a \nstatistics expert, my experience has been that there is no dispute in principle \nwith the approach or methodology which appear to be universally accepted \namong statisticians, but rather with how to apply it to the particulars of a \ncase. I have not discussed this analysis with Professor Berk, and it is strictly \nmy presentation based on my independent experience addressing statistics \nfor litigation purposes. \n  12\n\n\n\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR MARYLAND \n \nERIC JONES, et al.   \n   \n    Plaintiffs   \n  Civil Action No.  \nv.

This affidavit is in support of plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.   \nTraining and Experience \n3.  I am an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Georgia (admitted to bar \nin 1988) and the District of Columbia (admitted to bar in 1995).  I am admitted pro \nhac vice in this Court.  I am a sole practitioner and maintain offices at 717 D Street, \nNW, Suite 210, Washington, DC 20004-2813, phone 202/824-0700, fax 202/824-\n0745.  My practice focuses on plaintiffs’ class actions. \n4.  In 1984 I received a B.A. in Greek and Latin from St. Louis University, St. \nLouis, Missouri (Phi Beta Kappa).  I graduated magna cum laude from the \nUniversity of Georgia Law School in 1987. \n5.  I clerked for Justice George T. Smith of the Supreme Court of Georgia after \nmy first year of Law School, and I clerked for Justice Albert Rendlen of the \nMissouri Supreme Court after Law School (1987-1988). \n6.  From 1988 to 1990 I was an associate in corporate and international banking \nat Shaw, Pittman in Washington, D.C.  From 1994 I practiced in Taipei, Taiwan in \nthe offices of Ding Mao Song.  The majority of the practice involved representing \nPLAINTIFF 122-001 \n\nTaiwan governmental entities such as Taiwan Power (the island's only utility) and \nDORTS (an agency responsible for constructing and operating a mass transit light \nrail system) in contract disputes with U.S. and European vendors.  The practice \nwas directly relevant to litigation because it involved evaluating claims and \npreparing them for arbitration subject to New York law. \n7.  In 1994/1995 I was an associate at Skadden, Arps in the New York/ Beijing \noffices representing lenders in project finance transactions and representing \nindependent power producers in establishing plants in Mainland China.  The \npractice involved drafting and negotiating documents for the financing of power \nplants.  The practice was directly relevant to complex federal litigation because a \ntypical financing document involved 20-30 parties and 150-160 exhibits.    \n8.  I was on the CJA panel for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia \nfrom 1995 to 2005 where I tried numerous jury trials and I handled numerous \ncriminal cases.  In 1998 I attended a two week trial college at the National \nCriminal Defense College through Mercer Law School in Macon Georgia.  I have \ntried over 35 bench and jury trials over the past 15 years.  In year 2005-2006, the \nCLE classes I have attended include: (1) 41st Annual Deborah T. Creek Criminal \nPractice Institute (CPI) conference District of Columbia Public Defender Service \nall day seminar of criminal defense law, (2) Advanced E-Discovery Institute: \nPractical Concerns, Pragmatic Advice, Emerging Trends 2005, offered by \nGeorgetown Univ.

I also \nrecently attended the Georgetown University Law Center’s 26th Annual Section \n1983: Civil Rights Litigation on April 17-18, 2008. \n9.  Since 1995 I have been in private practice in the District of Columbia \nrepresenting plaintiffs in civil rights and personal injury cases and defendants in \ncriminal cases.  My practice over the last 6-7 years is devoted mainly to complex \nfederal civil rights litigation.   \nAcademic \n10.  I delivered two sections (overdetentions and strip searches) at the Annual \nLitigation Under § 42 U.S.C. 1983 Skills Seminar on December 9, 2005 in Atlanta, \nGeorgia sponsored by the Institute of Continuing Legal Education in Georgia.  \nParticipants who attend the whole seminar received CLE credits and I received \nCLE credits for the written materials I presented. \nPLAINTIFF 122-002 \n\nProfessional Society Memberships \n12.

In 1990 I received a B.S. in Commerce (Finance Concentration) with \nDistinction (Top 10%) from the University of Virginia.  In 1995 I received a J.D. \ncum laude from the School of Law at the State University of New York at \nBuffalo. \n5.  During 1996 I worked for a small private practice with a focus on \npersonal injury litigation.  Since January 1997 I have been a sole practitioner. \nPLAINTIFF 123-001 \n\n6.

DAY \n8505 Baltimore Avenue \nSuite B \nCollege Park, MD  20740 \n301.220.2270 \n \nPLAINTIFF 123-003 \n\n   \n1 DECLARATION OF KEVIN NICHOLS \n  I, KEVIN NICHOLS, declare as follows: \n2\n1.  I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration, except where specified \n3\notherwise.  If called to testify to these facts as a witness in this action, I would so testify. \n4\n2.  I have been retained by Plaintiffs’ counsel to provide results of data that I have analyzed in \n5\nthis case initially, but not exclusively, for the purpose of class certification.   I have been retained to \n6\nprovide my opinion on the following two subjects in the action Eric Jones et al. v. Susan Murphy et al., \n7 Case Number 05-1287 CCB, United States District Court for the District of Maryland involving persons \nbrought to Baltimore’s Central Booking and Intake Facility for presentment to a court commissioner.  \n8\nFirst, the ability of the data to identify arrestees whom have been either over detained or strip searched \n9\nfor current and future data.  Second, to evaluate a methodology to determine damages for the named \n10\nplaintiffs and class members.  I have been informed that there are three defendants in the case:  Susan \n11\nMurphy, William Jednorski and Mitchell Franks, in his individual and official capacity. \n12\n \n13 Qualifications \n \n14\n3.  I am a third year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Los Angeles and have \n15\nearned my Master’s degree in Statistics.  I am trained at the graduate level in data management and data \n16\nanalysis.  My doctoral research entails computational simulation for both social and financial sciences.  I \n17\nam currently working on this case with Dr. Richard Berk, Professor of Criminology and Statistics at the \n18\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and fellow of both the American Association for the Advancement of \n19 Science & the American Statistical Association, and with Dr. Brian Kriegler, Ph.D. in Statistics from the \nUniversity of California, Los Angeles.  Attached hereto is a true and correct copy of my curriculum \n20\nvitae, marked Exhibit A. \n21\n4.  I have worked extensively on numerous class action lawsuits that have required the use of \n22\nstatistical computational programming, numerical analysis, and sampling.  While protective orders \n23\nprohibit me from going into details about these cases, I will describe aspects of some of the cases on \n24\nwhich I have worked that resemble this case. \n25 a.  In Craft v. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department (Case No. 05-359 SGL (OP)(D. \nCal. 2006)), my task (along with Dr. Kriegler) was to analyze and process data maintained \n26\nby the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department (hereafter “SBSD”) necessary to \n27\nDECLARATION OF KEVIN NICHOLS IN SUPPORT OF  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION \nPLAINTIFFS 124-001 \n \n\n   \n1 identify individuals who were subjected to full body cavity searches prior to their \narraignment hearing and/or after being ordered released by the San Bernardino County \n2\nSuperior Court and/or in the presence of other inmates.  To accomplish this task, SBSD \n3\nturned over all data and documentation that Dr. Kriegler and I concluded were necessary to \n4\naddress the issues for which we were retained.  This was then agreed to by the parties with \n5\nparticipation of the court.  It was subject to an agreement that the data be maintained in \n6\nstrict confidence and not be used for any purpose other than the class claims administration \n7 in Craft.  In all, Craft involved analysis of approximately 380,000 bookings, of which over \n265,000 bookings qualified approximately 155,000 unique individuals for membership in \n8\nthe class.  My understanding is that the settlement of this case is currently being finalized.   \n9\nb.  Fairfield v. Advantage Rent-a-Car (Case No. BC342461) was a “wage and hour” case in \n10\nwhich my tasks were threefold.  First, I recommended a procedure by which hourly \n11\nemployee data should be sampled so that conclusions about the population of hourly \n12\nemployees could be drawn within a reasonably small margin of error.  Second, upon \n13 receiving the data from Advantage Rent-a-Car, I imported and wrote computational code so \nthat the data were in a format that could be analyzed.  Third, I analyzed this sample of data \n14\nfor the purposes of computing both missed meal breaks and uncompensated overtime hours \n15\nof work, then I made projections to the population of class members.  All of this work was \n16\nsubject to an agreement that the data be maintained in strict confidence and not be used for \n17\nany purpose other than the class claims administration in Fairfield.  I analyzed clock in/out \n18\n(i.e., time card) data for approximately 150 employees and 3,500 employee workdays. My \n19 understanding is that the settlement of this case is currently being finalized. \nc.  Barnes v. District of Columbia (Case no. 06-315 RCL) is a class action law suit against the \n20\nDistrict of Columbia for detaining individuals past their expected date of release and/or \n21\nsubjecting them to full body cavity searches after being ordered to be released by a \n22\nSuperior Court judge.  Just as in Craft, the DC Department of Corrections turned over all \n23\ndata and documentation that I concluded were necessary to address the issues for which I \n24\nwas retained.  Their database consisted of approximately 43,000 bookings during the class \n25 period.  Roughly 12,000 bookings have been identified as individuals for possible \nmembership in the class.  To help determine the class size and individual class \n26\nmembership, I have designed a sampling procedure for examining a subset of possible class \n27\nDECLARATION OF KEVIN NICHOLS IN SUPPORT OF  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION \nPLAINTIFFS 124-002 \n \n\n   \n1 members’ hard copy documents based on the results of individuals’ data (e.g., booking \ndata, charges data, location history, etc.) located on the DC jail’s computer database \n2\nsystem.  I am still actively working on this case.   \n3\nd.  Gamino v. County of Ventura(Case no. CV-02-9785 CBM (Ex)) is a class action against \n4\nVentura County for subjecting individuals to full body cavity searches after being arrested \n5\non a charge of driving under the influence.  The Sheriff’s Department turned over data and \n6\ndocumentation that I concluded were necessary to address the issues for which I was \n7 retained.  The data consisted of 41,000 bookings during the class period.  Of those 41,000 \nbookings, approximately 3,500 individuals have been identified for the class.  I am still \n8\nactively working on this case.  This case is in mediation and is expected to settle. \n9\n5.  For each of these cases, I have had (or am still having) discussions with each respective \n10\nopposing counsel’s technical experts to ensure that there was (is) minimal burden placed on those \n11\nresponsible for producing the data. \n12\n6.  For all of these cases I have used the highly reputable statistical software program SAS for \n13 all analysis.  I am also trained to use Microsoft Office tools.  I have taken graduate courses in data \nmanagement and SAS programming. \n14\n \n15\nKnowledge in this Case \n16\n   \n17\n7.  I have read the document “BC Treatment Plan,” as provided by the Plaintiffs Counsel.  \n18\nThis plan details the protocol for an arrest made in Baltimore County and the timetable for a booking \n19 cycle.  A true and correct copy of the “BC Treatment Plan,” was filed as Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 95. \n8.  I have read the declarations of Richard A. Berk(Exhibit 96) and Susan J. Fiester(Exhibit \n20\n125) in support of the Plaintiffs’ counsel to provide an opinion on a methodology to determine damages \n21\nfor named plaintiffs and class members on a class-wide basis in this action.  \n22\n9.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has also instructed me to consider the gender of the arrestee, and the \n23\nwarden in tenure, at the time of arrest.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has informed me to assume that these are the \n24\ndates that the wardens were in tenure: \n25 a.  William Jednorski (May 12th, 2002 – March 8th, 2004 \nb.  Susan Murphy (March 9th, 2004 – June 22nd, 2005) \n26\nc.  Howard Ray (June 23rd, 2005 – July 5th, 2005) \n27\nDECLARATION OF KEVIN NICHOLS IN SUPPORT OF  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION \nPLAINTIFFS 124-003 \n \n\n   \n1 d.  Mitchell Franks (July 6th, 2005 – End of class period) \n10.  I have worked intensively with numerous electronic files provided to us by the City of \n2\nBaltimore.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has informed me that at the outset, there is one database of critical \n3\nimportance to this case.  That database comes from the Central Booking and Intake Center’s Automated \n4\nBooking System (henceforth referred to as the “ABS data”).  After several conversations with opposing \n5\ncounsel’s technical experts on the best way to format and transport the data, we received CD-ROMs \n6\nwith the ABS data from the county of Baltimore.  The data consists of bookings with arrest dates during \n7 the period of May 2002 through August 2007.  After discussions with Plaintiffs’ counsel and with \nDefendants’ counsel and their technical experts, I was provided with ABS data in the form of six \n8\nelectronic data files (“queries”).   \n9\n11.  Each query is part of a relational database by Central Booking Facility number (henceforth \n10\nknown as “CBF number”).  That is, the CBF number is found in all six queries and can be used to link \n11\ninformation from one query to information on the same booking found in another query.  Thus far for \n12\nanalysis only information from Queries 1, 2 and 6 have been necessary to identifying possible over-\n13 detentions.  Some key pieces of information found in each query are as follows:  Query 1 contains \nbiographical information, arrest information, transport information, booking information, offense \n14\ninformation, court commissioner hearing information and release information.  Specific fields from \n15\nQuery 1 provide the following pieces of information that I have used for analysis: the recorded arrest \n16\ndate and time, the recorded release date and time, whether or not that individual was a police release and \n17\nthe recorded date and time in which an inmate was heard by a court commissioner.  Query 2 contains \n18\nprimarily charge information.  Charge information will be used to determine charge severity.  Query 6 \n19 contains location history information.  Query 6 is used to determine the first time that an inmate is \nscanned into the system, the last time an inmate moves during the booking cycle and whether or not that \n20\ninmate was ever in room for a court commissioner hearing.  Queries 3, 4 and 5 have not been used in the \n21\nover-detention analysis of the data.  Query 3 contains a description of the incident for each booking \n22\ncycle.  Query 4 contains information on the arresting officer as well as other affiliates to the arrestee for \n23\nthe booking cycle.  Query 5 contains a list of personal possessions found on the arrestee. \n24\n12.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has instructed me to identify three classes of people: \n25 a.  All individuals who were booked and presented to a court commissioner more than 48 \nhours after the time of arrest.  From henceforth these people will be known as \n26\n“presentments.” \n27\nDECLARATION OF KEVIN NICHOLS IN SUPPORT OF  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION \nPLAINTIFFS 124-004 \n \n\n   \n1 b.  All individuals who were booked and released by the Police more than 48 hours after the \ntime of arrest without charges.  From henceforth these people will be known as “Released \n2\nwithout charge” or “RWOCs” for short.   \n3\nc.  All individuals who were neither released nor presented to a court commissioner.  \n4\nPlaintiffs’ counsel has undergone further investigation and informed me that it appears \n5\nthese people were already in jail and were brought to ABS to be processed on a different \n6\nwarrant or for an offense allegedly committed while in jail.  From henceforth these will be \n7 known as “jail detainees.” \n13.  While there are no fields that directly indicates a strip search, if provided parameters I can \n8\ndevelop logical queries to identify class members based on the date/time of booking, gender, arrest \n9\ncharges, search officer, and other parameters. \n10\n \n11\nExamination of Data & Assumptions for Analysis \n12\n \n13 14.  For all analyses, Plaintiffs’ counsel has asked me to assume that each booking cycle begins \nwith the arrest date and time.  Should the arrest date/time information be unavailable for a given \n14\nbooking, then the first documented movement while in custody shall be considered the beginning of \n15\ndetainment for that individual. \n16\n15.  I computed presentment detention as the difference between the court commissioner \n17\nhearing (henceforth “CC hearing”) and the date/time of arrest. For all bookings found in both the \n18\nbooking informational query (Query 1) and the location history query (Query 6) there is 100% \n19 correlation between the CC hearing field found in Query 1 and the first time that an arrestee visits one of \nthe following court commissioner rooms in Query 6: 2N10, 2N14, 2N15, 2N16, 2N17, 2N18,2N25.  \n20\nThis means that the first time an arrestee is scanned in at one of the court commissioner rooms is the \n21\nsame exact time that is found for their CC hearing field in the booking query.  Thus, calculating \n22\ndetention for a “presentment” by subtracting the date/time of arrest from the CC hearing is congruent to \n23\ncalculating the difference between a person’s time of arrest and the first time that person enters one of \n24\nthe above listed court commissioner rooms.  From henceforth this will be known as method 1 for \n25 calculating “presentment” detention length. \n16.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has asked me to search for instances in which a “presentment,” visits a \n26\ncourt commissioner room multiple times during a booking cycle.  Of the 236,401 “presentments” 13,377 \n27\nDECLARATION OF KEVIN NICHOLS IN SUPPORT OF  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION \nPLAINTIFFS 124-005 \n \n\n   \n1 of them have multiple trips to a court commissioner room.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has asked me to calculate \nthe length of detention in an alternate way for these people.  Instead of calculating detention as the first \n2\ntime a person enters a court commissioner room minus time of arrest, detention will instead be \n3\ncalculated as the last time a person enters a court commissioner room minus the time of arrest.  Except \n4\nfor in the case of “presentments” who have visited room 2N25.  I have been informed that room 2N25 is \n5\nalso used for pre-trial so “presentments” with multiple trips to 2N25 may have reasons for additional \n6\nvisits other than a court commissioner hearing.  The first visit to room 2N25 will be considered the end \n7 of the term of detainment.  Again, using this alternative method for calculating detainment will not make \na difference for most “presentments” as they only enter a court commissioner room once, but \n8\nnonetheless the resulting number of over-detentions for the class is still affected significantly using this \n9\nalternative method of detention calculation.  From henceforth this will be known as method 2 for \n10\ncalculating “presentment” detention length.      \n11\n17.  There were some instances (3,098) in the ABS data in which a booking number existed in \n12\nthe location history query (Query 6) but did not exist in the booking informational query (Query 1) and \n13 the location history indicated that the arrestee had visited a court commissioner hearing room.  Without \nbooking or arrest information we had to use an alternative method to calculate the length of detainment \n14\nfor these individuals.  The length of detainment is again calculated in one of following two ways: \n15\na.  Parallel to method 1 for calculating presentment length, these 3,098 bookings will have the \n16\nend of their detention length considered to be the first time they enter one of the court \n17\ncommissioner rooms.  Without an arrest date, the beginning of their detainment will simply \n18\nbe the date/time of the first movement while in custody found in the location history query \n19 (Query 6).  Detainment for these 3,098 bookings calculated this way will be included with \nthe method 1 version of the results.   \n20\nb.  Congruent with method 2 for calculating presentment length, these 3,098 will have their \n21\nlast date/time they enter a court commissioner room (unless its room 2N25, in which case \n22\nthe date/time of the first visit is still used) used as the end of their detainment.  The \n23\nbeginning of their detainment will again be the first date/time of movement under custody \n24\nfound in Query 6.  Detainment for these 3,098 bookings calculated this way will be \n25 included with the method 2 version of the results.   \n \n26\n27\nDECLARATION OF KEVIN NICHOLS IN SUPPORT OF  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION \nPLAINTIFFS 124-006 \n \n\n   \n1 18.  If a booking did not have a CC hearing or any electronic evidence of ever visiting a court \ncommissioner room, I considered this booking not to be a presentment. If according to the data, an \n2\nindividual was released with out having been presented to a court commissioner but s/he was a “police \n3\nrelease,” then this booking was classified as a “RWOC.” If the release time is recorded then detention is \n4\ncomputed as the difference between the release date/time and the arrest date/time. If the release \n5\ndate/time is not available in the ABS data, then detention is computed as the difference between the last \n6\nknown date/time of movement while in custody minus the date/time of arrest. \n7 19.  I considered individuals who, according to the electronic data, did not visit a court \ncommissioner after their arrest and were not indicated as being released without charge.  There are \n8\n145,407 such bookings.  89,314 of these bookings had a booking type that was not “Warrant.”  19,334 \n9\nof them visited a pre-commissioner hearing waiting room (2N01, 2N04, 2N06).  Plaintiffs counsel has \n10\ninformed me that further discovery is required before these bookings can be accurately classified and a \n11\nmethodology for calculating detention can be developed.  These bookings for now have been classified \n12\nas “other.” \n13 Results \n \n14\n20.  Table 1 shows all bookings for the class period(up to the point that we have data) dissected \n15\nin the following way:   \n16\na.  Bookings were first classified as “presentments”, “RWOCs” or “other” \n17\nb.  Bookings were then further classified by warden in tenure based on their arrest date. \n18\nc.  “Presentments” and “RWOCs” had their detainment length calculated as was specified in \n19 paragraphs 15, 17 and 18.  Method 1 for calculating presentment detention was used. \nd.  All bookings were then further classified by the length of their detainment.  Inmates with \n20\nmore than 48 hours of detainment were flagged as over-detained. \n21\ne.  “Presentments” and “RWOCs” were classified by gender.  \n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\nDECLARATION OF KEVIN NICHOLS IN SUPPORT OF  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION \nPLAINTIFFS 124-007 \n \n\n   \n1  \n21.

In Exhibit 96, Dr. Berk recognizes random probability sampling as a scientifically valid \n3\nway of using a sample to learn about a population.  Given a random probability sample it is possible to \n4\nextrapolate the results of that sample to the population with some margin of statistically random error. \n5\n23.  In Exhibit 125, Dr. Fiester declares that for this class, the results of a psychological \n6\nanalysis on a random probability sample of the entire class can be extrapolated to the entire class. \n7 24.  Given the resulting data from a psychological analysis for a random probability sample of \nthis class I am capable of statistically projecting class wide results with some margin of statistically \n8\nrandom error as a means for assessing damages on a class wide basis. \n9\n   \n10\nConclusions \n11\n \n12\n25.  With the availability of ABS data it is both feasible and efficient to determine a list of \n13 potential class members using logic outlined in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17.  Furthermore, should a \nrandom probability sample be taken of the entire class and then subjected to a psychological analysis, it \n14\nis also a relatively simple and efficient process to extrapolate the results of this analysis to the entire \n15\nclass. \n16\n \n17\n \n18\n \n19  \nI declare the foregoing to be true under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United States.

CCB 05 CV 1287 \n \nSUSAN MURPHY, et al. \n \n    Defendants \n  \nPLAINTIFFS’ PROPOSED TRIAL PLAN \n \n  The Plaintiffs, by and through undersigned counsel, submit this Trial Plan \nin support of their motion for class certification.    \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nThis is a §1983 class action case alleging the overdetention of arrestees in \nBaltimore Central Booking and Intake Center (“Overdetention Claim”), blanket \nstrip searching of arrestees pursuant to their booking to Central Booking (“Strip \nSearch Claims”), strip searching of men but not women (“Equal Protection \nClaim”), strip searching of men in non-private seetings (“Non-Private Strip Search \nClaim”), and searching men, but not women, to their underwear (“Underwear \nSearch Claim”).  The Overdetention Claim covers cases where an arrestee was \noverdetained without presentment (and released) as well as cases where the \narrestee was overdetained and presented.  \nII.   PURPOSE OF PROPOSED TRIAL PLAN \n  Plaintiffs hereby present this proposed trial plan, which explains Plaintiffs’ \nplanned approach to discovery, class notice, and trial.  This Proposed Trial Plan is \nPLAINTI FF 126-1 \n\n   \nmeant to aid the Court in determining effective discovery management, the \ndevelopment of notice procedures, and management of the trial of the case.  The \nProposed Trial Plan is not necessarily meant to be final in the matters of \nwitnesses or exhibits; expert reports; proposing jury instructions and special \nverdict forms, or even adopting a particular methodology of determining damages \nfor class members.  Moreover, the determination of a trial plan will depend on the \nCourt’s decisions regarding the most efficient and reasonable method for \nproceeding to trial.  On this basis, Plaintiffs reserve the right to present a revised \nand more detailed trial plan once discovery is complete and the trial date nears.      \nIII.  BIFURCATION OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES PHASES \n  Plaintiffs propose that the trial, and initially discovery, be bifurcated into (1) \na liability phase (including determination of injunctive relief) and (2) a damages \nphase.  Rule 42(b).  The parties have thus far been proceeding on an informal, \ncooperative discovery process on liability and class action issues.   \n  Bifurcation of civil rights class actions into a liability phase and a damages \nphase is widely recognized and accepted.  See, e.g., Gunnells v. Healthplan \nServs., 348 F.3d 417, 425 (4th Cir. 2003); Shetterly v. Raymark Indus., 117 F.3d \n776, 782 (4th Cir. 1997) (district court has discretion to bifurcate the trial to \nensure case is tried in an orderly fashion); Miller v. Balt. Gas & Elec. Co., 202 \nF.R.D. 195, 199 (D. Md. 2001); Neal v. Director of Department of Corrections, \n1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11543 (D.D.C. 1995) (Memorandum Opinion IV) \n(Procedures for Absent Class Members) rev’d on other grounds sub nominee, \nBonds v. District of Columbia, 93 F. 3d 801 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Rule 42(b) permits \nPLAINTI FF 126-2 \n\n   \ntrial of individual, discrete issues.  As long as separate juries do not re-examine \npreviously resolved fact determinations, bifurcation does not violate the Seventh \nAmendment.  Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 267 F.3d 147, 170 (2d \nCir.  2001); Olden v. Lafarge Corp., 383 f.3d 495, 509 (6th cir. 2004) (affirming \nRule 23(b)(3)/23(c)(4)(a) certification of liability issues in a toxic pollutants \nexposure case noting that if done properly, bifurcation will not raise any seventh \namendment “re-examination” issues). \n  The central issues to be determined in the liability phase are, on the \noverdetention claim: (1) whether Central Booking has a pattern and practice that \nled to arrestees being detained for more than 48 hours before release or \npresentment; (2) whether the practice violates the constitutional rights of \narrestees; (3)  whether defendant Wardens are liable directly (by having \nconstructive notice of each and every overdetention, and failing to act), on the \nbasis of supervisory liability or acquiescence, or some other theory. \n  On the strip search claims, the issues to be determined at the liability stage \nare:  (1) whether Central Booking has a practice/policy of subjecting arrestees to \nblanket booking strip searches (a) without individualized suspicion, (b) in non-\nprivate setting, or (c) on the basis of gender; (2) whether the practice/policy \nviolates the constitutional rights of arrestees; whether subjecting males but not \nfemales to underwear searches violates the Equal Protection Class; and (4) \nwhether defendant Wardens are liable on the basis of supervisory liability or \nacquiescence. \nPLAINTI FF 126-3 \n\n   \n  The Plaintiffs are currently endeavoring to obtain some clarity on one issue \nin particular, that is, whether the facts alleged by the Defendants, i.e., that prior \nto January 1, 2006, the Defendants employed a practice of searching men, but \nnot women, to their underwear.  Some additional liability issues may be \nappropriate for summary judgment as the discovery process unfolds.  This far, \nthe focus of discovery has been on line staff and lower-level supervisors.  Another \nissue that may need a motion for summary judgment to be clarified is, in the case \nof persons who are presented to a commissioner, is whether the period of \noverdetention should be measured from the time of presentment to the \ncommissioner, or the time at which theperson is actually released from Central \nBooking.  At some times during the class period post presentment release often \ntook up to 8 hours. \n   At the trial stage, liability and damages can be bifurcated as well, as \ndiscussed below.   \nIV.     NOTICE PROCEDURES   \n  Notice to class members is not required at Phase I for any class because the \nissue of liability falls under Rule 23(b)(2).  Class actions seeking declaratory or \ninjunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2) are not subject to the individual notice \nrequirements of Rule 23(c)(2).  Stolz v. United Broth. of Carpenters and Joiners of \nAmerica, 620 F. Supp. 396 (D. Nev. 1985).  Moreover, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \nclass notice can be deferred umtil after a resolution of all liability issues. \n  Notice is required for Phase II because damages are integral to a Rule \n23(b)(3) class.  Moreover, notice in the case addresses any due process objections \nPLAINTI FF 126-4 \n\n   \nclass members might have to a class-wide determination of damages.  Objecting \nclass members would be allowed to opt out of the class in favor of an individual \njury trial on damages.  The Court can determine the content of the notice after it \nrules on the methodology of proving damages.  \n  Plaintiffs will submit their proposal for notification procedures if the Court \ncertifies any of the claims or issues.  However, at this point the Plaintiffs note that \nthe Defendants have provided the Plaintiffs with data from the Automated \nBooking System that the Defendants represent contains information as to each \nperson arrested and taken to Central Booking during the class period, including \ntheir address at the time of their arrest.  Furthermore, issues involving Central \nBooking have in the past generated widespread media interest. \nV.   PHASE I – TRIAL OF LIABILITY \n  Determination of liability.  Determination of liability can be made either by \ntrial or by motion for summary judgment.  The issue of the constitutionality of the \nDefendants’ written policy of subjecting every male booked into Central Booking \nduring the class period to an underwear strip search based on gender is at the \nwriting pending before the Court. \n  Whether Central Booking had a practice or written policy of subjecting \npersons booked into Central Booking during the class period to bare skin1 strip \nsearches (a) without individualized, reasonable suspicion, (b) of men not in \nprivate, and/or (c) on the basis of gender, might also be established through a \n                                                 \n1   That is, where the underwear are removed or pulled down to expose the genital \nand/or anal area(s). \nPLAINTI FF 126-5 \n\n   \nmotion for summary judgment depending on the results of discovery.  The \nexistence of such policies and practices, however, could be determined at trial if \nnot by summary judgment.  Discovery results thus far suggest that the existence \nof a practice of bare skin strip searches for males and females, will not be in \ndispute; the only issue will be, when did they stop? \n For overdetentions, Plaintiffs expect to be able to use the Defendants’ \ncomputer databases and admissions related to those databases to determine who \nwas overdetained and for how long, as explained in Kevin Nichols’ affidavit \nPlaintiffs’ Exhibit # 124.  \n  Methods of proof.  Plaintiffs will prove Central Booking’s liability (i.e., the \nexistence of policies and practices) with evidence based upon declarations of \narrestees, statistical sampling, analysis of Central Booking’s own computer \nrecords, deposition testimony of Central Booking employees, and witness \ntestimony (including arrestees taken to Central Booking during various periods of \ntime).  \n  The use of statistical evidence to prove liability in civil rights cases is well \nestablished.  Berger v. Iron Workers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d \n1395, 1413 (D.C. 1998); Davis v. Califano, 613 F.2d 957 (D.C. Cir. 1979) \n(“statistical proof may alone be used, without presentation of specific instances of \ndiscrimination, to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination”); \nMitchell v. Diamond Cab Company of District of Columbia, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n12492, *25 (D.D.C. 2003) (motion for summary judgment) (collecting cases).  \nPLAINTI FF 126-6 \n\n   \nScholars, courts and even legislatures have recognized that, in many cases, \nstatistical methods actually provide a more accurate form of evidence than \nindividual testimony.   \n  Many categories of federal cases routinely use statistical methods to \ndetermine liability and damages.  See, e.g., Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, \n97 S. Ct. 1272, 51 L. Ed. 2d 498 (1977) (statistical data to prove discrimination in \njury selection); Menard-Sanford v. Mabey (In re A.H. Robins Co.), 880 F.2d 694 \n(4th Cir. 1989) (Dalkon Shield litigation); Berger (employment discrimination); \nZippo Manufacturing Co. v. Rogers Imports, Inc., 216 F. Supp. 670 (S.D.N.Y. \n1963) (Feinberg, J.) (survey data in trademark infringement case); Cimino v. \nRaymark Indus., 751 F. Supp. 649, 659 (E.D. Tex. 1990) (discussing statistics \nand its applications in federal cases) rev’d, Cimino v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 151 \nF.3d 297 (5th Cir. 1998).  Courts frequently permit evidence of life-expectancy or \nmortality tables when determining damages.  See Ageloff v. Delta Airlines, Inc., \n860 F.2d 379 (11th Cir. 1988); Asana v. United States, 616 F.2d 41 (2nd Cir. \n1980); Larsen v. International Business Machines Corp., 87 F.R.D. 602 (E.D.Pa. \n1980) (use of work-life tables); see also Bell v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, 115 \nCal.App.4th 715, 9 Cal.Rptr.3d 544 (2004) (relying heavily on federal law in \nupholding the use of statistics to formulate damages and provides a thorough and \ndetailed discussion of the use of statistics to determine damages in the wage and \nhour context).  \nDiscovery.  Database discovery of Central Booking and Baltimore City \nPolice Department computers has been provided and will need to be updated.  \nPLAINTI FF 126-7 \n\n   \nThe parties have thus far engaged in informal, targeted, cooperative discovery \nfocusing on the search practices, policies, and justifications.  Plaintiffs have \ndeposed numerous line officers and have started on supervisor depositions from \nthe bottom up.  That will need to continue on up to the Wardens. \nAt this point, Defendants have no need to depose absent class members for \nthe liability phase of the trial beyond those who will be on Plaintiffs’ witness list.  \nDellums v Powell, 566 F.2d 167, 187 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (defendant has no absolute \nright to take discovery from absent class members).  Nor would Defendants need \nto take damages discovery from any plaintiffs at this point. \nCosts and Attorneys' Fees.  Plaintiffs will be entitled to an award of costs \nand reasonable attorneys’ fees for work expended to this date in this litigation \nshould plaintiffs’ prevail at this Phase.  Neal v. Director of Department of \nCorrections, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11543 at *14. \nVI.   IMPLEMENTATION OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n   Plaintiffs believe that the claims for injunctive relief can be settled by \nagreement between the parties without the need for a court order or on-going \ncourt supervision.  However, should the parties be unable to resolve this claim, \nPlaintiffs will request an injunction ordering that: \n(cid:190)  The State Defendants must maintain a written log of all strip searches of \narrestees, showing the name of the arrestee, the charge, the date and time \nof search, the person conducting the strip search, the reason(s) therefore, \nthe person’s gender, and other persons present during the search. \nPLAINTI FF 126-8 \n\n   \n(cid:190)  Requiring that all strip searches to be approved by a supervisory officer. \n(cid:190)  Thorough strip search training of all officers. \n(cid:190)  Each month, the State Defendants file with the Court , and provide to \nplaintiffs’ counsel a copy of the log; \n(cid:190)  Attorney’s fees and costs for the injunctive phase be awarded, as well as \nmonitoring fees for the foregoing. \nVII.  PHASE II – DETERMINING COMPENSATORY DAMAGES \n  If plaintiffs prevail on liability, the issue of damages may well settle.  The \nCourt may even order “bellwether” damages trials of a representative sample, \nwhich the parties can then use to assess the values of all claims and possibly \nsettle the case.  In re Chevron U.S.A, 109 F.3d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir. 1997) (“The \nnotion that the trial of some members of a large group of claimants may provide a \nbasis for enhancing prospects of settlement or for resolving common issues or \nclaims is a sound one that has achieved general acceptance by both bench and \nbar”).   \n  If the case does not settle, Phase II of the trial would address classwide \ndamages.  The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals approved the use of a “damages \nmatrix” specifically stated in a mass arrest/ overdetention class action that \nassigned set amounts of damages to class members by allocating damages \naccording to categories of overdetention times, e.g., x dollars for all persons \noverdetained between 12-24 hours, y dollars to all persons overdetained between \n24-36 hours, etc.  Dellums v Powell, 566 F.2d at 189 (“Nor do we think that \nPLAINTI FF 126-9 \n\n   \ndetermination of damages in this case requires individualization.” ).  Therefore, \nalong with other methods of determining damages, plaintiffs propose two methods \nof determining damages on a class-wide basis.    \nA.   Methodologies of Determining Compensatory Damages  \n  There are five basic methodologies of determining damages in class actions \nsuch as this: (1) by asking the jury to establish a matrix for damages based on \nsuch factors as length of detention, type of strip search, and/or arrest charge \nwithout statistical sampling; (2) in a single, class-wide damages trial using \n“sampling;” (3) by mini-trials tried to judges (or, if Defendants agree, magistrate \njudges, or even special masters) on the issue of damages; (4) using “bell whether” \ntrials of a sample of plaintiffs; or (5) by a claims procedure agreed upon by the \nparties.    \n  Plaintiffs propose determining damages (1) by asking the jury to establish a \nmatrix for damages for the entire class using the method approved by the Court \nof Appeals in Dellums; or, alternatively, (2) in a single, class-wide damages trial \nusing \"sampling;” (3) by mini-trials tried to judges (or magistrates if defendants \nagree) on the issue of damages; or, alternatively, (4) by a claims procedure agreed \nupon by the parties.   \n  The plaintiffs in Dellums v. Powell, whose claims included a claim for \ndamages arising from mass arrest and overdetention, submitted a damages \nquestion to the jury that allowed the jury to assign a schedule of damages based \non length of detention that was then to be applied to the plaintiffs on a ministerial \nPLAINTI FF 126-10 \n\n   \nbasis.  566 F.2d at 208.  Working with the Form of Verdict designed by the \ndistrict court, the jury was able to award damages along a sliding scale which \ntook into account, in a rough way, the different experiences of different members \nof the class, without losing administrative feasibility.  Id.  This is the simplest \nmethod of determining damages on a class-wide basis. \n  Alternatively, Plaintiffs propose using the second method, a single trial \nusing \"sampling” to try class-wide damages on an aggregate basis to a jury, as the \nbest approach.  The use of acceptable sampling techniques, in lieu of discovery \nand the presentation of voluminous data from the entire class, will produce \nsubstantial savings in time and expense.  For many class members, sampling \n(or damages matrix methods) techniques may provide the only practicable \nmeans to obtain recovery.  See Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493, at 101 \n(3d ed. 1995).  The Fourth Circuit used sampling techniques extensively in the \nDalkon Shield Litigation.  See, e.g., Menard-Sanford v. Mabey (In re A.H. Robins \nCo.), 880 F.2d 694 (4th Cir. 1989).   For a discussion of the Fourth Circuit’s \nextensive use of sampling in the Dalkon Shield Litigation, see Laurens Walker, \nEssay: A Model Plan To Resolve Federal Class Action Cases By Jury Trial, 88 Va. \nL. Rev. 405, 419 (2002). ).2  Many states, including Maryland and the District of \nColumbia, have statutes that specifically authorize and endorse the use of statistical \nevidence or proof of amount of damages sustained by the members of the class on a class-wide \n                                                 \n2 The case settled before trial.  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 412 F. Supp. 2d 73 (D.D.C. 2006) \n(final approval order).  \n \nPLAINTI FF 126-11 \n\n   \nbasis, without requiring proof of such matters by each individual member of the class.  Md. Code \nAnn., Health-Gen. I §15-120(e)(2) and (3); D.C. Code § 28-4508 (District of Columbia \ndirect purchaser antitrust) (amount of damages sustained by the members of the class may be \nproven on a class-wide basis, without requiring proof of such matters by each individual member of \nthe class). \n    \nB. Trial Of Class-Wide Damages Using  “Sampling” \n1.   Aggregate trial \n  Aggregate trials of non-economic damages in civil rights cases are well \nestablished.  Dellums v Powell, 566 F.2d 176, 189 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  In Dellums, \nthe Court of Appeals upheld a jury’s award of a lump sum of compensatory \ndamages, and a distribution matrix of damages for unlawful arrests and illegal \ndetentions based on the arrests.  Id.  The jury in Dellums decided on a lump sum \nfor a class of protestors arrested without probable cause and illegally detained for \nvarying periods.  It then set a schedule according to which damages were \nassigned to subclasses based upon length of illegal incarceration.  The court then \nassigned class members to a subclass based upon the detention records of the \ngovernment.  Id.  The Dellums Court specifically stated, “Nor do we think that \ndetermination of damages in this case requires individualization.”  Id.   \n  There is a growing trend in favor of using aggregate damage trials.  3 \nNewberg on Class Actions §10.5 at 483-487 (4th ed. 2002); Long v. Trans World \nAirlines, Inc., 761 F. Supp. 1320, 1326 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (court limits discovery to \nPLAINTI FF 126-12 \n\n   \nmembers of a sample of the class and rules plaintiffs can try a class-wide amount \nfor damages including intangible injuries such as pain and suffering to a jury \nusing sampling); Blue Cross & Blue Shield of N.J., Inc. v.

Supp. 2d 162, 169 (E.D.N.Y. 2001); In re Simon II Litig., 211 F.R.D. 86, 147 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2002), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 407 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. \n2005); Christopher J.

Code of Md., \nHealth-Gen. §15-120(e)(2) (authorizing use of statistical sampling for tobacco \nlitigation). \n2. Sampling In General \n  Sampling involves randomly selecting a fraction of class members, trying \nthe damages of each plaintiff in the sample to a jury, extrapolating from the \ndamages of the class to a lump sum for the class, and then distributing the \ndamages among class members according to a formula, or matrix, or point \nsystem determined by the jury, or by the Court.  Michael J. Saks & Peter David \nBlanck, Justice Improved: The Unrecognized Benefits of Aggregation and \nSampling in the Trial of Mass Torts, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 815 (1992); 3 Newberg on \nClass Actions § 10.5 at 483-487.  Courts have employed various distribution \nprocedures to allocate class awards to class members, some of which are \ndiscussed below. \nPLAINTI FF 126-13 \n\n   \n  The most influential case in which tort damages were determined in a lump \nsum for the entire class in a rule 23(b)(3) class action is Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, \n103 F.3d 767, 782 (9th Cir. 1996).  In Hilao, working under the supervision of a \ncourt appointed special master and aided by a statistics expert, plaintiffs tried the \nliability and damages claims of approximately 10,000 class members on the basis \nof a sample of 137 class members chosen by statistical methods.  The district \ncourt then distributed aggregate damages among the three subclasses based on \nan average of the representative awards for each subclass.  One panel of the Fifth \nCircuit indicated approval of sampling techniques to determine class-wide tort \ndamages, and even cited to Hilao with approval in In re Chevron U.S.A., 109 F.3d \n1016, 1020 (5th Cir. 1997) (inferences about a group may be drawn from a \nsample if the sample is scientifically chosen; the reliability of the statistical \nmethod protects the due process right of the defendant from having to pay a \nlarger award than it owes), citing to Hilao, 103 F.3d at 782-84, 786.  Aggregate \ndamage trials using sampling are common in other types of federal cases.  Segar \nv. Smith, 738 F.2d 1249, 1264 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (calculating back pay and front \npay in Title VII case on a class-wide basis using statistical methods); Long v. \nTrans World Airlines, 761 F. Supp. 1320, 1326 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (limiting discovery \nto members of a sample of the class and ruling that plaintiffs can try a class wide \namount for damages including intangible injuries such as pain and suffering to a \njury using sampling); In re Sugar Industrial Antitrust Litigation, 73 FRD 322, 353 \n(E.D. Pa. 1976) (proposing statistical method of determining damages); Blue \nCross & Blue Shield of N.J., Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 133 F. Supp. 2d 162, 169 \nPLAINTI FF 126-14 \n\n   \n(E.D.N.Y. 2001); In re Simon II Litig., 211 F.R.D. 86, 147 (E.D.N.Y. 2002), vacated \nand remanded on other grounds, 407 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 2005).. \n  “There is no constitutional, statutory, procedural, or theoretical bar to \naggregate recovery for the class.”  3 Newberg on Class Actions §10.5 at 483-487 \n(4th ed. 2002).  Sampling passes muster under both the Due Process Clause and \nthe Seventh Amendment.   \n      a.  Sampling Does Not Violate the Seventh Amendment \n  The use of aggregated proof, based upon sampling in plaintiffs' damages \nclaim, does not violate a Defendant’s right to a jury trial.  See, e.g., Long, 761 F. \nSupp. at 1326; In re Simon II Litig., 211 F.R.D. 86, 154 (E.D.N.Y. 2002), vacated \nand remanded on other grounds, 407 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 2005).  The most \ncommonly raised objection to aggregate damage trials is that the procedure \nviolates the defendant’s Seventh Amendment jury trial right by denying the \ndefendant a right to confront each plaintiff about his individual damages.  Cimino \nv. Raymark Indus., Inc., 151 F.3d 297, 321 (5th Cir. 1998); In re Fibreboard \nCorp., 893 F.2d 706, 709 (5th Cir. 1990).  Defendants often contend that \nindividualized discovery and jury trial are necessary because each class member \nmay be differently situated with respect to damages.   \n  However, nothing in the Seventh Amendment gives a defendant an \nindividual right of confrontation.  Sampling is appropriate even if the Court were \nto find that defendant does have a right to try damages individually.  As the Long \ncourt put it, “the very purpose of a statistical model is to account for individual \nPLAINTI FF 126-15 \n\n   \nissues.”  Long, 761 F. Supp. at 1326.  Accordingly, the presence of individual \nissues does not, in itself, render the use of a statistical model inappropriate under \nthe Seventh Amendment. \n      b.  Sampling Does Not Deprive Defendant of Due Process \n  Aggregate damages in no way infringe on a defendant’s due process rights.  \nDellums, 566 F.2d at 189;.  The Dellums Court specifically stated, “Nor do we \nthink that determination of damages in this case requires individualization.”  Id.  \nThe Hilao Court rejected the defendant’s due process challenge, relying on the \nanalysis established in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) for determining \nwhether a procedure by which a private party invokes state power to deprive \nanother person of property satisfies due process.3  Aggregate damages trials using \nsampling also pass muster under this test.  Justice Improved: The Unrecognized \nBenefits of Aggregation and Sampling in the Trial of Mass Torts,  44 Stan. L. Rev. \nat 828. \n  Once aggregate damages are established against the defendants, the \nproblem of allocations among classes and distribution within each class largely \nbecomes a plaintiffs’ problem.  In re Simon II Litig., 211 F.R.D. 86, 103 (E.D.N.Y. \n2002), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 407 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 2005).  The \ndefendant has no interest in the division of class damages among the class \nmembers providing the amount of class-wide damages is accurate.  Id.  Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n3 In Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1 (1991), the Supreme Court refined the third \nprong of the Mathews test for disputes involving only private parties. \nPLAINTI FF 126-16 \n\n   \nvote on whether to accept distribution of class damages by exercising (or not \nexercising) their opt-out rights.   \n  Aggregate proof of a defendant's monetary liability is just as accurate as \nclass treatment of other elements of liability.  Long, 761 F. Supp. at 1330.  It is \nnot unusual, and probably more common than otherwise in many types of cases, \nthat aggregate evidence of the defendant's liability is more accurate and precise \nthan would be so with individual proofs of loss.\"  Id., citing to Newberg at 349.  As \nthe Bell Court observed, “statistical sampling does not dispense with proof of \ndamages but rather offers a different method of proof.” Id., 9 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 574.   \n  The use of sampled data is neither pro-plaintiff nor pro-defendant but \nfavors adjudication on the merits of a legal dispute rather than disposition \naccording to information costs.  The use of statistical sampling for both damages \nand liability is especially effective given the disparity in power between the pre-\ntrial detainees, Central Booking and its prison system.  Given the number of pre-\ntrial detainees, scientifically valid random sampling and statistical analysis are an \neffective means to bolster representative testimony. \n3. Procedures followed in trying class-wide damages to a jury \nusing sampling in Hilao   \n  The seminal case for statistical sampling in cases involving non-economic \ndamages is Hilao, 103 F.3d at 774.  In Hilao, the Ninth Circuit upheld \ncertification of a damages class of approximately 10,000 Philippine nationals or \ntheir estates who sought damages as a result of acts of torture, “disappearance”, \nor summary execution that occurred over a 14 year period under the regime of \nPLAINTI FF 126-17 \n\n   \nFerdinand E. Marcos.   The Ninth Circuit approved the court's use of a statistical \nsample of the class claims in order to compute and award compensatory damages \nto the class members.  The trial was trifurcated into (1) liability (2) punitive \ndamages and (3) compensatory damage phases. \nLiability was determined by a jury trial of 22 plaintiffs.  In the third phase \nof the trial (the compensatory damage phase) the Court allowed the jury to \nconsider damages to a random sample of plaintiffs as representative of the \ninjuries suffered by the subclasses.  To address plaintiffs’ due process concerns, \nthe individual plaintiffs were given the choice of opting out of the certified class \naction and proceeding with individual trials. \n  The district court made the following initial findings: of 10,059 claims, the \ncourt ruled that 518 were invalid leaving 9,541 claims.   Sampling methodology \nwas then applied to these valid claims.  Of these, 137 were randomly selected by \ncomputer.  An inferential statistician testified that the examination of 137 sample \nclaims would achieve a “95 percent statistical probability that same percentage \ndetermined to be valid among the examined claims would be applicable to the \ntotality of the claims filed.”  Hilao, at p.782. \nA special master was appointed to oversee the depositions of the sample \n137 depending on the definition or category in which the claimant fell.  The \nspecial master then determined the category for that plaintiff based upon \ndefinitions established in the liability phase of the trial, for example torture, \nsummary execution, or disappearance.  The jury was free to accept, modify, or \nPLAINTI FF 126-18 \n\n   \nreject the award.  Id.  The Ninth Circuit held that, given the similarity in damages \nof the subclasses, the benefit of the statistical sampling method was “enormous” \ngiven the prospect of trying 10,000 individual cases.  Id. at p.786.    \nThe special master then recommended the amount of damages to be \nawarded to each claimant, Id. at p.783, by further breaking down the three \nclasses in the liability phase into damage classes.  For example, for the torture \nvictims he considered duration of time, length of detention, methods of torture \nused, and the age of the victim.  For those persons who summarily disappeared, \nthe special master considered whether they were first tortured, whether there was \nactual murder, the family’s anguish, and lost earnings.  Id. \n   Thereafter the statistician in Hilao testified to his methodology and his \nrecommendations of damage awards. Id. at 783.  On appeal before the Ninth \nCircuit, the Estate of Marcos unsuccessfully challenged the statistical \nmethodology employed to determine the class claims.   \n4. Procedures to be followed in trying class-wide damages to a \njury using sampling in this case \n  The following is a summary of Plaintiffs’ proposed procedure for trying \ndamages on an aggregate basis.  Plaintiffs can elaborate on the procedure as \ndiscovery becomes available and as the Court directs. \n(cid:190)  Generate a class list for Overdetention Class (including length of \noverdetention of each class member) and class list of each of the Strip \nSearch Classes using database discovery from Central Booking’s \nAutomated Booking System and other discovery.  Bryan Miller’s affidavit \nPLAINTI FF 126-19 \n\n   \nexplains how the number of strip search class members can be established \nusing statistical and other techniques if the search pattern was applied to \nmost or many but not all arrestees.  (Declaration at Plaintiffs’ Exhibit # 97, \nsubmitted with Document 35 on November 30, 2005; it is not re-filed again \nhere, but is included as an exhibit with the chambers copy)   \n(cid:190)  Statistics expert Richard Berk, Ph. D. (Declaration at Plaintiffs’ Exhibit # \n96, submitted with Document 35 on November 30, 2005; it is not re-filed \nagain here, but is included as an exhibit with the chambers copy) selects \nsamples for each class using reliable statistical methods. \n(cid:190)  Parties conduct discovery of sample plaintiffs under the supervision of a \nspecial master. \n(cid:190)  Medical and psychiatric expert Dr. Susan Fiester (Plaintiffs’ Exhibit # 125, \nsubmitted herewith) examines members and samples and makes diagnoses \nwith explanation of factors on which diagnoses based. \n(cid:190)  Special master makes recommendation on the amount of damages to be \nawarded each sample plaintiff on the basis of depositions and submissions \nof the parties. \n(cid:190)  Jury trial at which plaintiffs’ statistics expert can testify (where evidence \nsupports testimony) that the selection of the random sample met the \nstandards of inferential statistics, that efforts to locate and obtain \ntestimony from the claimants in the random sample “were of the highest \nstandards,” that the procedures followed conformed to the standards of \nPLAINTI FF 126-20 \n\n   \ninferential statistics, and that the injuries of the random-sample claimants \nwere representative of the class as a whole. \n(cid:190)  Jury trial at which plaintiffs’ medical psychiatric expert can testify  \nregarding diagnoses and bases of diagnoses. \n(cid:190)  Jury trial at which testimony of sample plaintiffs and their witnesses is \npresented. \n(cid:190)  Jury trial at which special master testifies about his recommendations and \nreport given to jury. \n(cid:190)  Jury or the Court determines formula or point system for distributing the \nclass damages among class members.  Distribution methods are discussed \nbelow. \n  Discovery.  Plaintiffs suggest that a statistical model, based on discovery \nfrom a random sample, can adequately address the various damages issues.  \nPlaintiffs propose limiting discovery to members of the sample using depositions.  \nIn Hilao the discovery from the sample was limited to depositions supervised by \nthe special master.  Hilao, at 782. \n  Class members.  All class members for the overdetention class can be \nreadily determined from defendant’s records.  Additional discovery is expected to \nflesh out whether any of the Central Booking search room officers did not follow \nthe practice and procedure of conducting blanket strip searches of arrestees; as \nfor underwear searches, discovery has revealed that recently, at a minimum, \nPLAINTI FF 126-21 \n\n   \nevery male was automatically strip-searched to his underwear, so any male who \nmight be excluded from the full strip search classes will fall into the underwear \nstrip search class.    \n  Distribution of lump sum award.  Any award can be allocated among class \nmembers based on a per day or per hour amount for Overdetention Class \nmembers (including, perhaps, a flat amount for each overdetained person, plus \nan amount for each additional hour) or a per incident amount for Strip Search \nClass members.  Alternative methods include allowing the jury to set a \ndistribution matrix utilizing a formula or a point system or allowing the court to \nset the distribution method.  In Dellums the jury awarded damages along a \nsliding scale which took into account the different experiences of different \nmembers of the class, without losing administrative feasibility.  566 F.2d at n.6 \nand at 189.  Judge Weinstein in Simon II describes how damage awards in the \nAgent Orange, Dalkon Shield, and Holocaust litigations, for example, have been \nappropriately distributed through court fixed and administered schemes.  In re \nSimon II Litig., 211 F.R.D. 86, 103, 110, 147 (E.D.N.Y. 2002), vacated and \nremanded on other grounds, 407 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 2005). \n  Cy pres.  Plaintiffs expect to be able to identify and locate most class \nmembers using data in defendants’ databases, and through publication and \npublicity.  See J. Douglas Richards, American Antitrust Institute Symposium: \nThinking Creatively About Remedies: What Makes an Antitrust Class Action \nRemedy Successful?: A Tale of Two Settlements, 80 Tul. L. Rev. 621 (December, \n2005) (discussing methods of identifying class members using electronic data and \nPLAINTI FF 126-22 \n\n   \navailable remedies).  But, Plaintiffs propose that any residue (e.g., funds allocated \nto class members who cannot be located or de minimis amounts) be paid to a cy \npres fund where the unclaimed funds may be distributed for the indirect \nprospective benefit of the class. See Democratic Cent. Comm. v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Commission, 84 F.3d 451 (D.C. Cir. 1996); In re Airline \nTicket Com’n Antitrust Litigation, 268 F.3d 619, 625 (8th Cir. 2001).  \n \nVIII.    CONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs’ proposed trial plan demonstrates that this case can follow a \ndiscovery plan and be tried in two phases through the use of focused discovery, \ntestimony, surveys, and aggregate damage awards. \n \nRespectfully submitted,  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n___________/s/______________  __________/s/________________ \nSean R.

INTRODUCTION \nThis is a §1983 class action case alleging the overdetention of inmates in the DC Jail past \ntheir court ordered release dates (“Overdetention Claim”), and blanket strip searches of inmates \nreturning from court to the DC Jail after a judge has already ordered their release (“Strip Search \nClaim”).  This Court certified an Overdetention Class on March 31, 2003 (docket # 69) and a Strip \nSearch Class on August 11, 2003 (docket # 93).   \nThe Court certified the Overdetention Class as a Rule 23(b)(2) as to the claims of the class \nmembers for declaratory or injunctive relief.  The Court also certified the damages class under Rule \n23(b)(3), and defined the Overdetention Class using the following two-part class definition: \n “(a) Each person who has been, is, or will be incarcerated in any District of Columbia \nDepartment of Corrections facility in the three years preceding the filing of this action up \nto and until the date this case is terminated; and (b) who was not released, or, in the \nfuture, will not be released by midnight on the date on which the person is entitled to be \nreleased by court order or the date on which the basis for his or her detention has  \notherwise expired.” \n  0\n \n \n\n   \nThe Court certified the Strip Search Class under Rule 23(b)(2) as to the claims of the class \nmembers for declaratory or injunctive relief, and as a Rule 23(b)(3) class for monetary relief. The \nStrip Search Class was defined using the following two-part class definition:  \n“Each person who, in the three years preceding the filing of this action, up until the \ndate  this  case  is  terminated,  has  been,  is  or  will  be:  (i)  in  the  custody  of  the \nDepartment of Corrections; (ii) taken to court form a Department of Corrections \nfacility; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to release by \nvirtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had been held was no \nlonger pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own \nrecognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was \notherwise entitled to release; (iv) was not the subject of any other pending case or \ncases which imposed any condition of release other than personal recognizance; (v) \nwas not the subject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was returned to the DC Jail or CTF \nfrom court, to be processed out of Department of Corrections custody; and (vii) was \nsubjected to a strip search and/or visual body cavity search without any individualized \nfinding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was concealing contraband \nor weapons; before being released, regardless of whether he was overdetained.” \n \nIn the Order certifying the Overdetention Class, the Court also ordered the parties to jointly \nsubmit an agreed-upon proposed order regarding class notification procedures.  If no agreement \ncould be reached on the terms of the proposed order, separate proposed orders were to be submitted \nwithin 30 days.  All parties moved the Court to extend the time for submitting proposed notice \nprocedures for the Overdetention Class until after the Court ruled on plaintiffs’ second motion to \ncertify the Strip Search Class, and until after plaintiffs submitted a proposed trial plan setting forth \ntheir proposal to try damages using sampling and other statistical methods (docket # 78). The Court \ngranted the motions (docket # 81). \nII.   CONSENT SOUGHT BUT NOT OBTAINED \nPlaintiffs have tried to discuss the issues set forth in the proposed trial plan with Defendant \nDistrict of Columbia through opposing counsel Maria Amato and her supervisor Robert Utiger, \nEsq., but have been unable to do so. \n  1\n \n \n\n   \nIII.   PROPOSED TRIAL PLAN \n  Plaintiffs hereby present this proposed trial plan (“Proposed Trial Plan”), which explains  \nPlaintiffs’ planned  approach to discovery, class notice, and trial.  This Proposed Trial Plan is meant \nto aid the Court in determining effective discovery management, the development of notice \nprocedures, and  management of  the trial of the case.  The Proposed Trial Plan is not necessarily \nmeant to be final in the matters of witnesses or exhibits; expert reports; proposing jury instructions \nand special verdict forms, or even adopting a particular methodology of determining damages for \nclass members.  Moreover, the determination of a trial plan will depend on the Court’s decisions \nregarding the most efficient and reasonable method for proceeding to trial on a number of discovery \nmatters presently pending. On this basis, Plaintiffs reserve the right to present a revised and more \ndetailed trial plan once discovery is complete and the trial date nears.      \nIV.   BIFURCATION OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES PHASES \n  Plaintiffs propose that the trial be bifurcated into (1) a liability phase (including \ndetermination of injunctive relief) and (2) a damages phase.  Rule 42(b).  Bifurcation of civil rights \nclass actions into a liability phase and a damages phase is widely recognized and accepted.  See, \ne.g., Berger v. Iron Workers Reinforced Rodmen, Local 201, 170 F.3d 1111 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Neal \nv. Director of Department of Corrections, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11543 (D.D.C. 1995) \n(Memorandum Opinion IV) (Procedures for Absent Class Members) rev’d on other grounds sub \nnominee, Bonds v. District of Columbia, 93 F. 3d 801 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Rule 42(b) permits trial of \nindividual, discrete issues.  As long as separate juries do not re-examine previously resolved fact \ndeterminations, bifurcation does not violate the Seventh Amendment.  Robinson v. Metro-North \nCommuter R.R., 267 F.3d 147, 170 (2d Cir.  2001).  This proposal tracks the Court’s orders \n  2\n \n \n\n   \ncertifying each of the classes as a Eubanks hybrid class. Eubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d 87, 96 \n(D.C.Cir.1997). \n  The central issues to be determined in the liability phase are: (1) whether the District has a \npattern and practice of over detaining inmates past their release dates; (2) whether the District \nviolates the constitutional rights of inmates by overdetaining inmates past their release dates; (3)  \nwhat length of overdetention constitutes an unconstitutional overdetention;  (4) whether the \nDepartment of Corrections has a practice/policy of subjecting inmates to blanket strip searches after \na judge has ordered their release; and (5) whether the Department of Corrections violates the \nconstitutional rights of inmates by subjecting them to blanket strip searches after a judge has \nordered their release.  These issues can probably be determined on a motion for summary judgment \non the applicable legal standard.    \n  Phase II of the trial will address damages.  Plaintiffs propose determining damages (1) in a \nsingle, class-wide damages trial using \"sampling,” or, alternatively, (2) by mini-trials tried to judges \n(and magistrates if defendant agrees), or, alternatively, (3) by a claims procedure agreed upon by \nthe parties.   \n  \"Sampling,\" discussed below, is the process of collecting information from fewer than all \npotential sources.  Laurens Walker, Essay: A Model Plan To Resolve Federal Class Action Cases \nBy Jury Trial, 88 Va. L. Rev. 405 (2002).  In this context, sampling involves randomly selecting a \nfraction of the plaintiffs in the class, trying the damages of each plaintiff in the sample to a jury, \nextrapolating the sampled damage award to determine damages for the class as a whole, and then \ndistributing the class damages among class members according to a formula or point system \ndetermined by the jury or the Court.   \n  3\n \n \n\n   \n  Plaintiffs believe that the damages due the class can be determined in a single jury \nproceeding.  In preparation for the trial, an expert working under the supervision of a special master \nwill generate a random sampling of the class. Through reasonable discovery, defendant can obtain \nfacts relevant to the sample members' experiences during the class period.  Using this data, the \nparties' experts can then extrapolate damages for the entire class.   \nV.      NOTICE PROCEDURES   \n  Notice to class members is not required at Phase I for either class because the issue of \nliability falls under Rule 23(b)(2).  Class actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief under Rule \n23(b)(2) are not subject to the individual notice requirements of Rule 23(c)(2).  Stolz v. United \nBroth. of Carpenters and Joiners of America, 620 F. Supp. 396 (D. Nev. 1985).  \n  Notice is required for Phase II because damages are integral to a Rule 23(b)(3) class.  \nMoreover, notice in the case addresses any due process objections class members might have to a \nclass-wide determination of damages.  Objecting class members would be allowed to opt out of the \nclass in favor of an individual jury trial on damages.  The Court can determine the content of the \nnotice after it rules on the methodology of proving damages.  \n  Plaintiffs submit under separate cover their proposals for notification procedures.  \nVI.   PHASE I – TRIAL OF LIABILITY \n  Determination of liability.  Determination of liability can be made either by trial or by \nmotion for summary judgment.  The fact that the Department of Corrections had a practice (and \nthen a written policy) of subjecting every single person booked into the DC Jail during the class \nperiod to a strip search and visual body cavity search without an individualized finding of \nreasonable suspicion can be established through a motion for summary judgment based upon \nconcessions by the District made in discovery. Any issues of whether any of those searches could be \n  4\n \n \n\n   \nvalidated on other grounds (which plaintiffs contend they could not but defendants presumably \ncontend otherwise) would also be resolved. The result would be that the liability phase would \ndetermine who was unlawfully strip searched. \n For overdetentions, the procedure would be to determine certain issues under special \ninterrogatories from which a determination of the class members who have been overdetained could \nbe made. \n  Methods of proof.  Plaintiffs will prove the District’s liability with evidence based upon \ndeclarations of pre-trial detainees, statistical sampling, analysis of the District’s own computer \nrecords, deposition testimony and witness testimony.  \n  The use of statistical evidence to prove liability in civil rights cases is well established.  \nBerger v. Iron Workers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395, 1413 (D.C. 1998); Davis v. \nCalifano, 613 F.2d 957 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (\"statistical proof may alone be used, without \npresentation of specific instances of discrimination, to establish a prima facie case of employment \ndiscrimination\"); Mitchell v. Diamond Cab Company of District of Columbia, 2003 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 12492, *25 (D.D.C. 2003) (motion for summary judgment) (collecting cases); Simon II, \n2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25632, *156  (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 22, 2002) (citing to extensive body of law \nreview article discussing sampling to prove liability and making point that requiring individual trials \non damages allows wrongdoer to avoid responsibility for conduct).  Both scholars and courts have \nrecognized that, in many cases, statistical methods actually provide a more accurate form of \nevidence than individual testimony.  Simon II, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25632, at *161.   \n  Many categories of federal cases routinely use statistical methods to determine liability and \ndamages.  See, e.g.,  Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 97 S. Ct. 1272, 51 L. Ed. 2d 498 (1977) \n(statistical data to prove discrimination in jury selection); Burger (employment discrimination); \n  5\n \n \n\n   \nZippo Manufacturing Co. v. Rogers Imports, Inc., 216 F. Supp. 670 (S.D.N.Y. 1963) (Feinberg, J.) \n(survey data in trademark infringement case); Cimino v. Raymark Indus., 751 F. Supp. 649, 659 \n(E.D. Tex. 1990) (discussing statistics and its applications in federal cases) rev’d, Cimino v. \nRaymark Indus., Inc., 151 F.3d 297 (5th Cir. 1998).  Courts frequently permit evidence of life-\nexpectancy or mortality tables when determining damages.  See, Ageloff v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 860 \nF.2d 379 (11th Cir. 1988); Asana v. United States, 616 F.2d 41 (2nd Cir. 1980); Larsen v. \nInternational Business Machines Corp., 87 F.R.D. 602 (E.D.Pa. 1980) (use of work-life tables). \nDiscovery.  The databases described in plaintiffs’ motion to compel, other items needed to \nprove liability such as defendant’s witnesses, and limited discovery on liability of absent class \nmembers only, as listed on plaintiffs’ witness list to testify as fact witnesses, would complete the \ndiscovery necessary for Phase I.  At this point, Defendant has no need to depose absent class \nmembers for the liability phase of the trial beyond those on plaintiffs’ witness list.  Dellums v \nPowell, 566 F.2d 167, 187 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (defendant has no absolute right to take discovery from \nabsent class members). \nCosts and Attorneys' Fees.  Plaintiffs will be entitled to an award of costs and reasonable \nattorneys' fees for work expended to this date in this litigation should plaintiffs’ prevail at this \nPhase.  Neal v. Director of Department of Corrections, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11543 at *14. \nVII.  IMPLEMENTATION OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  \n   Plaintiffs will request an injunction ordering that: \n(cid:190)  The Department of Corrections release every sentenced prisoner before midnight on the date \nhis or her sentence expires, and release every pre-trial detainee before midnight on the date \nwhen the last outstanding basis for detention expires for him or her; \n  6\n \n \n\n   \n(cid:190)  Each month, Defendant file with the Court,  and provide to plaintiffs’ counsel, a list of  \ninmates indicating the proposed Release Dates1 for each inmate, a list of inmates released in \nthe previous month, and the  Exit Date and Exit Time for each inmate released in the \nprevious month;  \n(cid:190)  The Court order certain prescribed changes to the Jail and Records Office’s  release \nprocedures (such as staffing, functioning computerization, and staff training). To the extent \nthe Court orders such changes, each month, Defendant shall file with the Court, and provide \nto plaintiffs’ counsel, a monthly report on the Jail and Records Office compliance with the \norder.  \n(cid:190)  Each month, Defendant file with the Court, and provide to plaintiffs’ counsel, a report \nshowing which prisoners and pre-trial detainees were strip searched, when, and at what point \nduring the prisoner/detainee's release process; \n(cid:190)  Defendant not enforce any  District of Columbia statute prohibiting releases of inmates, \notherwise entitled to release, for example, between midnight and 8:00 a.m.; \n(cid:190)  DC Jail refrain from subjecting Strip Search Class members to blanket strip searches after a \njudge has ordered their release.  Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7179 (show cause \ndiscussing PI enjoining strip searches of court returns); \n(cid:190)  Attorney’s fees and costs for the injunctive phase be awarded, as well as monitoring fees for \nthe foregoing. \n                                                 \n1 Unless defined herein, capitalized terms in this motion have the same meaning as in the Third Amended Complaint.  \n“Department of Corrections” means District of Columbia Department of Corrections.  \"Overdetain\" means holding a \ndetainee or prisoner in Department of Corrections' custody past the person’s release date.  “Release Date” for each \ndetainee or inmate is the day on which the person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis \nfor his or her detention has otherwise expired.  “Exit Date” for each detainee or inmate means the date on which he or \nshe was actually released from the custody of the Department of Corrections.  “Exit Time” for each detainee or inmate \n  7\n \n \n\n   \n.Discovery.  Plaintiffs may need additional discovery on the issue of injunctive relief.  The \nscope of that discovery can be determined after plaintiffs receive responses to outstanding discovery \nrequests. \nVIII.  PHASE II –DETERMINING COMPENSATORY DAMAGES \nA.    METHODOLOGY OF DETERMINING COMPENSATORY DAMAGES  \nPhase II of the trial will focus on class damages.  There are three basic methodologies of \ndetermining damages in class actions such as this: (1) in a single class-wide damages trial using \n\"sampling,” or, alternatively, (2) by mini-trials tried to judges (and magistrates if defendant agrees), \nor, alternatively, (3) by a claims procedure agreed upon by the parties.  Each of these methods is \ndiscussed below.  See e.g. Simon II, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25632, * 30 (discussing methods used \nto allocate aggregate damages among claimants).    \n  Plaintiffs propose using the first method, a single trial using \"sampling” to try class-wide \ndamages on an aggregate basis to a jury, as the better approach.  The use of acceptable sampling \ntechniques, in lieu of discovery and the presentation of voluminous data from the entire class, will \nproduce substantial savings in time and expense.  For many class members, sampling techniques \nmay provide the only practicable means to obtain recovery.  See Manual for Complex Litigation \n§21.493, at 101 (3d ed. 1995).   \nB.  TRIAL OF CLASS-WIDE DAMAGES USING  “SAMPLING” \n1.    Aggregate trial \n  Aggregate trials of non-economic damages in civil rights cases are well established in this  \n                                                                                                                                                                  \nmeans the time of day on the date on which he or she was actually released from the custody of the Department of \nCorrections.   \n  8\n \n \n\n   \nCircuit.  Dellums v Powell, 566 F.2d at 189.  In Dellums, the Court of Appeals upheld a jury’s \naward of a lump sum of compensatory damages, and a distribution matrix of damages for unlawful \narrests and illegal detentions based on the arrests.  Id.  The jury in Dellums decided on a lump sum \nfor a class of protestors arrested without probable cause and illegally detained for varying periods.  \nIt then set a schedule according to which damages were assigned to subclasses based upon length of \nillegal incarceration.  The district court then assigned class members to a subclass based upon the \ndetention records of the government.  Id.  The Dellums Court specifically stated, “Nor do we think \nthat determination of damages in this case requires individualization.”  Id.   \n  There is a growing trend in favor of using aggregate damage trials.  3 Newberg on Class \nActions §10.5 at 483-487 (4th ed. 2002);  Long v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 761 F. Supp. 1320, \n1326 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (court limits discovery to members of a sample of the class and rules plaintiffs \ncan try a class-wide amount for damages including intangible injuries such as pain and suffering to \na jury using sampling); Blue Cross & Blue Shield of N.J., Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 133 F. Supp. \n2d 162, 169 (E.D.N.Y. 2001); Simon II, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25632.  See Essay: A Model Plan \nTo Resolve Federal Class Action Cases By Jury Trial, 88 Va. L. Rev. 405.   \n2.  Sampling In General \n  Sampling involves randomly selecting a fraction of  class members, trying the damages of \neach plaintiff in the sample to a jury, extrapolating from the damages of the class to a lump sum for \nthe class, and then distributing the damages among class members according to a formula, or \nmatrix, or point system determined by the jury, or by the Court.  Michael J. Saks & Peter David \nBlanck, Justice Improved: The Unrecognized Benefits of Aggregation and Sampling in the Trial of \nMass Torts, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 815 (1992); 3 Newberg on Class Actions § 10.5 at 483-487.  Courts \n  9\n \n \n\n   \nhave employed various distribution procedures to allocate class awards to class members, some of \nwhich are discussed below. \n  The most influential case in which tort damages were determined in a lump sum for the \nentire class in a rule 23(b)(3) class action is Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 782 (9th Cir. \n1996).  In Hilao, working under the supervision of a court appointed special master and aided by a \nstatistics expert, plaintiffs tried the liability and damages claims of approximately 10,000 class \nmembers on the basis of a sample of 137 class members chosen by statistical methods.  The district \ncourt then distributed aggregate damages among the three subclasses based on an average of the \nrepresentative awards for each subclass.  One panel of the Fifth Circuit indicated approval of \nsampling techniques to determine class-wide tort damages, and even cited to Hilao with approval in \nIn re Chevron U.S.A., 109 F.3d 1016, 1020 (inferences about a group may be drawn from a sample \nonly if the sample is scientifically chosen, because it is the reliability of the statistical method that \nprotects the due process right of the defendant from having to pay a larger award than it owes), \nciting to Hilao, 103 F.3d at 782-84, 786.  Aggregate damage trials using sampling are common in \nother types of federal cases.  Segar v. Smith, 738 F.2d 1249, 1264 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (court calculated \nback pay and front pay in Title VII case on a class-wide basis using statistical methods); Long, 761 \nF. Supp. at 1326 (court limits discovery to members of a sample of the class and rules plaintiffs can \ntry a class wide amount for damages including intangible injuries such as pain and suffering to a \njury using sampling); In re Sugar Industrial Antitrust Litigation, 73 FRD 322, 353 (E.D. Pa. 1976) \n(court proposes determining dames in an aggregate class-wide approach using statistical methods); \nBlue Cross & Blue Shield of N.J., Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 133 F. Supp. 2d 162, 169 (E.D.N.Y. \n2001); Simon II, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25632, at *187. \n  10\n \n \n\n   \n  “There is no constitutional, statutory, procedural, or theoretical bar to aggregate recovery for \nthe class.”  3 Newberg on Class Actions §10.5 at 483-487 (4th ed. 2002).  Sampling passes muster \nunder both the Due Process Clause and the Seventh Amendment.   \n    a.  Sampling Does Not Violate the Seventh Amendment \n  The use of aggregated proof, based upon sampling in plaintiffs' damages claim, does not \nviolate the Seventh Amendment.  Long, 761 F. Supp. at 1326; Simon II, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n25632, at *187.  The most commonly raised objection to aggregate damage trials is that the \nprocedure violates the defendant’s Seventh Amendment jury trial right by denying the defendant a \nright to confront each plaintiff about his individual damages.  Cimino v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 151 \nF.3d 297, 321 (5th Cir. 1998); In re Fibreboard Corp., 893 F.2d 706, 709 (5th Cir. 1990).  \nDefendants often contend that individualized discovery and jury trial are necessary because each \nclass member may be differently situated with respect to damages.   \n  However, nothing in the Seventh Amendment gives a defendant an individual right of \nconfrontation.  Sampling is appropriate even if the Court were to find that defendant does have a \nright to try damages individually.  As the Long court put it, “the very purpose of a statistical model \nis to account for individual issues.”  Long, 761 F. Supp. at 1326.  Accordingly, the presence of \nindividual issues does not, in itself, render the use of a statistical model inappropriate under the \nSeventh Amendment. \n  Moreover, Fifth Circuit cases invalidating the use of statistics to extrapolate findings of \nliability from a group of representative plaintiffs to all plaintiffs (in place of individual jury \nverdicts as to each plaintiff) are based on a peculiar feature of Texas law requiring that causation \nissues be decided on an individual basis.  Cimino v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 151 F.3d 297, 321 (5th \nCir. 1998); In re Fibreboard Corp., 893 F.2d 706, 709 (5th Cir. 1990).  Any language in Cimino \n  11\n \n \n\n   \nstating that the Seventh Amendment requires one-on-one damages trials with individual jury \nverdicts as to each plaintiff is dicta because the holding in Cimino on exposure to asbestos and \ncausation was specifically based on Texas state law.  This Circuit follows a different rule, and \nallows damages to be determined on a class-wide basis, Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d at n.6 and at \n189 (jury awarded damages along a sliding scale which took into account the different experiences \nof different members of the class, without losing administrative feasibility); Segar v. Smith, 738 \nF.2d 1249, 1264 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (court calculated back pay and front pay in Title VII case on a \nclass wide basis using statistical methods).  Moreover, the difficult causation issue in Cimino and \nFibreboard – whether a plaintiff was exposed to asbestos and whether the asbestos or some other \nagent caused the medical condition – is not present here.  In this case, causation is simple and direct.  \nFor any person overdetained past midnight on the day of his release, or whatever time is set by the \ncourt or the jury as the constitutional threshold, the custom and practice of operating the \nDepartment of Corrections without a workable inmate management system caused the \noverdetention.  For any person strip searched, the custom or policy of the Department of \nCorrections of subjecting inmates to blanket strip searches, after a judge has ordered their release, \ncaused the strip search.   \n  In this Circuit, the fact finder may properly infer emotional distress from factual \ncircumstances and award damages to compensate for that injury.  Berger v. Iron Workers \nReinforced Rodmen, Local 201, 170 F.3d 1111, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 1999), citing Memphis Community \nSch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 311 (1986); Daskalea v. District of Columbia, 227 F.3d 433, \n444 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (plaintiff’s mental and emotional distress suffered while in the DC Jail are \ncompensable under §1983, even in the absence of physical injury or corroborating expert testimony \nto establish the causal link between her treatment in prison and her injuries). \n  12\n \n \n\n   \n    b.  Sampling Does Not Deprive Defendant of Due Process \n  Aggregate damages in no way infringe on a defendant’s due process rights.  Dellums, 566 \nF.2d at 189.  The Dellums Court specifically stated, “Nor do we think that determination of \ndamages in this case requires individualization.”  Id.  The Hilao Court rejected defendant’s due \nprocess challenge relying on the analysis established in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) \nfor determining whether a procedure by which a private party invokes state power to deprive \nanother person of property satisfies due process.  Recently, in Connecticut v. Doehr, the Supreme \nCourt has refined the third prong of the Mathews test for disputes involving only private parties.  \nAggregate damages trials using sampling also pass muster under this test.  Justice Improved: The \nUnrecognized Benefits of Aggregation and Sampling in the Trial of Mass Torts,  44 Stan. L. Rev. at \n828. \n  Once aggregate damages are established against the defendants, the problem of allocations \namong classes and distribution within each class largely becomes a plaintiff’s problem.  Simon II, at \n*10.  The defendant has no interest in the division of class damages among the class members \nproviding the amount of class-wide damages is accurate.  Id.  Plaintiffs vote on whether to accept \ndistribution of class damages by exercising (or not exercising) their opt-out rights.   \n  Aggregate proof of a defendant's monetary liability is just as accurate as class treatment of \nother elements of liability.  Long, 761 F. Supp. at 1330.  It is not unusual, and probably more \ncommon than otherwise in many types of cases, that aggregate evidence of the defendant's liability \nis more accurate and precise than would be so with individual proofs of loss.\"  Id., citing to \nNewberg at 349.   \n  The use of sampled data is neither pro-plaintiff nor pro-defendant but favors adjudication on \nthe merits of a legal dispute rather than disposition according to information costs.  The use of \n  13\n \n \n\n   \nstatistical sampling for both damages and liability is especially effective given the disparity in \npower between the pre-trial detainees, the District and its prison system.  Given the number of pre-\ntrial detainees, scientifically valid random sampling and statistical analysis are an effective means to \nbolster representative testimony. \n3.  Procedures followed in trying class-wide damages to a jury using sampling   \n      in Hilao   \n  The seminal case for statistical sampling in cases involving non-economic damages is Hilao, \n103 F.3d at 774.  In Hilao, the Ninth Circuit upheld certification of a damages class of \napproximately 10,000 Philippine nationals or their estates who sought damages as a result of acts of \ntorture, “disappearance”, or summary execution that occurred over a 14 year period under the \nregime of Ferdinand E. Marcos.   The Ninth Circuit approved the district court's use of a statistical \nsample of the class claims in order to compute and award compensatory damages to the class \nmembers.  The trial was trifurcated into (1) liability (2) exemplary damages2 and (3) compensatory \ndamage phases. \nLiability was determined by a jury trial of 22 plaintiffs.  In the third phase of the trial (the \ncompensatory damage phase) the Court allowed the jury to consider damages to a random sample of \nplaintiffs as representative of the injuries suffered by the subclasses.  To address plaintiffs’ due \nprocess concerns, the individual plaintiffs were given the choice of opting out of the certified class \naction and proceeding with individual trials. \n  The district court made the following initial findings: of 10,059 claims, the court ruled that \n518 were invalid leaving 9,541 claims.   Sampling methodology was then applied to these valid  \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiffs are not seeking punitive damages in this case because punitive damages do not lie against a municipality.   \n  14\n \n \n\n   \nclaims.  Of these, 137 were randomly selected by computer.  An inferential statistician testified that \nthe examination of 137 sample claims would achieve a “95 percent statistical probability that same \npercentage determined to be valid among the examined claims would be applicable to the totality of \nthe claims filed.”  Hilao, at p.782. \nA special master was appointed to oversee the depositions of the sample 137 depending on \nthe definition or category in which the claimant fell.  The special master then determined the \ncategory for that plaintiff based upon definitions established in the liability phase of the trial, for \nexample torture, summary execution, or disappearance.  The jury was free to accept, modify, or \nreject the award.  Id.  The Ninth Circuit held that, given the similarity in damages of the subclasses, \nthe statistical sampling method was “enormous” given the prospect of trying 10,000 individual \ncases.  Id. at p.786.    \nThe special master then recommended the amount of damages to be awarded to each \nclaimant, Id. at p.783, by further breaking down the three classes in the liability phase into damage \nclasses.  For example, for the torture victims he considered duration of time, length of detention, \nmethods of torture used, and the age of the victim.  For the those persons who summarily \ndisappeared, the special master considered whether they were first tortured, whether there was \nactual murder, the family’s anguish, and lost earnings.  Ibid. \n   Thereafter the statistician in Hilao testified to his methodology and his recommendations of \ndamage awards. at p.783.  On appeal before the Ninth Circuit, the Estate of Marcos challenged the \nstatistical methodology employed to determine the class claims.   \n  15\n \n \n\n   \n4.  Procedures to be followed in trying class-wide damages to a jury using \n     sampling in this case \n  The following is a summary of Plaintiffs’ proposed procedure for trying damages on an \naggregate basis.  Plaintiffs can elaborate on the procedure as discovery becomes available and as the \nCourt directs. \n(cid:190)  Obtain class list for Overdetention Class (including length of overdetention of each class \nmember) and class list of the Strip Search Class using the database discovery detailed in \nplaintiffs motion to compel (docket # 97); \n(cid:190)  Statistics expert Richard Berk, Ph. D.3 selects sample for each class using reliable statistical \nmethods;  \n(cid:190)  Parties conduct discovery of sample plaintiffs under the supervision of a special master; \n(cid:190)  Special master makes recommendation on the amount of damages to be awarded each \nsample plaintiff on the basis of depositions and submissions of the parties \n(cid:190)  Jury trial at which plaintiffs’ expert can testify (where evidence supports testimony) that the \nselection of the random sample met the standards of inferential statistics, that efforts to \nlocate and obtain testimony from the claimants in the random sample \"were of the highest \nstandards\", that the procedures followed conformed to the standards of inferential statistics, \nand that the injuries of the random-sample claimants were representative of the class as a \nwhole \n(cid:190)  Jury trial at which testimony of sample plaintiffs and their witnesses is presented; \n  16\n \n \n\n   \n(cid:190)  Jury trial at which special master testifies about his recommendations and report given to \njury; \n(cid:190)  Jury or the Court determines formula or point system for distributing the class damages \namong class members.  Distribution methods are discussed below. \n  Discovery.  Plaintiffs suggest that a statistical model, based on discovery from a random \nsample, can adequately address the various damages issues.  Plaintiffs proposing limit discovery to \nmembers of the sample, and to method (such as depositions).  In Hilao the discovery from the \nsample was limited to depositions supervised by the special master.  Hilao, at 782. \n  Class members.  All class members for both classes can be determined from defendant’s \nrecords.  This is not a jury issue.     \n  Distribution of lump sum award.  Any award can be allocated among class members based \non a per diem amount for Overdetention Class members or a per incident amount for Strip Search \nClass members.  Alternative methods include allowing the jury to set a distribution matrix utilizing \na formula or a point system or allowing the court to set the distribution method.  In Dellums  the \njury awarded damages along a sliding scale which took into account the different experiences of \ndifferent members of the class, without losing administrative feasibility.  566 F.2d at n.6 and at 189.  \nJudge Weinstein in Simon II describes how damage awards in the Agent Orange, Dalkon Shield and \nHolocaust litigations, for example, have been appropriately distributed through court fixed and \nadministered schemes.  2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25632, at *30.    \n  Cy pres.  Plaintiffs propose that any residue (e.g. class shares of class members who cannot \nbe located) be paid to a cy pres fund where the unclaimed funds may be distributed for the indirect \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n3 See Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 31 to Consent Motion Of All Parties To Defer Filing Proposed Order Regarding Class \n  17\n \n \n\n   \nprospective benefit of the class. See Democratic Cent. Comm. v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nCommission, 84 F.3d 451 (D.C. Cir. 1996); In re Airline Ticket Com’n Antitrust Litigation, 268 \nF.3d 619, 625 (8th Cir. 2001). \n \nIX.   CONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs’ proposed trial plan demonstrates that this case can be manageably tried in two \nphases through the use of testimony, surveys, and aggregate damage awards. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully moves this Court to grant their motion. \n \nRespectfully submitted,  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n_____________________________  __________________________ \nWILLIAM CLAIBORNE  LYNN CUNNINGHAM \nD.C.

Plaintiffs Eric Jones, Dana West, Gary Saunders, Anthony Haig, Michael \nWashington, and Kevin Adams bring this class action lawsuit on behalf of \nthemselves and all other persons committed to Central Booking who were or \nwill be injured by the Defendants’ conduct in causing them to be (1) subjected \nto blanket strip searches pursuant to their booking at the Baltimore Central \nBooking and Intake Center (“Central Booking”), on charges or in cases not \ninvolving drugs, weapons, or felony violence; or (2) subjected to strip searches \nnot conducted in private, pursuant to their booking at Central Booking \nregardless of the underlying charges because it is the manner of the searches \nthat is unconstitutional; or (3) were males subjected to blanket strip searches \npursuant to their booking at Central Booking regardless of the underlying \ncharges against them because similarly situated women were not subjected to \nsuch searches.   \n2.  Plaintiffs Tonia Bowie, David Colyns, Gary Saunders, Anthony Haig, \nMichael Washington, and Kevin Adams also bring this class action on behalf of \nthemselves and all other persons who were arrested in the City of Baltimore \nbut were not brought before a commissioner or other judicial officer for a \nprobable cause hearing within 48 hours of their arrests.  \n3.  Plaintiff Eric Jones brings an individual claim for his detention after his \narrest without being brought before a commissioner or other judicial officer for \na probable cause hearing within a reasonable time period.  \n  3\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  44  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nClasses \n4.

Plaintiffs move the Court to declare five separate classes, as described \nbelow.  The time period for all classes is from May 12, 2002 through final \njudgment in this case. \n6.  The strip search claims relate to persons committed to Central Booking and \nstrip searched pursuant to their booking at Central Booking.  \n7.  The overdetention claims deal with the detentions of warrantless arrestees \nat Central Booking without a prompt presentment, such as the one set forth in \nMaryland Rule 4-212(f) and required by County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 \nU.S. 44, 111 S.Ct. 1661 (1991).  \n  4\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  55  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n8.  As used herein, “strip search” and “full strip search” include the removal, \npulling down, or rearrangement of clothing for the visual inspection of an \narrested person’s genital and/or anal areas, which may also include requiring \nthe person to squat and cough, in the presence of one or more guards.  \n“Underwear strip search” refers to a strip search to the person’s underwear, \nwithout removing or rearranging the underwear for visual inspection of bare \nskin thereunder. \n9.  Plaintiffs Dana West, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Anthony Haig, and  \nMichael Washington, and the class of persons they seek to represent (the \n“Suspicionless Strip Search Class”) are persons committed to Central Booking \non charges or in cases not involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, who \npursuant to their booking were or will be subjected to strip searches without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that they were concealing \ndrugs, weapons or other contraband, by employees of Central Booking.   \n10. The “Suspicionless Strip Search Class Members” are not commingled with \npersons who have been ordered detained at Central Booking or the Baltimore \nCity Detention Center (either because they could not post a bond or are held \nwithout bond). \n11. The Suspicionless Strip Search Class Members base their claims on the \nFourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits \nsubjecting persons arrested on crimes not involving weapons or drugs to strip \nsearches without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable \ncause that the person was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. \n  5\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  66  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n12. Plaintiffs Dana West, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Anthony Haig, and \nMichael Washington, and the class of persons they seek to represent (the “Non-\nPrivate Strip Search Class”) are persons committed to Central Booking who \nwere or will be subjected to strip searches pursuant to their booking in the \npresence of other arrested persons. \n13. The Non-Private Strip Search Class Members base their claims on the \nFourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits \nsubjecting persons to strip searches in a non-private setting. The Non-Private \nStrip Search Class includes all persons who were strip-searched regardless of \nthe offense on which they were arrested because it is the manner of the search, \nrather than the lack of reasonable suspicion, that makes the search \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \n14. Plaintiffs Dana West, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Anthony Haig, and \nMichael Washington, and the class of persons they seek to represent (the \n“Equal Protection Strip Search Class”), are males committed to Central \nBooking who were or will be subjected to strip searches pursuant to their \nbooking.  Defendants subject male arrestees to such searches, but do not \nsubject similarly situated female arrestees, including women charged with drug \nand violent offenses, to the searches.  \n15. The Equal Protection Strip Search Class Members base their claims on the \nequal protection component of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution, which prohibits treating similarly situated men and women \ndifferently based on their gender. The Equal Protection Strip Search Class \n  6\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  77  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nincludes all males committed to Central Booking who were strip-searched \npursuant to their booking at Central Booking, regardless of the underlying \ncharge on which they were arrested, because it is the application of the search \nto men but not women, rather than the lack of reasonable suspicion, that \nmakes the search unreasonable under the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n16. Plaintiff Kevin Adams seeks to represent a class (the “Underwear Strip \nSearch Class”)1 of persons who are males committed to Central Booking who \nwere or will be subjected to strip searches to their underwear pursuant to their \nbooking at Central Booking.  Defendants subject male arrestees to such \nsearches, but do not subject similarly situated female arrestees, including \nwomen charged with drug and violent offenses, to the searches. \n17. The Underwear Strip Search Class Members base their claims on the equal \nprotection component of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution, which prohibits treating similarly situated men and women \ndifferently based on their gender. The Underwear Strip Search Class includes \nall males committed to Central Booking who were strip-searched to their \nunderwear pursuant to their booking at Central Booking, regardless of the \nunderlying charge on which they were arrested, because it is the application of \nthe search to men but not women, rather than the lack of reasonable \nsuspicion, that makes the search unreasonable under the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n  7\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  88  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n18. Plaintiffs Tonia Bowie, David Colyns, Gary Saunders, Michael Washington, \nAnthony Haig, and Kevin Adams also seek to represent a class (the \n“Overdetention Class”) of persons who were arrested without warrants in the \nCity of Baltimore and held at Central Booking for an unreasonable length of \ntime (more than 48 hours) after their arrests without presentment.  \n19. The Overdetention Class Members base their claims on the Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, which requires a prompt \npresentment such as the one afforded by Maryland Rule 4-212(f), and creates a \npresumption of unreasonability and unconstitutionality if the detention \nwithout presentment exceeds 48 hours.  \n20.  Furthermore, Maryland Rule 4-212(f) requires the presentment be done \n“without unnecessary delay and in no event later than 24 hours.”  The \nMaryland Court of Appeals has held that this Rule implements fundamental \nfederal and state constitutional rights.  Logan v. State, 289 Md. 460, 425 A.2d \n632 (1981). \n21. This action is brought, individually and on behalf of the Classes, against \nMitchell Franks, Susan Murphy, and William Jednorski in their individual \ncapacities, and against the Government of the City of Baltimore and the \nBaltimore City Police Department, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for damages and enforcement of their Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n                                                                  \n1 It is more precisely the “Equal Protection Underwear Strip Search Class,” but \n  8\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  99  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n22. This action is brought by the Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the \nClasses, against Mitchell Franks in his official capacity as Warden of Central \nBooking, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, and against the Government of the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore \nCity Police Department, for prospective injunctive relief to enforce their Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \nJurisdiction And Venue \n23. This Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nand 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) because plaintiffs’ claims are based on Section 1983 \nand the Constitution. \n24. Venue is appropriate in this District.  The claim for relief arose from events \nand occurrences in this judicial district. \nParties-Plaintiffs \n25. Plaintiff Dana T. West was arrested by an officer of the Baltimore City \nPolice Department on January 13, 2005 on a charge of leaving the scene of an \naccident (traffic case number 0CZ82715, District Court of Maryland for \nBaltimore City). \n26.

On each occasion, Mr. Saunders was taken to and placed in the custody of \nCentral Booking. \n53. On each occasion, Gary Saunders was strip searched pursuant to his \nbooking at Central Booking. \n54.

Defendant \n  16\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  1177  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nSusan Murphy was the assistant warden at Central Booking from \napproximately March 2001 until being appointed Warden.  She is sued in her \nindividual capacity.    \n88. Defendant William Jednorski was warden of Central Booking from before \nMay 12, 2002 until March 2004.  He is sued in his individual capacity.   \n89. Because Defendants Mitchell Franks, Susan Murphy, and William \nJednorski were wardens responsible for the operation of Central Booking at \ndifferent times, certain allegations are made herein with reference to the “the \nWarden.”  Such allegations refer to each of these Defendants for the time \nperiod during which he or she was warden. \n90. At all times described herein, Defendants Mitchell Franks, Susan Murphy, \nand William Jednorski were acting under color of state law. \n91. At all times described herein, Defendants Mitchell Franks, Susan Murphy, \nand William Jednorski were acting within the scope of his and her employment. \n92. Wherever in this Complaint “Central Booking” may be alleged to have done \nor not done an act, or had or lacked a policy or practice, such allegation is \nintended as an allegation against the respective Warden, and done by him or \nher or caused by his or her acts, policies, and practices, or lack thereof. \n93. Defendant Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (“City of Baltimore” or \n“City”) is a municipal corporation with power to sue or be sued in any court. \n94. Defendant Baltimore City Police Department (“BPD”) is, for the purposes of \n  17\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  1188  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n42 U.S.C. § 1983, a local government entity. \n95. The BPD Commissioner is appointed by the Mayor of the City of Baltimore; \nthe organizational chart of the City of Baltimore lists the BPD as a department \nof the City; the BPD is under the control of the City; and officers of the BPD \nperform police functions typical of a municipal, not state, government police \ndepartment. \n96. Defendant BPD is, for all relevant legal and practical purposes herein, part \nof the government of the City of Baltimore.  For the purposes of this Complaint, \n“Baltimore City Police Department” or “BPD” is intended to include the Mayor \nand City Council of Baltimore. \n97. There are other police agencies within the City of Baltimore that are, for all \nrelevant legal and practical purposes herein, part of the government of the City \nof Baltimore and under the control of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, \nsuch as the Baltimore City Housing police.  Such police agencies have made \narrests during the class period on behalf of the City of Baltimore and \ncommitted such persons to Central Booking.    \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nCentral Booking \n98. The Baltimore Central Booking and Central Intake Center opened in 1995 \nas the central location for booking and processing arrestees in Baltimore City.   \n99. Central Booking is an agency of the Division of Pretrial Detention and \nServices, which in turn is a division of the Maryland Department of Public \n  18\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  1199  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nSafety and Correctional Services. \n100.  The Division of Pretrial Detention and Services has jurisdiction over three \nagencies which handle the booking, processing, custody and control of \nBaltimore City arrestees:  \na.  The Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center; \nb.  The Baltimore City Detention Center (“Detention Center”); and \nc.  The Pretrial Release Service Program. \n101.  Approximately 100,000 arrestees are processed yearly in Central \nBooking.  \n102.  Central Booking is not a detention center where persons are held \npending trial or in a post conviction stage \n103.  Some persons detained and awaiting trial, while waiting for space at the \nDetention Center, may remain at Central Booking temporarily and housed \nseparately in different locations from arrestees.  \n104.  The Baltimore City Detention Center is the pretrial detention facility for \npersons arrested in the City of Baltimore and detained while awaiting trial. \n105.   The Detention Center is in a separate building from Central Booking. \n106.  In the City of Baltimore, persons arrested in the City of Baltimore, \nincluding persons arrested by the Baltimore City Police Department and other \npolice agencies under the authority and control of the City of Baltimore, are \n  19\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2200  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\ntaken by the police to Central Booking for booking and processing.   \n107.  Central Booking contains a central booking unit, a medical unit, a \nclassification unit, records unit, court commissioner's offices, video bail \nfacilities, and a computerized Arrest Booking System.  \n108.  The Arrest Booking System provides fingerprint based identification of \noffenders utilizing Live Scan fingerprint technology, coupled with the State of \nMaryland’s Automated Fingerprint Identification System. \n109.  The Live Scan system employs technology that enables a positive \nidentification of persons, that is, an identification based on the unique, \nbiometric characteristic of fingerprints. \n110.  Many persons taken to Central Booking are arrestees who are brought in \non very minor charges that could have been processed through citations (a \ncitation is an order by a police officer to appear in court on a specified date \nwithout an arrest).  \n111.  Police officials have identified the use of citations as one way to reduce \nthe number of minor offenders who end up at Central Booking.   \n112.  However, the BPD and the City of Baltimore have failed to use citations \nin lieu of arrests due to a gross failure to properly train their officers in the \nproper methods for completing and issuing citations, and due to a desire and \npractice of summarily imprisoning persons for prior crimes believed to have \nbeen possibly committed. \n  20\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2211  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n113.  The BPD and the City of Baltimore have further failed to use sufficient \ndiscretion in the decision of whether to arrest persons; have rewarded police \nofficers for the quantity of arrests regardless of whether the arrests are based \non probable cause, amounting to an arrest quota system; have encouraged and \nratified overly aggressive and unconstitutional policing of streets and false \narrests; and have failed to sufficiently train and encourage the prompt filing of \narrest paperwork and entry of data into the arrest booking system. \n114.  Approximately one-third of the people whom city police arrest, and \ncommit to Central Booking, not including those picked up on warrants, never \neven face charges, such as where prosecutors determine that there is not \nenough evidence to support a charge, or that the alleged wrongdoing, such as \nloitering, was abated by the arrest, and “decline” the case, that is, decline to \nprosecute the case. \n115.  The percentage of persons arrested by the BPD and the City of Baltimore, \ncommitted to Central Booking, but not charged dwarfs the percentages in other \nMaryland jurisdictions, which have had “no charge” rates of less than one-half \nof 1 percent. \n116.  Persons arrested by BPD, committed to Central Booking, but not charged \nare so commonplace among Central Booking arrestees that they are referred to \nby Central Booking officials and others by a descriptive name:  “Walk \nThroughs.”  \n117.  The BPD and the City have failed to use other options available in lieu of \n  21\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2222  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\ntaking arrestees to Central Booking. \n118.  Persons arrested in warrantless arrests and committed to Central \nBooking are held at Central Booking following arrest until their presentment \nbefore a commissioner for a probable cause determination and pretrial release \ndetermination, the dropping of charges, and other reasons.  \n119.  Persons who are ordered detained before trial, or who are ordered held \npending posting of bond, are held in Central Booking before being “committed” \nto the “Towers,” that is, the Baltimore City Detention Center.   \n120.  Persons ordered released at presentment or who have their charges \ndropped are segregated from the “committed” persons in separate holding areas \npending release.   \n121.  Persons ordered committed at presentment are held separately from both \npersons awaiting presentment, persons ordered released at presentment, and \npersons who have their charges dropped. \n122.  In 2000, Central Booking processed 66,541 male arrestees and 15,854 \nfemale arrestees.   \n123.  Of the 82,395 people processed, 38,123 were released on their own \nrecognizance.   \n124.  Central Booking was designed to process up to 45,000 arrestees \nannually. \n125.  However, despite already exceeding Central Booking’s capacity in 2000, \n  22\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2233  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nthe BPD and the City of Baltimore, rather than look for ways to reduce the \nnumber of persons arrested or, once arrested, the number of arrested persons \ntaken to Central Booking, escalated the number of arrests and took them all to \nCentral Booking.   \n126.  The number of persons arrested each year in the City by BPD and taken \nto Central Booking by BPD has steadily increased since 2000 and now exceeds \n100,000 persons per year. \n127.  The BPD and the City have throughout the class period continued to \narrest and commit persons to Central Booking knowing that Central Booking \nhas been operating in excess of full capacity throughout the class period. \n128.  Central Booking has no effective management system for booking and \nprocessing arrestees.  \n129.  Central Booking does not maintain and update its computerized booking \nand inmate management systems and has allowed its booking and processing \nand inmate management systems to collapse. \n130.  The Wardens have maintained a policy and practice of maintaining a \npresentment and detention policy at Central Booking that simply delays all \npresentments and detains arrestees until the system, in its sweet time, and \nwith the resources it chooses, is ready to make presentments or drop the \ncharges. \n131.  The fact that Central Booking has no effective booking or inmate \nmanagement system has been documented by a series of reports and \n  23\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2244  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nnewspaper articles, as well as by court cases dating back many years.   \n132.  At the extreme end, the fundamental dysfunction and mismanagement of \nCentral Booking led to the May 2005 beating death by guards of a 52-year-old \nman detained on a $150.00 bond.   \n133.  During the class period and before, Central Booking has had problems \nstopping the flow of contraband into Central Booking by Central Booking \nofficers. \n134.  The City of Baltimore has described Central Booking as “dysfunctional” \nand lacking “appropriate or adequate management systems and practices to \nassure performance and accountability.”  COMPLAINT OF THE MAYOR AND CITY OF \nBALTIMORE, filed against Warden Susan Murphy, Rodney et al. v. Murphy, \nCircuit Court for Baltimore City, 24-C-05-004405, ¶¶ 8-9 (June 29, 2005). \n135.  The overcrowding and overdetentions are a longstanding, pervasive and \ncontinuing problem known to defendants during the class period. \n136.  The detention and release of arrestees in Central Booking is currently \ngoverned partly by a temporary restraining order (the “Order”) issued in the \ncase of Richard Rodney et al. v. Susan Murphy, Circuit Court for Baltimore \nCity, case number 24-C-05004405.   \n137.  The Order requires the warden of Central Booking to present each \narrested person to a judicial officer no later than 24 hours after arrest, and to \nrelease any arrested person upon their being held for more than 24 hours \nwithout presentment, subject to the warden’s right to move the court for \n  24\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2255  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\ncontinued detention of such a person upon a showing of good cause.   \n138.  The Order has been extended to February 9, 2006.  \n139.  Upon information and belief, the Order has led to a reduction of the \nnumber of arrestees held more than 48 hours without presentment. \n140.  The Order did not enable Central Booking, the City, and the BPD to do \nanything they could have not done during and before the class period, had they \ndesired to do so and cease violating the constitutional rights of arrestees. \n141.  The Order does not address the strip searching of arrested persons. \nThe Warden’s Responsibilities For Arrestees \nAt Central Booking \n \n142.  The Warden’s duties include training, supervising, monitoring and \ndisciplining Booking Center staff. \n143.  The Warden’s duties also include formulating, implementing, and \nexecuting policies concerning the operation of Central Booking facilities.  \n144.  These duties include promulgating and implementing policies controlling \nthe strip searches of arrestees, and promulgating and implementing policies \nensuring the prompt presentment of arrestees, and the release of arrestees \nfollowing their presentments or the dropping of charges.  \n145.  The Warden has day-to-day training, supervisory, and disciplinary \nauthority for all operations of Central Booking. \n146.  The Warden is also responsible for ensuring that each employee of \n  25\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2266  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nCentral Booking discharges his or her duties in accordance with the law and \ncourt orders. \n147.  For each arrested person brought to Central Booking, the Warden “holds \nthe key to the cell” and has the power and ability to release arrestees arrested \nin warrantless arrests up and until a judicial officer issues a commitment order \nfor an arrestee. \n148.  The Warden has the authority under the U.S. Constitution to release, or \nto order the release of, persons arrested in warrantless arrests if the arrestees \nhave not had a probable cause hearing within 48 hours of arrest, absent \nexceptional circumstances. \n149.  At all times throughout the class period, the Warden has access to the \nArrest Booking System and other data giving him or her same-time actual or \nconstructive knowledge of the following:  (a) the date and time each and every \nperson was arrested; (b) the fact that the person is placed into the custody of \nCentral Booking; (c) the gender of the person; (d) the charges on which the \nperson was arrested; (e) the date and time the person is brought into Central \nBooking; and (f) the fact that each and every person detained without \npresentment for more than 48 hours after arrest, or for an otherwise \nunreasonable length of time, is being so detained. \n150.  The Arrest Booking System maintained during the class period has had a \nqueuing system that continuously tracks the amount of time each arrestee has \nbeen detained at Central Booking without presentment, and shows where the \n  26\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2277  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nperson is in the booking process.   \nCentral Booking Practice Of Strip Searching Arrestees \n151.  During the class period Central Booking has had and continues to have a \nwritten policy that allows males committed to Central Booking, pursuant to \ntheir booking process, to be automatically searched to their underwear, and \nthen strip searched for whatever reason, in any manner, and in the presence of \nother arrested males, if the searching officer for any reason suspects – \nreasonably or not -- that the male in their custody is concealing contraband.  \n152.   Meanwhile, Central Booking has had and continues to have a written \npolicy whereby similarly situated women are, instead of being patted down and \nstrip searched to their underwear, are only patted down above their clothing, \nwith no mention of underwear or full strip searches. \n153.  Neither the written strip search policies nor the strip search practices in \neffect at Central Booking take account of a person’s charge when deciding to \nconduct a strip search. \n154.  Central Booking has and has had an informal practices of strip searching \nmen, to their underwear or, in the vast majority of cases, to their bare genital \nand anal areas, in situations where similarly-situated women are not strip \nsearched; of strip searching men charged with crimes not commonly associated \nwith the possession of weapons or drugs; and of strip searching persons in the \npresence of other persons in custody and staff not needed for that person’s \nsearch. \n  27\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2288  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n155.  Staff at Central Booking subject all men to underwear strip searches and \nvirtually all men to full strip searches during the booking process without \nindividualized reasonable suspicion based on the appearance or actions of the \nperson, type of charge, or other criteria. \n156.  Staff at Central Booking subject virtually no women to strip searches \nbefore pursuant to the booking process, and do not subject women to the \nautomatic underwear strip searches to which men are subjected. \n157.  As a result of these policies and practices, virtually every male committed \nto Central Booking where the underlying charges involve drugs, weapons, or \nfelony violence, is strip searched pursuant to the booking process without an \nindividual determination of reasonable suspicion to justify the search, and \nregardless of the crime with which the person is charged.  Men who are not \nsubjected to the full strip search are subjected to an underwear strip search to \nwhich similarly-situated women are not subjected. \n158.  As a result of these policies and practices, a substantial percentage of \nmales committed to Central Booking where the underlying charges do not \ninvolve drugs, weapons, or felony violence, are subjected to a strip search \npursuant to the booking process without an individual or other determination \nof any kind of reasonable suspicion to justify the search, and regardless of the \ncrime with which the person is charged, while all such men are subjected to an \nunderwear strip search.  \n159.  As a result of these policies and practices, virtually all persons strip \n  28\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  2299  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nsearched at Central Booking as part of the booking process are strip searched \nin the presence of other persons.  \n160.  The great majority of strip searches of the men at Central Booking are \nnot reasonably related to any legitimate security interest of Central Booking \nbecause the searches are not rationally related to any reason to believe the \npersons searched are concealing contraband in a place that would be revealed \nby the search.  \n161.  Central Booking does not keep any logs or other records of any individual \nstrip searches performed during the booking process. \n162.  Each Warden had actual or constructive knowledge of the \naforementioned strip search practices during his or her tenure, if not before. \n163.  Each Warden failed to take appropriate action(s) to ensure that persons \nin their custody are strip-searched upon individualized suspicion rather than \nbased upon gender or due to blanket searches; or to ensure that persons are \nstrip-searched in a private setting. \n164.  Each Warden during the class period had actual or constructive \nknowledge that the staff of Central Booking were subjecting virtually all men \nbut virtually no women to strip searches, and all men but no women to blanket \nunderwear strip searches, that were not reasonably related to a legitimate \nsecurity interest of the institution, the Wardens were deliberately indifferent to \nthe rights of persons to be free from unconstitutional strip searches (or the \nWardens tacitly authorized the searches), and there is a direct causal link \n  29\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  3300  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nbetween the inaction and failure to supervise of the Wardens and the injuries \nsuffered by the persons who were illegally strip searched. \n165.  The City of Baltimore, and the Baltimore City Police Department, through \ntheir agents, have had actual or constructive knowledge of the aforementioned \npractices since at least 2001.   \n166.  Nonetheless, the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment knowingly and as part of its policy, practice, and custom places its \narrestees into the custody of Central Booking. \n167.  The BPD and the City have an affirmative duty to protect arrestees from \nharm, including the risk of violations of constitutional rights by a third party to \nwhom the arrestees are transferred. \n168.  The BPD and the City had a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm \nto persons arrested by its police officers by not arresting and committing \npersons to Central Booking. \n169.     The BPD and the City had a reasonable opportunity to prevent the \nharm to persons arrested by its police officers by not arresting and committing \npersons to Central Booking where probable cause for the arrest did not exist. \n170.  The BPD and the City had a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm \nto persons arrested by its police officers by not arresting and committing \npersons to Central Booking who, even though probable cause for the arrest \nexisted, the BPD and the City knew would not be charged. \n  30\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  3311  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n171.  The BPD and the City had a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm \nto persons arrested by its police officers but who could have been issued a \ncitation in lieu of arrest, including those arrested simply so that Central \nBooking could obtain their identities. \n172.  The BPD and the City wholly failed to take any affirmative act reasonably \ncalculated to protect arrested persons and prevent unconstitutional full and \nunderwear strip searches. \nCentral Booking Practice Of Detaining Arrestees Booked Into Central \nBooking \n173.  Central Booking, despite having presentments conducted on-site, has an \ninformal practice of detaining thousands of persons arrested without warrants \nfor more than 48 hours without presentment during the class period. \n174.  As a result of these informal practices, a substantial number of persons \narrested and processed at Central Booking are detained for more than 48 \nhours after their arrests without a presentment.   \n175.  Central Booking has even detained a substantial number of persons \nmore than 3 days before presenting them. \n176.  Central Booking has even detained a substantial number of persons \nmore than 4 days before presenting them.  \n177.  Central Booking keeps computerized logs showing the arrestees’ times of \narrest, arrival at Central Booking, presentment, and release, among other \nevents. \n  31\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  3322  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n178.   Each Warden had actual or constructive knowledge of the \naforementioned practices during his or her tenure, if not before. \n179.  The Warden failed to take appropriate action(s) to reduce the demands \non Central Booking or increase the capacity of Central Booking to process more \narrestees, such that arrested persons brought to Central Booking could be \nprocessed in a timely manner. \n180.  Each Warden has had same-time actual or constructive knowledge the \nmoment each and every person was being detained without presentment \nbeyond 48 hours after arrest, but failed to either release each such person at \nthe expiration of 48 hours or ensure that each such person was presented to a \ncommissioner or other judicial officer, and instead continued to detain each \nsuch person without presentment.  \n181.  Each Warden during the class period had actual or constructive \nknowledge that the staff of Central Booking were not presenting arrestees \nbefore 48 hours, the Wardens were deliberately indifferent to the rights of male \nand female arrestees to be presented within 48 hours of arrest, or the Wardens \ntacitly authorized the overdetentions, and there is a direct causal link between \nthe inaction and failure to supervise of the Wardens and the injuries suffered \nby the men and women arrestees who were not presented within 48 hours of \narrest. \n182.  The City of Baltimore, and the Baltimore City Police Department, through \ntheir agents, have had actual or constructive knowledge of the aforementioned \n  32\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  3333  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\npractices since at least 2001.   \n183.  Nonetheless, the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment knowingly and as part of their policy, practice, and custom places \nits arrestees into the custody of Central Booking. \n184.  The BPD and the City have an affirmative duty to protect arrestees from \nharm, including the risk of violations of constitutional rights by a third party to \nwhom the arrestees are transferred.   \n185.  The BPD and the City had reasonable opportunity to prevent their \narrestees from being held at Central Booking for 48 hours after arrest without \npresentment, such as by using those methods described herein above. \n186.  The BPD and the City wholly failed to take any affirmative act reasonably \ncalculated to protect arrested persons and prevent unconstitutional detentions \nwithout presentment. \n187.  In August 2005 a study commissioned by the State of Maryland that \nanalyzed the processing of persons committed to Central Booking and the \nprocesses of moving arrestees through Central Booking concluded that 24 \nhours was all the time needed to process arrestees through Central Booking \nand present them to judicial officers for probable cause hearings. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nSuspicionless Strip Search Class \n188.  The Suspicionless Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \n  33\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  3344  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nRules 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years preceding \nthe filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, was or will be, \n(a) committed to Central Booking; (b) on charges or in cases not involving \nweapons, drugs, or felony violence, and (c) strip searched pursuant to the \nbooking process without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause that the person was concealing drugs, weapons or other \ncontraband. \n189.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n190.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches not based on individualized or \nparticularized suspicion or probable cause. \n191.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n192.  Regarding the Suspicionless Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and members \nof the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because \n  34\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  3355  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nevery member of the Class is subjected to the strip search practice, and none of \nthe defendants has kept or keeps records of the searches and therefore none of \nthe defendants can show that any of the searches were conducted based on an \nindividual determination of reasonable suspicion.  Should records exist \ndemonstrating that such an individualized suspicion was used in the strip \nsearch determination, such people would, by definition, not be members of the \nclass. \n193.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n  a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Central Booking have and \nhave had policies, customs, and/or practices of subjecting arrestees being \nbooked at Central Booking to strip searches without an individualized \ndetermination that the person was in possession of drugs, weapons, or other \ncontraband; \n  b.  whether such policies, customs, and/or practices, if found to exist, \nviolates the Fourth Amendment; \n  c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the rights of \nsuch arrestees;   \n  d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have sustained \ndamages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n  e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n  35\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  3366  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n  f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n194.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n195.  Central Booking has within its records the names and addresses of all \nthe current and past class members in its computerized booking system.  \n196.  The Suspicionless Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, because they and all other members \nof the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the unlawful \nstrip searches. \n197.  The Suspicionless Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and have retained \ncounsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights \nclass action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n198.  The Suspicionless Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no interests that \nare contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n199.  The Suspicionless Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty \nthat will be encountered in the management of this litigation that would \npreclude its maintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to \nany other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the \n  36\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  3377  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nSuspicionless Strip Search Class.  The class action will be manageable, in part, \nbecause such an advanced computerized system exists from which to ascertain \nthe members of the putative class.  For example, Central Booking had stated \nthat it has “the most advanced technological system in the world for processing \narrestees.” Class treatment will be superior because liability can be determined \non a class wide basis, and damages can also be determined on a class wide \nbasis through use of statistical sampling. \nNon-Private Strip Search Class \n200.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years preceding \nthe filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, was or will be, \n(a) committed to Central Booking and (b) strip searched pursuant to their \nbooking in the presence of other arrestees or staff not needed for the search. \n201.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n202.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches not in private. \n203.

Regarding the Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and members \nof the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because \nevery member of the Class is subjected to the non-private strip search.  \n205.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Central Booking have and have \nhad policies, customs, and/or practices of subjecting arrestees being \nbooked at Central Booking to strip searches in the presence of other \narrested persons; \nb.  whether such policies, customs, and practices, if found to exist, \nviolates the Fourth Amendment; \nc.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the rights of \nsuch arrestees;   \nd.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have sustained \ndamages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \ne.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future members \nare entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that relief; \nand \nf.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \n  38\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  3399  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of \nall class members’ damages except those who opt out. \n206.

The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class and have retained counsel \nwho are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action \nlitigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n210.

The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action \nunder Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years \npreceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, is \n(a) a male (b) committed to Central Booking, and (d) strip searched pursuant to \nhis booking. \n213.

The class action will be in part manageable because such an advanced \ncomputerized system exists from which to ascertain the members of the \nputative class, and that contains the times of all relevant events for \ndetermining the length of detention beyond 48 hours.  For example, Central \nBooking had stated that it has “the most advanced technological system in the \nworld for processing arrestees.” Class treatment will be superior because \nliability can be determined on a class wide basis, and damages can also be \ndetermined on a class wide basis through use of statistical sampling. \nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nCOUNT 1 \n248.

The City of Baltimore’s and the Baltimore City Police Department’s \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of the Overdetention Named Plaintiff and \nthe other class members to be free from detention without presentment within \n48 hours was the moving force behind their injuries.  \n343.

Plaintiff Eric Jones alleges and incorporates by reference all allegations \nset forth above in this Complaint. \n346.  This Count is an individual claim filed against Defendant Murphy in her \nindividual capacity. \n347.  After his arrest, Eric Jones was unreasonably and unjustifiably held \nwithout presentment for at least 36 after his arrest. \n348.  Defendant Murphy, through the arrest booking system and other means \nof information, had same-time actual or constructive knowledge that Mr. Jones \nhad been unreasonably detained without presentment for more than 24 hours, \nand then more than 36 hours, but failed to either release each him or ensure \nthat he was presented to a commissioner or other judicial officer, and instead \ncontinued to detain him without presentment. \n349.  Defendant Murphy, through the arrest booking system and other means \nof information, had same-time actual or constructive knowledge that Mr. Jones \nwas not immediately released after the posting of his bond, and was thereafter \n  68\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  6699  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nnot released after a superfluous commissioner’s release order was issued, and \ninstead continued to detain him unnecessarily for approximately 4 or more \nadditional hours. \n350.  Defendant Murphy failed to supervise and train her staff in the need for \nprompt presentments and post-bond releases when the need for supervision \ntraining was obvious, and remained inactive in the face of actual or \nconstructive notice of the illegal detentions without presentment and after the \nposting of bond. \n351.  Defendant Murphy’s actions, and failure to act, as described above, \ndirectly and proximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the \nviolations of Eric Jones’ Fourth Amendment Rights. \n352.  Defendant Murphy engaged in and oversaw the customs and practices of \nchronic detentions without presentment and unreasonably delays in release \nfollowing the posting of bond, which were the moving force behind the \ndeprivation of Eric Jones’ Fourth Amendment Rights and injuries resulting \nfrom the unreasonable and excessive detention. \n353.  Defendant Murphy caused the detention of Eric Jones by deliberate \nindifference to the risk of constitutional injury by maintaining and/or \nacquiescing in a practice and custom of detaining persons for an unreasonable \nlength of time without presentment and after the posting of bond. \n354.  Defendant Murphy acted intentionally and unreasonably in violation of \nthe Fourth Amendment rights Eric Jones  \n  69\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  7700  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n355.  For all actions relating to this count, Defendant Murphy was acting \nwithin the scope of her employment, her acts were motivated by a desire to \nfurther the interests of Central Booking, the City of Baltimore, and the State of \nMaryland, and was acting in furtherance of the business of Central Booking, \nthe City of Baltimore, and the State of Maryland. \n356.  Defendant Murphy is therefore liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for \nconstitutional injuries to Eric Jones caused by the above-described conduct. \nCOUNT 10 \n357.  Eric Jones re-alleges and incorporates by reference all allegations set \nforth above in this Complaint. \n358.  This is an individual Count is filed against Defendants City of Baltimore \nand the Baltimore City Police Department for their policies, customs, and \npractices violating the constitutional rights of Eric Jones. \n359.  All actions by the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment alleged herein are pursuant to the policies, customs, and practices \nof the Baltimore City Police Department and the City of Baltimore. \n360.  The City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police Department \ntransported Eric Jones to and placed him in the custody of Central Booking, \nwith the actual or constructive knowledge that the he would face a substantial \nrisk of constitutional violations set forth in Count 9. \n361.  The City of Baltimore had control over the City’s and the Baltimore City \n  70\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  7711  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nPolice Department’s policy of transporting arrested persons to and placing \nthem in the custody of Central Booking.  \n362.  The City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police Department knew \nthat Defendant Warden was deliberately indifferent to the rights of persons to \nbe free from the constitutional violations set forth in Count 9. \n363.  Still, the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police Department \nplaced Eric Jones into the custody of Central Booking. \n364.  The City of Baltimore’s and the Baltimore City Police Department’s \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of Eric Jones to be free from unreasonable \ndetention without presentment, and unreasonably after the posting of bond, \nwas the moving force behind his injuries.  \n365.  The BPD and the City have an affirmative duty to protect arrestees from \nharm, including the risk of violations of constitutional rights by a third party to \nwhom the arrestees are transferred.  The BPD and the City wholly failed to take \nany affirmative act reasonably calculated to protect Eric Jones and prevent the \nunconstitutional harms alleged herein. \n366.  Defendants City of Baltimore and Baltimore City Police Department are  \ntherefore liable under the Fourth and the Fourteenth Amendments through 42 \nU.S.C. §1983 for constitutional injuries to Eric Jones caused by their conduct \ndescribed herein and are jointly and severally liable with all other defendants \nfor injuries caused by their conduct described herein. \n  71\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  7722  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\nCOUNT 11 \n367.  The Underwear Strip Search Named Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporates \nby reference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n368.  This Count is filed against Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski in \ntheir individual capacities for all purposes, and their official capacities for \npurposes of prospective injunctive relief. \n369.  Pursuant to their booking at Central Booking, each of the Underwear \nStrip Search Named Plaintiffs and every other class member are males who \nwere or will be subjected to an underwear strip search under a custom and \npolicy that caused them to be strip searched to their underwear but not \nsimilarly-situated women. \n370.  There is no legitimate governmental interest justifying the different \ntreatment between men and women. \n371.  Subjecting an arrestee to an underwear strip search on the basis of \ngender, regardless of the charge or suspicion, violates his or her Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights. \n372.  The Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that the \nUnderwear Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and other class members were being \nor would be subjected to the underwear strip searches and acquiesced in the \nsearches. \n373.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski failed to supervise and train \n  72\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  7733  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\ntheir staff in strip searches when the need for supervision and training was \nobvious, and remained inactive in the face of actual or constructive notice of \nthe illegal searches. \n374.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski have each had a written \npolicy that authorizes male arrestees to be automatically searched to their \nunderwear, and then strip searched for whatever reason, in any manner, and \nin the presence of other arrested males, if the searching officer for any reason \nsuspects – reasonably or not -- that the arrested male is concealing \ncontraband. Meanwhile, Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski have each \nhad a written policy whereby similarly situated women, instead of being patted \ndown and searched to their underwear, are only patted down above their \nclothing, with no mention of a strip search of any kind. \n375.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nUnderwear Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights. \n376.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski engaged in and oversaw the \ncustoms and practices described above, which were the moving force behind \nthe deprivations to the Underwear Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and other \nclass members’ Fourteenth Amendment Rights, and Underwear Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiffs and the other class members’ injuries resulting from the strip \nsearches. \n  73\n\nCCaassee  11::0055--ccvv--0011228877--CCCCBB          DDooccuummeenntt  5515--41          FFiilleedd  0034//1170//22000066          PPaaggee  7744  ooff  8800(cid:10)(cid:10)\n377.

Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski acted intentionally and \nunreasonably in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the \nUnderwear Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class members  \n379.  For all actions relating to this complaint, Defendants Franks, Murphy, \nand Jednorski and other employees of Central Booking were acting within the \nscope of their employment, their acts were motivated by a desire to further the \ninterests of Central Booking, the City of Baltimore, and the State of Maryland, \nand such employees were acting in furtherance of the business of Central \nBooking, the City of Baltimore, and the State of Maryland. \n380.  Defendant Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski are therefore liable under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 for constitutional injuries to the Underwear Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and all other class members caused by their conduct. \nCOUNT 12 \n381.

The City of Baltimore’s and the Baltimore City Police Department’s \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of the Underwear Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and the other class members to be free from underwear strip searches \nbased on gender was the moving force behind their injuries.  \n390.

CCB 05 CV 1287 \n \nSUSAN MURPHY, et al. \n \n    Defendants \n  \nPLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n  Eric Jones et al., Plaintiffs, by and through undersigned counsel, file this \nmotion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (“A party claiming relief may move . . . for \nsummary judgment on all or part of the claim.”) \nISSUE \nWhether the gender-differentiated search policies for male and female \narrestees at Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center, as set forth in post \norders prior to January 1, 2006, under which men, but not women, were to be \nsearched to their last layer of clothing, violated the Equal Protection Clause. 1   \n                                                 \n1 The parties disagree as to the actual strip search practices.  Plaintiffs’ claim \nas to the searches to the underwear (Count 11 of the Fourth Amended \nComplaint) is plead and argued in the alternative to the Counts dealing with \nbare skin searches.  \nThe Defendants’ position is that the post orders reflect the actual practice, and \nthat CBIC staff searched males (but not females) only down to their underwear.  \n  1\n\nINTRODUCTION \nDefendants’ alleged policy of subjecting male but not female arrestees to \nunderwear searches violates the Equal Protection Clause because the \nclassification is based on gender stereotypes and assertions not supported by \nobjective experience and data.  The Defendant Wardens and State offer no \nobjective data in support of their basic premise that males are substantially \nmore likely than females to try to introduce contraband into the Baltimore \nCentral Booking and Intake Center (CBIC), such that a more invasive search of \nmale arrestees is justified.  This policy is challenged in Count 11 of the Fourth \nAmended Complaint.     \n                                                                                                                                                             \nThis motion seeks judgment on the constitutionality of the policy claimed by \nthe Wardens. \nHowever, Plaintiffs contend that, through much of the class period, CBIC staff \nsubjected arrestees to strip searches down to their bare skin, either by a full-\nnaked search or a search by which pants (or skirts) and underwear were pulled \nto the knees.  The underwear searches may be viewed as a “lesser included \noffense” of skin strip searches, because a person has to be searched down to \nhis underwear before he can be searched down to his skin, and thus \nrepresents an area of factual agreement for the parties (i.e., that all men were \nat least searched to their underwear).  But the Plaintiffs’ position is that the \nblanket searches did not stop at the underwear for men (or at patdowns for \nwomen). \nBy seeking summary judgment on the issue of whether the Defendants’ alleged \nsearch policy was unconstitutional, the Plaintiffs are not abandoning their \nclaim that the Wardens subjected arrestees to searches down to their skin \nduring the class period.  Plaintiffs reserve for another motion the issue of \nwhether CBIC officers (with the acquiescence of the Wardens) were subjecting \nmales and/or females to searches down to the skin, and whether this more \ninvasive search was the actual policy and practice. \n  2\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n  Male and female incoming arrestees for the City of Baltimore go to the  \nCBIC and get processed through various posts prior to presentment:  Sallyport \n→ Medical Triage → Search Room → Booking → Identification → Telephone \nCall → Holding → Commissioner (if charged).2  The CBIC, on other floors, also \nhouses persons committed pending trial.  Approximately 80% of arrestees \nentering the CBIC are male.  Exhibit 101, Deposition of Benjamin Brown III, p. \n273 (hereinafter “Brown”).3\n  The CBIC Post Orders for searching arrestees in the search room, prior to \nJanuary 1, 2006, read: \nPost Order, Female Search Officer,  Post Order, Men’s Search Officer, \nEff. Date 11/16/98 (Rev. 8/20/04),  Eff. 11/16/98, Rev. 8/20/04), \nExhibit 102.  Exhibit 103. \nUpon arrival, all offenders [sic] will be  Upon arrival, all offenders [sic] will be \npat frisk searched.  searched down to the underwear.4  If \nthe search room officer suspects \n  contraband is being concealed \nbeneath the underwear, then a strip \nsearch will be conducted. \n \nThe disparate search policies are also described by Assistant Commissioner \nBrown in his deposition testimony.  Brown 209-210.  Effective January 1, \n                                                 \n2 The State runs CBIC pursuant to a statutory state takeover of the City’s \npretrial detention facilities.  Ann Code of Md., Corr. Servs. § 5-101 et seq. \n3 Exhibit numbers continue from those previously filed in this case. \n4 The post orders also require a pat frisk search of male arrestees.  Exhibit \n105, Post Order, Men’s Sallyport, Eff. 12/1/97, Rev. 8/20/04.  Therefore, the \nsearch of male arrestees to the underwear is not in lieu of a pat frisk, but in \naddition to it. \n  3\n\n2006, the search policies for male and female arrestees at CBIC are the same \n(both to be searched to their underwear).  Exhibits 106 and 107. \n  If weapons or sharp objects are found on an arrestee in the Sallyport or \nSearch Room, the item is discarded without entry in a log.  Exhibit 108 \n(excerpt), Deposition of Vernon Irvine, pp. 101-102, 106; Exhibit 109 (excerpt), \nDeposition of Delphries Watties, pp. 33-35; Exhibit 110 (excerpt), Deposition \nof Maurice Diggs, pp. 24, 27-28; Exhibit 111 (excerpt), Deposition of Kevin \nEstep Jr., pp. 19-20; Exhibit 112 (excerpt), Deposition of Lisa Taylor, pp. 38-\n39. \n  Meanwhile, illegal drugs found on arrestees are turned over to a police \nliaison without entry in a log.  Exhibit 108 pp. 100-102; Exhibit 109 p. 35; \nExhibit 110, pp. 28-29; Exhibit 111 pp. 21-22, 39-40 (stating that illegal drugs \nget recorded in contraband log only if found on the ground and not attributable \nto an arrestee); Exhibit 113 (excerpt), Deposition of Katherine Blackmon, pp. \n35-39, 114-115; Exhibit 114 (excerpt), Deposition of Beverly Stevenson, p. 51; \nExhibit 112 p. 39; Exhibit 115 (excerpt), Deposition of Denise Banks, pp. 52-\n55, 57-58; Brown pp. 60-61 (no log made if drugs found on arrestee). \n  On October 25, 2007, and continued on November 14, 2007, the Plaintiff \ntook a Limited 30(b)(6) deposition of the State of Maryland.  As set forth in the \nNotice of Deposition, “[b]y agreement of the parties and deponent, the subject \nmatter of this deposition will include the policies and practices for searching \narrestees, and facts, findings, and conclusions allegedly justifying such policies \nand practices, at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center.”  The State \n  4\n\ndesignated Benjamin Brown III, Assistant Commissioner (and Acting Deputy \nCommissioner) for the Maryland Division of Pretrial Detention and Services.5\n  Mr. Brown had previously stated in an Affidavit that “It was the \nexperience of the Division that male arrestees entering BCBIC were far more \nlikely than female arrestee to have in their possession weapons, such as knives \nand, on occasions, guns, which, in turn, pose a severe threat to the safety and \nsecurity of the persons on the booking floor.  The Division, therefore, \nimplemented and maintained the gender-differentiated initial search policy. . ..”  \nExhibit 116, Affidavit of Benjamin Brown. \n  Mr. Brown testified at the deposition that a contraband log shows what \ntypes of contraband have been recovered in the entire facility (i.e., not limited \nto the booking floor).  Brown 106-108.6   No effort has ever been made to \nanalyze (1) what is found, (2) where it is found, or (3) what search procedure, if \nany, revealed the contraband.  Brown 109-112.  In addition, no effort has been \nmade to compare the rates by which contraband is recovered from females (or \nfemale areas) versus males.  Brown 111-112.  In fact, no effort has been \nmade to collect or analyze data from any source to compare the rates at \nwhich male versus female arrestees entering the facility possess \ncontraband: \nQ:  Well, has anybody ever gone through any kind of log or \nwriting or reports or anything at Central Booking to compare the \n                                                 \n5 The Division runs CBIC. \n6 This would not include contraband recovered on arrestees in the Sallyports \nor Search Rooms upon entry into CBIC. \n  5\n\nrelative frequency with which contraband is recovered from males \nas opposed to females? \n \nMr. Brown: Not that I know of. \n \nQ:  Do you know why? \n \nA:  No. \n \nQ:  Would it be useful in administering the facility to know on \nan objective basis whether males or females are bringing in more \ncontraband \n \nMR. POTHIER:  Objection. \n \nA:  Like any data that’s available to management, it can be \nuseful. I’m not sure that whether – I’m not sure why. \n \nBrown 112-113. \n  Additional questioning specifically focused on weapons revealed a similar \nlack of investigation or study: \nQ:  [Has} anybody ever made an analysis of weapons recovered \nfrom people in Central Booking to determine whether more \nweapons are recovered from males or females or vice versa? \n \nA:  Not that I know of. \n \nQ:  So there’s no type of study or investigation based on \nobjective data that’s been conducted to see whether males \nintroduced more weapons into Central Booking than females? \n \nA:  Not that I’m aware of. \n \nQ:  How about cases where people have attempted to introduce \nweapons into Central Booking and the weapons were detected at \nsome point, has anybody ever done any type of investigation or \nanalysis to determine whether males attempt to introduce more \nweapons into Central Booking than females? \n \nA:  Not that I’m aware of. \n \nBrown 113-114; see also, Brown 119-121. \n  6\n\n  Mr. Brown has no opinion as to whether men or women are more likely \nto attempt to introduce contraband other than weapons into CBIC.  Brown \n207-208. \n  As to his affidavit, Mr. Brown stated that his statement that “male \narrestees entering BCBIC were far more likely than female arrestee to have in \ntheir possession weapons, such as knives and, on occasions, guns” would \nmean something along the lines of 5 women out of 100 would have a weapon or \nitem that can be used as a weapon, versus 30 men out of 100.  Brown 221-\n222.7   However, Mr. Brown has no idea whether those estimates are correct: \nQ:  Do you have any estimate of the percentage of male arrestees \nwho come into Central Booking with weapons or things that can be \nused as weapons in their possession? \n \nA:  No, I don’t have an estimate, I’m not aware of an estimate \nbeing made. \n \nQ:  Do you have an estimate of the percentage of female \narrestees coming into Central Booking having in their possession \neither weapons or other items that can be used as weapons? \n \nA:  No. \n \nQ:  When you wrote that male arrestees are far more likely than \nfemale arrestees, what do you consider to be far more likely, that \nphrase you used? \n \nA:  Oh, probably define far more likely in – one in a hundred for \nwomen, ten, twelve, fifteen in a hundred for men. \n \nQ:  But you don’t know, do you, whether or not those are what \nthe actual numbers are? \n                                                 \n7 Though the plural “guns” was used in the affidavit, only one man is known to \nhave possessed a gun upon entering CBIC.  Brown 223.  Mr. Brown does not \nknow where or how it was recovered, e.g., whether it was recovered by way of \nan underwear search.  Id. 226. \n  7\n\n \nA:  No. \n \nBrown 262-263. \n  Mr. Brown justifies the statement in his affidavit based on subjective, \nvague, and unquantified conversations he had with several persons.  On one \noccasion “a long time ago,” Kenneth Bartee, the security chief for the Baltimore \nCity Detention Center (not CBIC), allegedly stated that he believed males were \nmore likely than females to try to introduce weapons at the Detention Center, \nand Mr. Brown also testified that “I believe Chief Merritt has indicated that \nthat’s what he believes.”  Brown 195-201.  Later, Mr. Brown identified \ncomments from several persons:  Security Chief Childs, Warden William \nJednorski, Assistant Warden France, Warden Susan Murphy, Major Whitley, \nMajor Becketts, Major Shields, and a “couple of representatives from the \nBaltimore City Police.  Brown 270. \n  As to each, Mr. Brown testified as follows. \nSecurity Chief Childs \nBrown:  I remember Chief Childs commenting more about the \nlikelihood of the police missing weapons, but by inference that he was \ntalking about males, \n \nQ:  By inference how? \n \nA:  We were talking about the male sallyport at the time. \n \nQ:  So the discussion didn’t relate to males versus females, did it? \n \nA:  No. \n \nBrown 271. \n  8\n\nWarden Jednorski \nBrown:  Again, a similar comment about the experience with the \npolice missing things, that his was – I do remember some comment \nabout being concerned about men bringing weapons in, not, not women. \n \nQ:  Do you know why he stated that concern? \n \nA:  I – my assumption is based on his experience as a corrections  \nprofessional for twenty-five or thirty-five years. \n \nQ:  So from what you could tell, he wasn’t concerned about women \nbringing weapons into the facility? \n \nA:  Not – not as concerned as he was about men. \n \nQ:  Did he say why? \n \nA:  I don’t recall him ever saying why. \n \nBrown 271-272 \nAssistant Warden France \nBrown:  The only conversation I can recall with Mr. France was \nconcerning the use of metal detector equipment. \n \nQ:  What discussion did you have? \n \nA:  As to whether it was worth us considering trying to find funding to \nput a similar metal detector in the women’s sallyport as we have in – had \nin the men’s at the time. \n \nQ:  What did you decide? \n \nA:  Not to. \n \nQ:  Why not? \n \nA:  It – basically they couldn’t justify it, that’s his statement, that he \ncouldn’t justify the expense. \n \nQ:  Do you know why not?  Did he say why not? \n \nA:  I don’t recall whether he actually said why not or not. \n \n  9\n\nBrown 272-273. \nWarden Murphy \nQ:  What discussion did you have with Warden Murphy regarding \nweapons entering the facility through incoming arrestees? \n \nA:  Just general discussion of the need for the staff to make sure that \nthe police didn’t miss something. \n \nQ:  Did that discussion relate to men versus women? \n \nA:  As best as I can recall, it was generally addressed to the men’s \nsallyport. \n \nQ:  Why do you believe that? \n \nA:  Because that’s where we, we were at the time when we were talking \nabout it. \n \nBrown 273-274. \nMajors \nQ:  Do you recall any of specific discussions you had with any of the \nmajors that you mentioned, being Majors Whitley, Beckett, and Shields? \n \nA:  No, I can’t recall any, the specifics of any discussions. \n \nBrown 274. \nBaltimore City Police \nQ:  You also mentioned discussions with Baltimore City Police.  Do \nyou recall any specific – \n \nA:  No, I don’t. . .. \n \nBrown 274. \n  Mr. Brown testified that the following are some items that could be used \nas weapons:  pieces of metal, pieces of plastic, fragments of glass, knitting \nneedles, keys, key rings, rings, bracelets, boots, earrings, scarves, shoestrings.  \n  10\n\nBrown 299-300.  Mr. Brown conceded that women are just as likely as men to \nhave these items.  Brown 299-300. \n  Mr. Brown further testified as to the relationship between the charge a \nperson is arrested for, and the likelihood that the person possesses a weapon.  \nBrown 224-226.8  Mr. Brown alleged that men are more likely than women to \nenter CBIC for violent crimes.  Brown 287.  He testified that he does not know \nif the crime charged, rather than gender, is the relevant variable and therefore \ncould account for any perceived differences in men versus women having \nweapons in their possession.  Brown 288.  He has absolutely no information or \nopinion as to whether similarly-situated males and females have any difference \nin the likelihood of having weapons in their possession.  Brown 288-289.  In \nfact, Mr. Brown considers the arrest charge a potentially more relevant factor \nthan gender.  Brown 289-290 (stating that it would be more important to \nsearch a women arrested for attempted murder and possession of cocaine than \na man arrested for driving on a suspended license). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Gender Discrimination Is Subject to Heightened Scrutiny \nGovernmental gender discrimination violates the Equal Protection clause \nunless the government shows an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for the \ndisparate treatment.  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531 (U.S. 1996) \n                                                 \n8 The arrest charge is listed on the toe tag of each arrestee who enters CBIC.  \nBrown 291-292. \n  11\n\n(involving the Virginia Military Institute, at times hereafter referred to as the \n“VMI case”).  To meet its burden of establishing an “exceedingly persuasive \njustification,” the government must show “at least that [i] the classification \nserves important governmental objectives and that [ii] the discriminatory \nmeans employed are substantially related to the achievement of those \nobjectives.”   Id. at 524.   \nThe Court stated it is not an easy burden: \nThe burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the \nState.  The State must show ‘at least that the [challenged] classification \nserves “'important governmental objectives and that the \ndiscriminatory means employed” are “substantially related to the \nachievement of those objectives.’”  The justification must be genuine, \nnot hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.  And it \nmust not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females. (citations omitted) \n \nId. at 533 (emphasis added). \nAll gender-based classifications today warrant “heightened scrutiny.”  Id. \nat 555.  The mere recitation of an alleged “benign purpose” does not block \ninquiry into the “actual purposes” of government-maintained gender-based \nclassifications.   Id. at 536.  The reviewing court must make a “searching \nanalysis” of the government’s “alleged objective” for establishing the gender \nbased classification.  The VMI Court did not define the term “searching \nanalysis,” but, as part of its analysis of gender stereotypes, the Court relied on \nobjective “field studies” based on quantifiable data to evaluate Virginia’s \n“alleged objective” for establishing the gender based classification at VMI.  The \nCourt notes that field studies in other cases did not confirm gender-based, \n  12\n\nstereotyped fears that allowing women to engage in medical and policing \nprofessions and studies of performance of women in the nation’s service \nacademies and the military would lead to reduced standards.  Id. at 544.   \nII.  Defendants’ Policy of Subjecting Males But Not Females to \nUnderwear Searches Violates the Equal Protection Clause Because the \nClassification Is Based On Gender Stereotypes and Not Experience and \nData   \nA.  Courts Require Studies Based On Objective Data and Not Just \nConclusory Affidavits to Justify Gender Based Classifications \n  Lower courts both before and after VMI have required government actors \nto justify gender based classifications by studies based on objective data.  For \nexample, in Mary Beth G. v. Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273-1274 (7th Cir. \n1983), the City of Chicago (the “City”) maintained a policy of subjecting females \n(but not males) arrested on minor charges to strip searches.  The City \nintroduced several affidavits of security personnel and one statistical survey in \nan attempt to show that weapons and contraband can be and have been \nconcealed in the vagina and thus the decision to search males and females \ndifferently was based on the documented ability of female arrestees to secrete \nweapons and contraband in the vaginal cavity and the inability to discover \nsuch items by a thorough hand search.  Mary Beth G. v. Chicago, 723 F.2d at \n1274.  But, the Court held that since the evidence also showed that males had \nbody cavities in which contraband could be secreted, the government failed to \nshow why its objective of ensuring the security of the City lockups required it \nto search the vaginal cavity but not the body cavities of males, which can be \nand occasionally are used to conceal weapons or contraband.  Id.  The Court \n  13\n\nheld that the City could not show a “substantial relation between the disparity \nand an important state purpose” because the City has “offered no comparative \ndata to suggest that women arrested for minor offenses conceal items in their \nvaginas to such a degree as to justify strip searching only women and not men \narrested for similar offenses.”  Id. (emphasis added).9   \n  In Deblasio v. Johnson, 128 F. Supp. 2d 315, 328 (D. Va. 2000), a post \nVMI case, the Court relied on “experience and data” to uphold a gender based \nclassification on grooming rules.  In Deblasio, the Court upheld a grooming \nrule requiring males to wear their hair shorter than females because of alleged \nsecurity concerns.  The State based the gender-based hair grooming rules on a \nstudy of Serious Incident Reports since 1989 which showed that a male was \napproximately four times more likely than a female to be cited in the Serious \nIncident Reports in an incident involving violence.  Deblasio v. Johnson, 128 F. \nSupp. 2d 315, 327 n.6 (D. Va. 2000).  But in this case, unlike the government \nin Deblasio, the Defendants offer no objective data in support of the claim that \nmales are more likely to introduce contraband into CBIC.  (Also, the \nDefendants have not established that the underwear search is substantially-\n                                                 \n9  Corrections officials have at times tried, unsuccessfully, to justify more \ninvasive searches of women than men, on the theory that women are more \nlikely to secrete contraband.  Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 \n(7th Cir. 1983); Mack v. Suffolk County, 154 F. Supp. 2d 131, 134 (D. Mass. \n2001); Gary v. Sheahan 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378 (E.D. Ill. 1998); Johnson \nv. District of Columbia, 461 F.Supp.2d 48 (D.D.C. 2007) (denying qualified \nimmunity defense on claim that women, but not men, were subjected to pre-\npresentment strip searches). \n \n  14\n\nrelated to achieve its objective of ensuring the security of CBIC, or that the \njustification was made at the time of the classification.) \n  In the context of searches of arrestees, this Court has held in this case, \nin denying the Wardens’ claims for qualified immunity, that the right to be free \nfrom a gender-differentiated search (whether a full strip search or to the \nunderwear) was clearly established well before the time period in this case.  \nJones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d 537, 548 (D. Md. 2007).  \nB.  The Defendants Lack Any Objective Data or Analysis to \nSupport the Gender-Differentiated Search Policy \n  In this case, the Defendants have no comparative data to show that the \nincidence of items found via underwear searches of males was so much greater \nthan items that could have been found if women were subjected to a similar \nsearch.  Therefore, the Wardens have not met their burden of demonstrating \nthat the difference in gender alone justified the disparate search treatment \naccorded males and females.  Mary Beth G. v. Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1274 \n(7th Cir. 1983). \n  The State, through its 30(b)(6) deposition, conceded that it has never \ndone an analysis of data, or even attempted to collect data, to learn whether \nmen are more likely to possess weapons, or whether similarly-situated male \narrestees (i.e., when controlling the variable of the arrest charge) are even the \nslightest bit more likely than female arrestees to possess weapons.  In fact, it \nappears that the State has avoided collecting and keeping any such data by \n  15\n\ndeclining to make log book or computer entries of contraband found.  The State \nfurther conceded that, regarding items that may not be designed as weapons \nbut could be used as such, it had no reason to believe that men were more \nlikely to possess such items.  \n  Additionally, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that, prior to \nimplementation of the policy, there was any marked difference in the rates of \npossession of weapons, or items that can be used as weapons, between the two \ngenders.  If one gender has been searched but the other has not, it may result \nin more items being found on the searched gender than the unsearched \ngender.  But this may well result not because one gender is more likely to \npossess weapons or things that can be used as weapons, but because only one \ngender was searched (not that any objective data has been presented on the \nquestion of whether, even with the searching of men and non-searching of \nwomen, more weapons and things that can be used as weapons have been \nfound on men). \n  Without data collected or analyses conducted prior to the \nimplementation of the policy, and without any evidence as to the time of \nimplementation of the policy, 10 the State cannot show that the stated \njustification was not a post hoc creation to justify the existing policy, or that it \n                                                 \n10 The Defendants have been unable to produce any versions of search room \npost orders that existed prior to the post orders revised August 20, 2004. \n  16\n\nwas based on anything other than rumor, prejudice, or inconsistent and \nunreliable anecdotal reporting. \nIII.  The Disparate Search Policy is Not Substantially-Related to Any \nImportant Government Objective  \n  Because there is no objective data to support the State’s claim that the \ndisparate-search policy was warranted, the policy fails to survive the \nheightened scrutiny. \n  Furthermore, even if the State’s claimed anecdotal perception that male \narrestees are substantially more likely to possess weapons had been supported \nby data, the policy still must have been substantially-related to the important \ngovernment interest (here, a safe booking facility).  It was not so related. \n  First, when looking at not just weapons but also objects that can be used \nas weapons, the State conceded that it had no information to believe that men \nwere more likely to possess such potentially dangerous items. \n  Second, the State has not claimed that no female arrestees have \npossessed weapons, so the State would have to explain why it does not have an \nimportant government interest in finding weapons possessed by female \narrestees, or if it does have such an interest, why it believed a lesser search \nworked for women but not men.  If the lesser search for women protected the \ngovernment’s important interest, then a greater search for men would not be \nsubstantially-related to the government interest. \n  17\n\n  Third, the State is unable to quantify any perceived difference between \nthe rates that male and female arrestees possess weapons.  Vaguely claiming \nthat men are “more” or even “substantially more” likely to possess weapons, \nwithout quantification, and based solely on self-serving and vague anecdotal \nstatements, leaves one unable to sustain the State’s claim that the policy was \nsubstantially-related to the government interest.  It must be remembered that \nthe State bears the burden. \n  Fourth, the State has conceded that it had no reason to believe that \nsimilarly-situated males were more likely to possess weapons than women.  \nWhen looked at on a charge-neutral basis, the State had no reason to believe \nthat men possessed weapons at a greater rate than women, such that \nsearching a man arrested for driving on a suspended license, but not a woman \narrested for attempted murder and cocaine possession, would make any sense \nat all.  Brown 289-290.   \n  The State has not shown that the gender-differentiated search policy set \nforth in the post orders prior to January 1, 2006, were substantially-related to \nan important government interest. \nCONCLUSION \n  The Defendants have no objective data to support the claimed perception \nthat male arrestees at CBIC are substantially more likely than female arrestees \nto possess weapons, or that male arrestees are any more likely than female \n  18\n\narrestees to possess objects that can be used as weapons.  The Defendants rely \nsolely on subjective, unquantified, anecdotal statements made after the policy \nwas created. \n  The State has also failed to demonstrate that, if substantially more men \nthan women had possessed weapons, that the disparate search policy of \nsearching men but not women to their underwear was substantially-related to \nan important government interest. \n  Therefore, the Court should rule that the gender-differentiated search \npolicy that existed prior to January 1, 2006, violated the Equal Protection \nclause. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n____________/s/________________ \nSean R.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \n \n \nERIC JONES, et al.        : \n            : \n            : \n  v.        :     Civil No. CCB-05-1287 \n            : \n            : \nSUSAN MURPHY, et al.      : \n             \nMEMORANDUM \n \nNow pending in this long-running civil rights litigation are the motions for summary \njudgment filed on behalf of Susan Murphy and William Jednorski, two former wardens of the \nCentral Booking and Intake Center (“CBIC”) in Baltimore City.  The plaintiffs allege violations \nof the Fourth Amendment because they were subjected to a blanket policy of “suspicionless” \nstrip searches before “presentment” to a judicial officer even though they had been arrested for \nminor offenses not involving weapons or contraband and were not being admitted to general \npopulation.  The defendant wardens deny the existence of a blanket policy, deny they are subject \nto supervisory liability, and, at issue for purposes of this opinion, assert the defense of qualified \nimmunity.  For the reasons stated below, considering the unsettled state of the law following the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 132 S. Ct. 1510 (2012), \nthe motions for summary judgment will be granted.1 \nBACKGROUND \n \nPlaintiffs Dana West, Eric Jones, Gary Saunders, Anthony Haig, and Michael \nWashington were each arrested and brought to the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center \n(“Central Booking” or “CBIC”) on charges or in cases not involving weapons, drugs, or felony \n                                                            \n1  Presumably, this would require summary judgment in favor of Warden Mitchell Franks as well, although he has \nnot filed a motion for summary judgment while his motion to shorten the class period has been pending. \n1 \n \n\nviolence at least one time between August 2002 and April 2005. Central Booking is an agency of \nthe Division of Pretrial Detention and Services, which is a division of the Maryland Department \nof Public Safety and Correctional Services. It opened in 1995 and is the centralized location for \nbooking and processing all arrestees in Baltimore City. (See ECF No. 378, Ex. 9.) Between 2002 \nand 2008, Central Booking processed an average of approximately 83,372 arrestees per year, or \n228 per day. (See Nichols Decl., ECF No. 400-58, Ex. 251, ¶ 4.) \nCentral Booking is divided into two sections, the booking area and the housing area.  The \nbooking area is located on the second floor and consists of a central booking unit, a medical unit, \na classification unit, a records unit, court commissioners’ offices, video bail facilities, and a \ncomputerized Arrest Booking System.  (See Murphy Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 12, at 28-29; ECF \nNo. 378, Ex. 9.) It is separate from the housing area, a “maximum security facility” which makes \nup the third, fourth, and fifth floors and houses male pretrial detainees who have been committed \nby a court commissioner.2 (Murphy Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 12, at 28-29; Smith Dep., ECF No. \n400-36, Ex. 205, at 18-19.)  \nAfter passing through a metal detector and pat search at the facility’s entrance, every \narrestee brought to the booking area goes through a process that includes a brief medical exam, a \nmore thorough search, intake at the booking window, and a fingerprint and photo identification. \n(See ECF No. 378, Ex. 9, at 16; Wilson Decl., ECF No. 439-1, Ex. 111, ¶ 2.) Arrestees do not \nenter a “general population” after the initial search during the booking process. (Murphy Dep., \nECF No. 400-34, Ex. 202, at 58-59.) Rather, they are held on the booking floor in group holding \ncells containing up to 20-25 arrestees. (ECF No. 439-1, Ex. 111, ¶ 8.) Arrestees are not \nsegregated within the group holding cells based on charge or criminal history (Id. at ¶ 10.) They \nare placed in these holding cells at any time after being searched in the search room, including \n                                                            \n2 The housing area is not at issue in this case. \n2 \n \n\nbefore going to the booking window, between the booking window and identification, and before \nor after medical evaluations. (Id. at ¶ 8.) Arrestees remain in group holding cells until \npresentment before a court commissioner, generally within 24 hours of their arrival at Central \nBooking. (Murphy Dep., ECF No. 400-34, Ex. 202, at 52.) Once an arrestee has appeared before \na commissioner, he is either released or committed to the housing area on floors three, four, and \nfive of Central Booking, i.e. general population. (See id. at 59; Smith Dep., ECF No. 400-36, Ex. \n205, at 18.)  \nDespite the security procedures in place on the booking floor, contraband use and \nexchange among arrestees is a significant problem.  Staff at Central Booking have observed \narrestees attempting to bring a variety of contraband into the facility, including guns, knives, \nrazors, drugs, cigarettes, money, and cell phones. (See, e.g., Diggs Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 32, at \n22, 88-89; V. Irvine Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 38, at 60, 79, 84-87; L. Jones Dep., ECF No. 378, \nEx. 60, at 24. ) Staff who had conducted naked strip searches identified numerous items they \ndiscovered through such searches. For example, one employee found a knife, on one occasion, \nand drugs, on another, in the rectum of an offender. (V. Irvine Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 38, at 80-\n82.) Another employee found drugs on many occasions as well as lighters, money, cigarettes, \nand razor blades, in the vaginal area of women she searched. (B. Martin Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. \n61, at 28-29, 52, 61.) A third Central Booking staff member reported finding contraband – \nmostly drugs – on approximately half of the people he searched, including “in their buttocks, \n[and] under their testicles.” (Reaves Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 34, at 19.)  \nAt times, arrestees have been successful at smuggling contraband into Central Booking’s \ngroup holding cells. One Central Booking employee reports confiscating cell phones from \narrestees in the cells “numerous times.” (Diggs Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 32, at 106.) Staff also \n3 \n \n\ndescribe smelling marijuana coming from group holding cells on several occasions. (Id. at 108; \nV. Irvine Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 38, at 82).  In one incident, an arrestee was injured by box \ncutters she had carried into the holding cell. (Stevenson Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 58, at 43.) \nIndeed, the plaintiffs themselves observed contraband use and exchange in the holding cells they \nshared with other arrestees. Plaintiff Aaron Ross testified that an arrestee in the group cell in \nwhich he was held pulled out a marijuana joint and matches and passed the joint around to others \nin the cell. (Ross Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 67, at 116.) Plaintiff Tonia Bowie stated that an \narrestee in her holding cell shared drugs hidden in her bra with others in the cell. (Bowie Dep., \nECF No. 378, Ex. 65, at 37-39.)3 \nThe presence of drugs and other contraband at an intake facility like Central Booking \ncreates substantial security concerns. Arrestees who use drugs could become so intoxicated that \nthey might be difficult for staff to handle. (Cook Dep., ECF No. 439-4, Ex. 114, at 82.) Arrestees \ncould overdose on drugs or give or sell them to others who might overdose. (Id. at 81.) In \naddition, arrestees who successfully sneak weapons into the facility could use them to harm other \ninmates or corrections officers. (Id. at 84.) The defendants have acknowledged, however, that \nsecurity is less of a concern on the booking floor as compared to the housing area, and that strip \nsearching was not really necessary to preserve security on the booking floor. (See Murphy Dep., \nECF No. 400-34, Ex. 202, at 59-60; Jednorski Dep., ECF No. 400-33, Ex. 201, at 77.) \nThe representative plaintiffs in this case were arrested in Baltimore City without warrants \non charges not involving drugs, weapons, or felony violence between August 2002 and April \n2005.  Each was brought to the CBIC booking floor, where he was forced to either strip naked or \ndrop his underwear, squat, and cough as part of a search before being taken to a group holding \n                                                            \n3 Neither Ross nor Bowie represents the “suspicionless strip search” class, as neither alleges being strip searched \nwithout reasonable suspicion pursuant to his/her booking at CBIC. \n4 \n \n\ncell. (West Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 64, at 45; Haig Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 66, at 17-18; \nSaunders Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 68, at 24; Washington Dep., ECF No. 378, Ex. 69, at 57-60.) \nPlaintiff Anthony Haig describes also having to lift his genitalia and spread the cheeks of his \nbuttocks before squatting in the presence of an officer and one other arrestee. (ECF No. 378, Ex. \n66, at 17-18.)4 No contraband was found on any of the plaintiffs, nor did the defendants indicate \nany reason to believe the plaintiffs carried contraband into their holding cells.  \nAccording to data from Central Booking’s Automated Booking System (ABS), the \nrepresentative plaintiffs shared cells with numerous different arrestees while they were held at \nCentral Booking. Dana West shared a group holding cell with at least 55 distinct arrestees upon \nbeing booked at CBIC in January 2005. Gary Saunders shared a group holding cell with 20 \ndistinct arrestees in February 2005. Anthony Haig, Michael Washington, and Kevin Adams each \nshared a cell with 35, 36, and 36 distinct arrestees, respectively, in April 2005. Though the \nrepresentative plaintiffs (and, by definition, the class) were arrested on minor charges, some of \ntheir cellmates had been charged with major offenses ranging from armed robbery to first-degree \nassault to distribution of cocaine and heroin.5 (See Felder Decl., ECF No. 439, Ex. 116.) All of \nthe plaintiffs were released directly from the booking floor upon presentment before a court \ncommissioner. None was admitted to general population on the upper floors of CBIC.6  \nThe plaintiffs in this case allege that, pursuant to booking at CBIC, each was strip \nsearched without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion by CBIC employees that he \nwas concealing drugs, weapons, or other contraband. (ECF No. 146, ¶¶ 9, 25-78.) The plaintiffs \n                                                            \n4 None of the plaintiffs reported being touched by officers as part of the search. \n5 The defendants used information contained in Central Booking’s Automated Booking System to identify other \ndetainees with whom each representative plaintiff shared a group holding cell at Central Booking. (See Felder Decl., \nECF No. 439, Ex. 116.) \n6 Indeed, approximately seventy-five percent of individuals arrested without a warrant on charges not involving \ndrugs, weapons, or felony violence between 2002 and 2008 were released directly from the booking floor and never \nentered the general population. (See Nichols Decl., ECF No. 400-58, Ex. 251, ¶ 6.) \n5 \n \n\nseek to challenge this alleged practice via a class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all \nother persons similarly situated. (Id. at ¶¶ 1, 9.) On March 19, 2009, prior to Florence, the court \ncertified the following class:  \nEach person who, during any time from May 12, 2002 until April 30, 2008, was taken to \nBaltimore Central Booking and Intake Center (a) on charges [or in cases] not involving \nweapons, drugs, or felony violence, and (b) strip searched (c) prior to or without \npresentment before a court commissioner or other judicial officer.   \n \n(ECF No. 271.)  The court defined “strip search” for the purpose of class certification as “the \nremoval, pulling down, or rearrangement of clothing for the visual inspection of a person’s \ngenital and/or anal areas, which may also include requiring the person to squat and cough, in the \npresence of one or more guards.” (Id.)   \nANALYSIS \nGovernment actors are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for civil damages \n“insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of \nwhich a reasonable person would have known.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009) \n(quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nIn determining whether qualified immunity applies, courts typically undergo a two-step analysis, \nassessing: (1) “whether the facts that a plaintiff has alleged . . . make out a violation of a \nconstitutional right,” and (2) “whether the right at issue was ‘clearly established’ at the time of a \ndefendant’s alleged misconduct.”  Pearson, 555 U.S. at 232 (internal citation omitted).  Courts \nhave discretion, however, to decide which of the two prongs should be addressed first.  Id. at \n236.   \n“To be clearly established, a right must be sufficiently clear that every reasonable official \nwould [have understood] that what he is doing violates that right,” and “existing precedent must \nhave placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.”  Reichle v. Howards, 132 S. \n6 \n \n\nCt. 2088, 2093 (2012) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Courts should “define \nthe right in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition . . . that is, \n[whether it was] clear to a reasonable officer that the conduct in which he allegedly engaged was \nunlawful in the situation he confronted.” McKinney v. Richland Cnty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 431 F.3d \n415, 417 (4th Cir. 2005). The determination of whether a right was clearly established is \n“essentially [a] legal question,” to be made by the court.  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 \n(1985). This court should look to case law from the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit in \nassessing whether a right is clearly established. Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 251 \n(4th Cir. 1999). \nAt the time of the court’s ruling on the defendants’ motion to dismiss in 2007, and later \nwhen the class was certified in 2009, the wardens did not appear entitled to rely on qualified \nimmunity.  Under Fourth Circuit law, “the right of those arrested for offenses not likely to \ninvolve weapons or contraband to be free from strip searches without any individualized finding \nof reasonable suspicion appears to be clearly established.” Jones v. Murphy, 470 F. Supp. 2d \n537, 547 (D. Md. 2007) (citing Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981); Amaechi \nv. West, 237 F.3d 356, 365 (4th Cir. 2001); Abshire v. Walls, 830 F.2d 1277, 1279-80 (4th Cir. \n1987)).  The recent decision by the Supreme Court in Florence, however, established that it does \nnot violate the Fourth Amendment to require a strip search of every arrestee who will be \nadmitted to the general population of a jail regardless of the offense for which he is arrested and \nwithout the need for individualized suspicion that the arrestee may have contraband or weapons.  \n132 S. Ct. at 1513-14, 1522.7  In so ruling, the Court relied on its analysis in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 \nU.S. 520 (1979), and the need for correctional officials managing a detention center or jail to \n                                                            \n7 The Court noted the imprecision of the term “strip search” and generally described it as a “close visual inspection \nwhile undressed.” 132 S. Ct. at 1513.  It may involve exposure of breasts, buttocks, and genital areas but does not, \nwithin the scope of Florence, include touching of unclothed areas by the inspecting officer.  Id. at 1515. \n7 \n \n\nhave “substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to the problems they face.”  132 S. Ct. \nat 1515.  The Court also explained that “deterring the possession of contraband depends in part \non the ability to conduct searches without predictable exceptions,” id. at 1516, and that \n“deference must be given to the officials in charge of the jail unless there is ‘substantial \nevidence’ demonstrating their response to the situation is exaggerated.”  Id. at 1518. \nThe plaintiffs in this case point out that, under the class definition, although they had \nbeen admitted to CBIC, they had not yet been presented to a judicial officer for a determination \nof whether they would be admitted to the general jail population, or instead released, possibly \neven without presentment.  Thus, they argue that the Fourth Circuit’s prior case law still applies \nto their circumstances, or that they fit within the possible “exceptions” acknowledged by Justices \nKennedy, Roberts, and Alito.  Regarding these “exceptions,” Justice Kennedy noted that the \nCourt was not required “to rule on the types of searches that would be reasonable in instances \nwhere, for example, a detainee will be held without assignment to the general jail population and \nwithout substantial contact with other detainees.”  Id. at 1522.  Justice Alito stated “the Court \ndoes not hold that it is always reasonable to conduct a full strip search of an arrestee whose \ndetention has not been reviewed by a judicial officer and who could be held in available facilities \napart from the general population.”  Id. at 1524.  And Chief Justice Roberts added “the Court \ndoes not foreclose the possibility of an exception to the rule it announces.”  Id. at 1523. \n  Not surprisingly, the arguments by counsel in this case, and the analysis stated in the now \nnumerous opinions which have been issued since Florence, focus on the possible contours of an \nexception to the rule announced by the Court.  The plaintiffs here by definition have not been \npresented to a judicial officer, and were at some point released from CBIC rather than being \nadmitted to the general jail population, thus satisfying certain aspects of a possible exception.  \n8 \n \n\nOn the other hand, they were held in physical facilities that put them in substantial contact with \nother detainees, including some who were later admitted to general population, and under \ncircumstances where contraband was apparently available at least on some occasions.  Analyzing \nsimilar circumstances, a district court in Iowa recently reversed its prior grant of summary \njudgment in favor of the plaintiffs and entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants as \nto the suspicionless strip search of detainees who were never admitted to general population but \nnonetheless on occasion were housed in cells with other detainees or handcuffed together for \ntransportation to court.  Rattray v. Woodbury Co., -- F. Supp. 2d --, 2012 WL 6114994, at **16, \n21 (N.D. Iowa Dec. 10, 2012). \n  The question before this court is not whether the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights \nwere in fact violated but whether, even assuming they fall under an exception to the rule \nannounced in Florence, the right was ‘clearly established” such that “a reasonable person in the \nofficial’s position would have known that his conduct would violate that right.” Edwards, 178 \nF.3d at 251. The court must look to case law from the Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit to make \nthis determination.  Id. \n  It does not appear that the Fourth Circuit has addressed Florence except to note, in an \nunrelated case, the Court’s holding “that strip searches of any and all arrestees housed in general \npopulation of local detention centers and jails are constitutionally permissible.”  Bennett v. R&L \nCarriers, 2012 WL 2354633, at *21 (4th Cir. June 21, 2012).  Plaintiffs’ counsel therefore argue \nthat the holding in Logan v. Shealy is still controlling.  The difficulty is that the Supreme Court’s \nopinion in Florence not only overruled some aspects of Fourth Circuit law (on which this court \npreviously relied in denying the motion to dismiss) but in doing so left the contours of any \n“exception” that would apply to the plaintiffs in this case unclear and open to debate.  Simply \n9 \n \n\nput, “Florence erased any bright lines that previously existed in this area of Fourth Amendment \nlaw regarding searches in a detention facility.”  Wamble v. County of Jones, 2012 WL 2088820, \nat *15 (S.D. Miss. June 8, 2012).  Indeed, the divergence of opinions in the recent cases from \nother districts and circuits cited by both sides in their supplemental memoranda and letters \nunderscores the present lack of a clear test applicable to the specific circumstances of detention \npractices at CBIC during the years at issue in this litigation.8 \n  Accordingly, without addressing either the wisdom or the constitutionality of a blanket \nstrip search policy at CBIC (if such policy was in place), the court is constrained to grant the \nindividual defendant wardens’ motions for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified \nimmunity.   \nA separate Order follows. \n \n \n   \nMarch 5, 2013        /s/       \nDate              Catherine C. Blake \n        United  States District Judge  \n \n                                                            \n8  It is important to note this case does not involve a strip search at a station house or some other facility where \nsubstantial contact with other detainees can be avoided, nor does it involve touching of unclothed areas of the body \nby correctional officers. \n10 \n ",

Plaintiffs are male\narrestees placed in the Booking Center who complain of\nunconstitutional strip searches and unconstitutional detention\nfor 48 hours or more after arrest before presentment before a\ncommissioner or other judicial officer.  Defendants are the\nvarious wardens of the Booking Center, the Mayor and City Council\nand the Baltimore City Police Department.  \nBefore the Court is defendants’ motion for a protective\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 2 of 25\norder, seeking to prevent the disclosure of written advice\nprepared by the Office of the Maryland Attorney General (“OAG”)\nto the Division of Pretrial Detention and Services (“Division”),\nregarding Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center’s (“BCBIC”)\narrestee search practices. (Paper No. 168.) \nSpecifically, defendants seek protection for three\nmemoranda, prepared by the OAG for the Division within the past\ndecade. (Paper No. 168-2, 2.) These memoranda consist of:\n(i) a July 27, 2000 memorandum by Assistant Attorney \nGeneral (“AAG”) Glenn T. Marrow to then-Division\nCommissioner LaMont Flanagan re: “Blanket Strip Search\nPractice”; \n(ii) an October 16, 2002 memorandum by AAG Marrow to\nthen-Division Commissioner LaMont Flanagan re: “strip\nsearches,” with a copy provided to AAG Stuart M.\nNathan; and\n(iii) a December 5, 2005 memorandum by AAG Karl A.\nPothier to then-Division Commissioner William J. Smith\n“re: BCBIC’s Search Policy Regarding Pre-Presentment\nDetainees,” with copies provided to then-Deputy\nCommissioner Howard Ray, Deputy Commissioner Brown,\nWarden Franks, and AAGs Nathan and Judith A. Barr. \n(Paper No. 168-2, 2.)  The Court has reviewed the three memoranda\nin camera.\nDefendants assert that these memoranda are confidential,\ninter-office communications that contain the opinions and\nrecommendations of counsel regarding the scope of the Division’s\narrestee search practices; they seek protection for the documents\nunder two theories:  the attorney-client privilege and executive\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 3 of 25\nprivilege.  The plaintiffs dispute the privileged status of the\ndocuments.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that\nneither privilege applies to these documents and they must be\nproduced. \nDiscussion\nThe Attorney-Client Privilege\nThe purpose of the attorney-client privilege is “to\nencourage full and frank communications between attorneys and\ntheir clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the\nobservance of law and administration of justice.”  Upjohn Co. v.\nUnited States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).  The privilege is “not\nfavored by the federal courts” because it interferes with the\ntruth seeking process and contravenes the right of citizens to\nevidence, and should be “strictly confined within the narrowest\npossible limits consistent with the logic of its principle.” In\nre Grand Jury Proceedings, 727 F.2d 1352, 1355 (4th Cir. 1984).\nThe traditional test for determining the applicability of\nthe privilege was articulated by Judge Wyzanski in United States\nv. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 89 F. Supp. 357 (D. Mass. 1950):\nThe privilege applies only if:\n(1) the asserted holder of the privilege is\nor sought to become a client;\n(2) the person to whom the communication was\nmade (a) is a member of a bar of a court, or\nhis subordinate and (b) in connection with\nthis communication is acting as a lawyer;\n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 4 of 25\n(3) the communication relates to a fact of\nwhich the attorney was informed (a) by his\nclient (b) without the presence of strangers\n(c) for the purposes of securing primarily\neither (i) an opinion on law or (ii) legal\nservices or (iii) assistance in some legal\nproceeding, and not (d) for the purpose of\ncommitting a crime or tort; and\n(4) the privilege has been (a) claimed and\n(b) not waived by the client.\nId. at 358-59. See also In re Allen, 106 F.3d 582, 600 (4th Cir.\n1997) (applying the traditional test set out above). \nNeither the plaintiffs nor the Court question the existence\nof an attorney-client relationship between the OAG (the two AAGs\nwho authored the subject memoranda, Messrs. Glenn Marrow and Karl\nPothier) and the addressees LaMont Flanagan and William J. Smith,\nCommissioners of the Division.)  See MD. CODE ANN., CORR. SERVS. §\n2-116 (West 2008).  Thus, criteria (1) and (2) of United Shoe are\neasily  satisfied.  However, the fact of an attorney-client\nrelationship does not, of course, make all communications between\nan attorney and his client privileged.  Indeed, the law is quite\nto the contrary.  The third criterion of United Shoe is that “the\ncommunication relates to a fact of which the attorney was\ninformed (a) by his client, (b) without the presence of\nstrangers, (c) for the purpose of securing primarily either (i)\nan opinion on law, or (ii) legal services, or (iii) assistance in\nsome legal proceeding.” \nThe Fourth Circuit in United States v. (Under Seal), 748\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 5 of 25\nF.2d 871, 874 (4th Cir. 1984) establishes a very narrow view of\nthis aspect of the attorney-client privilege.\nBecause the privilege protects the substance\nof communications, it may also be extended to\nprotect communications by the lawyer to his\nclient, agents or superiors or to other\nlawyers in the case of joint representation,\nif those communications reveal confidential\ncommunications.\nId.  (emphasis added)\nThis decision places the Fourth Circuit clearly among the\n“strict construction courts” who “extend the privilege to legal\nopinions and communications from attorneys to clients only if\nand, arguably only to the extent, that the opinion contains\nwithin it, and arguably inextricably bound up to the legal\nopinion, the confidences made by the client to the lawyer that\nform the basis of the legal opinion.”  Epstein, Edna Selan, The\nAttorney-Client Privilege and the Work Product Doctrine 78 (5th\ned. 2007).  The defendants, however, argue that the privilege\n“encompasses communications from the attorney to the client,\nincluding ‘self initiated attorney communications intended to\nkeep the client posted on legal developments and trends,\nincluding implications of client activity noticed by the attorney\nbut with regard to which no written request for advice from the\nclient has been found,” quoting Jack Winter, Inc. v. Koratron\nCo., 54 F.R.D. 44, 46 (N.D. Cal. 1971), and citing Burlington\nIndus. v. Exxon Corp., 65 F.R.D. 26, 37 (D. Md. 1974).  (Paper\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 6 of 25\nNo. 214, 4.)  The Jack Winter holding, of course, represents a\nbroad construction of the privilege,1 firmly rejected in the 1984\nU.S. v. (Under Seal) decision.  The Fourth Circuit has never\ncited either Jack Winter or Burlington with approval on this\npoint.  Moreover, the defendants did not (and could not) find any\npost 1984 authority in the Fourth Circuit for such an expansive\nview of the attorney-client privilege.  Rather, as United States\nv. (Under Seal) makes clear,  lawyer communications at issue here\nare only privileged insofar as they reveal confidential client\ncommunications. 748 F.2d at 874.  \nThe burden is on the proponent of the privilege, here the\ndefendants, to demonstrate “not only that an attorney-client\nrelationship existed, but also that the particular communications\nat issue are privileged[(confidential)] and that the privilege\nwas not waived.” In Re: Grand Jury Subpoena, 341 F.3d 331, 335\n(4th Cir. 2003) (citing United States v. Jones, 696 F.2d 1069,\n1072 (4th Cir. 1982)); Accord United States v. Martin Marietta,\n886 F. Supp. 1243, 1244 (D. Md. 1995). \nAs the Fourth Circuit explained in United States v. (Under\nSeal), “[i]n practical terms, this burden requires the proponent\nto explain, through ex parte submissions if necessary to maintain\nconfidentiality, the significance or meaning of an otherwise\ncryptic document.” 748 F.2d 871, 876 (4th Cir. 1984).  When the\n1 See Epstein, 84.\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 7 of 25\nrequesting party challenges the sufficiency of the privilege\nassertion, the producing party bears the burden of establishing\nan evidentiary basis (such as an affidavit) to support each\nelement of each privilege or work product protection sought, for\neach document. Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe, Inc., ---\nF.Supp.2d ----, 2008 WL 2221841, *11 (D. Md. May 29, 2008).2  \nIn support of their assertions of privilege, the defendants\nsubmit two affidavits of Benjamin Brown, the current Deputy\nCommissioner3 for the Division of Pretrial Detention and\nServices.4  Deputy Commissioner Brown states that he “found the\n2 If the evidentiary basis is not established, the documents\nshould be produced.  Id. (“If...the requesting party challenges the\nsufficiency of the assertion of privilege/protection, the asserting\nparty ...bears the burden of establishing an evidentiary basis - by\naffidavit, deposition transcript, or other evidence - for each element\nof each privilege...claimed for each document or category of document.\nA failure to do so warrants a ruling that the documents must be\nproduced because of the failure of the asserting party to meet its\nburden.”). See also Neuberger Berman Real Estate Income Fund, Inc. v.\nLola Brown Trust No. 1B, 230 F.R.D. 398, 409-10 (D. Md. 2005);\nNeighborhood Dev. Collaborative v. Murphy, 233 F.R.D. 436, 442 (D. Md.\n2005); Byrnes v. Jetnet Corp., 111 F.R.D. 68, 71 (M.D.N.C. 1986)(“It\nis incumbent upon the proponent to specifically and factually support\nhis claim of privilege, usually by affidavit, to satisfy this burden,\nand an improperly asserted privilege is the equivalent of no privilege\nat all.”).\n3 The Deputy Commissioner gave the first affidavit “under\npenalties of perjury that the contents . . . are true to the best of\n[his] knowledge, information and belief”, (Paper No. 168-4) and the\nsecond affidavit “under penalties of perjury that the contents of this\nsupplemental affidavit are true to the best of my personal knowledge.” \n(Paper No. 214-2.)\n4 As Deputy Commissioner, a post he has occupied from May 2001 to\nSeptember 2003, he says his duties are the oversight of “the\nadministrative functions of the Division, including finance, human\nresources, procurement, technology and training” and “as needed and as\ndirected by the Division’s Commissioner, all other operations within\nthe Division, such as custody and security.”  (Paper No. 168-4, ¶ 1.) \n7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 8 of 25\ninformation contained [in the subject memoranda] to be strictly\nconfidential.”  (Paper No. 168-4, ¶ 4.)  He further states that\nthe memoranda are “interoffice communications that contain the\nopinions and recommendations of the Division’s attorneys, which\nthe Division sought as part of the Division’s ongoing\ndeliberative process in deciding what executive action, if any,\nwas appropriate with respect to the Division’s search practices\nof arrestees.”  (Id.)  Finally, Deputy Commissioner Brown\nconcludes that the “[p]roduction or disclosure of the memoranda\nwould be contrary to the public interest . . . thwart[ing] the\npolicy and decision-making process of the Division.”  (Id. at ¶\n5.)  In his supplemental affidavit, he further states that “[t]he\nCommissioner and the senior staff did not disseminate the\nmemoranda further down through the ranks of the Division’s\ncorrectional staff and non-uniform personnel, and, to the best of\nmy personal knowledge, this remains the case as of the date of\nthe instant Supplement.”  (Paper No. 214-2, ¶ 2.)  \nIt is the responsibility of the Court to construe the\nprivilege strictly, see In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 727 F.2d\n1352, 1356 (4th Cir. 1986); U.S. v. Jones, 696 F.2d 1069 (4th\nCir. 1982); and allow protection of documents only if specific\nrequirements are met.\nHe was Assistant Commissioner from September 2003 to January 2008. \n(Id.)  He does not, however, describe his duties as assistant\ncommissioner.\n8\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 9 of 25\nThese three memoranda set out the Assistant Attorney\nGeneral’s view of the law on strip searches, but none either\nexplicitly or even implicitly suggest that the advice is in\nresponse to a request for legal advice.  The memoranda bear one\nof the following: “ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION DO NOT DIVULGE\nTHE CONTENTS OF THIS MEMORANDUM TO ANYONE OTHER THAN THE\nADDRESSEE”, “ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION-DO NOT DISCLOSE THE\nCONTENTS OF THIS MEMORANDUM TO ANY PARTY OTHER THAN THE\nADDRESSEES”, or “CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT\nCOMMUNICATION.”  Two of these memoranda preface a legal opinion\nwith the writer’s “understanding” of the BCBIC current policy on\nstrip searches.  The third memorandum states the writer’s\ninformation as to “whether there is a blanket policy of visual\nstrip searches for all detainees who are processed at BCBIC.”  \nWhile the Deputy Commissioner states that the “opinions and\nrecommendations of the Division’s attorneys, which the Division\nsought as part of the Division’s ongoing deliberative process,”\nhe does not produce a written request seeking this advice or\nprovide the specific context for these memoranda of legal advice. \nObviously, the Deputy Commissioner is unable to testify if the\naddressees asked for the legal advice given in these three\nmemoranda or what confidential information, if any, the\naddressees gave the Assistant Attorneys General if legal advice\nwas requested.\n9\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 10 of 25\nThe Court rejects the applicability of the attorney-client\nprivilege as to all three memoranda.  First, and most\nimportantly, a review of the memoranda themselves and the limited\ncontext of the communications provided by Deputy Commissioner\nBrown does not indicate that any of these memoranda were the\nresult of a request for legal advice.  Even if it were assumed\nthat the legal advice in these memoranda were specifically\nrequested by Commissioner Flanagan or Commissioner Smith, that\ndoes not shield the entirety of the memoranda, whether requested\nor not.  The legal advice is not privileged; it is only the\nconfidential client communications that are.\nThe question remains whether the writer’s recitation of his\nunderstanding of the practice or policy of the Division regarding\nstrip searches is privileged.  The answer is no.  There is no\nfactual basis upon which to find that this information was\nprovided by the client and with the expectation of\nconfidentiality.  The source of the information and the\ncircumstances of its transmission to the Assistant Attorney\nGeneral writers is unknown.  The third criterion of United Shoe\nrequires that the communication (to be privileged) must be\ntransmitted to the attorney, by the client, without the presence\nof strangers for the purpose of securing a legal opinion or legal\nservices.  89 F. Supp. At 358-59. It is impossible to know how\nthe Assistant Attorney General writers came to their\n10\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 11 of 25\nunderstandings of the Division strip search policy practice. \nWhile Deputy Commissioner Brown concluded that the “information\ncontained [in the subject memoranda] to be strictly confidential\nin nature,” (Paper No. 168-4), that does not address, much less\ndemonstrate, that the strip search practice or policy information\nwas transmitted “confidentially,” i.e., from client to attorney,\nwithout the presence of strangers for the purpose of obtaining a\nlegal opinion or legal services.\nHaving reviewed the three memoranda at issue, they appear to\nbe initiated by the OAG -- not in response to any identified\ninquiry from the Commissioner and do not contain any confidential\nclient information.  The memoranda do contain a recitation of\ncurrent policy but that type of information seems by its nature\nnot confidential, nor was it characterized as such in the\nmemoranda.  Nor - as discussed above - did the defendants provide\nany factual support that the information was gathered from the\nclient, in confidence and  maintained in confidence.  The Deputy\nCommissioner’s statement in his supplemental affidavit that these\nmemoranda were treated as “wholly confidential” and were not\ndisseminated beyond the Division’s senior administrative staff\n“through the ranks of the Division’s correctional staff and non-\nuniform personnel,” (Paper No. 214-2, ¶ 2) is highly conclusory. \nHe produces neither a  written policy to that effect or a\ndescription of procedures to guarantee such confidentiality, such\n11\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 12 of 25\nas locations where documents found, etc.  Finally, it is not\nnecessarily clear from his described duties as Deputy\nCommissioner that he would be in a position to know document\ncontrol procedures.  In any event, the Division’s treatment of\nthem as confidential is only one of the criteria for privilege;\nthe rest have not been met.  In sum, these memoranda enjoy no\nprivilege under governing Fourth Circuit law.\nThe Executive or Deliberative Privilege\nHere, defendants argue that the memoranda are protected by\nthe executive privilege - generated by the OAG to the Division’s\nCommissioner, to aid him in his deliberations regarding the\nsearch practices of arrestees at BCBIC.5 (Paper No. 168-2, 5-\n5 Both parties cite Maryland and federal law in discussing this\nprivilege. In Hamilton v. Verdow, this Court certified to the Court of\nAppeals of Maryland the question of whether an investigative report\nwas protected by the executive privilege. 414 A.2d 914 (1980) The\nCourt of Appeals noted that “the relevance of Maryland law regarding\nprivilege stems from the provisions of Rule 501, Federal Rules of\nEvidence, which provides: \nExcept as otherwise required by the Constitution of the\nUnited States or provided by Act of Congress or in rules\nprescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory\nauthority, the privilege of a witness, person, government,\nState, or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by\nthe principles of the common law as they may be interpreted\nby the courts of the United States in the light of reason\nand experience. However, in civil actions and proceedings,\nwith respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which\nState law supplies the rule of decision, the privilege of a\nwitness, person, government, State, or political subdivision\nthereof shall be determined in accordance with State law.”\nId. at 918 n.2. Hamilton, however, was before the federal court by\ndiversity jurisdiction. Id. at 917. Because state law supplied the\nrule of decision in that case, the government’s claim of executive\nprivilege was properly decided in accordance with Maryland law. \n12\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 13 of 25\n6.)\nThe executive or deliberative-process privilege6 exists to\nprotect the governmental decision-making process.7  It protects\nWhere the claim is before a federal court by federal question\njurisdiction, however, state privilege law does not automatically\ngovern. Fed. R. Evid. 501. See United States v. Cartledge, 928 F.2d\n93, 95-96 (4th Cir. 1991) (agreeing that “a federal court is not\nnecessarily bound by a state rule of law creating an evidentiary\nprivilege”); Hartsell v. Duplex Prods., Inc., 895 F. Supp. 100, 102\n(W.D.N.C. 1995) (“State statutory privileges do not automatically\napply to federal claims in federal court.”). Cf. United States v.\nTedder, 801 F.2d 1437, 1441 (4th Cir. 1986) (“Rule 501 of the Federal\nRules of Evidence requires federal courts to apply federal common law\nto assertions of privilege in criminal cases.”). In federal question\ncases, “a court must determine whether federal and state law conflict\nover the privilege at issue.” Hartsell, 895 F. Supp. at 102. Where the\nprivileges conflict, Fourth Circuit law dictates that courts balance\nthe competing federal interests and principles of comity to determine\nwhich law controls the federal claim. Cartledge, 928 F.2d at 96; see\nalso Hartsell, 895 F. Supp. at 102 (applying the principles set out in\nCartledge in a civil action under Title VII). \nThe executive privilege in Maryland is substantially similar to\nthe privilege under federal law. Compare Hamilton, 414 A.2d at 558\n(“The necessity for some protection from disclosure clearly extends to\nconfidential advisory and deliberative communications between\nofficials and those who assist them in formulating and deciding upon\nfuture governmental action.”) with Greene, 93 F.R.D. at 659 and Carl\nZeiss, 40 F.R.D. at 324 (discussed in main text above). See also \nHamilton, 414 A.2d at 921-26 (relying on federal law, including Carl\nZeiss, in determining the bounds of executive privilege under Maryland\nlaw).  Thus, because the state and federal laws of executive privilege\ndo not conflict, this Court has applied federal law to the privilege\nissues in this federal question litigation.\n6 The terms “executive” and “deliberative process” are used\ninterchangeably to describe the same executive privilege to withhold\ndocuments and information.  Wright & Graham, Federal Practice and\nProcedure: Evidence § 5680; see also N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.,\n421 U.S. 132 (1975); Hanson v. U.S. Agency for Int’l Dev., 372 F.3d\n286 (4th Cir. 2004).\n7 The privilege reflects the conviction that certain governmental\ndecisions must be made in confidence to be effective.  Greene v.\nThalhimer’s Dep’t Store, 93 F.R.D. 657, 659 (E.D. Va. 1982); see also\nSears Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. at 150 (noting that “[t]he point,\nplainly made...is that the ‘frank discussion of legal or policy\nmatters' in writing might be inhibited if the discussion were made\n13\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 14 of 25\nfrom disclosure advice, opinions and recommendations that are\npart of the decision-making process; the goal is “to prevent\ninjury to the quality of agency decisions.”  N.L.R.B. v. Sears,\nRoebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 151 (1975).8  Specifically, “three\npolicy purposes have consistently been held to constitute the\nbases for this privilege:”\n1) to encourage open, frank discussions on\npublic; and that the ‘decisions’ and ‘policies formulated’ would be\nthe poorer as a result); Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. V.E.B. Carl Zeiss,\nJena, 40 F.R.D. 318, 324 (D.D.C. 1966) (finding that “the privilege\nsubserves a preponderation policy of frank expression and discussion\namong those upon whom rests the responsibility for making the\ndeterminations that enable government to operate”). The privilege\n“shields from disclosure ‘intra-governmental documents reflecting\nadvisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part\nof a process by which governmental decisions and policies are\nformulated.’” Greene, 93 F.R.D. at 659 (quoting Carl Zeiss, 40 F.R.D.\nat 324).\n8 The deliberative process privilege has been specifically\nincorporated into the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) as an\nexception.  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).  Much of the federal case law\ndiscussing the privilege does so within the FOIA context.  Maryland\nhas its own Public Information Act, and has incorporated a\ndeliberative process privilege exception as well.  The Maryland\nAttorney General’s Public Information Act Manual states:  \nAnother example of information protected by a\nrecognized privilege is confidential executive\ncommunications of an advisory or deliberative\nnature. See Office of the Governor v. Washington\nPost Co., 360 Md. 520, 759 A.2d 249 (2000);\nHamilton v. Verdow, 287 Md. 544, 414 A.2d 914\n(1980); Laws v. Thompson, 78 Md. App. 665, 690-\n93, 554 A.2d 1264 (1989); 66 Opinions of the\nAttorney General 98 (1981). Not every executive\ncommunication is itself advisory or deliberative.\nOffice of the Maryland Attorney General, Public Information Act\nManual, (December, 2000) available at www.oag.state.md.us/Forms/book.\npdf.  The parallel suggests that Maryland considers its executive\nprivilege to be the same, or similar to the federal deliberative-\nprocess privilege.\n14\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 15 of 25\nmatter of policy between subordinates and\nsuperiors; 2) to protect against premature\ndisclosure of proposed policies before they\nare finally adopted; and 3) to protect\nagainst public confusion that might result\nfrom disclosure of reasons and rationales\nthat were not in fact ultimately the grounds\nfor an agency’s action.\nJustin D. Franklin et al., Guidebook to The Freedom of\nInformation and Privacy Acts § 1:57 (2008); see also Sears,\nRoebuck & Co., 421 U.S. at 151.  The pivotal question is:\n“whether the materials bear on the formulation or exercise of\nagency policy-oriented judgment ...[and] whether disclosure would\ntend to diminish candor within an agency.”  City of Va. Beach v.\nU.S. Dep’t Of Commerce, 995 F.2d 1247, 1254 (4th Cir.\n1993)(internal citations omitted).  “This privilege...must be\nconstrued as narrowly as consistent with efficient Government\noperation.”  Wolfe v. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 839 F.2d\n768, 773 (D.C. Cir. 1988)(internal quotations omitted).\n  There are two traditional requirements for invocation of the\nprivilege:  that the communication be 1) predecisional, i.e.,\n“antecedent to the adoption of an agency policy...,” and 2)\ndeliberative, i.e., “a direct part of the deliberative process in\nthat it makes recommendations or expresses opinions on legal or\npolicy matters.” Franklin, supra, § 1:57 (internal citations\nomitted); see also City of Va. Beach.\nFor a communication to be predecisional, it does not have to\nbe anchored to a specific, discrete, final decision.  In Sears,\n15\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 16 of 25\nRoebuck & Co., the Supreme Court noted that:\nOur  emphasis  on  the  need  to  protect  pre-\ndecisional documents does not mean that the\nexistence  of  the  privilege  turns  on  the\nability of an agency to identify a specific\ndecision in connection with which a memorandum\nis prepared. Agencies are, and properly should\nbe,  engaged  in  a  continuing  process  of\nexamining their policies; this process will\ngenerate memoranda containing recommendations\nwhich do not ripen into agency decisions; and\nthe lower courts should be wary of interfering\nwith this process.\n421 U.S. at 153; Accord City of Va.

United States Dep’t of Commerce, 968 F.2d 916, 921\n(9th Cir. 1992)(“Any memorandum always will be ‘predecisional’ if\n[referenced] to a decision that possibly may be made at some\nundisclosed time in the future.”) and Coastal States, 617 F.2d at\n868 (“characterizing these documents as ‘predecisional’ simply\nbecause they play into an ongoing audit process would be a\n16\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 17 of 25\nserious warping of the meaning of the word.”).  The Court in City\nof Va. Beach determined that certain documents were privileged,\nbut only because they were drafted in conjunction with pending\nproceedings, antecedent to an identifiable outcome.  995 F.2d at\n1255.\nEvidence of the use of the subject document as a basis for\ndiscussion, prior to making a final decision, is considered a\nsign of its pre-decisional nature.  In Renegotiation Board v.\nGrumman Aircraft, 421 U.S. 168, 185 (1975), the reports were\nprepared by regional boards; they assessed whether government\ncontractors had received excessive profits.  Id.  The reports\nwere submitted to a higher board, with final decisionmaking\nauthority, which used the regional board reports as a basis for\ndiscussion before making a final decision.  Id.  The Supreme\nCourt noted that the “reports were prepared long before the Board\nreached its decision...,” and considered that important in\ndetermining that the reports were predecisional.   Id.  \nLikewise, in City of Va. Beach, the documents - aimed at\ndetermining whether and how to build a water pipeline - were\ndrafted in conjunction with judicial and administrative\nproceedings where final decisions were anticipated.  995 F.2d at\n1249-50. \nUnder the narrow construction of the privilege, legal\nmemoranda - relied upon by recipients as statements of law and\n17\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 18 of 25\npublic policy - have not been found to be “predecisional.”  The\nD.C. Circuit in Tax Analysts v. Internal Revenue Service, dealt\nwith legal memoranda strikingly similar to those at issue in the\ninstant case.  117 F.3d 607 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  The documents were\nlabeled Field Service Advice Memoranda (“FSAs”), and they were\nissued by the Office of the Chief Counsel for the IRS to field\npersonnel.  Id. at 608-09.  As in this case, the memoranda were\nintended to ensure “that field personnel apply the law correctly\nand uniformly,” but nonetheless were not binding upon the field\npersonnel.  Id.  The Court opined that the FSA’s were routinely\nused by field personnel, who while not bound, rely heavily on the\nFSAs as statements of law.  Id. at 617.  “Rather than documents\nproduced in the process of formulating policy, FSAs are\nthemselves statements of an agency’s legal position and, as such,\ncannot be viewed as predecisional.”  Id.  While “FSAs may\nprecede...[decisions] in a particular taxpayer’s case, they do\nnot precede the decision regarding the agency’s legal position. \nRepresenting the considered view of the Chief Counsel’s national\noffice on significant tax law issues, FSAs do not reflect the\n“give and take” that characterizes deliberative materials.”  Id.\nAs to the memoranda here, there is no indication that they\nwere antecedent to a particular decision, nor part of a\ndeliberative process intended to lead to a final result, or\narrive at a final conclusion.  Instead, they were sua sponte\n18\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 19 of 25\nstatements of law, and assessments of existing policy.  In short,\nthese memoranda lack that crucial characteristic shared by the\ndocuments in Gruman and Virginia Beach: a connection with an\nanticipated final outcome.  Moreover, they are strikingly similar\nto the FSAs in Tax Analysts, in that they are legal memoranda,\nstating a legal position on existing policies, relied upon by the\npersonnel who receive them.  Under Tax Analysts, such documents\nare simply not predecisional.  The Court Circuit in Virginia\nBeach warned against an “overly lax” construction of the term\n“predecisional;” the Court cannot determine that the OAG\nmemoranda fall within that category.  To label the memoranda\n“predecisional” would be to “submerge the rule of disclosure\nunder the exemption.”  Id.  If these memoranda are found\n“predecisional” any legal memoranda on any subject in a state\nofficial’s portfolio would qualify.  The privilege is not that\nbroad.  \nNeither are the memoranda part of a deliberative give-and-\ntake to qualify for the privilege.  Deliberative material\n“reflects the give-and-take of the consultative process...by\nrevealing the manner in which the agency evaluates possible\nalternative policies or outcomes.”  City of Va. Beach, 995 F.2d\nat 1253 (internal citations omitted).  The Fourth Circuit has\nadopted the give-and-take test to determine whether documents are\ndeliberative; thus, the deliberative-process privilege protects\n19\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 20 of 25\nconversational documents - those intended to fuel a dialogue:\n“recommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and\nother subjective documents” that reflect personal opinion.  Id.\n(Internal citations omitted).  There was an actual back-and-forth\nin the documents in City of Va. Beach among agencies and parties,\nover the implications of a water pipeline system.  \nThat back-and-forth is critical to a determination that\ndocuments and communications are deliberative.  See, e.g., Access\nReports v. Dep’t of Justice, 926 F.2d 1192, 1195 (D.C. Cir.\n1991)(stating that a document is deliberative if it “reflects the\ngive-and-take of the consultative process”)(internal citations\nomitted); see also Tax Analysts, 117 F.3d at 617 (“FSAs do not\nreflect the give-and-take that characterizes deliberative\nmaterials, [the] government’s opinion about what is not the law\nand why it is not the law is as much a statement of government\npolicy as its opinion about what the law is.”).  Simple\nstatements of law, or evaluations of existing policies, do not\nenjoy the characteristics of that give-and-take process necessary\nto make them deliberative.   \nThe D.C. Circuit, in Coastal States v. Department of Energy,\ndealt with legal memoranda prepared by Department of Energy\nCounsel, interpreting DOE regulations for field personnel.  617\nF.2d 854, 857 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  The memoranda were, as in Tax\nAnalysts, not strictly binding on field personnel, but were\n20\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 21 of 25\nresponses to requests for guidance on the applicability of\nregulations to a set of facts.  The Court in Coastal States\nstated that such memoranda are “more akin to a resource opinion\nabout the applicability of existing policy to a certain state of\nfacts[;] they [do not] reflect agency give-and-take of the\ndeliberative process by which the decision itself is made.”  Id.\nat 868 (internal citations omitted).  Contrarily, the documents\nat issue in Virginia Beach were part of a give-and-take where\nindividuals and agencies exchanged opinions and concerns over the\nproposed water pipeline project.  995 F.2d at 1250.  “The role\nplayed by the documents in issue” during the process largely\ndetermines whether the documents are predecisional and\ndeliberative.  Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 868. \nThe OAG memoranda do not reflect a give-and-take process. \nThey are statements of law rather than contributions to the\nformulation of agency policies.  There is no indication the\nmemoranda were preceded by a request, or that responses were\nelicited for use in some meeting or other forum.  They are not\nlike the City of Va. Beach documents, which were part of a\nbroader dialogue taking place among various parties.    \nFinally, the memoranda did not travel from subordinate to\nsuperior and were more akin to binding advice than suggestive or\nadvisory recommendations.  One of the main policy justifications\nfor the privilege is to protect open and frank discussions\n21\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 22 of 25\nbetween subordinates and superiors.  Environmental Protection\nAgency v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 87 (1973).  The D.C. Circuit in\nPuerto Rico noted that the pertinent “case law . . . identifies\ntwo factors in determining whether this privilege is available:\n“the nature of the decisionmaking authority vested in the officer\nor person issuing the disputed document, and the relative\npositions in the agency’s ‘chain of command’ occupied by the\ndocument’s author and recipient.”  (internal citations omitted.) \nHere, the Assistant Attorneys General cannot be properly\ncharacterized as subordinate to the Commissioner.  The Attorney\nGeneral is the legal adviser to the Department of Correctional\nServices, but the Office of the Attorney General also has\n“general charge of the legal business of the State.”  MD. CODE\nANN., STATE GOV’T, § 6-106 (West 2008).  Courts have recognized\nthat legal memoranda from counsel to client are qualitatively\ndifferent than the “recommendations, draft documents, proposals,\nsuggestions and other subjective documents which reflect the\npersonal opinions of the writer.”  City of Va. Beach, 995 F.2d at\n1253.  Lawyers operate in a different sphere, offering something\ndifferent than simply another view on appropriate policy.  \nOAG opinions are more than advisory, and carry more weight\nthan mere recommendations.  As already mentioned above, the Court\nin Tax Analysts opined that even though legal memoranda were not\nstrictly binding upon the recipients, the fact that field\n22\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 23 of 25\npersonnel regularly followed the advice contained in the FSA’s\nsuggested the documents were not predecisional or deliberative. \n117 F.3d at 608-09.  Courts often look “beneath formal lines of\nauthority to the reality of the decisionmaking process...” to\ndetermine where authority lies, and how often “recommendations”\nare complied with.  Schlefer v. United States , 702 F.2d 233, 238\n(D.C. Cir. 1983).  In Schlefer, legal memoranda titled CCOs were\ncreated by the Chief Counsel of the Maritime Administration, and\ngiven to Maritime Administration officials who requested the\nadvice.  Id. at 236.  Decisionmaking authority technically\nremained with those requesting advice.  Id. at 237.  But the\nCourt opined that the agency “failed to demonstrate that the\nChief Counsel merely “advises” requesting officials on” legal\nmatters.  Id. at 241.  Similarly, the OAG memoranda are legal\nmemoranda - statements of law - which are more than mere\nsuggestions; they represent the legal position of the Attorney\nGeneral, and thus, the state, on legal issues.  Review of the\nmemoranda demonstrates that the AAGs were not offering their\npersonal view on a policy question; rather they were offering a\nstraightforward legal opinion to a non-lawyer, agency official. \nThat agency official would ignore this legal opinion at his\nperil.  \nIn his affidavit, Mr. Brown declares that “[t]he memoranda .\n. . [were] sought as part of the Division’s ongoing deliberative\n23\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 24 of 25\nprocess in deciding what executive action, if any, was\nappropriate with respect to the Division’s search practices of\narrestees.”  (Paper No. 168-4, 2.)  But a careful review of the\ndocuments has not convinced the Court that they are predecisional\nand deliberative.  They are not antecedent to an particular\ndecision, nor part of a particular policy process.  They are not\npart of an internal discussion, or back-and-forth intended to\narrive at a conclusion.  They are not from a subordinate to a\nsuperior, despite the fact that the recipient agency may retain\ndecisionmaking authority.  “The privilege protects\nrecommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and\nother subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of\nthe writer rather than the policy of the agency.”  Allnutt v.\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, 2000 WL 852455, at *10 (D. Md. Oct. 23,\n2005).  The memoranda absolutely do not fall into that category\nof deliberative documents.  Instead, they constitute the\nconsidered view of a sister agency on the law.  While the Court\nrecognizes the need for the OAG to engage in ongoing\ncommunications with its state agency clients, all of its\ncommunications are not privileged.  The executive or deliberate\nprivilege, like the attorney-client privilege is to be narrowly\nconstrued.  These communications do not meet the test. \nAccordingly, neither privilege applies and defendants shall\n24\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 237   Filed 11/26/08   Page 25 of 25\nproduce the memoranda to plaintiffs no later than December 5,\n2008.\nDespite the informal nature of this letter, it will\nconstitute an Order of the Court and will be docketed\naccordingly.  \nSincerely yours,\n/s/\nSusan K. Gauvey\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n25",

Plaintiffs Eric Jones and Dana West bring this class action lawsuit on \nbehalf of themselves and all other male arrestees who (1) were subjected to \nstrip searches while being held in the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake \nCenter (“Booking Center”), waiting for presentment before a commissioner or \nother judicial officer on (a) misdemeanors not involving a weapon or drugs, or \n(b) non-violent, non-drug related felony charge(s); or (2) were subjected to strip, \nvisual body cavity and/or squat searches not conducted in private; or (3) were \nsubjected to blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches while \nbeing held in the Booking Center, waiting for presentment before a judge or \nother judicial officer of the City of Baltimore regardless of the charges against \n  2\n\nthem because similarly situated women were not subjected to such searches.   \n2.  Plaintiff Eric Jones also brings this class action on behalf of himself and \nall other persons who were arrested in the City of Baltimore but were not \nbrought before a commissioner or other judicial officer within 48 hours of their \narrest.  \nClasses \n3.  Plaintiffs move the Court to declare four separate classes, as described \nbelow. As used herein, “presentment” refers to the initial proceeding before the \nCourt referred to in Maryland Rule 4-212(f).  The time period for all classes is \nfrom May 12, 2002 through final judgment in this case. \n4.  Plaintiffs Dana West and Eric Jones and the class of persons they seek to \nrepresent (the “Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class”) are arrestees \narrested on (a) misdemeanors not involving a weapon or drugs, or (b) non-\nviolent, non-drug related felony charge(s) who were subjected to strip searches \nwithout any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that they were \nconcealing drugs, weapons or other contraband, by employees of the Booking \nCenter, while they were held in the Booking Center waiting for presentment \nbefore a commissioner or other judicial officer.  \n5.  The “Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class Members” are not (prior \nto presentment) commingled with persons who have been ordered detained at \nthe Baltimore City Detention Center (either because they could not post a bond \n  3\n\nor are held without bond). \n6.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class Members base their claims \non the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits \nsubjecting persons arrested on crimes not involving weapons or drugs to strip \nsearches without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable \ncause that the person was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. \n7.  Plaintiffs Dana West and Eric Jones also seek to represent a class of \narrestees (the “Non-Private Strip Search Class”) who were subjected to strip, \nvisual body cavity and/or squat searches by employees of the Booking Center \nin the presence of other arrested persons while they were held in the Booking \nCenter waiting for presentment before a commissioner or other judicial officer. \n8.  The Non-Private Strip Search Class Members base their claims on the \nFourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits \nsubjecting persons to strip searches in a non-private setting. The Non-Private \nStrip Search Class includes all persons who were strip-searched regardless of \nthe offense on which they were arrested because it is the manner of the search, \nrather than the lack of reasonable suspicion, that makes the search \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \n9.  Plaintiffs Dana West and Eric Jones additionally seek to represent a \nclass (the “Equal Protection Strip Search Class”) of persons who are male \narrestees arrested on all types of charges, including drug and violent offenses, \nwho were subjected to strip, visual body cavity and/or squat searches, by \n  4\n\nemployees of the Booking Center, while they were held in the Booking Center \nwaiting for presentment before a commissioner or other judicial officer.  \nDefendants subject male arrestees to such searches, but do not subject \nsimilarly situated female arrestees, including women charged with drug and \nviolent offenses, to the searches.  \n10.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Class Members base their claims on \nthe equal protection component of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution, which prohibits treating similarly situated men and \nwomen differently based on their gender. The Equal Protection Strip Search \nClass includes all men who were strip-searched, regardless of the offense on \nwhich they were arrested, because it is the application of the search to men but \nnot women, rather than the lack of reasonable suspicion, that makes the \nsearch unreasonable under the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n11.  Plaintiff Eric Jones also seeks to represent a class (the “Untimely \nPresentment Detention Class”) of persons who were arrested in the City of \nBaltimore and held at the Booking Center for more than 48 hours after their \narrest without presentment.  \n12.  The Untimely Presentment Detention Class Members base their claims \non the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which requires a \nprompt presentment such as the one afforded by Maryland Rule 4-212(f), and \ncreates a presumption of unreasonability and unconstitutionality if the pre-\npresentment detention exceeds 48 hours.   \n  5\n\n13.  This action is brought, individually and on behalf of the Classes, against \nMitchell Franks, Susan Murphy, and William Jednorski in their individual \ncapacities, and against the Government of the City of Baltimore and the \nBaltimore City Police Department, pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for damages and enforcement of their Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n14.  This action is brought by the Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the \nClasses, against Mitchell Franks, Susan Murphy, and William Jednorski in \ntheir official capacities as Wardens of the Booking Center, pursuant to Section \n1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and against the \nGovernment of the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police Department, \nfor prospective injunctive relief to enforce their Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights. \nJurisdiction And Venue \n15.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) because plaintiffs’ claims are based on Section \n1983 and the Constitution. \n16.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  The claim for relief arose from \nevents and occurrences in this judicial district. \nParties-Plaintiffs \n17. Plaintiff Dana T. West was arrested by an officer of the Baltimore City \n  6\n\nPolice Department on January 13, 2005 on a charge of leaving the scene of an \naccident. \n18. The Baltimore City Police Department, through its officer, placed Plaintiff \nDana T. West into the custody of the Booking Center on January 13, 2005. \n19. Plaintiff Dana T. West was strip searched in the Booking Center before \npresentment. \n20. Plaintiff Dana T. West is a male. \n21. Plaintiff Dana T. West was strip searched in the presence of other arrestees. \n22. Plaintiff Dana T. West was released directly from the Booking Center after \nposting a bond.  \n23. Plaintiff Dana T. West has standing to seek future injunctive relief because \nhe is reasonably likely to be re-admitted to the Booking Center. \n24. Plaintiff Eric Jones was arrested on January 10, 2005, on charges of 2nd \nDegree Assault and False Imprisonment. \n25. The Baltimore City Police Department, through its officer, placed Plaintiff \nEric Jones into the custody of the Booking Center on January 10, 2005. \n26. Plaintiff Eric Jones was strip searched in the Booking Center before \npresentment. \n27. Plaintiff Eric Jones is a male. \n  7\n\n28. Plaintiff Eric Jones was strip searched in the presence of other arrestees.  \n29. Plaintiff Eric Jones was held for more than 48 hours before his \npresentment. \n30. Plaintiff Eric Jones was released directly from the Booking Center after \nposting a bond. \n31. Plaintiff Jones has standing to seek future injunctive relief because he is \nreasonably likely to be re-admitted to the Booking Center. \nParties-Defendants \n32.  Defendant Mitchell Franks has been warden of the Booking Center since \nJuly 6, 2005.  He is sued in his official and individual capacities.  The section \n1983 claim against him in his official capacity is for prospective injunctive relief \nonly.   \n33.  Defendant Susan Murphy was acting warden of the Booking Center \nbeginning March 2004 and official warden from July 2004 until July 6, 2005. \nDefendant Susan Murphy was an assistant warden at the Booking Center for \nseveral years before being appointed Warden.  She is sued in her official and \nindividual capacities.  The section 1983 claim against her in her official \ncapacity is for prospective injunctive relief only.   \n34.  Defendant William Jednorski was warden of the Booking Center from \nMay 12, 2002 until March 2004.  He is sued in his official and individual \ncapacities.  The section 1983 claim against him in his official capacity is for \n  8\n\nprospective injunctive relief only.  \n35.  Because Defendants Mitchell Franks, Susan Murphy, and William \nJednorski were wardens responsible for the operation of the Booking Center at \ndifferent times, certain allegations are made herein with reference to the “the \nWarden.”  Such allegations refer to each of these Defendants for the time \nperiod during which he or she was warden. \n36.  At all times described herein, Defendants Mitchell Franks, Susan \nMurphy, and William Jednorski were acting under color of state law. \n37.  At all times described herein, Defendants Mitchell Franks, Susan \nMurphy, and William Jednorski were acting within the scope of his and her \nemployment. \n38.  Wherever in this Complaint the “Booking Center” may be alleged to have \ndone or not done an act, or had or lacked a policy or practice, such allegation \nis intended as an allegation against the respective Warden, and done by him or \nher or caused by his or her acts, policies, and practices, or lack thereof. \n39.  Defendant Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (“City of Baltimore”) is a \nmunicipal corporation with power to sue or be sued in any court. \n40.  The Baltimore City Police Department is a local government entity under \nSection 1983. The Baltimore City Police Department is subject to the control of \nthe City of Baltimore for the functions described herein.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n  9\n\nThe Booking Center \n41.  The Baltimore Central Booking and Central Intake Center opened in \n1995 as the central location for booking and processing arrestees in Baltimore \nCity.   \n42.  The Booking Center is an agency of the Division of Pretrial Detention and \nServices, which in turn is a division of the Maryland Department of Public \nSafety and Correctional Services. \n43.  The Division of Pretrial Detention and Services has jurisdiction over three \nagencies which handle the booking, processing, custody and control of \nBaltimore City arrestees:  \n  a.  The Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center (“Booking \nCenter”); \n  b.  The Baltimore City Detention Center (“Detention Center”); and \n  c.  The Pretrial Release Service Program. \n44.  Approximately 100,000 arrestees are processed yearly in this \ninternationally recognized center.  \n45.  The Booking Center is not a detention center where persons are held \npending trial or in a post conviction stage, though some persons detained and \nawaiting trial, while waiting for space at the Detention Center, may remain at \nthe Booking Center temporarily and separately housed from pre-presentment \n  10\n\narrestees.  \n46.  The Baltimore City Detention Center is the pretrial detention facility for \npersons arrested in the City of Baltimore and detained while awaiting trial. \n47.   The Detention Center is in a separate building from the Booking Center. \n48.  In the City of Baltimore, persons arrested by the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment are taken by the police to the Booking Center for booking and \nprocessing.   \n49.  The Booking Center contains a central booking unit, a medical unit, a \nclassification unit, records unit, court commissioner's offices, video bail \nfacilities, and a computerized Arrest Booking System.  \n50.  The Arrest Booking System provides fingerprint based identification of \noffenders utilizing Live Scan fingerprint technology, coupled with the State of \nMaryland's Automated Fingerprint Identification System. \n51.  The Live Scan system employs technology that enables a positive \nidentification of persons, that is, an identification based on the unique, \nbiometric characteristic of fingerprints. \n52.  Many persons taken to the Booking Center are arrestees who are brought \nin on very minor charges that could have been processed through citations (a \ncitation is an order by a police officer to appear in court on a specified date \nwithout an arrest).  \n  11\n\n53.  Police officials have identified the use of citations as one way to reduce \nthe number of minor offenders who end up at the Booking Center.  \n54.  About 20 percent of the people whom city police arrest, and commit to \nthe Booking Center, not including those picked up on warrants, never even \nface charges, such as where prosecutors determine that there is not enough \nevidence to support a charge, or that the alleged wrongdoing, such as loitering, \nwas abated by the arrest, and “decline” the case, that is, decline to prosecute \nthe case.  From March 2004 through March 2005, 21,893 arrestees of 103,675 \nwere released from the Booking Center without charge. \n55.  Persons arrested in warrantless arrests are held at the Booking Center \nfollowing arrest until their presentment before a commissioner for a probable \ncause determination, bail determination, appointment of counsel and other \nreasons.     \n56.  Persons who are ordered detained before trial, or who are ordered held \npending posting of bond, are held in the Booking Center before being \n“committed” to the “Towers,” that is, the Baltimore City Detention Center.   \n57.  Persons ordered released at presentment are segregated from the \n“committed” persons in separate holding areas pending release.   \n58.  Persons ordered committed at presentment are held separately from both \npersons awaiting presentment, and persons ordered released at presentment. \n59.  In 2000, the Booking Center processed 66,541 male arrestees and \n  12\n\n15,854 female arrestees.  Of the 82,395 people processed, 38,123 were released \non their own recognizance.  Currently, more than 100,000 arrestees are \nprocessed at the Booking Center annually. Upon information and belief, the \ngender and personal recognizance release percentages have approximately \ncontinued to the present time. \n60.  The Booking Center was designed to process up to 45,000 arrestees \nannually. \n61.  The Booking Center has no effective management system for booking and \nprocessing arrestees.  \n62.  The Booking Center does not maintain and update its computerized \nbooking and inmate management systems and has allowed its booking and \nprocessing and inmate management systems to collapse. \n63.  The wardens have maintained a policy and practice of maintaining a \npresentment and detention policy that simply delays all presentments and \ndetains arrestees until the system, in its sweet time, and with the resources it \nchooses, is ready to make presentments. \n64.  The fact that the Booking Center has no effective booking or inmate \nmanagement system has been documented by a series of reports and \nnewspaper articles, as well as by court cases dating back many years.  At the \nextreme end, the fundamental dysfunction and mismanagement of the Booking \nCenter led to the May 2005 beating death by guards of a 52-year-old man \n  13\n\ndetained on a $150.00 bond.   \n65.  The City of Baltimore has described the Booking Center as \n“dysfunctional” and lacking “appropriate or adequate management systems \nand practices to assure performance and accountability.”  COMPLAINT OF THE \nMAYOR AND CITY OF BALTIMORE, filed against Warden Susan Murphy, Rodney et \nal. v. Murphy, Circuit Court for Baltimore City, 24-C-05-004405, ¶¶ 8-9 (June \n29, 2005). \n66.  The overcrowding, overdetentions, and premature releases are a \nlongstanding, pervasive and continuing problem known to defendants. \n67.  The detention of arrestees is currently governed partly by a temporary \nrestraining order issued in the case of Richard Rodney et al. v. Susan Murphy, \nCircuit Court for Baltimore City, case number 24-C-05004405.  The Order \nrequires the warden of the Booking Center to present each arrested person to a \njudicial officer no later than 24 hours after arrest, and to release any arrested \nperson upon their being held for more than 24 hours without presentment, \nsubject to the warden’s right to move the court for continued detention upon a \nshowing of good cause.  The Order expires November 9, 2005.  The Order does \nnot address the strip searching of arrested persons. \nThe Warden’s Responsibilities For Inmates \nAt The Booking Center \n \n95.  The Warden’s duties include training, supervising, and disciplining \nBooking Center staff. \n  14\n\n96.  The Warden’s duties also include formulating, implementing, and \nexecuting policies concerning the operation of the Booking Center facilities.  \n97.  These duties include promulgating and implementing policies controlling \nthe strip searches of inmates, and promulgating and implementing policies \nensuring the prompt presentment and release of inmates following their initial \nappearances.  \n98.  The Warden has day-to-day training, supervisory, and disciplinary \nauthority for all operations of the Booking Center. \n99.  The Warden is also responsible for ensuring that each employee of the \nBooking Center discharges his or her duties in accordance with the law and \ncourt orders. \nThe Booking Center Practice Of Strip Searching Arrestees \n100.  As used herein, “strip search” includes the removal, pulling down, or \nrearrangement of clothing for the visual inspection of an arrested person’s \ngenital and/or anal areas, which may also include requiring the person to \nsquat and cough, in the presence of guards and other inmates. \n101.  The Booking Center has and has had informal practices of strip \nsearching men in situations where similarly-situated women are not strip \nsearched; of strip searching men arrested for crimes not commonly associated \nwith the possession of weapons or drugs; and of strip searching persons in the \npresence of other arrested persons. \n  15\n\n102.  Staff at the Booking Center subject virtually all men to strip searches \nbefore presentment without individualized reasonable suspicion based on \nappearance of arrestee, type of charge or other criteria. \n103.  Staff at the Booking Center subject virtually no women to strip searches \nbefore presentment. \n104.  The Booking Center does not have a written policy in place that permits \nstrip searches before presentment without individualized reasonable suspicion \nor reasonable suspicion based on type of charge or other criteria. \n105.  The Booking Center does not have a written policy in place that \nauthorizes the current practice of strip searching virtually all men while strip \nsearching virtually no women. \n106.  As a result of these informal practices, virtually every male arrestee \nprocessed at the Booking Center, after being arrested and awaiting \npresentment on charges involving drugs, weapons, or violence, is strip \nsearched without an individual determination of reasonable suspicion to justify \nthe search, and regardless of the crime with which the person is charged. \n107.  As a result of these informal practices, a substantial percentage of male \narrestees male arrestee committed to the Booking Center, after being arrested \nand awaiting presentment on charges not involving drugs, weapons, or \nviolence, are subjected to a strip search conducted without an individual \ndetermination of reasonable suspicion to justify the search, and regardless of \n  16\n\nthe crime with which the person is charged.  \n108.  As a result of these informal practices, a majority of persons strip \nsearched at the Booking Center after being arrested and awaiting presentment \nare strip searched in the presence of other persons.  \n109.  The Booking Center does not keep any logs or other records of any \nindividual strip searches performed during the booking process. \n110.  Each Warden had actual or constructive knowledge of the \naforementioned practices during his or her tenure, if not before. \n111.  The Warden failed to take appropriate action(s) to ensure that arrestees \nare strip-searched upon individualized suspicion rather than based upon \ngender or due to blanket searches; or to ensure that arrestees are strip-\nsearched in a private setting. \n112.  The City of Baltimore, and the Baltimore City Police Department, through \ntheir agents, have had actual or constructive knowledge of the aforementioned \npractices since at least 2001.  Nonetheless, the City of Baltimore and the \nBaltimore City Police Department knowingly and as part of its policy, practice, \nand custom places its arrestees into the custody of the Booking Center. \nThe Booking Center Practice Of Detaining Arrestees Booked Into The \nBooking Center \n113.  The Booking Center, despite having presentments conducted on-site, has \nan informal practice of not timely presenting arrested persons and detaining \narrestees during this delay. \n  17\n\n114.  As a result of these informal practices, a substantial percentage of \npersons arrested and processed at the Booking Center are detained for more \nthan 48 hours after their arrests without a presentment.  The Booking Center \nhas even detained a substantial number of persons more than 3 days, and \nmany persons more than 4 days, despite the State of Maryland’s procedural \nand arguably state constitutional requirement that presentment occur without \nunreasonable delay, and in no event later than 24 hours after arrest..  \n115.  The Booking Center keeps computerized logs showing the times of arrest, \narrival at the Booking Center, presentment, and release, among other events. \n116.   Each Warden had actual or constructive knowledge of the \naforementioned practices during his or her tenure, if not before. \n117.  The Warden failed to take appropriate action(s) to reduce the demands \non the Booking Center or increase the capacity of the Booking Center to \nprocess more arrestees, such that arrested persons brought to the Booking \nCenter could be processed in a timely manner. \n118.  The City of Baltimore, and the Baltimore City Police Department, through \ntheir agents, have had actual or constructive knowledge of the aforementioned \npractices since at least 2001.  Nonetheless, the City of Baltimore and the \nBaltimore City Police Department knowingly and as part of their policy, \npractice, and custom places its arrestees into the custody of the Booking \nCenter. \n  18\n\nStrip Search Class Action Allegations \n119.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this \naction under Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years \npreceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, was \nor will be, (a) while being held in the Booking Center; (b) for presentment on \neither (c)(i)  a misdemeanor not involving a weapon or drugs, or (ii) a non-\nviolent, non-drug related felony; and (d) strip searched without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. \n120.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n121.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches not based on individualized or \nparticularized suspicion or probable cause. \n122.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n  19\n\n123.  Regarding the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and \nmembers of the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, \nbecause every member of the Class is subjected to the strip search practice, \nand none of the defendants has kept or keeps records of the searches and \ntherefore none of the defendants can show that any of the searches were \nconducted based on an individual determination of reasonable suspicion.  \nShould records exist demonstrating that such an individualized suspicion was \nused in the strip search determination, such people would, by definition, not be \nmembers of the class. \n124.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Booking Center have \nand have had custom and practice of subjecting arrestees being held in the \nBooking Center pending presentment to strip searches without an \nindividualized determination that the person was in possession of drugs, \nweapons, or other contraband; \n    b.  whether such custom and practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n  20\n\n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n125.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n126.  The Booking Center has within its records the names and addresses of \nall the current and past class members in its computerized booking system.  \n127.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are \ntypical of the claims of the other members of the class, because they and all \nother members of the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by \nthe unlawful strip searches. \n128.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and have retained \ncounsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights \nclass action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n129.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n  21\n\n130.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no \ndifficulty that will be encountered in the management of this litigation that \nwould preclude its maintenance as a class action, and the class action is \nsuperior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of \nthe Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Class.  The class action will be \nmanageable, in part, because such an advanced computerized system exists \nfrom which to ascertain the members of the putative class.  For example, the \nBooking Center had stated that it has “the most advanced technological system \nin the world for processing arrestees.” Class treatment will be superior because \nliability can be determined on a class wide basis, and damages can also be \ndetermined on a class wide basis through use of statistical sampling. \nNon-Private Strip Search Class Action Allegations \n131.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years preceding \nthe filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, was or will be, \n(a) while being held in the Booking Center; (b) for presentment; and (d) strip \nsearched in the presence of other arrestees. \n132.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \n  22\n\nmember. \n133.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches not in private. \n134.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n135.  Regarding the Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and members \nof the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because \nevery member of the Class is subjected to the non-private strip search.  \n136.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Booking Center have \nand have had custom and practice of subjecting arrestees being held in the \nBooking Center pending presentment to strip searches in the presence of other \narrested persons; \n    b.  whether such custom and practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \n  23\n\nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n137.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n138.  The Booking Center has within its records the names and addresses of \nall the current and past class members in its computerized booking system.  \n139.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, because they and all other members \nof the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the unlawful \nstrip searches. \n140.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class and have retained counsel \nwho are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action \nlitigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n141.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are \n  24\n\ncontrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n142.  The Non-Private Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that \nwill be encountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to any other \navailable means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Non-Private Strip \nSearch  Class.  The class action will be in part manageable because such an \nadvanced computerized system exists from which to ascertain the members of \nthe putative class.  For example, the Booking Center had stated that it has “the \nmost advanced technological system in the world for processing arrestees.” \nClass treatment will be superior because liability can be determined on a class \nwide basis, and damages can also be determined on a class wide basis through \nuse of statistical sampling. \nEqual Protection Strip Search Class Action Allegations \n143.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action \nunder Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years \npreceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, is \n(a) a male; (b) who was or will be held in the Booking Center; (b) for \npresentment; and (d) was strip searched. \n144.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \n  25\n\nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n145.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of searches of males where similarly-situated \nfemales are not strip searched. \n146.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n147.  Regarding the Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and \nmembers of the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, \nbecause every member of the Class is subjected to the discriminatory strip \nsearch.  \n148.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Booking Center have \nand have had custom and practice of subjecting male arrestees being held in \nthe Booking Center pending presentment to strip searches under \ncircumstances where similarly-situated female arrestees are not strip searched; \n    b.  whether such custom and practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourteenth Amendment; \n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \n  26\n\nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n149.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many thousands of people. \n150.  The Booking Center has within its records the names and addresses of \nall the current and past class members in its computerized booking system.  \n151.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of \nthe claims of the other members of the class, because they and all other \nmembers of the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the \nunlawful strip searches. \n152.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and has retained \ncounsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights \n  27\n\nclass action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n153.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no interests \nthat are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n154.  The Equal Protection Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty \nthat will be encountered in the management of this litigation that would \npreclude its maintenance as a class action, and the class action is superior to \nany other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Equal \nProtection Strip Search Class.  The class action will be in part manageable \nbecause such an advanced computerized system exists from which to ascertain \nthe members of the putative class.  For example, the Booking Center had \nstated that it has “the most advanced technological system in the world for \nprocessing arrestees.” Class treatment will be superior because liability can be \ndetermined on a class wide basis, and damages can also be determined on a \nclass wide basis through use of statistical sampling. \nUntimely Presentment Detention Class Action Allegations \n155.  The Untimely Presentment Detention Named Plaintiff brings this action \nunder Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the three years \npreceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is terminated, (a) \nwas or will be arrested in the City of Baltimore; and (b) was or is detained \nwithout presentment before a commissioner or other judicial officer for more \nthan 48 hours after arrest. \n  28\n\n156.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class, and injunctive \nrelief against Defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class \nmember. \n157.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed custom and practice of not timely presenting arrestees before a \ncommissioner or other judicial officer. \n158.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n159.  Regarding the Untimely Presentment Detention Named Plaintiff, and \nmembers of the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, \nbecause every member of the Class is denied a timely presentment.  \n160.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \n    a.  whether the Defendant Wardens and Booking Center have \nand have had custom and practice of detaining arrestees without a \npresentment for more than 48 hours after their arrest; \n    b.  whether such custom and practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourth Amendment; \n  29\n\n    c.  whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees;  \n    d.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class have \nsustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such damages;  \n    e.  whether plaintiffs and the members of the class and future \nmembers are entitled to equitable relief, and, if so, what is the nature of that \nrelief; and \n    f.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all \nclass members’ damages except those who opt out. \n161.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is \nlikely to consist of at least many hundreds of people. \n162.  The Booking Center has within its records the names and addresses of \nall the current and past class members in its computerized booking system.  \n163.  The Untimely Presentment Detention Named Plaintiff’s claims are typical \nof the claims of the other members of the class, because he and all other \nmembers of the class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by their \npost-arrest detention exceeding 48 hours prior to presentment. \n164.  The Untimely Presentment Detention Named Plaintiff will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the class and has retained \n  30\n\ncounsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights \nclass action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n165.  The Untimely Presentment Detention Named Plaintiff has no interests \nthat are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class. \n166.  The Untimely Presentment Detention Named Plaintiff knows of no \ndifficulty that will be encountered in the management of this litigation that \nwould preclude its maintenance as a class action, and the class action is \nsuperior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of \nthe Untimely Presentment Detention Class.  The class action will be in part \nmanageable because such an advanced computerized system exists from which \nto ascertain the members of the putative class, and that contains the times of \nall relevant events for determining the length of detention beyond 48 hours.  \nFor example, the Booking Center had stated that it has “the most advanced \ntechnological system in the world for processing arrestees.” Class treatment \nwill be superior because liability can be determined on a class wide basis, and \ndamages can also be determined on a class wide basis through use of \nstatistical sampling. \nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nCOUNT 1 \n167.  The Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs re-allege and \nincorporate by reference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n  31\n\n168.  This Count is filed against Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski in \ntheir individual capacities for all purposes, and their official capacities for \npurposes of prospective injunctive relief. \n169.  While being held for presentment in the Booking Center on (a) \nmisdemeanors not involving a weapon or drugs, or (b) non-violent, non-drug \nrelated felony charge(s), each of the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and every other class member were subjected to a strip search \nwithout an individual determination that the search would reveal weapons, \ndrugs or other contraband. \n170.  Subjecting an arrestee arrested on a non-drug, non-weapon \nmisdemeanor, or a non-drug, non-violent felony to a strip search without an \nindividual determination that the search would reveal weapons, drugs or other \ncontraband violates his or her Fourth Amendment Rights. \n171.  The Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that the \nSuspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and other class members \nwere being or would be subject to the strip searches and acquiesced in the \nsearches. \n172.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski failed to supervise and train \ntheir staff in strip searches when the need for supervision and training was \nobvious, and remained inactive in the face of actual or constructive notice of \nthe illegal searches. \n  32\n\n173.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nSuspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ \nFourth Amendment Rights. \n174.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski engaged in and oversaw the \ncustoms and practices described above, which were the moving force behind \nthe deprivations to the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ \nand other class members’ Fourth Amendment Rights, and the Suspicionless \nArrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and the other class members’ injuries \nresulting from the strip searches. \n175.  Defendants Franks, Murphy, and Jednorski caused the unreasonable \nstrip search of the Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all \nother class members by deliberate indifference to the risk of constitutional \ninjury by maintaining and/or acquiescing in a practice and custom of strip \nsearching arrestees as described above. \n176.

While being held for presentment in the Booking Center, each of the \nEqual Protection Named Plaintiffs and every other class member were male, \nand were subjected to a strip search under a custom and policy that caused \nthem to be strip searched but not similarly-situated women. \n194.  There is no legitimate governmental interest justifying the different \ntreatment between men and women. \n  36\n\n195.  Subjecting an arrestee to a strip search on the basis of gender, \nregardless of the charge or suspicion, violates his or her Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights. \n196.  The Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that the Equal \nProtection Named Plaintiffs and other class members were being or would be \nsubjected to the strip searches and acquiesced in the searches. \n197.

Defendants Murphy and Jednorski failed to supervise and train their \nstaff in the need for prompt presentments when the need for supervision \ntraining was obvious, and remained inactive in the face of actual or \nconstructive notice of the illegal detentions without presentment. \n210.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the \nUntimely Presentment Detention Named Plaintiff’s and the class members’ \nFourth Amendment Rights. \n211.

WEST, et al.1      : \n            : \n            : \n  v.          :     Civil No. CCB-05-1287 \n            : \n            : \nSUSAN MURPHY, et al.      : \n            : \n           \nMEMORANDUM \n  In 2005, the plaintiffs in this case filed suit asserting constitutional challenges to strip-\nsearch policies at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Facility (“Central Booking”), and to \nthe alleged practice there of detaining individuals arrested without a warrant for more than 48 \nhours without presenting them to a judicial officer (a practice they call “overdetention”).  The \ncourt certified a class of overdetained plaintiffs, and the defendants later moved to alter the class \nperiod so it corresponds only to the defendant Susan Murphy’s tenure as Central Booking’s \nwarden from March 9, 2004, through June 22, 2005.  The plaintiffs did not oppose that portion of \nthe defendants’ motion, and that portion of the motion will be granted.   \n  Though several other motions are also before the court, the primary issue presented for \nresolution is Ms. Murphy’s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ overdetention claim.  \nAmong other things, Ms. Murphy argues that a reasonable jury could not find that she was \ndeliberately indifferent to delays in detainees’ presentment or release.  The plaintiffs opposed the \nmotion, and a motions hearing was held on July 27, 2012.  For the reasons that follow, Ms. \nMurphy’s motion for summary judgment will be granted.  The remaining pending motions will \n                                                 \n1 On May 23, 2013, Eric Jones’s claims were dismissed for his failure to participate in discovery or \notherwise pursue those claims. \n1 \n\n \nbe denied as moot.   \nBACKGROUND \n  Maryland’s Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (“DPSCS”), one of \nthe “principal departments of the Executive Branch of the State government,” Md. Code, State \nGov’t § 8-201, “is charged with overseeing the Maryland correctional system,” Glover v. State, \n794 A.2d 735, 740 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2002).  One of the units within DPSCS is the Division of \nPretrial Detention and Services (“DPDS”).  Md. Code, Corr. Servs. § 2-201(3).  The State of \nMaryland created DPDS because, among other things, “[t]here [was] an important public need to \ncentralize and coordinate the provision of services to individuals on a pretrial status in Baltimore \nCity,” and the city “d[id] not have the financial resources to fund a local correctional facility at a \nlevel sufficient to meet the needs of those incarcerated.”  Id. § 5-102(c)-(d).  Consistent with the \nreasons for its founding, DPDS is required by statute to operate a “centralized booking facility” \ncontaining “pretrial release services,” “District Court Commissioners,” an “Office of the State’s \nAttorney for Baltimore City,” and “Baltimore City Police Services.”  Id. § 5-404(b)(1)-(4).  That \nfacility is Central Booking.2   \n  Before Central Booking opened in 1995, Baltimore Police Department (“BPD”) “officers \ntook arrestees directly to their districts for booking and processing.”  (DPDS Plan for Efficient \nand Timely Processing on the Booking Floor (“2005 DPDS Plan”), August 2005, Mot. Partial \nSumm. J. by William Jednorski Ex. 9, ECF No. 378-9, at 1.)  Presentment of arrestees to court \ncommissioners who “reviewed charges and determined bail or released the arrestee on personal \n                                                 \n2 To clarify, Central Booking “is run by the State, while the City controls the day-to-day management of \nthe police. . . .  Thus, the City Police deliver the accused to a state run facility.”  (Baltimore City Circuit Court Op. \non Mot. Intervene, Rodney v. Murphy, Case No. 24-C-05-004405, Sept. 29, 2005, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 87, ECF No. \n392-19, at 4.)   \n \n2 \n\n \nrecognizance” also occurred in the BPD’s district offices.  (Id.)  Once Central Booking opened, \nhowever, it provided the location for “booking and processing all arrestees in Baltimore City.”  \n(Baltimore City Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, Booking Process Presentation (“Booking \nProcess Presentation”),3 Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 71, ECF No. 392-3, at 2.)  One reason for locating \nCentral Booking’s various services in one place was to help ensure that, in accordance with state \nlaw, individuals arrested in Baltimore without a warrant “be taken before a judicial officer . . . \nwithout unnecessary delay and in no event later than 24 hours after arrest.”  Md. Rule 4-\n212(f)(1).  (See also Dep. of Lamont Flanagan, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 70, ECF No. 392-2, at 46 \n(describing the reasons for Central Booking’s establishment); Dep. of Susan Murphy, Mot. \nPartial Summ. J. by William Jednorski Ex. 12, ECF No. 378-12, at 47 (stating that court \ncommissioners were placed at Central Booking “to expedite the already-overwrought criminal \njustice system in Baltimore City”).) \n  Central Booking is comprised of six floors, (Dep. of Mitchell Franks, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. \n72, ECF No. 392-4, at 85), extends for two city blocks, (Murphy Dep. at 36), and was designed \nto house between 800 and 900 detainees, (David M. Parrish, Analysis of Baltimore Central \nBooking and Intake Center (“Parrish Analysis”), October 21, 2005, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 73, ECF \nNo. 392-5, at 3; Booking Process Presentation at 3).4  It is divided into two sections: the booking \narea and the housing area.  (Franks Dep. at 85.)  The booking area is located on the second floor.  \n(Murphy Dep. at 29.)  It consists of a booking unit, a medical unit, a classification unit, a records \nunit, court commissioners’ offices, and video bail facilities.  (Booking Process Presentation at 3, \n                                                 \n3 Ms. Murphy represents, and the plaintiffs do not dispute, that the Booking Process Presentation was \nprepared in June 2005.  (Mot. Summ. J. at 7.)   \n4 The number of detainees at Central Booking regularly exceeded its capacity during Ms. Murphy’s tenure \nas warden.  (See Booking Process Presentation at 3 (“From June 2004 – May 2005 the average end of the month \npopulation was 1,183 (32% over capacity)”).)   \n3 \n\n \n9; Franks Dep. at 99-102; Murphy Dep. at 48-50.)  Booking processes are linked through the \ncomputerized Arrest Booking System (“ABS”).  (See, e.g., Franks Dep. at 101-02.)  The housing \narea makes up the third, fourth, and fifth floors and houses male pretrial detainees who have been \ncommitted by a court commissioner.  (Murphy Dep. at 29.)  Only the booking area is at issue \nhere.   \n  During the relevant time period,5 processing of each warrantless arrestee6 at Central \nBooking involved both (1) processing of paperwork concerning the arrestee, and (2) the physical \nmovement of the arrestee through different locations within Central Booking.  (Franks Dep. at \n103.)  Processing of paperwork proceeded as follows.  Following a warrantless arrest, the \narresting officer drafted a statement of probable cause.  (Booking Process Presentation at 7.)  \nThis could be done either remotely (through computers in the officer’s district office) or at \nCentral Booking.  (Id.)  If done remotely, the officer would complete the statement, sign a \n“signature pad,” “lock[ ] the statement,” and “hit[ ] the send button.”  (Id.)  This made the \nstatement available to a police liaison at Central Booking.  (Id.)  The police liaisons, themselves \nBPD officers, then printed the statement and gave it to a state’s attorney.  (Murphy Dep. at 288.)  \nPolice liaisons were also responsible for “contacting the arresting officers if . . . any required \ndocuments [were] missing . . . .”  (2005 DPDS Plan at 3-4.)  If the arresting officer drafted the \nprobable cause statement at Central Booking, the officer printed and handed it to a state’s \nattorney, who reviewed it while the officer was present.  (Booking Process Presentation at 7.)   \n  If the state’s attorney decided not to charge the arrestee, that arrestee would be released \n                                                 \n5 Ms. Murphy was Central Booking’s warden from March 9, 2004, until June 22, 2005.  Because practices \nthere may have changed over the last ten years, the court will use the past tense when referring to them. \n6 Warrantless arrests are also referred to as “on-view arrests” at various places throughout the record.  (See, \ne.g., Murphy Dep. at 53.)   \n \n4 \n\n \nwithout charge, a result referred to throughout the record by its acronym, “RWOC.”  (See, e.g., \nBooking Process Presentation at 6.)  If the state’s attorney did decide to charge the arrestee, the \ncharges were entered into the ABS.  (Id.)  The paperwork indicating the charge then made its \nway to a police liaison, who acknowledged receipt of the paperwork through the ABS.  (Id. at \n12.)  A police liaison then delivered that paperwork to a “public safety officer,” who entered into \nthe ABS that the paperwork was received and delivered it to Pretrial Services. (Id.)  Pretrial \nServices conducted a check of the arrestee’s criminal record, and entered into the ABS that the \ncheck was completed.  (Id.)   \n  If Pretrial Services identified the arrestee as a “war room offender,” i.e., a violent, repeat \noffender, the paperwork was sent to the “war room.”  (Id.; 2005 DPDS Plan at ii.)  The war \nroom, created in 2003, was a location at Central Booking staffed by the State’s Attorney’s office, \nthe State Division of Parole and Probation, DPDS, and the BPD.  (2005 DPDS Plan at ii.)  \nRepresentatives of these agencies collaborated to identify individuals they deemed particularly \ndangerous, and subject them to “a more rigorous evaluation of court and supervision records” \nbefore clearing the arrestee to see a court commissioner.  (Id.)  If the arrestee was not identified \nas a war room offender, the paperwork returned to a public safety officer and then went to a \ncourt commissioner.  (Booking Process Presentation at 12.)   \n  The physical processing of warrantless arrestees at Central Booking proceeded as \nfollows.  The arresting officer affixed an identification wristband, which contained a barcode, \nonto the arrestee.  (Dep. of William Smith, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 76, ECF No. 392-8, at 145; \nMurphy Dep. at 269.)  The officer put certain information into the barcode, including the time of \narrest.  (Smith Dep. at 145-47; Murphy Dep. at 269-272.)  Officers then took the arrestee to \n5 \n\n \nCentral Booking.  Booking officers took the arrestee into the facility through its sally port.7  \n(Franks Dep. at 97).  Public safety officers took the arrestee to a search room where they \nsearched the arrestee.  (Booking Process Presentation at 9.)  After the search, public safety \nofficers took the arrestee to the booking window, (id.), where the arrestee provided identifying \npersonal information (name, address, etc.), and the wristband was scanned for information \nconcerning the arrest, including the time it occurred, (Franks Dep. at 105-07).8  The arrestee was \nassigned “a unique identifying number” that was logged into the ABS to track the arrestee within \nCentral Booking.  (Murphy Dep. at 269.)  The arrestee was then taken to the “identification \nroom,” where the arrestee’s photographs and fingerprints were taken.  (Franks Dep. at 105.)  The \narrestee was then given an opportunity for one free phone call.  (Id.)  After a medical screening, \nthe arrestee was placed in a cell to await presentment before a court commissioner.  (Id.)  To \nfacilitate the tracking of arrestees, the arrestee’s wristband was scanned at each location \nthroughout the process, and the location information was entered into the ABS.  (Smith Dep. at \n145-47; Murphy Dep. at 276.)   \n  Ms. Murphy began working at Central Booking as an assistant warden for security in \n2001.  (Murphy Dep. at 28.)  At some point she transitioned into an assistant warden for \nbooking, a position in which she served until she became acting warden on March 9, 2004.  (Id. \nat 64; Decl. of Susan Murphy ¶ 1, Mot. Partial Summ. J. by William Jednorski Ex. 3, ECF No. \n378-3.)  She transitioned from acting warden to warden on June 23, 2004, and served in that \n                                                 \n7 In this context, a sally port is “a secure entryway (as at a prison) that consists of a series of doors or \ngates.”  Sally port Definition, Merriam-Webster.com, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sally%20port \n(last visited Feb. 23, 2015).  \n8 There is also evidence in the record concerning “toe tags.”  (See, e.g., Booking Process Presentation at 5.)  \n“A toe tag is a piece of paper that the arrestees would bring with them to Central Booking that had been filled out by \nthe arresting police officer.”  (Murphy Dep. at 220.)  It is unclear if toe tags and identification wristbands were both \nused, toe tags were used when wristbands were unavailable, or both performed the same function.   \n \n6 \n\n \ncapacity until June 22, 2005.  (Id.; Mot. Summ. J. at 1.)  From March 9, 2004, to June 22, 2005, \n111,749 individuals were booked at Central Booking, an average of 238 per day.  (Decl. of \nKevin Nichols, Pls.’ Resp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 252, at 2.) \n  Timely presentment of warrantless arrestees became an issue during Ms. Murphy’s tenure \nas warden.  Though officials were primarily concerned with Maryland’s 24-hour limit, between \none and two percent of individuals booked at Central Booking during that time were warrantless \narrestees detained beyond the constitutional limit of 48 hours without presentment.9  The sources \nof delays included: (1) the time it took for BDP officers to bring arrestees to Central Booking \nfollowing their arrest, (Murphy Dep. at 273; Franks Dep. at 238; Smith Dep. at 150-51); (2) the \nfailure of BPD officers to timely and properly complete the statements of probable cause to make \nthem accessible at Central Booking, (Murphy Dep. at 286-87; Dep. of Corey Moss, Mot. Summ. \nJ. Ex. 77, ECF No. 392-9, at 29; Smith Dep. at 150-51; Booking Process Presentation at 15); (3) \nthe failure of police liaisons to print the statements and/or give them to state’s attorneys, (Franks \nDep. at 239; Murphy Dep. at 290, 305; Moss Dep. at 30-31); (4) delayed action by state’s \nattorneys once they received the statements, (Franks Dep. at 238-39; Flanagan Dep. at 52; Dep. \nof David Becketts, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 75, ECF No. 392-8, at 96-97); (5) war room delays, \n(Becketts Dep. at 85; Murphy Dep. at 308-09); and (6) understaffing of court commissioners, \n(Franks Dep. at 88-89, 238; Smith Dep. at 153; Booking Process Presentation at 19). \n  In light of these delays, Maryland’s Office of the Public Defender (“OPD”) began filing \npetitions for habeas corpus on behalf of individuals detained at Central Booking who were not \npresented to a court commissioner within 24 hours of their warrantless arrest, as required by \nMaryland law.  (See Baltimore City Circuit Court Op. on Mot. Intervene, Rodney v. Murphy, \n                                                 \n9 The plaintiffs say 2,212 such overdetentions occurred, while Ms. Murphy says 1,014 (and perhaps fewer) \noccurred.  The court need not, and does not, resolve that dispute here.   \n7 \n\n \nCase No. 24-C-05-004405, Sept. 29, 2005, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 87, ECF No. 392-19, at 1 \n(recounting case history).)  That led to the filing of a class action suit against Ms. Murphy in the \nCircuit Court for Baltimore City.10  (Id.)  On April 25, 2005, that court issued a temporary \nrestraining order (“TRO”) ordering that “any individual held longer than 24 hours without being \ntaken before a judicial officer of the District Court as required by Rule 4-212 shall be \nimmediately released from [Central Booking] on any charges for which the individual was \ndenied prompt presentment, unless [Ms. Murphy] files a motion demonstrating good cause for \nnoncompliance . . . .”  (TRO, Rodney v. Murphy, April. 25, 2005, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 86, ECF \nNo. 392-18.)  On May 9, 2005, the court extended the TRO until November 9, 2005.  (See \nSecond Am. Compl. ¶ 4, Rodney v. Murphy, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 93, ECF No. 392-25.)  \nAccording to a news report, by May 10, 2005, the TRO had led to the release of 27 arrestees.  \n(Ryan Davis, “Deal extends city jail order,” Baltimore Sun, May 10, 2005, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. \n88, ECF No. 392-20.)  The City of Baltimore then moved to intervene, citing “the urgent health \nand safety risks posed by the release of dangerous individuals into the community . . . .”  (See \nMot. Shorten Time for Response in Mot. Intervene, Rodney v. Murphy, June 29, 2005, Mot. \nSumm. J. Ex. 89, ECF No. 392-21.)  The court denied the City’s motion on September 29, 2005, \nbut allowed the City to participate as an amicus.  (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 87.)  At the court’s \ndirection, DPDS produced and submitted the 2005 DPDS Plan, which called for a number of \nsystemic changes.  (Id. at 4; 2005 DPDS Plan.)  The court dissolved the injunction and dismissed \nthe case on September 15, 2006.  (Mot. Summ. J. at 23; Pls.’ Proposed Class Definitions, ECF \nNo. 268, at 1 n.1).  The Rodney court’s involvement spurred the affected agencies to display an \n“unprecedented” level of cooperation and work together to solve the problems delaying \n                                                 \n10 The exact date the suit was filed is unclear from the record.  \n \n8 \n\n \npresentment.  (Parrish Analysis at 4.)   \n  Meanwhile, on May 12, 2005, former detainees at Central Booking filed a complaint in \nthis court asserting claims of overdetention and unconstitutional strip searches.  Count Four of \nthe Fourth Amended Complaint asserts a claim of supervisory liability against Ms. Murphy in \nher individual capacity for overdetentions at Central Booking during her time as warden.11  \n(Fourth Am. Compl. ¶ 294, ECF No. 146.)  Years of litigation followed.  On March 19, 2009, the \ncourt certified a class of overdetained individuals.  On January 31, 2011, Ms. Murphy moved for \nsummary judgment as to the overdetention claim against her.  The plaintiffs responded.  A \nmotions hearing was held on July 27, 2012.12     \nANALYSIS \nSummary Judgment Standard \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) provides that summary judgment should be granted \n“if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (emphasis added).  Whether a fact \nis material depends upon the substantive law.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, \n248 (1986).  Accordingly, “the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the \nparties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment.”  Id. at \n247-48.  “A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment ‘may not rest \n                                                 \n11 The count also asserts a claim against William Jednorski in his individual capacity, and Mitchell Franks \nin his official capacity.  Mr. Jednorski preceded Ms. Murphy as warden at Central Booking, and Mr. Franks \nsucceeded her.  On December 6, 2010, the three defendant wardens moved to alter the class periods, including by \nlimiting the overdetention class period to Ms. Murphy’s tenure as warden.  The plaintiffs did not oppose the motion \nto the extent it sought to limit the overdetention class period.  Accordingly, the court will grant that motion to the \nextent it seeks to limit the overdetention class period, and will deny it as moot to the extent it seeks to limit the strip \nsearch class period.   \n12 On March 5, 2013, the court granted summary judgment to Ms. Murphy and Mr. Jednorski on the \nplaintiffs’ strip search claims, on the grounds of qualified immunity.  The remainder of the case was stayed pending \nthe Fourth Circuit’s review of that decision.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed on November 14, 2014.  West v. Murphy, \n771 F.3d 209 (4th Cir. 2014). \n9 \n\n \nupon the mere allegations or denials of [his] pleadings,’ but rather must ‘set forth specific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.’”  Bouchat v. Baltimore Ravens Football Club, \nInc., 346 F.3d 514, 522 (4th Cir. 2003) (alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  \nThe court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all \njustifiable inferences in his favor.  Greater Baltimore Ctr. for Pregnancy Concerns, Inc. v. \nMayor and City Council of Baltimore, 721 F.3d 264, 283 (4th Cir. 2013) (en banc).  At the same \ntime, the court must not yield its obligation “to prevent factually unsupported claims and \ndefenses from proceeding to trial.”  Bouchat, 346 F.3d at 526 (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nSupervisory Liability \n  The plaintiffs raise a constitutional claim against Ms. Murphy, and seek to hold her liable \nfor their overdetentions under a theory of supervisory liability.  Supervisory liability under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 “is not premised upon respondeat superior . . . .”  Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, \n798 (4th Cir. 1994).  Rather, to succeed on a § 1983 claim based on supervisory liability, a \nplaintiff must show: \n (1) that the supervisor had actual or constructive knowledge that h[er] \nsubordinate was engaged in conduct that posed “a pervasive and unreasonable \nrisk” of constitutional injury to citizens like the plaintiff; (2) that the \nsupervisor’s response to that knowledge was so inadequate as to show \n“deliberate indifference to or tacit authorization of the alleged offensive \npractices,”; and (3) that there was an “affirmative causal link” between the \nsupervisor’s inaction and the particular constitutional injury suffered by the \nplaintiff. \n \nId. at 799 (citations omitted).  “As to the second element, a plaintiff ‘may establish deliberate \nindifference by demonstrating a supervisor’s continued inaction in the face of documented \nwidespread abuses.’”  Wilkins v. Montgomery, 751 F.3d 214, 226-27 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting \n \n10 \n\n \nShaw, 13 F.3d at 799).   \n  Arrests must be supported by probable cause to believe that the arrestee committed (or \nwas committing) an offense.  See, e.g., Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 111 (1975).  “To \nimplement the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unfounded invasions of liberty and \nprivacy, the [Supreme] Court has required that the existence of probable cause be decided by a \nneutral and detached magistrate whenever possible.”  Id. at 112.  When a police officer arrests \nsomeone without a warrant, however, only the officer has determined that probable cause exists.  \nTherefore, the government must “promptly” arrange for the arrestee’s presentment before a \njudicial officer for a probable cause assessment.  Id. at 125.  Presentment within 48 hours is \npresumptively constitutional, and an arrested individual presented to a judicial officer within that \ntime bears the burden of showing “that his or her probable cause determination was delayed \nunreasonably.”  Cnty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991).  “Where an arrested \nindividual does not receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours, . . . the burden shifts \nto the government to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary \ncircumstance.”  Id. at 57.   \n  Ms. Murphy concedes that the plaintiffs have put forth evidence sufficient to establish the \nfirst element of pervasive and unreasonable risk of constitutional injury.  She argues, however, \nthat a reasonable jury could not find that she was deliberately indifferent to delays in \npresentment, or that there was an affirmative causal link between her alleged inaction and the \ndelays.  The court agrees that no genuine dispute of material fact exists to support the element of \ndeliberate indifference, and therefore will not reach the question of causation.   \n  The foundation of Ms. Murphy’s argument is that the undisputed evidence demonstrates \n11 \n\n \nthat delays in presentment of warrantless arrestees were due to problems largely out of her \ncontrol, and that is why overdetentions persisted despite her efforts to prevent them.  As Central \nBooking’s warden, Ms. Murphy was an employee of DPDS, a state agency, see Md. Code, Corr. \nServs. § 5-404, and her immediate supervisor was DPDS’s Deputy Commissioner (though \nDPSCS’s Commissioner “signed off” on Central Booking’s policies).  (Murphy Dep. at 256; \nFlanagan Dep. at 34).  Within Central Booking, she supervised other DPDS employees, \nincluding a chief of security, assistant wardens, majors, captains, sergeants, and correctional \nofficers.  (Flanagan Dep. at 40-41.)  But Ms. Murphy is correct that the timely presentment of \nwarrantless arrestees also involved many outside her supervision, including BPD officers, state’s \nattorneys, and court commissioners, each of whom could be (and were) responsible for delays. \n  BPD officers caused delays in several ways.  Hours often passed between when a BPD \nofficer arrested someone and when the arrestee was brought to Central Booking.  (Murphy Dep. \nat 273; Franks Dep. at 238; Smith Dep. at 150-51.)  BPD officers often were slow to complete a \nstatement of probable cause, (Murphy Dep. at 286-87; Moss Dep. at 29; Booking Process \nPresentation at 15), failed to “lock” the statement or hit “send” so it could enter the computer \nsystem, (Smith Dep. at 150-51; Booking Process Presentation at 15), or were unable to complete \nthe statement process because of broken “signature pads,” (Booking Process Presentation at 15).  \nThough it was the responsibility of the police liaisons to contact the arresting officers for missing \ndocuments, (2005 DPDS Plan at 3-4), “the police liaisons initially did not feel that it was their \nresponsibility to move quickly,” (Franks Dep. at 239).  When statements of probable cause \narrived at Central Booking, the police liaisons, whose responsibilities also included printing the \nstatements and giving them to a state’s attorney, sometimes refused to do so.  (Murphy Dep. at \n \n12 \n\n \n290, 305.)13   \n  State’s attorneys were also frequently responsible for delays once they received the \narresting officer’s statement.  (Franks Dep. at 238-39; Flanagan Dep. at 52; Becketts Dep. at 96-\n97; see also OPD letter to Judge Glynn dated Oct. 31, 2005, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 78, ECF No. \n392-10, at 1 (“Our office, in reviewing those circumstances where an individual is close to or \npast the 24th hour mark, has observed that the majority of these cases involve a delay in the \ncompletion of the paperwork by either the Police Department and/or the State’s Attorney’s \nOffice.”).)  These delays were sometimes linked to the state’s attorneys’ activities in the war \nroom.  (Becketts Dep. at 85; Murphy Dep. at 308-09.) \n  Even when an arrestee (and his paperwork) had been fully and timely processed, \npresentment was further delayed when the number of available court commissioners was \ninsufficient, (Franks Dep. at 238; Smith Dep. at 153; Booking Process Presentation at 19), \ncausing the available commissioners to be overwhelmed by the volume of arrestees, (Flanagan \nDep. at 48; Smith Dep. at 153).   \n  The undisputed evidence also makes clear that Ms. Murphy took various actions to \nprevent and reduce overdetentions.  First, she personally monitored the issue and sought to \nremedy potential delays as they arose: she used the ABS to monitor the lengths of arrestees’ \ndetentions in real time, (Murphy Dep. at 84), printed reports highlighting warrantless arrestees \nwho had been detained for the longest periods of time to prioritize those individuals, (id. at 229), \nand when arrestees had been detained without presentment for more than 24 hours she went to \n                                                 \n13 Ms. Murphy’s uncontradicted testimony indicated that police liaisons sometimes refused to refill the \npaper in their own printers, preventing the statements of probable cause from printing.  (Murphy Dep. at 290, 305.)  \nIf a member of Central Booking’s staff “print[ed] it out for the police liaisons and t[ook] it to them so that they \ncould give it to the State’s attorney,” some police liaisons “would just take what [the] lieutenants would bring to \nthem and throw [it] in the trash.”  (Id. at 305.)   \n13 \n\n \nthe booking floor to “look[ ] for answers,” (id. at 229-30; Dep. of James Shields, Mot. Summ. J. \nEx. 85, ECF No. 392-17, at 66).  Second, she focused her staff on the problem by issuing “post \norders” – documents describing the duties of a particular position, (Murphy Dep. at 125-26), – \nfor the booking lieutenant, (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 82, ECF No. 392-14), the booking shift \ncommander, (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 83, ECF No. 392-15), and the sergeant assigned to the position \nof “arrest booking lead,” (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 84, ECF No. 392-16), that required these \nindividuals to monitor the booking queue and potential delays.  Third, she alerted her superiors \nto the issue of delays in presentment.  She did this by writing a thorough memorandum to Deputy \nCommissioner Howard Ray, her immediate supervisor, (Murphy Dep. at 255), addressing the \nproblem and its varied causes (Memo, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 79, ECF No. 392-11), and by raising \nthe issue in Monday morning meetings with DPDS Commissioner William Smith, (Murphy Dep. \nat 265-66).  Fourth, she worked with representatives of other agencies in Central Booking whose \nactivities were linked to delays: she had meetings with representatives of all the agencies with \noperations in Central Booking to discuss the problem and work to resolve it, (Shields Dep. at 64-\n66), met and spoke regularly with BPD officers about the issue, (Murphy Dep. at 309-12), and \nhad a long meeting about the issue with the then-commissioner of the BPD, (id. at 314).14   \n  Under these circumstances, where the undisputed evidence establishes both that delays in \npresentment were largely due to factors beyond Ms. Murphy’s control, and Ms. Murphy took \nvarious actions in her attempt to eliminate overdetentions, no reasonable jury could find that she \n                                                 \n14 Ms. Murphy attaches what she describes as a sample of booking records with “delay comments,” and \nargues that it demonstrates both “the systemic problem of delays in the preparation or transmission of charging \ndocuments by allied agencies” and “the persistent efforts made by Central Booking officers to address this \nproblem.”  (Mot. Summ. J. at 16 (citing Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 81, ECF No. 392-13).)  The plaintiffs do not dispute that \nthese booking records show that a high percentage of the delays arose from the unavailability of charging documents \n(for which BPD officers were responsible), or that Central Booking officers made repeated requests to the police \nliaisons for these documents.   \n \n \n14 \n\n \nwas deliberately indifferent to the problem.  See West v. Tillman, 496 F.3d 1321, 1333 (11th Cir. \n2007) (rejecting claims of deliberate indifference to overdetention where delays were caused by \nissues outside the defendants’ control and the defendants “undertook to address” the issues).  \nThis case is not one where the supervisor’s response to “documented widespread abuses” was \nanything approaching “continued inaction.”  Wilkins, 751 F.3d at 226 (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).   \n  The plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary fall into two main categories, the first of which \nis that Ms. Murphy should have done more to speed the release of warrantless arrestees.  \nSpecifically, they say she failed to take “a more pro-active approach,” (Pls.’ Resp. Mot. Summ. \nJ. at 14), “releas[e] minor offenders,” (id. at 15), or seek “court permission to detain warrantless \narrestees beyond 48 hours without presentment,” (id. at 20).  As to Ms. Murphy’s supposed \nfailure to take a more pro-active approach, “[d]eliberate indifference is a very high standard,” \nGrayson v. Peed, 195 F.3d 692, 695 (4th Cir. 1999), and “[a] ‘showing of mere negligence’ will \nnot suffice,” Danser v. Stansberry, 772 F.3d 340, 347 (4th Cir. 2014) (citing id.).  Even if Ms. \nMurphy’s actions (or failures to act) could be characterized as negligent, they do not approach \ndeliberate indifference.15  As to the plaintiffs’ suggestion that she should have released “minor” \noffenders, the plaintiffs fail to explain how Ms. Murphy should have unilaterally determined \nwhich individuals were arrested for offenses sufficiently “minor” to justify their release.  They \nalso fail to adequately address the fact that DPDS Commissioner William Smith, apparently \nreversing an earlier policy that allowed releases in exceptional circumstances, specifically \n                                                 \n15 The plaintiffs also argue that because Ms. Murphy testified in her deposition that she was unaware of the \nconstitution’s 48-hour limit on detention, (Murphy Dep. at 219), she cannot now argue that she did anything to avoid \ndetentions beyond 48 hours.  Not so.  Ms. Murphy made clear that, in accordance with Maryland law, she focused \non reducing the length of detentions to less than 24 hours.  Her knowledge of the less stringent constitutional limit is \nirrelevant.   \n15 \n\n \ninstructed Ms. Murphy not to release overdetained individuals.  (Smith Dep. at 156, 201-02; \nMurphy Dep. at 58, 216, 233, 256-60.)  And as to Ms. Murphy’s failure to seek court permission, \nthe plaintiffs do not explain how Ms. Murphy could have done so before the court in Rodney v. \nMurphy issued its TRO on April 25, 2005 – just two months before Ms. Murphy’s time as \nCentral Booking’s warden ended.  Nor do they explain how Rodney’s case-by-case remedy could \nhave addressed the systemic, inter-agency problems underlying delays.  In short, Ms. Murphy \ncannot be held deliberately indifferent simply because she did not take the remedial actions of \nthe plaintiffs’ choosing.  \n  The plaintiffs’ second argument is that Ms. Murphy is automatically liable for \noverdetentions that occurred while she was warden, either because she was the arrestees’ \n“custodian,” (Pls.’ Resp. Mot. Summ. J. at 17-20), or because she was Central Booking’s “final \npolicymaker,” (id. at 21).  The “custodian” theory might reasonably be applied where the \nmunicipality itself may be fairly characterized as an arrestee’s custodian.  See Bernard v. City of \nPalo Alto, 699 F.2d 1023, 1027 (9th Cir. 1983) (“The County is responsible for operating the jail \nand has custody over arrestees.”) (emphasis added).  The same may be true for a particular \nagency, such as a police department.  See Wayland v. City of Springdale, 933 F.2d 668, 670 (8th \nCir. 1991) (where officials were sued in both their official and individual capacities, stating that \n“the police were under no obligation to continue to hold” an overdetained arrestee) (emphasis \nadded).  But it does not make sense to apply that theory where, as here, the plaintiffs seek money \ndamages from a state official, sued in her individual capacity, in a context where processing of \nwarrantless arrestees involved a mix of officials both state (e.g., Central Booking officers) and \nlocal (e.g., BPD officers).  The plaintiffs’ characterization of Ms. Murphy as Central Booking’s \n \n16 \n\n \ncustodian would evade the applicable standard of deliberate indifference.  The “final \npolicymaker” theory fails for similar reasons: though it fits within a municipal liability theory, its \napplication here would turn supervisory liability into respondeat superior.  And in any event, \nthere is no evidence that a policy adopted by Ms. Murphy was responsible for Central Booking’s \noverdetention issues.  See Powell v. Sheriff, Fulton Cnty. Ga., 511 F. App’x 957, 962-63 (11th \nCir. 2013) (holding that the plaintiffs failed to show deliberate indifference to their overdetention \nbecause delays arose from “various factors outside [the sheriff’s] control,” not “any custom or \npolicy” the sheriff had adopted),16 cert. denied sub nom. Matkin v. Barett, 134 S. Ct. 513 (2013). \nQualified Immunity \n  In the alternative, Ms. Murphy also argues that she is protected by qualified immunity.  \nAt the summary judgment stage, qualified immunity shields federal and state officials from \nmoney damages unless a plaintiff offers evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude \n“(1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was ‘clearly \nestablished’ at the time of the challenged conduct.”  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2080 \n(2011).  “A Government official’s conduct violates clearly established law when, at the time of \nthe challenged conduct, ‘[t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear’ that every ‘reasonable \nofficial would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.’”  Id. at 2083 (citation \nomitted).  “In the end, the lodestar for whether a right was clearly established is whether the law \n‘gave the officials “fair warning” that their conduct was unconstitutional.’”  Iko v. Shreve, 535 \nF.3d 225, 238 (4th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).   \n  Ms. Murphy argues that she is entitled to qualified immunity because, among other \nreasons, a reasonable official in her position would not have believed she was authorized to act \n                                                 \n16 Unpublished cases are cited not as precedent but for the soundness of their reasoning. \n17 \n\n \nunilaterally to release arrestees who had not been timely presented to a court commissioner.  The \nplaintiffs’ failure to address this argument suggests they have abandoned arguments to the \ncontrary.  See Mentch v. E. Sav. Bank, FSB, 949 F. Supp. 1236, 1247 (D. Md. 1997) (holding \nthat failure to address the defendant’s arguments for summary judgment in an opposition brief \nconstituted abandonment of the claim).  Regardless, however, Ms. Murphy is correct that she is \nentitled to qualified immunity.  Even assuming that Ms. Murphy’s conduct was unconstitutional, \nthe plaintiffs have cited no authority from the Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit, or the Court of \nAppeals of Maryland clearly establishing that a warden in Ms. Murphy’s position would violate \nan arrestee’s constitutional rights by not taking the remedial actions the plaintiffs suggest could \nhave alleviated Central Booking’s overdetention problem.  “Officials are not liable for bad \nguesses in gray areas; they are liable for transgressing bright lines.”  Maciariello v. Sumner, 973 \nF.2d 295, 298 (4th Cir. 1992).  The issues facing Central Booking – with its mix of state and \nlocal agencies, several of which were responsible for delays in presentment of warrantless \narrestees – constituted a gray area, and Ms. Murphy’s failure to unilaterally release overdetained \nindividuals or seek judicial permission to prolong their detention crossed no bright lines.  She \nthus had no “fair warning” that her conduct was unconstitutional, and is entitled to qualified \nimmunity. \n  Accordingly, the court will grant Ms. Murphy’s motion for summary judgment.   \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated above, the defendants’ motion to alter class periods will be granted \nto the extent it seeks to limit the overdetention class to Ms. Murphy’s tenure as warden, and \ndenied as moot in all other respects.  Ms. Murphy’s motion for summary judgment will be \n \n18 \n\n \ngranted.  The following motions will be denied as moot: the plaintiffs’ motion for relief \nconcerning the court’s April 15, 2010 order, the plaintiffs’ motion to strike a late document, the \nplaintiffs’ motion to depose Glenn Marrow, and the plaintiffs’ emergency motion to withdraw \ntheir combined opposition.   \nA separate order follows. \n \nFebruary 24, 2015              /S/         \nDate              Catherine C.

THE LITIGATION \n1.  On July 21, 2006, the NAACP Plaintiffs (with the exception of the Plaintiffs who \njoined the case in February 2008 with the filing of an amended complaint) commenced the \nAction by filing a complaint against the Municipal Defendants and other parties alleging, among \nother things, that the Department engaged in a pattern and practice of arrests without probable \ncause in violation of the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \n2.  The NAACP Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 27, 2008, adding \nadditional Plaintiffs and Defendants. \n3.  In December 2008, the Settling Parties agreed to suspend the prosecution of the \nAction and engaged in settlement negotiations.  The Municipal Defendants, and especially the \nleadership of the Department, have worked closely and cooperatively with the NAACP Plaintiffs \nin fashioning the terms of this Agreement.  These terms are based upon four key principles: 1) \nestablishing policies and providing written guidance regarding the effective policing of Quality \nof Life Offenses; 2) training Department personnel regarding those policies; 3) tracking \ncompliance with the policies; and 4) holding Departmental personnel accountable for conduct \nviolative of the policies. \n3 \n\nCCaassee  11::0066--ccvv--0011886633--CCCCBB      DDooccuummeenntt  229956--21       FFiilleedd  0066//2295//1100      PPaaggee  44  ooff  5577\nII.  CLAIMS OF THE NAACP PLAINTIFFS \nThe NAACP Plaintiffs believe that the claims asserted in the Action have merit and that \ntheir investigation and analysis of the facts and the law in this matter support the claims asserted. \nHowever, the NAACP Plaintiffs and their counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and \nlength of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Action against the Municipal \nDefendants through trial and appeals.  Plaintiffs agree that this Agreement is a fair and \nreasonable settlement with the Municipal Defendants. \nIII.  THE MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS' DENIAL \nOF WRONGDOING AND LIABILITY \nThe Municipal Defendants have denied and continue to deny all allegations of \nwrongdoing or liability asserted against them in the Action.  Nonetheless, the Municipal \nDefendants recognize that continuing the Action through trial and appeals would be protracted \nand expensive, and that it is desirable and in the best interests of the Municipal Defendants and \nthe citizens of Baltimore, that the Action be fully and finally settled in the manner set forth \nherein. \nIV.  TERMS OF STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT OF SETTLEMENT \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED by and among the \nSettling Parties that the Action shall be fully and finally settled on and subject to the terms and \nconditions set forth below. \nA.

S \nConstitution.  The Department shall enforce the directive or directives as set forth \nin sections IV.B.l.c and IV.B.l.e of this Agreement.  [IV.B.l.a.2] \n3.  The written directive or directives concerning Quality of Life Offenses required \nby Section IV .B.l.a.2 shall include a requirement that any time an officer effects a \ncustodial arrest for a Quality of Life Offense, the officer shall record in the \nincident report and the statement of probable cause the factual basis for his or her \ndecision to effect a custodial arrest, rather than providing counseling, a verbal \nwarning or issuing a citation.  [IV.B.l.a.2.a] \na.  The Auditor shall review a statistically meaningful sample of statements \nof probable cause required by section IV .B.l.a.2.a to determine whether the \nfactual narrative of the arrest could on its face support a finding of probable cause \nand that the arrest was in accord with the Policies. \n4.  Within 30 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department shall issue \na written directive requiring officers to provide their names and badge numbers to \nany individual who requests this information.  [IV.B.l.a.3] \n5.  The Zero Tolerance Policing policy required by section IV.B.l.a.l shall not be \nrescinded or diminished by the Department during the term of this Agreement. \n[IV.B.l.a.4] \n6.  The written directive or directives required by section IV.B.l.a.2 shall not be \nrescinded or diminished by the Department during the term of this Agreement \nunless (a) the Department determines, in good faith and upon advice of counsel, \nthat the policies conflict or will conflict with any applicable law, regulation, or \n\nCCaassee  11::0066--ccvv--0011886633--CCCCBB      DDooccuummeenntt  229956--21       FFiilleedd  0066//2295//1100      PPaaggee  5500  ooff  5577\n(\"LEOBR\"), Md.

Within 365 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department shall \ndevelop protocols for use of the database in evaluating compliance with the \nPolicies.  Such protocols shall establish reasonable triggering thresholds for \nreview of officer conduct to monitor effective compliance with the Policies. \n[IV.B.l.c.3 et. seq.] \n•  The protocols referred to here are the \"triggering points\" for the EWS.  The \nAuditor will confirm that each of the protocols required by the Agreement are \ndeveloped and implemented.  The Auditor will also report on the efficacy of \nthe triggering points established by the Department. \n12.

[IV .B.1.d.l] \n13. Complainants shall be allowed to initiate complaints against an officer in person, \nby telephone, by mail, by fax, or via the internet.  A complainant shall not be \nrequired to fill out or sign a form to initiate a complaint.  Municipal Defendants \nmay seek from the complainant sufficient information to enable the identification \nof the involved officers and incident.  [IV.B.l.d.3] \n•  For Tasks 13, 14, 18 -21, the Settling Parties anticipate that the Auditor will \nevaluate the Department's compliance with this task by reviewing a \nstatistically meaningful sample of complaint investigation files and other \ndocumentation, if any, identified by the Auditor.  Such sample shall include a \nmeaningful percentage of investigation files regarding complaints for false \narrest or lack of probable cause for Quality of Life Offenses to satisfy section \nIV .B.l.b.18 of this Agreement. \n14. Complainants shall be permitted to initiate complaints anonymously, in writing or \nverbally.  Third-party complaints shall be allowed.

Within 180 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the telephone number \nshall be advertised with the goal that Baltimore residents and visitors should be \ngenerally aware of how to initiate a complaint.[IV.B.l.d.6] \n17. Within 365 days ofthe Effective Date of this Agreement, the Municipal \nDefendants shall publicize information concerning the purpose and goals of the \ncitizen complaint and resolution process, and the process for initiating a \ncomplaint, including publishing and distributing pamphlets describing the \ncomplaint and resolution process and holding at least one community meeting in \neach police district.  [IV.B.l.d.7] \n18. Investigators shall attempt to interview complainants and witnesses at their own \nconvenience, but, if necessary, shall offer to conduct interviews during non \nbusiness hours or at locations other than Departmental offices.  [IV.B.I.d.8] \n19. If conduct in contravention of Departmental policy other than the conduct alleged \nby the complainant is discovered in the course of an investigation, the Department \nshall investigate such other conduct.  [IV.B.I.d.9] \n20. Upon request, the Department shall provide a complainant reasonable updates on \nthe status of the investigation.  Even absent any such request for information, \ncomplainants shall be apprised of the status of open complaints every 60 days and \npromptly upon resolution of the investigation. [IV.B.l.d.I 0] \n21. All findings shall be based on the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard, and \nall investigators shall be trained on that standard.  Investigators shall be required \nto state the factual basis for each finding in the final report of each investigation. \n[IV.B.I.d.ll] \n22. The Municipal Defendants shall make final determinations of all citizen \ncomplaints, and shall inform each complainant in writing of the final \ndetermination on his or her complaint.  [IV.B.l.d.12] \n23. When a review of an officer's performance is triggered by a data analysis under \nSection IV.B.l.c.3, the Department shall notify the appropriate supervisor of the \nofficer or officers in question.  This notice shall include the information available \nfrom the Section IV.B.l.c.3 database that triggered the review.[IV.B.l.e.l] \n24.

The lawsuit was \nbrought nearly four years ago, on behalf of the NAACP as well as 13 individual plaintiffs who \nalleged that they had been arrested without probable cause for \"quality of life\" offenses such as \nloitering and disorderly conduct. \nUnder the terms of the settlement, the Police Department has agreed to institute policies \nthat reject \"Zero-Tolerance Policing\" and establish a range of appropriate officer responses when \nfaced with minor offenses.  In addition, the Department will issue written directives that spell out \nthe elements of common minor offenses to ensure that officers are aware of the scope of their \nauthority.  Every officer will be trained on the new policies for offenses, and the Department will \nmonitor officer conduct to ensure compliance with the new policies.  The Department's efforts \nand internal monitoring under the settlement will be reviewed by an independent auditor, who \nwill file public reports regarding the Department's compliance. \nThe ACLU, NAACP, and the individual plaintiffs recognize that the Baltimore Police \nDepartment's current leadership has already taken steps to address the issues raised by this \nlawsuit and has engaged in diligent efforts to resolve this lawsuit in a positive and constructive \nmanner.  They applaud those efforts and the Department's willingness to take the additional \nsteps set forth in this agreement.  The Department recognizes that the individuals who brought \nthis lawsuit have focused their efforts on systemic reforms that the parties all believe will · \nimprove policing in Baltimore. \nThe parties have been engaged in this lawsuit for four years, and believe that it is in their \nbest interests, and the best interest of the community, to bring finality to the case.  The parties all \nwant to see a safer Baltimore, and all want effective and lawful policing.  We all believe that \npolice respect for the citizens they serve and adherence to the Constitution are essential to \nachievement of our collective goal of making our community a safer one.  The plaintiffs and the \nDepartment are gratified that this chapter has been brought to a close, and look forward to \nworking together to realize the promise of the settlement announced today. \n\"We think this agreement is an important step for the Baltimore City Police Department,\" \nsaid Dr. Marvin L. Cheatham, President of the Baltimore City Branch of the NAACP, \"and we \nappreciate the Police Commissioner's willingness to make these commitments\" \n\"I appreciate the hard work and creative thinking that was necessary to craft this \nAgreement, which is certainly in line with my overall mission for this Police Department,\" \nsaid Police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld, Ill, \"and the BPD will continue its efforts \nto strengthen its relationship with the citizens of Baltimore, and welcomes the valued \npartnership it continues to forge with the current leadership of the NAACP, which extends \nbeyond this Agreement.\" ",

CCB-05-1287\n:\nSUSAN MURPHY, et al. :\n...o0o...\nMEMORANDUM\nNow pending before the court is plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The plaintiffs\nseek to certify four classes of arrestees subjected to alleged unconstitutional policies or practices\nat the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center (“CBIC”). The defendants, current and\nformer wardens of CBIC, oppose the motion. The matter has been fully briefed, and oral\nargument was held on February 18, 2009. For the reasons articulated below, the plaintiffs’\nmotion will be granted in part and denied in part.\nBACKGROUND\nCBIC is the central location for booking and processing arrestees in Baltimore City. The\nplaintiffs assert that the defendants are liable for unconstitutional strip searches of arrestees as\nwell as unconstitutional overdetentions of arrestees at CBIC.1  The plaintiffs propose four\nclasses, each with a class period beginning May 12, 2002: (1) the overdetention class,\nrepresented by Kevin Adams, Tonia Bowie, Anthony Haig, and Michael Washington, consisting\n1Additional background of this litigation is set forth in the prior decisions of the court.\nSee Jones v. Murphy, 470 F.Supp.2d 537 (D. Md. 2007) (defendants’ motion to dismiss); Jones\nv. Murphy, 567 F.Supp.2d 787 (D. Md. 2008) (plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment).\nFamiliarity with those decisions is presumed.\n1\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 2 of 13\nof arrestees detained at CBIC for more than 48 hours after arrest without release or presentment\nbefore a judicial officer; (2) the suspicionless strip search class, represented by Anthony Haig,\nGary Saunders, Michael Washington, and Dana West, consisting of persons arrested for crimes\nnot involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, who were strip searched prior to or without\npresentment before a judicial officer;2 (3) the non-private strip search class, represented by\nAnthony Haig, Gary Saunders, Michael Washington, and Dana West, consisting of arrestees\nsubjected to strip searches at CBIC in the presence of other arrestees or staff not involved in the\nsearch prior to or without presentment before a judicial officer; and (4) the equal protection\nunderwear strip search class, represented by Kevin Adams, Gary Saunders, and Aaron Ross,\nconsisting of male arrestees at CBIC who were searched down to their underwear prior to or\nwithout presentment before a judicial officer while female arrestees were not.3 \nANALYSIS\nTo obtain class certification, the plaintiffs must meet all four requirements of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(a), and at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b). Gunnells v.\nHealthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 423 (4th Cir. 2003). The plaintiffs seek certification of the\nproposed classes under Rule 23(b)(3), which requires that common questions of law or fact\npredominate. \n2The plaintiffs define a strip search as “the removal, pulling down, or rearrangement of\nclothing for the visual inspection of a person’s genital and/or anal areas, which may also include\nrequiring the person to squat and cough, in the presence of one or more guards.” (Pls.’ Proposed\nClass Definitions at 2.)\n3The plaintiffs are no longer seeking certification of a fifth class: an equal protection strip\nsearch class composed of all males strip searched at CBIC while female arrestees were not. (Pls.’\nProposed Class Definitions at 3.)\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 3 of 13\nA. Rule 23(a)\nPursuant to Rule 23(a), for each class, the plaintiffs must satisfy the following elements:\n“(1) numerosity of parties; (2) commonality of factual and legal issues; (3) typicality of claims\nand defenses of class representatives; and (4) adequacy of representation.” Gunnells, 348 F.3d at\n423. The defendants do not challenge the plaintiffs’ ability to satisfy the first three Rule 23(a)\nrequirements, and the court will address them briefly. As to numerosity, the plaintiffs have put\nforth sufficient evidence that the proposed classes will number in the thousands and that joinder\nof all members is thus impracticable. The commonality and typicality requirements tend to\nmerge because they “[b]oth serve as guideposts for determining whether ... the named plaintiff's\nclaim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly\nand adequately protected....” Stott v. Haworth, 916 F.2d 134, 143 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting Gen.\nTel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.13 (1982)). The plaintiffs satisfy\ncommonality and typicality because in each proposed class there are common issues that are\ncentral to each of the named plaintiff’s and proposed class member’s claims: whether the\ndefendants implemented or were deliberately indifferent to a particular policy, practice, or\ncustom that offends the Constitution and was uniformly applied to all class members.  \nThe defendants raise some objections to the adequacy of representation, contending that\nthe named plaintiffs in the suspicionless strip search class, who had merely to remove their\nclothes, will not adequately represent those individuals who were subjected to full body cavity\nsearches and likely suffered greater damages. The court notes, however, that “the size of a\nnamed plaintiff's financial stake in the action is not the determinative issue; rather, the issue is\nwhether the named plaintiffs will adequately protect the interests of the class.” Bynum v. District\nof Columbia, 214 F.R.D. 27, 36 (D.D.C. 2003); see also In re Oxford Health Plans, 191 F.R.D.\n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 4 of 13\n369, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (“[T]here is no requirement in Rule 23 concerning the amount of loss\neither in gross or compared with the losses of others, necessary to qualify as a class\nrepresentative.”). The defendants offer only their own speculation that divergent interests will\nemerge regarding damage awards. As discussed below, in the event the defendants are held\nliable, the various options available for calculating damages permit variation according to\nparticularized injuries. Certainly, if unforeseen issues arise that compromise the adequacy of the\nnamed plaintiffs or their counsel to represent the class, the court can revisit the issue. But, at this\npoint, the court will not “base a finding of inadequate representation on [an] unfounded assertion\nthat the interests of the class members might potentially be at odds.” Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 36.\nThe court is satisfied with the adequacy of representation; the named plaintiffs’ interests are not\nopposed to those of the other class members and the class counsel is qualified, experienced, and\nable to conduct the litigation.\nB. Rule 23(b)(3)\nRule 23(b)(3) requires the court to find (1) that “questions of law or fact common to the\nmembers of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members” (the\npredominance requirement), and (2) that “a class action is superior to other available methods for\nthe fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy” (the superiority requirement). Fed.R.Civ.P.\n23(b)(3). The predominance requirement is similar to but “far more demanding” than Rule\n23(a)’s commonality requirement and “tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive\nto warrant adjudication by representation.” Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591,\n623-24 (1997); Lienhart v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 138, 146 n.4 (4th Cir. 2001). The\nsuperiority requirement ensures that “a class action is superior to other available methods for the\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 5 of 13\nfair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). Rule 23(b)(3) sets\nforth a number of factors a district court should consider in deciding whether a class action is\nsuperior to other available methods: (1) the individual interests of class members in controlling\nseparate litigation; (2) whether and to what extent proposed class members have already\ncommenced similar litigation; (3) the desirability of concentrating litigation in the particular\nforum; and, most importantly for purposes of this litigation, (4) the difficulties likely to be\nencountered in the management of a class action. Id.  The defendants challenge the plaintiffs’\nability to meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) for each proposed class.\ni. Overdetention Class\nThe plaintiffs contend, and the court agrees, that the predominant issues in determining\nthe defendants’ liability can be determined on a class-wide basis, including whether the\ndefendants held the class members more than 48 hours without presentment or release, whether\nthe defendants oversaw a practice of allowing presentment delays, and whether these alleged\noverdetentions violate the Constitution. The plaintiffs present sufficient evidence that\ndetermining who was detained more than 48 hours is a fairly straightforward factual inquiry that\ncan be culled from the State’s own information in its Automated Booking System.4  \nThe defendants argue that the individualized inquiries into whether there were legitimate\nreasons for the delays will predominate over common issues. The burden is on the defendants to\n4The plaintiffs contend that the defendants’ database provides the date and time of arrest\nand, in most cases, either the date and time of presentment or, for those released without charge,\nthe date and time of release. As for those cases where the presentment field is not populated, the\nplaintiffs rely on time-date scans showing the arrestee’s room-to-room movements at CBIC to\ndetermine who was there 48 hours before presentment.\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 6 of 13\ndemonstrate such a legitimate reason. See Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 57 (1991).\nConsidering that the federal law requiring presentment within 48 hours is twice as long as\nMaryland’s requirement of 24 hours, see Maryland Rule 4-212(f); Logan v. State, 425 A.2d 632,\n635 (Md. 1991), the court agrees with the plaintiffs that such individualized inquiries do not\nthreaten to predominate the common issues in this claim.5 \nThe only other significant issue regarding this claim is the remedy: the defendants\ncontend that if the plaintiffs succeed in establishing liability, the potential damage awards for the\nindividual class members may vary significantly and individualized inquiries into damages will\npredominate. The need for individualized damage decisions in class action litigation, however,\ndoes not necessarily preclude a finding that common questions of law and fact predominate over\nindividual issues on liability. See Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 428; see also Bynum, 219 F.R.D. at 39.\nThe court is satisfied that the aforementioned common issues of law and fact predominate.\nMoreover, it is unclear at this stage in the litigation what degree of individualization the\ndetermination of damages will require. See Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.\n2004); Johnson v. District of Columbia, 248 F.R.D. 46, 57 (D.D.C. 2008). While it is too early to\nrule on issues related to calculating damages, the court notes that the plaintiffs propose two\npotential methodologies, scaling damages based on the length of overdetention, or creating\nsubclasses distinguishing between individuals who were never charged, those charged but\nreleased on their own recognizance, and those held on a bond.\n5The plaintiffs have provided deposition testimony of a former assistant warden at CBIC\nclaiming that during his tenure he was able to maintain a swift booking process by continually\ntracking the booking queue and that it was unusual for an arrestee to be held more than 24 hours\nbefore presentment. (Pls.’ Reply Ex. 156 at 48-49, 142-43.) Such evidence suggests that any\nlegitimate reasons for delay will be limited.\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 7 of 13\nAs to the superiority requirement, the court agrees that a class action is superior to other\nforms of litigation to resolve this claim. Class treatment is appropriate in situations, such as here,\nwhere the individual claims of many of the putative class members are so small that it would not\nbe economically efficient for them to maintain individual suits. See, e.g., Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at\n40. In certifying a class of individuals alleging they had been unlawfully strip searched at a\ncounty detention facility, another judge in this court concluded that “resolution of the liability\nand damages issues within the context of a class action is far more efficient than individual\nprosecution of damages actions. A class action is also the fairest means to settle this controversy\nsince it is unlikely that most class members would pursue these claims on their own.” Smith v.\nMontgomery County, Md., 573 F.Supp. 604, 613 (D. Md. 1983). In this case, as in Bynum, both\nparties acknowledge that a number of individual class members who were allegedly overdetained\nstand to recover only a small amount of damages. The defendants assert, for example, that a\nnumber of those allegedly overdetained were committed to the Baltimore City Detention Center\nand thus the delay in presentment did not affect the overall length of detention. Accordingly, an\nindividual class member’s interest in controlling a separate action against the defendants appears\nlow. Further, given the relatively straightforward task of identifying class members, the court is\nsatisfied that no significant management issues will arise if this action is maintained as a class.\nLastly, litigation of all class members’ claims in the present forum is appropriate. \nIn light of the plaintiffs’ ability to satisfy all of the required elements, the court will\ncertify an overdetention class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3).  \nii. Suspicionless Strip Search Class \nHere again, the defendants primarily challenge the plaintiffs’ ability to satisfy the\n7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 8 of 13\npredominance requirement. Specifically, they argue that determining whether potential class\nmembers’ searches were or could have been conducted pursuant to reasonable suspicion – and\nthus were not illegal – will predominate over common questions of law and fact. Considering,\nhowever, that the proposed class is limited to individuals arrested on non-violent, non-drug, and\nnon-weapons offenses who were strip searched pursuant to a blanket policy, the court is not\nconvinced that individualized determinations regarding reasonable suspicion will predominate or\ncause the class litigation to become unmanageable. See In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases,\n461 F.3d 219, 229-30 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that the class definition, which included those\narrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses and strip searched pursuant to the\ndefendants’ blanket policy, avoided questions of probable cause in determining class\nmembership, and that a potential reasonableness defense, which in that case would be de\nminimis, as a general matter did not forestall class certification); Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 6 (noting,\nwhere strip search classes excluded those arrested for drugs, weapons or violent felonies, that if\nthere were a rule or custom to strip search every arrestee, “then it is a fair guess that most\narrestees . . . were strip searched on this basis,” and those who were not “may well not be\nnumerous”); McBean v. City of New York, 228 F.R.D. 487 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (concluding that\nwhere class membership was not defined with respect to the existence of reasonable suspicion,\nbut rather was defined as those searched pursuant to blanket policy, no evidentiary hearings\nwould be necessary to determine class membership). Rather, whether and for how long a strip\nsearch custom or policy existed, the constitutionality of that policy, and to whom the policy was\napplied are the predominant liability issues in the case of each proposed class member. See\nDodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D.177, 181-82 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). \nThe plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence such that a reasonable jury could find a\n8\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 9 of 13\nblanket strip search policy existed and was consistently applied by most if not all of the\ncorrectional officers at CBIC during the class period. The defendants, then, would carry the\nburden of demonstrating that a particular class member was or could have been lawfully strip\nsearched based on reasonable suspicion. See, e.g., In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461\nF.3d at 229-30; Dodge, 226 F.R.D. at 182 (concluding that whether a particular class member\ncould have been lawfully strip searched based on reasonable suspicion is a defense to a particular\nclass member's claim for damages); McBean, 228 F.R.D. at 503 (concluding that where class\nwas limited to plaintiffs arrested on non-narcotics and weapons-related offenses, individual\ndefenses to liability would be limited); Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis., 219 F.R.D. 607, 621-\n22 (W.D. Wis. 2003) (concluding that if the plaintiffs could establish liability, then the\ndefendants would have the burden to show that a particular search was reasonable, and, because\nthe class was limited to those arrested for misdemeanors or ordinance violations unrelated to\nweapons or illegal drugs, there likely would not be much evidence of reasonableness); Mack v.\nSuffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 24 (D. Mass. 2000) (“To require Plaintiff to prove that each\nindividual search was unsupportable, as well as indiscriminate, would be unnecessary and unfair.\nGiven that these [individuals] were routinely strip-searched, the burden rests on Defendants to\ndemonstrate that particular searches were reasonable.”).6\nThe defendants further argue that individual issues of class membership will predominate\nbecause of conflicting testimony among the guards as to who among them conducted\nindiscriminate strip searches and during what time periods the searches were conducted. It is\n6The court need not determine at this point whether the defense arises as to liability or\ndamages and notes that it is largely irrelevant in this case because the defendants do not maintain\nrecords establishing which arrestees, if any, were searched pursuant to a reasonable suspicion\nthat they possessed contraband. Lacking any such evidence, a viable defense seems unlikely.\n9\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 10 of 13\nundisputed that the defendants did not keep records as to which arrestees were strip searched;\nhowever, if the defendants maintained a blanket strip search practice, then evidence suggesting\nthat one or two guards strayed from that practice will not defeat class certification. See, e.g.,\nBlihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 618 (certifying the plaintiff class on the issue of the defendants’ liability\nwhere the defendants offered the testimony of one deputy sheriff who claimed she did not\nconduct strip searches absent probable cause); Doe v. Calumet City, 754 F.Supp. 1211, 1215 n.8\n(N.D. Ill. 1990) (deciding defendants’ liability for strip search policy on class wide basis where\nclass consisted of all women arrested on a misdemeanor or ordinance violation and defendants\npresented testimony of three dispatchers claiming they did not strip search all arrestees); see also\nDodge, 226 F.R.D. at 182 (rejecting the defendants’ contention that whether an officer correctly\napplied the alleged policy would predominate noting that “[t]he only way to apply such a policy\nincorrectly is to fail to strip search a newly-arrived detainee” and such a person, by definition, is\nnot a member of the class). As noted above, based on the evidence presented to the court, a\nreasonable jury could find that a blanket strip search custom, practice, or policy existed and that\nit was consistently applied – the predominant issues for all class members. The burden is again\non the defendants to present sufficient evidence that particular arrestees were not subjected to the\nblanket policy.7\nLastly, the defendants contend that individual issues as to damages will predominate. As\ndiscussed above, individualized damages do not necessarily preclude certification. A number of\nfederal courts that have considered this argument have certified strip search classes despite the\n7According to the plaintiffs, it would be possible, using the defendants’ database, to\nexclude individuals from the class who were searched by a particular officer shown not to have\napplied the alleged blanket strip search policy. (See Pls.’ Class Cert. Mem. Ex. 124 ¶ 13.) \n10\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 11 of 13\npotential for individualized damage determinations. See, e.g., Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 6; Johnson,\n248 F.R.D. at 57; Blihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 621; Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 25. Moreover, as noted\nabove, it may not be necessary to proceed with individualized damage determinations. If such\nindividualized determinations are required, the court can select from a number of options such as\n“(1) bifurcating liability and damage trials with the same or different juries; (2) appointing a\nmagistrate judge or special master to preside over individual damages proceedings; (3)\ndecertifying the class after the liability trial and providing notice to class members concerning\nhow they may proceed to prove damages; (4) creating subclasses; or (5) altering or amending the\nclass.” See Carnegie v. Household Int’l, Inc., 376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004). The plaintiffs\nhave proposed using a damages matrix such that a jury could set a schedule of damages for class\nmembers or using statistical sampling to try damages on a class-wide basis. The court reserves\nruling on the propriety of damages methodologies at this stage in the litigation, but is satisfied\nthat common issues predominate for purposes of class certification. \nAs to superiority, the court reiterates its findings with regard to the overdetention claim,\nas the issues are largely similar. Here again, an individual class member’s interest in controlling\na separate action against the defendants appears to be relatively low, and this is a proper forum\nfor litigating all of the class members’ claims. This court’s discussion of the efficiency and\nfairness of class action litigation in Smith is particularly relevant because that case involved a\nblanket strip search policy. While manageability issues are more likely to arise in this context\ndue to the issues involved in identifying class members, the court is not convinced that they will\noverwhelm or undermine the inherent advantages of class action litigation. See, e.g., Blihovde,\n219 F.R.D at 622.\nIn light of the plaintiffs’ ability to satisfy all of the required elements, the court will\n11\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 12 of 13\ncertify a suspicionless strip search class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3).  \n \niii. Equal Protection Underwear Strip Search and Non-Private Strip Search Classes \nBoth of these proposed classes would likely number in the hundreds of thousands, as they\nwould include nearly all male arrestees brought to CBIC during the proposed class period. (See\nPls.’ Class Cert. Mem. at 26.) While common questions of law and fact likely predominate as to\nboth claims, the manageability issues that will inevitably arise from certifying classes of such\nenormity seeking non-economic damages outweigh the potential benefits of certification. The\nplaintiffs acknowledge that the individual claims are small and, while the court agrees that class\nactions serve the purpose of aggregating these sorts of claims that otherwise may not be litigated\nindividually, the court does not see the wisdom in certifying a class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3)\nwhen the individual claims are small and the potential for manageability problems, including the\nprovision of adequate notice, are particularly high. Further, the court notes that none of the\nnamed class representatives were charged with drugs, weapons, or violent felony offenses,\nwhereas a substantial number, perhaps a majority, of the members of these proposed classes\nwere charged with such crimes. While the privacy and equal protection rights are not controlled\nby the type of offense charged, nonetheless, such variation in circumstances between the named\nplaintiffs and the proposed class members raises concerns regarding the typicality and adequacy\nof representation requirements of Rule 23(a), while these requirements were easily satisfied by\nthe more homogeneous overdetention and suspicionless strip search classes. Accordingly, the\ncourt will deny the plaintiffs’ motion to certify the equal protection underwear strip search class\n12\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 270   Filed 03/19/09   Page 13 of 13\nand the non-private strip search class.8\nCONCLUSION\nAs discussed above, the court will grant the plaintiffs’ motion to certify the overdetention\nand suspicionless strip search classes pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) and will deny the motion as to\nthe equal protection underwear strip search and non-private strip search classes. The court\nreserves the right to revisit this decision if unforeseen problems arise making class certification\nwith respect to liability or damages inappropriate.

S 1983 action involves strip searches of\narrestees in the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center.\nThe district court granted defendants' motions for summary\njudgment on the grounds of qualified immunity. Jones v. Murphy,\n2013 WL822372, at *6 (D. Md. Mar. 5, 2013). We now affirm.\n1.\nA.\nThe named plaintiffs are men who went through the booking\nprocess at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center in\nBaltimore, Maryland (\"Central Booking\" ) They represent a\ncertified class of persons who were arrested between May 12,\n2002, and April 30, 2008, \"(a) on charges [or in cases] not\ninvolving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, and (b) strip\nsearched (c) prior to or without presentment before a court\ncommissioner or other judicial officer.\" Jones v. Murphy, 2013\nWL 822372, at *3 (D. Md. Mar. 5, 2013). The district court\ndefined a strip search as \"the removal, pulling down, or\nrearrangement of clothing for the visual inspection of a\nperson's genital and/or anal areas, which may also include\nrequiring the person to squat and cough, in the presence of one\nor more guards.\" Id. The defendants are two former wardens of\nCentral Booking.\n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 6 of 25\nAppeal: 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed: 11/14/2014 Pg: 4 of 21\nCentral Booking opened in 1995. The facility has two\nsections: the booking area and the housing unit. Only activities\non the booking floor are at issue in this case.\nAfter an individual is arrested in Baltimore, a t'ransport\nofficer brings him or her to Central Booking. Each arrestee\nenters the facility through a gender-specific sallyport, where\nan officer searches the arrestee with a metal detector and a\npat-down. The sallyport officer puts a color-coded wristband on\nthe arrestee. Scanning the barcode on the wristband allows an\nofficer to view the arrestee's name, the charge, which officer\narrested him, as well as the date, time, and location of the\narrest. Some arrestees already have wristbands when they arrive;\nothers come only with a \"toe tag,ffwhich is a form listing the\ninformation that will be connected to the barcode. The sallyport\nofficer also conducts a brief medical examination of the\narrestee.\nFollowing that, arrestees proceed to a search room where\nofficers conduct a more thorough search, bagging and\ninventorying any personal property. Plaintiffs allege that at\nthis stage of the process correctional officers conducted strip\nsearches of the type described by the class certification order.\nIn order to conduct the search, officers remove arrestees'\nhandcuffs or flex-cuffs, which generally remain off for the\nremainder of the booking procedure. From the search room, an\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 7 of 25\nAppeal: 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed 11/14/2014 Pg: 5 of 21\nofficer guides the arrestee to an intake window, where an intake\nofficer inputs toe~tag information into the computer system and\nasks medical questions. An officer then escorts the arrestee to\nanother room to be fingerprinted and photographed. Eventually,\nthe arrestee is either brought before a commissioner or released\nwithout charge.\nBetween the v\"arious stages of the booking process,\narrestees may be held in holding rooms with other arrestees.\nThey remain in holding rooms while they wait to see a court\ncommissioner, which under Maryland law must occur within 24\nhours of the arrest. Md. Rule 4-2l2(f). Officers do not separate\narrestees by crime of arrest or criminal history. In fact,\nofficers often know only what is on the toe-tag, and even the\nname given on the toe-tag (and in the computer system) may be an\nalias. It is not until after the fingerprinting stage that\nofficers have access to the arrestee's criminal history and any\noutstanding warrants. The holding rooms may contain up to 25\narrestees at a time, but over the course of his stay in Central\nBooking an arrestee may share a room with many more than 25\nothers because of the ingress and egress of people in any given\nholding room. The four named plaintiffs shared rooms with 55,\n36, 35, and 20 different persons, respectively, who had been\narrested for a variety of crimes, including firearm violations,\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 8 of 25\nAppeal 13-2014 Doc 51 Filed 11/14/2014 Pg: 6 of 21\ndrug crimes, assault, burglary, automobile theft, and armed\nrobbery.\nAll told, Central Booking processed an average of 229\narrestees per day during the class period. Each arrestee\ninevitably interacted with many other arrestees during his stay,\nincluding those charged with both minor and serious offenses.\nRoughly three-quarters of class members were not committed to\nthe housing unit, but in total only 51% of all arrestees were\nreleased either before or after seeing a court commissioner.\nTherefore, plaintiffs had \"substantial contact with other\ndetainees, including some who were later admitted to general\npopulation\" of the housing unit.

The Fourth Amended Complaint\nconsisted of twelve counts and sought certification of five\nseparate class actions. This appeal concerns only Count 1, which\nthe district court certified under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 54(b). In 2007, the district court initially denied\ndefendants' motions to dismiss, holding that the wardens were\nnot entitled to qualified immunity because \"the right of those\narrested for offenses not likely to involve weapons or\ncontraband to be free from strip searches without any\nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion appears to be\nclearly established\" in the Fourth Circuit.

Md.. Mar. 5, 2013), that\nFlorence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington,\n132 s. Ct. 1510 (2012), demonstrates that the law was not\nclearly established even though that decision came several years\nafter the close of the class period.\nThe relevant question, however, is whether the law was\nclearly established as of the time of the search. Reichle v.\nHowards, 132 s. Ct. 2088, 2093 (2012) (examining the state of\nthe law \"at the time of [the] arrest\"); al-Kidd, 131 s.

Forsyth, 472 u.s.\n511, 535 (1985) (\"The decisive fact is that the question\nwas open at the time he acted.\")\nThis temporal element inheres in qualified immunity because\nthe inquiry into \"clearly established law\" is tethered to the\nneed for notice. Public officials, no less than private\ncitizens, are entitled to know when their actions violate the\nlaw. Notice means prior notice, not notice after the fact.\n11\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 14 of 25\nAppeal: 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed: 11/14/2014 Pg: 12 of 21\nReichle, 132 s.

In\nsome instances, the law may change for the apparent benefit of\ngovernment officials. But though such a change in law may\nindicate that there was no constitutional violation on the\nmerits, it does not affect whether the law was clearly\nestablished because the favorable judicial decision could not\nhave informed the officials' understanding of whether their\nactions were unlawful. Of course the need for prior notice is a\ntwo-way street. It is just as likely that a later-in-time\njudicial decision could clearly establish the illegality of the\nconduct in question. But later-in-time is not at the time, and\n12\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 15 of 25\nAppeal: 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed: 11/14/2014 Pg: 13of 21\nprescience is not to be presumed in granting or withholding the\nimmunity.\nThe Supreme Court decided Florence on April 2, 2012. See\n132 S. Ct. at 1510. The class period in this case ran from May\n12, 2002, until April 30, 2008. Jones, 2013 WL822372, at *3. As\nFlorence came down almost four years after the class period\nclosed, it does not demonstrate that the law on jail strip\nsearches either was or was not clearly established at the time\nthese alleged searches were conducted.\nIII.\nPlaintiffs rely on Logan v. Shealy, 660 F. 2d 1007 (4th Cir.\n1981), and cite Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356 (4th Cir. 2001),\nand Abshire v. Walls, 830 F.2d 1277 (4th Cir. 1987), to assert\nthat during the class period it was clearly established that\nstrip searches of the type performed in Central Booking were\nunconstitutional. Logan, Arnaechi, and Abshire, however, do not\nclearly establish that the wardens' alleged conduct was\nunlawful.\nIn Logan, this court utilized the balancing test of Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520(1979), to find that a jail strip search\nwas unreasonable and thus a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n660 F. 2d at 1013. Bell instructs courts to \"consider the scope\nof the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is\nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in\n13\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 16 of 25\nAppeal: 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed: 11/14/2014 Pg: 14 of 21\nwhich it is conducted.\" 441 U.S. at 559. Logan had been arrested\nfor driving while intoxicated and brought before a magistrate,\nwho issued an arrest warrant and ordered her released on her own\nrecognizance after a period of four hours (so she could sober\nup) or as soon as someone could pick her up. 660 F.2d at 1009-\n10. A sheriff's deputy, however, refused to let her call a\nfriend until she had been strip-searched. Id. at 1010. That\nsearch took place in a holding room with a window with the\n'blinds raised, such that her naked body was \"exposed to the\ngeneral view of persons known to be in the vicinity.\" Id. at\n1014.\nThe court held that the search was unconstitutional,\nreasoning:\nOn the undisputed and stipulated evidence, Logan's\nstrip search bore no such discernible relationship to\nsecurity needs at the Detention Center tha~, when\nbalanced against the ultimate invasion of personal\nrights involved, it could reasonably be thought\njustified. At no time would Logan or similar detainees\nbe intermingled with the general jail population; her\noffense, though not a minor traffic offense, was\nnevertheless one not commonly associated by its very\nnature with the possession of weapons or contraband;\nthere was no cause in her specific case to believe\nthat she might possess either; and when strip-\nsearched, she had been at the Detention Center for one\nand one-half hours without even a pat-down search.\nId. at 1013. The court emphasized the lack of privacy in the\nlocation where the search was performed. Id. at 1014.\n14\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 17 of 25\nAppeal: 13-2014 Doc 51 Filed: 11/14/2014 Pg: 15of 21\nLogan is a far cry from this case. Unlike in Logan, Central\nBooking officers conduct the thorough searches in a dedicated\nsearch room, not a holding room with a transparent window.\nMoreover, defendants here have pointed to, and the district\ncourt has recognized, Jones v. Murphy, 2013 WL822372, at *2 (D.\nMd. Mar. 5, 2013), significant security justifications for the\nsearches allegedly conducted. Preventing the smuggling of drugs,\nweapons, and other contraband into a detention facility is a\nlegitimate justification, especially where arrestees such as the\nplaintiffs mingle with dozens of other arrestees for up to 24\nhours. There was no comparable security justification -- indeed\nno credible justification at all advanced in Logan's case.\nShe was set to leave the jail shortly, and presumably without\ninteracting with other arrestees. In analyzing qualified\nimmunity we are required to define the right in question \"at a\nhigh level. of particularity,\" Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178\nF.3d 231, 251 (1999), and be mindful of the \"specific context of\nthe case,\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001). In the\ncontext of Central Booking, it was not \"sufficiently clear that\nevery reasonable official would have understood that what he is\ndoing\" failed the Bell test and contravened Logan. Ashcroft v.\nal-kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2083 (2011) (citation, quotation\nmarks, and alterations omitted).\n15\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 18 of 25\nAppeal 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed: 11/14/2014 Pg: 16 of21\nFor similar reasons, neither Amaechi nor Abshire clearly\nestablished that the Central Booking searches were\nunconsti tutional. In Amaechi, police officers arrested a woman\nfor a noise violation that occurred two days prior. 237 F.3d at\n359. She was wearing only a light dress that was missing buttons\nso it could not close below the chest unless she held it shut.\nId. at 359 n.7. The police refused to let her change; when they\nhandcuffed her, she was left essentially naked. Id. at 359. An\nofficer then proceeded to physically search her in front of her\nhome; he \"squeezed her hips, and inside her opened dress,\n'swiped' one ungloved hand, palm up, across her bare vagina, at\nwhich time the tip of his finger slightly penetrated Amaechi's\ngenitals,H and then \"knead[ed]H her buttocks with his hand. Id.\nThere is no comparison between Central Booking and the\nphysically and sexually abusive search of Amaechi, which \"took\nplace directly in front of the Amaechis' townhouse, where the\nother police officers, Amaechi's husband, her five children, and\nall of her neighbors had the opportunity to observe. Id. at\nH\n360.\nIn Abshire, the strip search of the male arrestee was\nperformed in a utility room with the door open so that more than\na half dozen police officers, including one woman, viewed it.\n830 F.2d at 1279-80. The officers had not even done a pat-down\nof Abshire; the strip search appeared to have been conducted in\n16\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 19 of 25\nAppeal: 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed: 11/14/2014 Pg: 17 of 21\nretaliation for Abshire's repeated request to make a phone call.\nId. The weak justifications for the search did not outweigh the\nmanner in which the officers conducted the search. Id. at 1280.\nAnd the contact with large numbers of variously charged\narrestees that is present in this case was nowhere mentioned in\nAbshire.\nWe do not require that a prior case be identical to the\ncase at bar for fair notice to be provided. See Hope v. Pelzer,\n536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002). But\" 'in the light of pre-existing law\nthe unlawfulness must be apparent.'\" Id. (quoting Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)). Under the Bell balancing\ntest, the searches in Logan, Amaechi, and Abshire were\nunconstitutional because there were no security reasons strong\nenough to justify the intrusive and public nature of the\nsearches. The searches allegedly performed at Central Booking,\nhowever, were conducted in a different and less public setting\nthan those described by our precedents, and the security\njustifications for the Central Booking searches were more\ncompelling. We do not address the constitutional merits of these\nsearches. But \"[g] iven such an undeveloped state of the law,\"\nthe immunity defense does not permit us to tax correctional\nofficers with clairvoyance. Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 617\n(1999) .\n17\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 20 of 25\nAppeal 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed: 11/14/2014 Pg: 18 of 21\nIV.\nThe district court ultimately was correct that the\ndefendants are entitled to qualified immunity because the law\ndid not clearly establish at the time that the searches were\nconducted that they were unlawful.\nAFFIRMED\n18\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 21 of 25\nAppeal: 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed: 11/14/2014 Pg: 19 of 21\nWYNN,Circuit Judge, concurring:\nI concur in the well-reasoned majori ty opinion. I write\nseparately to underscore the importance of addressing the\nlegali ty of strip searching detainees held outside the general\npopulation in the appropriate case.\nIn Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of\nBurlington, the Supreme Court left open the question of whether\nstrip searching detainees held outside the general population\nwould be constitutional. 132 S. Ct. 1510, 1511 (2012) (\"[T]he\ncontroversy concerns whether every detainee who will be admitted\nto the general population may be required to undergo a close\nvisual inspection while undressed.\") (emphasis added). The\nsplintered Florence decision included two concurrences and a\nstrongly worded dissent, each of which expressed unease with the\nindiscriminate strip searching of detainees held outside of the\ngeneral population. See id., 132 S.Ct. at 1523 (Roberts, C.J.,\nconcurring); id. at 1524 (Alito, J., concurring); id. at 1525\n(Breyer, J., joined by Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ.,\ndissenting)\nThus, in Florence, the Supreme Court staked out an\nimportant limitation to its holding. Florence does not apply to\nstrip searches of detainees held outside of the general\npopulation. It now falls to us to apply the Constitution and\nrelevant precedent to those cases that Florence does not\n19\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 479   Filed 11/14/14   Page 22 of 25\nAppeal: 13-2014 Doc: 51 Filed 11/14/2014 Pg: 20 of 21\ncontrol. Clearly, as this Court holds today, our ruling in\nLogan v. Shealy does not put officers on reasonable notice as to\nthe limits the Constitution places on strip searches under the\ncircumstances of this case. 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir.\n1981) .\nThis Circuit has held that it is appropriate to address the\nconsti tutional merits in a qualified immunity case where doing\nso would \"clarify and elaborate upon our prior jurisprudence in\nimportant and necessary ways.\" See Doe ex reI.

There\ncan be no question that our jurisprudence in this area needs\nclarification and elaboration.\nUnfortunately, by not reaching the constitutional merits in\nthis matter, we leave corrections officers adrift in uncharted\nwaters.

The only grounds for an extension of time to file a petition for rehearing are\nthe death or serious illness of counselor a family member (or of a party or family\nmember in pro se cases) or an extraordinary circumstance wholly beyond the\ncontrol of counselor a party proceeding without counsel.\nEach case number to which the petition applies must be listed on the petition to\nidentifY the cases to which the petition applies and to avoid companion cases\nproceeding to mandate during the pendency of a petition for rehearing in the lead\ncase. A timely filed petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc stays the\nmandate and tolls the running of time for filing a petition for writ of certiorari.\nA petition for rehearing must contain an introduction stating that, in counsel's\njudgment, one or more ofthe following situations exist: (1) a material factual or\nlegal matter was overlooked; (2) a change in the law occurred after submission of\nthe case and was overlooked; (3) the opinion conflicts with a decision of the U.S.\nSupreme Court, this court, or another court of appeals, and the conflict was not\naddressed; or (4) the case involves one or more questions of exceptional\nimportance.

A timely petition\nfor rehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or motion to stay the mandate will stay\nissuance of the mandate. If the petition or motion is denied, the mandate will issue 7\ndays later.

Maryland.\nJanuary 4, 2007.\n555553344489012 *538*539*540*541*542 Sean Robert Day, Law Office of Sean R. Day, College Park, MD, Barrett S. Litt, Litt\nEstuar Harrison Miller and Kitson LLP, Los Angeles, CA, William Charles Claiborne, III, Law Offices of William\nClaiborne, Washington, DC, for Eric Jones, et al.\nKarl Aram Pothier, State of Maryland Office of the Attorney General Public Safety and Correctional Services,\nJoshua Neal Auerbach, Baltimore City Department Of Law, Baltimore, MD, Kim Yvette Johnson, Laurel, MD, for\nSusan Murphy, et al.\nMEMORANDUM\nBLAKE, District Judge.\nThe plaintiffs in this case bring constitutional claims against the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\"City\"), the\n[1]\nBaltimore City Police Department (\"BPD\"), collectively \"the City defendants,\"  and current and former wardens\n[2] [3]\n (\"Wardens\") of the Central Booking and Intake Center (\"CBIC\"), collectively \"the State defendants,\"  for\nalleged mistreatment of people arrested and taken to CBIC for booking and processing. The plaintiffs allege two\ngeneral areas of unconstitutional treatment of arrestees while at CBIC: strip searches and \"over detention\". Three\nmotions are now pending before the court: (1) the City defendants' motion to dismiss the third amended\ncomplaint; (2) the State defendants' motion to dismiss the third amended complaint or alternatively for summary\njudgment; and (3) the plaintiffs' motion to deny the State defendants' motion for summary judgment or\nalternatively to permit discovery. These motions have been fully briefed, and pursuant to Local Rule 105.6, no\nhearing is necessary. For the reasons set forth below, the State defendants' motion will be treated as a motion to\ndismiss and will be denied, with certain exceptions; the City defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted in its\nentirety.\nBACKGROUND\nThe plaintiffs bring this case as a class action, with a proposed class period of May 12, 2003 until final judgment\nin this case, although no motion for class certification has yet been filed. There are eight named plaintiffs: (1) Eric\nJones, arrested for second degree assault and false imprisonment (3d Am.Compl. ¶ 33); (2) Dana West, arrested\nfor leaving the scene of an accident (id. at ¶ 25); (3) Gary Saunders, who has multiple arrests during the\nproposed class period, including but not limited to misdemeanor theft, trespassing, and open alcohol containers,\nand has been arrested more than fifty times since CBIC opened in 1995 (id. at ¶¶ 50-51); (4) Anthony Haig, who\nwas arrested for re-selling Orioles tickets and failed to appear for his court hearing, thus there is an active bench\n[4]\nwarrant for his arrest (id. at ¶¶ 60, 69); (5) Michael Washington, arrested for public urination  (id. at ¶ 70); (6)\n543 Kevin Adams, arrested for *543 an open alcohol container (id. at 11 79); (7) Tonia Bowie, arrested for driving with\na suspended license (id. at ¶ 42); and (8) David Colyns, arrested for possessing a pocket knife and needle\nparaphernalia (id. at ¶ 46).\n[5]\nThe plaintiffs propose five classes: (1) the suspicionless strip search  class, consisting of those who have been\nor will be arrested for crimes not involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, who were strip searched by CBIC\n\n[6]\nemployees without any individualized finding that they were harboring weapons, drugs, or other contraband  (id.\nat ¶ 9); (2) the non-private strip search class, consisting of those who have been or will be subjected to strip\n[7]\nsearches at CBIC with other arrestees present  (id. at ¶ 12); (3) the equal protection strip search class,\n[8]\nconsisting of male arrestees strip searched at CBIC while female arrestees are not  (id. at 11 14); (4) the\n[9]\nunderwear strip search  class, consisting of male arrestees subjected to an underwear strip search while at.\n[10]\nCBIC while female arrestees are not  (id. at ¶ 16); and (5) the over detention class, consisting of those\narrested without warrants who have been or will be detained for an unreasonable length of time (more than 48\n[11]\nhours) before presentment to a judicial officer for a determination of probable cause  (id. at ¶ 18). Plaintiff Eric\nJones also brings an individual claim against former Warden Murphy and the City defendants based on being\ndetained for more than 36 hours prior to presentment. (Id. at ¶¶ 346-47, 358.)\nEach class, as well as Plaintiff Jones, brings claims against both the State and City defendants. The plaintiffs'\ngeneral theories are as follows: CBIC has both a policy and a practice of unconstitutional strip searches, as well\nas a practice of unconstitutional over detentions. The State defendants are liable both for establishing this policy\nand for being deliberately indifferent to their staffs unconstitutional practices. (Id. at ¶¶ 151-65, 173-81.) These\nconstitutional violations were and are known to City defendants, who nonetheless have continued to transport\narrestees there rather than pursuing alternatives, such as issuing citations for minor offenses instead of making\narrests. (Id. at ¶¶ 127, 165-72, 182-86.) Such aggressive arrest policies and practices result in large numbers of\narrestees being taken to CBIC, thereby exacerbating its already, overcrowded conditions. (Id. at ¶¶ 110-18.) The\nCity defendants are thus liable under a theory of \"entrustment liability\", as they have placed arrestees into the\n544 custody of an entity where the constitutional violations *544 were known to them. (Id. at ¶¶ 167-72,182-86.)\nAll claims are brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the plaintiffs seek both damages and equitable relief. Claims\nagainst the State defendants regarding suspicionless strip searches, non-private strip searches, and over\n[12]\ndetentions (Counts 1, 2, 4, 9 ) allege violations of the Fourth Amendment. (Id. at ¶¶ 251, 264, 291, 351.)\nClaims against the City defendants in these areas (Counts 5, 6, 8,10), allege violations of the Fourth and\n[13]\nFourteenth Amendments. (Id. at ¶¶ 311, 322, 344, 366.) Equal protection claims  against the State defendants\n(Counts 3, 11) are brought under the Fourteenth Amendment (id. at ¶¶ 285, 378), while equal protection claims\nagainst the City defendants (Counts 7, 12) are brought under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments (id. at ¶¶\n333, 391).\nANALYSIS\n\"The purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is to test the sufficiency of a complaint; importantly, a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion does not resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.\" \nEdwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\nWhen ruling on such a motion, the court must \"accept the well-pled allegations of the complaint as true,\" and\n\"construe the facts and reasonable inferences derived therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\" Ibarra\nv. United States, 120 F.3d 472, 474 (4th Cir.1997). Consequently, a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) may\nbe granted only when \"it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim\nwhich would entitle him to relief.\" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); see\nalso Edwards, 178 F.3d at 244. To survive a motion to dismiss, however, a complaint must \"in light of the nature\nof the action . . . sufficiently allege each element of the cause of action so as to inform the opposing party of the\nclaim and its general basis.\" Chao v. Rivendell Woods, Inc., 415 F.3d 342, 348 (4th Cir.2005). In addition,\nbecause the court is testing the legal sufficiency of the claims, the court is not bound by the plaintiffs legal\nconclusions. See, e.g., Young v. City of Mount Ranier, 238 F.3d 567, 577 (4th Cir.2001) (noting that the \"presence\n. . . of a few conclusory legal terms does not insulate a complaint from dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)\" when the\nfacts alleged do not support the legal conclusions).\nState Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or Alternatively for Summary Judgment\nStrip Search Claims (Fourth & Fourteenth Amendment Violations)\n\nThe strip search claims are not subject to dismissal, as the plaintiffs state claims for which relief could be granted.\n[14]\nSee Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356, 364-65 (4th Cir.2001) (holding unconstitutional the strip search of an\n545 arrestee for a noise violation who did not pose a danger to the officers) (citing Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d *545\n1007, 1013-14 (4th Cir.1981) (holding blanket strip search policy regardless of underlying offense unconstitutional\nand deciding that \"as a matter of law, no police officer in this day and time could reasonably believe that\nconducting a strip search in [a non-private area] . . . is a constitutionally valid [search].\")); Mary Beth G. v. City of\nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1274 (7th Cir.1984) (strip searching all women but not similarly situated men violates\nEqual Protection Clause).\nOver Detention Claims (Plaintiff Jones and Named Plaintiffs)\nJones now brings individual counts against both the City and State defendants for unreasonably long detention,\nalleging that he was held for \"at least 36 hours after his arrest without presentment.\" (3d Am.Compl. ¶¶ 40.) He is\nno longer a named plaintiff for the over detention claims. (Id. at ¶¶ 3-4.) The six named over detention plaintiffs all\nallege that they were detained for more than 48 hours without presentment following their arrests. (Id. at ¶ 18.)\nBoth Jones and the named plaintiffs state claims for which relief could be granted; indeed, the Wardens do not\nspecifically contest this. See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56-57, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 114 L.Ed.2d\n49 (1991) (establishing that presentment within 48 hours of arrest is presumptively constitutional but presentment\nwithin that time could still be found unconstitutional depending on the circumstances).\nSupervisory Liability Under § 1983\nThe Wardens argue that as there is no respondeat superior under § 1983, their liability for actions of CBIC\n[15]\nemployees can only rest upon a supervisory liability theory. (State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 3d Am. Compl.  at 8-9.)\nSupervisory liability may attach under § 1983 if a plaintiff can establish:\n(1) that the supervisor had actual or constructive knowledge that his subordinate was engaged in\nconduct that posed \"a pervasive and unreasonable risk\" of constitutional injury to citizens like the\nplaintiff; (2) that the supervisor's response to that knowledge was so inadequate as to show\n\"deliberate indifference to or tacit authorization of the alleged offensive practices[]\"; and (3) that\nthere was an \"affirmative causal link\" between the supervisor's inaction and the particular\nconstitutional injury suffered by the plaintiff.\nShaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, 799 (4th Cir.1994) (internal citations omitted). The Wardens contend that the\nplaintiffs' pleading is \"devoid of any facts supporting its many conclusory assertions\" regarding the three elements\nof supervisory liability, thus it should be dismissed for failing to state a claim. (State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 8.)\nExcept in very limited circumstances, \"the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a claimant to set out in\ndetail the facts upon which he bases his claim,\" Conley, 355 U.S. at 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, and a complaint need only\nsatisfy the \"simplified pleading standard\" of Rule 8(a)(2), Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 513, 122\nS.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). The Fourth Circuit has construed this standard as follows: \"a complaint meets\n[Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 8's requirements if, in light of the nature of the action, the complaint sufficiently\n546 alleges each element of the cause of action so as to inform the *546 opposing party of the claim and its general\nbasis.\" Chao, 415 F.3d at 348.\nThe plaintiffs have made sufficient allegations of supervisory liability under the Fourth Circuit's requirements to\n[16]\nsurvive this motion to dismiss.  First, the initial element of Shaw requires that a supervisor have knowledge\n(actual or constructive) of his subordinate behaving in a way that posed \"`a pervasive and unreasonable risk' of\nconstitutional injury.\" 13 F.3d at 799 (internal citations omitted). The subordinate's conduct must be \"'widespread\"'\nor, if not, it must have occurred on \"`several different occasions\"'. Randall v. Prince George's County, 302 F.3d\n188, 206 (4th Cir.2002) (internal citations omitted). Constructive notice can be alleged in multiple ways, including\nthe existence of written reports of conditions at a detention facility, or a supervisor's high level of responsibility\ncoupled with the violations alleged to have occurred on her or his watch. See Slakan v. Porter, 737 F.2d 368,\n374-75 (4th Cir.1984). In addition to alleging generally that the Wardens had actual and constructive notice, the\nplaintiffs specifically allege that widespread deficiencies at the, facility with respect to booking and managing\n\ninmates were documented in a series of reports, newspaper articles, and court cases dating back many years.\n(3d Am.Compl. ¶¶ 131.) They further note that the City, the Wardens' co-defendant in this suit, characterized\nCBIC \"as `dysfunctional' and lacking `appropriate or adequate management systems and practices to assure\nperformance and accountability\" in its complaint in Rodney, the state court challenge to over detention at CBIC. (\nId. at ¶ 134.) The plaintiffs also thoroughly set out allegations regarding the Wardens' authority and various duties\nof training, supervising, disciplining, and formulating and implementing policy (id. at ¶¶ 142-46), as well as the\nwidespread violations at CBIC (id. at ¶¶ 135, 147-64), thereby alleging constructive notice through this avenue as\nwell. Therefore, the plaintiffs have pled facts sufficient to satisfy the first element of Shaw.\nSecond, \"that the supervisor's response to that knowledge was so inadequate as to show `deliberate indifference\nto or tacit authorization of the alleged offensive practices,'\" is also sufficiently supported in the third amended\ncomplaint. Shaw, 13 F.3d at 799 (internal citations omitted). Under Shaw, \"[a] plaintiff may establish deliberate\nindifference by demonstrating a supervisor's `continued inaction in the face of documented widespread abuses,\"\nthus a plaintiff must allege facts supporting known widespread abuse coupled with supervisory non-\nresponsiveness to meet the pleading requirements on these factors. Id. (internal citations omitted). The plaintiffs\nhave alleged that the abuses were indeed documented and widespread, as discussed with respect to the first \nShaw factor, and that the Wardens failed to take measures to stop either the over detention or the strip searching\ndespite having the power to do so. (See, e.g., 3d. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 135 (widespread nature of violations), 147-50\n(over detention), 151-64 (strip searching)). Therefore, Plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to satisfy this prong\nof Shaw.\nThird, \"that there was an `affirmative causal link' between the supervisor's inaction and the particular\n547 constitutional *547 injury suffered by the plaintiff,\" is also adequately supported in the complaint. Shaw, 13 F.3d at\n799 (internal citations omitted). A supervisor \"is liable for the natural consequences of his actions.'\" Id. at 800\n[17]\n(internal citations omitted).  For each alleged constitutional violation, the plaintiffs allege that the wrongs were\ninflicted by CBIC staff. (See, e.g., 3d Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 27-31, 35-40, 43-44, 47-48, 52-58, 61-67, 71-77, 80-84.)\nAs set forth in the analysis of the first, and second prongs of Shaw, the plaintiffs allege that the Wardens had\nactual or constructive knowledge of such practices and did not stop them. There is thus a casual link alleged\nbetween the Wardens' allowing such practices to continue and the constitutional harms suffered by the plaintiffs\nas a result of these practices. The defendants' motion to dismiss based on failure to state a claim of supervisory\nliability will thus be denied.\nQualified Immunity\nThe Wardens also claim qualified immunity with respect to all allegations against them. Courts should attempt to\nresolve questions of qualified immunity as early in litigation as possible in order to spare those shielded by it\n\"from the burdens of litigation\". Pritchett v. Alford, 973 F.2d 307, 313 (4th Cir. 1992). The relevant test requires\n\"(1) identification of the specific right allegedly violated; (2) determining whether at the time of the alleged\nviolation the right was clearly established; and (3) if so, then determining whether a reasonable person in the\n[government official's] position would have known that doing what he did would violate that right.\" Id. at 312. The\nreasonableness standard here is an objective test. Id. This analysis must be done \"`at a high level of\nparticularity\", see Amaechi, 237 F.3d at 362 (citing Edwards, 178 F.3d at 250-51), thus the court must carefully\nconsider whether each of the five alleged violations was prohibited by clearly established law such that a\nreasonable official in the Wardens' position would have known that the alleged policies and actions were\nunconstitutional.\nFirst, the right of those arrested for offenses not likely to involve weapons or contraband to be free from strip\nsearches without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion appears to be clearly established. See \nLogan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (strip searching must be reasonable under the circumstances and was not reasonable\nwhen done to arrestee whose offense was not likely to involve weapons or contraband); Amaechi, 237 F.3d at\n365 (\"because West had no reason to believe that Amaechi posed a danger to the officers, and because Amaechi\nwas arrested for a misdemeanor noise violation, West should have known that his search of Amaechi similarly\nwas unjustified and therefore unconstitutional.\"); Abshire v. Walls, 830 F.2d 1277, 1279-80 (4th Cir.1987) (citing \nLogan and stating \"the standard in this circuit for judging the constitutionality of a strip search of a pre-trial\ndetainee is, firmly established\"). Even more specifically, it seems clear that it was not objectively reasonable for\n\nthe Wardens to believe that a blanket strip search policy, was lawful, especially when their position of authority is\nconsidered. See Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013-14 (explaining that \"[a]n indiscriminate strip search policy routinely\n548 applied to detainees [whose underlying offense is *548 unlikely to involve weapons or contraband] cannot be\nconstitutionally justified . . .\" and distinguishing the reasonableness of a policy-setting sheriff having believed a\npolicy to be, constitutional from that of an implementing deputy). See also Smith v. Montgomery County, 643\nF.Supp. 435, 439-43 (D.Md.1986) (holding that strip searching \"all felony arrestees, and all temporary detainees\narrested for misdemeanor offenses that involve weapons or contraband\" was constitutional but explaining that\nblanket strip search policy regardless of underlying offense was unconstitutional).\nSecond, being strip searched in a non-private setting also violates what, appears to be a clearly established right\nin the Fourth Circuit, and it was not reasonable for the Wardens to believe otherwise. See Amaechi, 237 F.3d at\n364 (\"we have repeatedly emphasized the necessity of conducting a strip search in private.\").\nThird, the right of males to be free from being strip searched (either fully or down to their underwear) while\nsimilarly situated females are not appears to be clearly established. Although there is no Supreme Court or\nFourth Circuit case directly on point, this does not mean that the right cannot be clearly established, as the\ndefendants suggest it does. (State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 18.) A right can be clearly established if it is \"manifestly\nincluded within more general applications of the core constitutional principle evoked.'\" Waterman v. Batton, 393\nF.3d 471, 476 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting Pritchett, 973 F.2d at 314). Whether a right has been clearly established,\neither through cases directly on point or by being encompassed within a core principle, may be found by looking\neither to \"controlling authority in the jurisdiction in question or . . . a `consensus of cases of persuasive authority\nsuch that a reasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful.'\" Waterman, 393 F.3d at. 476\n(quoting Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999)).\nFirst, there are cases from other jurisdictions that have addressed the issue of strip searching one gender but not\nthe other and have agreed that it is unconstitutional. See Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273-75 (rejecting the city's\npurported rationales for strip searching women but not men); Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F.Supp.2d 131, 150-51\n(D.Mass.2001) (holding that government failed to meet its burden for gender-based classification, citing Mary \nBeth G.); see also Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 WL 547116 *5-10 (N.D.Ill. 1998) (not reported) (finding policy of strip\nsearching women only violated Equal Protection Clause and ordering defendant to adopt remedy, citing Mary\nBeth G). These cases may be said to constitute a \"consensus of persuasive authority\".\nThe second, and arguably stronger, approach given the relatively small number of cases specifically on this topic,\nis that taken recently by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in which the right to be free\nfrom gender-based strip searches was found to be clearly encompassed by equal protection principles set out in\n[18]\ncontrolling cases.  In Johnson, et al. v. District of Columbia, et al., 2006 WL 3313754 (D.D.C. Nov.14, 2006)\n(Collyer, J.), a case alleging a policy of strip searching all female pre-presentment arrestees but not males, id. at\n549 50, the *549 court denied dismissal of the plaintiffs' equal protection claims despite the qualified immunity\ndefense asserted by the former U.S. Marshal, id. at 51. The court explained:\nAlthough there are no D.C. Circuit opinions addressing the exact conduct alleged here, relevant\nSupreme Court authority provides sufficiently clear guidance to government officials regarding the\nproper scope of strip searches of arrestees such as the putative class members [female pre-\npresentment arrestees]. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1979) (establishing a balancing test to determine whether a strip search is valid under the Fourth\nAmendment); U.S. v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996)\n(holding that governmental \" discrimination between males and females violates Equal Protection\nunless the government shows an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for the disparate\ntreatment). Based on these authorities, the Court finds that it would have been clear to any\nreasonable official in former Marshal Dillard's position that a blanket strip search policy under\nwhich all female 00 but not male 00 arrestees were strip searched, regardless of the offenses with\n97 97\nwhich they were charged or any individualized suspicion that they were concealing contraband,\n[19]\nwas unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\n\nId. at 50-51 (parts of internal citations omitted; italics in original). See also Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1274\n(relying on Supreme Court law to hold that a gender-based strip search policy was subject to scrutiny under the\nEqual Protection Clause). Therefore, the right to be free from gender-based strip searches was clearly\n[20]\nestablished in 2003.\nWith respect to the over detention claims, being detained for an unreasonable length of time (more than 48\nhours) without presentment is a clearly established violation of constitutional rights. See McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at\n56-57, 111 S.Ct. 1661. McLaughlin further established that the 48 hour threshold affects which party carries the\nburden, but does not automatically immunize pre-presentment detentions lasting less than 48 hours. See id.\nGiven that the facts of plaintiff Jones' detention have not yet been established, it would be premature to grant\ndefendants qualified immunity because Jones could still \"prove that his . . . probable cause determination was\ndelayed unreasonably.\" Id. at 57, 111 S.Ct. 1661.\nThe qualified immunity determination with respect to all strip search and over detention claims (both the named\nplaintiffs' and Jones') thus will ultimately turn on the development of the factual record. In conclusion, there are no\nqualified immunity grounds that bar proceeding with all claims against the Wardens at this time, although the\nissue may be raised again, if warranted, on summary judgment.\nClaims Against Warden Franks in His Individual Capacity\nThe Wardens point out, and the plaintiffs apparently concede, that there is no named plaintiff who claims to have\n550 suffered a constitutional violation during Warden *550 Franks' tenure. (Pls.' Opp'n State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at\n25-28.) The defendants therefore ask that claims against Franks in his individual capacity be dismissed. (State\nDefs.' Mot. Dismiss at 20.) Despite the likely truth of the plaintiffs' contention that they will find a named plaintiff\nas litigation proceeds, they cannot bring § 1983 claims for damages against Franks without identifying a plaintiff\n[21]\nwho states a cognizable claim against him. All claims against Warden Franks in his individual capacity  will\n[22]\ntherefore be dismissed.\nPlaintiffs' Standing to Obtain Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\nThe Wardens argue that the plaintiffs do not have standing to sue them in their official capacities for prospective\ninjunctive relief because the plaintiffs' assertion that they are \"reasonably likely to be re-admitted\" 00 i.e. arrested\n97\nagain 00 is insufficient. (State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 3-6.) To have standing to obtain equitable relief under § 1983,\n97\na plaintiff must make \"a showing of irreparable injury, a requirement that cannot be met where there is no\nshowing of any real or immediate threat that the plaintiff will be wronged again 00 a `likelihood of substantial and\n97\nimmediate irreparable injury.'\" City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675\n(1983) (internal citations omitted). The plaintiffs argue that named plaintiffs Saunders and Haig have standing\nbecause Saunders' history shows he is very likely to be re-arrested, and Haig has an outstanding bench warrant\nfor his arrest. (3d Am.Compl. ¶¶ 59, 69, 393.) I will address the situations of Saunders and Haig separately.\nSaunders has indeed been frequently admitted to CBIC, and common sense suggests that he is likely to be\narrested and taken there again. Courts generally are reluctant to find the requisite level of likelihood of future\nharm when standing is asserted based on repeat run-ins with the law or on being arrested again. See, e.g., Honig\nv. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 320, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 496-98, 94\nS.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974); Lyons, 461 U.S. at 103, 103 S.Ct. 1660; Slade v. Hampton Roads Regional\nJail, 407 F.3d 243, 249 (4th Cir.2005); Lynch v. Leis, 382 F.3d 642, 647-48 (6th Cir.2004). The existence of a\nclass, however, could alter the analysis. See Slade, 407 F.3d at 249 (distinguishing application of the \"capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review\" doctrine in class actions and individual actions) (internal quotations omitted); see\nalso id. at n. 4 (noting possible exception to mootness principles \"where the plaintiff introduces evidence that he\nhas been detained `on more than one occasion'\") (citing Demery v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d 1020, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(creating such an exception)); see also Lewis v. Tully, 99 F.R.D. 632, 639, 644-45 (N.D.Ill.1983) (explaining that\n\"though the issues of `mootness' and `standing' . . . typically arise at different stages of a lawsuit, the essential\ninquiry is indistinguishable\" and finding standing for injunctive relief for class of prisoners because \"new persons\nwith `live' claims for injunctive relief . . . are constantly entering the category of those subject to defendants'\n551 alleged practice,\" irrespective of *551 named plaintiffs ability to obtain standing for injunctive relief individually)\n\n[23]\n(internal citations omitted).  The issue of Saunders' standing is thus properly considered in the context of class\ncertification, if such a motion is made, rather than at the present time.\nHaig is in a different situation due to the outstanding bench warrant for his arrest for failing to appear at his court\nhearing, for re-selling Orioles tickets. (3d Am.Compl. ¶¶ 60, 69.) Haig currently resides in California (id. at cover\npage), where the Governor has a statutory duty \"to have arrested and delivered up to the executive authority of\nany other State any person charged in that State with treason, felony, or other crime, who has fled from justice\nand is found in this State\" (Cal.Penal Code § 1548.1 (2006)) (italics added). Due to his failure to appear at his\ncourt hearing in Maryland and his current residence in California, Haig falls, into the category of persons whose\narrest and delivery to the state in which the crime was committed is legally mandated. It could be argued that\nCalifornia law enforcement is unlikely to prioritize finding those charged with minor offenses in another state;\nhowever, this court must assume that a state's executive will follow the law rather than speculate about what\npriorities a governor will set for law enforcement. Under California law, Haig's arrest and return to Maryland is\nrequired and may happen at any moment. Therefore, Haig may be said to live in apprehension of a real and\n[24]\nimmediate threat of being returned to Maryland and re-admitted to CBIC.  Once at CBIC, it is alleged that\nHaig, as a male arrestee, will be subject to a full strip search in a non-private situation pursuant to CBIC's\npolicies. Accepting the plaintiffs' allegations as true, as I must for the purposes of a 12(b)(6) motion, it follows that\nHaig faces a real and immediate threat of substantial and irreparable harm to his Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights. This case is thus distinguishable from Lyons, in which the plaintiff failed to establish a\nsufficient likelihood either of re-arrest or of being subject to the alleged unconstitutional behavior (choke hold)\nwere he to be re-arrested. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105-06, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (explaining that plaintiff failed to allege\n\"that he would have another encounter with the police . . . [and] to make the incredible assertion . . . that all police\nofficers in Los Angeles always choke any citizen with whom they happen to have an encounter . .\") (italics in\noriginal). Haig has sufficiently alleged both that he is substantially likely to have another experience at CBIC and\nthat this will involve the alleged constitutional violations, therefore he has standing to sue for equitable relief on at\n[25]\nleast some of the plaintiffs' claims.\n552 *552 As to Haig, because the likelihood of his future admission to CBIC is based on an outstanding warrant, he\nwould not be subject to over detention under the plaintiffs' theories because those claims relate to people\narrested without warrants who are over detained prior to presentment. Furthermore, Haig has not alleged that he\nwas subject to an underwear strip search in the past, and the plaintiffs allege that the general CBIC policy is to\nsubject males to a full strip search. (3d Am. Compl. ¶ 154.) While no named plaintiffs thus clearly have standing\nto bring suit for equitable relief with respect to the over detention or underwear strip search claims, I reserve for\nfuture consideration the possibility that if classes are certified in this case, there might be additional arguments,\ndiscussed above, for finding standing with respect to all claims.\nCity Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\nThe City defendants do not dispute that they are subject to suit under § 1983. See Monell v. Dept. Soc. Serv.,\n436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); Chin v. City of Baltimore, 241 F.Supp.2d 546, 548\n(D.Md.2003) (Blake, J.) (holding that the BPD may be sued under § 1983). Rather, they claim that the plaintiffs\nseek to hold them responsible for circumstances they do not and cannot control 00 namely, the policies and\n97\npractices at CBIC. (Mem. Supp. City Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 12.) This interpretation of the plaintiffs' arguments,\nhowever, is inaccurate. The plaintiffs do not seek to impose liability on the City defendants for CBIC's actions, but\nfor the City and the BPD's own actions: taking arrestees to CBIC despite having knowledge of the allegedly\nunconstitutional, strip searches and over detentions at CBIC. The plaintiffs thus seek to bring claims against the\nCity defendants under the theory of \"entrustment liability\", as discussed below.\n\"Entrustment Liability \"\nAn \"entrustment liability\" approach has been neither adopted nor rejected in the Fourth Circuit. It has been\naccepted in other circuits, although not always labeled as such. See Warren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36,\n39 (D.C.Cir.2004) (holding that allegations that District had or should have had knowledge of alleged\nconstitutional violations suffered while plaintiff was incarcerated in a private prison operated pursuant to a\ncontract with the District were sufficient to state a claim); Baker v. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306-07\n\n(D.C.Cir.2003) (holding that allegations of deliberate indifference on the part of the municipality which was\nresponsible for sentencing a prisoner toward known constitutional violations at another state's facility which was\ndetaining the prisoner were sufficient to survive 12(b)(6) motion); Young v. City of Little Rock, 249 F.3d 730, 736\n(8th Cir.2001) (\"Strip searching of prisoners is routine procedure, and the jury could reasonably infer that the City\n553 knew that a person entering the jail . . . *553 would be strip searched . . . in these circumstances, it is far from\nunfair to attribute to the City the policies routinely used by the County jail in the housing and processing of City\nprisoners.\"). While the formulations differ slightly, the underlying premise is that \"a municipal body that maintains\n[26]\na policy of entrusting its arrestees to a jail  with knowledge of the unconstitutional treatment those persons will\nface upon their confinement there can be liable under § 1983.\" Powell v. Barrett, 376 F.Supp.2d 1340, 1355\n[27]\n(N.D.Ga. 2005).  Liability thus requires that the accused municipality have both a policy of entrustment and\nknowledge of constitutional violations at the detaining entity. Id. at 1355.\nEven assuming the theory of \"entrustment liability\" would be recognized in the Fourth Circuit, however, the\nplaintiffs here are unable to state claims under it upon which relief could be granted. Implicit in the policy\ncomponent required to impose liability is that the entrusting entity has formulated the policy; that is, that it had a\nchoice over whether to follow the challenged course of action. See Powell v. Barrett, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 685,\n*37-38 (N.D.Ga.2005) (explaining that the entrusting entity cannot be liable \"for constitutional injuries suffered by\na detainee unless it had the authority to choose whether to entrust such a person to the facility.\") (unpublished)\n(internal citations omitted). The City defendants persuasively argue that they have no choice because they are\nnot legally permitted to maintain their own facility; therefore it would be unfair to hold them liable for using the\nfacility they are required to use by state law. (Mem. Supp. City Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 9; City Defs.' Reply Mem.\nSupp. Mot. Dismiss at 4-5.) See also Md.Code Ann., Corr. Servs. §§ 5-102, 201, 401, 404 (2006). The steps\nwhich the plaintiffs contend the City defendants could have taken to prevent violations of arrestees' constitutional\nrights do not suggest the existence of choice sufficient to give rise to liability. For instance, the plaintiffs argue that\nthe City defendants could have filed a lawsuit against CBIC. (Pls.' Opp'n Mot. Dismiss at 35.) In fact, the City\nattempted to intervene as a plaintiff in the state court suit regarding over detentions, but was denied leave to do\nso. (Mem. Supp. City Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 12.) This illustrates the flaw with the argument that the ability to file a\nlawsuit shows the existence of meaningful control: the court ultimately decides the outcome of the issues in a\nsuit, thus filing a suit is, on some level, an admission that external help is needed to effectuate the desired\nresults.\nThe plaintiffs' also argue that there is a category of arrestees whose violations could have been processed with\ncitations and thus, in arresting them, the City defendants essentially chose to take them to CBIC. Opp'n Mot.\nDismiss at 42-43.) The complaint, however, does not identify such a group. Instead it categorizes the plaintiffs\n554 based on the types of constitutional violations they allegedly suffered *554 (e.g., equal protection strip search\nclass), and would make the City defendants liable for all persons in a given category of violations, even if the\nunderlying arrest was clearly justified. (See City Defs.' Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss at 6.) There may be a\ngroup for which citations could or should have been used; however, even if the plaintiffs had pled this, there\nwould be significant concerns for the court in attempting to define the membership in this group, as doing so\nwould likely necessitate more judicial assessment of discretionary law enforcement priorities and procedures than\nwould be warranted. Therefore, the potential existence of such a group fails to supply the element of choice\nnecessary to give rise to liability under the \"entrustment liability\" theory.\nBecause the court finds that the unique facts of this case render the \"entrustment liability\" theory inapplicable,\nthere is no need to consider arguments about its validity generally under Fourth Circuit law.\nA separate order follows.\nORDER\nFor the reasons stated in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby ORDERED that:\n1. The State defendants' motion to dismiss (docket entry no. 61) is Denied in part and Granted in part;\n\n2. The State defendants' motion in the alternative for summary judgment (docket no. 61) is Denied without\nprejudice;\n3. The City defendants' motion to dismiss (docket entry no. 58) is Granted; and\n4. The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Police Department are dismissed from this\ncase.\n[1] The plaintiffs include other police agencies under the City's control, such as the Baltimore City Housing Police,\nin this suit. (3d Am.Compl. ¶ 97.)\n[2] The current warden, Mitchell Franks, is sued in his individual and official capacities, (3d Am.Compl. ¶ 86),\nexcept with respect to the over detention claims, for which he is sued in his official capacity only (Pls.' Opp'n\nState Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 3d Am. Compl. at 2, n. 1). Former wardens Susan Murphy and William Jednorski are\nsued in their individual capacities. (Id. at ¶¶ 87-88.)\n[3] CBIC is an agency of the Maryland Division of Pretrial Detention and Services. (3d Am. Compl. ¶ 99.)\n[4] The third amended complaint inadvertently mischaracterized this offense as an open alcohol container. (Pls.'\nOpp'n State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 3d Am. Compl. at 6 n. 4.)\n[5] The plaintiffs define \"strip search\" or \"full strip search\" as \"the removal, pulling down, or rearrangement of\nclothing for the visual inspection of an arrested person's genital and/or anal areas, which may also include\nrequiring the person to squat and cough, in the presence of one or more guards.\" (3d Am.Compl. ¶ 8.)\n[6] Represented by named plaintiffs West, Jones, Saunders, Haig, and Washington.\n[7] Represented by named plaintiffs West, Jones, Saunders, Haig, and Washington.\n[8] Represented by named plaintiffs West, Jones, Saunders, Haig, and Washington.\n[9] The plaintiffs define \"underwear strip search\" as \"a strip search to the person's underwear, without removing\nor rearranging the underwear for visual inspection of bare skin thereunder.\" (3d Am.Compl. ¶ 8.)\n[10] Represented by named plaintiff Adams.\n[11] Represented by named plaintiffs Bowie, Colyns, Saunders, Washington, Haig, and Adams. A recent suit in\nstate court, Rodney, et al. v. Murphy, case no. 24-C-05-004405, also challenged over detention practices, which\nseem to have improved as a result.\n[12] Count 9 is just against Warden Murphy in her individual capacity.\n[13] Note that these encompass both the allegations of the equal protection class and the underwear strip search\nclass, named as such by the plaintiffs to avoid confusion. (3d Am. Compl. at 8, n. 1.)\n[14] The wardens also argue for summary judgment on these claims; however, it would be premature to consider\nsummary judgment before the plaintiffs have had the opportunity to contest the affidavits upon which the wardens\nbase their arguments for the strip search policy's constitutionality. (See State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 3d Am. Compl.\nat 10.)\n[15] From here on, all references to any motion, opposition, or reply will be assumed to be referring to those\naddressing the third amended complaint unless otherwise indicated.\n[16] The plaintiffs contend that their alleged facts could make out claims under additional theories, such as\n\"failure to train\" or bystander liability. (Pls.' Opp'n State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 18-19.) Given that the Wardens\nfocus their argument on supervisory liability and that the plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim under that\ntheory, it is not necessary to analyze other potential theories at this time.\n\n[17] Causation can also be established directly, such as a policy mandating employees to carry out\nunconstitutional actions against the plaintiff. Shaw, 13 F.3d at 799 (internal citations omitted). Depending on what\nis established about CBIC's official policy on strip searching, this avenue of proof might also be available to the\nplaintiffs.\n[18] To be clear, I am not relying on Johnson itself as persuasive authority because it is unpublished and in any\nevent had not been handed down when the alleged violations at CBIC occurred; rather, I am adopting the\nrationale of the Johnson court, which relies on Supreme Court cases (Bell and U.S. v. Virginia) that were decided\nwell before 2003.\n[19] This case is analyzed under the Fifth Amendment because it alleges Equal Protection claims against the\nfederal government rather than a state; however, this does not change the underlying principles.\n[20] That the reported cases involve strip searches of females rather than males does not affect the underlying\nEqual Protection analysis related to gender-based governmental action.\n[21] These are Counts 1 (suspicionless strip search), 2 (non-private strip search), 3 (equal protection strip\nsearch), and 11 (equal protection underwear strip search). (Pls.' Opp'n State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 25.)\n[22] Dismissal is without prejudice to any subsequent plaintiff's attempt to bring such a claim against Warden\nFranks in his individual capacity.\n[23] Note that the Seventh Circuit apparently rejected this approach in Robinson v. City of Chicago, 868 F.2d 959,\n967-68 (7th Cir.1989), although it did not specifically overrule Tully.\n[24] The plaintiffs do not mention which court issued the bench warrant; however, as Haig was arrested in\nBaltimore City, it would follow that it was a court of Baltimore City and that Haig would therefore be taken to\nCBIC, since that is where Baltimore City arrestees are taken. (3d Am.Compl. ¶¶ 69, 98, 106.)\n[25] The Wardens urge the court to apply the \"fugitive disentitlement doctrine\" and deny Haig standing. (State\nDefs.' Reply Pls.' Opp'n Mot. Dismiss at 2-3.) This discretionary, equitable measure reflects several policy\nconsiderations. See Jaffe v. Accredited Surety & Casualty Co., 294 F.3d 584, 595-96 (4th Cir.2002). \"These\ninclude (1) a party's fugitive status can render a judgment `impossible to enforce'; (2) the inequity of allowing a\nfugitive to `call upon the resources of the Court for determination of his claims,' and (3) the need to `discourage[ ]\nthe felony of escape and encourage[ voluntary surrenders.'\" Id. at 596 (internal citations omitted). None of the\nunderlying policies strongly points towards application of this doctrine here. There would be no difficulty with\nenforcing a judgment; constitutional violations should be redressed whether perpetrated against fugitives or\nothers; and while failure to show up for court and fleeing the state is criminal behavior, having standing to obtain\ninjunctive relief for governmental actions connected to arrests, booking, and processing virtually necessitates\nhaving been arrested and being likely to be re-arrested, making fugitives likely, if not necessary, plaintiffs. Thus\nthe defendants' argument is essentially that Haig is not entitled to standing because he is a fugitive, which if\naccepted would mandate the application of this doctrine to all fugitives rather than maintaining its discretionary\nnature.\n[26] Although CBIC is not technically a jail, but a booking and processing site, this distinction does not undermine\nthe theory.\n[27] Note that another case involving the \"entrustment liability\" theory, Ford, 154 F.Supp.2d at 148-49, did not\nrequire knowledge on the part of the entrusting authority but rather placed on the city \"an affirmative obligation\n. . . to ensure that the policy of the Jail officials did not lead to widespread violation of BPD [Boston Police\nDepartment] arrestees' constitutional rights.\" As the plain tiffs here plead that the City defendants had actual\nknowledge, and the claim will be dismissed for other reasons, whether an \"entrustment liability\" theory may be\npursued absent knowledge by the defendant(s) does not need to be addressed.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
