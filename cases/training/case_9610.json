    "summary": "<p>On March 19, 2004, two plaintiffs represented by private attorneys from Albany, New York, filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, alleging that the Schoharie County Sheriff's Department (\"SCSD\") had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all individuals who entered the Schoharie County Jail, including those charged with misdemeanors or held on civil matters, regardless of the crime for which they were charged and without reasonable suspicion to believe that the individuals were concealing weapons or contraband.  </p><p>The named plaintiffs included an Albany County Jail corrections officer arrested for back child support and another man charged with DWI.  They alleged that, pursuant to the Sheriff's policy, they were forced to strip naked and subjected to visual inspections in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs also alleged the constitutional violation stemmed from the Sheriff's deliberate indifference to constitutional rights by not adequately training individual officers he employed. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary and punitive damages and class certification for the thousands of individuals that suffered the same alleged indignities.  The defendants, the County and the Sheriff, answered by generally denying all allegations.</p><p>The case was assigned to District Judge Lawrence E. Kahn, who referred the case to Magistrate Judge David Homer to oversee scheduling and case discovery.  A scheduling order was entered, which directed the parties to complete discovery by June 1, 2005.  Discovery ensued.  On the last day of discovery, the County moved to amend its answer to assert an affirmative defense that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) (PLRA).  The District Court (Magistrate Judge Homer) denied the County's request to answer, finding that the PLRA did not apply to the case, as neither plaintiff was incarcerated at the time the case was filed.  Kelsey v. County of Schoharie, 2005 WL 1972557 (N.D. N.Y. Aug 05, 2005) (NO. 04-CV-299).</p><p>The plaintiffs moved for class certification, which the defendants opposed. Defendants, in turn, moved for summary judgment.  Judge Kahn denied defendants' motion for summary judgment and certified the case as a class action.  The class was defined as:</p><p>All persons in the United States who have been, or will be, placed into the custody of the Schoharie County Jail after being charged with \"misdemeanors, violations, or held on civil matters\" and were, or will be, strip searched upon their entry into the Schoharie County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Schoharie County Sheriff's Department and the County of Schoharie. The class period commences on March 19, 2001, and extends to the date on which the Schoharie County Sheriff's Department and/or the County of Schoharie are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion.  Kelsey v. County of Schoharie, 2007 WL 603406 (N.D. N.Y. Feb 21, 2007).  </p><p>Judge Kahn refused to certify his order for immediate appeal by defendants. On December 19, 2007, the Court (Judge Kahn) held a pre-trial conference where parties discussed the settlement but the matter did not settle and a trial date was set for June 16, 2008. During the pre-trial conference, the parties also discussed whether the case would be tried before a jury or Judge Kahn. On March 27, 2008, plaintiffs submitted a letter motion requesting waiver of the previously requested jury trial, followed by defendant's letter brief on April 3, 2008, objecting to plaintiffs' requests to waive a jury trial because withdrawing a jury trial after already submitting a request requires consent of both parties. On April 14, 2008, the Court (Judge Kahn) ordered the case to go forward as a jury trial and adjourned the trial date to September 16, 2008.  Thereafter, the jury trial was adjourned three times, notably due to defendants awaiting the Court of Appeals decision on the issue of qualified immunity for two individual defendants. </p><p>On October 14, 2009, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the the District Court’s previous decision and order that denied the defendants’ motion for summary judgment and defense of qualified immunity (with Judge Sotomayor dissenting). The Second Circuit found that the incidental observation of the body of an arrestee during required clothing exchange, as described by the plaintiffs, was not an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. It also decided that plaintiffs did not identify any constitutional violation on the parts of individual defendants. As a result, the Second Circuit remanded the case back with instructions to dismiss the action (with Judge Sotomayor dissenting). </p><p>Following the Second Circuit’s decision, on October 16, 2009, the District Court (Judge Kahn) granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment that was previously filed in 2005, entered judgment in favor of the defendants and dismissed the case in its entirety. The court also granted the defendants’ application for attorneys fees and ordered the plaintiffs to pay that fee of $1,662.60. Later on February 23, 2010, the Court ordered the plaintiffs to pay the total bill of costs, including the previously ordered attorneys fees, that totaled $3,487.20. </p><p>The case is now closed. </p>",

Discussion \nUnited States District Court, \nN.D. New York.  On June 1, 2005, the County moved for leave to file and \nserve an amended answer to add an affirmative defense \nJohn KELSEY and Timothy Wright, Plaintiffs, \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), \nv. \nPub.L.  No.  104-134,  -803(d),  110  Stat.  1321-66,  -71 \nCOUNTY OF SCHOHARIE; John S. Bates, Jr,; \n(1996).  Under  the  PLRA  provision  in  42  U.S.C.  § \nand Jim Hazzard, Defendants. \n1997e(e), “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a \nprisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional \nNo. 04-CV-299. | Aug. 5, 2005. \nfacility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in \ncustody without a prior showing of physical injury.” The \nAttorneys and Law Firms  County now seeks to add the affirmative defense that \nplaintiffs are limited to nominal damages by § 1997e(e) \nBeranbaum, Menken, Ben-Asher & Bierman, New York,  because they cannot prove any physical injury. \nNew York, for Plaintiffs, Bruce E. Menken, Jason, J.    \nRozger, of counsel.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) requires that on a motion for leave to \namend a pleading, leave be “freely given when justice so \nElmer  Robert  Keach,  Amsterdam,  New  York,  for  requires.” This “ ‘facilitate[s] a decision on the merits” ’ \nPlaintiffs.  and identifies the material issues of the case. Torres v. \nOakland  Scavenger  Co.,  487  U.S.  312,  320  (1988) \nGirvin  &  Ferlazzo,  P.C.,  Albany,  New  York,  for  (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). \nDefendants, Gregg T. Johnson, Jacinda H. Conboy, of  Courts have broad discretion to grant a party leave to \ncounsel.  amend its pleadings, Local 802, Associated Musicians of \nGreater N.Y. v. Parker Meridien Hotel, 145 F.3d 85, 89 \nOpinion \n(2d Cir.1998). Amending a pleading is futile where the \n \nproposed amendment does not cure the deficiencies in the \noriginal pleading, Acito v. Imcera Group, Inc., 47 F.3d 47, \n55  (2d  Cir.1995),  or  would  not  survive  a  motion  to \nMEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER \ndismiss. Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 941 F.2d 119, \n123 (2d Cir.1991). Therefore, to determine whether the \nHOMER, Magistrate J.  proposed amendment is futile, a court must apply “the \nsame analysis as that applied on a motion to dismiss” \n*1 Presently pending is the motion of defendants County  under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Stetz v. Reeher Enterprises, \nof  Schoharie,  John  S.  Bates,  Jr.,  and  Jim  Hazzard  Inc., 70 F.Supp.2d 119, 121 (N.D.N.Y.1999) (McAvoy, \n(collectively referred to herein as the “County”) for leave  C.J.). Accordingly, the facts alleged by the County here \nto  file  an  amended  answer.  Docket  No.  37.  Plaintiffs  are  treated  as  true  and  are  viewed  in  the  light  most \noppose the motion. Docket No. 38. For the reasons which  favorable to the County. See id. \nfollow, the County’s motion is denied.    \n   The issue presented here is whether § 1997e(e) applies \n  where plaintiffs were no longer incarcerated when the \naction was commenced. The plain language of § 1997e(e), \nthe declared purpose of the PLRA, and case law support \nI.

There is no dispute here that the named \nThe County answered and a scheduling order was entered \nplaintiffs  and  potential  class  members  were  not \npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 16 requiring that pleadings be \nincarcerated when the action was commenced. \namended  by  November  1,  2004  and  discovery  be \n  \ncompleted by July 1, 2005. Docket Nos. 4, 12, 33. \n*2 This interpretation of that language is supported by the \n  \npurpose  of  the  PLRA,  which  was  “to  curtail  what \n  1 \n \n\nKelsey v. County of Schoharie, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2005)   \n \nCongress perceived to be inmate abuses of the judicial  *3  Section  1997e(e)  ...  is  a \nprocess.”  Ortiz  v.

The Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s \nfrom prison Kerr avoided § 1997e(e).”).  holding in an unpublished opinion “for substantially the \n   reasons  stated  in  the  district  court’s  thorough  and \nWith two exceptions discussed below, district courts have  well-reasoned opinion.” 56 Fed.Appx. 43; see also Lipton \nheld the same.

However, if Congress intended § \ntheir  claims.”);  Lee  v.

PLRA, and such Congressional determination and intent \n   are not unreasonable. \nDefendants rely on Cox v. Malone, 199 F.Supp.2d 135    \n(S.D.N.Y.2002), aff’d, 56 Fed.Appx. 43 (2d Cir.2003).  The Cox decision, of course, does not constitute binding \nThere, a former state prisoner sued state officials alleging  precedent  for  this  Court.  Were  it  simply  a  matter  of \nthe excessive use of force during a search in violation of  analyzing the Cox decision in light of the Kerr line of \n42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  Defendants  moved  for  summary  cases addressing the scope of § 1997e(e), the Kerr line of \njudgment  on  the  ground,  inter  alia,  that  the  physical  cases holding that the plain meaning of the language in § \ninjury alleged by plaintiff was de minimis and, therefore,  1997e(e) limits its applicability to prisoners incarcerated \nfailed  to  satisfy  the  physical  injury  requirement  of  §  at the time an action is commenced is most persuasive. \n1997e(e). The district court granted the motion, holding  The Second Circuit’s affirmance described that decision \nthat § 1997e(e) applied to plaintiff even though he had  as  “thorough  and  well-reasoned.”  That  affirmance, \nbeen  released  from  custody  before  commencing  the  however, was unpublished and by Second Circuit rule, \naction. The court reasoned that \n  2 \n \n\nKelsey v. County of Schoharie, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2005)   \n \nmay not be cited as authority outside the Cox litigation.  answer would be futile. Therefore, the County’s motion to \nSee 2d Cir. R. 0.23. Thus, the question becomes whether  file and serve an amended answer is denied.1 \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  unpublished  affirmance  of  Cox    \nshould lead a court in these circumstances to follow Cox.   \n  \nFor at least two reasons, it does not. First, Second Circuit \nIII. Conclusion \nRule  0.23,  restated  on  the  Cox  affirmance,  explicitly \nlimits the precedential value of the affirmance to the Cox \n*4 For the reasons stated above, it is hereby \ncase itself and bars its use in this and other cases. That \n  \nrule  should  be  followed  unless  and  until  the  Second \nORDERED that the County’s motion to file and serve an \nCircuit directs otherwise. Second, neither Cox nor the \namended answer (Docket No. 37) is DENIED. \nSecond Circuit have directly considered or addressed the \n  \nKerr  line  of  cases  and  their  compelling  rationale. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nAccordingly,  for  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the \n  \nrationale of the Kerr line of cases is adopted. Because \n\t\r  \nplaintiffs were not incarcerated at the time this action was \ncommenced, § 1997e(e) is inapplicable and the defense \nwhich the County seeks to add in its proposed amended \n Footnotes \n \n1  Plaintiffs also oppose the County’s motion on the ground that it is untimely. However, substantially for the reasons set forth in the \nCounty’s Memorandum of Law (Docket No. 37) at pages 2-6, that contention, must be rejected. \n \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  3 \n ",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nJOHN KELSEY and TIMOTHY WRIGHT,\nPlaintiffs,\n-against- 1:04-CV-299\n(LEK/DRH)\nCOUNTY OF SCHOHARIE; JOHN S.\nBATES, JR.; and JIM HAZZARD,\nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER1\nI.  Background\nPlaintiffs John Kelsey and Timothy Wright (“Plaintiffs”) filed this lawsuit on behalf of\n“themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors,\nviolations, or held on civil matters and were strip searched upon their entry into the Schoharie\nCounty Jail.”  Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) at 3-4.  Plaintiffs are claiming violations of their\nconstitutional rights and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\nat the hands of the Defendants.2  Id. at 1, 7.  The case was assigned to the undersigned, and to the\nHonorable David R. Homer, United States Magistrate Judge, for pre-trial matters.\nOn July 27, 2004, Magistrate Judge Homer issued a Uniform Pretrial Scheduling Order,\nwhich was amended March 4, 2005, setting, inter alia, the deadline for applications for amendments\n1 For printed publication in the Federal Reporter.\n2 But, note that Plaintiffs have stated that they are not seeking punitive damages from the\nCounty of Schoharie.  Mem. of Law in Opp. to Defts’ Motion for Leave to Amend Answer (“Plntfs’\nMem. in Opp.”) (Dkt. No. 38) at 3 (citing Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) at 13).\n1\n\nof pleadings at November 1, 2004, and the deadline for completion of discovery at July 1, 2005. \nDkt. Nos. 12 & 33.  On June 1, 2005, Defendants moved before Judge Homer for leave to file an\nAmended Answer, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, to set forth an Eighth\nAffirmative Defense at paragraph 39 of said pleading.  Dkt. No. 37.  The Amended Answer would\nread, at the relevant paragraph 39: “Plaintiffs’ claim for compensatory damages is barred by the\nPrisoner [sic] Litigation Reform Act (“PRLA”) [sic], 42 USC §1997 et. seq.”  Proposed Amended\nAnswer (Dkt. No. 37) at 8.  Defendants also moved for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 11, requesting attorneys fees and costs associated with the motion to amend their\nAnswer.3  Dkt. No. 37.  Plaintiffs opposed Defendants’ motion to amend the Answer.  Plntfs’ Mem.\nin Opp. (Dkt. No. 38).\nOn August 5, 2005, Judge Homer issued a Memorandum-Decision and Order, pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 636(b), Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72, and Local Rules 72.1 & 72.2 of the Northern\nDistrict of New York, in which he denied Defendants’ Motion.  Decision & Order (Dkt. No. 40). \nJudge Homer determined, among other things, that § 1997e(e) is inapplicable to this case, and\ntherefore the proposed amendment containing the affirmative defense would be futile.\nDefendants have objected to Judge Homer’s Decision and Order pursuant to Local Rule\n72.1(b) (Dkt. No. 41), and Plaintiffs have submitted papers in opposition to Defendants’ objections\n(Dkt. No. 59).  The matter having been fully briefed, this Court now decides the appeal.  For the\n3 Although Defendants made a motion for Rule 11 sanctions in their Motion to Amend (Dkt.\nNo. 37), and Plaintiffs addressed the issue in their opposition papers (Dkt. No. 38), Judge Homer\ndid not address the Rule 11 sanctions issue in his Memorandum-Decision and Order (Dkt. No. 40).\nAlthough Plaintiffs mention that Judge Homer denied Defendants’ Rule 11 sanctions motion sub\nsilentio (Dkt. No. 59 at 1 n.1), Defendants do not raise an objection.  Therefore, this Court will not\naddress the issue of Rule 11 sanctions on this appeal.\n2\n\nfollowing reasons, Defendants’ objections are overruled.  Judge Homer’s Memorandum-Decision\nand Order is affirmed in its entirety.  Defendants will not be permitted to amend their Answer.\nII.  Discussion\nA.  Standards of Law\nJudge Homer’s Memorandum-Decision and Order concerned a non-dispositive, pre-trial\nmotion, and as such this Court reviews the magistrate judge’s findings to determine if they are\nclearly erroneous or contrary to law.  28 U.S.C. § 636(b); FED. R. CIV. P. 72(a); Cauley v. Ingram\nMicro, Inc., 216 F.R.D. 245 (W.D.N.Y. 2003); World Wrestling Fed’n Entm’t, Inc. v. William\nMorris Agency, Inc., 204 F.R.D. 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“An order is ‘clearly erroneous’ only when\n‘“the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been committed.”’...An order is ‘contrary to law’ when it ‘fails to apply or misapplies\nrelevant statutes, case law or rules of procedure.’”) (citations omitted); Precisionflow Tech., Inc. v.\nCVD Equip. Corp., 140 F. Supp. 2d 195, 197-198 (N.D.N.Y. 2001) (Mordue, D.J.; Homer, M.J.)\n(“this Court must review [the Magistrate Judge’s] Memorandum-Decision and Order under the\n‘clearly erroneous or contrary to law’ standard of review....This standard affords magistrate judges\nbroad discretion in resolving non-dispositive disputes, thus reversal is appropriate only if the\ndiscretion is abused.”) (citing, inter alia, Thomas E. Hoar Inc. v. Sara Lee Corp., 900 F.2d 522, 525\n(2d Cir. 1990)).\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 - Amended and Supplemental Pleadings - the\nSecond Circuit has stated that the Rule “provides that ‘a party may amend the party’s pleading...by\nleave of court...and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.’  A district court has broad\n3\n\ndiscretion to decide whether to grant leave to amend, a decision that we review for an abuse of\ndiscretion....Furthermore, where amendment would be futile, denial of leave to amend is proper.”  In\nre Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., No. 03-7641, 2005 WL 2864654, at *28 (2d Cir. Nov. 2,\n2005) (citing, inter alia, Van Buskirk v. N.Y. Times Co., 325 F.3d 87, 91-92 (2d Cir. 2003)).  In\naddition, “Rule 15(a) declares that leave to amend ‘shall be freely given when justice so requires’;\nthis mandate is to be heeded....In the absence of any apparent or declared reason--such as undue\ndelay, bad faith...on the part of the movant,...futility of amendment, etc.--the leave sought should, as\nthe rules require, be ‘freely given.’  Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is\nwithin the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any\njustifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that\ndiscretion”.  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181-182 (1962).  See also Local 802, Assoc. Musicians\nof Greater New York v. Parker Meridien Hotel, 145 F.3d 85, 89 (2d Cir. 1998).  Thus, both the\nmagistrate judge and the undersigned have broad discretion to grant or deny a motion to amend the\npleadings.\nSeparately, the relevant portion of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) states as\nfollows: “(e) Limitation on recovery[.]  No Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner\nconfined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered\nwhile in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.”  PLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e)\n(emphasis added).  And, the term “prisoner” has been defined as: “any person incarcerated or\ndetained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for,\nviolations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or \n4\n\ndiversionary program.”  PLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(h).  See also Greig v. Goord, 169 F.3d 165, 166\n(2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam).\nB.  Amendment of the Pleadings\nFirst, it should be noted that the motion to amend the pleadings was not made until June 1,\n2005 - a full seven months after the November 1, 2004, deadline set by the Court in the Scheduling\nOrder.  However, Judge Homer rejected Plaintiffs’ untimeliness arguments for the reasons presented\nby the Defendants in Defendants’ Memorandum of Law (Dkt. No. 37) at pages 2-6.  Therefore, that\nissue aside, Judge Homer evaluated the merits of the motion to amend.  At issue is the futility of the\nproposed amendment, and the applicability, or lack thereof, of § 1997e(e) of the PLRA to this case.\nThe PLRA was passed by Congress, with the purpose of “curtail[ing] what Congress\nperceived to be inmate abuses of the judicial process.”  Ortiz v. McBride, 380 F.3d 649, 658 (2d\nCir. 2004) (with citations); Greig, 169 F.3d at 167.  As Judge Homer observed, if a litigant is no\nlonger incarcerated at the time the action is brought, they do not fall within the category of litigant\nwith which Congress was concerned - incarcerated plaintiffs who bring civil actions for recreation. \nAs support for finding § 1997e(e) inapplicable to the case at bar, Judge Homer cites case law from\naround the country that has found § 1997e(e) to apply only to those litigants who are still\nincarcerated when filing their claims.  See, inter alia, Harris v. Garner, 216 F.3d 970 (11th Cir.\n2000) (en banc); Kerr v. Puckett, 138 F.3d 321 (7th Cir. 1998) (Easterbrook, J.) (plaintiff avoided\napplication of § 1997e(e) by waiting until after release to file suit; there is no “wiggle room”, and\n“prisoner” and “ex-prisoner” are not interchangeable); Smith v. Franklin County, 227 F. Supp. 2d\n667 (E.D. Ky. 2002); Doan v. Watson, 168 F. Supp. 2d 932 (S.D. Ind. 2001); Lee v. State of New\n5\n\nYork Dep’t of Correctional Servs., No. 97 Civ. 7112(DAB), 1999 WL 673339 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30,\n1999).  In fact, both the Second and Eighth Circuits have expressly found that the PLRA does not\napply to cases where a plaintiff is no longer incarcerated or detained.  See Greig, 169 F.3d at 167\n(addressing exhaustion requirement of § 1997e(a), which uses language like that of § 1997e(e) -\n“litigants--like Greig--who file prison condition actions after release from confinement are no longer\n‘prisoners’ for purposes of § 1997e(a) and, therefore, need not satisfy the exhaustion requirements\nof this provision.”); Doe By and Through Doe v. Washington County, 150 F.3d 920, 924 (8th Cir.\n1998) (“When he filed this complaint, [Plaintiff/Appellee] was neither incarcerated nor detained in\nany jail, prison, or correctional facility.  The PLRA unambiguously applies to only those suits filed\nby prisoners.  [Plaintiff/Appellee] was not a prisoner, and the PLRA therefore does not apply to his\ncase....Congress...fully intended to distinguish between those who are ‘prisoners’ when they decide\nwhether to file a complaint and those who are not.”).  If a litigant, by a fortuitous turn of events, is\nreleased from jail or prison prior to commencing an action, § 1997e(e) does not apply to the claims.\nAdditionally, decisions of other districts, like the Southern District of New York (Cox v.\nMalone, 199 F. Supp. 2d 135 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), and Lipton v. County of Orange, 315 F. Supp. 2d\n434 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)), or split decisions of other districts, like the Southern District of Indiana\n(compare Doan v. Watson, 168 F. Supp. 2d 932 (S.D. Ind. 2001), with Zehner v. Trigg, 952 F.\nSupp. 1318 (S.D. Ind. 1997)) are not binding upon a judge in the Northern District of New York. \nThe District Court in Cox advanced the following reasoning:\nSection 1997e(a) is a procedural requirement requiring prisoners to fully exhaust their\nclaims within the prison system before bringing a federal action.  It makes no sense to apply\nthis procedural requirement to former inmates who can no longer avail themselves of prison\ngrievance procedures.  Section 1997e(e), on the other hand, is a substantive limitation on the\ntype of actions that can be brought by prisoners.  Its purpose is to weed out frivolous claims\n6\n\nwhere only emotional injuries are alleged.  This purpose is accomplished whether section\n1997e(e) is applied to suits brought by inmates incarcerated at the time of filing or by former\ninmates incarcerated at the time of the alleged injury but subsequently released.  The fortuity\nof release on parole does not affect the kind of damages that must be alleged in order to\nsurvive the gate-keeping function of section 1997e(e).  Because plaintiff’s suit alleges only\nemotional injuries, it is barred by the PLRA irrespective of his status as a parolee at the time\nof filing.\nCox, 199 F. Supp. 2d at 140 (emphasis by the Court).  However, when the same language is used in\ndifferent sections of the same statute, there can be a presumption that the language has the same\nmeaning.\nUndoubtedly, there is a natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of\nthe same act are intended to have the same meaning....But the presumption is not rigid and\nreadily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used\nas reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act\nwith different intent.  Where the subject-matter to which the words refer is not the same in\nthe several places where they are used, or the conditions are different, or the scope of the\nlegislative power exercised in one case is broader than that exercised in another, the meaning\nwell may vary to meet the purposes of the law, to be arrived at by a consideration of the\nlanguage in which those purposes are expressed, and of the circumstances under which the\nlanguage was employed.\nAtl. Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, 286 U.S. 427, 433 (1932) (Sutherland, J.) (citations\nomitted).  Furthermore, aside from the PLRA itself not seeming to draw distinctions between the\nlanguage concerning “prisoner[s] confined” in its various sections - as Plaintiffs rightly argue (see\nDkt. No. 59 at 9) - the language of the statute appears to be clear, as has been addressed by other\ncourts cited by the parties and Judge Homer.  If the language of a statute is unambiguous, courts\ngenerally should not look beyond that language to interpret the application of the provisions.  See\nConnecticut Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992) (Thomas, J.) (“In any event,\ncanons of construction are no more than rules of thumb that help courts determine the meaning of\nlegislation, and in interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one, cardinal canon before\n7\n\nall others.  We have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a\nstatute what it means and means in a statute what it says there....When the words of a statute are\nunambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: ‘judicial inquiry is complete.’”) (citations\nomitted).  The exceptions enumerated by the Atlantic Cleaners Court, supra, are not, in this Court’s\nopinion, present in the case at bar.\nIn light of the similarity of the statutory language of § 1997e(a) and § 1997e(e) and the\ncongressional authority, in light of the statutory language and Congressional intent addressed by the\nmany other courts that have decided this issue, and in the face of opposing case law from around the\ncountry, this Court rejects the reasoning presented by Cox.  And, the decision of the Second Circuit\nin Cox v. Malone, 56 Fed. Appx. 43, 2003 WL 366724 (2d Cir. 2003), is also not binding precedent\nupon a judge in this District since the following is explicitly printed at the top of the opinion: “THIS\nSUMMARY ORDER WILL NOT BE PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REPORTER AND MAY\nNOT BE CITED AS PRECEDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO THIS OR ANY OTHER COURT....” . \nCox, 56 Fed. Appx. 43, 2003 WL 366724.  Although those decisions are persuasive, so is the wealth\nof case law from the rest of the nation, discussed by the parties and Judge Homer, finding that §\n1997e(e) does not act to bar claims made by former prisoners who are no longer incarcerated at the\ntime they bring/file their federal claims.  Therefore, Judge Homer, not being bound by the limited\npersuasive authority within this Circuit, correctly evaluated the issues presented by way of\nconsidering the opinions of courts from around the country that are on-point.\nDefendants have argued that leave to amend should be freely given if they have raised “at\nleast colorable grounds for relief”, and that given the Cox decision and the fact that the Second\nCircuit has not ruled on § 1997e(e) in the context of non-incarcerated plaintiffs in a published\n8\n\nopinion, Defendants’ arguments address an “open question” and are therefore “colorable”.  Defts’\nObj. (Dkt. No. 41) at 3 (citing, inter alia, Dow Corning Corp. v. Chem. Design, Inc., 3 F. Supp. 2d\n361, 364 (W.D.N.Y. 1998); S.S. Silberlatt, Inc. v. E. Harlem Pilot Block Bldg. 1 Hous. Dev. Fund\nCo., 608 F.2d 28, 42 (2d Cir. 1979)).  “Colorable”, when used as a description of a claim or defense,\nhas two general meanings, the more common of which in the present context is: “appearing to be\ntrue, valid, or right”.  The other meaning, from legal tradition, is: “[i]ntended to deceive;\ncounterfeit”.  BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 282 (8th ed. 2004).  See also BIW Deceived v. Local S6,\nIndus. Union of Marine & Shipbuilding Workers of Am., 132 F.3d 824, 832 n.4 (1st Cir. 1997);\nState of Missouri ex rel. Pemiscot County v. W. Sur. Co., 51 F.3d 170, 173 n.2 (8th Cir. 1995).  In\nthis case, if PLRA § 1997e(e) would not be applicable to bar the claims of the Plaintiffs, then it\nwould appear, without having to reach the actual merits of Defendants’ defense under PLRA           \n§ 1997e(e), that Defendants’ proposed affirmative defense would not be colorable - not\n“appearing...valid”.  It would be like claiming self-defense to a robbery charge - the defense is\ninapplicable in the given context, however “colorable” it might be in another context.  Considering\nthe Second Circuit’s decision in Greig, and given the wealth of settled case law on the PLRA from\nother parts of the nation, it does not appear that Defendants’ arguments are valid.  Thus,\nDefendants’ arguments fail on this point.\nFurthermore, Defendants argue that their amendment adding an affirmative defense under   \n§ 1997e(e) of the PLRA would not be futile because it is possible that the class, if and when\ncertified, could include individuals who are incarcerated - thus making § 1997e(e) applicable to\nthose plaintiffs.  See Defts’ Obj. (Dkt. No. 41) at 3-4.  But, Defendants’ argument fails.  True, this\nclass action has not yet been certified by the Court.  But, “prior to class certification pursuant to\n9\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23, the only plaintiff before the court is the representative party.”  Macro v. Indep.\nHealth Assoc., Inc., 180 F. Supp. 2d 427, 437 (W.D.N.Y. 2001) (citing Berthelot v. Stallworth, No.\nCiv.A. 99-3618, 2000 WL 222155 (E.D. La. Feb. 8, 2000) (concerning exercise of federal\njurisdiction over claims)).  Indeed, the general claims of the representative parties are of primary\nimportance, as well.  For example, the Second Circuit has held that if the claims of the named\nplaintiffs are found to be moot prior to class certification, the entire action is mooted.  See Comer v.\nCisneros, 37 F.3d 775, 798 (2d Cir. 1994).  The claims and/or positions of the named/representative\nplaintiffs are evaluated prior to class certification.  In this case, the representative plaintiffs - those\ncurrently before the Court - are John Kelsey and Timothy Wright.  Neither man was “confined in a\njail, prison, or other correctional facility” at the time of filing.  See Plntfs’ Mem. in Opp. to Defts’\nObj. (Dkt. No. 59) at 1.\nThus, in evaluating the claims and status of only those Plaintiffs in this proposed class\naction, in addition to the submissions of the parties and Judge Homer’s Order, this Court finds that\nJudge Homer’s determination that an amendment concerning an Affirmative Defense under PLRA \n§ 1997e(e) would be futile was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.  Furthermore, Judge\nHomer did not abuse his discretion in denying leave to amend the pleadings.\nIII.  Conclusion\nBased on the foregoing discussion, it is hereby\nORDERED, that Defendants’ Objections (Dkt. No. 41) to Judge Homer’s August 5, 2005\nMemorandum-Decision and Order are OVERRULED, and said Memorandum-Decision and Order\n(Dkt. No. 40) is AFFIRMED in its ENTIRETY; and it is further\n10\n\nORDERED, that Defendants WILL NOT be permitted to amend their Answer to assert an\nEighth Affirmative Defense at paragraph 39 of the pleading; and it is further\nORDERED, that the Clerk serve a copy of this Order on all parties.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDATED:  November 16, 2005\n    Albany, New York\n11",

BATES, JR., both individually \nand in his official capacity as Sheriff of the \nCounty of Schoharie, and JIM HAZZARD, \nboth individually and in his capacity as \nAdministrator of the Schoharie County Jail,\nDefendants. \n                                                                               \nMEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER\nPresently before the Court is a Motion by Defendants John S. Bates, Jr., Schoharie\nCounty Sheriff, Lieutenant Jim Hazzard, Schoharie County Jail Administrator, and Schoharie\nCounty (collectively “Defendants”) to certify for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1292(b) this Court’s Memorandum-Decision and Order of February 21, 2007 (“February 2007\nOrder”).  Defts’ Motion for Appellate Cert. (Dkt. No. 84).  The February 2007 Order granted \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to certify this action as a class action, and denied Defendants’ Motion for\nsummary judgment.  See February 2007 Order (Dkt. No. 82).  For the following reasons, the\nCourt denies Defendants’ Motion to certify the February 2007 Order for interlocutory appeal.  \n1\n\nI. Background\nPlaintiffs John Kelsey (“Kelsey”) and Timothy Wright (“Wright”) (collectively\n“Plaintiffs”) filed suit, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, alleging that the\nSchoharie County Sheriff’s Department (“SCSD”) has an unconstitutional policy and/or practice\nof strip searching all individuals, including those charged with misdemeanors or held on civil\nmatters, who enter the Schoharie County Jail (“SCJ”) regardless of the crime with which they are\ncharged.  Compl. (Dkt. No. 1) at ¶ 1.  The Court presumes familiarity with the facts of this\naction, which are contained in the February 2007 Order. \nII. Discussion\nSection 1292(b) “allows permissive appeals of non-final interlocutory orders that involve:\n(1) a controlling question of law over which there is (2) a substantial ground for difference of\nopinion and which (3) will likely materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” \nNat’l Asbestos Workers Med. Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 71 F. Supp. 2d 139, 161 (E.D.N.Y.\n1999) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)).  Even if the moving party satisfies these criteria, a district\ncourt retains “unfettered discretion” to deny certification for appeal.  Id. at 162.  If a district court\ncertifies the order for appeal, however, the court of appeals must also agree to hear the case\nbefore an interlocutory appeal can proceed.  Id. at 161.  The Second Circuit “has repeatedly\nadvised [that] section 1292(b) was designed to be a rarely used exception to the final judgment\nrule.”  Id.; see also Ryan v. Fakih, 275 F. Supp. 2d 393, 395 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (collecting cases).\n2\n\nTo determine whether there is a controlling question of law for purposes of section\n1292(b), courts consider whether: “reversal of the district court’s opinion could result in\ndismissal of the action; reversal of the district court’s opinion, even though not resulting in\ndismissal, could significantly affect the conduct of the action; or, the certified issue has\nprecedential value for a large number of cases.”  Oxygenated Fuels Ass’n v. Pataki, 204 F. Supp.\n2d 337, 340 (N.D.N.Y. 2002) (Mordue, D.J.).  Defendants note that if the Second Circuit\nreversed this Court’s decision sustaining Kelsey’s and Wright’s individual claims, this action\nwould be terminated.  See Defts’ Mem. of Law (Dkt. No. 84, Attach. 4) at 3.  The fact that a\nreversal of the Court’s decision would terminate the case strengthens Defendants’ argument for\ncertification.  The “question of law” at issue should refer to “a ‘pure’ question of law that the\nreviewing court ‘could decide quickly and cleanly without having to study the record.’” \nAristocrat Leisure Ltd. v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams., 426 F. Supp. 2d 125, 128 (S.D.N.Y.\n2005) (quoting Ahrenholz v. Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Illinois, 219 F.3d 674, 676-77 (7th Cir.\n2000).  While the resolution of certain factual disputes are key to disposing of the instant case,\nDefendants do raise a legal issue as to whether a corrections officer observing an inmate in a\nstate of undress is a “strip search” that must be supported by reasonable suspicion; this issue\ncould be determined without factual development and would dispose of the case.  See Defts’\nMem. of Law (Dkt. No. 84, Attach. 4) at 4. \nHowever, Plaintiffs argue that there is no substantial ground for difference of opinion\nwith regard to the Court’s holding that observing an inmate newly admitted on a non-felony\ncharge in a state of undress is a “strip search” that must be supported by reasonable suspicion. \nPlntfs’ Mem. in Response (Dkt. No. 86, Attach. 4) at 3.  In order to determine whether there is\n3\n\n“substantial ground for difference,” the Court “must analyze the strength of the arguments in\nopposition to the challenged ruling, and determine whether there is ‘substantial doubt’ that the\ndistrict court’s order was correct.”  In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Prods. Liab. Litig., 399 F.\nSupp. 2d 320, 322-323 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  As\nexplained in the February 2007 Order, the Court’s holding is consistent with Circuit precedent\nand Judge Hurd’s decision in Marriot v. County of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y.\n2005), aff’d No. 05-1590-cv, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 25428 (2d Cir. Nov.22, 2005).  See\nFebruary 2007 Order (Dkt. No. 82) at 13-15.  \nHowever, Defendants, as they did in their Motion for summary judgment, argue that the\noral decision in Steinberg v. County of Rockland, No. 04-CV-4889 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2005),\nDkt. No. 84, Attach. 3, and decisions by the U.S. Courts of Appeal for the First and Seventh\nCircuits reach different conclusions than the Court’s Order and represent substantial ground for\ndifference with that Order.  See Defts’ Reply (Dkt. No. 87, Attach. 1) at 2.  However, the Court\ndoes not believe that the cases relied on by Defendants support their contention; nor would the\nexistence of a limited number of dissenting and non-binding decisions “present ‘the exceptional\ncircumstances’ justifying an interlocutory appeal.”  Richards v. FleetBoston Fin. Corp., No. 3:04-\ncv-1638 (JCH), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77150, at *6 (D. Conn. Oct. 16, 2006) (quoting Flor v.\nBot Fin. Corp., 79 F.3d 281, 284 (2d Cir. 1996) (finding that circumstances did not justify\ncertifying an interlocutory appeal despite recent Seventh Circuit and Southern District of New\nYork decisions conflicting with the court’s previous ruling).  Therefore, the Court finds that there\nis not “substantial doubt” that its Order was correct, and judicial resources would be conserved\nby avoiding an interlocutory appeal before the facts of the case are fully settled.  Accordingly, the\n4\n\nCourt declines to certify its February 2007 Order for interlocutory appeal.\nIII. Conclusion\nAccordingly, it is hereby\nORDERED, that Defendants’ Motion to certify the February 2007 Order for\ninterlocutory appeal (Dkt. No. 84) is DENIED; and it is further\nORDERED, that the Clerk serve a copy of this Order on all parties.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDATED: May 24, 2007\nAlbany, New York\n5",

This  is  a  class  action  brought  to  redress  the Defendants’ violation of the Plaintiffs’ and \nproposed Class members’ Constitutional rights.  The Schoharie County Sheriff’s Department has \na  policy  and/or  practice  of  strip  searching  all  individuals  who  enter  the  Schoharie  County  Jail, \nregardless of the crime upon which they are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is \npart  of  the  written  procedures  of  the  Schoharie  County  Sheriff’s  Department,  and  was \npromulgated  by  senior  Department  officials;  specifically,  Defendants  Sheriff  John  S.  Bates  and \n \n\n \nSchoharie  County  Jail  Administrator  Jim  Hazzard.    It  is  clearly  established  law  in  this  judicial \ncircuit  that  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors,  violations,  or  held  on  civil  matters  cannot  be \nstrip  searched  absent  individual,  reasonable  suspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  \nThus,  the  Defendants  have  maintained  and  implemented  an  unconstitutional  strip  search  policy  at \nthe Schoharie County Jail.    \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under  the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief \nfor the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured \nby the United States Constitution and Federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  This Court also \nhas jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §2201, as it is filed to obtain \ndeclaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n3.  Venue in this district is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving \nrise to Plaintiffs’ claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \n  PARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff John Kelsey (“Kelsey”) is 33 years old and resides in Cohoes, NY.  On or about \nOctober 16, 2002, Kelsey, after appearing in Albany County Family Court on a child support \nmatter, was arrested for a civil violation of the New York Family Court Act.  Kelsey was held in \nthe Schoharie County Jail because he worked, and continues to work, as a corrections officer in \nthe Albany County Jail.  \n5.  Plaintiff Timothy Wright (“Wright”) resides in Bennington, Vermont.  On or about \nSeptember 16, 2003, Wright was arrested for misdemeanor Driving While Intoxicated and held \n  2 \n\n \novernight at the Schoharie County Jail.   \n6.  Defendant County of Schoharie (the “County”) is a county government organized and \nexisting under the laws of the State of New York.  At all times relevant hereto, the County, \nacting through its Sheriff’s Department, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, \nimplementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Schoharie County Jail and was \nresponsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriff’s Department \npersonnel, including those working in the Schoharie County Jail (“SCJ”).  In addition, at all \nrelevant times, the County was responsible for enforcing the rules of the SCJ, and for ensuring \nthat Sheriff’s Department personnel employed in the Jail obeyed the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States and of the State of New York. \n7.  Defendant John F. Bates Jr. (“Bates”) is the duly elected Sheriff of Schoharie County, \nand, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees held \nat the SCJ.  Sheriff Bates’ principal place of business is 157 Depot Lane, Schoharie, New York, \nand he is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official capacities. \n8.  Defendant Jim Hazzard (“Hazzard”) is a Lieutenant in the Schoharie County Sheriff’s \nDepartment and is the Administrator of the Schoharie County Jail.  As such, Hazzard is a policy \nmaker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the SCJ exercises \ncustodial or other control.  Bates’ principal place of business is 157 Depot Lane, Schoharie, New \nYork, and he is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official capacities. \n  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n9.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals who were \n  3 \n\n \ncharged with misdemeanors, violations, or held on civil matters and were strip searched upon \ntheir entry into the Schoharie County Jail. \n  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons in the United States who have been or will be placed into the custody \nof the Schoharie County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations or \nheld on civil matters and were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the \nSchoharie County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the \nSchoharie County Sheriff’s Department and the County of Schoharie.  The class \nperiod commences on March 19, 2001, and extends to the date on which the \nSchoharie County Sheriff’s Department and/or the County of Schoharie are \nenjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, \npractice and custom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion. \n \nSpecifically excluded from the proposed class are Defendants, and all of their respective \naffiliates,  \n \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n \n10.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under \nFederal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy requirements for \nmaintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n11.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  Upon \ninformation and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors, violations, and \non civil matters who are placed into the custody of the Schoharie County Jail every year, all \nwhom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed \nclass totals at least 750 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on \nmultiple occasions. \n12.  Joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable because of the large number of class \nmembers and the fact that class members are likely to be dispersed over a large geographical \n  4 \n\n \narea, with some members presently residing outside of Schoharie County and this Judicial \nDistrict.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income \npersons, may not speak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights \nindividually. \n13.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that they all \nhad their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’ conducting strip \nsearches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were charged with \nmisdemeanors, violations, or were held on civil matters when placed into the custody of the \nSchoharie County Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established \nlaw in this judicial circuit. \n14.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiffs and all \nmembers of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ course of conduct.   \n15.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the class \nmembers. \n16.  The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this \naction and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.   \n17.  Plaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n18.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in the \nprosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.   \n19.  The named Plaintiffs are being represented by Elmer Robert Keach, III, along with Bruce \nMenken and Jason Rozger of Berenbaum Menken & Ben-Asher LLP.  Mr. Keach is an \nexperienced civil rights and class action attorney who has litigated a wide variety of civil rights \n  5 \n\n \nactions before this Court, and has litigated class action lawsuits in state and federal courts in five \nstates.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated a strip search case against the Troy City Police \nDepartment, and has previously litigated two other cases against the Schoharie County Sheriff’s \nDepartment, including one on behalf of a sixteen year old girl raped by a Corrections Officer. \n20.  Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger are both experienced civil rights attorneys from New \nYork City, having litigated scores of civil rights cases against a number of Defendants, including \none prison brutality case presently pending in this District.  Mr. Menken and Mr. Rozger have \nsuccessfully represented many victims of illegal strip searches, including two who opted out of \nthe recent class action litigation against the City of New York.  In addition, all of Plaintiff’s \nattorneys represent proposed class actions against two other local jails over their strip search \npolicies that are pending in this district.  On one of those cases, a settlement in principle has been \nreached, subject to approval by the court. \n21.   Counsel for Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among members of the class, or between \ncounsel and members of the class. \n22.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiffs’ seek \nclass certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members were subject to the \nsame policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged with misdemeanor or \nminor crimes and placed into the custody of the Schoharie County Jail.  In short, the Defendants \nacted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n23.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiffs seek \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n24.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and predominate \n  6 \n\n \nover any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These common questions of \nlaw and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate question of whether the \nDefendants’ policy of strip searching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes \nand committed to the Schoharie County Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution. \n25.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication \nof this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the class is impracticable \ngiven the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a large \ngeographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would make it \ndifficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to them.  \nThe cost to the federal court system of adjudicating hundreds of individual cases would be \nenormous.  Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and \nthe court system.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents \nfar fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, \nand protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n26.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals.  \n27.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, such as \nthe Individual Defendants in this action, from performing strip searches of arrestees who have \nbeen charged with misdemeanors, violations, or are held on civil matters unless the officer has \nreasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n28.  Upon information and belief, the Defendants maintain a policy, custom or practice of \n  7 \n\n \nstrip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Schoharie County Jail, regardless of \nthe nature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that \nthe individual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n29.  The Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a \npolicy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion.  This \njudicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may not strip search individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or violations absent particularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle \nbeing clearly established in 1986 in Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986).  \n30.  The Defendants’ policy, practice and custom mandating wholesale strip searches of all \nmisdemeanor and violation arrestees has been promulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad \nfaith and contrary to clearly established law. \n31.  Upon information and belief, not only is the policy of strip searching illegal, but the \nmanner in which individuals are searched is also impermissible.  For example, upon information \nand belief, individuals are strip searched in a public area and in the presence of multiple \ncorrections officers, jail employees and other arrestees, including arrestees of the opposite \ngender. \n  FACTS APPLICABLE TO NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n32.  Kelsey’s experience is representative of the class members’.  On or about October 16, \n2002, Kelsey was in Albany Family Court on a child support matter.  After appearing in Family \nCourt, Kelsey was charged with a civil violation of the Family Court Act, and arrested.   \n33.  Because Kelsey works as a corrections officer in the Albany County Jail, he was taken to \nthe Schoharie County Jail. \n  8 \n\n \n34.  Upon arrival at the SCJ, Kelsey was taken to the booking area, which is in full view of all \nof the SCJ’s holding cells.   \n35.  Once in the booking area, Kelsey was ordered by a SCJ corrections officer to remove all \nof his clothing and hand those clothes to the officer.  Kelsey complied. \n36.  Once Kelsey had stripped naked, the corrections officer inspected Kelsey’s naked body \nand searched the clothing that Kelsey was wearing. \n37.  The corrections officer then gave Kelsey a jail uniform to put on.   \n38.  On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Kelsey \nwas concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Kelsey that \ncould have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.   \n39.  Moreover, because Kelsey had already been in the custody of police officers from the \nCity of Albany, the corrections officer in question knew or should have known that Kelsey had \nalready been subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed any weapons or \ncontraband. \n40.  Timothy Wright’s experience is representative as well.  On or about September 16, 2003, \nWright was arrested for  Driving While Intoxicated, a misdemeanor under New York’s Vehicle \nand Traffic Law, and taken to the Schoharie County Jail.   \n41.  Upon arrival at the SCJ, Wright was taken to the booking area, which is in full view of all \nof the SCJ’s holding cells.   \n42.  Once in the booking area, Wright was ordered by a SCJ corrections officer to remove all \nof his clothing and hand those clothes to the officer.  Wright complied. \n43.  Once Wright had stripped naked, the corrections officer inspected Wright’s naked body \n  9 \n\n \nand searched the clothing that Wright was wearing. \n44.  The corrections officer then gave Wright a jail uniform to put on.   \n45.  On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Wright \nwas concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Wright that \ncould have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion, and nothing of the circumstances of \nthe arrest or the nature of the crime charged gave rise to such reasonable suspicion.   \n  CAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS: \nVIOLATION  \n  OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF STATE LAW \n \n46.  Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation  stated  in \nparagraphs 1 through 45. \n47.  The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  protects  citizens  from \nunreasonable  searches  by  law  enforcement  officers,  and  prohibits  officers  from  conducting  strip \nsearches  of  individuals  arrested  for  misdemeanors,  violations,  or  on  civil  matters    absent  some \nindividual, particular suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n48.  The  actions  of  Defendants  detailed  above  violated  Plaintiffs’  rights  under  the  United \nStates Constitution.   \n49.  It  was  not  objectively  reasonable  for  the  Defendants  to  maintain  a  policy  of  strip \nsearching Plaintiffs and class members.  \n50.  These  strip  searches  were  conducted  pursuant  to  the  policy,  custom  or  practice  of  the \nDefendants.    As  such,  the  Defedants  are  directly  liable  for  the  damages  of  the  named  Plaintiffs \nand members of the Class. \n  10 \n\n \n51.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  Bates  and  Hazzard  are  responsible  for \nestablishing  the  policies  and  procedures  to  be  utilized  in  the  operation  of  the  Schoharie  County \nJail,  and  are  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  unconstitutional  strip  search  policy  and/or \npractice.  As such, Bates and Hazzard are  each individually responsible for the damages of the \nnamed Plaintiffs and members of the Class.    \n52.  Bates  and  Hazzard  knew  that  the  SCJ’s  strip  search  policy  was  illegal,  and  acted \nwillfully,  knowingly,  and  with  specific  intent  to  deprive  Plaintiffs  and  members  of  the  Class  of \ntheir Constitutional rights. \n53.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \ngiven that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n54.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unconstitutional  acts  described  above,  Plaintiffs \nhave been irreparably injured. \n  AS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS: \n  DEMAND FOR DECLARATORY JUDGEMENT \n \n55.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 54. \n56.  The policy, custom and practice of the Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed \ninto the Schoharie County Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons. \n57.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory judgment, \nand that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Schoharie and the Schoharie County \n  11 \n\n \nSheriff’s Department to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS: \nDEMAND FOR A PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \n58.  Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation  stated  in \nparagraphs 1 through 57. \n59.  The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Defendants  is  clearly  unconstitutional,  in  that \nthese  entities  and  individuals  are  directing/conducting  the  strip  searches  of  all  individuals  placed \ninto  the  Schoharie  County  Jail  without  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons. \n60.  Upon  information  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in  place  at  the  Schoharie  County \nJail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have \nalready been inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs.   \n61.  The  continuing  pattern  of  strip  searching  individuals  charged  with  minor  crimes  will \ncause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, as well as the named \nPlaintiffs should they ever be arrested again, for which an adequate remedy does not exist at law. \n62.  Plaintiffs  demand  that  the  Defendants  immediately  desist  from  strip  searching  individuals \nplaced into the custody of the Schoharie County Jail absent any particularized suspicion that the \nindividuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or  weapons,  and  seek  both  a  preliminary  and \npermanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \n  AS AND FOR A FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DEFENDANTS \n  JOHN S. BATES JR. and JIM HAZZARD: DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE TO  \n  TRAINING AND SUPERVISION \n \n  12 \n\n \n63.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 62. \n64.  The above Defendants were deliberately indifferent in the training and supervision of the \nindividual officers employed at the Schoharie County Jail, in that Defendants were deliberately \nindifferent in discharging their duty to make sure that any strip searches conducted at the \nSchoharie County Jail were performed only in circumstances permitted by the United States \nConstitution.    \n65.  The above Defendants knew, or should have known, that unconstitutional strip searches \nwere, or were likely to be, taking place in the Schoharie County Jail.   \n66.  Despite this knowledge the above Defendants did not act to stop these unconstitutional \npractices from occurring.   \n67.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \ngiven that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n68.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiffs have \nbeen irreparably injured.   \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n69.  The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  John  Kelsey  and  Timothy  Wright,  on  behalf  of  themselves  and  on \nbehalf  of  a  class  of  others  similarly  situated,  request  that  this  Honorable  Court  grant  them  the \nfollowing relief: \n  13 \n\n \nAn order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed.
