The policy at issue required that all persons to be housed in the Detention Center be strip searched for weapons and contraband, regardless of the offense charged and whether or not there was individualized reasonable suspicion that the search would lead to the discovery of contraband or weapons. Plaintiffs maintained that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.  They sought monetary damages and injunctive relief. Management & Training Corporation (the company that was contracted to operated the Detention Center), the Santa Fe County Board of Commissioners and Santa Fe County Sheriffs were named as defendants.</p><p>From January 2005 through November 2005, the parties engaged in extensive discovery, including document production, numerous depositions, inspection of the Detention Center and analysis of over 31,000 individual booking records.  Settlement talks began in 2005 and included a six day mediation session before retired District Court Judge Raul A. Ramirez of California.  Negotiations continued until a deal was reached in June 2006.</p><p>On July 24, 2006, the District Court (District Judge Bruce D. Black) preliminarily approved the Stipulation of Settlement and certified the case as a class action.</p><p>Following a fairness hearing, the District Court entered its final order approving the settlement and closing the case on December 8, 2006.  Under the terms of the settlement, defendants agreed to pay $8.5 million into a settlement fund.  Up to $5,529,750.00, plus interest earned on the settlement fund, would be allocated to pay verified claims.  If the total amount of verified claims exceeded that amount, the amount payable to each member for each claim would be proportionately reduced.  If the total amount of verified claims was less than that amount, the balance would be refunded to the defendants. $2 million was allocated for attorneys' fees and costs, and $470,250.00 was allocated equally among the class representatives. Up to $500,000 was to be paid for claims administration costs, with restrictions to come into play if administration expenses incurred were more or less than that amount.  </p><p>The case is now closed.</p>",

I am an attorney with the finn of Sutin, Thayer & Browne P .C.  I was a partner \nwith the Sutin fInn from 1970 to 1983, then rejoined the funn from 1987 to 1990, and again in \nJuly 0[2005.  Prior to my rejoining the Sutin finn, I was a shareholder with the finn or Eaves, \nBardacke, Baugh, Kiernan & Larsen, P.A. from 1990 to 2005.  Prior to my joining the Eaves, \n\nBardacke firm, I was Attorney General of the State of New Mexico from 1983 to 1986. \n2.  I have practiced law since 1969.  I am admitted to practice law in California \n(1969) and New Mexico (1970).  I am also admitted to practice before the United States District \nCourt, District of New Mexico; U.S. Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit; U.S. Court of Appeals, \nNinth Circuit; and the United States Supreme Court. \n3.  I graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara (B.A. Cum Laude \n1966) and received my juris doctor from the University of California at Berkeley, Boalt Hall in \n1969.  Since 1969. I have maintained an active litigation practice.  My firm and I specialize in \ni \nmajor complex litigation, and I regularly appear before all levels of state and federal courts in \nNew Mexico and elsewhere.  I have represented the State of New Mexico in State o/New Mexico \n,J.;  \n,!~ \nex. Rei. Tom Udall v. The American Tobacco, et ai, prosecuting the lawsuit against major  i \n,t  \ntobacco companies and was successful in obtaining a $1.16 billion settlement, the largest civil  I \nI \nsettlement in the history of the State of New Mexico.  I \n! \n4.  My previous finn and I were one of the counsel in In Re: Lease Oil Antitrust \nL \nLitigation (11), a class action in the United States District for the Southern District of Texas; a \nglobal settlement of approximately $164.2 million was approved in that case.  My previous finn \nand I were also one of the counsel in In Re: New Mexico Vitamins Indirect Purchaser Antitrust \nLitigation filed in the Second Judicial District Court in Bernalillo County.  A nationwide class \nwas certified in the District of Columbia. a settlement was negotiated, and the New Mexico \nDistrict Court granted approval on April 19, 2002. \n5.  In addition, I am counsel in a number of class actions brought under the common \nf \nlaw and the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act against various life insurance companies on behalf \n\" \n2 \n\nof a class of persons who purchased life insurance policies and who, by paying premiums on a \nmonthly basis, were paying premiums greater than the guaranteed annual premium specified in \ntheir policies. Nationwide classes were certified as part of a settlement in many of these cases, \nand in others, certification was granted by the court and the cases are still pending. \n6.  In addition to the complex cases set forth above, I have tried or settled numerous \nlitigation matters in New Mexico involving complex disputes against well-financed and \naggressively represented adversaries. \n7.  I also maintain an active mediation practice in which I have successfully mediated \nnumerous complex litigation matters involving multiple parties and complex issues of law and \nfact, including class actions. \nI,  \n8.  In connection with my litigation practice, I have been paid on both an hourly and \ncontingent basis.  Based on my litigation and mediation experience, I am familiar with fair and \nreasonable rates for legal work in New Mexico and the amount of time reasonably necessary to \nbe invested in complex litigation matters. \n9.  I have been asked by Plaintiffs' counsel to express an opinion concerning the \nPlaintiffs' request for approval of their attorneys fees and costs in this matter.  In order to render \nmy opinion, I have reviewed the materials provided by Plaintiffs' counsel, including the \npleadings, the settlement agreement, the motion for fmal approval, the brief in support of \napproval of attorneys fees and costs, and the affidavits in support of same.  I have also reviewed \nand am familiar with the attorneys fees in similar cases, and the law applicable to attorneys fees \nI \nawards. \n10.  A case such as this one is risky and time-consuming to bring to a successful  \",.  \n3 \n\nresolution.  Such a complex, difficult case can require thousands of hours of attorney and staff \ntime and, had plaintiffs' counsel lost at either the certification stage of the proceedings or at trial, \nthey would have received no compensation for all of their efforts.  Moreover, a case of this type \nagainst defendants with significant resources such as Defendant Management & Training \nCorporation can require significant amounts of out-of-pocket expenses.  Had plaintiffs not \nprevailed, they would have lost their entire investment in the case.  The knowledge that \nsubstantial investments oftime and out-of-pocket costs would be required, with no guarantee of \nreimbursement, also made this case very risky. \n11.  The settlement in this case represents an excellent result.  Through the Plaintiffs' \n, \nefforts, an unconstitutional strip search policy at the Santa Fe County Detention Center was  ,'\"  \n, \nabolished.  In addition, the Plaintiffs secured a substantial settlement fund to compensate those  ,Li   \ni \nindividuals who were subjected to such unconstitutional strip searches.  Given the nature of the \nI \nI \nrisk undertaken by Class Counsel and the very favorable result obtained in this case, Class \n! \nCounsel are entitled to be fully and fairly compensated for their efforts.  This is particularly true \ni \nas the amount to be paid to Class Counsel will not reduce the amount to be paid to the Class \n, \nI' \nMembers.  i, \nt \n12.  It is my experience that in the vast majority of class action settlements in New \nMexico and elsewhere, attorneys fees are awarded based on a percentage of the recovery method. \nThis is the method consistently used by the District Court for the District of New Mexico, and \nhas also just been adopted by the New Mexico Court of Appeals.  Under the percentage of \nrecovery method, it is typical to award attorneys fees in the range of 25% or more of the total \nrecovery (i.e., the total monetary benefit recovered for the benefit of the class, including attorneys \n4 \n\n~ \nl,'  \nfees, costs and claims administration expenses). \n13.  In this case, the Parties engaged in anns-length negotiations and agreed that the \nDefendants would pay $2,000,000 for Plaintiffs' reasonable attorneys fees and costs, subject to \nthe Court's approval.  In New Mexico, it is customary to charge clients gross receipts tax on \n! \nattorneys fees, and courts customarily award gross receipts tax in addition to attorneys fees.  It is \nmy understanding that the Plaintiffs' reasonably incurred out-of-pocket expenses are \napproximately $110,000.  Thus, the agreed-upon payment of $2,000,000 breaks down to \n$110,000 in costs, $1,756,098 in fees, and $133,902 in gross receipts tax.  ; \nI \n14.  In my opinion, the amount of fees and costs agreed upon by the Parties through \nanTIs-length negotiations is very fair and reasonable and should be approved.  The attorneys fee  i \nl \nrepresents approximately 21 % of the total fund recovered for the benefit of the class \n($8,500,000), which is on the very low end of commonly approved attorneys fees in similar class \naction litigation. \n15.  I have also examined this fee as cross-checked against the Plaintiffs' lodestar.  I \nhave reviewed the materials supplied by Plaintiffs' counsel and understand that the Plaintiffs' \nraw lodestar (to date) is $539,225.  Thus, the agreed-upon fee of$I,756,098 is equal to applying \na multiplier of approximately 3.26 to the raw lodestar.  In my experience, multipliers in this \nrange are routinely approved in similar class action litigation and this further supports the \nreasonableness of the requested attorneys fee. \n16.  With respect to the hourly rates used by Class Counsel for detennining the raw \nlodestar, I am familiar with the range of rates charged by counsel who have the experience and \nf \nability to take on such litigation.  For New Mexico counsel, such rates range between $175 hour  1: \n5 \n\nfor associates to $375 per hour for more senior partners.  I am familiar with the work product, \nexperience, reputation and competence of Class Counsel in this case.  In my opinion, the rates \n, \nused by Class Counsel ($300 per hour for partners Robert R. Rothstein, Mark H. Donatelli and \nJohn C. Bienvenu), their associates ($200 per hour) and their staff ($100 per hour for legal \n,b  \n-\nassistants) for calculating the raw lodestar are fair and reasonable and fully justified, compared to \nwhat comparable lawyers in this locality charge and receive for work of similar complexity. \n17.  In addition, in my opinion the amount of time required by Class Counsel to bring \nthis case to a successful resolution was reasonable and evidences an efficient and economical \n~ \napproach to this litigation, while at the same time giving due attention to the many complexities \nof this case.  ,I.  \ni-\nL \n18.  I have also reviewed the SlliDITIary of costs incurred by Class Counsel on behalf of  , \nthe Plaintiffs and the Class.  I find these costs to be reasonable in amount.  They should be fully \nreimbursed. \n19.  I am familiar with the economic realities of practicing in a small law finn.  It is \ndifficult and risky for a small law finn to take on large-scale litigation such as this, which \nrequires significant and sometimes overwhelming investment of time and money, with no \ncertainty of recovery, and with payment received, if at all, many years after the work is begun. \nCounsel who agree to take on such cases, especially those which clearly vindicate the public \ninterest as is true in this case, deserve to be fully and fairly compensated for their efforts.  Such \ncompensation is not in any way a windfall, especially when compared to attorneys who are paid \nt \non an hourly rate, on a monthly basis, with no risk whatsoever. \n19.  In sum, it is my opinion that the amount negotiated and agreed to by the Parties in  \" \n6 \n\nthis case for fees and costs is consistent with the law, consistent with and even on the low end of \nfees awarded in similar cases, and is fair and reasonable and should be approved. \nFURTHER AFFIANT SA YETH NAUGHT. \nthisO\\~ay \nSUBSCRIBED AND SWORN TO before me  of November, 2006, at Santa \nFe, New Mexico. \n~~ \not  Pubhc \nMy commission expires:  r \nI \n, \nl \ni \nI \n, \n, \nI \nr \nu \n7 ",

Santa Fe County Sheriff Greg Solano, in his individual and official \ncapacities, and Former Santa Fe County Sheriff Raymond L. Sisneros, in his individual \nand oflicial capacities (\"Santa Fe County Defendants\") (hereinafter collectively referred \nExhibit A \n\nto as \"the Parties\"), by and through their respective counsel, hereby submit the following \nStipulation of Settlement (\"Stipulation of Settlement\"). \nI. \nRECITALS \nOn January 12.2005, Plaintiffs. on behalfllfthemselves and all persons similarly \nsituated, Ii led a complaint in the above-captioned matn.'r in which they ~hallenged certain \npractices of Defendants including the strip search of certain detainees, and sought \ndamages and declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs allege that they were unlawfully \nsubjected to strip searches performed pursuant to the policies, practices and customs of \nDefendants of conducting strip searches of all in('oming pre-arraignment detainees. \nPlaintiffs allege that these strip searches were performed without regard to the nature of \nthe alleged otIcnses for which Plaintiffs had been arrested. and without Defendants \nhaving a reasonable belief that the Plaintiffs so searched possessed weapons or \ncontraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable belief that the searches \nwould produce contraband or weapons. \nPlaintif(~ sought damages for civil rights \\'iolations under 42 U.S.c. § 1983, and \nfor claims arising under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act and l'ew Mexico comlllon \nlaw.  Plaintiffs additionally sought a judgment declaring that Defendants must cease the \nactivities described herein and enjoining Defendants from any fUl1her strip searches \nwithout individualized reasonable suspicion.  PlaintitYs brought this action on their own \nbehalf and on behalfofa class of similarly situated individuals. \nThe MTC Defendants contend that the admissions search policies at the Santa Fe \nCounty Adult Detention Center were and arc reasonably related to legitimate penological \n-2-\n\ninterests in deterring the introduction of weapons. drugs and other contraband into the \ndetention center.  As such, Defendants submit that detention ccnter policies are entitled to \ndeference under thc law, and that the policies should not be found to violate the \nConstitution or any state law.  Defendants deny that all of the PlaintifTs were subject to \nstrip scarches upon admission to the detention center. and they deny that all pre \narraignmcnt detainees were strip searched during the period oftimc in question. \nDefendants further deny that scarches of the Plaintiff, violatcd any state or federal \nstatutory or common law. \nThc Santa Fe County Defendants deny any and all liability fur their own acts and \nomissions and deny any liability for the acts and olllissions by indcpcndent contractor \nMTC and MTC's employees.  The Santa Fe County Defendants contend that Count II \nfails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted undcr the Ncw Mexico Tort Claims \nAct.  In addition, Defendant Solano and Defendant Sisncros affinnativcly asscrt that they \nhad no role whatsoever in the formulation or implemcntation ofMTC's strip search \npolicies and have no individual responsibility or liability for any of the alkgedly \nunconstitutional policies, practices or acts of the MTC Defendants, and they also asscrt \nqualificd imlllunity as to the violations of 42 U.S.c. ~ 1993 alleged in the complaint.  In \naddition, Defendants assert that a elass action is inappropriate and that the claim for \ninjunctive relicf is moot. \nThe Partics entercd into extensive discovery which included cxchangc of \ndocuments, preparation of and responses to requests fiJr production of documents, and \ndepositions. \n-3-\n\nThe Parties engaged in six days of mediation sessions with retired United States \nDistrict Judge Raul A.

MARQUEZ, MARK \nMILLER, COPPER PERRY, DAVID \nSANDOVAL, KRISTI SEIBOLD, RUSSELLA \nSERNA, and KIMBERLY WRIGHT,  \non their own behalf and on behalf of a class of \nsimilarly situated persons, \n \nPlaintiffs, \nvs.         \n  No. CIV 05 0036 BB/ACT \n \nSANTA FE COUNTY BOARD OF  \nCOMMISSIONERS; MANAGEMENT \n& TRAINING CORPORATION; \nSANTA FE COUNTY SHERIFF GREG       \nSOLANO, in his individual and official  \ncapacities; FORMER SANTA FE COUNTY \nSHERIFF RAYMOND L. SISNEROS, in his \nindividual and official capacities; and KERRY \nDIXON, in his individual and official capacities,            \n \nDefendants. \n \n  NOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF \n  SANTA FE COUNTY CLASS ACTION STRIP SEARCH CASE \n \nIf you were strip searched at intake and booking at the Santa Fe County Detention Facility \nbefore you were arraigned between January 12, 2002 and July 6, 2006, you may be entitled \nto monetary compensation under a proposed class action settlement. \n \nThere is presently pending a lawsuit filed as a class action in the United States District Court, \nDistrict of New Mexico.  The parties have proposed a settlement that, if it receives final \napproval, after all appeals, will provide that certain persons subject to strip searches at the Santa \nFe County Adult Detention Center will receive money.  Records of the Santa Fe County \nDetention Facility show that you were booked into the facility during the relevant time period.  \nTo receive monetary compensation in this pending settlement, you must fill out and mail a \nclaim form by November 6, 2006. \n \n  IF YOU WISH TO CLAIM MONETARY COMPENSATION,  \n  OBTAIN, FILL OUT AND MAIL THE CLAIM FORM AS SOON \n  AS POSSIBLE BUT NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 6, 2006. \n\n \n  For more information, please read this notice. \n \n  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY. \n  YOU MAY BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A PAYMENT. \n \nThere is now pending in the United States District Court, District of New Mexico, an action filed \nas a class action on behalf of persons allegedly illegally strip searched at the Santa Fe County \nDetention Facility between January 12, 2002 and July 6, 2006.  A Stipulation of Settlement, \napproved preliminarily by the Court, defines the class included in this settlement as follows: \n \nAll pre-arraignment detainees who were subjected to a strip search \nupon booking and intake to the Santa Fe County Detention Facility \nduring the Class Period (January 12, 2002 through July 6, 2006)  \nwithout individualized reasonable suspicion that the search would \nlead to the discovery of contraband or weapons, not including \npersons arrested or booked on charges involving drugs, weapons or \nviolence, substantially similar to those charges in Exhibit 3 to the \nStipulation of Settlement.    \n \nYou have received this Notice either because records of the Santa Fe County Detention Facility \nindicate that you may be in the class, or because you contacted the Claims Administrator.  \nWhether or not you qualify as a class member will be based upon the records of the Santa Fe \nCounty Detention Facility.  If these records do not contain your name and show you to be within \nthe definition of the class, you will not qualify. \n \nThis Notice is to inform you that a settlement has been proposed in this action and that, as a \npotential class member, your rights may be affected by the settlement.  This Notice also \nsummarizes the terms and effect of the proposed settlement, what you can do to participate in it, \nhow you may obtain money under the settlement, and what you must do if you choose to exclude \nyourself from the class. \n \n  SUMMARY OF THE CASE \n \nOn January 12, 2005, Plaintiffs Elizabeth Leyba, Natasha Apodaca, Nancy Ellin, Monica Garcia, \nLucy M. Marquez, Mark Miller, Copper Perry, David Sandoval, Kristi Seibold, Russella Serna, \nand Kimberly Wright (“Plaintiffs”), on behalf of themselves and all persons similarly situated, \nfiled a complaint in the above-captioned matter against Defendants Management & Training \nCorporation and Kerry Dixon, in his individual and official capacities  (“MTC Defendants”), and \nSanta Fe County Board of Commissioners, Santa Fe County Sheriff Greg Solano, in his \nindividual and official capacities, and former Santa Fe County Sheriff Raymond L. Sisneros, in \nhis individual and official capacities (“Santa Fe County Defendants”), in which they challenged \n \nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SANTA FE COUNTY STRIP SEARCH CLASS ACTION                  PAGE 2 OF 11 \n\ncertain practices of Defendants including the strip search of certain detainees, and sought \ndamages and declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs allege that they were unlawfully \nsubjected to strip searches performed pursuant to the policies, practices and customs of \nDefendants of conducting strip searches of all incoming pre-arraignment detainees.  Plaintiffs \nallege that these strip searches were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged \noffenses for which Plaintiffs had been arrested, and without Defendants having a reasonable \nbelief that the Plaintiffs so searched possessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts \nsupporting a reasonable belief that the searches would produce contraband or weapons.  \n \nPlaintiffs sought damages for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and for claims \narising under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act and New Mexico common law.  Plaintiffs \nadditionally sought a judgment declaring that Defendants must cease the activities described \nherein and enjoining Defendants from any further strip searches without individualized \nreasonable suspicion.  Plaintiffs brought this action on their own behalf and on behalf of a class \nof similarly situated individuals. \n \nThe MTC Defendants contend that the admissions search policies at the Santa Fe County Adult \nDetention Facility were reasonably related to legitimate penological interests in deterring the \nintroduction of weapons, drugs and other contraband into the detention center.  As such, \nDefendants submit that detention center policies are entitled to deference under the law, and that \nthe policies should not be found to violate the Constitution or any state law.  Defendants deny \nthat all of the Plaintiffs were subject to strip searches upon admission to the detention center, and \nthey deny that all pre-arraignment arrestees were strip searched during the period of time in \nquestion.  Defendants further deny that searches of the Plaintiffs violated any state or federal \nstatutory or common law. \n \nThe Santa Fe County Defendants deny any and all liability for their own acts and omissions and \ndeny any liability for the acts and omissions by independent contractor MTC and MTC’s \nemployees.  The Santa Fe County Defendants contend that Count II fails to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.  In addition, Defendant \nSolano and Defendant Sisneros affirmatively assert that they had no role whatsoever in the \nformulation or implementation of MTC’s strip search policies and have no individual \nresponsibility for any of the allegedly unconstitutional policies, practices or acts of the MTC \nDefendants, and they also assert qualified immunity as to the violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nalleged in the complaint. \n   \nIn addition, Defendants assert that a class action is inappropriate and that the claim for injunctive \nrelief is moot. \n \nThe Parties entered into extensive discovery which included exchange of documents, preparation \nof and responses to requests for production of documents, and depositions.  \n \n \nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SANTA FE COUNTY STRIP SEARCH CLASS ACTION                  PAGE 3 OF 11 \n\n \n  SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED TERMS \n \nA Stipulation of Settlement (“Settlement”) was entered into after intensive negotiations between \nthe parties, conducted with the assistance of a third party mediator.  The Parties are requesting \nthat the Court approve the Settlement. \n \nA.  Parties to the Settlement. \n \nThe Parties to the Settlement are the Plaintiffs, the MTC Defendants, and the Santa Fe County \nDefendants.   \n \nClass Counsel are Mark H. Donatelli, Robert R. Rothstein and John C. Bienvenu of the Law \nOffices of Rothstein, Donatelli, Hughes, Dahlstrom, Schoenburg & Bienvenu, LLP, 1215 Paseo \nde Peralta, P.O. Box 8180, Santa Fe, NM 87504-8180. \n \nB.    Defendants Do Not Admit Any Liability. \n \nPlaintiffs allege that the acts and/or omissions that are the subject of the claims covered by this \naction (strip searches) violated various state and federal laws.  Defendants deny all allegations of \nwrongdoing and deny any liability to Plaintiffs or to any other class members.  The Parties have \nagreed that, in order to avoid long and costly litigation, this controversy should be settled \npursuant to the terms of the Settlement, subject to approval of the Court. \n \nC.    Monetary Terms of the Settlement. \n \nThe total settlement fund (not including the separate settlement funds allocated for claims \nadministration expenses, as set forth below), which shall be used to pay all verified claims of \nSettlement Class Members (“SCMs”), administrative costs and attorneys’ fees, is up to \n$8,000,000 (Eight Million Dollars) (“Settlement Fund”).  In addition, up to $500,000.00 will be \npaid by the Santa Fe County Defendants for all claims administration expenses.  Within 30 days \nof preliminary approval by the United States District Court of the terms of the Stipulation of \nSettlement, Defendants will deposit the Settlement Fund in an interest-bearing Qualified \nSettlement Fund.  Funds will be distributed to SCMs and their counsel pursuant to an agreed \nupon Plan of Allocation.  If all funds deposited into the Settlement Fund are expended pursuant \nto the Plan of Allocation, then all interest earned on the Settlement Fund shall inure to the benefit \nof the Class.  The Settlement Fund will be allocated as follows: \n \na.  Subject to possible reduction in the funds available to SCMs, as provided in \nParagraphs 29 and 30 of the Stipulation of Settlement, up to $5,529,750.00 (plus \ninterest earned on the Settlement Fund, and any additional amounts allocated to \nthe Settlement Fund) will be allocated to pay verified claims, pursuant to the Plan \n \nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SANTA FE COUNTY STRIP SEARCH CLASS ACTION                  PAGE 4 OF 11 \n\nof Allocation (see below).  If the total amount of verified claims exceeds this \namount, or the amount reduced as provided in Paragraph 30 of the Settlement, the \namount payable to SCMs for each claim shall be reduced proportionately so that \nthe entire available amount in the Settlement Fund is paid out to SCMs.  If the \ntotal amount paid to SCMs is less than $5,529,750.00, or some lesser amount \npursuant to Paragraph 31 of the Settlement, the balance will be refunded to the \nDefendants; \n  \nb.  $2,000,000.00 will be allocated to Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, gross receipts tax on \nPlaintiffs’ attorneys fees, and litigation expenses incurred on behalf of Plaintiffs, \nsubject to approval of the Court.  Defendants agree not to contest Plaintiffs’ \nrequest for approval of this amount for fees, gross receipts tax, and litigation \nexpenses.  In the event the Court approves less than this amount, the balance \nremaining in the Settlement Fund will be added to the amount allocated to pay \nverified claims; and \n \nc.  $470,250.00 will be allocated equally among the class representative to \nacknowledge their participation and efforts in this lawsuit, separate and apart from \nany payment due for their individual claims as SCMs, subject to approval of the \nCourt.  Defendants agree not to contest Plaintiffs’ request for approval of this \npayments to class representatives.  In the event the Court approves less than this \namount, the balance remaining in the Settlement Fund will be added to the \namount allocated to pay verified claims.  \n \nd.  Separate and apart from the Settlement Fund, up to $500,000.00 will be paid by \nthe Santa Fe County Defendants for all claims administration expenses.  If the \ntotal amount of claims administration expenses incurred is more than $500,000, \nthen the allocation to pay verified claims will be reduced and such overage of \nadministrative costs shall be paid from the $5,529,750.00 allocated to the \nSettlement Fund.  If the total amount of claims administration expenses incurred \nis less than $500,000, then the balance remaining will be returned to Santa Fe \nCounty.  \n \ne.

      "text": "  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n  FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO \n \nELIZABETH LEYBA, et al., \n \n        Plaintiffs, \nvs.         No.   CIV-05-0036 BB/ACT \n \nSANTA FE COUNTY BOARD OF  \nCOMMISSIONERS; et al.,          \n \n     Defendants. \n \nMemorandum in Support of Approval of \nReasonable Attorneys Fees, Costs and Incentive Payments \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \nAs set forth in the Joint Unopposed Motion for Final Approval of Class Action \nSettlement Agreement, the Plaintiffs, the MTC Defendants and the Santa Fe County Defendants \n(the “Parties”) have agreed that $2,000,000 of the Settlement Fund will be allocated to Plaintiffs’ \nattorneys’ fees, gross receipts tax on fees, and litigation expenses, subject to approval of the \nCourt.  This amount breaks down as follows: attorneys fees: $1,756,098; gross receipts tax on \nfees: $133,902; litigation expenses:  $110,000.  In addition, the Parties have agreed that \n$470,250 of the Settlement Fund, representing $42,750 per Class Representative, will be \nallocated to incentive payments to the Class Representatives for their contribution to the \ninvestigation and prosecution of this case.   \n  As demonstrated below, and as supported by the separately submitted Affidavits of Paul \nBardacke, John C. Bienvenu, Robert R. Rothstein, Mark H. Donatelli and Elizabeth Leyba, these \namounts are consistent with well-settled federal law governing the determination of reasonable \nattorneys’ fees and incentive payments in class action litigation.  The amount sought for fees is \n\n \nsupported by every method used to analyze an award of fees: (1) it is less than the standard \n“bench-mark” common fund recovery of 25 – 30 % approved by federal courts in New Mexico \nand across the nation;  (2) it is less than a market-replicating contingency fee recovery of 33.33 – \n40 %; and (3) when cross-checked by a lodestar analysis, it results in a multiplier of 3.26, which \nis well within the range of commonly approved multipliers in similar litigation.  The incentive \npayments are similarly supported by the law and facts.  For all these reasons, the Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that the Court approve the Parties’ agreed-upon allocation formula.   \n  II.  BACKGROUND FACTS \n  A.  The course of the litigation \nPlaintiffs filed this lawsuit on January 12, 2005, on behalf of themselves and all other \npersons similarly situated, alleging that they were unlawfully subjected to strip searches \nperformed pursuant to the policies, practices and customs of Defendants of conducting strip \nsearches of all incoming pre-arraignment detainees without individualized reasonable suspicion.  \nAll the Defendants denied Plaintiffs’ claims.  The MTC Defendants contended that the \nadmissions search policies at the Santa Fe County Adult Detention Center were reasonably \nrelated to legitimate penological interests in deterring the introduction of weapons, drugs and \nother contraband into the detention center and were entitled to deference under the law, and that \nthe policies should not be found to violate the Constitution or any state law.  The MTC \nDefendants denied that all of the Plaintiffs were subject to strip searches upon admission to the \ndetention center, and they denied that all pre-arraignment detainees were strip searched during \nthe period of time in question.  The MTC Defendants further denied that searches of the \nPlaintiffs violated any state or federal statutory or common law. \n  2\n\n \nThe Santa Fe County Defendants filed a separate answer, similarly denying any and all \nliability for their own acts and omissions and denying any liability for the acts and omissions by \nindependent contractor MTC and MTC’s employees.  The Santa Fe County Defendants \ncontended that the Plaintiffs’ claims failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted \nunder the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.  In addition, Defendant Solano and Defendant Sisneros \naffirmatively asserted that they had no role whatsoever in the formulation or implementation of \nMTC’s strip search policies and have no individual responsibility or liability for any of the \nallegedly unconstitutional policies, practices or acts of the MTC Defendants, and they also \nasserted qualified immunity.   \nBetween January 2005 and November 2005, the Parties engaged in extensive discovery, \nincluding the exchange of voluminous documents, inspection of the detention center facility, and \ndepositions of all eleven named Plaintiffs, Defendants Kerry Dixon and Greg Solano, and other \ncorrectional officers and officials.  In addition, the Plaintiffs obtained and analyzed the \nvoluminous database maintained by the Defendants for all persons booked into the detention \ncenter during the relevant class period (numbering in excess of 31,000 individual bookings). \n  B.  The course of settlement negotiations \nIn mid-2005, the Parties agreed to enter into settlement discussions.  The Parties engaged \nin six days of mediation sessions with retired United States District Judge Raul A. Ramirez of \nSacramento, California.  See Affidavit of Attorney John C. Bienvenu, filed separately, ¶ 9.  \nAdditionally, the Parties engaged in a number of additional sessions among counsel for the \nParties.  Arms-length, contentious, and non-collusive settlement negotiations continued through \nJune 2006 when the Settlement Agreement was finally reached.  \n  3\n\n \n  From the very beginning of these negotiations, Plaintiffs made it clear that they would \nnot simultaneously discuss settlement of the class recovery and attorneys’ fees, but instead would \nonly address the issue of attorneys fees after reaching agreement on all other terms for the benefit \nof the class.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 10.  This approach is not mandated, but is preferable under certain \ncircumstances to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest.  See e.g. In re Prudential Ins. Co. \nof America Sales Practices Litig., 962 F.Supp. 572, 577 (D.N.J. 1997) (divorcing discussion of \nattorneys fees from negotiation of relief provided to class is preferred procedure as it “obviate[s] \nthe danger or an actual or apparent conflict of interest on the part of class counsel”); In re Mfrs. \nLife Ins.Co. Premium Litig., No. 1109, 96-CV-230 BTM (AJB), 1998 WL 1993385, at *6, *10 \n(S.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 1998) (noting the importance of “carefully avoid[ing] the discouraged \npractice of simultaneous negotiation of fees and the merits” and encouraging the practice of \n“secur[ing] attorneys’ fees and expenses without dipping into the class’s recovery”); MANUAL \nFOR COMPLEX LITIGATION (FOURTH), § 21.7 (separate negotiation of the class settlement before \nan agreement on fees is generally preferable). \nThe terms of the settlement are summarized as follows:  \n  1.  Monetary Relief to Settlement Class Members \n    a.  Payments to the Settlement Class \nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the MTC Defendants have deposited \nthe sum of $8,000,000 into an interest-earning qualified settlement fund account (“Settlement \nFund”) for payments to Class members, for payments of incentive compensation for each Class \nRepresentative, and for Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  In addition, the Santa Fe \n  4\n\n \nCounty Defendants agreed to pay an additional amount up to $500,000 for claims administration \nexpenses.  Thus, the total settlement fund created for the benefit of the class is $8,500,000.     \nThe Claims Administrator will pay out of the Settlement Fund to each Settlement Class \nmember who submits a valid and timely Claim Form a Settlement Payment calculated for that \nSettlement Class member under the proposed Plan of Allocation (attached to the Settlement \nAgreement as Exhibit 4).  Those payments range from a minimum of $200 to a maximum of \n$3,500.  The Parties have agreed that the amount allocated for payment of claims is $5,529,750.  \nIn the event that the total amount of verified claims exceeds the amount available in the \nSettlement Fund, the amount payable to each Settlement Class member will be reduced \nproportionately.  In the event that the total amount of verified claims is less than the amount \navailable in the Settlement Fund, the balance will be refunded to the MTC Defendants. \n     b.  Incentive Payments \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, the Parties have agreed that the Class Representatives \nare eligible to receive compensation for their contribution to the investigation and prosecution of \nthis case, in addition to the amounts to which they are entitled under the Plan of Allocation.  The \nParties have agreed that $470,250 of the Settlement Fund will be allocated for this purpose, \nsubject to approval of the Court, representing $42,750 per Class Representative.     \n     c.  Attorneys’ Fees, Gross Receipts Tax and Costs \n  The Parties have agreed that $2,000,000 of the Settlement Fund will be allocated to \nPlaintiffs’ attorneys fees, gross receipts tax on fees, and litigation expenses, subject to approval \nof the Court.  Litigation expenses incurred by Plaintiffs through November 27, 2006 are \napproximately $110,000.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 19.  Thus, the amount to be allocated to Plaintiffs’ \n  5\n\n \nattorneys fees is $1,756,098, and the amount to be allocated to gross receipts tax on Plaintiffs’ \nattorneys fees is $133,902 (at the current Santa Fe rate of 7.625%).  \n  2.  Equitable Relief \n  The Parties have stipulated and agreed that the strip search policies at the Santa Fe \nCounty Detention Center were changed as a result of Plaintiffs’ and Class Counsel’s efforts \npreceding and during this lawsuit.  \nC.  Claims Administration \n19,927 notice and claim form packages were sent to potential Class Members on \nSeptember 7, 2006.  In addition, information regarding the settlement agreement was published \nin the Albuquerque Journal, the Santa Fe New Mexican, and the Rio Grande Sun, in both English \nand Spanish.  Announcements were also made in English and Spanish on KABQ, KDCE, KKSS, \nand KJFA.  A website and toll-free telephone number were established to provide further \ninformation to potential Class Members.  See, Affidavit of Mark Patton, filed separately, ¶¶ 5-12. \nIn addition, Class Counsel undertook extensive outreach efforts in an effort to locate \npotential Class Members and inform them of the settlement and the procedure for filing claims.  \nClass Counsel developed a database to track contacts with all potential Class Members.  Class \nCounsel hired staff dedicated to making telephone and in-person contacts with potential Class \nMembers.  Class Counsel mailed thousands of additional notice packages and claim forms to \npotential Class Members.  Class Counsel published additional advertisements in various \nnewspapers, and placed additional radio advertisements in a number of radio stations in Santa Fe \nand Rio Arriba Counties.  Class Counsel invested many hundreds of hours in staff time and \n  6\n\n \napproximately $60,000 in these outreach efforts.  Class Counsel believe that these efforts directly \nresulted in doubling or tripling the number of Claim Forms received.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 26.     \nAs of November 29, 2006, 3,402 individuals had filed Claim Forms.  No Class Members \nobjected to the settlement; three individuals opted out of the settlement.  Class Counsel estimate \nthat the total amount of claims to be paid will be greater than $4,000,000, but somewhat less than \nthe amount allocated for payment of claims ($5,529,750).  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 27. \nThe balance remaining in the Settlement Fund after payment of claims will revert to the \nMTC Defendants.  The amounts allocated to attorneys fees, costs and incentive payments, then, \nwill not reduce or otherwise affect the recovery to the Class Members who have filed claims, but \ninstead will in effect be paid directly by the Defendants, as agreed by the Parties. \nIII.  THE PARTIES’ ALLOCATION OF ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS IS \nFAIR AND REASONABLE AND SHOULD BE APPROVED     \n \n  Two methods may be utilized to determine reasonable attorneys’ fees: (1) the percentage \nof the fund method (awarding fees based on a reasonable percentage of the overall recovery); \nand (2) the lodestar method (determining fees based on the hours worked, multiplied by a \nreasonable hourly rate and adjusted as appropriate by a multiplier).  As set forth below, federal \ncourts, including the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, have expressed a decided preference for the \npercentage of the fund method, and in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, that is \npresumptively the method to be used in determining a reasonable fee.  Under either approach, \nhowever, the fee agreed upon by the Parties in the present case is reasonable.  \n  A.  The percentage of recovery method of awarding attorneys fees \nis the preferred method in common fund cases \n \n  The Tenth Circuit has observed that despite advantages and disadvantages to the lodestar \n  7\n\n \nand percentage of the fund methodologies, the “recent trend has been toward utilizing the \npercentage method in common fund cases.”  Gottlieb v. Barry, 43 F.3d 474, 482 (10th Cir. 1994); \nsee also Rosenbaum v. MacAllister, 64 F.3d 1439, 1445 (10th Cir. 1995) (“[w]e have recently \nimplied ‘a preference for the percentage of the fund’ method in common fund cases”); MANUAL \nFOR COMPLEX LITIGATION (FOURTH), § 14.121 (the vast majority of courts of appeals now permit \nor direct district courts to use the percentage-fee method in common-fund cases).   \n  In 1985, the Third Circuit Task Force studied this issue and recommended that in \ncommon fund cases, fees should be based on the percentage-of-the-fund method and not on the \nlodestar method, finding numerous problems with use of the lodestar method in common fund \ncases.  Court Awarded Attorneys’ Fees: Report of the Third Circuit Task Force, 108 F.R.D. 237, \n255 (1986).  The lodestar method has been criticized by courts, commentators, and members of \nthe bar because it is difficult to apply, time-consuming to administer, inconsistent in result, and \ncreates an inherent incentive to prolong litigation.  MANUAL FOR COMPLEX LITIGATION, supra, \n§14.121; Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Babbitt, 50 F. Supp. 2d 1091, 1108 (D.N.M. 1999).    \n  After reviewing criticisms of the lodestar method and the findings of the Third Circuit \nTask Force, the Eleventh Circuit announced that the percentage of the fund, as opposed to the \nlodestar, would apply to all common fund cases.   Camden I Condominium Ass’n v. Dunkle, 946 \nF.2d 768, 774 (11th Cir. 1991).  The District of Columbia Circuit has followed suit, finding that \nthe percentage-of-the-fund method is preferred as it rewards prompt and efficient resolution of \nclass action litigation, while the lodestar approach’s reliance on attorney work hours conversely \nencourages inefficiency and resistance to prompt settlement.  Swedish Hosp. Corp. v. Shalala, 1 \nF.3d 1261, 1268 (D.C.Cir. 1993).   The D.C. Circuit further found that “a percentage-of-the-fund \n  8\n\n \napproach more accurately reflects the economics of litigation practice . . . and most closely \napproximates the manner in which attorneys are compensated in the marketplace for these types \nof cases.”  Id. at 1269 (citations omitted); see also, HIRSCH & DIANE, FED. JUDICIAL CTR., \nAWARDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND MANAGING FEE LITIGATION 65 (noting that the percentage \nmethod “ensure[s] that the fee award will simulate the marketplace, since most common fund \ncases are the kinds of cases normally taken on a contingency fee basis, with counsel promised a \npercentage of any recovery”).  \n  The percentage of the fund method is an appropriate method for determining reasonable \nfees even in the settlement of class actions involving fee-shifting statutes.  See e.g., Staton v. \nBoeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 967-68 (9th Cir. 2003) (common fund principles apply where a fee-\nshifting case settles before judgment); Brytus v. Spang & Co., 203 F.3d 238, 246-47 (3rd Cir. \n2000) (common fund fees are appropriate in both settled and litigated cases where statutory fees \nare available); Cook v. Niedert, 142 F.3d 1004 (7th Cir. 1998) (approving fees based on common \nfund rather than statutory principles, even where statutory fees were available).   \n  B.  Twenty-one percent of the common fund falls well within the \nnormal range of fee awards in common fund settlements \n \n  In calculating the percentage, it is appropriate to compare the fee to the total amount \nrecovered for the benefit of the class, even if some of the fund ultimately reverts to the \nDefendants because some class members choose not to claim their share.  Boeing Co. v. Van \nGemert, 444 U.S. 472 (1980) (attorneys fees must be based on the value of the entire common \nfund, even if some beneficiaries make no claim); accord,  Waters v. Intern. Precious Metals \nCorp., 190 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir. 1999); Williams v. MGM-Pathe Communications Co., 129 F.3d \n1026 (9th Cir. 1997).  It is also appropriate to include the amount of the attorneys fees in the \n  9\n\n \ncommon fund when calculating the proper percentage.  See MANUAL FOR COMPLEX LITIGATION, \nsupra, § 21.7 (proper calculation of settlement benefits includes all fee amounts paid by \ndefendant in addition to class relief.)  Thus, the $1.75 million fee agreed upon by the Parties \nrepresents 20.6% of the $8,500,000 common fund recovered for the benefit of the class.    \n  A leading commentator on class action litigation concluded as of 1992 that “no general \nrule” can be articulated as to what is a reasonable percentage of a common fund, but “[u]sually \nfifty percent of the fund is the upper limit on a reasonable fee award . . . though somewhat larger \npercentages are not unprecedented.”    3 NEWBERG & CONTE, NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § \n14.03 (3d ed. 1992).  Most courts that have surveyed fee awards in common fund settlements \nhave reached similar conclusions.   See e.g., Brown v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 838 F.2d 451, 455 \n(10th Cir. 1988) (surveying cases in which the percentage fee awarded ranged between 22% and \n37.3%); Swedish Hosp. Corp., 1 F.3d at 1272 (surveying cases and observing that common fund \nawards typically range between 20 and 30%); Camden I Condominium Ass’n, 946 F.2d at 774 (a \nmajority of common fund class action fee awards fall between 20 and 30%); In re Activision \nSecurities Litigation, 723 F. Supp. 1373, 1377 (N.D.Cal. 1989) (surveying cases and finding \naverage award of 30%); In re Warner Communications Sec. Litig., 618 F. Supp. 735, 749-50 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1985) (surveying cases with percentage fee awards averaging 30.6%, and finding that \ntraditionally courts have awarded fees in the 20 to 50% range in class actions); In re Dun & \nBradstreet Credit Services Customer Litig., 130 F.R.D. 366, 372 (S.D. Ohio 1990) (fee awards in \ncommon fund cases generally range from 20 to 50% of the common fund created);   Manual for \nComplex Litigation, supra, §14.121(attorneys fees awarded in common funds are often between \n25% and 30% of the fund).  \n  10\n\n \n  Some courts refer to 25% of the fund as a “benchmark” award, to be adjusted upwards or \ndownwards based on the circumstances.  See e.g. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 50 F. Supp. 2d at \n1108.  Factors to be considered in adjusting this benchmark include the twelve factors articulated \nin Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), discussed below.  \nSee e.g., Ramah Navajo Chapter, 50 F. Supp. 2d at 1108 (applying Johnson factors); Vizcaino v. \nMicrosoft, 290 F.3d 1043 (9th Cir. 2002) (applying similar factors).  Other courts refer to higher \n“benchmarks.”  See e.g., In re Activision, 723 F. Supp. at 1377 (reviewing numerous cases to \nconclude that “in most recent cases the benchmark award is closer to 30%”).     \n  Regardless of which benchmark or method is used, courts typically approve fee awards at \nthe higher end of the scale in an approximation of typical contingency fees in non-class actions \nof one-third or higher.  See e.g., In re Combustion, Inc., 968 F.Supp. 1116 (W.D.La. 1997) \n(noting that courts have awarded percentages in common fund cases of approximately one-third \ncontingency fee, and awarding fees of $45,952,560, representing 36% of settlement fund);  Shaw \nv. Toshiba America Info. Sys., Inc., 91 F. Supp. 2d 942, 972 (E.D.Tex. 2000) (observing that \nattorneys fees of 25 to 33.33% have been routinely awarded in class actions; citing empirical \nstudies showing that, regardless whether percentage method or lodestar method is used, fee \nawards in class actions average around one-third of recovery); In re Sumitomo Copper Litig., 74 \nF.

Litig., 47 F.3d 373, 379 (9th Cir. 1995) (awarding 33% \nof the common fund as attorneys fees due to the complexity of the issues and the risks);  Cullen \nv. Whitman Medical Corp., 197 F.R.D. 136, 150 (E. D. Pa. 2000) (awarding fees of 33.33%  as \nconsistent with other recent cases awarding the same or more from the common fund); Uselton v. \n  11\n\n \nCommercial Lovelace Motor Freight, Inc., 9 F.3d 849, 853 (10th Cir. 1993) (awarding fees of \n29% of common fund);  In re Ikon Office Solutions, Inc.

Precious Metals Corp., 190 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir. 1999) (adjusting \n30% “benchmark” upward and finding appropriate percentage of the fund to be 33.33%). \n  Federal courts within the Tenth Circuit, including the District of New Mexico, have \nconsistently approved class action fee amounts that are in accord with these percentages:  \n$    In re Boston Chicken, Inc., Sec. Lit., 2006 WL 2338188 (D. Colo. 2006) ($6.5 \nmillion fee, representing 28% of fund); \n   \n$    Millsap v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 2003 WL 21277124 (N.D.

Kan. 1994) ($9.33 million \nfee, representing 33.33% of fund); \n   \n  12\n\n \n$    Cimarron Pipeline Const., Inc., v. Nat’l Council on Compensation Insurance, \n1993 WL 355466 (W.D. Okla. 1993) ($11.77 million fee, representing 33.33% of \nfund); \n \n$    Uselton v. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight, 9 F.3d 849 (10th Cir. 1993) \n($507,500 fee, representing 29% of fund); \n   \n$    In re Public Service Company of New Mexico, 1992 WL 278452 (S.D. Cal. 1992) \n(litigated in part in New Mexico federal court) ($10.5 million fee, representing \n33% of fund).     \n   \n   State Courts in New Mexico, relying on federal precedent, have also consistently \napproved fees in this same range: \n$    In re New Mexico Indirect Purchasers: Microsoft Corporation Antitrust \nLitigation, 2006-NMCA-____ (affirming $6.1 million fee award, representing \n25% of fund); \n   \n$    Dichter v. BP America Production Co., No. D-0101-CV-2000-01620 (Judge \nVigil, First Jud. Dist., 5/12/06) ($7 million fee, representing 24.5% of fund); \n   \n$    Berry v. Federal Kemper Life Ass. Co., No. D-0101-CV-2000-2602 (Judge Hall, \nFirst Jud. Dist., 6/2/06) ($4.77 million fee, representing 25% of fund); \n   \n$    Mareau v. Regents of the University of California, No. SF-96-2430(c) (Judge \nHall, First Jud. Dist., 01/25/02) ($2.66 million fee, representing 25% of fund). \n   \n  C.  Twenty-one percent is consistent with the market rate as \nreflected by the contingent fee agreements negotiated with the \nPlaintiffs \n \n  As the authorities cited above demonstrate, the agreed-upon fee of 20.6% of the common \nfund is at the lowest end of the percentage recoveries routinely approved by federal and state \ncourt judges in New Mexico and across the nation.  See also, Affidavit of Paul Bardacke, filed \nseparately, ¶¶ 12-14.  A 20.6% fee is also well below the 33.33% contingency fee negotiated \nbetween the Plaintiffs and Class Counsel.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 22.  Judge Posner of the Seventh \nCircuit has stated that in awarding attorneys fees to class counsel, courts should attempt to \n  13\n\n \nreplicate the market rate.  Matter of Cont’l Illinois Sec. Litig., 962 F.2d 566, 568 (7th Cir. 1992) \n(in awarding fees, courts should “determine what the lawyer would receive if he were selling his \nservices in the market rather than being paid by court order.”)  Thus if the market rate is a \ncontingent fee percentage of recovery, “class counsel are entitled to the fee they would have \nreceived had they handled a similar suit on a contingent fee basis, with a similar outcome, for a \npaying client.”  Id. at 572;  see also Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 193 (holding that, in setting the \npercentage to be awarded from a common fund, the court may consider the percentage likely to \nhave been negotiated between private parties in a similar case).  Here, the requested fee is \nequivalent to or below the market rate, and it is extremely unlikely that any rational private \nlawyer would have taken this case for less than a one-third contingency fee.  Cf.  Millsap v. \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 2003 WL 21277124, *6 (N.D.Okla. May 28, 2003) (NO. 94-CV-\n633-H(M)) (market rate of one-third set forth in contingency fee agreement informs \ndetermination of reasonable percentage to be awarded from the common fund as attorneys’ fees, \nleading court to determine that 25% of total recovery – or $8.75 million – is a proper and even \nconservative percentage of the fund to be awarded to Class Counsel).    \n  D.  Application of the Johnson factors confirms the reasonableness \nof a twenty-one percent attorneys fee  \n \n  Although the percentage method is now the predominant method used by virtually all \ncourts in common fund cases, courts often verify the reasonableness of the percentage fee \nawarded by analyzing class counsel’s work under the specific factors set forth in Johnson, and \nadopted by the Tenth Circuit in  Brown.  See Brown, 838 F.2d at 454.  The Johnson factors \nenable the trial court to articulate specific reasons for a finding that the percentage fee awarded is \nfair and reasonable.  Uselton, 9 F.3d at 853.  The Johnson factors also enable the court to \n  14\n\n \ndetermine whether any “benchmark” being applied should be adjusted upwards or downwards.  \nRamah Navajo Chapter, 50 F.Supp. 2d at 1108 (applying Johnson factors); Vizcaino, 290 F.3d at \n1048-51 (applying similar factors).   In common fund cases, however, primary consideration is \ngiven to the results obtained.   Brown, 838 F.2d at 456.   \n  The twelve factors evaluated under the Johnson test include: (1) the time and labor \nrequired, (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (3) the skill requisite to \nperform the legal service properly, (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to \nacceptance of the case, (5) the customary fee, (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent, (7) time \nlimitations imposed by the client or the circumstances, (8) the amount involved and the results \nobtained, (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys, (10) the undesirability of the \ncase, (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client, and (12) awards \nin similar cases.  Johnson, 488 F.2d at 717-19. \n  Rarely are all of these factors applicable, and the weight to be given to each factor varies.  \nIn a common fund case, the greatest weight is to be given to the monetary results achieved.  In \nfact, the monetary results may be considered “decisive.”  Brown, 838 F.2d at 456.  The time and \nlabor involved is a “relevant” factor, but should be assigned a lesser weight than the monetary \nresults achieved, risks undertaken, and other factors that “predominate.”  Id. \n  1.  The time and labor required   \n  By the time this litigation is concluded, it will have lasted well over two years.  Class \nCounsel have managed and funded this case for its entirety.  This case required, and continues to \nrequire, a substantial amount of dedicated time and labor.  As of the date of this brief, Class \nCounsel has reasonably expended the following hours on this litigation: \n  15\n\n \nTIMEKEEPER  TOTAL  HOURLY  TOTAL \nHOURS  RATE \nRRR  356  $300.00  $106,800 \nMHD  238  $300.00  $71,400 \nJCB  805  $300.00  $241,500 \nJD  .5  $200.00  $100 \nJLS  21  $200.00  $4,200 \nSJF  25  $200.00  $5,000 \nFTA  70  $200.00  $14,000 \nBJ  24  $100.00  $2,400 \nRAM  137  $100.00  $13,700 \nLES  89  $100.00  $8,900 \nJC  659  $100.00  $65,900 \nJB  8  $75.00  $5,100 \nMB  8  $75.00  $225 \n  2,441  TOTAL  $539,225 \n \n(Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 17.) \n     In addition, Class Counsel continues to commit significant time and labor to the \nadministration of the settlement, for which no additional compensation will be received.  This \nfuture time and labor is likely to be substantial, including legal services to be rendered in \nconnection with the distribution process, and ongoing communications with Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 17.  \n  Also to be taken into consideration is the future time and labor which would have been \nrequired if settlements had not been reached.  See e.g., Torrisi v. Tucson Elec. Power Co., 8 F.3d \n1370, 1376-77 (9th Cir. 1993) (taking into consideration the future time which class counsel \ncommitted to carrying through the conclusion of litigation by trial and appeal).  Otherwise, Class \nCounsel would be penalized for the efficient resolution of these claims by settlement.  See also,   \nManual for Complex Litigation, supra, §14.121 (“one purpose of the percentage method is to \n  16\n\n \nencourage early settlements by not penalizing efficient counsel, thus ensuring that competent \ncounsel continue to be willing to undertake risky, complex and novel litigation”). \n  Class Counsel faced many obstacles and took major risks in handling this litigation on a \ncontingency basis.  To restrict Class Counsel to the hourly rates they customarily charge for non-\ncontingent work, where payment is assured, would deprive them of any financial incentive to \naccept complex contingent fee cases that may produce nothing.  Taking into account the amount \nof time invested in this case to date, the time that will be invested in the future, and the time \nsaved by successfully settling these claims, the requested fee is fair and reasonable. \n  2.  The novelty and difficulty of the questions   \n  By accepting this case, Class Counsel took on issues of law and fact that were complex, \nchallenging, and hotly contested.   Such complex cases require more time and effort on the \nattorneys’ part and the attorneys should be appropriately compensated for accepting the \nchallenge.  Johnson, 488 F.2d at 718.  In the face of these novel and difficult questions of fact \nand law, Class Counsel negotiated settlements on behalf of the Class that provide concrete and \nsubstantial benefits.  Class Counsel’s acceptance of the challenge posed by these issues supports \nthe fees requested. \n  3.  The skill requisite to perform the legal service properly   \n  This case presented a complex, challenging set of factual and legal issues that required \ncounsel with special skills in the difficult areas of large scale class action litigation and civil \nrights law.  Class Counsel are among the few attorneys in this locality with the skills, experience \nand expertise in these areas necessary to succeed in performing these services.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶¶ \n5-7.  For this additional reason, the requested fee is fully justified.  \n  17\n\n \n4.  The preclusion of other employment by the attorneys due to acceptance of the case \n  A review of the number of hours invested in this litigation by Class Counsel demonstrates \nthat other employment was precluded.  The total number of attorney hours invested to date is \nover 1,500 hours.  This equates to a year of full-time legal employment on this one case alone.  \nThe affidavits also establish that other employment was in fact foregone due to the time \nconstraints of this litigation.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 24.   \n  5.  The customary fee    \n  The customary fee in a case such as this (outside the context of a class action) is the \ncontingent fee arrangement wherein counsel receives a percentage – 33.33% in this case – of the \nrecovery, if any, and no fee if there is no recovery.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 21.  In the class action \ncontext, the customary fee is established by the common fund doctrine as discussed above, in the \nrange of 25 - 33.33% (or more) of the recovery.  Thus, the requested fee is well within the \ncustomary fee in a case such as this. \n  6.  Whether the fee is fixed or contingent   \n  Class Counsel undertook significant financial risk in accepting this case on a contingency \nbasis.  The risk undertaken by Class Counsel is second only to the result achieved in assessing \nthe performance of counsel for purposes of the fee award.  As one court stated: \nIn evaluating the services rendered in this case, appropriate \nconsideration must be given to the risks assumed by plaintiffs’ \ncounsel in undertaking the litigation.  The prospects of success \nwere by no means certain at the outset, and indeed, the chances of \nsuccess were highly speculative and problematical. \n \nIn re King Resources Co. Sec. Litig., 420 F.Supp. 610, 636-37 (D.Colo. 1976). \n \n  Class Counsel would be paid absolutely nothing unless the class was successful in \n  18\n\n \nobtaining monetary relief by trial or settlement.  In addition, even if there was a recovery, the \nextent of Class Counsel’s compensation would depend directly on the amount of any monetary \nbenefits obtained. \n  Class Counsel have devoted more than two years to this litigation.  They have invested \nthousands of hours of attorney and staff time and advanced over $100,000 in litigation expenses, \nwithout any compensation.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶¶ 16-20.  Though not required to do so, Class \nCounsel advanced these expenses on behalf of the Class, knowing that in a case such as this the \nexpenses were prohibitive for the Class Representatives.  Class Counsel’s investment has meant \nnot only that they risked non-payment for the years that they devoted to this case and loss of the \nmoney advanced, but they also accepted a significant “lost opportunity cost” from other work \nthat could not be taken because of the demands of this complex case.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 19. \n  In addition, Class Counsel’s investment to date represents only a portion of the total risk \nof non-payment that Class Counsel undertook by accepting the case.  If settlement had not been \nreached, the remaining discovery, motions briefing and hearings, and pre-trial preparation would \nhave consumed many more months and more likely years of additional time devoted exclusively \nto this litigation by Class Counsel.  Trial of this case would have required many months, \ninvolving numerous lawyers, staff support, experts, witnesses, exhibits and demonstrative aids.  \nAll of these future costs are part of the financial risk that Class Counsel assumed when they \nagreed to take this case on a contingency basis. \n  7.  Time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances   \n  The settlement achieved by Class Counsel, if approved, will avoid years of protracted \nlitigation that lay ahead if this settlement had not been reached.  This settlement avoids the \n  19\n\n \nlengthy discovery and pre-trial proceedings yet to be completed.  The settlement avoids the delay \nand uncertain outcome of the trial itself.  Finally, the settlement avoids appeals on the merits that \nmay have been taken following trial.  Class Counsel’s avoidance of these delays in favor of \nprompt cash payments to class members supports the fee award requested. \n  8.  The amount involved and the results obtained   \n  The monetary result obtained is the most important factor in determining the \nreasonableness of class counsel’s fee request.  See Brown, 838 F.2d at 456.  Here, Class Counsel \nobtained significant monetary benefits for the class members.  Unlike many class action \nsettlements that provide little if any actual monetary benefits to the class members, the \nsettlements reached herein provide real and substantial monetary recovery to the class.  The \namounts expected to be allocated to individual class members are equal to or greater than those \nobtained in other such class action suits, and comparable to the awards that have been obtained \nin similar cases through individual lawsuits.  In short, the monetary results obtained for the class \nis substantial and noteworthy, fully supporting the requested fee award.  Bardacke Aff., ¶¶ 11-19. \n   9.  The experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys   \n  This factor is intended to reward counsel for devoting the talent, experience and \nspecialization needed to successfully try a complex class action case.  Johnson, 488 F.2d at 718-\n19.  Here, Class Counsel included attorneys with extensive experience in complex civil litigation, \ncivil rights, and class actions.  (Bienvenu Aff., ¶¶ 4-7; Rothstein Aff., ¶¶ 2-4; Donatelli Aff., ¶¶ \n2-5.  Class Counsel’s dedication of their expertise to this litigation, and the skill required to \nobtain the substantial settlement fund created for class members, supports the  requested fee. \n \n  20\n\n \n  10.  The “undesirability” of the case   \n  This litigation presented difficulties that would make it undesirable to most lawyers.  \nFirst, the MTC Defendants are well-funded and well-insured, enabling them to hire the best \ndefense counsel available, who are then allowed to defend the litigation with no expense spared. \nSecond, the human resources required to properly handle litigation of this magnitude are \nsignificant.  Many firms simply would not be able to keep up with the necessary document and \nwitness investigation and review, wide array of legal research, and the sheer procedural \ncomplexities of such a class action  Third, this litigation required thousands of hours of attorney \nand staff time and more than two years of litigation to date.  Few attorneys are willing to accept a \ndifficult case of this type when it requires foregoing other employment and the lost opportunity \ncost that comes with such lengthy litigation.  Fourth, this case required the out-of-pocket \nexpenditure of over one hundred thousand dollars in litigation expenses.  The case could not \nproceed without advancing these costs, and such costs were essential to the success achieved.  \nFifth, this case could only be pursued on a contingency basis, as the Plaintiffs did not have the \nresources to hire counsel on an hourly fee basis.  Because of the complexity and difficulty of the \nlitigation, any attorney contemplating undertaking this case on a contingency basis faced the \nprospect of no recovery for the money, manpower, and time that would be invested. \n  Class Counsel were willing to accept this case on behalf of the Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the Class notwithstanding these factors.  The undesirability of the case further \nsupports the fee award requested. \n  11.  The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client   \n  This factor is meant to reflect any discounted rate that a lawyer might ordinarily charge to \n  21\n\n \na long-standing client from whom the lawyer might expect continued or repeat business.  \nJohnson, 488 F. 2d at 719.  Here, Class Counsel had no previous relationship with the class or \nthe class representatives.  Thus, no discount should be applied to the requested award.  \n  12.  Awards in similar cases   \n  A review of fee awards in other class action lawsuits establishes that a 20.6% fee is well \nwithin the range of such awards, and in fact is on the low end of such awards.  See, supra, Part \nIII.B.  This final factor therefore also confirms the reasonableness of the requested award. \n  E.  Application of the lodestar method also confirms the \nreasonableness of the percentage fee \n \n   Some courts have used the lodestar/multiplier method instead of the Johnson test as a \n“cross-check” to confirm the reasonableness of a percentage fee award.  See e.g., In re Immunex \nSec. Litig., 864 F.Supp. 142, 142-143 (W.D.Wash. 1994) (lodestar method used as a “cross-\ncheck” in affirming 30% fee award).  Application of the “multiplier” part of the lodestar test \ntypically involves a review of the same factors evaluated under the Johnson test, including the \nresults achieved, the risks undertaken by class counsel, and the skill and quality of the \nrepresentation.  See e.g., Sumitomo, 74 F. Supp. 2d at 398.  In this case, use of the lodestar \nmethod would result in the same fee award as use of the percentage method.   \n  As of the date of this brief, the raw lodestar in this case is $539,225 (not including gross \nreceipts tax).1  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 17.  Thus, a fee of 20.6% of the common fund, or $1,756,098, is \nequivalent to applying a multiplier of 3.26 to the raw lodestar.  This multiplier is well within the \n                                                 \n1  Class Counsel’s billing records will be made available for the Court’s in camera inspection \nupon request.   \n  22\n\n \nrange commonly applied in other class actions, and further establishes the reasonableness of the \nrequested fee.  See, 1 CONTE, ATTORNEY FEE AWARDS § 2.06 at 39 (1993) (multipliers of 5-10 \nare common); 3 NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 14.03 (multipliers ranging from one to four \n“frequently are awarded in common fund cases,” and citing multipliers of five and ten in “large” \ncommon fund cases); In re Miniscribe Corp., 309 F.3d 1234, 1245 (10th Cir. 2002) (approving \nmultiplier of 2.57 as supported in other lodestar multiplier cases); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa \nU.S.A., Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 123 (2nd Cir. 2005) (approving multiplier of 3.5, resulting in a fee of \n$220,290,160.42, and noting that such a multiplier “has been deemed reasonable under \nanalogous circumstances”); Vizcaino, 290 F.3d at 1051 (approving multiplier of 3.65, resulting in \nfee of $27,127,000); Roberts v. Texaco, Inc., 979 F. Supp. 185, 198 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (applying \nmultiplier of 5.5, resulting in fee of $19,154,144.62);  In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust \nLitig., 187 F.R.D. 465, 489 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (“A multiplier of 3.97 is not unreasonable in this \ntype of case”). \n  Federal and state courts in New Mexico have approved similar multipliers; e.g.: \n$    Feerer v. Amoco Production Co., Civ. No. 95-012 JC/WWD (D.N.M. 1998) \n($20.54 million fee, representing multiplier of 4.27); \n   \n$    In re New Mexico Indirect Purchasers: Microsoft Corporation Antitrust \nLitigation, 2006-NMCA-____ (affirming $6.1 million fee award, representing \nmultiplier of 3.0); \n   \n$    Berry v. Federal Kemper Life Ass. Co., No. D-0101-CV-2000-2602 (Judge Hall, \nFirst Jud. Dist., 6/2/06) ($4.77 million fee, representing multiplier of 2.38); \n   \n$    Dichter v. BP America Production Co., No. D-0101-CV-2000-01620 (Judge \nVigil, First Jud. Dist., 5/12/06) ($7 million fee, representing multiplier of 10.17). \n \n  \n  In sum, application of the lodestar method also confirms that a fee representing 20.6% of \n  23\n\n \nthe common fund is fair and reasonable.  See also In re Activision, 723 F.Supp. at 1377 \n(surveying cases and concluding that “nearly all common fund awards range around 30% even \nafter thorough application of either the lodestar or [Johnson] method.”)  \n  F.  Gross receipts tax is properly added to the amount of \nattorneys’ fees under New Mexico law \n \n  New Mexico imposes gross receipts tax on services.  It is customary for gross receipts tax \nto be added to any fee for attorneys’ services rendered, whether on an hourly fee basis or a \ncontingency fee basis.  Accordingly, gross receipts tax of 7.625 % is properly added to the \namount of attorneys’ fees.  See Ramah Navajo Chapter, 50 F. Supp. 2d at 1109 (awarding New \nMexico gross receipts tax on award of fees in class action common fund).   \n  G.  Plaintiffs’ necessary and reasonably incurred litigation expenses are properly \nreimbursed \n \n  It is well-settled that class counsel are entitled to an award of their litigation expenses \nreasonably and necessarily incurred: \nLawyers whose efforts succeed in creating a common fund for the \nbenefit of a class are entitled not only to reasonable fees, but also \nto recover . . . expenses reasonable in amount, that were necessary \nto bring the action to a climax. \n \nNEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS at § 14.03.  To date, Class Counsel and Plaintiffs have incurred \ncosts in the total amount of approximately $110,000, summarized as follows: \nAMOUNT  DESCRIPTION OF COSTS \n$1,535.29  Electronic Research \n$938.36  Long Distance and Conference Calling \n$469.97  Postage and Federal Express \n$4,177.75  Document Reproduction \n$159.00  Facsimiles \n$10,056.52  Court Reporters and Videographers \n  24\n\n \n$1,659.77  Food and Travel \n$4150.00  Filing Fees \n$22,453.76  Mediation \n$28,448.29  Claims Administration/Outreach \n$3,500.00  Expert Witness \n$33,000.00  Outstanding Claims Administration/Outreach \n(estimated) \n$110,548.71  TOTAL     \n \nBienvenu Aff., ¶¶ 19-20.   \n  These costs were reasonably and necessarily incurred in the successful prosecution of this \nlawsuit and are properly reimbursed in full.     \nIV.  THE PROPOSED INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE FAIR AND \nREASONABLE AND SHOULD BE APPROVED \n \nClass representative incentive awards are intended to recognize the significant time and \nefforts expended by the class representatives on behalf of the class and the risks that they \nundertook in bringing a lawsuit.  Ingram v. The Coca Cola Co., 200 F.R.D. 685, 694 (N.D. Ga. \n2001)(awarding incentive awards of $300,000 to each plaintiff and holding that “courts routinely \napprove incentive awards to compensate named plaintiffs for the services they provide and the \nrisks they incurred during the course of the class action litigation” (quoting In re Southern Ohio \nCorrectional Facility, 175 F.R.D. 270, 272 (S.D. Ohio 1997)); see also, Huguley v. Gen. Motors \nCorp., 128 F.R.D. 81, 85 (E.D. Mich. 1989) (“Named plaintiffs and witnesses are entitled to \nmore consideration than class members generally because of the onerous burden of litigation that \nthey have borne.”).  In considering incentive awards, the Court may consider the risk to the class \nrepresentatives, financial and otherwise; the personal difficulties encountered by the class \nrepresentatives; the amount of time and effort spent on litigation; the duration of the litigation; \n  25\n\n \nand the personal benefit—or lack thereof—enjoyed by the class representative as a result of the \nlitigation.  Van Vranken v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 901 F. Supp. 294, 299 (N.D. Cal. 1995).   \n  In the present case, these factors weigh in favor of the agreed-upon incentive awards for \nthe Class Representatives.  They were all willing to allow their names to appear on the \nComplaint, which all parties knew would receive significant publicity.  They made personal \nsacrifices in order to pursue this case on behalf of the Class.  Each of the Class Representatives \nhad particularly strong individual cases that would likely have resulted in significant awards if \nthese cases had been pursued individually.  Instead, the Class Representatives chose to pursue a \nrecovery that, while less beneficial to them, provided a benefit to thousands of others.  Affidavit \nof Elizabeth Leyba, filed separately, ¶¶ 3-11; Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 25; Rothstein Aff., ¶ 7; Donatelli \nAff., ¶ 10.  \n  The Class Representatives were required to submit to depositions and other public \nscrutiny into embarrassing details of their personal lives, including their arrests.  In addition, they \ncollectively spent hundreds of hours reviewing information provided in discovery, providing \ninformation to Class Counsel, participating in depositions, answering written discovery, \nattending mediations, and assisting Class Counsel in countless other ways in the pursuit and \neventual settlement of this case.  Leyba Aff., ¶¶ 3-11; Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 25; Rothstein Aff., ¶ 7; \nDonatelli Aff., ¶ 10.    \nIn sum, given the circumstances presented in this case and the work performed by the \nClass Representatives on behalf of the class, the requested incentive award of $42,750 for each \nClass Representative is reasonable and should be approved. \n \n  26\n\n \n  V.  THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIONS SUPPORTS THE \nREASONABLENESS OF THE AGREED-UPON \nALLOCATION \n \n  Notices of the settlement were sent by first class mail to over 19,000 potential class \nmembers, informing them of the details of the Settlement Agreement, including the proposed \nallocation of attorneys fees, costs and incentive payments.  No class members objected to any \naspect of the Settlement Agreement.  Patton Aff., ¶ 14.  That  no objections were received \nstrongly supports  the reasonableness of the agreed-upon allocation.  In re Linerboard Antitrust \nLitig., 2004 WL 1221350, *5 (E.D.Pa. June 2, 2004) (No. MDL 1261, Civ.A. 98-5055, Civ.A. \n99-1000, Civ.A. 99-1341) (“The absence of objections supports approval of the Fee Petition”) \n(and citing holding of  In re Cell Pathways, Inc., Sec. Litig., II, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18359 \n(E.D.Pa. September 23, 2003) that existence of only one objection shows class does not object to \nthirty percent requested by attorneys and supports approval of fee petition).  Similarly, the fact \nthat not one class member out of the 19,000 to whom notices were given objected to the amount \nof the incentive awards provides further indication that the members of the Class readily \nappreciate the risk and sacrifice undertaken by the Class Representatives.   \n  In addition, the amount of the attorneys fees and incentive payments was the outcome of \nlengthy negotiations with the Defendants, who ultimately must pay these awards.  That the \nparties who bear these expenses do not object further demonstrates that these amounts are fair \nand reasonable. \n         VI.  CONCLUSION  \n  For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court approve the \nParties agreed-upon allocation of attorneys fees, costs and incentive payments. \n  27\n\n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n          Mark H.

This Affidavit is submitted in support of the Joint Unopposed Motion for Final \nI \nApproval of Class Action Settlement Agreement and Approval of Attorneys Fees, Costs and \nInceptive Payments.  The facts set forth herein are true afmy own personal knowledge and I  r \nc \nam competent to testify thereto. \n2.  I am a partner with the law firm of Rothstein, Donatelli, Hughes, Dahlstrom, \nSchoen burg & Bienvenu, LLP and serve as counsel of record for Plaintiffs in this proceeding. \nI am a member in good standing of the State Bar of New Mexico and admitted to practice  ~ \nbefore the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, the United States \ni \n! \nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the United States Supreme Court as well as several  l \nother district courts. \n3.  I received my law degree from Boal! Hall in 1974 and completed advanced \nstudy at the Center for the Study of Law and Society at the University of California.  I have \nbeen licensed to practice law in New Mexico since 1974.  I have served as the chair and a \nmember of the New Mexico Supreme Court Rules of Evidence Committee and as a member \nof the Rules of Civil Procedure Committee.  I have an A V rating from Martindale Hubbell \nand have selected to be included in \"Best Lawyers in America\" in employment law, personal \ninjury and criminal defense. \n4.  My practice consists primarily of civil litigation in the areas of civil rights and \nI \nother complex civil litigation including employment, commercial litigation, antitrust and \nRICO litigation.  In addition to this case, I am counsel of record for the plaintiffs in the  ; \nfollowing class action lawsuits: Garcia, et af. v. Regents oft he University of California, et \n\n6 \n[ \n, \nal., No. CIV-03-1404 WJIRLP (co-lead counsel); Allison v.

The pertinent facts regarding this litigation are set forth in the Affidavit of \n,I'  \n, \nJohn C. Bienvenu and are incorporated hereinto.  My current billing rate for complex civil \nlitigation is $300Ihour.  This is consistent with prevailing rates for persons with similar \nqualifications practicing in this area of the law in this vicinity. \n6.  It is my opinion that the settlement fund established here is a very meaningful \n-\nbenefit to the members of the class, that the change in policies effected by this lawsuit is an \n! \nextremely significant benefit to the community. and that the average class members' chances \n, \n[ \nof obtaining better results by continuing the litigation or by pursuing separate claims would \nbe uncertain at best. \n7.  The named Plaintiffs agreed to assume significant responsibilities when they \nagreed to become Class Representatives.  They understood and agreed that they would be \nultimately responsible for the litigation expenses incurred in this case in the event that there \nt \nwas no recovery.  They also understood and agreed that they would be required to participate  c \nin decision-making regarding this litigation, to attend hearings. to attend depositions, to be \n\nr \n[ \n1 \n, \ndeposed themselves, to respond to interrogatories, requests for production and requests for  I, \n! \nadmission, to attend meetings with Class Counsel, to participate in mediation, and to testify at \n, \ntrial.  They performed all of the duties that were required and their participation was essential  r \nto the successful prosecution of this lawsuit.  They took their duties seriously and acted \nresponsibly.  By agreeing to be named Plaintiffs, they exposed themselves to financial \nliabilities, as well as to public scrutiny and the scrutiny of the Defendants and their attorneys.  , \nI \nThey devoted substantial time and expense in traveling to meetings, depositions. and \nnumerous settlement conferences in Albuquerque.  They were required to, and did, put the \n,\"  \n! \ninterests of the class members ahead of their own self-interest in this matter.

This Affidavit is submitted in support of the Joint Unopposed Motion for Final \nApproval of Class Action Settlement Agreement and Memorandum in Support of Approval of \n\nAttorneys Fees, Costs and Incentive Payments.  The facts set forth herein are true of my own \npersonal knowledge and I am competent to testify thereto. \n2.  I have been licensed in the State of New Mexico since 1976.  I am licensed in \nfederal court in the district of New Mexico, the district of Arizona and in the Tenth Circuit Court \nof Appeals.  I am a New Mexico Board of Legal Specialization recognized specialist in criminal \nlaw.  I have been listed in the Best Lawyers in America since 1989.  I have a Martindale Hubbell \nA V rating.  I am a partner at Rothstein, Donatelli, Hughes, Dahlstrom, Schoenburg & Bienvenu, \nLLP. \n3.  My admission dates to federal courts are:  District of New Mexico May 23, 1983, \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals September 21, 1990 and District of Arizona July 8, 1991.  I \n, \n, \n-\n4.  Since 1983, I have served as counsel for the Plaintiff Class in the New Mexico \nprison conditions lawsuit, Duran v. Johnson.  In addition, I have been counsel of record in dozens \nof civil rights actions against private corrections companies, the State of New Mexico, counties \nand municipalities involving prisons and jails. \n, \n5.  In addition to this case, I am counsel of record for the plaintiffs in the following \n~ \nclass action lawsuits: Lira, et aT. v. Dona Ana County Board o/Commissioners, ef al., No. CIV \n06-0179 WPJIWPL (co-lead counsel) and Rodriguez v. Dona Ana County Boord of \nCommissioners, et 01., No. CIV 06-0416 JHlRHS (co-lead counsel). \n6.  The pertinent facts regarding this litigation are set forth in the Affidavit of John C. \nBienvenu and are incorporated herein by reference.  My current billing rates vary depending on \nthe type of doing; i.e., whether I am representing privately retained criminal defense clients, or \n~ \nI! \ncourt-appointed clients, or representing plaintiffs or defendants in civil litigation matters.  For \n2 \n\ncomplex civil litigation matters on behalf of a private client, my current billing rate is $300 per \n, \nhour.  To my knowledge, this rate is consistent with what other similarly experienced attorneys  r \n! \ncharge in this locality.  In this case. fee agreements were entered into with each of the named \nr \nPlaintiffs, providing we would be entitled to 33 113% of any recovery (plus gross receipts tax), \nl-\nbut would receive no compensation in the event no recovery was obtained.  I \n8.  This case was hard-fought, difficult, and time-consuming, and we devoted \nsubstantial resources to this litigation without any assurance that there would be any recovery at \nall.  The settlement that we were able to obtain with the Defendants represents one of the best \nsettlements that has ever been attained in similar litigation.  It is especially significant to me that \nas a direct result of our efforts, the unconstitutional strip search policies in place at the Santa Fe \nCounty Detention Facility were abolished, and have since been completely revised.  \" \nI \n9.  It is my considered opinion that the settlement fund established here is a very \nmeaningful benefit to the members of the class, that the change in policies effected by this  I \nlawsuit is an extremely significant benefit to the community, and that the average class member's \nchances of obtaining better results by continuing the litigation or by pursuing separate claims \nwould be uncertain at best. \n10.  I am familiar with the dedication and effort put into this case by the Class \nRepresentatives.  They worked tirelessly and selflessly on behalf of the absent class members. \nThey always put the interests of the class ahead of their own interests.  They fully deserve the \nincentive payments that were agreed to by the Defendants. \nt \n3 \n\nFURTHER AFFIANT SA YETH NAUGHT. \nSUBSCRIBED AND SWORN TO before me this~ day of December, 2006, at Santa \nFe, New Mexico. \nMy commission expires: \n, \ni~ \n:: \ni \n, \n, \n, \nt \n, \n4 ",

As grounds for this \nmotion, the Parties state as follows: \nI.  BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY \nOn January 12, 2005, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against the MTC Defendants and the \nSanta Fe County Defendants (the “Action”).  The Action was brought on behalf of the Named \nPlaintiffs and all other persons similarly situated.  Plaintiffs allege that they were unlawfully \nsubjected to strip searches performed pursuant to the policies, practices and customs of \nDefendants of conducting strip searches of all incoming pre-arraignment detainees, without \nindividualized reasonable belief that the detainees possessed weapons, drugs or contraband.  \nIn the Action, Plaintiffs sought damages for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, and for claims arising under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act and New Mexico common \nlaw.  Plaintiffs additionally sought a judgment declaring that Defendants must cease the activities \ndescribed herein and enjoining Defendants from any further strip searches without individualized \nreasonable suspicion.  \nThe Defendants generally deny the claims in the Action.  The MTC Defendants contend \nthat the admissions search policies at the Santa Fe County Adult Detention Center were \nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests in deterring the introduction of weapons, \n \n  −2−\n\ndrugs and other contraband into the detention center.  As such, Defendants submit that detention \ncenter policies are entitled to deference under the law, and that the policies should not be found \nto violate the Constitution or any state law.  Defendants deny that all of the Plaintiffs were \nsubject to strip searches upon admission to the detention center, and they deny that all pre-\narraignment detainees were strip searched during the period of time in question.  Defendants \nfurther deny that searches of the Plaintiffs violated any state or federal statutory or common law. \nThe Santa Fe County Defendants deny any and all liability for their own acts and \nomissions and deny any liability for the acts and omissions by independent contractor MTC and \nMTC’s employees.  The Santa Fe County Defendants contend that Count II fails to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.  In addition, \nDefendant Solano and Defendant Sisneros affirmatively assert that they had no role whatsoever \nin the formulation or implementation of MTC’s strip search policies and have no individual \nresponsibility or liability for any of the allegedly unconstitutional policies, practices or acts of \nthe MTC Defendants, and they also assert qualified immunity as to the violations of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 alleged in the complaint.  In addition, Defendants assert that a class action is inappropriate \nand that the claim for injunctive relief is moot.  \nNonetheless, while denying any liability, the Defendants consider it desirable and in their \ninterests that the Action be dismissed on the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement in order \nto avoid further expense, inconvenience, and distraction, and to avoid protracted litigation. \nAfter extensive discovery and investigation, numerous mediation sessions, and many \nhours of negotiations directly between counsel, the Parties agreed to settle these cases.   On July \n \n  −3−\n\n24, 2006, this Court entered an Order certifying the class, appointing the Class Representatives, \nappointing Class Counsel, and granting preliminary approval of the Parties’ Settlement \nAgreement.  After obtaining the Court’s preliminary approval, the Parties appointed a Claims \nAdministrator who has carried out the claims administration process in accordance with the \nSettlement Agreement and the Court’s July 24, 2006 Order.  With the claims administration \nprocess nearly complete, the Parties now seek the Court’s final approval of their settlement so \nthat the Claims Administrator may distribute the settlement funds to Class members in \naccordance with the Settlement Allocation Plan. \nAt this point, then, the Parties request that the Court enter an Order:  \n1.  Dismissing with prejudice all claim s in the Action as to th e Released \nPersons as defined in the Settlem ent Agreement including all claims \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief; \n \n2.  Ordering  that all Settlem ent  Class  Members  as defined in the \nSettlement Agreement (“SCMs”) are en joined from asserting against \nany Released Person, any and all claim s that the SCMs had, has, or \nmay  have in the f uture  arising  out of   the  facts  alleged  in th e \nComplaint; \n \n3.  Releasing each Released Person from the claims which any SCM has, \nhad or may have in the future, against such Released Perso n arising \nout of the facts alleged in the Complaint; \n \n4.  Determining that the Settlem ent Agreement is entered into in good \nfaith, is reasonable, fair and adequate , and in th e best interest of the \nClass;  \n \n5.  Ordering  that no person m ay  assert  any claim   against the Class \nRepresentatives, Class Counsel, or Claims Administrator based on the \ndistribution of the Settlement Fund made substantially in accordance \nwith the Settlement Agreement and/or the orders of the Court; and \n \n \n  −4−\n\n6.  Reserving the Court’s continuing a nd exclusive jurisdiction over the \nParties to the Settlement Agreement, including Defendants and SCMs, \nto  administer,  supervise, constru e  and enforce the Settlem ent \nAgreement in accordance with its terms for the mutual benefit of all \nthe Parties. \n \nAdditionally, Class Representatives and Cl ass Counsel respectfully request that \nthe Court approve payment forthwith of the attorneys fees, costs and incentive payments \nas set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement.  Defendants do not oppose these requests. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND RELEVANT TO FINAL APPROVAL \nA.  History of This Litigation \nThe Action was filed on January 12, 2005.  Between January 2005 and November 2005, \nthe Parties engaged in extensive discovery, including the exchange of voluminous documents, \ninspection of the detention center facility and depositions of all eleven Named Plaintiffs, \nindividually named Defendants Kerry Dixon and Greg Solano, and other correctional officers \nand officials.  In addition, the Plaintiffs obtained and analyzed the voluminous database \nmaintained by the Defendants for all persons booked into the detention center during the relevant \nclass period (numbering in excess of 31,000 individual bookings).\nIn mid-2005, the Parties agreed to enter into settlement discussions.  The Parties engaged \nin six days of mediation sessions with retired United States District Judge Raul A. Ramirez of \nSacramento, California.  See Affidavit of John C. Bienvenu, filed separately, ¶ 9.  Additionally, \nthe Parties engaged in a number of additional sessions among counsel for the Parties.  Id.  Arms-\nlength settlement negotiations continued through June 2006 when the Settlement Agreement was \nfinally reached.  Id.  \n \n  −5−\n\nB.  The Settlement Terms \nThe terms of the settlement are fully described in the Settlement Agreement, and are \nsummarized as follows.   \n  1.  Monetary Relief to Settlement Class Members \n    a.  Payments to the Settlement Class \nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the MTC Defendants have deposited \nthe sum of $8,000,000 into an interest-earning qualified settlement fund account (“Settlement \nFund”) in compensation for the Settlement Class (as that term is defined in the Settlement \nAgreement), for payment of incentive compensation for each Named Plaintiff, and for Plaintiffs’ \nreasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  In addition, the Santa Fe County Defendants will pay an \nadditional amount up to $500,000 for claims administration expenses.  Thus, the total settlement \nfund created for the benefit of the class (“Total Settlement Fund”) is $8,500,000.     \nThe Claims Administrator will pay out of the Settlement Fund to each Settlement Class \nmember who submits a valid and timely Claim Form a Settlement Payment calculated for that \nSettlement Class member under the proposed Plan of Allocation (attached to the Settlement \nAgreement as Exhibit 4).  Those payments range from a minimum of $2001 to a maximum of \n$3,500.  In the event that the total amount of verified claims exceeds the amount available in the \nSettlement Fund, the amount payable to each Settlement Class member will be reduced \nproportionately.  In the event that the total amount of verified claims is less than the amount \navailable in the Settlement Fund, the balance will be refunded to the Defendants. \nAs of November 29, 2006, approximately 3,402 individuals had filed Claim Forms.  See \n                                                 \n1 In the Parties’ motion for preliminary approval, the minimum amount was incorrectly stated as $1,000.  That is the \ncorrect minimum base amount, but several factors (relating to previous incarceration) can result in an 80% reduction \nof the base amount, thus making the minimum possible payment equal to $200. \n  6\n\nAffidavit of Mark Patton, filed separately, ¶ 13.  Class members had until November 27, 2006 to \nsubmit Claim Forms.  Assuming that several hundred additional Class members submitted timely \nClaim Forms and are entitled to payment from the Settlement Fund, it is estimated by Class \nCounsel that the total amount of claims to be paid is more than $4,000,000 but somewhat less \nthan the amount of $5,529,750 allocated for payment of claims.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 26. \n    b.  Incentive Payments \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, the Parties have agreed that the Class Representatives \nare eligible to receive compensation for their contribution to the investigation and prosecution of \nthis case, in addition to the amounts to which they are entitled under the Plan of Allocation.  The \nParties have agreed that $470,250 of the Settlement Fund will be allocated for this purpose, \nsubject to approval of the Court, representing $42,750 per Class Representative.     \n    c.  Equitable Relief \n  The Parties have stipulated and agreed that the strip search policies at the Santa Fe \nCounty Detention Center were changed as a result of Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ counsel’s efforts \npreceding and during this lawsuit, and that the request for equitable relief was thereby rendered \nmoot.  \n    d.  Attorneys’ Fees and Costs \nThe Parties have stipulated and agreed that $2,000,000 of the Settlement Fund will be \nallocated to Plaintiffs’ attorneys fees, gross receipts tax on fees, and litigation expenses, subject \nto approval of the Court.    \n   e.  Release of Claims \nAll Plaintiffs and Settlement Class members who do not opt out of the settlement will \nrelease the Defendants from any and all claims which are based upon or could be based upon or \n  7\n\narise from the facts alleged in the Action.   \nC.  Class Notice and Settlement Administration\nOn July 24, 2006, this Court granted the Partie s’ Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval \nof Class Action Settlement Agreement.  In that Order, the Court (1) pr eliminarily approved the \nSettlement Agreement; (2) certified the Class  under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23; (3) appointed Nam ed \nPlaintiffs Elizabeth Leyba, Natasha Apodaca, Nancy Ellin, Monica Garcia, Lucy M. Marquez, \nMark  Miller, Copper P erry,  David  Sandoval, Kristi Seibold, Ru ssella  Serna, and Kim berly \nWright as Class Representatives; (4) appointed Mark H. Donatelli, Robert R. Rothstein and John \nC. Bienvenu of Rothstein, Donatelli, Hughes,  Dahlstrom, Schoenburg, & Bienvenu, LLP as \nClass Counsel; (5) approved the form and manner of the Notice to be sent to Class Members and \na Summary Notice to be published in various newspapers concerning the Settlement Agreement; \n(6) approved the forms of, and set deadlines fo r submission of, claim forms, exclusion requests \n(“opt outs”) and objections; and (7) set for December 8, 2006 a hearing for final approval of the \nsettlement.   \nThe Settlement Agreement preliminarily approved by the Court provided for a detailed \nNotice  Package to be se nt  to all Class m embers  informing  them  of their rights under the \nSettlement  Agreement,  for a Summary Not ice  to  be published in local newspapers, for \nadvertisements to be placed on local radio statio ns, and for notices to be  posted at the Santa Fe \nCounty Detention Center.  Counsel for the Parties  retained Settlement Services, Inc. (“SSI”) as \nClaims Administrator to carry out the duties  of mailing the Notice Package and publishing the \nSummary Notice in the newspapers .  The Defendants provided SSI  with a database containing \nthe names and last known addresses for all poten tial Class members.  After receipt of the \ndatabase from the Defendants, SSI began the notice and claims administration process.   \n  8\n\nIn accordance with the Settlement Agreement and the Court’s July 24, 2006 Order, the \nClaims Administrator mailed the Court-approved Notice Package to over 19,000 potential class \nmembers.  Patton Aff., ¶ 7.  SSI also cause d to be published the Court-approved Summ ary \nNotice as directed in the Court’s order of preliminary approval, and placed announcements on \nnumerous radio stations, in both English and Spanish.   Id. at ¶¶ 8, 9.    Furthermore, SSI created \nan interactive website to provide infor mation to and answer questions from  potential Class \nMembers, and further provided a toll  free number to call with questions.   Id. at ¶¶ 5, 6.  Class  \nCounsel also fielded thousands of calls from and to Class Members and answered their questions \nabout the terms of the settlement.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 26.   \nTo  date,  more than 3, 400  individuals  have  submitted  Claim  Forms  to SSI; th ree \nindividuals have filed Opt-Out Forms; and no  individuals have submitted Objections to the \nsettlement.  Patton Aff., ¶¶ 13, 14.  As noted  above, the deadline for filing Claim  Forms was \nNovember 27, 2006, a nd the Parties anticipate th at SSI will receive additional Claim  Forms \nsubmitted prior to that deadline.   \nIII. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT FINAL APPROVAL OF THE \nSETTLEMENT \n   \nA.  Adequate Notice Has Been Provided to the Class and the Terms of the    \n  Settlement are Fair, Reasonable and Adequate \n \n  Settlement of a class action requires the Cour t’s approval.  Rule 23(e) (“A class action \nshall not be dism issed or compromised without the approval of the co urt, and notice of the \nproposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such a manner as \nthe court directs”).  The law generally favor s the settlement of complex class actions.   Entr. \nEnergy Corp. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 137 F.R.D. 240, 242 n.1 (S.D. Ohio 1991); \nsee also 4A Conte & Newberg,  Newberg on Class Actions, §11.41 (4th ed. 2002).   The Court \n  9\n\nshould approve a class action settle ment if the settlem ent is “fair, reasonable and adequate.”   \nRule 23(e)(1)(C); In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig. , 443 F. Supp. 2d 1249, 1256 (D. Kan. 2006).   \nSee also Bailey v. Great Lakes Canning, Inc. , 908 F.2d 38, 42 (6 th Cir. 1990); Jones v. Nuclear \nPharmacy, Inc., 741 F.2d 322, 324 (10 th Cir. 1984);  In re Rio Hair N aturalizer Prods. Liab. \nLitig., No. MDL 1055, 1996 WL 780512, at *11 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 20, 1996) (citing Manual for \nComplex Litigation, §30.42 (3d ed. 1995)). The Court’s main concern in evaluating a class action \nsettlement is to ensure  that the rights of  passive class members are not jeopardized by the \nproposed settlement.  In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig.,  443 F. Supp. 2d at 1255 ( citing Amchem \nProds., Inc. v. Winsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997)). \n  There are three steps on the road to final a pproval of a class action settlem ent: first, the \nCourt must preliminarily approve the proposed settlement; second, members of the class must be \ngiven proper notice of the proposed settlement; and third, after holding a hearing, the Court must \ngive its final approval to the settlement.  Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 921 (6th Cir. 1983); \nEnter. Energy Corp., 137 F.R.D. at 245; In re  Dun & Bradstreet Credit Servs. Customer Litig. , \n130  F.R.D. 366, 369 (S.D. Ohio 1990).  T he  Court  granted prelim inary  approval of the \nsettlement in its July 24, 2006 Orde r.  Thus, the Court must at this point determine whether the \nParties provided proper notice  of the settlement to the C lass and whether the term s of the \nsettlement are fair, reasonable and adequate. \n   1.  Proper Notice Has Been Provided to the Class    \n“[I]n any proceeding [that] is to be accorded finality,” due process requires that interested \nparties be provided with “notice reasonably calc ulated, under… the circum stances, to apprise \n[them] of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.”  \nMullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co ., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).  The notice m ust be \n  10\n\nreasonably calculated to reach interested par ties and where the nam es and addresses of the \ninterested parties are known, due process requires mailed notices.  Id. at 318-19; Dejulius v. New \nEngland Health Care Employee Pension Fund , 429 F.3d 935 (10 th Cir. 2005)  The  contents of \nthe class notice must ‘“fairly apprise the . . . m embers of the class of the term s of the proposed \nsettlement and of the options that are open to  them in connection with [the] proceedings. ”’  \nMaywalt v. Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co. , 67 F.3d 1072, 1079 (2d Cir. 1995) ( quoting \nWeinberger v. Kendrick, 698 F.2d 61, 70 (2d Cir. 1982)).  Class notice is sufficient if it “may be \nunderstood by the average… class member.”  Hitt v. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (In re Nissan Motor \nCorp. Antitrust Litig.), 552 F.2d 1088, 1104 (5th Cir. 1997); see also Churchill Village L.L.C. v. \nGen. Elec., 361 F.3d 566, 575 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Notice is satisfactory if it generally describes the \nterms of the settlement in sufficient detail to alert those with adverse  viewpoints to investigate \nand to come forward and be heard”) (internal quotation marks & citation omitted). \nHere, the Notice and S ummary Notice and th eir method of dissemination meet these \nrequirements.  The Notice and Summary Notice clearly and concisely informed Class members \nof all the relevant aspects of the litigation: (1) the Class definition and  statement of claims; (2) \nthe litigation history; (3) the terms of the Settlement Agreement; (4) how the settlement proceeds \nwill be allocated; (5) the am ount of compensation requested for the Class Representatives to \ncompensate them for their services to the Cla ss; (6) the am ount of attorneys’ fees and costs \nwhich may be awarded to Class Counsel; (7) th e binding effect of any judgment approving the \nsettlement on those who do not opt out; (8) the right to object to the Settlement and the procedure \nfor doing so; and (9) whom to contact to obtain additional information regarding the Settlement \nor the litigation.  The notices pr ovide all the information necessary for Class members to make \n  11\n\nan informed decision with respect to whether to remain in or opt out of the Class or whether to \nobject to the proposed settlement.   \n  The method of providing notice to potential  Class members also complies with the \nrequirements of due process.  The Claim s Administrator mailed the Court-approved Notice \nPackage to over 19,000 potential class m embers.  Patton Aff., ¶ 7.  The  Claims Administrator \nalso caused the Summary Notice to be published  in several newspapers, som e with local and \nsome with statewide circulation, and placed announcements in local radio stations.  Patton Aff., \n¶¶ 8, 9.  The Claims Administrator further created an interactive website to provide information \nto and answer questions of potential Class Members, and provided a toll free number to call with \nquestions.  Id. at ¶¶ 5, 6.  Class Counsel also fielde d thousands of calls from  and to Class \nMembers and answered their questions about the terms of the settlement.  Bienvenu Aff., ¶ 26. \n  In summary, the Court should hold that th e notice requirements of Rule 23 and the due \nprocess clause have been met in the present case. \n   2.  The Settlement is Fair, Reasonable and Adequate \n  The Tenth Circuit has established four non- exclusive factors which this Court must \nconsider  in  evaluating  whether th e  Parties’ s ettlement  in this cas e  is fair, reas onable  and \nadequate:  (a) whether the propos ed settlement was fairly and honestly negotiated; (b) whether \nserious questions of law and fact exist, placing the ultimate outcome of the litigation in doubt; (c) \nwhether the value of an immediate recovery outweighs the mere possibility of future relief after \nprotracted and expensive litigation; and (d) the judgment of the parties that the settlement is fair \nand reasonable.  Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 1180, 1188 (10th Cir. 2002) \n(internal quotation marks & citation omitted); In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig.,  443 F. Supp. 2d \n  12\n\n1249, 1256 (D. Kan. 2006).2\n  In considering whether to grant final appr oval, the Court cannot  modify the proposed \nsettlement, but must approve or disapprove the proposed settlement “as a whole” in relation to all \nof those concerned.  See Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 727 (1986);  Walsh v. Great At. & Pac. \nTea Co., Inc., 726 F.2d 956, 965 (3d Cir. 1983);  In re Rio Hair Naturalizer Prods. Liab. Litig., \n1996 WL 780516 *11 (“The touchstone for final approval is the effect on the class as a whole in \nlight of the particular circumstances.”(emphasis omitted)).  The Court e xamines the settlement \n“in  its entirety and not as   isolated com ponents.”    Enter.  Energy C orp.  v. Columbia Gas \nTransmission Corp., 137 F.R.D at 246.  Also, the Court is  not “to determine the merits of the \ncontroversy  or the factual underpinning of the  legal  authorities advanced by the parties.” \nWilliams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 921.  See also Armstrong v. Bd. of Sh. Dirs., 616 F.2d 305, \n314-15 (7th Cir. 1980), overruled on other grounds by Felzen v. Andreas , 134 F.3d 873 (7th Cir. \n1998).   To do so would defeat the purposes of   the settlem ent,  which include avoiding a \ndetermination of sharply contested issues and dispensing with expensive and wasteful litigation.  \nLevin v. Miss. River Corp., 59 F.R.D. 353 (S.D.N.Y. 1973),  aff’d mem., 486 F.2d 1398 (2d Cir. \n1973).   \n  Examination of the Tenth Circuit’s factors confirms that the settlement in the present case \nis fair, reasonable and adequate. \n   a.  The Proposed Settlement was Fairly and Honestly Negotiated \n \n  The first factor the Court must consider is whether the proposed settlement was fairly and \n                                                 \n2 Courts in other circuits utilize similar factors, such as (1) the Plaintiffs’ likelihood of ultimate success on the \nmerits balanced against the amount and form of relief offered in settlement; (2) the complexity, expense and likely \nduration of the litigation; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the judgment \nof experienced trial counsel; (5) the nature of the negotiations; (6)the objections raised by the class members; and \n(7) the public interest.  See Enter. Energy Corp., 137 F.R.D. at 245; In re Dun & Bradstreet Credit Litig., 130 \nF.R.D. 366, 371 (citing Williams, 720 F.2d at 922); Thompson v. Midwest Found. Indep. Physicians Ass’n, 124 \nF.R.D. 154, 157 (S.D. Ohio 1988). \n  13\n\nhonestly negotiated.  Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co. , 314 F.3d 1180, 1188 10 th Cir. \n2002); In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig.,  443 F. Supp. 2d 1249, 1256 (D. Kan. 2006).  In \nevaluating  the propriety of a pr oposed  settlement,  courts ha ve  frequently focused on the \nnegotiating process by which the settlement was reached to determine whether that process was \ngenuinely adversarial.  See e.g., Weinberger v. Kendrick , 698 F.2d 61, 74 (2d Cir. 1982),  cert. \ndenied, 464 U.S. 818 (1983).   \n  In  the present case, settlem ent  negotiations  were only undertaken   after the Parties \nengaged in extensive discovery and voluntary disclosure of all relevant background information.  \nThe Parties exchanged all relevant documents including training materials, written policies, jail \nrecords, and the voluminous computer files for all bookings during the class period.  In addition, \nthe Defendants deposed each of the nam ed Plaintiffs, and the Plaintiffs deposed the warden and \nformer warden, the jail monitor, the county sheri ff, and correctional and tr aining officers.  The \nParties had sufficiently developed  the facts in the action to  fully analyze the pro and cons of \nsettlement.  See Levell v. Monsanto  Research Corp., 191 F.R.D. 543, 550 (S.D. Ohio 2000); \nCollier v. Montgomery County Hous. Auth. , 192 F.R.D. 176, 184 (E.D. Pa. 2000);  Bryant v. \nUniversal Servs., No. CIV. A. 99-2944, 2000 WL 680258 at 3 (E.D. La. May 24, 2000);  In re \nHolocaust Victim Assets Litig., 105 F. Supp. 2d 139, 146 (E.D.N.Y. 2000).  \n  Settlement  negotiations  were leng thy,  involved,  and complex.  Multip le  separate \nmediation sessions were facilitated by retired United States District Judge Raul Ramirez, who \nhas special expertise in the m ediation of class action suits involving allegedly unco nstitutional \nstrip search polices and practices.  In addition, th e Parties participated in numerous unmediated \nmeetings  between counsel, and m any  telephone  conversations and email exchanges am ong \ncounsel.   T he  settlement  negotiations  lasted m any  months,  were  adversarial in  nature, and \n  14\n\ninvolved numerous parties with varying interest s.  Settlement negotiations were hard-fought, \narms-length, and contentious at times.    Clearly, the settlement negotiations were adversarial in \nnature.  See In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig.,  443 F. Supp. 2d at 1260 (finding that settlem ent \nnegotiations,  although conducted at  an  early stage of  litigation,  were fa ir  and honest, thus \nsupporting final approval).  The first factor weighs in favor of final approval. \n     b.  Serious Questions of Law and Fact Place the Ultimate    \n        Outcome in Doubt \n \n  The second factor the Court m ust consider is whether serious questions of law and fact \nplace the ultimate outcome of this case in doubt.  Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 \nF.3d 1180, 1188 (10th Cir. 2002); In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig., 443 F. Supp. 2d 1249, 1260-61 \n(D. Kan. 2006).  W hile Plaintiffs firmly believe they have meritorious claims on the m erits, \nPlaintiffs also acknowledge that all complex cases such as this one confront numerous hurdles on \ntheir way to a success ful outcome in the case.   First and foremost, Plaintiffs always face a \nsignificant burden in obtaining cla ss certification.  Second, if class  certification is denied or \nlimited, Plaintiffs would be faced with pros ecuting scores of individual cases.  Th e time and \nresources required to prosecute more than a handful of individual cases would be immense.  On \nthe other hand, if class certification is obtaine d, there still rem ains the difficulty burden of \nproving  class-wide liability, and  the  possibility that individual  damage  cases must still b e \nbrought.  Again, such serious questions of law and fact would have placed the ultimate outcome \nof the action in doubt.  See In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig., 443 F. Supp. 2d at 1260-61 (finding \nthat serious questions of law and fact regarding plaintiffs’ claims placed the ultimate outcome in \ndoubt and weighed in favor of final approval).  This factor also weighs in favor of final approval. \n \n \n  15\n\n   c.  The Value of Immediate Recovery Outweighs the Mere   \n   Possibility  of  Future Relief After Protracted and Expensive  \n   Litigation \n \n  The third factor to be considered by the Court is the value of i mmediate recovery under \nthe proposed settlement versus the mere possibility of future relief after protracted and expensive \nlitigation.  Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 1130, 1188 (10th Cir. 2002); In re \nSprint Corp. ERISA Litig., 443 F. Supp. 2d 1249, 1261 (D. Kan. 2006)  There can be no doubt \nwhatsoever that if the Parties had not reached an agreement to settle the action, litigation in this \ncase would have been exceedingly difficult, expensive and lengthy.   After the Court ruled on the \ndifficult class certification issues, the Parties would have p roceeded to additional discovery on \nthe merits, which they anticipate would have lasted several years at least.  Due to the complexity \nof the issues, the large am ount of money at stake, and the num ber of attorneys and experts \ninvolved in these cases, trem endous resources would have been  expended trying these cases, \neither collectively or individually.  And as noted above, the ultim ate outcome of this case was \nuncertain due to disputed questions of law and fact. \n  By settling this case and providing $8.5 million for the benefit of the Class members, all \nParties have averted many of the risks of pro ceeding with litigation.  Each Class m ember who \nfiles  a valid claim   is enti tled  to receive a m inimum  of $200 and a m aximum  of $3,500 \n(depending on a number of individualized factors, including the time period in which the search \ntook place, whether the Class member had been previously incarcerated, and whether individual \nexacerbating factors were present).  Thus, the settlement provides a meaningful financial benefit \nto Class members. \n  In addition, as a direct result of Plain tiffs’ and Class Counsel’s efforts precedin g and \nduring this lawsuit, the strip  search policies at the Santa Fe  County Detention Center were \n  16\n\nchanged.  Plaintiffs’ request for inju nctive relief was thereby rendered moot because Plaintiffs’ \naims were achieved.  \n  Of course, resolution of th e action provides a benefit to  the Defendants as well.  It \nremoves the risk of a significant ju ry award against the Defendants, and operates to reduce the \ncontinued accrual of attorneys’ fees and costs on all sides.  Resolution of the action will save the \nParties and the Court a trem endous amount of time and money, while  providing meaningful \nbenefit to the Class.  This factor also weighs in favor of final approval.  In re Sprint Corp. ERISA \nLitig., 443 F. Supp. 2d at 1261 (uncertainty o f result and certainty of additional expense to  \nlitigate claims weighs heavily in favor of approval); see also Levell v. Monsanto Research Corp., \n191 F.R.D. 543, 550 (S.D. Ohio 2000);  Collier v. Montgomery Housing Auth., 192 F.R.D. 176, \n184 (E.D. Pa. 2000); Bryant v. Universal Servs., 2000 WL 680258, at *3 (E.D. La. 2000);  In re \nHolocaust Victim Assets Litig., 105 F. Supp.2d at 146. \n   d.  The Parties and Their Counsel  Believe the Settlement Is Fair  \n   and  Reasonable \n \n  The fourth factor the Court must consider is whether the Parties and their counsel believe \nthe settlement is fair and reasonable.   Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 1180, \n1188 (10th Cir. 2002); In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig., 443 F. Supp. 2d 1249, 1261-62 (D. Kan. \n2006).  First and foremost, the Class Representatives believe this settlement is in the best interest \nof  the Class.   See  Affidavit of E lizabeth  Leyba, file d  separately, ¶¶ 9-12.  These Class  \nRepresentatives  have been intim ately  involved  in the action from the beginning through \nsettlement.  They firmly believe that, given the m eaningful benefits provided by the settlement \nand the risks associated with continued litigation, the settlement is fair and reasonable.  Id. \n  Counsel for the Parties hold the same belief.  All of the Parties’ attorneys are experienced \ntrial attorneys.  It is  the collective judgm ent of counsel for the Parties  that settlement of the \n  17\n\naction in accordance with the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable and \npreferable to continued litigation.  The Court “s hould keep in mind the unique ability of class \nand defense counsel to assess poten tial risks and rewards of litigation [and] a presum ption of \nfairness, adequacy and reasonableness may attach to a class settlement reached in arm’s-length \nnegotiations between experienced, capable  counsel after meaningful discovery.”  See Cotton v. \nHinton, 559 F.2d. 1326, 1330 (5 th Cir. 1977).  Som e courts even hold that the Court should \n“defer to the judgment of experienced counsel who has competently evaluated the strength of his \nproofs.”   See Levell v. Monsanto research C orp.,  191 F.R.D. 543, 557 (S.D. Ohio 2000); \nWilliams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 922 (6th Cir. 1983).  This factor also weighs in favor of final \napproval.  In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig.,  443 F. Supp. 2d at 1261 (opinion of the parties’ \ncounsel supports final approval of class action settlement). \n  For all these reasons, the Court should hold that the Parties provided proper notice of the \nsettlement  to the Class   and that the term s  of the Parties ’  Settlement  Agreement  are f air, \nreasonable and adequate. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Request for Attorneys’ Fees, Costs and Incentive Payments is Fair \nand Reasonable and Should be Approved \n \nThe Parties have agreed that $2,000,000 of the Settlement Fund will be allocated to \nPlaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, gross receipts tax on fees, and litigation expenses, subject to approval \nof the Court.  In addition, the Parties have agreed that the Class Representatives are eligible to \nreceive compensation for their contribution to the investigation and prosecution of this case, in \naddition to the amounts to which they are entitled under the Plan of Allocation.  The Parties have \nagreed that $470,250 of the Settlement Fund will be allocated for this purpose, subject to \napproval of the Court, representing $42,750 per Class Representative.     \n  18\n\nAs fully set forth in Plaintiffs’  Memorandum in Support of Approval of Reasonable \nAttorneys Fees, Costs and Incentive Payments, filed separately, these payments are fair, \nreasonable, supported by law, and should be approved. \nC.  The Absence of Any Objections Supports Final Approval \n \n  Class members were fully informed of all aspects of the proposed settlem ent, including \nthe amount of the settlem ent fund, the allocation form ula, the amount to be requested for \nattorneys’ fees and costs, and the amount to be  requested for incentive paym ents to the Class \nRepresentatives.  Class members were provided with an opportunity to object to the terms of the \nsettlement.  Not one objection was received by any Class members.  Patton Aff., ¶ 14. \n  The fact that no class mem ber has objected to the settlement is a strong indication of a \nsettlement’s fairness.  Newberg, §11.48.  In the present case, it  is revealing that, despite the \nissuance  of  the Notice Package to m ore  than 19,000 potential Class m embers,  none filed \nobjections to the settlem ent.  By c ontrast, more than 3,400 individuals have submitted Claim \nForms without objection to date, and  three individuals have chosen to opt out of the settlem ent.   \nSee Stoetzner v. U.S. Steel Corp. , 897 F.2d 115, 188-19 (3d Cir. 1990)  (objections of 29 class \nmembers out of a settlement class of 281 (over ten percent) “strongly favors settlement); Boyd v. \nBechtel Corp., 485 F.Supp. 610, 624 (N.D. Cal. 1979) (o bjections from 16% of class was \n“persuasive” that settlement was adequate).    The Parties submit that, given the absence of any \nobjections in the present case, the Court should grant final approve the settlement. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Parties respectfully request that the Court issue its Order:  \n1.  Dismissing with prejudice all claims in th e Action as to the Released  Persons as \ndefined  in the Settlem ent  Agreement  including  all claim s  for declaratory an d \ninjunctive relief; \n \n  19\n\n2.  Ordering that all Settlement Class Members as defined in the Settlement Agreement \n(“SCMs”)  are enjoined from   asserting against  any Released Person, any and all \nclaims that the SCMs had, has, or m ay have in the f uture arising out of the facts \nalleged in the Complaint; \n \n3.  Releasing each Released Person fr om the claims which any SCM has, had or may \nhave in the future, against such Released Person arising out of the facts alleged in the \nComplaint; \n \n4.  Determining  that the Settlem ent  Agreement  is entered into in go od  faith,  is \nreasonable, fair and adequate, and in the best interest of the Class;  \n \n5.  Ordering that no person may assert any claim against the Class Representatives, Class \nCounsel, or Claims Administrator based on  the distribution of the Settlem ent Fund \nmade substantially in accordance with the Settlement Agreement and/or the orders of \nthe Court; and \n \n6.  Reserving the Court’s continuing and exclus ive jurisdiction over the Parties to the \nSettlement Agreement, including Defendants and SCMs, to adm inister, supervise, \nconstrue and enforce the Settlement Agreement in accordance with its terms for the \nmutual benefit of all the Parties. \n \nAdditionally, Class Representatives and Cl ass Counsel respectfully request that \nthe Court approve payment forthwith of the attorneys fees, costs and incentive payments \nas set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement.  Defendants do not oppose these requests. \n      Respectf ully submitted, \nROTHSTEIN, DONATELLI, HUGHES,  \nDAHLSTROM, SCHOENBURG & BIENVENU, LLP \nMark H. Donatelli \nRobert R. Rothstein \nJohn C.

BIENVENU, being fIrst duly sworn upon his oath, deposes and states as \nfollows: \nI.  This Affidavit is submitted in support of the Joint Unopposed Motion for Final \nApproval of Class Action Settlement Agreement and Memorandum in Support of Approval of \n\n~ \n, \n\" \nAttorneys Fees, Costs and Incentive Payments.  The facts set forth herein are true afmy own \npersonal knowledge and I am competent to testify thereto.  , \nI \n2.  I am a graduate of Stanford Law School, having received a J.D. degree (\"With \nDistinction\") from that institution on June 12, 1988.  I was an honors student at the University of \nr \n, \nCalifornia at Berkeley from 1975 to 1978.  I received a B.A. degree (summa cum laude) from the \nUniversity of New Mexico in 1985. \n3.  I am a member in good standing of the State Bar of New Mexico and the State Bar \nof California (inactive status).  I am admitted to practice before the United States District Court  I \nfor the District of New Mexico, the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, the United States Court of  I: \n,\"  \nAppeal for the Ninth Circuit, the United States Court of Appeal for the Tenth Circuit, and the \nf \nUnited States Court of Federal Claims. \nI \n, \nI \n4.  From 1988 to 1990, I practiced civil litigation with the law firm of Brobeck,  , \nPhieger & Harrison in San Francisco and Palo Alto, California; from 1990 to 1993, I practiced \ncivil litigation with the law finn of Rothstein, Donatelli, Hughes, Dahlstrom, Cron & Schoenburg \nin Santa Fe, New Mexico; from 1993 to 2003, I practiced civil litigation in my own law office; \nand since 2004, I have been a partner with the law firm of Rothstein, Donatelli, Hughes, \nDahlstrom, Schoenburg & Bienvenu, LLP. \n5.  My practice consists exclusively of civil litigation.  My practice is primarily in the \narea of civil rights litigation, and I have experience in other complex civil litigation including \ncommercial litigation, antitrust, RICO, and patent and copyright litigation.  I have tried numerous  t \ncases to both judges and juries in state and federal court.  I completed a two week course in trial  ; \n2 \n\nr, \nf \n, \n, \nadvocacy at the National Institute of Trial Advocacy in Boulder, Colorado in 1991.  I have \nlectured on trial advocacy at the Intersession Trial Practice Course at the University of New \nMexico School of Law.  I have been retained as an expert witness to provide testimony on the \nstandard of care in civil rights litigation.  I am rated A-V by Martindale-Hubbell. \n6.  In addition to this case, I am counsel of record for the plaintiffs in the following \nclass action lawsuits: Garcia, el at. v. Regents a/the University a/California, et aI., No. CIV-03-\n1404 WJIRLP (co-lead counsel); Kelley, et af. v. Regents oft he University a/California, et 01., \nNo. SF 96-2430 (co-lead counsel); In re Dewen Federal Bank FSB Mortgage Servicing \n~ \nLitigation, MDL No. 1604 (counsel for the New Mexico class);  Lira, et af. v. Dona Ana County \neIV \nBoard ofC  ommissioners, et al., No.  06-0179 WP JIWPL (co-lead counsel); Rodriguez v. \nI \nDona Ana County Board o/Commissioners, et aI., No. eN 06-0416 JHlRHS (co-lead counsel).  L \n7.  The other attorneys in this law firm working on this case are highly experienced in \nthe areas of civil rights litigation and complex civil litigation, including class actions.  Robert R. \nRothstein is one of the premier civil rights practitioners in the COWltry and has also served as lead \n~ \ncounsel for the plaintiffs in a number of class actions.  Mark H. Donatelli also has extensive \n, \nexperience in complex civil litigation of this type and has litigated class action lawsuits.  Mr.  \" \nl:. \n, \nDonatelli and Me. Rothstein are also very experienced in the areas of criminal law and are widely \nacknowledged for their expertise in correctional law. \n8.  We began working on this litigation in November, 2004.  Discovery in this case \nwas extensive.  We obtained and reviewed all relevant documents from the Defendants in \ndiscovery. in addition to computer records of some thirty thousand detainees.  We developed a \ncomprehensive computer database for the information obtained through discovery that allowed \n3 \n\nus to keep track of the large volume ofinfonnation.  We consulted with third party witnesses and \nexperts and retained expert witnesses and consultants to assist in the gathering of information and \nthe analysis of the infonnation received.  All of the named Plaintiffs were deposed by the \nDefendants, and the Plaintiffs deposed the named Defendants and many other important \nwitnesses.  The extensive discovery completed provided a finn and comprehensive basis of \nknowledge of the relevant facts and issues on which the settlements were based. \n9.  The settlements were reached following extensive mediation efforts assisted by a \nvery experienced and reputable mediator, retired United States District Judge Raul A. Ramirez. \nThese settlement negotiations began in September of 2005 and continued for many more months \nwith numerous meetings of the parties and their counsel, including six days of mediation with \nl \nJudge Ramirez.  The settlement negotiations were vigorous, intense, and hotly-contested.  Even \nafter reaching agreements in principle, it took the parties many more months of intensive \nnegotiations to agree on the myriad details of the settlements and the fonn of the settlement \ndocuments.  The final settlement was reached only after extensive arms-length negotiations, and \ni \nI \nthese negotiations were in good faith. \n10.  The amount of attorneys fees was not negotiated until after agreement was \nreached on payments to the class.  The settlement was intentionally structured to ensure that the \npayment of attorneys fees and costs would not come out of the recovery to the class members, \nbut instead would be paid by the Defendants.  The amount of attorneys fees was therefore subject \nto intensive, adversarial negotiation with the Defendants. \n, \nII.  In addition to monetary relief, as a direct result of Plaintiffs' and Class Counsel's \nefforts, the unconstitutional strip search policies in place at the Santa Fe County Detention \n4 \n\nFacility were abolished, and have since been completely revised. \n12.  While extensive discovery was undertaken before the settlements were reached,  '\" \nsubstantial additional discovery remained.  We anticipated taking and defending numerous  I \nadditional depositions, including expert depositions.  Identification of trial witnesses and exhibits \nr \nremained to be done.  Due to the breadth of the allegations and the number of individual  rc  \n, \nclaimants, all parties anticipated a lengthy trial.  Regardless of the outcome at trial, all parties \nanticipated appeals of the resulting judgments.  Thus, future recovery, if any, to the class \nmembers through trial, was years away. \n13.  It is my considered opinion that the settlement fund established here is a very \nmeaningful benefit to the members of the class, that the change in policies effected by this \nI \nlawsuit is an extremely significant benefit to the community, and that the average class member's \nchances of obtaining better results by continuing the litigation or by pursuing separate claims \nwould be uncertain at best. \n14.  For thirty years, our law firm has been involved in hundreds of civil rights cases. \nl \nBased on my involvement in civil rights and employment cases and other complex litigation, I  ! \nam very familiar with and knowledgeable about contemporary market rates for attorneys in New \nMexico practicing in these areas.  I have reviewed and studied numerous affidavits in support of  I \nfee applications as well as decisions of the federal and state courts awarding fees in this \njurisdiction.  My own customary hourly rate for civil litigation matters has been $275 for the past \ntwo years, and was recently increased to the current rate of $300 per hour, plus gross receipts tax. \nI \nOther partners in this law fum have the same or higher customary hourly rate for civil litigation \nmatters (other than in the special practice of Indian law in which lower hourly rates have \n5 \n\nhistorically prevailed). \n15.  I began working on this litigation in November, 2004.  I have maintained \ncontemporaneous records of all time spent on this case in increments of one-tenth of an hour (six \nminutes).  The other attorneys and staff working on this case have also maintained \nr \ncontemporaneous records of their time.  I have reviewed these time records and can attest that \nthese hours were reasonably and necessarily devoted to the prosecution of this lawsuit. \n16.  The hours spent by each timekeeper on this case through November 27, 2006 is as \nfollows: \nTIMEKEEPER  TOTAL  HOURLY  TOTAL \nHOURS  RATE \n'56 \nRRR  $300.00  $106,800  I \n, \nMHD  238  $)00.00  $11,400  \" \nSO,  ! \nJCB  $300.00  $241,500 \n., \nJD  $200.00  $100 \nJLS  21  $200.00  $4,200 \nSl'  2S  $200,00  55,000 \nFTA  70  S200.00  $14,000 \nI \nBJ  24  S100.00  $2,400 \nRAM  137  $100.00  $13,700 \nLES  89  $100.00  $8,900  , \n.59 \nJC  $100.00  565,900 \nJB  8  $75.00  $5,100 \nMB  8  $75.00  \"\" \n2,441  TOTAL  SS39,2ZS \n17.  We are continuing to devote substantial attorney and staff time to this litigation \nwith respect to obtaining fmal approval of the settlement agreement, communications with Class \nMembers, and the claims detennination process.  I anticipate that hundreds of hours of additional \n6 \n\nattorney and staff time will be devoted to such work through the first halfof2007. No additional \n, \n, \ncompensation will be sought or received for such future work. \n\" \n18.  This law finn has advanced a total of$77,548.71 in litigation expenses in this  ~ \nlawsuit through November 22, 2006.  These expenses include expert witness fees, mediation  , \n[ \nexpenses, expenses for consultants and private investigators, computer database access charges, \ndocument reproduction, long distance charges, telefax charges, deposition expenses, travel \nexpenses, and miscellaneous litigation expenses.  Each of these expenses is documented and \nitemized.  In addition, this law firm has incurred additional expenses for claims administration \n~ \nand outreach efforts that have not yet been billed or paid, which I have estimated at $33,000.  All \nof these expenses were reasonably and necessarily incurred in the prosecution of this litigation. \nI \ni: \n\" \n19.  A summary of these expenses is as follows: \nAMOUNT  DESCRIPTION OF COSTS \n51,535.29  Electronic Research \n$938.36  Long Distance and Conferencc Calling \n$469.97  Postage and Federal Express \ni \n, \n$4,177.75  Document Reproduction  ! \n5159.00  Facsimiles \n$10,05652  Court Reporters and Vide.ographers \n, \nSI,659.77  Food and Travel \n$4150.00  Filing Fees \n$22,453.76  Mediation \nS28,448,29  Claims Administration/Outreach \nS3,500.00  Expert Witness \n$33,000.00  Outstanding Claims Administration/Outreach \n(estimated) \nSII0,548.71  TOTAL  I \n20.  Additional out of pocket expenses continue to be incurred in connection with this \nI' \n7 \n\n~ \n,I'  \nlitigation and the claims determination process.  No further reimbursement will be sought or \nobtained for these additional out of pocket expenses. \n21.  My customary fee arrangement for a contingency case is one-third of the recovery, \nplus gross receipts tax and out-of-pocket expenses.  I am familiar with the customary fee \narrangements in Santa Fe and New Mexico for contingency cases, which are for one-third or \nmore of the recovery, plus gross receipts tax and out-of-pocket expenses. \n22.  Fee Agreements were entered into between Class Counsel and each of the named \nr \nPlaintiffs in this case.  Those Fee Agreements provided that Class Counsel would represent the \n, \nPlaintiffs on a contingency basis whereby Class Counsel would be entitled to 33 113% of any \nrecovery (Plus gross receipts tax), but would receive no compensation in the event no recovery \nwas obtained. \nr \n23.  I am familiar with hourly rates in Santa Fe and New Mexico for complex civil  I \np \nlitigation.  For partners, such rates range from $250 to $375.  My current hourly rate for a case of \nthis type, if! were to make an hourly rate arrangement, would be $300 per hour plus gross \ni \nreceipts tax.  However, I would not take a case of this type on a contingency basis unless I \n, \nexpected to receive significantly more than that hourly rate to compensate for the uncertainty of  t \npayment and the delay in payment. \n24.  This case has required a significant percentage of my time over the past several \nyears and I have turned down other cases in order to ensure that I had sufficient time to devote to \nthis matter. \n25.  Named Plaintiffs Elizabeth Leyba, Natasha Apodaca, Nancy Ellin, Monica \nt \nr \nGarcia, Lucy M. Marquez, Mark Miller, Copper Perry, David Sandoval, Kristi Seibold, Russella \n8 \n\nSerna, and Kimberly Wright agreed to assume significant responsibilities when they agreed to \nbecome Class Representatives.  These named Plaintiffs understood and agreed that they would be \nultimately responsible for the litigation expenses incurred in this case in the event that there was \nno recovery.  They also understood and agreed that they would be required to participate in \ndecision-making regarding this litigation, to attend hearings, to attend depositions, to be deposed \nthemselves, to respond to interrogatories, requests for production and requests for admission, to \nattend meetings with Class Counsel, to participate in mediation, and to testify at trial.  They \nperformed all of the duties that were required and their participation was essential to the \nsuccessful prosecution of this lawsuit.  I would estimate that each of these named Plaintiffs has \ndevoted a minimum of one hundred hours to their duties, and some of them substantially more. \nThey took their duties seriously and acted responsibly.  By agreeing to be named Plaintiffs, they \nexposed themselves to financial liabilities, as well as to public scrutiny and the scrutiny of the \nDefendants and their attorneys.  They each devoted substantial time and expense in traveling to \nmeetings, depositions, and settlement conferences in Santa Fe and Albuquerque.  They were \n! \nrequired to, and did, put the interests of the class members ahead of their own self-interest in this \nmatter.  It is my firm belief that they are entitled to the additional incentive awards set forth in \n, \nthe proposed settlement agreement, and as agreed to by the Defendants. \n26.  In addition to the notice provided by the Claims Administrator, we separately \nundertook extensive outreach efforts in an effort to locate potential Class Members and inform \nthem of the settlement and the procedure for filing claims.  We developed a database to track \ncontacts with all potential Class Members.  We hired staff dedicated to making telephone and in-\nt \nc \nperson contacts with potential Class Members.  We mailed thousands of additional notice \n9 \n\npackages and claim fonns to potential Class Members.  We published additional advertisements \nin various newspapers, and placed additional radio advertisements in a number of radio stations \nin Santa Fe and Rio Arriba Counties.  We invested many hundreds of hours in staff time and \napproximately $60,000 in these outreach efforts.  I believe that these efforts directly resulted in \ndoubling or tripling the number of Claim Forms received. \n27.  As of November 30, 2006, 3,481 individuals have filed Claim Forms.  No Class \nMembers have objected to the settlement.  Three individuals have opted out of the settlement. . \nClaim Forms will be considered timely if they are postmarked no later than November 27, 2006. \nAssuming that several hWldred additional timely and valid Claim Forms will be received. I \nestimate that the total amoWlt of claims to be paid will be well over $4.000,000, but somewhat \nless than the amount allocated for payment of claims ($5,529,750). \n, \nFURTHER AFFIANT SAY  ETH NAUGHT. \nC. BIENVENU \nthis~ \nSUBSCRIEED AND SWORN TO before me  day of November, 2006, at Santa \nFe, New Mexico. \nMy commission expires: \n, \n10 ",
