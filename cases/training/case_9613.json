    "summary": "<p>On March 7, 2006, seven individuals that had been arrested on minor offenses filed a class action civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, challenging the strip search policy of the Dona Ana County Jail. Plaintiffs alleged that the Dona Ana County Sheriff had a blanket policy of strip searching all pre-arraignment detainees upon their arrival at the Jail, regardless of the offense charged, or whether their was any suspicion that the detainee possessed weapons or contraband. The plaintiffs, who were strip searched pursuant to this policy, alleged that that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as state tort law. Plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. The Dona Ana County Sheriff generally denied the allegations.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after the suit was filed, the District Court (District Judge William P. Johnson) stayed the proceedings at the request of the parties so that they could pursue settlement negotiations. Ultimately, a settlement agreement was reached. After the initial settlement agreement, Judge Johnson entered an agreed order consolidating the case with a similar case styled <a href=\"../../../../case/10255/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rodriguez v. Dona Ana County</a>, which contested strip searches at the County juvenile detention facility. The parties then filed an Amended Stipulation of Settlement, under which the Defendants agreed to pay $5.3 million to resolve all class claims. The stipulated Adult Settlement Class included all detainees who were strip searched between March 7, 2003, and March 7, 2006, at the Dona Ana County Jail prior to arraignment. The stipulated Juvenile Settlement class included all detainees who were strip searched between May 16, 2003, and May 16, 2006, at the Dona Ana Juvenile Detention Center. It was estimated that there were approximately 11,000 class members. Individual claims were to be paid per an agreed-upon distribution formula, with the range of expected pay-outs per individual claimant was estimated at $1,200 to $2,400. Representative plaintiffs would receive a total $200,000 or $25,000 per class representative. $1,666,667 of the settlement fund was allocated for attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Johnson preliminarily approved the settlement on December 20, 2007.</p>\r\n<p>On May 20, 2008, the district court (Judge Johnson) issued a final approval of the settlement and a final judgment of dismissal in the case. A few years later, on April 8, 2011, the parties filed a joint motion to approve settlement distribution, which the court granted the next day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiffs allege that these strip searches \nwere performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offenses for which Plaintiffs had been \nI \narrested, and without Defendants having a reasonable belief that the Plaintiffs possessed weapons \nor contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable belief that the search would  , \n~ \nproduce contraband or weapons. \nPlaintiffs sought damages for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.c. § 1983, and for \nclaims arising under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.  Plaintiffs additionally sought a judgment \ndeclaring that Defendants must cease the activities described herein and enjoining Defendants \n2 \n\nfrom any further strip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion.  Plaintiffs brought \nthis action on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals. \nDefendants contend that not all incoming pre-arraignment detainees were subjected to \nstrip searches.

A copy of the Settlement Agreement is\nattached hereto as Exhibit A.  Specifically, the Parties request the Court to enter an Order, in the\nform attached hereto as Exhibit B:  (1) preliminarily approving the Settlement Agreement; (2)\nconditionally certifying the Class; (3) appointing Named Plaintiffs as Class Representatives; (4)\nappointing counsel for the Named Plaintiffs as Class Counsel; (5) approving the form and\nmanner of the Notice to be sent to Class Members and a Summary Notice to be published in\nvarious newspapers concerning the Settlement Agreement;1 (6) approving the forms of, and\nsetting deadlines for submission of, claim forms, exclusion requests (“opt outs”) and objections;2\nand (7) setting a date for a final fairness hearing.\nThis motion will explain the circumstances and terms of the settlement, and the legal\ngrounds supporting its preliminary approval.\nI.  INTRODUCTION\nA. The Action\nOn March 7, 2006, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all persons similarly situated,\nfiled a complaint in the above-captioned matter (the “Action”) in which they challenged certain\n1   A Copy of the proposed Notice is attached as Exhibit 2 to the Settlement Agreement.\n2   A Copy of the Claim Form is attached as Exhibit 1 to the Settlement Agreement.\n2\n\npractices of Defendants including the strip search of certain detainees, and sought damages and\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs allege that they were each unlawfully subjected to a\nstrip search performed pursuant to the policies, practices and customs of Defendants of\nconducting strip searches of all incoming pre-arraignment detainees.  Plaintiffs allege that these\nstrip searches were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offenses for which\nPlaintiffs had been arrested, and without Defendants having a reasonable belief that the Plaintiffs\npossessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable belief that\nthe search would produce contraband or weapons. \nPlaintiffs sought damages for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and for\nclaims arising under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.  Plaintiffs additionally sought a judgment\ndeclaring that Defendants must cease the activities described herein and enjoining Defendants\nfrom any further strip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion.  Plaintiffs brought\nthis action on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals.\nDefendants contend that not all incoming pre-arraignment detainees were subjected to\nstrip searches.  Defendants further contend that the admissions search policies at the DACDC\nwere and are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests in deterring the introduction of\nweapons, drugs and other contraband into the detention center.  Defendants submit that the\ndetention center policies are entitled to deference under the law, and that the policies should not\nbe found to violate the Constitution or any state law.  Defendants further deny that the searches\nof Plaintiffs violated any state or federal law.\n3\n\nNonetheless, while denying any liability, the Defendants consider it desirable and in their\ninterests that the Action be dismissed on the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement in order\nto avoid further expense, inconvenience, and distraction, and to avoid protracted litigation.\nBy entering into the Settlement Agreement and taking actions pursuant to it, the Parties\ndo not concede that any particular allegations, claims or defenses in the Action have merit. \nAccordingly, while Defendants join in this motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement\nAgreement and request that the Court enter the accompanying Order, this motion does not\nconstitute an admission of any liability or of the propriety of class action treatment of this\nlitigation in the event that the Court does not preliminarily or finally approve the Settlement or if\nsuch approval is overturned on appeal.  In the event that final approval is not obtained and the\nSettlement Agreement does not become effective, nothing in this motion or the accompanying\nsettlement pleadings may be used for any purpose in further litigation of the claims of the Named\nPlaintiffs or of any of the putative Class Members that they seek to represent.  Similarly, even if\nthe Settlement Agreement is finally approved and becomes effective, none of the assertions made\nin this motion or in any of the accompanying settlement pleadings constitutes or should be\ndeemed an admission by any of the Defendants in any litigation commenced by any putative class\nmember who opts out of the Settlement or by any person who does not meet the criteria for\ninclusion in the Class.\nB. Summary of the Settlement Terms\nAfter exchanging discovery, the Parties entered into the arms-length settlement\nnegotiations that culminated in the Settlement Agreement.  Under the Settlement Agreement, the\n4\n\nParties have stipulated that the Action should be certified as a class action under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23. \nThe Parties agree that the Defendants will pay $5 million (the “Settlement Fund”) in\ncompensation for the Settlement Class (as that term is defined in the Settlement Agreement), for\npayment of incentive compensation for each Named Plaintiff, and for Plaintiffs’ reasonable\nattorneys’ fees and costs.  The settlement will constitute a full and complete adjudication of the\nclaims, rights and obligations of the Parties and the Class with respect to the matters alleged in\nthe Action and as further set forth in the Settlement Agreement.  The Parties believe that they\nhave crafted a fair, reasonable and adequate settlement of the claims at issue in this case, and one\nthat warrants the Court’s preliminary approval.\nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND RELEVANT TO PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\nA. History of This Litigation\nThe Action was filed on March 7, 2006.  The Parties entered into the voluntary exchange\nof all relevant information pertaining to the claims raised herein, including extensive review of\nthousands of individual booking records.  On May 14 and 15, 2007, the Parties engaged in two\ndays of mediation sessions with experienced mediator Nancy Lesser, and, following mediation,\ncontinued negotiations until the attached Settlement Agreement was finally reached.  In addition,\nthe Plaintiffs obtained and analyzed the voluminous database maintained by the Defendants for\nall persons booked into the DACDC during the relevant class period (numbering in excess of\n36,000 individual bookings).  See Affidavit of Attorney John C. Bienvenu, filed separately.\nB. The Settlement Terms\nThe terms of the settlement are fully described in the Settlement Agreement, and are\n5\n\nsummarized as follows.  \n1. Certification of the Class\nThe Settlement Class is defined in the Settlement Agreement as all persons arrested on a\nnon-VDW Offense3 who were strip searched between March 7, 2003 and March 7, 2006 at\nDACDC prior to arraignment.  The Parties estimate that there are approximately 11,000\nSettlement Class members.  See Bienvenu Affidavit.  The Parties agree that the Action should be\nconditionally certified as a class action under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.\n  2.  Monetary Relief to Settlement Class Members\na. Payments to the Settlement Class\nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Defendants will deposit a Settlement Fund of\n$5,000,000 into an interest-earning qualified settlement fund account within thirty days of the\ndate of preliminary approval.  The Claims Administrator will pay out of the Settlement Fund to\neach Settlement Class member who submits a valid and timely Claim Form a Settlement\nPayment calculated for that Settlement Class member under the proposed Plan of Allocation\n(attached to the Settlement Agreement as Exhibit 3).  At this time, depending on how many\nSettlement Class members actually file claims, the range of expected pay-outs per individual\nclaimants is estimated at $1,200 to $2,400.  See Bienvenu Affidavit.\nb. Incentive Payments\nUnder the Settlement Agreement, the Class Representatives will be eligible to receive\ncompensation for their contribution to the investigation and prosecution of this case, in addition\n3 A “Non-VDW Offense” is defined as an offense not involving drugs, weapons or violence as identified in Exhibit 4\nto the Settlement Agreement.\n6\n\nto the amounts to which they are entitled under the Plan of Allocation.  The Parties have agreed\nthat $175,000 of the Settlement Fund will be allocated for this purpose, subject to approval of the\nCourt, representing $25,000 per Class Representative.    \nc. Equitable Relief\nThe Parties have stipulated and agreed that the strip search policies at the DCADC were\nchanged as a result of Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ counsel’s efforts preceding and during this\nlawsuit, and that the request for equitable relief was thereby rendered moot. \nd. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs\nThe Parties have stipulated and agreed that $1,666,667 of the Settlement Fund will be\nallocated to Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, gross receipts tax on fees, and litigation expenses, subject\nto approval of the Court.   \ne. Release of Claims\nAll Plaintiffs and Settlement Class members who do not opt out of the settlement will\nrelease the Defendants from any and all claims which are based upon or could be based upon or\narise from the facts alleged in the Action.  \nf. Notice and Opt-Out Procedures\nThe Settlement Agreement provides for a detailed Notice to be sent by mail to all\nSettlement Class members informing them (in English and Spanish) of their rights under the\nSettlement Agreement, and for a summary Notice (in English and Spanish) to be published in\nlocal newspapers informing Settlement Class members of the settlement and directing them to\nsources of additional information.  In addition, announcements summarizing the settlement are to\n7\n\nbe made in English and Spanish on three local radio stations.\nThe Settlement Agreement provides that Settlement Class members have two options for\nresponding to the Notice.  A Settlement Class member may (1) remain a Settlement Class\nmember and be eligible to submit a Claim Form, or (2) request exclusion from the Settlement\nClass and opt out.  Settlement Class members who request exclusion from the Settlement Class\nand opt out will not be deemed to have released the Defendants from any claims and may pursue\nany claims they may have against the Defendants, but will not receive any payments from the\nSettlement Fund.  Settlement Class members who do nothing will be deemed to have released\ntheir claims, but will not receive any payments from the Settlement Fund.  Settlement Class\nmembers who submit Claim Forms will be eligible to receive payments from the Settlement\nFund as determined under the Plan of Allocation.\nSettlement Class members who do not opt-out may also present objections to the Court at\nthe final fairness hearing.\nIII.  ARGUMENT\nA. The Settlement Agreement Merits Preliminary Approval\nPreliminary approval of a proposed settlement is part of a two-step process required\nbefore a class action can be settled.  See Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth (hereinafter\n“Manual”) § 21.632 (Fed. Jud. Ctr. 2004).  In considering preliminary approval, courts make a\npreliminary evaluation of the fairness of the settlement.  “Where the proposed settlement appears\nto be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations, has no obvious deficiencies,\ndoes not improperly grant preferential treatment to class representatives or segments of the class\n8\n\nand falls within the range of possible approval, preliminary approval is granted.”  In re NASDAQ\nMarket-Makers Antitrust Litig., 176 F.R.D. 99, 102 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); see also Manual § 21.632. \n“Once preliminary approval is bestowed, the second step of the process ensues: notice is given to\nthe class members [of the terms of the proposed settlement and of a hearing] at which class\nmembers and the settling parties may be heard with respect to final court approval.”  NASDAQ, \n176 F.R.D. at 102; Manual at §§ 21.633-34.  \nIn considering whether to grant a motion for preliminary approval of a proposed\nsettlement agreement, the Court utilizes a “threshold inquiry” intended merely to reveal\nconspicuous defects.  See In re Inter-Op Hip Prosthesis Liability Litig., 204 F.R.D. 330, 337-38\n(N.D. Ohio 2001).  Ultimately, of course, before a settlement can be finally approved, the Court\nmust determine that a settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  See Jones v. Nuclear\nPharmacy, Inc., 741 F.2d 322, 324 (10th Cir. 1984).  At the preliminary approval stage, however,\nthe Court should evaluate, based on the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the contents of the\nrecord, and the controlling legal authority whether “the proposed settlement is sufficiently\nreasonable, adequate, fair, and consistent with the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 to warrant\nnotice… to the class members and a fairness hearing.”  See Marcus v. Kan., Dep’t of Revenue,\n206 F.R.D. 509, 513 (D. Kan. 2002).    \nConsidering the issues, evidence, and nature of the settlement negotiations, preliminary\napproval is appropriate in this case.  First, the proposed settlement is the product of serious,\ninformed, non-collusive negotiations.  The settlement negotiations lasted many months, were\nadversarial in nature, and involved numerous parties with varying interests.  The Parties engaged\n9\n\nin mediation with the assistance of a highly experienced mediator, Nancy Lesser on May 14 and\nMay 15, 2007, and then continued negotiations amongst counsel through August 2006.  See\nBienvenu Affidavit.  Thus, the course of settlement negotiations rises well above the threshold\nfor preliminary approval.\nSecond, the terms of the Settlement Agreement are fair, reasonable, and adequate to\nresolve the dispute.  Liability was hotly contested.  Both sides developed evidence to support\ntheir claims and defenses.  Plaintiffs believe their class would have been certified.  Defendants\nare equally convinced they would have defeated class certification and would have been allowed\nto defend the claims on an individual basis.  All Parties predicted protracted litigation.  Most\ncourts, in considering approval of a class action settlement, note the advantages of avoiding\nlengthy and expensive litigation.  See, e.g., Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268,\n1276 (9th Cir. 1992)(recognizing “the strong judicial policy that favors settlements, particularly\nwhere complex class action litigation is concerned”); Wald v. Wolfson (In re United States Oil\nand Gas Litig.), 967 F.2d 489, 493 (11th Cir. 1992) (“Complex litigation . . . can occupy a\ncourt’s docket for years on end, depleting the resources of the parties and the taxpayers while\nrendering meaningful relief increasingly elusive”).  The Parties here recognized the advantages of\nsettlement over continued litigation.\nThe Settlement Fund established here is a meaningful benefit to Settlement Class\nmembers.  Plaintiffs’ counsel, who are experienced in this type of litigation, believe the Class\nmembers’ chances of obtaining better results by continuing the litigation or by pursuing separate\nclaims are uncertain at best.  See Bienvenu Affidavit.  See also Duhaime v. John Hancock Mut.\n10\n\nLife Ins. Co., 177 F.R.D. 54, 69 (D. Mass. 1997) (approving settlement agreement and noting that\nsettlement “provides class members with timely relief without having to risk the uncertainty of\noutcome, duration, and expense inherent in continuing the litigation”).\nFinally, the Settlement Agreement does not grant unduly preferential treatment of class\nrepresentatives or segments of the class.  NASDAQ,  176 F.R.D. at 102.  In this instance, through\nnon-collusive negotiation, the Parties have agreed that the Settlement Agreement should include\nincentive awards to the Class Representatives.  The Plaintiffs submit that the proposed incentive\nawards are reasonable and are intended to recognize the significant time and efforts expended by\nthe Class Representatives on behalf of the Class and the risks that they undertook in bringing the\nlawsuit.  Ingram v. The Coca Cola Co., 200 F.R.D. 685, 694 (N.D. Ga. 2001)(“‘Courts routinely\napprove incentive awards to compensate named plaintiffs for the services they provide and the\nrisks they incurred during the course of the class action litigation’” (quoting In re Southern Ohio\nCorrectional Facility, 175 F.R.D. 270, 272 (S.D. Ohio 1997)).  The Class Representatives\ncontributed substantial time and energy in support of the action, including extensive participation\nin discovery, case strategy, case management, and mediation.  Van Vranken v. Atlantic Richfield\nCo., 901 F. Supp. 294, 299 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (in considering an incentive award, the court may\nconsider the risk to the class representatives, both financial and otherwise; the personal\ndifficulties encountered by the class representatives; the amount of time and effort spent on\nlitigation; the duration of the litigation; and the personal benefit—or lack thereof—enjoyed by\nthe class representative as a result of the litigation).  Given their contributions throughout the\nlitigation, these individual payments are reasonable and not excessive.  Cf. Ingram, 200 F.R.D. at\n11\n\n694 (approving $300,000 incentive award to each named plaintiff); see also, Bienvenu Aff.,\n(payments of $42,500 per named plaintiff approved by United States District Judge Bruce Black\nin Leyba, et al. v. Santa Fe County Board of Commissioners, et al., No. CIV 05-0036 BB/ACT). \nThe Defendants have agreed to neither oppose nor support the amounts proposed to be paid to\nthe Class Representatives as an incentive.\nB. The Court Should Appoint Class Representatives and Class Counsel and \nConditionally Certify the Class \nThe instant case, which alleges that the Defendants’ practices affected a large group of\nindividual detainees at the DCADC, is exactly the sort of dispute that Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 is\ndesigned to remedy.  For that reason, the Parties urge the Court to appoint Class Representatives\nand Class Counsel, and to conditionally certify the Class under Rule 23.  Courts have regularly\ncertified classes of a similar nature.  See e.g. Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004)\n(upholding certification of class of arrestees challenging counties’ alleged policies of conducting\nroutine strip searches of all pre-arraignment detainees); Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis., 219\nF.R.D. 607 (W.D. Wis. 2003) (certifying class of persons strip searched at county jail); Mack v.\nSuffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000) (certifying class of pre-arraignment female\ndetainees challenging county’s policy of routine subjecting female pre-arraignment detainees to\nstrip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion).  Because Plaintiffs meet all the\ntechnical requirements of Rule 23, and because it is fair and efficient to resolve all the claims\ntogether, the Court should conditionally certify the Class in this case.\n12\n\n1. The Court Should Appoint the Class Representatives and Class Counsel\nThis Motion seeks appointment of Named Plaintiffs Jesus Lira, Ben Garcia, Graciela\nMartinez, Stephen Culler, Cynthia Archer, Frederick Garcia and Douglas Beidler as Class\nRepresentatives.  All of these Named Plaintiffs are appropriate Class Representatives because\nthey were subject to the same policies and practices that allegedly violated the rights of the Class\nmembers.  Furthermore, all of these Plaintiffs have acted in the best interest of the Class and\nnone of these Plaintiffs has a conflict of interest which would preclude him or her from serving\nas a representative of the Class.  \nThis Motion also seeks appointment of Robert R. Rothstein, John C. Bienvenu and Mark\nH. Donatelli of Rothstein, Donatelli, Hughes, Dahlstrom, Schoenburg & Bienvenu, LLP, and\nMichael W. Lilley and Marc A. Lilley, Lilley Law Offices, as Class Counsel.   These lawyers are\nexperienced in the areas of civil rights law and class action litigation, and none has any conflict\nof interest which would preclude him from serving as Class Counsel.  All of these lawyers have\nbeen involved in the litigation from the time the lawsuit was filed, and all participated in the\nnegotiations that led to the Settlement Agreement.  \n2. The Proposed Settlement Class Meets the Requirements of Rule 23(a)\nA class must have the following prerequisites in order to be certified under Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 23(a):  “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are\nquestions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative\nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  See Lopez v. City of Santa Fe, 206\n13\n\nF.R.D. 285, 288 (D.N.M. 2002)(certifying settlement class); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  Here the\nproposed Class clearly satisfies all of the Rule 23(a) requirements.\na. The Class Is So Numerous that Joinder Is Impracticable\nThe Settlement Class in this case is estimated to include approximately 11,000\nindividuals.  See Bienvenu Affidavit.   Joinder of so many individual members would be\nimpracticable, and accordingly this Court should find that the numerosity requirement of Rule\n23(a) is satisfied in this case.  See 1 H. Newberg & A. Conte, Newberg on Class Actions §3:5, at\n246 (4th. ed. 2002)(in most cases where class size numbers in the hundreds, numerosity is not an\nissue).\nb. There Are Questions of Law and Fact Common to the Class\nThe commonality requirement is met if plaintiffs’ grievances share a common question of\nlaw or fact.  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 288.  “Commonality requires only a single issue common to\nthe class, and the fact that the claims of individual class members may differ factually should not\npreclude certification under Rule 23(b)(2) of a claim seeking the application of a common\npolicy.”  Id. at 289 (internal quotations marks & citations omitted); see also Adamson v. Bowen,\n855 F.2d 668, 676 (10th Cir. 1988).\nThe claims on behalf of the Class before the Court share numerous common questions of\nfact and law.  Most importantly, the case is dominated by the factual and legal questions of\nwhether the Defendants’ policies and procedures with respect to strip searches of pre-arraignment\ndetainees violated the rights of the Settlement Class members.  Resolving these questions would\ndepend in large part upon evidence that would apply to the Settlement Class as a whole.  Thus,\n14\n\nthe Rule 23(a)(2) commonality requirement is satisfied.\nc. Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Typical of the Settlement Class and\nThere Are No Conflicts\nThe proposed Class Representatives present claims that are typical of those of the\nSettlement Class.  “A… plaintiff's claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or\ncourse of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and if his or her claims are\nbased on the same legal theory.”  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 289 (internal quotation marks & citations\nomitted); see also In re American Medical Systems, Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1082 (6th Cir. 1996)\n(citing Newberg on Class Actions §3.13, at 3-76 (3d. ed. 1992)). \nIn this case, each of the proposed Class Representatives claims that he or she was strip\nsearched in violation of his or her rights.  See Compl. ¶¶ 18-42.  These claims are also brought on\nbehalf of the Settlement Class.  See Compl. ¶¶ 44-53.  The  Complaint alleges that the Named\nPlaintiffs’ claims arise out of the same events, practices and course of conduct that give rise to\nthe class-wide injury at issue.  See Compl. at ¶¶ 44-53.  As such, it is manifest that the typicality\nrequirement is met. \nd. The Class Representatives Have Fairly and Adequately \nProtected the Interests of the Settlement Class\nThe purpose of the adequacy of representation requirement is to “protect the legal rights\nof absent class members.”  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 289 (internal quotation marks & citation\nomitted); see also Kirkpatrick v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 827 F.2d 718, 721 (11th Cir. 1987).  “In\norder to adequately represent the class, two requirements must be met: (1) the class\nrepresentative must not have interests antagonistic to those of the class, and (2) the attorneys\n15\n\nrepresenting the class must be qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed\nlitigation.”  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 289-9; see also Retired Chicago Police Ass’n v. City of\nChicago, 7 F.3d 584, 598 (7th Cir. 1993); Cross v. Nat’l Trust Life Ins. Co., 553 F.2d 1026, 1031\n(6th Cir. 1977).\nThe first requirement, an absence of any conflicts between the Class Representatives and\nthe Settlement Class, is satisfied because both the Class Representatives and the Settlement Class\nmembers allege they have been harmed by the Defendants’ allegedly unlawful practices. \nBecause all Class Representatives and the Settlement Class Members have allegedly suffered\nharm as a result of the Defendants’ practices, there are no antagonistic or conflicting interests that\nwould prevent the Class Representatives from safeguarding the rights of absent Settlement Class\nmembers. \nThe second requirement is also met.  Counsel for the Plaintiffs are qualified and\nexperienced in class action and civil rights litigation.  Bienvenu Affidavit.  Class Counsel have\ndiligently pursued this case on behalf of the Named Plaintiffs and absent Settlement Class\nmembers and are continuing to do so.  Thus, the adequacy requirement is met.\n3. The Proposed Settlement Class Satisfies the Rule 23(b) Requirements\nOnce the Court finds that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, the Court must\ndetermine whether or not the action is maintainable as a class action under one or more\nprovisions of Rule 23(b).  See, e.g., Senter v. Gen. Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 525 (6th Cir.\n1976).  Courts have certified class actions under both Rules 23(b)(2) and (b)(3) when both\nmonetary compensation and equitable relief are at issue.  See, e.g., Molski v. Gleich, 318 F.3d\n16\n\n937 (9th Cir. 2003); Senter v. Gen. Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511 (6th Cir. 1976).   As the claims\nhere satisfy the requirements of both Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3), the Court should certify the Class.\na.    Rule 23(b)(2) Certification Is Appropriate\nCertification is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2) where the defendant has “acted or refused\nto act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(2); Marcus v. Kan., Dep’t of Revenue, 206 F.R.D. 509, 513 (D. Kan. 2002).  This case\ninvolves a class of individuals who claim that they were unlawfully strip searched pursuant to a\nblanket policy.  See Compl. ¶¶ 44, 48.  This is precisely the type of case where certification under\nRule 23(b)(2) is appropriate.  See Marcus, 206 F.R.D. at 513 (finding certification appropriate\nunder Rule 23(b)(2) where defendant had allegedly violated the law “in a manner that is\ngenerally applicable to the class”);  Wilfong v. Rent-A-Center, Inc., No. 00-CV-680, 2001 WL\n1795093, at *7-8 (S.D. Ill. Dec. 27, 2001).\nb.    Rule 23(b)(3) Certification Is Appropriate\nClass certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate when “questions of law or fact\ncommon to the members of the class predominate” and “a class action is superior to other\navailable methods” of adjudicating the controversy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); Wilfong, 2001 WL\n1795093, at *7-8.  Here, Plaintiffs’ claims are properly certified under Rule 23(b)(3) because\nPlaintiffs satisfy both the “predominance” and the “superiority” requirements. To satisfy the\npredominance requirements, Plaintiffs must show that one or more common issues predominate\nover individual issues and that one trial of common issues is superior to conducting literally\n17\n\nhundreds or thousands of separate trials.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  The primary purpose of\nRule 23(b)(3) is to promote efficiency and to take advantage of the economy that results from\njointly adjudicating a large number of claims that share one or more common questions. See Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23 Advisory Committee Notes, 1966 Amendments; see also Sterling v. Velsicol\nChemical Corp., 855 F.2d 1188, 1196 (6th Cir. 1988) (goal of Rule 23(b)(3) is “to achieve the\neconomies of time, effort, and expense”).  \n“Common issues predominate within the meaning of Rule 23(b)(3) when they constitute a\nsignificant part of the litigation.”  Wilfong, 2001 WL 1795093 at *8; see also Jenkins v. Raymark\nIndustries, Inc., 782 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir. 1986).  The predominance requirement addresses\nefficiency by making certain that class wide issues outweigh individual issues.  See Sterling, 855\nF.2d at 1197. The claims in the Action are based on what Plaintiffs allege to be a single course of\nconduct: the Defendants’ unconstitutional policy of strip searching all pre-arraignment detainees\nwithout individualized reasonable suspicion.  Thus, Plaintiffs face a common set of factual and\nlegal issues and a common cause of injury that predominates over individual questions.\nSince all Settlement Class members have the right to opt out of the settlement, there is\nnothing that prevents any plaintiff from continuing to prosecute his or her claim for monetary\nrelief individually.  See, e.g., In re Inter-Op Hip Prosthesis Liab. Litig., 204 F.R.D. 330, 347\n(N.D. Ohio 2001); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A).  Further, the relief provided in the Settlement\nAgreement would not be available in the absence of the class treatment.  See Hip Prosthesis, 204\nF.R.D. at 347-48.\nC. The Court Should Approve the Proposed Settlement Notices and Authorize \nTheir Dissemination\n18\n\n“[I]n any proceeding [that] is to be accorded finality,” due process requires that interested\nparties be provided with “notice reasonably calculated, under… the circumstances, to apprise\n[them] of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.” \nMullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).  The notice must be\nreasonably calculated to reach interested parties and where the names and address of the\ninterested parties are known, due process requires mailed notices.  Id. at 318-19; Dejulius v.\nSprint Corp., 429 F.3d 935 (10th Cir. 2005).\nThe contents of class notice must ‘“fairly apprise the . . . members of the class of the\nterms of the proposed settlement and of the options that are open to them in connection with [the]\nproceedings.”’  Maywalt v. Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co., 67 F.3d 1072, 1079 (2d Cir. 1995)\n(quoting Weinberger v. Kendrick, 698 F.2d 61, 70 (2d Cir. 1982)).  Class notice is sufficient if it\n“may be understood by the average… class member.”  In re Nissan Motor Corp. Antitrust Litig.,\n552 F.2d 1088, 1104 (5th Cir. 1997); see also Churchill Village L.L.C. v. Gen. Elec., 361 F.3d\n566, 575 (9th Cir. 2004)(“Notice is satisfactory if it generally describes the terms of the settlement\nin sufficient detail to alert those with adverse viewpoints to investigate and to come forward and\nbe heard.”)(internal quotation marks & citation omitted).\nHere, the proposed notices and their method of dissemination meet these requirements. \nThe proposed notices clearly and concisely inform Settlement Class members of all the relevant\naspects of the litigation: (a) the Class definition and statement of claims; (b) the litigation history;\n(c) the terms of the Settlement Agreement; (d) the binding effect of any judgment approving the\nSettlement on those who do not opt out; (e) the right to object to the Settlement and the\n19\n\nprocedure for doing so; (g) whom to contact to obtain additional information regarding the\nSettlement or the litigation; (h) the amount of compensation requested for the Class\nRepresentatives to compensate them for their services to the Class; and (i) the amount requested\nfor reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  Thus, the notices provide all the information necessary\nfor Settlement Class members to make an informed decision with respect to whether to remain in\nor opt out of the Settlement Class or whether to object to the proposed Settlement.  Further,\ndelivery by first class mail to the Settlement Class members’ last known addresses is designed to\nreach the members in the most expeditious and economical way.  In addition, summary notice of\nthe Settlement will be published in local newspapers and will be broadcast on three local radio\nstations in order to notify Settlement Class members who are not notified of the Settlement\nthrough other means.\nD. The Court Should Schedule a Fairness Hearing and Approve the Proposed \nSchedule for the Mailing of Settlement Notices, the Return of Opt-Outs, and\nthe Filing of Objections\nThe Parties propose the following sequence of events and deadlines, assuming the Court\ngrants this Motion for Preliminary Approval:\nMailing of Notice Package to Class: 45 days after preliminary approval.\nOpt out deadline: 45 days after mailing of Notice Package.\nObjections to settlement: 45 days after mailing of Notice Package. \nFairness Hearing: At least 135 days after preliminary approval.\nClaims Deadline: 30 days after final approval hearing.\n20\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Parties respectfully request that the Court issue its Order,\nsubstantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B,\n(1) Preliminarily approving the Settlement Agreement;\n(2) Conditionally certifying the proposed Settlement Class;\n(3) Appointing Named Plaintiffs as Class Representatives; \n(4) Appointing counsel for Named Plaintiffs herein as Class Counsel; \n(5) Approving the form and manner of Notice to be sent to Settlement Class \nMembers and Summary Notice to be published in various newspapers in\naccordance with the Settlement Agreement; \n(6) Approving the forms for, and setting deadlines with respect to, claims, opt \nouts, and objections; and \n(7) Setting a date for a final fairness hearing.\nRespectfully submitted,\nROTHSTEIN, DONATELLI, HUGHES, \nDAHLSTROM, SCHOENBURG & BIENVENU, LLP\nRobert R.

Defendants and their employees, agents and representati ves had no valid reason for \nconducting strip searches of the named Plaintiffs. Nothing in the named Plainti frs' histories. nor the \ncircumstances of their arrests. gave Defendants reasonable suspicion that a strip search ol'the named \nPlaintiffs would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.  Rather. the strip search\",> of the \nnamed Plaintiffs were undertaken pursuant to a blanket and indiscriminate policy of strip searching \ndetainees processed at the DACDC, in violation of well-settled constitutional law and standards of \ncorrectional practice. \n42.  Plaintiffs  were  shocked,  repulsed,  humiliated.  ashamed  and  distraught  at  heing \nsubjected to these degrading and dehumanizing invasions of their privacy. \nIV. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n43.  Paragraphs 1 through 42, above, are incorporated herein by reference as i ffully set forth \nin this paragraph. \n44.  The strip searches to which Plaintiffs were subjected were performed pursuant to the \npolicies, practices and customs ofD  efendants of conducting strip searches ofincoll1ing detainees. The \nsearches complained of herein wereperforrned without regard to the nature of the alleged offenses for \n9 \n\nwhich  Plaintiffs  had  been  arrested.  and  without  Defendants  or  their  employees.  agents  and \nrepresentatives having a reasonable belief that the Plaintiffs so  searched possessed weapons or \ncontraband. or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable bdicfthat the searches would produce \ncontraband or weapons. \n45.  This civil action is brought by Plaintiffs on their own hdlUl f and on behalf of a class \nof similarly situated persons. pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  The class for which Plaintiffs seeks \ncertification is defined as follows:  all persons who, in the period from \"'Iarch 3, 20()3, to the present \nand continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices complained of herein cease. were \narrested and subjected to a strip search and/or body cavity search at the Dona A.na County Detention \nfacility pursuant to a policy or practice of conducting strip searches on pre-arraignment arrestees \nwithout individualized reasonable suspicion that the search \"\"ould lead to the disco\\'ery of contraband \nor weapons. \n46.  Plaintiffs are members of the class they seek to rcpresent, and ha\\'e standing to bring \nthis action because they were arrested and subjected to a strip search and.\"))' \\'isual body search at thc \nDACDC in the absence of a reasonable suspicion that the search would be producti\\'c of contraband \nor weapons, as set forth in more detail above. \n47.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, Plaintiffs, indi\\'idually and on behalf of the mcmhers \nof the class, seek such relief as is just and equitable, including but not limited to:  (i)  Com p I ete \ndisclosure of all information within the possession, custody or control of Defendanis conceming. \nrelating to or involving the searches complained of herein; \n(ii)  Iudicial declaration that the searches complained of herein are unlawful: \n(iii) Issuance of a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from engaging in the searches \n10 \n\ncomplained of herein; and \n(iv)  Judgment for compensatory and punitive damages to the fullest extent allowable by law \nfrom Defendants in favor of Plaintiffs and the members of the class for personal and economic inj ury, \nand deprivation of statutory and/or common law rights resulting from Defendants' practices. \n48.  Plaintiffs are unable to state precisely the size of the class. On information and belief. \nPlaintiffs allege that there often are more than ten persons per day who are anested, booked into the \nDACDC and subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of Defendants' policies, \npractices, and customs related to said searches.  Thus, the class is sufficiently numerous that joinder \nof all members herein is impracticable.  The exact number of class nK'mbers will he ascertained \nthrough appropriate discovery, from records maintained by Defendants and their agents. \n49.  Questions oflaw and fact are common to the claims of Plainti frs and the members of \nthc class, including but not limited to (1) whether DACDC officers routinely subject persons anested \nto strip searches and/or body cavity searches; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip searches and!or \nhody cavity searches in the absence of any reasonable suspicion, based on specific and Cl11iculable \nfacts, to believe any particular detainee has concealed drugs, weapons, and or contrahand; (3) whether \nthe strip searehes are conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by \npersons not participating in the searches; (4) whether DACDC officers may lawfully perfonn strip \nsearches and/or body cavity searches without reasonable suspicion, based on speeific and articulable \nfaels, to believe any particular detainee has concealed drugs, weapons or contrahand: (5) whether strip \nsearches and/or body cavity searches may lawfully be conducted in areas \\\\'here the search can be \nohserved by people not participating in the search; and (6) whether or not Defendants' strip search \npolicy and procedure is in accordance with the State and Federal Constitutions. \n11 \n\n50.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class. \ntherehy making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to \nthe class as a whole. \n51.  There is a well-defined community of interest amongst memhers of thc class.  The \nclaims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims ofthc members of the class. The factual bases \nof Defendants' misconduct are common to all class members and represent a common policy and \npractice of blanket strip searches of detainees without reasonable suspicion.  Morco\\·cr. Plaintiffs' \nclaims are based on the same legal theories as those of the class mcmbers. \n52.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nPlaintiffs are  committed to  prosecuting this  action,  and  they have  retained  competent  counsel \nexperienced in civil litigation of this nature. Moreover, the interests of Plaintiffs arc coincident with. \nand not antagonistic to. those of the other members of the class. \n53.  The common questions oflaw and fact herein predominate ovcr questions alTecting any \nindividual class member, and class action treatment provides a superior method for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of the controversy. \n54.  At alI times relevant to the acts alleged herein, and as to eycry causc of action \nasserted. Defendants acted fraudulently, oppressively, maliciously. and in knowing and conscious \ndisregard of Plaintiffs' rights and the rights of class members, as outlined herein. \nV. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTIO:'ol \n(Civil Rights Violations Under 42 l.'.S.c. § 1983) \n55.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference into their first cause of action the allegations of \nparagraphs 1 through 54 above. as fully as ifrealleged and set forth herein. \n12 \n\n56.  The above-described acts and omissions of Defendants were unreasonable. shocking \nto the conscience, and were committed intentionally, maliciously, willfully :lnd'or \\\\·ith reckless or \nddiberate indifTerence, and in violation of the following clearly established constitutional rights of \nwhich a reasonable person would have been aware: \n(a)  Plaintiffs' and class members' Fourth Amendment rights to be free frotllunreasonable \nsearches and seizures; and \n(b)  Plaintiffs' and class members' Eighth Amendment rights to be free from cruel and \nunusual  punishment  and/or  Fourteenth  Amendment  rights  to  substantive  and \nprocedural due process, and to privacy. \n57.  The above-described acts and omissions of Defendants were Ill()tivated by evil \nmotive and intent, and involved recklessness and callous indifference to Plainti ffs' and class members' \nfederally protected rights, justifying an award of punitive damages. \n5S.  Prior to the acts and omissions alleged herein, Defendants t:lilcd to properly create. \nadopt, inculcate and  ensure compliance with appropriate policies and procedures for corrections \nofficers and supen·isorypersOlmel employed by them; failed to properly train, monitor, supervise and \ndiscipline corrections officers and supervisory personnel employed by them. and failed to otherwise \ninstitute and ensure compliance with adequate procedures and policies that would protect the rights \nof Plaintiffs and class members.  These acts and omissions were direct and proximate causes of the \ninjuries complained of by Plaintiffs herein, as set forth below. \n59.  Defendants Dona Ana County, Barela, Wooley, Soliz and/or Roach maintained a \ncustom or policy which permitted or condoned the foregoing  violations of Plaintiffs'  and  class \nmembers' constitutional rights. \n13 \n\n60.  The acts and omissions of the Defendants as set forth abo\\\"(: were unde11ak~n under \ncolorofstatc law and operated to deprive Plaintiffs and the members of the class of their f~deral rights. \nDefendants Barela. Wooley. Soliz and Roach are liable in their individu~l and oftlcial capacities for \ndamages proximately caused by these acts and omissions.  Plaintiffs are also entitled to injunctive \nrelief against the Defendants, including a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from engaging \nin the unlawful practices and procedures complained of herein. \n61.
