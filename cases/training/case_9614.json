Plaintiff was arrested for driving while under the influence and was forced to strip down to her underwear in the presence of a female guard.  A second plaintiff filed a similar suit on January 8, 1997, alleging that she was strip searched naked after being arrested on bad check charges.  The lawsuits of both women were consolidated.</p><p>On January 20, 1998, the District Court (Chief Judge Harold Albritton, III) granted summary judgment to the defendants and dismissed the plaintiffs' claims.  Judge Albritton ruled that the Lee County policy of conducting limited strip-searches of all pretrial detainees prior to placing them into cells was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Magill v. Lee County,  990 F.Supp. 1382 (M.D.Ala. 1998).  Plaintiffs appealed and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed without a reported opinion.  Magill v. Lee County, 161 F.3d 22 (11th Cir. 1998) (Table).</p><p></p>",

WHETHER THE SEARCH POLICIES OF THE SHERIFF'S\nDEPARTMENT ARE NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LEE\nCOUNTY, AS A MATTER OF LAW?\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n(i.) Proceedings below\nAppellees adopt and incorporate by reference the Appellant's\nstatement of the course of proceedings below, on page 8 of their brief.\n(ii.) Statement of Facts\nThe following facts are undisputed and are set out in a light most\nfavorable to the Appellants who were Plaintiffs below. These facts are\nsubstantially the same as those found by the district court on pages 3\nthrough 7. R2-62-3 through 7. Appellees do not find the Appellants'\nstatement of facts particularly objectionable except to the extent it omits\nmany facts which gives proper context to the policy and the individual\nsearches performed. All record references below are derived from a single\ndocument styled \"Evidentiary Materials Supporting Defendants' Motion for\nSummary Judgment.\" R2-54. For simplicity sake, the referent R2-54 is not\nrepeated for each record citation but that is the source of all materials cited\nbelow.\nLee County Detention Facility's General Policies and Procedures.\nSheriff Chapman and Chief Deputy and Jail Administrator Cary\nTorbert, Jr., are responsible for formulating jail policy at the Lee County\n\nDetention Facility. Their general policy is contained in the jail's policy and\nprocedure manual. With regard to inmate searches, a general jail policy can\nbe found at Section 7, Title 7.05, which is entitled \"Security; Searches\". See\nR2-54-Exhibit B, ยถ 2; Deposition of Herman Chapman (hereafter \"Exhibit\nE\"), p. 5, 11.2-9; Deposition of Jennifer Reason (hereafter \"Exhibit F\"), p. 7,\nti. 12-23; p. 8, 11.1-8.\nAs with all the jail policies, the written statement of policy is only a\nbeginning point. The details of the practice and procedure are transmitted\norally. SeeExhibit B, ยถ 3. Aspects of the jail search policy not specifically\ncovered by the written policy include the following:\nAll arrestees or inmates who enter the jail are subjected to a \"pat\ndown.\" See Exhibit B, ยถ 4(a); Deposition of Maxine Gline (hereafter\n\"Exhibit G\"), p. 22, 11.3-6.\nAll inmates or pre-trial detainees who actually enter ajail cell should\nbe subjected to a limited strip search or outer clothing search (as described\nbelow). Persons who have already obtained a bond for their release prior to\ntheir booking are not subjected to the limited strip search or clothing search\ndescribed above.\n\nAdditionally, persons who are in the process of obtaining a bond (i.e.,\nusing the jail telephone to summon a bondsman) and who appear capable of\narranging for the appropriate bond, may be allowed to remain outside a cell\nand normally would not be subjected to the limited strip search or clothing\nsearch described below. SeeExhibit B, ยถ 4(b); Exhibit E, p. 18, 11.21-23; p.\n19, 11.1-10; Exhibit F, p. 33, 1.23; p. 34, 11.1-13; Exhibit G, p. 22, 11.6-11;\np. 23, 11.13-18; p. 25, 11.1-15; p. 37, 11.4-11; p. 39, 11.12-23; p. 40, 11.1-22;\np. 51, 1t.6-13; p. 54, 11.7-23;p. 55, 11.1-12.\nThe limited strip search or outer clothing search is conducted by an\nofficer of the same sex in the \"search room\" to the left of the holding cells.\nThe utmost respect should be given to the arrestee or inmate's privacy as is\npossible under the circumstances. The person being searched is required to\nmove only their outer clothing and their shoes and socks. The person being\nsearched should never be asked to remove their underwear, except when\nthere is reasonable suspicion justifying a body cavity search as described in\nthe written policy and when proper procedure is followed, as discussed in\nExhibit B, paragraph 9.\nThe officer conducting the limited strip search stands in such a way\nas to block any view of the person being searched from those outside the\n4\n\nproperty/search room. The only window in the property room is a narrow,\noblong window approximately three inches wide and thirty inches long.\nThis window was originally built into the door of the search room when the\njail was constructed in 1984, and it has not been changed. See Exhibit B, ยถ\n4(c); Exhibit E, p. 14, 11.2-6; p. 17, 11.9-23; Exhibit F, p. 27, 11. 15-23; p.\n28, 11.1-9; p. 32, 11.1-6; Exhibit G, p. 43, I1. 2-14.\nNo one is allowed to approach the door to the search room or stand in\nthe hallway outside the search room in a manner which would permit them\nto observe a person being searched in the property room. At all times, a jail\nofficer would be on duty in the control room and would prohibit any such\nattempted observation. Another arrestee, inmate, or trusty attempting such\nan observation would be disciplined appropriately. An employee\nattempting such observation would be disciplined appropriately, if not\nterminated. See Exhibit B, ยถ 5; Exhibit E, p. 16, 11.4-10; Exhibit F, p. 33, 11.\n6-19; p. 35, 11.9-21.\nSheriff Chapman and Major Torbert established a policy of subjecting\nall inmates or arrestees entering a jail cell to a limited strip search because\nof their serious concerns about the safety and security of those persons\ninside the jail, including both Sheriff's Department employees and inmates.\n\nSheriff Chapman and Major Torbert have determined that the only way of\npreventing the introduction of contraband into the jail is to require a limited\nstrip searchof all those arrestees or inmates who will be placed in a cell. A\npat-down search, although sufficient to discover large weapons or large\nitems of contraband, is not sufficient to prevent the introduction of smaller\nweapons or smaller items of contrabandinto the jail. In formulating this\npolicy, Sheriff Chapman and Major Torbert balanced the arrestee's\nentitlement to privacy with the need to provide security by requiring only a\nlimited strip search, that is, one which requires the arrestee to remove their\nouter clothing only and allows the arrestee to leave on his or her underwear\n(briefs or boxers for male arrestees and panties and bra for female\narrestees). Although the circumstances are obviously different, the level of\nundress required in this search is no greater than that observable at any\nbeach or pool. SeeExhibit B, ยถ 6; Exhibit E, p. 18, 11.21-23; p. 19, 11.1-10.\nIt has been the experience of Sheriff Chapman and Major Torbert at\nthe jail that the pending charges and/or criminal history of an arrestee are\nnot necessarily reliable indicators of whether the arrestee may attempt to\nintroduce contraband into the jail. It has been their experience that those\npersons addicted to drugs (whether illegal drugs, prescription medications,\n\nor legal intoxicants) have a tendency to attempt to introduce this contraband\ninto the jail. Once inside the jail, the arrestee or other inmate may attempt\nto use these materials to become intoxicated or to harm himself or others.\nThe very presence of these materials tends to create conflict as inmates fight\nover possession. Of course, any inmate or arrestee may attempt to bring a\nweapon into the cell which could be usedto harm himself or others. Sheriff\nChapman and Major Torbert have found that it is often first time offenders\nor weaker inmates, which have heard horror stories of inmate violence, who\nwill try to smuggle in aweapon for their own protection. SeeExhibit B, ยถ 7.\nSheriff Chapman and Major Torbert also decided that it was\nnecessary to search not only the inmates going into the general population,\nbut also those being placed in a holding cell. Sheriff Chapman and Major\nTorbert determined it was necessary to search those in the holding cells\nbecause they could just as well harm themselves or other inmates while in\nthe holding cell as they could while they are back in the general population\nareas. Furthermore, because of the presence of trusties and incoming\ninmates in the area(including those serving meals), contraband could easily\nbe passed from holding cells to the general population via inmates or\ntrusties walking through the front areaof the jail. SeeExhibit B, ยถ 8.\n\nAlthough the jail's policy does provide for full strip searches which\ninclude the search of body cavities when there is reasonable suspicion that\nsuch search is necessary, when the search is approved by the sheriff or chief\ndeputy and when it is performed by medical personnel only (see written\npolicy), Major Torbert never remembers a single time that anything beyond\ntheir limited strip search was actually conducted. In other words, Major\nTorbert does not recall a single instance where a person was required to\nremove anything more than their outer clothing. If this had ever happened,\nMajor Torbert would or should know. See Exhibit B, ยถ 9; Exhibit E, p. 9, I1.\n19-23; p. 10, 11. 1-19; p. 23, 11. 13-16; p. 23, 11.22-23; p. 24, 11. 1-14; p. 32,\n11. 18-20; Exhibit F, p. 19, 11. 12-23; p. 20, 1t. 1-3; Exhibit G, p. 32, 11.8-15,\n23; p. 33, 11.1-7; p. 34, 11.15-23; p. 35, 11.1-13; p. 37, 11.17-22; p. 46, 11.21-\n23; p. 47, 11. 1-23; p. 48, 11.1-13.\nIf a member of the Lee County jail staff ever asked an arrestee to\nremove anything more than their outer clothing without following the\npolicy on full strip search and body cavity searches, that staff member\nwould be acting directly contrary to jail policy and would be disciplined\nappropriately, if not terminated. See Exhibit B, ยถ 10; Exhibit E, p. 24, 11.15-\n22; p. 28, 11.12-23; p. 29, 11.1-8; Exhibit G, p. 32, 11.1-7.\n\nMajor Torbert is regularly in the jail area and among inmates. Until\nthe Magill-Hudmon lawsuit was filed, no one had ever, to his knowledge,\neven alleged that they were treated improperly while being searched before\nadmission to the jail. Se__E_x_hgibeit B, ยถ 11; Exhibit E, p. 18, II. 1-4; p. 20, I1.\n6-8; p. 32, 11. 13-17 (no prior report of any improper strip searches).\nSharon C. Magill\nSharon Cantrell Magill, a forty-two year old female, was arrested\nduring the early morning hours of June 3, 1996, at approximately 2:26 a.m.\nby State Trooper James D. Patterson in Opelika, Alabama, on U. S.\nHighway 280. Magill, who lives in Birmingham, Alabama, had been called\nby her friend, who was pregnant and going into labor, to come to Columbus,\nGeorgia in order to assist her with her labor as her friend's husband was\nhesitant and didn't [sic] want to do labor.\" See Deposition of Sharon Magill\n(hereafter \"Exhibit A\"), p. 10, I1. 7-19. Magill was called by her friend on\nFriday night, June 2, 1996, around 1!:00 p.m., and Magill left the restaurant\nin which she was having dinner to meet her friends in Opelika. See Exhibit\nA, p. 11, 11.1-7. From 11:00 p.m. until she was arrested at 2:30 a.m., Magill\nhad several beers, including those she had before she left Birmingham, see\n9\n\nExhibit A, p. 13, 11. 11-14, a beer that she drank on the way from\nBirmingham to Opelika, id. at I1. 14-15, and a beer that she drank on the\nway from Opelika to Columbus, Georgia, which was purchased by Magill at\na gasstation in Opelika after shemet her friends, Exhibit A, p. 13, 11.16-22.\nMagill and her friends, who were driving in a car ahead of Magill,\nwere pulled over by State Trooper James Patterson for speeding. See\nExhibit A, p. 12, 11.2-5. After Magill and her friends had a discussion with\nState Trooper Patterson, he allowed her friends to return to their car to go on\nto the hospital; however, Trooper Patterson specifically instructed Magill\nnot to leave as he felt that she had been drinking. Id. at p. 12, 11.21-22; p.\n13, 11.1-7. Neither of Magill's friends had been drinking prior to this time.\nId. at p. 18, 11.10-12. Patterson then administered one or two breathalyzer\ntests to Magill and advised her that she was over the legal limit. Id. atp. 14,\n11.13-23; p. 15, 11.1-4. Trooper Patterson adminiStered a series of field\nsobriety tests to Magill and then advised Magill that he was taking her to the\ncounty jail. Id. atp. 16, 11.1-7.\nUpon being informed of her arrest for DUI, Magill begged Trooper\nPatterson not to arrest her, cried a lot, and was visibly upset. SeeExhibit A,\np.16, 11.8-20. Despite Magill's being very upset and begging Trooper\n10\n\nPatterson not to arrest her, Magill was placed under arrest and taken to the\nLee County Detention Facility. Id. at p. 19, 11.1-4. Upon arriving at the\nLee County Detention Facility, Magill was taken into the\nphoto/identification room where she was administered one or two more\nbreathalyzer tests and signed the ticket issued to her by State Trooper\nPatterson. See Exhibit A, p. 21, 11. 1-3. Magill was then escorted by\nTrooper Patterson to the control/booking room, which is a glassed-in\ncubicle in the holding area. Id. at 11.13-17. Magill turned in all of her\npersonal effects, including her jewelry and purse and was placed in a\nholding cell by ajailer, as Trooper Patterson turned her over to the custody\nof the Lee County Detention Facility. Id. at p. 21, 11. 18-23; p. 22, 11.11-12;\np. 23, I1. 6-21. Throughout the time prior to being placed into the holding\ncell, Magill was visibly upset and sobbing. Id. at p. 23, 11.22-23; p. 24, 11.\n1-13.\nWithin a few moments, an African-American female jailer, came to\nMagill's cell and escorted her to the property/search room. See Exhibit A, p.\n25, 11. 13-22. Once inside the room, the officer instructed Magill to remove\nher clothing and Magill removed her entire clothing except for her bra and\npanties. The officer then placed latex gloves on her hands and Magill asked\n11\n\nthe officer what shewas about to do. Id. atp. 30, 11.3-6. The officer asked\nMagill what shewas in jail for, and Magill responded that she was in for a\nDUI charge. Id. at 11.6-7. The jailer then removed the gloves from her\nhand and told Magill to get dressed. Id_da.t11.7-8.\nAt no time during the jailer's search of Ms. Magill did she ever ask\nher to remove her undergarments, either her bra or panties, nor did the\nofficer ever physically touch Magill in any way. SeeExhibit A, p. 30, 11.9-\n11; p. 31, IL 3-4. At no time was any other officer, male or female, present\nin the room, nor does Magill recall having seenanyone looking in the small\nrectangular window in the door. Id. at p. 31, 11.9-12; p. 35, 11.3-6 and 11.\n20-23; Exhibit H. At no time did the jailer say anything to Magill that she\nfound offensive or inappropriate. Se__E_x_heibeit A, p. 37, 11.21-23; p. 38, 11.1-\n3. Rather, the only thing that Magill found to be offensive was the fact \"that\nanother woman [was] looking at my breasts and at the lower area of my\nbody.\" Id. at p. 38, 11.4-8. Magilt was never asked to remove her\nunderwear by the jail officer, but Magill was wearing a \"white French-cut\nbra and it was revealing\" and \"white sheerpanties.\" Id. at p. 38, 11.11-16.\nDuring the time in which Magill was undressing, she asked the jailer\nwhy shehad to undress in front of the window, andthe jailer moved over in\n12\n\nfront of the window, located in the door, in order to block the window. See\nExhibit A, p. 31, 11.14-19. However, Magill claims that the officer was\nshorter than she and did not fully cover the window. Id. at 11.19-20; p. 32,\n11.16-22; Exhibit H.\nMagill was then returned to her holding cell, where she remained for\napproximately five hours until she was allowed to bond out. See Exhibit A,\np. 36, 11. 11-17. Throughout the time of the Plaintiff's booking and being\nsearched, Magill continued to cry a lot, be very upset, and be visibly\nshaken. Id. at p. 40, 11. 1-20. At no time, however, did Magill express to\nanyone in the jail that she had a problem with the fact that she had to\nremove her clothes. Id. at p. 45, 11.19-22.\nMag_ll later plead guilty to the DUI charge and was required to pay a\nfine and have her license suspended for three months. See Exhibit A, p. 54,\n11.15-23; p. 55, 11.1-4.\nSherrer Hudmon\nPlaintiff Sherrer Cooper Hudmon, 34-year old female, was arrested\nby the Lee County Sheriff's Department on March 17, 1995, along with her\nhusband, Ken Hudmon, due to their having written approximately\n13\n\n$63,000.00 in bad checks._ See Deposition of Sherrer Hudmon (hereafter\n\"Exhibit C\"), p. 15, 11.9-16; Deposition of Ken Hudmon (hereafter \"Exhibit\nD\"), p. 88, I1.4-23; p. 92, 11.11-21 (seven charges of Negotiating Worthless\nNegotiable Instruments in the amount of $9,000.00 each, totaling\n$63,000.00 in worthless checks),z The Hudmons were first made aware of\nthe outstanding warrants for their arrests on the NWNI charges after\n1Mr. and Ms. Hudmon were arrested on March 17, 1995, on four counts of\nNegotiating Worthless Negotiable Instruments. However, Mr. and Ms.\nHudmon had a total of seven charges against them for Negotiating\nWorthless Negotiable Instruments.\n2 Ms. Hudmon was tried on one of the worthless check charges and found\nguilty. Ms. Hudmon planned to appeal her conviction. In the interim, the\nsix remaining NWNI charges were tried against Ms. Hudmon and she was\nfound not guilty. Prior to appealing the conviction on one of the NWNI\ncharges, a settlement was reached between the Hudmons and the person\nwho brought the charges, to whom the money was owed, in which releases\nwere signed and $4,500.00 was paid by the Hudmons in satisfaction of this\nsettlement agreement. See Exhibit C, p. 92, 11. 11-21; p. 96, 11.2-23; p. 97,\n11.t-23.\n14\n\nreceiving the arrest warrants in the mail from the Worthless Check Unit of\nthe District Attorney's office in.Lee County, Alabama. Se__E_x_h_iebit C, p. 33,\nI1. 4-14. In response, Ms. Hudmon called the Worthless Check Unit on\nMarch 16, 1995, and spoke with Yolanda Fears, who advised Ms. Hudmon\nto come in and sign somepapers the following day. Id. at p. 35, 11.21-23; p.\n36, 11.1-7, 11.19-22. The Hudmons went to the District Attorney's office\nthe following day, March 17, 1995, to meet with Ms. Fears. Id. at p. 37, 11.\n9-10, 11.18-23. Ms. Fears then directed the Hudmons to the Sheriff's\nDepartment, wherein Ms. Fears turned over paperwork to an officer\nworking at the front window of the Sheriff's Department. Id. at p. 38, 11.5-\n10.\nA sheriff's deputy then came and got the Hudmons and escorted them\nto a conference/interview room in the jail facility. Id. at p. 40, 11.1-23; p.\n41, 11.1-12. The deputy explained to the Hudmons that he was trying to\nfind out information on their bond \"because [they] . . . need[ed] to make\nbond.\" Id. at p. 42, 11.9-11. The officer eventually determined that the\nHudmons' bond was to be set at one hundred eighty-nine thousand dollars\n($189,000.00), and suggested to the Hudmons that they call a bondsman in\norder to make their bond. Id. at p. 42, 1.23; p. 43, 11.1-3. The Hudmons\n15\n\nthen contacted Corey Marmaduke of Cherokee Bonding, who came to the\nLee County Detention Facility to meet with the Hudmons. After learning of\nthe significant amount of the Hudmons' bond, Mr. Marmaduke informed\nthe Hudmons that he was unable to \"help [them] out at that amount of\nmoney.\" Id. at p. 43, 11. 4-12. Throughout the entire time in which the\nHudmons were allowed to contact a bonding agency in order to make bond,\nthey remained in the interview/conference room, were never placed into a\nlockup cell, nor were they booked into the jail. Id. at p. 40, 11.20-23; p. 41,\n11.1-4.\nAfter failing to make bond, the Hudmons were escorted into the jail\narea to the booking/control room where a white female booking officer 3\ntook inventory of the Hudmons' personal possessions. See Exhibit C, p. 43,\n11. 12-16; p. 45, 11. 1-15; p. 46, 11. 5-15. Ms. Hudmon then signed an\ninventory sheet for her belongings that were turned over to the booking\nofficer and was escorted to the property/search room. Id. at p. 56, 11.15-18,\n23; p. 57, 11. 1-4. A white female officer, different from the officer who\nbooked Ms. Hudmon into the jail, escorted Ms. Hudmon into the\n3The booking records for Sherrer Hudmon on March 17, 1995, indicate that\nthe booking officer was Jennifer Reasor, a white female officer.\n16\n\nproperty/search room. Id. atp. 55, 11.6-12; p. 56, 1I.5-7.\nThe property/search room in which Ms. Hudmon was taken had a\nwindow in the door which measured approximately 3 inches wide and 2 1/2\nfeet long, but there were no other windows in the room or other entrances in\nwhich people could enter the room. SeeExhibit C, p. 59, 11.7-23; p. 60, 11.\n1-6; Exhibit H. Upon entering the search room, the officer \"told [Ms.\nHudmon] to take off [her] clothes.\" SeeExhibit C, p. 64, 1.3; p. 65, 11.13-\n15. Ms. Hudmon then removed her clothes, including her undergarments,\nalthough the officer never specifically directed Ms. Hudmon to remove her\nundergarments. Id. at p. 65, 11.2-10; p. 66, i1. 1-7 (\"Q. When she said\nremove your clothes, you interpreted that to include your undergarments?\nA. Yes. That's what she meant, whether she said that specifically or\nwhether it was implied. But shetold me to take off my clothes and I did.\").\nThe officer then instructed Ms. Hudmon to pull her hair up and shake her\nhead, open her mouth and bend over. Id. at p. 67, 11.2-5. Ms. Hudmon was\nthen told to put her clothes on. Id. at 11.5-6. After redressing, the officer\ntook Ms. Hudmon from the property/search room to a holding cell.\nThroughout the time of Ms. Hudmon's strip search, at no time was\nthe officer rude or offensive to her, se.__Eexehibit C, p. 62, 11.15-20; the\n17\n\nofficer did not touch Ms. Hudmon in any way, id. at p. 95, 11. 6-7; nor did\nthe officer make any comments about Ms. Hudmon's appearance or\nproposition her in any way. Id. at p. 75, 11.12-14.\nAlthough Ms. Hudmon was upset prior to being searched, the search\nescalated her crying and being upset. Id. at p. 74, 11.2-8. During this entire\ntime, Ms. Hudmon was upset, visibly shaken, crying, and scared to death.\nId. at p. 73, i1. 7-22. Furthermore, at no time in which Ms. Hudmon was\nbeing strip searched did she see anyone peering in the window in the door,\nid. at p. 72, 11. 16-23; p. 73, 11. 1-4; rather, Ms. Hudmon only \"felt like this\nwoman [the officer conducting the search] was getting her.eyes full.\" Id. at\np. 73, 11.5-6. The Plaintiffs' main complaint about the strip search is that\n\"someone that looks extremely 'bull-dikey' [who] is making me take all my\nclothes off and is looking like she is enjoying it, it doesn't matter whether\n700,000 people can see me or not .... [My] main complaint is... I would\nstill have a problem if no one could see me but her... I've been around\ngay and lesbian people a lot. I can pretty much tell by their mannerisms and\nthings like that, and I could tell by the look on her face [that she was\nenjoying it] .... That's my impression.\" Id. at p. 93, 11.21-23; p. 94, 11. 1-\n3,7-9,16-19,23.\n18\n\nThroughout the time in which Ms. Hudmon was in the holding cell,\nwhich was for some six or seven hours, she was in the cell alone and was\nallowed to talk to her husband, who officers allowed to use the phone in an\neffort to make bond. 4 Se_._eExhibit C, p. 78, 11. 6-23; p. 79, 11. 1-12.\nEventually, the Hudmons found a surety to sign for their bond and they\nwere released at 6:45 p.m. on March 17, 1995.\n(iii.) Standard of Review\nAppellees agree with the Appellant that the proper standard of review\nis de novo. Se___C_oele v. U.S.D.A., 133 F.3d 803,805 (1 lth Cir. 1998) (\"This\nCourt applies a de novo standard of review to a district court's grant of\nsummary judgment.\").\n4Upon having his personal effects inventoried, Mr. Hudmon was not placed\ninto a holding cell; rather, he was allowed to use the telephone, for a time\nperiod of approximately six hours, in an attempt to make bond. See Exhibit\nD, p. 24, 11. 14-23. At one point, Mr. Hudmon was placed into a holding\ncell for approximately 10 minutes but was allowed to return to the common\narea, in which the phone was located, to continue making phone calls in an\nattempt to make bond. Se___E&xheibit C, p. 79, 11.4-12.\n19\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nIt is undisputed that Sheriff Herman Chapman of the Lee County\nSheriff's Department requires all detainees who actually enter a jail cell to\nundergo a limited strip search, that is, where the detainee is taken to an\nenclosed room and required to remove only his or her outer clothing to\nallow a visual inspection for contraband which may have escaped detection\nin a pat-down search. It is also undisputed that Appellants Sharon Magill\nand Sherrer Hudmon underwent such a strip search before they were placed\nin a holding cell at the jail awaiting release. The district judge determined,\nafter balancing the detainees' privacy interests against Sheriff Chapman's\ninterest in maintaining the security of the jail, the search policy did not\noffend the Fourth Amendment. This conclusion is consistent with the\nUnited States Supreme Court opinion in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520\n(1979). Because the district court found the search to be constitutionally\nvalid, the lower court did not reach the issues of county liability and\nqualified immunity. If the court had reached those issues, it should have\nfound that Sheriff Chapman's search policies are not attributable to Lee\nCounty and that Sheriff Chapman is entitled to qualified immunity.\nThe district court's opinion is due to be affirmed.\n21\n\nARGUMENT\nI. THE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY FOUND SHERIFF\nCHAPMAN'S SEARCH POLICIES TO BE CONSISTENT\nWITH THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.\nThe district court below, after thoroughly analyzing the Lee County\nJail strip search policy, found it to be consistent with the Fourth\nAmendment and cases interpreting it in the context of strip searches:\n\"Searches of all newly-admitted detainees who are going to be locked-up,\nand in contact with other prisoners, are justified.\" R2-2-17. The district\ncourt's ruling is due to be affirmed.\nAppellants Magill and Hudmon's primary objection appears to be\nthat Sheriff Chapman's policy--calling for the limited strip search (removal\nof outer clothing only) of all detainees who actually enter a jail cell--is an\n\"automatic strip search policy.\" Appellants' Br., p. 20. They are correct in\ncharacterizing the search as being \"automatic\" to the extent that they mean\nthat everyone who enters a jail cell is to undergo the limited strip search; no\nfurther justification, i.e., reasonable suspicion, is required. If they use the\nterm to mean \"automatic\" to mean that no balancing of interests has been\nperformed by Sheriff Chapman and his subordinates in the development of\n22\n\nthe policy, the Appellants are wrong. The undisputed record reveals that the\npolicy was developed in an effort to reach a compromise between jail\nsecurity and the detainee's privacy interest. Although some detainees will\nexperience discomfort in disrobing down to their underwear--even if done\nprivately with only an officer of the same sex present--that discomfort is\noutweighed by the threat that a detainee will smuggle in contraband,\nundetected in a pat-down search, and use it to injure or kill jail staff, other\ninmates or himself.\nThis type of balancing appears to be the same used by the United\nStates Supreme Court when it explicitly approved - against challenges\nmade under both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments - a \"blanket\" strip\nsearch policy (including body cavity search) of all pre-trial detainees who\nhave had contact visits with outsiders) Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520\n(1979). In terms of the Fourth Amendment, the Court explained that\nassuming for present purposes that inmates, both\nconvicted prisoners and pretrial detainees, retain some\nFourth Amendment rights upon commitment to a\n5Certainly, the approval of such searches after a mere contact visit, assumes\nthe validity of such searches upon admission to the detention facility from\nthe outside.\n23\n\ncorrections facility,.., we nonetheless conclude that\nthese searches do not violate that Amendment. The\nFourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable\nsearches, ...and under the circumstances, we do not\nbelieve that these searches are unreasonable.\n441 U.S. at 558 (emphasis added). In terms of the Due Process Clause, the\nCourt again found no violation:\nNor do we think that the four MCC security restrictions\nand practices described in Part III, supra, constitute\n'punishment' in violation of the rights of pretrial\ndetainees under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment .... Ensuring security and order at the\ninstitution is a permissible nonpunitive objective,\nwhether the facility houses pretrial detainees, convicted\ninmates, or both.\n441 U.S. 560-61.\nNothing about the facts of the instant case distinguishes it from the\nfacts of Bell v. Wolfish. The Plaintiffs in both Bell. and the instant case were\nadult pre-trial detainees. In both cases, blanket search policies were\nestablished for security purposes. If anything, Sheriff Chapman's search\npolicy is less intrusive than the one in Bell: Sheriff Chapman did not require\na \"total\" strip search, underwear was not removed; and, no body cavity\nsearch was allowed by the search policy except under exceptional\ncircumstances.\n24\n\nAnother case from this Court approved strip searches anytime \"close\nconfinement\" inmates 6left their cell for any reason. Harris v. Ostrout, 65\nF.3d 912 (llth Cir. 1995). The Court relied upon a \"presumption of\nreasonableness which [the court] must attach to such prison security\nregulations.\" Id. (citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 83-85 (1987) and\nBel___!l)S. heriff Chapman, in administering a jail containing both convicted\ninmates and pre-trial detainees, should benefit from the same \"presumption\nof reasonableness\" when he formulates safety-oriented search policies.\nThe holding of Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (1 lth\nCir. 1992), relied upon by Appellants Magill and Hudmon is distinguishable\nfrom the instant case and does not indicate that Sheriff Chapman's policy is\nunconstitutional. _ First, it must be remembered that Justice upholds the\n6The Harris Court never defined \"close confinement\" but Appellees take the\nposition that the placing of Magill and Hudmon into holding cells amounted\nto \"close confinement.\"\n7 Justice's reliance upon the Fourth Amendment is doubtful in light of\nGraham v. Connor, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 1871 (1989), which questions, in the\ncontext of an excessive force claim, whether the Fourth Amendment\nprovides protection after arrest is completed.\n25\n\nstrip search of ajuvenile in an effort to recover contraband. 96I F.2d at\n193. In Justic___th_ee,juvenile female was required to remove all her clothing\n(including her bra) except her panties. Id. at 191. In the instant case, the\npolicy was not to require anything to be removed beyond the outer clothing.\nThe policy was for female detainees to leave their panties and bra on -\nnothing more revealing than what is generally observable at any beach or\npoolside. But perhaps most notably, the fourteen year old girl in Justice\nwas subjected to this more obtrusive search although her mother was\nalready at the detention facility waiting for her daughter's release. Id. at\n190. The juvenile was released to the mother immediately after the strip\nsearch found no contraband. Id. In other words, in Justic_____thee,re was no\nthreat whatsoever to the security of the detention facility or the inmates and\nstaff therein: the juvenile was never placed in a cell; she had no contact\n(directly or indirectly) with the general population of the facility; she never\nhad the opportunity to harm herself or others. On the other hand, both\nMagill and Hudmon were placed in holding cells for significant amounts of\ntime when in the custody of the Sheriff's Department at the jail. In the\nHudmon case, it was unknown at the time of booking whether Hudmon\nwould even have had the opportunity to bond out quickly or whether she\n26\n\nwould have been taken back to general population (in the event she did not\nmake bond). With Magill, officers were certain she would remain in a cell\nfor several hours as required by law for DUI arrestees. They, unlike the\nJustice juvenile, could have used smuggled contraband to harm themselves\nor others or could have passed it to the general population via contact with\ninmates or trusties working in the front area. Despite dictum that could be\nexpansively read, there is nothing in the holding of Justice which controls\nthe outcome of the instant case especially since the holding of Bell v.\nWolfish appears to be much more \"on point.\"\nThe district court properly awarded the Appellees summary judgment\nbecause the search policy of the Lee County jail is a justified balance\nbetween a detainee's right to privacy and the need for jail security.\nII. SHERIFF CHAPMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO\nQUALIFIED IMMUNITY, HAD THE DISTRICT COURT\nFOUND IT NECESSARY TO REACH THE ISSUE OF\nINDIVIDUAL LIABILITY.\nAppellants Magill and Hudmon contend on pages 24 and 25 that\nthere was no basis for the granting of qualified immunity. The district\ncourt, however, pretermitted any discussion of qualified immunity due to its\n27\n\nconclusion that the search policies were, in fact, constitutional. R2-62-14,\n15 n.9. The court did take the time though to signal its receptivity to the\nqualified immunity defense if the policy was determined to'be\nunconstitutional. Id.\nIf this Court were to find Sheriff Chapman's policies\nunconstitutional, qualified immunity should be granted. The principles of\nqualified immunity are set out in detail in Lassiter v. Alabama A & M\nUniversity, 28 F.3d 1146, 1149-51 (llth Cir. 1994) (en banc opinion).\nUnder those principles, Sheriff Chapman is entitled to be granted summary\njudgment based on qualified immunity.\nThe primary reason Sheriff Chapman is entitled to qualified immunity\nis the failure of the Plaintiffs to show that \"pre-existing law...dictate[d],\nthat is, truly compel[led] (not just suggest[ed] or allow[ed] or raise[d] a\nquestion about), the conclusion for every like-situated, reasonable\ngovernment agent that [Chapman's search policy]...violate[d] federal law in\nthe circumstances.\" 28 F.3d 1150. To the contrary, as discussed su_u_p__in.,\nPart V, pre-existing law, if anything, compels the contrary conclusion:\nChapman's policy of subjecting all detainees who would be placed in a cell\n(as opposed to arrestees who would not be placed in a cell) to a limited strip\n28\n\nsearch was constitutional. In Bell v. Wolfish, the highest court in the land\ncondones a very similar, although more intrusive, policy. In Harris v.\nOstrout, this Court places its imprimatur on the full strip searching of all\n\"close confinement\" inmates whenever they leave their cell.\nThe Appellants rely on Justice v. City of Peachtree City as clearly\nestablishing the constitutional infirmity of Sheriff Chapman's policy.\nHowever, undisputed facts brought out through discovery show that the\ninstant case is distinguishable from Justice with respect to several material\nfacts:\n1. The plaintiff in Justice was a juvenile; 8\n2. The plaintiff in Justice was subjected to a more obtrusive\nsearch than Sheriff Chapman's policy called for;\n3. The plaintiff in Justice was never placed in a cell but searched\nas her mother waited for her release which came directly after the search;\nand,\n8Clearly, any impact the Justice opinion may have on adult cases is dicta\nand \"[d]icta is particularly unhelpful in qualified immunity cases where we\nseek to identify clearly established law.\" Hamilton By and Through\nHamilton. Cannon., 80 F.3d 1525, 1530 (1 lth Cir. 1996),\n29\n\n4. There is no discussion of whether the plaintiff in Justice posed\na suicide threat while, in the instant case, the distraught Plaintiffs arguably\nfit potential suicide profiles.\nA reasonable officer in the position of Sheriff Chapman could\nreasonably (even if mistakenly) have considered Bell and Ostrout, both\nadult confinement cases, to control over Justice, a search of a juvenile\nwhich was made incident to an arrest without expectation of confinement.\nAs argued above, the plaintiff in Justice presented no threat of self-harm or\nharming others while being incarcerated; she was never incarcerated and\ntherefore would never have had the opportunity to use secreted contraband.\nBell and Ostrout are much more to the point because they both address\nsecurity concerns unique to confinement. While the loss of personal privacy\nis a factor to be considered - and remember Chapman's policy limited\nexposure and sought to protect privacy from all others except the search\nofficer - it is clearly outweighed by the threat that a detainee or inmate\nmight hide a weapon or contraband which would be used to cause harm if\nnot death while the person is in the custody of the sheriff. After all, who\nwill be the first person sued when an inmate commits suicide with a hidden\nrazorblade or crack supply? Who will be blamed when the detainee is\n30\n\nassaulted by another inmate able to procure a weapon from new admittees?\nThe sheriff, of course. And the first question will be, \"Why wasn't that\nperson searched before he or shewas admitted to the jail?\"\nAdditionally, even though there is no evidence that either Magill or\nHudmon were subjectively considered suicide risks and searched as a\nprecaution therefor, if a reasonable officer could have concluded that a strip\nsearch was justified on that basis, Chapman would be entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\nFinally, the presence of doubt as to whether the Plaintiff's claim\nproperly falls under the Fourth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment\njustifies the granting of qualified immunity. In Graham v. Connor, 109 S.\nCt. 1865 (t989), the United States Supreme Court explained the tension\nbetween the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment with respect to\npretrial detainees:\nOur cases have not resolved the question whether the\nFourth Amendment continues to provide individuals\nwith protection against the deliberate use of excessive\nphysical force beyond the point at which arrest ends and\npretrial detention begins and we do not attempt to answer\nthat question today. It is clear however, that the Due\nProcess Clause protects a pretrial detainee from the use\nof excessive force that amounts to punishment.\n31\n\nId. at 1871 n.10 (citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535-39 (1979).\nAlthough the Court was speaking in terms of excessive force, the same\nreasoning should apply to the search of a pretrial detainee once he or she is\nin custody. The point where Fourth Amendment protection ends and\nFourteenth Amendment protection begins has not been clearly established,\nnot to mention the content or quality of that protection. The Eleventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals has granted qualified immunity to law\nenforcement officers in the context of excessive force, where it was unclear\nwhether the plaintiff's rights were established by the Fourth or Fourteenth\nAmendment. Se___W__ri_geht v. Whiddon, 951 F.2d 297, 301 (1 lth Cir. 1992)\n(explaining the uncertainty as to when the Fourth Amendment ends and the\nFourteenth Amendment begins before holding that \"[t]he presence of such\ndoubt about the existence and content of the constitutional right that [the\ndefendant] is alleged to have violated is enough to entitle him to qualified\nimmunity\").\nIII. THE SEARCH POLICIES OF THE SHERIFF'S\nDEPARTMENT ARE NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LEE\nCOUNTY, AS A MATTER OF LAW.\nAppellants Magill and Hudmon raise, as their initial issue, the\n32\n\nquestion of whether Sheriff Chapman's search policy is attributable to Lee\nCounty. The district court below, however, never reached that issue since\nit found the search policy to be constitutional. R2-62-20 n.14.\nAssuming for the sake of argument that the liability of Lee County\nwas properly before the Court on this appeal, it is clear that Sheriff\nChapman is not a county policymaker with respect to the jail search policy.\nThis conclusion directly follows from the Court's en banc holding in\nTurquitt v. Jefferson County, Ala., 137 F.3d 1285 (1lth Cir. 1998). Turquitt\nheld that Jefferson County is not \"liable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for injuries\nbefalling a county jail inmate arising from the sheriffs management of the\njail.\" Id. at 1286. Sheriff Chapman's search policy, like the inmate\nclassification and supervision policies at issue in Turquitt, clearly falls\nunder the sheriff's management of the jail and has nothing to do with the\ncounty's responsibility to erect and maintain the jail. As this Court\nobserved in Turquitt, \"Alabama counties have no duties with respect to the\ndaily operation of the county jails and no authority to dictate how the jails\nare run.\" Id. At 1291. Alabama law bestows only upon the sheriff \"legal\ncustody and charge of the jail in his county.\" Ala. Code ยง 14-6-1 (1995).\nContrary to the Appellants' position, the holding of the United States\n33\n\nSupreme Court in McMillian v. Monroe County, 117 S. Ct. 1734 (1997)\nlends support to the conclusion that the sheriff is a state rather than county\npolicymaker in terms of jail management; McMillian is cited throughout the\nTurquitt opinion. Just as the county commission, in the law enforcement\ncontext, \"cannot instruct the sheriff how to ferret out crime, how to arrest a\ncriminal, or how to secure evidence of a crime,\" McMillian, 117 S. Ct. at\n1739, the county commission cannot instruct the sheriff, in the jail context,\nwhen or in what manner arrestees, detainees or inmates are to be searched, or\nhow to otherwise provide for inmates' security once they are in the sheriff's\ncare.\nFinally, construing the Sheriff of Lee County to be county\npolicymaker is inconsistent with the well-settled law that a sheriff is a state\nofficer for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Parker v.\nWilliams, 862 F.2d 1471, 1476 (1 lth Cir. 1989); Free v. Granger, 887 F.2d\n1552, 15'57 (llth Cir. 1989); see also Carrv. City of Florence, Ala., 960\nF.2d 1521, 1526 (llth Cir. 1990).\nBecause the district court found Sheriff Chapman's search policy to\nbe constitutional, its consideration of county liability was pretermitted. Had\nit reached this issue, application of Turquitt's en banc holding would have\n34\n\nrequired that Lee County be granted summary judgment.\n35\n\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the foregoing, Appellees request that this Court affirm the\ndistrict court's holding below in all respects.\nRespectfully submitted this the 29th day of July, 1998.\nON\nATTORNEY FOR DEFENDANTS-\nAPPELLEES\nOF COUNSEL:\nWEBB & ELEY, P.C.\n166 Commerce Street, Suite 300\nPost Office Box 238\nMontgomery, Alabama 36101-0238\n(334) 262-1850\n36\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI hereby certify that I have served a copy of the foregoing Brief of\nAppellees upon:\nJeffrey W.

Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979) and Justice\nv. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11 t_Cir. 1992)\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nA. COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS AND DISPOSITIONS IN THE COURT\nBELOW\nThe complaint of the plaintiff was filed against defendant on August 4,\n1995. (RI-I-1). An amended complaint was filed on September 6, 1995. (R1-2-\n1). The defendant answered on October 17, 1995. (R1-5-1). Discovery was had\nand done.\nDefendant filed their motion for summary judgment on November 22, 1996.\n(R1-29-1). Plaintiff responded on December 13, 1996. (R1-33-1). Summary\nJudgment was granted on Janury 21, 1997. (R1-36-1), with an opinion by the\nDistrict Court. Notice of Appeal was filed on January 24, 1997. (R1-37-1)\n\nB. STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\nThis case involves the juxtaposition of the United States Constitution, more\nprecisely, the fourth amendment's ban against unlawful searches and seizures\nwith the state's need to utilize strip searches as tools in maintaining security and\nlocating contraband in institutions. The factual items under scrutiny will be (1) the\nstrip search policy of Sheriff Chapman; (2) the two plaintiffs and the charges\nagainst them, their jail status, the types of persons they are, and the circumstances\ninvolving the stripping off of their clothes to their undergarments.\nSheriff Chapman's policy, (plaintiffs' exhibit one), says:\n1. 1. Strip Search: A search during which an inmate is required to\nremove his clothing.\n2. 3. Strip Searches shall be done at the following times:\na. After an inmate who is housed in the facility is booked, unless\nprohibited by law.\n3. 3. Body Cavity Seareh: A visual, manual, or instrument inspection of\nan inmate's anal or vaginal cavity.\n4. 5. Body Cavity Searches shall be done only by medical personnel and\nupon the order of the Chief Deputy Sheriff or his designee.\nSheriff Chapman's deposition, (plaintiffs' exhibit two), details the policy.\n\nHe statesthat the room where the searches were done was done with his\napproval, (Chapman depo, page 9) and that this was the search room pursuant to\nthejail policy for strip searching inmates. This room hasa window in the door\nso that anyone in the area can look inside, (plaintiffs' exhibit, three). Sheriff\nChapman statesthat there was no magistrate available to get a searchwarrant\nbecause hebelieved the law gavehim the power searchinmates without awarrant.\n(Chapman depo,page 11).\nChapman claims in his deposition that the w::txen policy meanssomething\ndifferent than what it says. Chapman tells us that where the policy says\n\"clothing\"--see above, it really means \"outer clothing\". (Chapman depo, page 14).\nAny inmate who takes off his clothing after being ordered to take off his clothing is\nnot obeying the policy. (Chapman depo, page 15).\nThe searcheswere conducted in a room with awindow and the deputies\nwere instructed to standin front of the windows. The deputies v-ere also\ninstructed to visually search the the entire body of the inmate, front and back.\nNormal searchprocedure is for the searching person to move while the person\nbeing searchedstandsstill. It was part of Sheriff Chapman's policy to conduct\nsearches in aroom with a window. (Chapman depo,page 18).\nWhen askedabout the extent of the strip searchpolicy, Sheriff Chapman\n10\n\nanswered as follows:\nQ: Do you have apolicy of strip-searching, under your definition of strip\nsearchin plaintiffs' exhibit one, female detainees without any reasonable\nsuspicion of them having weapons or contraband under their outer clothing?\nA: I have a policy that everybody that comes in that jail andput under\narrest andmay stay in there any length of time, other than just to make bond and\nwalk out, that they besearched-\nQ: Strip-searched?\nA: -for contraband or drugs.\nQ: Is that under the strip search definition?\nA: Right.\nSheriff Chapman saidthat he approved of the strip searches of the\nplaintiffs and said that the searches were done within his policy. (Chapman\ndepo, page21).\nEvelyn Maxine Glines, ajailer for Sheriff Chapman atthe time of the\nincidents, testified about the strip searchpolicy andthe room, (Plaintiffs' exhibit\nfour).\nShe stated that one could see through the window of the room where the\nsearches were conducted. She said that sometimes up to twenty searches a day\n11\n\nwere done in that room. (Glines depo, page 40-43). Shestated it was the\nsheriff's policy to strip sem'chall people who are booked andput in aholding\ncell. (Glines depo,page 40 &41).\nGonophore Lynx Reasonwas ajailer for Sheriff Chapman and shewas the\nbooking officer when Ms. HUDMON was searched, (plaintiffs' exhibit five).\nShesaidthat Ms. HUDMON was put into a holding cell while her\nhusband usedthe phone to contact a bondsman. She saidthat the reason Ms.\nHUDMON was strip-searched was becausethey put her in the holding cell, while\nher husband usedthe phone, (Reason depo,page 32-33). Ms. Reason also verified\nthe reason Ms. HUDMON was searched--and her husband was not--was because\nshewas in the holding cell andher husband was using the phone. (Reason depo,\npages 12,13& 33).\nKen HUDMON stated that he saw them strip- search his wife and in that\ntwenty foot area,there were prisoners who could seealso, (Hudmon affidavit,\nplaintiffs' exhibit six). He stated that they were responding to a card that they had\nreceived from the bad check division. They were not even aware that they were\ngoing to bearrested.\nSherrer Hudmon stated that they told her to take off her clothes. She\nstated that there were people in the booking areathat could look inside. She\n12\n\nstated that the police woman who did the search was getting an \"eye full\".\n(Hudmon deposition, pages 61,64-67,72-74, plaintiffs' exhibit seven).\nSharon Magill was also strip-searched by a jailor working for Sheriff\nChapman and following his policy. Ms. Magill was following her girlfriend to the\nhospital where her girlfriend was going to have a baby. Ms. Magill and her\ngirlfriend were picked up for speeding, Ms. Magill charged with D.U.I.. Ms.\nMagill was strip-searched in the same room with the window, where Ms. Hudmon\nwas searched. (Magill depo, page 31-32, plaintiffs' exhibit eight). Ms. Magill was\nnot put in the general population, but in a holding cell for the required time to get\nover the D.U.I.. She stayed in the holding cell for five hours. (Magill depo, page\n36). Magill signed a personal bond to get out after her five hours were up.\n(Magill depo, page 37). Magill was strip-searched to her bra and panties.\nBoth plaintiffs were strip-searched without any consideration about whether\nthey had any contraband inside their clothes pursuant to the automatic strip\nsearch policy of Sheriff Chapman.\n13\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE STANDARD OF REVIEW\nThe district court's conclusions of law and its application of law to the facts is\nde novo review. Massaro v. Mainlands Section 1 & 2 Civic Assn., Inc., 3 F.3d\n1472 (llth Cir. 1993).\n14\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe court's determination that the defendants' strip search policy did not\nviolate the fourth amendment is contrary to law.\n15\n\nARGUMENT\nCOUNTY LIABILITY\nAs happens in every case, the County, to which has the responsibility\nunder law to maintain a jail within its county borders, Alabama Code, 11-14-10,\nrequests summary judgment or dismissal claiming that they have no control or\nauthority over the sheriff and the jail. And while that may be true, that also is\nnot the law. The actual exercise of authority or control is not what controls.\nWhat controls is the power to exercise or control. If the county abdicates county\nauthority to the sheriff, then the sheriff becomes the policy maker for the\ncounty. In McMillan v. Monroe Count-v, Alabama, 11.7 S. Ct. 1734 (1997), the\nSupreme Court decided that \"in determining a local government's Section 1983\nliability, a court's task is to identify those who speak with final policymaking\nauthority for the local governments.\" The Court went on to say that whether or\nnot the sheriff acts for the county or the state depends on state law. The rest of\nthe case was easy to decide. The court decided that only the sheriff has the\nauthority to make policy in the area of law enforcement. A county simply has no\nlaw enforcement authority.\nBut we are not dealing in an area of law enforcement, but in the area of\nconfinement. In this area, there is a dual function. The county has to maintain the\n16\n\njail and the sheriff hasto run thejail. The goals andpolicies aredual in nature\nand since the County has decided not to interfere with the sheriff, then so be it.\nThat simply doesnot alter its duties andresponsibilities as provided by Alabama\nStatute. If the Alabama legislature wants to make the county jails the state's\nresponsibility, then they have only to passthat taw. Until they do, the law is what it\nsays it is: \"Every county shall be required to maintain ajaii within their county.\"\nAlabama Code, 11-14-10, 1975.\nSHERIFF'S LIABILITY FOR UTILIZING AN UNCONSITUTUTIONAL\nPOLICY\n\"According to the Eleventh Circuit, 'although Section 1983 does require\nproof of an affirmative causal connection between the official acts or omissions\nand the alleged constitutional deprivation, personal participation...is only one of\nseveral ways to establish the requisite causal cormection.' Swint v. City of\nWadley, Alabama, 51 F.3d 988 (1 lth Cir. 1995); Zatler v. Wainwright, 802 F.2d\n397 (1 lth Cir. 1986). In Zatler, the court explained that a prison official may be\nheld liable 'where a policy or custom that he established or utilized in deliberate\nindifference to an inmates constitutional rights.' Zatler, 801 F.2d 401. The court\nin Swint elaborated on the prior discussion in Zatler, stating that 'personal\nparticipation is not the sine qua non for the defendant to be found personally\n17\n\nliable under Section 1983. Liability may be imposed dueto the existence of an\nimproper policy or from the absenceof a policy.' Swint, 51 F.3d 999, quoting\nRivasv. Freeman, 940 F.2d 1491 (1lth Cir. 1991).\" (Memorandum opinion,\nJudge Albritton, May 20, 1997,Magill & Hudmon v. Lee County, et al.).\nUnder Alabama Law, the defendant Sheriff of Lee County, is responsible\nfor the Lee County Jail and its policies. Ala. Code, Section 14-6-1 (1996).\nAlabama Code Section 14-6-1 statesthat \"the sheriff hasthe legal custody and\ncharge of thejail in his county and all prisoners committed thereto, except in\ncasesotherwise provided by law...\". Furthermore, Sheriff Chapman admits that\nhe utilized the policy in effect at the time of the strip searches and that he\napproved of what the deputies did to the plaintiffs and that, in his opinion, those\ndeputies were following the policy. (Chapman depo, page 21). So we are not\ndealing with any agency questions here. We are dealing with direct liability under\nMonell v. Department of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978).\nTHE UNCONSTITUTIONAL POLICY: THERE WAS NO BALANCING\nTEST DONE\nPlaintiffs claim that this particular policy subjected them to unreasonable\nsearches in violation of the fourth amendment of United States Constitution.\nPlaintiffs claim that under this amendment, they have:\n18\n\n\"...the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\npapers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be\nviolated...\"\nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs .lost their right to object to state\nofficials looking at them without their clothes on (in their undergarments) when\nthey were arrested and could not make bond quick enough to get out (ironically, the\npolicy places a premium on a person's wealth as to whether or not they will have\nto reveal themselves). Both Reason and Glines testified that the reason Hudmon\nwas strip-searched was because it was taking Mr. Hudmon so long to raise the\nmoney to get a bondsman. The court has stated on many occasions that pre-trial\ndetainees do not lose all of their fourth amendment rights. Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520 (1971).\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 559, the Supreme Court set up a balancing of\nthe need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the\nsearch entails. They told courts to consider the scope of the particular intrusion,\nthe manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nThe standard required must be \"an objective standard\". Justice v.\nPeachtree City., 961 F.2d 188 (1 lth Cir. 1992). Thus. all the subjective\nconsiderations of Sheriff Chapman and his jail administrator, Cary Torbert, Jr.\n19\n\nbecome irrelevant. It doesnot matter that if \"we don't strip-search someone and\nthey bring agun in thejail, we could get sued\". What matters is that the sheriff\nfollow the law set out by Justice v. Peachtree City. Otherwise, as can be seen\n_om defendant's brief, anything can be justified.\nThe court in Peachtree City says: \"It is axiomatic that a strip search\nrepresents a serious intrusion upon personal rights.\" The court does not draw a\ndistinction between the strip-search of a juvenile and an adult: \" Although this\nresult troubles us, our reading of Bell and our inabffit) to find any substantial\ndifference between the security and contraband considerations as they relate to\nan adult and to a juvenile lawfully in custody mandate our holding. They use the\nword mandate.\"\nPeachtree City. does not involve an automatic strip search policy, like the\none that Sheriff Chapman had. In Peachtree City, the arresting officer took into\nconsideration various objective items of informatioa.regarding the probability of\ncontraband on the person of the plaintiff. No such considerations were made here.\nIn fact, the arresting officer was not even there when the searches took place. In\nthe case of Hudmon, there was no arresting officer. In the case of Magill, he\nsimply dropped her off, (plaintiffs' exhibit nine). In our case, the defendant Sheriff\nadmits that the plaintiffs were stripped because he has an automatic strip policy\n20\n\nof all people put into holding cells that aren'tjust out in the booking areaawaiting\nbond.\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979) had a automatic strip-search policy.\nAnd it also involved pre-trial detainees. So, the defendant says that they must\nwin. That the policy is the same, thus, they win.\nThe two situations are constitutionally different. Bell v. Wolfish admonishes\nthat the fourth amendment \"is not capable of precise definition or mechanical\napplication. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular\nsearch against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" In Bell,\nthe court upheld the automatic strip-search. But, the institute in Bell, was a\nfederal corrections facility, housing federal inmates for transport to other federal\nfacilities, including pre-trial detainees. The automatic strip search in question was\none done on already incarcerated persons, living in the prison population, inmates,\nand then, only after a contact visit from a person from the outside the institution.\nNeither plaintiff in our case was incarcerated, already incarcerated, had just had a\ncontact visit--nothing more than \"just visiting\". Also, both of the plaintiffs were\ninthejail, awaiting bond. Also, both of the plaintift_ were only inthcjail\ntemporarily, awaiting bond to get out. Neither of the plaintiffs were put into the\ngeneral population. Both of the plaintiffs were put into the holding cells in the\n21\n\nbooking room, away from the general jail population. And, finally, different from\nWolfish, is that both plaintiffs were arrested for minor offenses. Magill, for bad\nchecks, which was really a civil matter, and Magill for driving under the\ninfluence.\nMost cases which have upheld across the board strip search policies have\nsimilarly involved already-incarcerated persons who are routinely searched before\nor after some contact with the outside world. Daughtery v. Harris, 476 F.2d 292\n(10th Cir. 1973). In this case, the court upheld the automatic strip search of a\nfederal penitentiary inmate prior to a court appearance. In Bell v. Manson, 427\nF. Supp 450 (D.Corm. 1976), the court upheld the strip search of pretrial\ndetainees on return from court appearances and other outside visits).\nIn Harris v. Ostrout, 65 F.3d 912 (llth Cir. 1995), the court upheld the automatic\nstrip search of a \"close Confinement\" inmate, citing _.at prisoners have no fourth\namendment protection. The same court in Peachtree City said that pre-trial\ndetainees did not lose their fourth amendment protection. And even in Harris,\nsupra, prisoners have the right not to have strip searches used as a means of\npunishment. It is impossible for the court in Harris to mean anything but what they\nsaid in Harris.\nOn the other hand, across-the-board strip search policies ha re been held\n22\n\nunconstitutional when applied to persons in plaintiffs' position. The case of\nLogan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Circuit 1981); cert. denied, is remarkably on\npoint with Magill's case. The plaintiff in that case was arrested for driving while\nintoxicated and was required to be detained in the county jail for four hours or\nuntil a responsible person arrived to take her home. The county sheriff had\nestablished a policy that all persons to be held (in a holding cell) at the detention\ncenter would be strip-searched for contraband and weapons, regardless of their\noffense or length of stay. The court stated that, in the absence of cause in her\nspecific case to believe she might possess such cont_'aband, a strip search of the\nplaintiff pursuant to the county's blanket policy was in violation of Fourth\nAmendment rights. In Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir. 1980), the court\nheld that a blanket strip search policy by a county sheriff was in violation of the\nFourth Amendment when they strip-searched the female plaintiff arrested for\nspeeding, but unable to post the required forty cash bond.\nThe differences in the two sets of cases are the differences in the two sets\nof people. In one class of people, the people already confined, you have the\nhigh likelihood of smuggling. Already confined prisoners should expect strip\nsearches. That awareness keeps them form caring around contraband or smuggling\ncontraband at the next opportunity. Not so with our plaintiffs. Our plaintiffs do\n23\n\nnot use drugs and commit violent crimes with guns. Their arrest was total shock.\nThe liklehood of a newly-arrested violator concealing contraband on his body is\nsimply not strong enough to authorize an across the board strip search of all of\nthem. The balancing test of Peachtree City. must be used. (Of course, there is\nalso the possibility that true criminal smugglers could get themselves arrested on\npurpose on a minor offense, just to smuggle). However, since the plaintiffs were\nnever put into the prison population, there could be no smuggling.\nThe rule should be the opposite of what Sheriff Chapman's policy says the\nrule is. The rule should be, and this court should adopt, that strip searches of\ntemporary pre-arraignment detainees charged with minor offenses not normally\nassociated with weapons or contraband are permissible under the Fourth\nAmendment only, if there is basis for reasonable suspicion that the particular\ndetainee is concealing a weapon or contraband. Th , is exactly what the Eleventh\nCircuit said in Justice v. City of Peachtree City, supra, the rule is.\nQUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nIt is impossible to believe that the court in Justice v. City of Peachtree\nCi_C__is_u,pra, did not establish clearly defined law. And certainly Bell v. Wolfish\nestablished clearly defined law. That case is cited constantly all over the nation.\nJustice v. City of Peachtree City is decided on the law of _Wolfish, despite\n24\n\nthe fact that it involved ajuvenile. The court said that it had grave doubts as\nto the wisdom of its decision because a juvenile was involved, but went on to\nsay thatthere was no law to distinguish how ajuvenile or an adult should be\ntreated. The fact that there was a juvenile involved then became irrelevant.\nThe plaintiff in Peachtree City was asked to take her bra off and the\ntestimony here is that only one plaintiff took her bra off. Yet, the difference is that\nthese plaintiffs were strip searched automatically. The plaintiff in Peachtree City\nwas strip searched only after a balancing of interests as described by Wolfish.\nThe plaintiff in Justice .was let go after the search proved negative. The\nplaintiffs in our case were let go after they made bond, and were only put in holding\ncells and not in the general population. And also, the plaintiff in Peachtree City\nwas suspected of being involved in a very serious crime, while, our plaintiffs\nwere not.\nAnd finally, the admitted testimony of Sheriff Chapman is that no\nconsideration of whether or not the plaintiffs were suicide threats was taken into\naccount at the time of the searches. It is axiomatic that a search must be justified\nat its inception. New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325 (1985). The defendants\ncannot come back later on and invent reasons to justify themselves.\n25\n\nIN CONCLUSION\nThe appellants request this Honorable Court to reverse the district court and\nreturn the casefor trial on the merits against the appellees Lee County and Sheriff\nChapman.\nOF COUNSEL:\nBENNITT & BUFFORD, LLC\nOne Perimeter Park South\nSuite 325 North\nBirmingham, AL 35243\n(205) 970-0813\n26\n\nCERTIFICTE OF SERVICE\nI hereby certify that a copy of the above and foregoing brief and record\nexcerpts of Appellant has been served upon counsel listed below by placing a copy\nof the same in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed, this the\n/'_Aday of J_-,_ _ ,1998.\nKendrick Webb, Esquire\nWebb & Eley, P.C.\n166 Commerce Street\nSuite 300\nMontgomery, AL 36104\n.J_'_-_-,_SEL -\n27",

Defendant Sheriff Chapman filed a motion\nfor summary judgment on November 10, 1997. Likewise, Defendant Lee County filed a separate motion for\nsummary judgment on the same day. The parties have filed appropriate responses and replies and the motions\nare properly before the court for its consideration. For the reasons discussed herein, summary judgment is due to\nbe GRANTED.\nI. STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers\nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue\nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The party asking for summary judgment\n\"always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying\nthose portions of the `pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\naffidavits, if any,' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\" Id. at 323.\nIf the movant succeeds in demonstrating the absence of a material issue of fact, the burden shifts to the non-\nmovant to establish, with evidence beyond the pleadings, that a genuine issue material to the non-movant's case\nexists. See Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir.1991); see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). A dispute\nof material fact \"is `genuine' ... if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\nnonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). If\nthe non-movant's response consists of nothing more than conclusory allegations, the court must enter summary\njudgment for the movant. See Peppers v. Coates, 887 F.2d 1493 (11th Cir.1989).\nII. FACTS\nThis is a strip-search case. Everyone who is put into a cell at the Lee County Jail is strip-searched first. Both\nsides have offered documents, as well as testimony of jail officials, about this official policy. In addition, testimony\nof the Plaintiffs themselves has been offered concerning their experience of being searched. As is required when\n\naddressing summary judgment, the court has viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant,\nPlaintiffs Magill and Hudmon.\nThe Jail's Policy.\n1384 Both sides draw upon the same testimony and evidence to establish the official policy of *1384 the Lee County\nJail regarding strip searches. Pursuant to Security Policy 7.05, adopted by the Lee County Sheriff on July 7,\n1993, everyone who is put into a cell at the Lee County Jail is strip-searched. Lee County Jail Security Policy\n7.05. The policy defines \"strip searches\" as searches \"during which an inmate is required to remove his clothing.\"\nId. The policy also sets the times at which strip searches are conducted, which include \"[a]fter an inmate who is\nhoused in the facility is booked, unless prohibited by law.\" Id. The policy further requires that the search be done\nby \"an officer of the same sex as the inmate\" and that the search be \"done in a manner that avoids unnecessary\nforce, embarrassment, or indignity to the inmate.\" Id. The searches are done in the interest of \"facility safety and\nsecurity.\" Id.\nSheriff Chapman has testified that he is responsible for the search policy in question. Chapman Depo. 4:22-5:9.\nHe does not seek warrants to do these searches because he \"believe[s] the law gives the sheriff the authority to\ncheck people that are coming in and out of a correctional facility for security purposes and contraband.\" Id. at\n11:10-21. Chapman defines a strip search as one which does not include stripping the inmate down to\nnakedness:\nQ. What is the definition of a strip search?\nA. Definition of a strip search is to strip the outer garments. Keep your hands off of the body parts.\nIf it's female, you do not make them take their brassiere off or their panties....\nQ. And that's your policy?\nA. That's the policy.\nId. at 14:1-11. Chapman goes on to specifically say that the policy only includes removing the outer clothes, and\nthat if an officer told an inmate to remove her underwear, that officer would be \"on [her] own if [she] d[id] that.\" Id.\nat 15:3-7.\nThe searches are done in a small room just off of the booking area, which has a long, thin window located in the\ndoor. Searches were done in this certain room with the knowledge and approval of the Sheriff. Id. at 8:8-11.\nSheriff Chapman says that there was no decision to put the window in the room, only that the facility was built\nthat way when he became Sheriff. Id. at 17:21-23. Officers try to block anyone from seeing in the window when\nthey do searches, by standing in front of it; it is, in fact, difficult for any person to peer through the window without\nstanding \"right up against it.\" Id. at 17:1-20.\nChief Deputy Cary Torbert, Jr. is the administrator of the Lee County Jail. Torbert Affid. He testified that the\n\"limited strip search\" is only performed on those \"who actually enter a jail cell,\" and is not performed on persons\n\"who have already obtained a bond for their release prior to their booking,\" or who are in the process of obtaining\na bond. Id. The Chief Deputy says that the inmates are required to remove \"only their outer clothing and their\n[1]\nshoes and socks.\" Id.  Torbert testified that any officer who ever told an inmate to remove anything other than\ntheir outer clothing would be \"acting directly contrary to jail policy and would be disciplined appropriately, if not\nterminated.\" Id. The searching officer is told to block the window when conducting the search, and a jail officer is\nalways on duty in the control room and could prohibit observation of the search. Id.\nChief Deputy Torbert says that the policy was instituted to prevent the introduction of small contraband into the\njail, such as drugs or weapons. Id. Torbert testified that the crime with which the inmate is charged is not a\nreliable indicator of the propensity to introduce contraband. Id. Rather, it is those addicted to drugs (not\nnecessarily those charged with drug offenses) who may try to introduce that contraband. Id. In addition, it is\n1385 \"often first time offenders or weaker offenders, *1385 which [sic] have heard horror stories of inmate violence,\nwho will try to smuggle in a weapon.\" Id. Once the contraband is inside the jail, it poses a threat to other inmates,\n\nas well as the inmate herself. Id. Torbert says that the decision to search those who are placed in holding cells\nwas made because they pose threats to themselves and other inmates in holding cells, and have contact with\nother inmates making it possible to introduce contraband into the general population. Id.\nTestimony from employees of the Sheriffs Department verified the Sheriff's and Torbert's interpretations of the\npolicy. Officer Glines testified that people who are taken into a cell are strip searched. Glines Depo. 40:23 00 41:4;\n97\n22:1-13. She further testified that when inmates are searched, they are put in a room that has an approximately 4\ninch ร 36 inch window in the door, which could make it possible for persons to see into the room. Id. at 41:10 00\n97\n43:1. Glines testified that she was trained to block the window with her back when conducting a strip search. Id.\nat 43:2-14. Ms. Reasor testified that she checks to make sure that the officer's back is at the window to verify that\nnothing is wrong. Id. at 33:14-19. Ms. Reasor was taught and believed that the process of strip-searching only\nincludes removing someone's outer clothes. Id. at 33:23 00 34:10.\n97\nThe Strip-searches of the Plaintiffs.\nThere are two plaintiffs in this case. Both were strip-searched prior to being placed in a cell at the Lee County\nJail.\nSharon Magill was strip-searched, down to her underwear, after being arrested for driving under the influence.\nHer description of the process echoes the testimony of the Lee County officials. When Ms. Magill was searched,\nthe officer never asked her to take off her undergarments. Magill Depo. 30:3-17. In addition, the search was\nconducted by a female officer with no one else in the room. Id. at 31:9-12. Magill asked the officer why she was\nundressing before a window and the officer moved in front of the window, but, according to Ms. Magill, did not\ncompletely block it. Id. at 31:13-22. The window was clear with metal wire in it. Id. at 33:13-16. In any event,\nhowever, Ms. Magill does not think that anyone came to the window. 35:3-6. Ms. Magill was offended because\n[2]\nthe officer could see through her undergarments. Id. at 38:4-16.  She testified that she was upset and crying\nthroughout the entire process. Id. 24:3-5.\nSherrer Hudmon was strip-searched when she was placed into a cell while her husband searched for someone to\nbond her release on bad-check charges. She testified that she stripped down naked when told to take off her\nclothes. S. Hudmon Depo. 65:9-15. Ms. Hudmon described the process after she took off her clothes: the female\nofficer\ntold me to pull up my hair. She told me to shake my head. She told me to open my mouth. She\ntold me to turn around. She told me to bend over. Then she told me I could put on my clothes.\nId. 67:2-6. No one else entered the room except for the female officer, and Ms. Hudmon was fully dressed before\n[3]\nleaving the room. Id. at 67:13-19.  Ms. Hudmon did not see anyone else peer into the room. Id. at 72:16 00 73:4.\n97\nMs. Hudmon was upset, crying, and \"scared to death\" during the entire seven-eight hours she spent at the jail,\n[4]\nparticularly after she was searched. Id. at 73:7 00 74:8.\n97\nIII. DISCUSSION\n1386 The court's discussion and decision in this case are affected by the status of the Defendants *1386 and Plaintiffs\nbefore it. The court is called upon to determine only one issue: whether the strip search policy of the Lee County\nJail is constitutional. The court determines that it is; thus, summary judgment for the Defendants is due to be\nGRANTED.\nPreliminary Note.\nThe only defendants who remain in this case are the Sheriff and Lee County, and the sole remaining claim\nagainst them is a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 claim for deprivation of the Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights against\nunreasonable searches, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 1983 is not a source of\n\nfederal rights. Rather, it is merely a means for vindicating constitutional and statutory rights, a means for an\ninjured party to sue state officials who infringe upon those rights. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S.Ct.\n807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994). In any ยง 1983 lawsuit, the plaintiff must initially show that she was \"deprived ... of a\nright secured under the Constitution or federal law\" in order to recover. Willis v. University Health Services, Inc.,\n[5]\n993 F.2d 837, 840 (11th Cir.1993), cert. den. 510 U.S. 976, 114 S.Ct. 468, 126 L.Ed.2d 420 (1993).  In this\ncase the issue is whether the Sheriff of Lee County violated these plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights in strip-\n[6]\nsearching them upon entry in the Lee County Jail.  The reasonableness of the search and its constitutionality\nare to be decided by the court as a question of law. Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th\nCir.1992); O'Neal v. DeKalb County, Ga., 850 F.2d 653, 657 n. 6 (1988), citing Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1,\n8, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).\nIn determining the constitutionality of the searches in this case, the court's job is made easier by the status of the\nDefendants. There is, of course, no respondeat superior liability under ยง 1983. Monell v. Dept. of Social Serv.,\n436 U.S. 658, 690-92, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); LaMarca v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1526, 1538 (11th\nCir.1993), cert. den., 510 U.S. 1164, 114 S.Ct. 1189, 127 L.Ed.2d 539 (1994). The Defendants sued here are not\nalleged to have personally participated in the searches; as a result, they could only be held liable if the searches\n1387 were *1387 unlawful and were taken pursuant to their official policy or custom. Monell, 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98\n[7]\nS.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); Ortega v. Christian, 85 F.3d 1521, 1526 (11th Cir.1996).  Since neither side\nhas presented evidence that the Defendants condoned violations of the policy, see Brown v. Crawford, 906 F.2d\n667, 671 (11th Cir.1990), cert. den. 500 U.S. 933, 111 S.Ct. 2056, 114 L.Ed.2d 461 (1991), the court must look\nonly to the official policy of the Lee County Jail and determine if that violates the Constitution.\nThe Fourth Amendment Rights of Pre-trial Detainees.\nIn determining the constitutionality of the searches at issue, the court must be mindful not only of the status of the\nDefendants in this case, but also the status of the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have challenged searches which were\nperformed on them while they were inmates at the Lee County Jail. Determining whether there is a constitutional\nviolation of the rights of someone confined in a jail, even as a pre-trial detainee, is different from determining\nwhether the rights of an unincarcerated individual have been violated. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 546, 99 S.Ct.\n1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Pre-trial detainees do not forfeit all of their constitutional rights at the jailhouse\ndoor. Id. at 545. Nevertheless, pre-trial detainees \"simply do[] not possess the full range of freedoms of an\nunincarcerated individual.\" Id. at 546. Rather, a detainee's rights must be balanced against \"[t]he fact of\nconfinement as well as the legitimate goals and policies of the penal institution.\" Id.\nThe court's job in this type of case is to seek a \"mutual accommodation\" between the detainee's rights and the\nrestrictions of jail. Id. All restrictions on inmate rights \"must be evaluated in light of the central objective of prison\nadministration, safeguarding institutional security.\" Id. at 547. Practices which prison officials think are needed to\npreserve order and security \"should be accorded wide-ranging deference.\" Id.\nStrip-searches of Pre-trial Detainees-the Legal Standard.\nIn this court's decision not to dismiss this case, the court carefully canvassed Eleventh Circuit law on the issue of\nstrip-searches. The court concluded that the law was somewhat undeveloped: \"The court agrees with the limited\nproposition that Bell and Peachtree City [Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11th Cir.1992)] do not\n1388 clearly establish [all] the law concerning when a *1388 strip-search of a lawfully detained adult violates the Fourth\nAmendment.\" Memorandum Opin. & Order at 15 (denying motion for dismissal), May 20, 1997. The court did say,\nhowever, that one proposition is clear, indeed clear enough to be a basis to deny qualified immunity. That\nproposition is that \"strip-searches of pretrial detainees must be based on legitimate objective concerns.\" Id. at\n17-18.\nIn other words, the government must establish some justification for undertaking a search. The test is somewhat\nof a balancing test: \"the more intrusive a search is upon personal rights, the more the government must\n\ndemonstrate justification for conducting the search.\" Peachtree City, 961 F.2d at 192. As stated by the Supreme\nCourt in Bell:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 559, citing United States v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606, 97 S.Ct. 1972, 52 L.Ed.2d 617 (1977); \nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976); United States v.\nBrignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868,\n20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967); Schmerber v.\nCalifornia, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966).\nThe \"law\" regarding strip-searches is, therefore, a balancing act. It tells the court not so much what the decision\nin this case should be, but how the court should consider the matter. The court is supposed to balance the\nlegitimate institutional concerns of security and safety of the Lee County Jail, against the rights of the Plaintiffs,\npre-trial detainees. In balancing these competing interests, the court should look to the scope, manner,\njustification, and place of the search in question.\nStrip-searches of Pre-trial Detainees-the Precedent.\nThe \"law\" leaves room for a rather open analysis centered around four factors. More enlightening to the ultimate\nresolution of this particular case are the precedents. Both Bell, the Supreme Court law on this issue, and \nPeachtree City, the Eleventh Circuit precedent, sustain strip-searches in similar contexts.\nBell concerned searches done on pre-trial detainees at a federal facility, which are actually more intrusive than\nthe present searches. 441 U.S. at 524. Inmates at the facility, just like inmates at all federal prison facilities, were\n\"required to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every\ncontact visit with a person from outside the institution.\" Id. at 558. The purpose of the strip / body cavity search\nwas \"not only to discover but also to deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other contraband.\" Id.\nIn determining the precise \"question whether visual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by the [jail] rules\ncan ever be conducted on less than probable cause,\" the Supreme Court was careful not to \"underestimate the\ndegree to which these searches may invade the personal privacy of inmates.\" Id. at 560. Nevertheless, the Court\nin its \"[b]alancing [of] the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy interests\nof the inmates,\" concluded that those searches could be done. Id. Particularly important to the Court were the\nunique and \"serious security dangers\" posed in jails. Id. at 559. The \"[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons and\nother contraband\" was observed to be \"all too common an occurrence .\" Id. The Court viewed the propensity of\ninmates to smuggle as a given-the fact that contraband had been found on only one inmate was viewed as a\n1389 \"testament to the effectiveness of this search technique as a *1389 deterrent,\" instead of a testament to the\nuselessness of the search. Id.\nThe Eleventh Circuit has also shed light on the issue of strip-searching pretrial detainees. Justice v. City of\nPeachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11th Cir.1992) involved a Lee County-type strip search (\"down to her panties\") of a\nfemale juvenile who was not even going to be put in a cell, but released to her parents upon arrival at the police\n[8]\nstation. Id. at 189-90.  The Eleventh Circuit noted that strip searches are indeed \"demeaning, dehumanizing,\nundignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\" \nId. at 192. In addition, the court noted that it was given particular pause when the strip search was \"of a juvenile\n[and] based on less than probable cause.\" Id. at 193. Nevertheless, the court upheld the search of the juvenile\narrestee:\n\nConsequently, we hold that law enforcement officers may conduct a strip search of a juvenile in\ncustody, even for a minor offense, based upon reasonable suspicion to believe that the juvenile is\nconcealing weapons or contraband.\nId. Peachtree City is not the most instructive case, given that it involves the strip-search of a minor who is not\neven going to be placed in a cell. Nevertheless, the Eleventh Circuit's sustaining of that search, as well as the\nSupreme Court's sustaining of the search in Bell, put the complaints of Ms. Magill and Ms. Hudmon in a certain\n[9]\ndifficult position.\nAnalysis of the Lee County Searches.\nAnalyzing the Lee County searches under the Bell factors, and in light of the decisions in Bell and Peachtree City,\nthis court has little difficulty sustaining the constitutionality of the searches. The Lee County Sheriff has\nundertaken only to conduct a limited strip search on all newly-incarcerated persons at the Jail, only those who will\nbe placed in a cell. Furthermore, the Sheriff is conducting this search in a reasonable and justified manner, and in\na reasonable place.\nJustification for the Searches. The searches performed on newly-incarcerated persons at the Lee County Jail are\ncertainly justified. The jailers have a difficult job to do: to protect their inmates from themselves, to protect other\ninmates, and to protect their officers, all the while maintaining order and an environment appropriate for\n[10]\nrehabilitation.  As noted by the Eleventh Circuit in Peachtree City, \"strip searches are valuable law\nenforcement tools in maintaining security.\" Id. at 193. This court does not underestimate the need for Lee County\nto provide a secure institution, and further, does not underestimate the dangers that contraband, such as drugs\nand weapons pose.\nThe newly-admitted detainees in this case are in a similar position to the inmates in Bell. Neither is yet convicted\n1390 of a crime, but both are entering (or re-entering) a prison institution after contact with the public. If *1390 the\nsearches in Bell are justified, the searches in this action are justified as well. Furthermore, the detainees in this\ncase are in a position to pose greater danger to the institution than was the detainee in Peachtree City. There, the\njuvenile was not even going to be placed into contact with the inmate population, yet the search was sustained.\nRather, the juvenile was going to be released to her parent after arriving at the jail; there was no threat to the\nsecurity of the institution.\nPlaintiffs have asked this court to hold the searches unconstitutional because the Defendants had no probable\ncause or reasonable suspicion for the search. In Peachtree City, the Eleventh Circuit appears to place some\nemphasis on the idea that the officer had \"reasonable suspicion\" for the search. Id. at 193-94. It is not certain\nfrom a fair reading of the opinion whether this requirement is present only because the case involved a juvenile\narrestee. Indeed, given that the juvenile in that case was not going to be placed in a cell, Peachtree is not exactly\npersuasive authority on this issue.\nIn any event, however, this court will not read the Eleventh Circuit's decision to require that some heightened\njustification be present for a jail official to search a new inmate before they are placed in lockup with other\nprisoners. In Peachtree City, the Eleventh Circuit noted that for institutions, the \"security dangers\" would be \"the\nsame whether the detainee is a juvenile or an adult.\" Id. at 193. This court would analogously note that the\nsecurity dangers posed to the Lee County Jail are as high for one inmate as for another, no matter the crime they\nare charged with. Even those who are only placed in a holding cell could pose dangers to themselves, other\ninmates, and the guards. Furthermore, they have contact with other general population inmates. In addition, the\nofficers have testified, in an uncontested manner, that the inmates who might at first glance appear to pose the\nleast threat may in fact pose the greatest because of their fear and potential threat to themselves. Searches of all\nnewly-admitted detainees who are going to be locked-up, and in contact with other prisoners, are justified.\nScope of the Searches. The searches in the present case are reasonable in scope as well. The Lee County\npolicy requires all newly admitted detainees to remove all of their outer clothing, and only their outer clothing.\nThis is a reasonable response given that small objects, such as pills, needles, or other contraband, can pose\n\ndifficult and dangerous situations for jail administrators. Ms. Hudmon testified, of course, that she removed all of\nher clothing including her underwear. Nevertheless, she could in no way link this to an official policy or custom of\nthe jail. Indeed, in her testimony she even appeared confused about the instructions that she was given by the\n[11]\nofficer.  In any case, however, the court is not basing its opinion on the Sheriff's decision to allow the inmates\nto keep on their underwear. The constitutional balancing of the inmate's rights and jail's concerns does not\nnecessarily turn on the issue of whether the inmates are allowed to wear a bra and panties.\nManner of the Searches. The searches at issue are also reasonable in manner. The Sheriff has specified that the\n1391 searches only be conducted by officers of the same sex as the inmate. Furthermore, the *1391 Sheriff and his\npolicies require that the searches be conducted in a manner to minimize the embarrassment to the inmates. The\ncourt is mindful that Ms. Magill and Ms. Hudmon were, despite these efforts, still embarrassed by the process.\nNevertheless, their particular emotional reactions do not determine the Constitutionality of these searches. In\nundertaking his duties as jailer, the Sheriff may infringe on the sensibilities of the inmates. Such infringement is to\nbe expected in a penal institution.\nPlaintiff has raised an objection because the inspections are conducted on everyone who enters the institution,\nand not just on those who pose some particular threat. In Peachtree City, the Eleventh Circuit appears to place at\nleast some emphasis on the idea that the strip search there is conducted \"in the least intrusive manner.\" Id. It is\nnot certain from the opinion whether the court is placing that requirement on the officers only because the\nsearched party is a juvenile, and only an arrestee. Indeed, if the Eleventh Circuit were meaning to place the\nrequirement on the Sheriff in a case such as this one, that ruling would appear to be contrary to the Supreme\nCourt. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559 n. 40, quoting United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 556-57, 96 S.Ct. 3074,\n49 L.Ed.2d 1116 n .12 (1976) (\"`[t]he logic of such elaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raise\ninsuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers'\").\nNevertheless, even if the Eleventh Circuit means for this requirement to be placed on searches of adult inmates,\nthe court would note that it believes the searches here were conducted by the least intrusive means. Use of a\nmere pat-down would not, as the Lee County officials noted, find small drugs or weapons. In addition, use of\nmetal detector would not find drugs or other non-metallic objects. In addition, the plaintiff has not explained how\nthe jail officials are supposed to determine who poses a more particularized threat to bring in a weapon or drugs\nor money, etc., so that only those people could be searched. Drug addicts may commit any number of crimes, so\nit would not make sense to search only drug offenders for such contraband. In addition, those who pose threats\n[12]\nto bring weapons apparently include first-time offenders.  It is a reasonable response to these threats for the\nSheriff to simply search everyone who enters the inmate population.\nPlace of the Searches. Plaintiff has also objected to the searches because of the place where they were\nperformed. The court has to admit that it was given some pause because of this issue at the dismissal stage,\nwhen the allegations were that an inmate was forced to undress naked in a room with a view. The facts, however,\nhave clarified these allegations to a great degree. Plaintiffs are, consistent with the policy, only being asked to\ntake their outer clothes off. Furthermore, neither Plaintiff here noticed an observer, and there is no evidence\nbefore the court that anyone has ever been allowed to observe the search other than the officer administering it.\nThe only evidence before the court regarding the window is that it was in the building when the searches started;\nthat the officers block it when a search is occurring; that it is difficult to peer through; and that a second officer\n1392 can see if anyone is *1392 peering through so as to stop them.[13] There is no reason not to conclude that it is a\nreasonable place to perform the searches in question.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe Supreme Court noted that searches could sometimes be abused, and that such abuse should not be\ncondoned. Bell, 441 U.S. at 560. In the present suit, however, the court is not asked to address whether there\nhas been abuse; rather, the court is only asked to determine if the official policy or custom of the Lee County Jail\nrequiring strip searches is unconstitutional. Balancing the rights of the inmates against the legitimate concerns of\nthe institution, the court finds the policy to be constitutional. If the Supreme Court can approve a strip search and\nbody cavity search procedure on detainees who have had a contact visit with the public, indeed a presumably\n\nsupervised contact visit with the public, surely this court must approve the present search. Likewise, if the\nEleventh Circuit can approve strip-searches of juveniles who are not even going to be placed into a cell, this court\nshould approve the present search. The Lee County search policy is a reasonable response to legitimate\n[14]\nconcerns.  Such a search, even if offensive to Ms. Magill and Ms. Hudmon, does not violate the Constitution.\n[1] Torbert testified that an inmate is only required to remove her underwear when there is a reasonable suspicion\nfor a body cavity search. Id. Torbert further testified that, to his knowledge, there has not been a body cavity\nsearch at the Lee County Jail. Id.\n[2] There are also some allegations that the officer put on a latex glove. Magill Depo. 30:3-8. For what purpose, is\nnot known. The glove was never used, however, so those allegations are meaningless.\n[3] Ms. Hudmon was also apparently upset by the search because she thought the officer appeared to be a\nlesbian. Hudmon Depo. 93:14 00 95:11. Since the Plaintiff has not linked this testimony in any way to an official\n97\npolicy or custom of the Sheriff, it is not necessary for the court to consider it.\n[4] Officer Reasor stated that one of the inmate/plaintiffs here \"probably was strip searched\" if she was in the jail\n\"for any kind of length of time,\" but not \"if she bonded out as soon as she got there.\" Reasor Depo. 12:21 00\n97\n13:11.\n[5] Plaintiff must also show that Defendants acted under color of state law. Here, that issue is not contested.\n[6] In this court's Memorandum Opinion & Order, May 20, 1997 (denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss), the\ncourt declined to analyze Plaintiff's claims under any other Constitutional provision. The Eighth Amendment\nclearly does not apply. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977) (\"the State does\nnot acquire the power to punish with which the Eighth Amendment is concerned until after it has secured a formal\nadjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law\"). If the court were to analyze this challenge under the\nEighth Amendment, it would be easy to dispose of. Under that analysis, the federal courts do not intervene unless\nthe \"strip searches ... are devoid of penological merit and imposed simply to inflict pain.\" Harris v. Ostrout, 65\nF.3d 912, 916 (11th Cir.1995) (granting summary judgment to defendant where policy was to \"strip search all\n`close management' prisoners ... before they leave their cells for any reason,\" and plaintiff had not presented any\nevidence to show policy was unreasonable or that searches were done for retaliatory reason), citing Turner v.\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 83-85, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). \nAlthough it is less clear that the due process clause does not apply, the court likewise declined to consider that\ntheory. The Supreme Court has said that \"[w]here the State seeks to impose punishment [prior to an adjudication\nof guilt], the pertinent constitutional guarantee is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id.430\nU.S. at 671-72 n. 40. Plaintiffs have not alleged that the strip searches here were done for the purpose of\npunishment, however, nor have they alleged that life, liberty or property were implicated by the searches. Bell\nmay, in fact, stand for the proposition that strip / body cavity searches performed after an inmate has contact with\nvisitors do not implicate due process. Bell, 441 U.S. at 560-61 (\"Nor do we think that the [searches, among other\nrestrictions] constitute `punishment' in violation of the rights of pretrial detainees under the Due Process Clause\nof the Fifth Amendment\"). Any substantive due process rights that may be at issue would probably only be\nredundant of the rights guaranteed by the more specific text of the Fourth Amendment. See Graham v. Connor,\n490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871 n. 10, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). At least, plaintiffs have not identified how they\nwould be different, so they will not be considered.\n[7] It goes without saying that the Defendants could only be held liable for an official policy or custom which is \ntheir official policy or custom. The Sheriff has admitted that he is responsible for the search policy. The County\ncontends that it is not liable for his search policy, since the County exerts no control or supervision over the\nSheriff, and is not responsible for the management of the jail and its policies. \nThere is a live debate whether an Alabama county may be held liable for the actions of the Sheriff as jailer. The\nSupreme Court recently decided that the county is not liable for the actions of the Sheriff when he is acting as a\nstate official, such as when he is investigating crime. McMillian v. Monroe County, Ala., ___ U.S. ___, 117 S.Ct.\n1734, 138 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997). That decision left open whether there are situations where the Sheriff may be\n\nviewed as a county official, (indeed maybe even a county policymaker), and the county would be liable for his\nactions. There is Eleventh Circuit authority for the proposition that the county may be liable for the Sheriff's\npersonnel policies or decisions. Parker v. Williams, 862 F.2d 1471 (11th Cir.1989). Although that decision may not\nbind this court to a decision that the county would be liable for the Sheriff's custodial and security policies, it could\nbe persuasive.\nIn any event, Parker has come under great scrutiny because of a well-reasoned opinion by Judge Propst of the\nNorthern District of Alabama. Turquitt v. Jefferson County, Ala., 929 F.Supp. 1451 (N.D.Ala.1996). Judge Propst\npointed out that later decisions of the Eleventh Circuit, decisions of the Alabama Supreme Court, and Parker's\nown interpretations of state law, make Parker a questionable decision. Judge Propst certified an appeal to the\nEleventh Circuit. Id. at 1455. See also McMillian v. Johnson, 88 F.3d 1573, 1585 (11th Cir.1996) (Propst,\nconcurring specially). The Eleventh Circuit granted that appeal, and has agreed to hear the case en banc. \nTurquitt v. Jefferson County, Ala., 102 F.3d 465 (11th Cir.1996).\n[8] This court relied on this case, in large part, in reaching its conclusion at the dismissal stage that the law is\nclearly established that the state must have a legitimate, objective basis for doing a strip search. Id. at 192 (\"The \nBell balancing test for reasonableness requires `at a minimum, that the facts upon which an intrusion is based be\ncapable of measurement against \"an objective standard,\" whether this be probable cause or a less stringent\ntest.'\").\n[9] Even if the court were not to hold that these searches are reasonable as a matter of law, the court would be\nreceptive to Defendant Chapman's arguments that he is entitled to qualified immunity for the claims against him\nin his individual capacity (the only claims which remain against the Sheriff). Indeed, the facts in this instance\ncould lead the court to the conclusion that qualified immunity is appropriate. See Lassiter v. Alabama A & M Univ.,\n28 F.3d 1146, 1150 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc) (\"For qualified immunity to be surrendered, pre-existing law must\ndictate, that is, truly compel (not just suggest or allow or raise a question about), the conclusion for every like-\nsituated, reasonable government agent that what defendant is doing violates federal law in the circumstances.\").\nQuestions about the Sheriff's qualified immunity need not be decided, however, since the court may decide as a\nmatter of law that the actions do not violate the constitution.\n[10] The Lee County Jail not only holds pre-trial detainees, but also those convicted of misdemeanors.\n[11]See Hudmon Depo. at 65:9 00 66:7:\n97\nQ. You were completely naked?\nA. Uh-huh (positive response).\nQ. And did she tell you to do that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. She said 00 Again, tell me her exact words.\n97\nA. Take off your clothes.\nQ. But did she specify take off both your outer garments and your underwear?\nA. She may have said that. I don't know. But I took all my clothes off. Now, I mean, she told me either to take\nthem all off, or it was 00 I mean, I knew what I was supposed to do because she told me what to do.\n97\nQ. When she said remove your clothes, you interpreted that to include your undergarments?\nA. Yes. That's what she meant, whether she said that specifically or whether it was implied. But she told me to\ntake off my clothes and I did.\n[12] The jail and its lawyers have even shown that if individual decisions were made on who to search, these two\nplaintiffs would be good candidates. Chief Deputy Torbert testified in his affidavit that it is often the first-time\noffender who is frightened enough by the prospect of jail to sneak in weapons. In addition, defendant has also\n\nargued in the motions that searches of the plaintiffs here would have been justified because the plaintiffs fit a\nsuicide profile: first-time offenders, very upset, etc. No testimony has been offered that the latter reason was the\njustification at the time that the search was conducted. It will not, therefore, be considered. New Jersey v. T.L.O.,\n469 U.S. 325, 341, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985), quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868,\n20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (\"[d]etermining the reasonableness of any search involves a twofold inquiry: first, one\nmust consider `whether the ... action was justified at its inception.'\").\n[13] Furthermore, the court would note that such a window would constitute a security measure itself. If an inmate\nwere to become hostile during the search, a second officer could observe the situation before entering the room.\n[14] The court is not expressing any opinion on whether the Sheriff was acting as an official policymaker for Lee\nCounty in this situation. The court need not address that question, nor does the court have to address the issue\nof qualified immunity.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
