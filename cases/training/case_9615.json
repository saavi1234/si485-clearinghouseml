In light of the recent decision/summary order from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Peebles believes that maybe the parties can discuss settlement options further. Parties report that they may set up a mediation session through an independent mediator from NYC. Plaintiff's counsel is not opposed to having an independent mediator, but has concerns w/ bringing someone up to speed w/ this case, which may be costly and time consuming. Judge believes that having an independent mediator might be beneficial to the parties and will leave it up to them to request a settlement conference w/ the court, if consented to. Parties will continue to explore this further. Plaintiff's counsel has issued a written demand. Defendants' counsel has issued a counter-proposal with two options proposed. Plaintiff's counsel has issued another settlement proposal on 11/22/05 and would like some clarification re: some of the issues contained w/in defendants' counter-proposal. Parties will continue this dialogue and will report on the status at the next telephone conference. Next telephone conference is scheduled for 12/7/05 at 3:00 PM.

    "summary": "<p>On April 29, 2003, a person represented by a group of  private attorneys from New York and D.C. law firms filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the North District of New York, challenging the jail admission policy of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department. The policy, known as a \"change-out\" procedure, required that each admittee to be placed in the Montgomery County Jail had to remove his/her clothes, shower and then change into jail garb, all while a corrections officer conducted a visual inspection of the admittee's naked body.  Plaintiff maintained that the \"change-out\" procedure amounted to an unconstitutional blanket strip search in violation of the Fourth Amendment, as it required all individuals to go through the procedure, regardless of the crime for which they were charged and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individuals were concealing weapons or contraband.  Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary and punitive damages, and class certification.  Defendants, the County and the Sheriff, answered by generally denying all allegations. </p><p>Years of intense litigation, extensive discovery and motion practice followed.  On March 25, 2005, the District Court (District Judge David N. Hurd) granted plaintiff's motion to certify the class and preliminarily enjoined defendants from using the change-out search procedure.  Defendants' motion for summary judgment was denied.  Judge Hurd also refused to allow defendants' insurance carrier to intervene in the case.  Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D. N.Y. 2005).   Defendants appealed and the Second Circuit affirmed.  Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 2005 WL 3117194 (2d Cir. Nov. 22, 2005).</p><p>After their attempt at summary judgment was denied, defendants moved to limit the plaintiffs' damages under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. 1997e(e), and moved to dismiss the claims against the Sheriff and County officials in their official capacity.  By order dated October 14, 2005, Judge  Hurd refused to apply the PLRA to the case, but dismissed the official capacity claims.  Claims against the individual defendants in their individual capacity remained, as did the claims against the County.  Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims for compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees was denied.  </p><p>Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment against the County and the Sheriff on the issue of liability and sought to make the Court's injunction permanent.  They also requested an award of interim attorneys' fees for plaintiffs' counsel.  Those motions were granted by Judge Hurd on April 12, 2006.  Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 426 F. Supp.2d 1 (N.D. N.Y. Apr 12, 2006).  That day, Judge Hurd also referred the case to Magistrate Judge David E. Peebles to make a final attempt at settlement.  After protracted negotiations, the case was settled.  </p><p>Under the Settlement Agreement approved by the Court on May 14, 2007, the County agreed to pay $2 million to settle all class claims.  Of that amount, $600,000 (30%) was awarded to class counsel, and administrative fees and bonuses to named plaintiffs were paid, leaving $1.3 million to pay class claims on a pro-rata basis.  Attorneys estimated 1650 class members existed and that each claimant would receive between $2000 and $3000 each.</p><p>We have no information indicating any post-settlement material activity occurred in the case.</p><p></p>",

Clerk ) \nUTICA \nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT \nAND JUDGMENT \nTHIS  CASE  coming for  hearing  before  the  undersigned  Judge  on  April  27,  2007, \npursuant to this Court's Preliminary Approval Order in order for this Court to conduct a final \nfairness hearing to determine whether the proposed Settlement Agreement between the parties is \nfair,  reasonable  and  adequate,  and  to  address  Class  Counsel's  application  for  an  award  of \nattorneys'  fees  and  costs;  and the  Class  Members  being represented  by  Class  Counsel  and \nDefendants being represented by their attorneys; \nAND THE COURT having read and considered the Settlement Agreement, the Notice \nPlan,  Plaintiffs'  Memoranda of Law  and  the  Supplemental  Affirmation  submitted  by  Class \nCounsel, having received evidence and heard arguments from Class Counsel and the Defendants, \nand  having  considered  the  submissions  by  Class  members,  now  makes  the  following \ndetermination: \n\nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1.  This action was commenced on April 29, 2003, as a class action. \n2.  After years  of intensive  litigation, including extensive discovery and motion practice \nbefore this Court, and including the granting of the Plaintiffs' motions for class certification, \npreliminary injunction, and partial summary judgment, and as a result of intensive, arm's length \nnegotiations  between  Class  Counsel  and  Defendants,  the  parties  have  reached  accord  with \nrespect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class Members, in return \nfor a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in this case against the Defendants (\"Settlement \nAgreement\").  The resulting Settlement Agreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on \nSeptember 22,2006. \n3.  As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a proposed \nNotice Plan and Class Notice, which provided Settlement Class Members notice of the proposed \nsettlement.  The Notice Plan provided an opportunity for class members to file objections to the \nSettlement. \n4.  As of the deadline for the filing of objections, only one objection was filed.  Given the \nsize of this Settlement, and the notice plan described above, this Court finds that the low number \nof objections is indicative of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement with \nthe Defendants. \n5.  Class Counsel has filed with the Court an affidavit from JoAnn Graff, Senior Project \nAdministrator of Rust Consulting, the Settlement Administrator, declaring that the mailing of the \nCourtยท approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan, has been completed.  The Plaintiffs have \nalso filed with the Court affidavits from lead counsel Elmer Keach and Dong He Chang, of I \n\nPartners,  the  Website  Administrator,  detailing  the  publishing  of the  short fonn  notice  and \nsettlement website, consistent with the Notice Plan, has been completed. \n6.  The Court finds that the published notice, mailed notice and Internet posting constitute \nthe best practicable notice of the Fairness Hearing, the proposed Settlement, Class Counsel's \napplication for fees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class Notice and the Short \nForm Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all members of \nthe Settlement Class, and complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, the laws of New York and any other \napplicable law. \n7.  Any persons who wished to be excluded from this Action were provided an opportunity \nto \"opt out\" pursuant to the Notice.  No members of the Settlement Class requested exclusion \nfrom the Settlement. \n8.  Class Members are  bound by the  Settlement, the  Settlement Agreement and releases \ncontained therein, and the Final Order and Judgment, and do not have any further opportunity to \nopt-out of the Action. \n9.  Any  class member who  did  not timely file  and  serve an  objection  in writing to  the \nSettlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiffs' Class Counsel's \napplication for fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Class \nNotice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed to \nhave waived any such objection by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise. \n10.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the Settlement \nAgreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable and adequate \ncompromise of the claims against the Defendant in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal \n\nRules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the Court has considered in \naffirming this Settlement, including: \n11.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \n12.  The Court notes that for settlement purposes, this Settlement has the benefit of providing \nrelief to  Class  Members  now,  without  further  litigation.  This  Settlement  provides  Class \nMembers with substantial monetary benefits. \n13.  This' Settlement is clearly a byproduct of hard-fought litigation between the parties, and \nnot a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counselor Counsel for the Defendants. \n14.  Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendants their application for \nreasonable  attorneys'  fees,  costs,  and  expenses  consistent with  the  terms  of the  Settlement \nAgreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request and hereby grants the request. \n15.  The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair,  a simplified \nprocess,  and  workable.  In  any  event,  the  Court  will  retain jurisdiction  to  work  out  any \nunanticipated problems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT, \nTHE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n16.  This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this proceeding. \n17.  Pursuant to Rule 23  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following Settlement \nClass is certified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll persons in the United States who have been or will be placed into the custody \nof  the  Montgomery  County  Jail  after  being  charged  with  misdemeanors, \nviolations,  violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions or other minor \ncrimes, or held on civil matters, and were strip searched upon their entry into the \nMontgomery  County  Jail  pursuant to  the  policy,  custom  and  practice  of the \nMontgomery County Sheriffs Department and the County of Montgomery.  The \nclass period commenced on April 29, 2000 and extended until March 25, 2005. \nSpecifically excluded from  the prop0sed class  are  Defendants,  and  all  of the \nrespective  affiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or \n\nasslgnees. \n18.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule 23 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a Class Action is  an appropriate \nmethod for resolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for Class certification \nunder Rule 23 are present.  The Class members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined. \nQuestions of law and fact common to all Class members predominate over individual issues and \nshould  be  determined  in  one  proceeding  with  respect  to  all  Class  members.  The  Class \nRepresentatives'  claims  are  typical  of those  of the  Class.  The  Class  action  mechanism  is \nsuperior to alternative means for adjudicating and resolving this action. \n19.  The Class Representatives Paul Marriott, Barbara Davis and Andy Rivera are entitled to \nand are hereby awarded payments of $12,500, $15,000, and $7,500, respectively, in recognition \nof the efforts they undertook in connection with this lawsuit. \n20.  The Court grants final approval of the Settlement Agreement, as being fair, reasonable \nand adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n21.  The Courts finds that the request by Class Counsel for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses \nis reasonable. \n, NOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT \nAND  CONCLUSIONS  OF  LAW,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED,  ADJUDGED  AND \nDECREED AS FOLLOWS: \n22.  The Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed Settlement is GRANTED. \n23.

This is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights secured to\nthe Plaintiffs and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States\nof America.  For at least the past five years, the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department has had\na policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the Montgomery County Jail and booked into\nthe facility, regardless of reasonable suspicion.  Upon information and belief, this policy is derived\nfrom the written procedures of the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department, and was promulgated\nby senior Department officials; specifically, Defendants Sheriff Michael Amato, Undersheriffs\nKevin Snell and Jeffrey Smith, Jail Administrator John Pecora, and Corrections Lieutenant Sue\nBuddles.   \n2. It has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals charged\nwith misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized reasonable suspicion\nthat they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of Montgomery County and the\nMontgomery County Sheriffโs Department to force those charged with minor crimes to undergo the\nindignities of a strip search upon entry into the Montgomery County Jail is not only clearly illegal,\nbut is insensitive and unnecessary.  \n3. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class of thousands of\nothers who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and\nunnecessary violation of their civil rights and those of the class members they propose to represent.\nThey seek monetary damages for themselves and each member of the proposed class, a declaration\nthat  the  Sheriffโs  Departmentโs  policies  are  unconstitutional,  and  an  injunction  precluding\nMontgomery County and the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department from continuing to violate\n2\n\nthe rights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiffs complain as\nfollows:\nJURISDICTION\n4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331, 1341\n& 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief\nfor the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured by\nthe Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1981 & 1983.  This Court also has\njurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ยง2201, as it is filed to obtain\ndeclaratory relief relative to the Constitutionality of the policies of a local government.\n5. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to Plaintiffsโ\nclaims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district.\nPARTIES\n6. Plaintiff Paul Marriott (โMarriottโ) is 37 years old and resides in Montgomery County.  On\nor about September 13, 2001, Marriott was arrested and placed in the Montgomery County Jail on\ncharges of Failure to Provide Proper Sustenance (failure to feed and water horses), a misdemeanor\nunder New Yorkโs Agricultural and Markets Law.\n7. Plaintiff Barbara Davis is 50 years old and resides in Montgomery County.  On May 2, 2001,\nMs. Davis was arrested on a Family Court civil warrant, and booked into the Montgomery County\nJail.\n8.

On June 1,\n2004,  Mr. Rivera was arrested for aggravated harassment in the second degree, a misdemeanor.\nPresently, Mr. Rivera is the subject of an order of protection to have no contact with another\n3\n\nindividual.    \n9. Defendant County of Montgomery (the โCountyโ) is a county government organized and\nexisting under the laws of the State of New York.  At all times relevant hereto, the County, acting\nthrough  its  Sheriffโs  Department,  was  responsible  for  the  policies,  practices,  supervision,\nimplementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Montgomery County Jail and was\nresponsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriffโs Department\npersonnel, including those working in the Montgomery County Jail.  In addition, at all relevant\ntimes, the County was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Montgomery County Jail, and for\nensuring that Sheriffโs Department personnel employed in the Jail obeyed the Constitution and laws\nof the United States and of the State of New York.\n10. Defendant Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department (the โSheriffโs Departmentโ) is a\nCounty Sheriffโs Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York.  At\nall times relevant hereto, the Sheriffโs Department was responsible for operating, organizing,\noverseeing and administering the Montgomery County Jail (โMCJโ).

Lieutenant Buddlesโ\nprincipal place of business is the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department, 200 Clark Drive, P.\nO. Box 432, Fultonville, NY  12072.  Lieutenant Buddles is made a Defendant in this action in both\nher individual and official capacities.\n16. Collectively, Sheriff Amato, Undersheriff Smith, Kevin Snell, Jail Administrator Pecora and\nLieutenant Buddles will be referred to as the โPolicy Making Defendants.โ\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n17. Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals who\nwere charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry into the\nMontgomery County Jail.\n6\n\n18. The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows:\nAll persons in the United States who have been or will be placed into the custody of\nthe Montgomery County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations,\nviolations of probation or parole, traffic infractions or other minor crimes, or held on\ncivil  matters,  and  were  or  will  be  strip  searched  upon  their  entry  into  the\nMontgomery  County  Jail  pursuant  to  the  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the\nMontgomery County Sheriffโs Department and the County of Montgomery.  The\nclass period commences on April 29, 2000, and extends to the date on which the\nMontgomery County Sheriffโs Department and/or the County of Montgomery are\nenjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice\nand custom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion.\nSpecifically excluded from the proposed class are Defendants, and all of their\nrespective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.\n19. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under Federal\nlaw  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and  adequacy  requirements  for\nmaintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).\n20. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  Upon\ninformation and belief, there are scores of people arrested for misdemeanors and violations who are\nplaced into the custody of the Montgomery County Jail every month โ all whom are members of the\nproposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed class totals at least 2,000\nindividuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions.\n21. Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable because of\nthe large number of class members and the fact that class members are likely dispersed over a large\ngeographical area, with some members presently residing outside of Montgomery County and this\nJudicial District.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many members of the class are low-\nincome persons, may not speak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their\nrights individually.\n22. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that they all had\n7\n\ntheir right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendantsโ conducting strip searches\nabsent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were charged with misdemeanors or\nviolations when placed into the custody of the Montgomery County Jail, and all were illegally strip\nsearched in violation of the clearly established law in this judicial circuit.\n23. Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiffs and all\nmembers of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendantsโ course of conduct.  The harms\nsuffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the class members.\n24. The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this action\nand will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiffs have no interests that are\nadverse to the interests of the members of the Class.\n25. Plaintiffs  have  retained  counsel  who  has  substantial  experience  and  success  in  the\nprosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiffs are being represented\nby Elmer Robert Keach, III; Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger of Berenbaum Menken Ben-Asher\n& Bierman, LLP; and Gary E. Mason and Charles Schneider of The Mason Law Firm, PLLC.  Mr.\nKeach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who has litigated a wide variety of\ncivil rights actions before this Court, and has litigated class action lawsuits in state and federal courts\nin seven states.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated strip search cases against the Troy City Police\nDepartment and the Schenectady City School District, and has previously litigated several other\ncases relating to police and corrections misconduct before this Judicial District.\n26. Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger are both experienced civil rights attorneys from New York\nCity, having litigated scores of civil rights cases against a number of Defendants, including one\nprison brutality case presently pending  in this District.  Mr. Menken and Mr. Rozger have\n8\n\nsuccessfully represented many victims of illegal strip searches, including several who opted out of\nthe recent class action litigation against the City of New York.\n27. Gary E. Mason is one of this countryโs premier class action attorneys, with offices in\nWashington, DC.  Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against Fortune 500 companies\nin both state and federal court in over a dozen jurisdictions, including gaining a settlement for a class\nof purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of $ 950 million dollars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead\nor co-counsel in numerous high profile class actions, including In Re The Exxon Valdez, In Re Diet\nDrugs Product Liability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation.\nIn addition to his extensive experience as a class action and environmental lawyer, Charles\nSchneider of the Mason Law Firm is a former trial attorney with the U.S. Department of Justiceโs\nCivil  Rights  Division  and  has  successfully  litigated  a  series  of  cases  involving  corrections\nmisconduct.\n28. All three firms representing the Plaintiffs in this action are presently prosecuting a similar\nclass action before this Court, for which a preliminary settlement has been approved; Kahler v.\nCounty of Rensselaer, et. al., No. 02-CV-1324 (TJM/DRH). \n29. In short, Plaintiffsโ counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to successfully\nprosecute this action against Montgomery County, the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department,\nand the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiffs knows of no conflicts among members\nof the class, or between counsel and members of the class.\n30. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiffs seek class\ncertification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members were subject to the same policy\nrequiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged with misdemeanor or minor crimes and\n9\n\nplaced into the custody of the Montgomery County Jail.  In short, the County of Montgomery, the\nMontgomery County Sheriffโs Department and the Policy Making Defendants acted on grounds\ngenerally applicable to all class members.\n31. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiffs seek\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3).  \n32. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and predominate\nover any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These common questions of\nlaw and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate question of whether the\nDefendantsโ  written  and/or  de  facto  policy  of  strip  searching  all  individuals  charged  with\nmisdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Montgomery County Jail is a violation of the\nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written\nand/or de facto policy existed during the class period.\n33. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication\nof this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the class is impracticable given\nthe large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a large geographical\narea.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would make it difficult or\nimpossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the\nfederal  court  system  of  adjudicating  thousands  of  individual  cases  would  be  enormous.\nIndividualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court\nsystem.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer\nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and protects\nthe rights of each member of the Class.\n10\n\n34. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the Defendantsโ\nflagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though the Defendants have\nmaintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the past five years, with the practice being\ndeclared unconstitutional in this judicial circuit in 1986.\n35. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also seek partial\ncertification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).\n36. Finally, Plaintiffs seek the certification of a limited fund class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\nP.  23(b)(1)(B)  for  the  purposes  of  assessing  punitive  damages  against  the  Policy  Making\nDefendants.  The prohibition against strip searching individuals charged with misdemeanors and\nother minor crimes has been established in this judicial circuit for over ten years, and with good\nreason:  Subjecting someone to the indignity of a strip search is only appropriate where there is some\ncause to believe that the individual possesses weapons or contraband.  \n37. This action is the textbook example of when punitive damages should be imposed on those\nin charge of a local correctional facility.  The Policy Making Defendants, however, have limited\npersonal assets; assets that would quickly be exhausted upon the imposition of punitive damages in\nonly a few cases.  As all members of the proposed class deserve to equally share in the assets of the\nPolicy Making Defendants, the certification of a limited fund punitive damages class is appropriate,\nwith the Court, after verdict, to establish this limited fund from the liquidated assets of the Policy\nMaking Defendants and distribute the fund to all members of the class.   \nFACTS\nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally\n38. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, such as\n11\n\nthe Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they supervise, from\nperforming strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor\ncrimes unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon\nor contraband.\n39. Upon information and belief, the County of Montgomery, the Montgomery County Sheriffโs\nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy,\ncustom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Montgomery\nCounty Jail, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband.\n40. Upon information and belief, the County of Montgomery, the Montgomery County Sheriffโs\nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy,\ncustom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Montgomery\nCounty Jail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime. \n41. The County of Montgomery, the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department, and the Policy\nMaking Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy or\npractice of conducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion.  This judicial\ncircuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may not strip search individuals charged with\nmisdemeanors or violations absent particularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle being\nclearly established in 1986 by Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986).  \n42. The Defendantsโ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating wholesale\nstrip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been promulgated, effectuated and/or\nenforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law.\n12\n\n43. Upon information and belief, not only is the policy of strip searching illegal, but the manner\nin which individuals are searched is also impermissible.  For example, upon information and belief,\nindividuals are strip searched in the presence of corrections officers, jail employees and arrestees\nof the opposite gender.  The are also strip searched and forced to shower in a room with a clear\nwindow, where anyone, regardless of gender or classification, can look inside.\n44.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the particular\ncircumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the particular\ncharacteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\n45. Upon information and belief, the County of Montgomery, the Montgomery County Sheriffโs\nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or\nfailed to rectify a policy, practice or custom of strip searching all individuals placed into the custody\nof the Montgomery County Jail without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed\nsuspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial\ndetainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor\nthe circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and\ncustom of routine strip searches.  \n46. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, including the\nnamed Plaintiffs, were victims of a routine strip search upon their entry into the Montgomery\nCounty Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of reasonable\nsuspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion. \n47. The strip searches in question largely occurred in the shower area of the Montgomery County\nJail booking room.  Upon information and belief, individuals are made to enter this shower room,\n13\n\nand there are strip searched and made to take a shower while being watched by a Corrections\nOfficer.    \n48. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to this\nwritten and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches โ each member of the class,\nincluding the named Plaintiffs โ have suffered or will suffer psychological pain, humiliation,\nsuffering and mental anguish.\nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \n49. Mr. Marriottโs experience is representative.  On or about September 13, 2001, Paul Marriott\nwas charged with Failure to Provide Proper Sustenance, a misdemeanor under New Yorkโs\nAgriculture and Markets Law.  The allegations underlying Mr. Marriottโs criminal charges were that\nhe failed to properly feed and water five horses.  The charges pending against Mr. Marriott were\nresolved with an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal.  Mr. Marriott is presently 38 years old.\n50. At approximately 8:00 PM on September 13, 2001, Mr. Marriott was transported to the\nMontgomery County Jail.  Soon thereafter, Mr. Marriott was moved into the shower area in the MCJ\nbooking room.  Mr. Marriott was ordered to remove his clothing and take a shower while a\nCorrections Officer watched.  \n51. The Corrections Officer then entered the shower room while Mr. Marriott was in a state of\ncomplete undress, inspected his clothing, and then administered a strip search.  The Officer forced\nMr. Marriott to bend over and spread the lobes of his buttocks for a visual examination.  Mr.\nMarriott was then issued jail clothing, namely, an orange jumpsuit.  \n52. Mr. Marriott was bailed out of the Montgomery County Jail the following morning, and his\ncharges were disposed of with an Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal.\n14\n\n53. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Marriott\nwas concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Marriott that\ncould have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, because Mr. Marriott had\nalready been in the custody of Deputies from the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department, the\nCorrections Officers in question knew or should have known that Mr. Marriott had already been\nsubjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed any weapons or contraband.\n54. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to County\nand Sheriffโs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Marriott has suffered and continues to\nsuffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\n55. Ms. Davisโ experience is also representative.  On May 2nd, 2001, she was arrested at her\nhome by Amsterdam Police officers after she missed a court date in Family Court.  \n56. Upon information and belief, she was not arrested for a criminal offense, but on a civil\nFamily Court warrant.  \n57. Ms. Davis was taken to Family Court, where the judge told her that she would not be\nreleased until she paid $2000.00 of the child support that she owed.  \n58. Ms. Davis was taken from Family Court to the Montgomery County Jail.  After arriving, and\nbeing asked questions by the desk officer, she was taken to a room with a shower. \n59. A female corrections officer ordered her to remove all of her clothing, and told her to take\na shower.  That officer watched Ms. Davis take the shower.  \n60. After Ms. Davis showered, and while she was completely naked, the officer ordered her to\nlift up her arms, open her mouth, and to bend over in front of the officer and spread the lobes of her\nbuttocks.  Ms. Davis complied with the officerโs orders. \n15\n\n61. Ms. Davis was released from the MCJ three days later when her brother posted the money\nfor her.  \n62. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Ms. Davis was\nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Ms. Davis that could\nhave given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, because Ms. Davis had already\nbeen in the custody of officers of the Amsterdam Police Department, the Corrections Officers in\nquestion knew or should have known that Ms. Davis had already been subjected to a search incident\nto arrest that would have revealed any weapons or contraband.\n63. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to County\nand Sheriffโs Department policy, practice and custom, Ms. Davis has suffered and continues to\nsuffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\n64. Andy Riveraโs experience is also representative.  On June 1, 2004, Mr.  Rivera was brought\nto the Montgomery County Jail as a pre-trial detainee, charged with aggravated harassment in the\nsecond degree, a misdemeanor.    \n65. After he was fingerprinted, Mr. Rivera was taken by a corrections officer to a room with a\nshower.  The corrections officer ordered Mr. Rivera to remove all of his clothing, including his\nunderwear.  The corrections officer watched Mr. Rivera remove his underwear, examined his naked\nbody, and told him to take a shower. \n66. Mr. Rivera obeyed the orders of the corrections officer to disrobe.  The corrections officer\nspecifically ordered him to remove his underpants. \n67. Following the aforementioned strip search, Mr. Rivera put on a jail uniform.  He was not\nallowed to keep any of the clothes he had been wearing.\n16\n\n68. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Rivera was\nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Rivera that could\nhave given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion, and the MCJ officers knew or should have\nknown that he had been the subject of a search incident to arrest that would have revealed any\ncontraband.  \n69. Without stating or implying that Mr. Rivera is a habitual criminal, Mr. Rivera has been\narrested on a number of occasions in the past, both in Amsterdam, New York and in New York City.\nAdditionally, there is an order of protection in place between Mr. Rivera and the alleged victim of\nhis crime that will be in place until 2007.  Consequently, there is a possibility beyond mere\nspeculation that Mr. Rivera will be rearrested in the future, making it likely that he will again be\nsubjected to the same illegal strip search procedure.\n70. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to County\nand Sheriffโs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Rivera has suffered and continues to\nsuffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\nCAUSES OF ACTION\nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law\n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid\nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law --\n71. Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation  stated  in\nparagraphs 1 through 69.\n72. The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  protects  citizens  from\n17\n\nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip\nsearches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent some particularized suspicion\nthat the individual in question has either contraband or weapons.\n73. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffsโ rights under the United States\nConstitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Montgomery County Corrections\nOfficers to strip search Plaintiff and class members based on their arrests for misdemeanor/violation\ncharges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making Defendants to order/direct\nMontgomery County Corrections Officers to conduct such searches.  \n74. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of the County\nof Montgomery and the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department.  As such, the County of\nMontgomery and the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department are directly liable for the damages\nof the named Plaintiff and members of the Class.\n75. Upon  information  and  belief,  Sheriff  Amato,  Undersheriff  Smith,  Kevin  Snell,  Jail\nAdministrator Pecora and Lieutenant Buddles are responsible for establishing the policies and\nprocedures to be utilized in the operation of the Montgomery County Jail, and are responsible for\nthe implementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Amato, Smith,\nSnell, Pecora and Buddles are each individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff\nand members of the Class.   \n76. Sheriff Amato, Undersheriff Smith, Kevin Snell, Jail Administrator Pecora and Lieutenant\nBuddles knew that the MCJโs strip search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and\nwith specific intent to deprive Plaintiff and members of the Class of their Constitutional rights.\n77. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, given\n18\n\nthat their actions were undertaken under color of state law.\n78. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiffs have\nbeen irreparably injured.\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n79. Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation  stated  in\nparagraphs 1 through 78.\n80. The policy, custom and practice of the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department, the\nCounty of Montgomery and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that these\nentities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the\nMontgomery County Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have\neither contraband or weapons.\n81. Plaintiffs and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory judgment, and\nthat it declare the strip search policy of the County of Montgomery and the Montgomery County\nSheriffโs Department to be unconstitutional.\nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction โ\n82.  Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation  stated in\nparagraphs 1 through 81.\n83. The policy, custom and practice of the Montgomery County Sheriffโs Department, the\nCounty of Montgomery and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that these\nentities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the\n19\n\nMontgomery County Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have\neither contraband or weapons.\n84. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Montgomery County Jail,\nwith new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have already\nbeen inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs.  \n85. The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor crimes (or no crime\nat all) will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, an adequate\nremedy for which does not exist at law.\n86. Plaintiffs demand that the County of Montgomery, the Montgomery County Sheriffโs\nDepartment,  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  and  Montgomery  County  Corrections  Officers\nimmediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of the Montgomery\nCounty  Jail  absent  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either\ncontraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court\nordering as much.\nAS AND FOR A FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DEFENDANTS COUNTY\nOF MONTGOMERY, THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SHERIFFโS DEPARTMENT,\nMICHAEL AMATO, JEFFREY SMITH, KEVIN SNELL, JOHN PECORA AND SUE\nBUDDLES\n--  Deliberate Indifference to Training and Supervision --\n87. Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  and  realleges  each  and  every  allegation  stated  in\nparagraphs 1 through 86.\n88. The above-named Defendants were deliberately indifferent in the training and supervision\nof the individual corrections officers employed at the Montgomery County Jail, in that Defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent in discharging their duty to make sure that any strip searches conducted\n20\n\nat the Montgomery County Jail were performed only in circumstances permitted by the United\nStates Constitution.\n89. The above-named Defendants knew, or should have known, that unconstitutional strip\nsearches were, or were likely to be, taking place in the Montgomery County Jail.\n90. Despite  this  knowledge,  the  above-named  Defendants  did  not  act  to  stop  these\nunconstitutional practices from occurring.\n91. This conduct on the part of the above-named Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C.\nยง 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law.\n92. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiffs have\nbeen irreparably injured.\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n93.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that they\ncontinue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a fact that their\nactions are unconstitutional.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to punish\nthe Policy Making Defendants.\nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY\n94. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of a class of others similarly\nsituated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief:\n1)  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.\n21\n\n2)  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffโs First Cause of Action\ndetailed herein, awarding Compensatory Damages to the named Plaintiff and each member of the\nproposed class.  Plaintiffs request, at a minimum, that they and the members of the class be awarded\n$200,000 for each time they were illegally strip searched by Defendants.  With the size of the Class\nestimated to be 2,000 individuals, the Plaintiffs request that the total judgment awarded to the Class\nbe no less than $ 400,000,000.00.\n3)    A  judgment  against  Defendant  Michael  Amato  on  Plaintiffsโ  First  Cause  of  Action  for\n$1,000,000.00 in punitive damages.\n3)    A  judgment  against  Defendant  Jeffrey  Smith  on  Plaintiffsโ  First  Cause  of  Action  for\n$1,000,000.00 in punitive damages.\n4)  A judgment against Defendant Kevin Snell on Plaintiffsโ First Cause of Action for $1,000,000.00\nin punitive damages.\n5)  A judgment against Defendant John Pecora on Plaintiffsโ First Cause of Action for $1,000,000.00\nin punitive damages.\n6)    A  judgment  against  Defendant  Sue  Buddles  on  Plaintiffsโ  First  Cause  of  Action  for\n$1,000,000.00 in punitive damages.\n7)  A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the County of Montgomery and the\nMontgomery County Sheriffโs Departmentโs policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity\nsearching all detainees entering the Montgomery County Jail, regardless of the crime charged or\nsuspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper.\n8)  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from continuing to strip and visual\ncavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole,\n22\n\ntraffic infractions or other minor crimes, or held on civil matters absent particularized, reasonable\nsuspicion that the arrestee subjected to the search is concealing weapons or other contraband.\n9)  A monetary award for attorneyโs fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988;\nRespectfully submitted by:\nDated: September 10, 2004 ______________________________\nAlbany, NY\nJason J.

Plaintiffโs counsel\nshall be permitted to conduct an inspection of the booking room, and\nshower and storage area, of the Montgomery County Jail, and to\nvideotape that inspection.  The inspection shall be limited in duration to\none hour, and no more than five persons, excluding the videographer,\nshall participate in the inspection on the behalf of the plaintiff.

FRANCOEUR, ESQ. \nEDELMAN & DICKER, LLP  THERESA MARANGAS, ESQ. \n150 East 42nd Street \nNew York, New York 10017-5639 \nDAVID E. PEEBLES \nU.S. MAGISTRATE JUDGE \nORDER \nCurrently pending before the court in this civil rights suit, which is \nstyled as a class action though no class certification motion has yet been \n\nmade, is an application by the plaintiff for an order compelling discovery. \nIn his motion, plaintiff seeks information concerning pretrial detainees held \nat the Montgomery County Jail on misdemeanor or less severe charges \nfrom April of 2000 to the present.1  Defendants vigorously oppose that \nrequest, asserting both lack of relevance to the claims and defenses in the \naction and the privacy concerns associated with the requested \ninformation, and urge the court to instead consider alternative means for \nallowing the plaintiff to contact potential witnesses or class members \nincluding to allow defendants' counsel to initiate the contact and inquire \nwhether the detainees are willing to participate in some fashion in this \nThe precise text of the request under consideration seeks \n[a]1I booking sheets, inmate admission records, \nsuicide screening forms, classification sheets, \npersonal appearance forms, property sheets, \ndocuments memorializing conversations \nbetween detainees and MCJ employees, and \nany documents containing the names, \naddresses [sic] offense charged, date of arrest, \ndate of arrival at the MCJ, telephone numbers \nand emergency contact information for all pre \ntrial detainees charged with misdemeanors, \nviolations, violation of parole, violation of \nprobation, or held on civil or family court \nmatters, conducted at the Montgomery County \nJail (\"MCJ\") from April of 2000 to the present. \nBruce E. Menkin, Esq. Letter Dated December 4,2003 (Dkt. No. 31) Exh. A, p. 4 \n2 \n\naction.2 \nOral argument concerning plaintiff's motion was conducted on \nDecember 18, 2003.  During oral argument I advised the parties that I did \nnot find any basis to conclude that the identity and charges associated \nwith most if not all pretrial detainees was inherently private, particularly in \nview of the fact that such information usually is publicly available.  I did \nacknowledge, however, privacy concerns with respect to some of the \nother information sought including, notably, social security numbers and \ndates of birth, ~~ concluded that those privacy considerations were \noutweighed in t~ instance by the potential relevance of the information \nsought and could be adequately addressed through the issuance of a \nprotective order.  At the conclusion of the motion hearing a decision, \nwhich is incorporated herein by reference, was rendered orally from the \nbench granting plaintiff's application subject to certain stated conditions. \nThe court having carefully reviewed the submissions of the parties \n2 \nDuring the  . co  ery hearing I noted that in his reply letter brief, dated \nDecember 16, 2003,  aintiff raised, without first seeking permission, additional \ndiscovery issues.  T  se issues were responded to by letter submission sent by \ndefendants' counsel  ecember 17, 2003, also without court permission.  That portion \nof plaintiff's reply let er addressing discovery issues unrelated to that which the hearing \nwas intended to address, and defendants' submission dated December 17, 2003 in its \nentirety, are hereby rejected and the parties are reminded of the court's established \npractice of requiring permission for submission of materials pertaining to any discovery \ndisputes. \n3 \n\nand the arguments contained therein, as well as the various authorities \ncited including, inter alia, Burka v. New York City Transit Authority, 110 \nF.R.D. 660 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) and Lora v. Board of Education, 74 F.R.D. \n565 (E.D.N.Y. 1977), and upon due deliberation, it is hereby \nORDERED as follows: \n1)  Plaintiff's motion to compel discovery is conditionally granted. \n2)  Within sixty (60) days of the date of this order, provided that a \nconfidentiality order as set forth below has been entered prior to that date, \ndefendants shall produce to plaintiff's counsel the name, address, social \nsecurity number, date of birth, next of kin telephone number, offense \ncharged, date of arrest, and day of arrival at the Montgomery County Jail \nfrom April of 2000 to the present for all pretrial detainees charged with \nmisdemeanors, violations, violation of parole, violation of probation, or \nheld on civil or family court matters. \n3)  At defendants' option, the information required above may be \nprovided by producing either inmate booking sheets associated with such \ndetainees, redacted to exclude all other information aside from that \nreferenced herein or, in the alternative, a summary chart containing the \ninformation as derived by booking sheets and other available sources of \ninformation.  Any such chart shall be signed by counsel pursuant to Rule \n4 \n\n11  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n4)  The production requirement set forth herein is conditioned \nupon the prior entry of a protective order pursuant to Rule 26(c) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, either on stipulation or, if the parties \ncannot agree, by the court restricting access to the information disclosed \npursuant to this order to attorneys for the parties and those employees \nand agents working directly with the attorneys, for use only in connection \nwith this action, and further providing that any person to whom information \nprovided under this order is disclosed must sign a statement agreeing to \nbe bound by the confidentiality order, and that plaintiff's counsel must \nmaintain a list of all persons to whom the information has been distributed. \n5)  That the clerk is directed to promptly forward copies of this \norder to counsel for the parties to this action. \nDavid E.  eebles \nU.S. Magistrate Judge \nDated:  December 23, 2003 \nSyracuse, New York \nG :\\Civil\\2003\\03-CV- 0531 \\order3. wpd \n5 ",

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Paul Marriott (\"Marriott\") filed this action individually and on behalf of a \nclass of others similarly situated alleging that the policy of the Montgomery County Jail (\"the \nJail\") providing for the search of all admittees constitutes a strip search in violation of the \nConstitution of the United States.  An amended complaint was filed on October 4,2004, with \nthe consent of all parties.  The amended complaint included two additional plaintiffs, Barbara \nDavis (\"Davis\") and Andy Rivera (\"Rivera\"). \nPlaintiffs moved to certify the class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and for a \npreliminary injunction.  Defendants opposed and cross moved for summary judgment. \nPlaintiffs opposed the cross motion. \n- 2 -\n\nDefendants appealed the July 7, 2004, Order of Hon. David E. Peebles, United \nStates Magistrate Judge, compelling the production of two letters dated March 26, 2004, and \none letter dated April 20, 2004, from defense counsel to Dora L. Hurd (\"Hurd\"), a non-party \nwitness employed at the Jail during the relevant time period.  Plaintiffs opposed. \nOral argument was heard on October 22,2004, in Albany, New York.  Decision was \nreserved. \nOn December 22, 2004, Clarendon Insurance Company (\"Clarendon\") moved to \nintervene.  Defendants noted that they would not be making any submissions with regard to \nthe motion to intervene.  Plaintiffs opposed.  Clarendon's motion to intervene was taken on \nsubmission of the papers, without oral argument. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA written Jail policy provides procedures for admitting/booking inmates into the \nJail.  The admissions policy, effective July 1, 1996,1 provides for an initial pat-down search of \nadmittees upon their entrance into the facility.  (See Pitts.' Ex. D.)  A separate policy defines \ndifferent types of searches and delineates the circumstances in which each should be used, \nas will be discussed momentarily.  (See Pitts.' Ex. S.) \nUpon a determination that the admittee would be housed at the Jail (in other words, \nwould not make bail) the policy provides for an officer to facilitate the admittees' change from \nstreet clothes into Jail attire, as follows: \nthe booking officer will escort the inmate to the shower area where the \ninmate will disrobe and place all clothes in the bag provided by the officer, \nand be required to take a shower.  A.  All persons and personal property \nA new policy became effective on May 21, 2003, that was revised to reflect a new sheriff and \n1 \njail administrator.  The language regarding the admission procedure was not changed. \n- 3-\n\nshall be searched in accordance to the law.  Solely to prevent the \nintroduction of contraband to the facility .... \n(Pltfs.' Ex. D ~ 12.)  Defendants refer to this portion of the admission process as a \"change-\nout\" procedure.  Pursuant to this policy, when an admittee is being processed, a Corrections \nOfficer (\"CO\") (who is the same sex as the admittee) has him or her remove all of their \nclothing and place it in a bag.  The admittee then must shower. \nDefendant John Pecora (\"Pecora\"), Jail Administrator at the relevant times, testified \nthat during the change-out, the CO viewed the naked inmate through a window to see if there \nwere any gang tattoos indicating gang affiliation.  (Pltfs.' Ex. H, Pecora Dep. at  122-23, 126-\n35, Ex. I, Pecora Dep. at 58-59.)  Richard Denton (\"Denton\"), a CO and supervisor at the Jail \nfrom 1994 to 2003, testified that during the change-out he would stand in the shower room \nwhile an admittee disrobed and put his street clothes into a bag.  (Pltfs.' Ex. K, Denton Dep. \nat 35-36, 51-52.)  Denton stated that he visually would observe an admittee as he disrobed, \nnoting any tattoos generally (not gang tattoos), and contraband.  Id. at 38, 88-89, 105. \nHowever, he did not consider this a search but rather an observation.  See id. at 38. \nDefendant Susan o. Buddies (\"Buddies\") was employed as a part-time CO at the \nJail beginning in 1992.  She was promoted to supervisory positions, which she held during \nthe relevant time periods.  Buddies testified that the purpose of the change-out was to be \nsure the inmate was not injured or bruised, to become aware of any scars or tattoos, and, \nmost importantly, to prevent the introduction of contraband into the Jail.  (Pltfs.' Ex. J, \nBuddies Oep. at 34-35.)  She stated that only female COs changed-out female inmates, and \nonly male COs changed-out male inmates.  Id. at 37.  The only instance of a gang-related \n-4 -\n\ntattoo of which she was aware was of a tear drop near the eye, signifying membership in the \nBlood gang.  Id. \nDonald F. Gardner, a CO at the Jail from 1986 to 2002, testified that he moved \naround during the change-out.  (Pitts.' Ex. L, Gardner Dep. at 57.)  However, he stated that \nan admittee's genitals could be seen during the change-out.  lQ. at 57-58.  Additionally, he \ntestified that the purpose of the change-out was for hygiene, not to detect contraband and \nnot to detect tattoos.  lQ. at 57. \nHurd, a CO at the Jail from 2000 to 2002, testified that she stayed in the shower \narea while the admittee was changing and looked at the naked admittee to be sure that all of \nher clothing had been taken off and put in the property bag.  (Pitts.' Ex. M, Hurd Dep. at 40-\n41.)  Assuring that all the admittee's clothing was in the property bag prevented contraband \nfrom entering the Jail, according to Hurd.  Id. at 42.  She never heard of a gang tattoo \nsearch, and was never instructed to look for gang tattoos during a change-out.  Id. at 55, 79-\n80.  Further, she knew of no one else who did so.  Id. at 79-80. \nAaron L. Robinson was a CO at the Jail between February 2001 and February \n2002.  He also stood in the shower room while the admittee changed clothes, and was \npositioned so that he could see most of the naked body and partly see the genitals.  (Pitts.' \nEx. N, Robinson Dep. at 25-27.)  In addition to observing the naked body of the admittee, \nRobinson asked them to turn around, and to hold their arms out in front of them and squat. \nId. at 28-29.  He did not ask them to bend over, lift or manipulate their genitals, or spread \ntheir buttocks.  Id.  Robinson stated that he did not look for tattoos during a change-out.  lQ. \nat 121.  He stated that the purpose of the change-out was to prevent contraband (the squat \n- 5-\n\nwas required to be sure the admittee was not hiding anything.)  Id. at 76, 79.  Robinson also \nopined that the change-out was not a search.  lQ. at 71. \nAfter showering, the admittee dried off, then donned prison garb that was provided \nto him or her.  The admissions policy, hence the change-out procedure, applies to everyone \nwho is admitted to the Jail. \nIn addition to a written policy for admissions/booking, the Jail has a written policy \npertaining to searches.2  According to the search policy, a strip search was defined as \"A \nvisual examination of an inmate's naked body and physical examination of the inmate's \nclothing for contraband and/or injuries and physical abnormalities.\"  (Pitts.' Ex. S.) \nAccording to the policy, strip searches \"may\" be conducted upon admission, after contact \nvisits, on return from a temporary release program and work detail outside the facility, prior to \nand upon returning from any trip outside the facility, and \"as authorized by the shift \nsupervisor whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe the inmate possesse[d] \ncontraband which may not be detected by a pat search or metal detector search.\"  Id. \nPecora testified that a strip search always was conducted after an inmate was \noutside the facility, such as on work release, without regard to reasonable suspicion.  (Pitts.' \nEx. H, Pecora Dep. at 164-65.)  Included in the strip search is a visual check of the all body \ncavities.  (Pitts.' Ex. S.)  Denton described a strip search as follows:  the inmate would \ndisrobe, squat down, cough, lift their genital sack, and open their mouth and the CO would \nlook in the inmate's open mouth, run his fingers through the inmate's hair, and spread their \nbuttocks.  (Pitts.' Ex. K, Denton Dep. at 34.) \n2  This policy covers pat, strip, body cavity, metal detector, overall, and area searches.  (Pitts.' Ex. \nS.)  Only strip searches are relevant to the issues at hand. \n-6 -\n\nPecora described the circumstances in which a strip search could be conducted, \nalthough it was not required.  If there was reasonable suspicion that an inmate had \ncontraband or a weapon, the supervisor could authorize a strip search.  (Pitts.' Exp. I, Pecora \nDep. at 11-12.)  Pecora elaborated that if an admittee were going to be housed in the Jail, \nand there was reason to believe that the person was hiding contraband, was \"highly \nassaultive,\" or otherwise was \"a high risk individual with high charges\" then the supervisor \ncould require a strip search.  Id. at 19-20.  Denton noted that if contraband were discovered \nduring the change-out process, a strip search could be conducted.  (Pitts.' Ex. K, Denton \nDep. at 65-66.) \nIf it was determined that a strip search was needed for an admittee, then it would \ntake place in the shower area either before or after the shower.  (Pitts.' Exp. I, Pecora Dep. at \n58-60; Pitts.' Ex. K, Denton Dep. at 72.)  The CO would be in the shower area directing the \nadmittee during the strip search.  (Pitts.' Ex. I, Pecora Dep. at 58-60, Ex. K, Denton Dep. at \n66.) \nDenton also noted that a list was posted on the wall in the booking room listing \ncertain Penal Code sections, or \"strip-searchable offenses.\"  (Pitts.' Ex. K, Denton Dep. at \n56.)  The CO conducting the booking would compare the Penal Code section under which an \nadmittee was charged to the list to determine if a strip search was permissible.  Id. 56-61.  If \nthe charge matched the list, then it was permissible, but not required, to conduct a strip \nsearch.3  Id.  Buddies testified that the list of strip-searchable offenses posted in the booking \nroom did not stand on its own--other reasons must be present before a strip search was \n3  Under the table of strip searchable penal law offenses, it stated:  \"This is a list of offenses for \nwhich strip searches may be automatically conducted at admission.  It does not limit the right to do \nsearches if their [sic] is reasonable suspicion that the inmate is concealing contraband.\"  (Pitts.' Ex. 0.) \n- 7 -\n\nconducted.  (Pitts.' Ex. J, Buddies Dep. at 167-69.)  Gardner testified that whether or not a \ncharge was on the list, he would consider the admittee's nature, actions, type of clothing, and \npersonal property in determining whether to conduct a strip search at admission.  (Pitts.' Ex. \nL, Gardner Dep. at 39-46.)  Robinson testified that he was not aware of the charge against \nan admittee at the time he performed the change-out.  (Pitts.' Ex. N, Robinson Dep. at 38.) \nHurd did not recall ever having seen the strip-searchable offenses list.  (Pitts.' Ex. M, Hurd \nDep. at 55-58.) \nMarriott was admitted to the Jail on Sept. 13, 2001, on misdemeanor \nAgriculture and Markets violations relating to failure to feed and water five horses.  After the \ninitial questioning and fingerprinting in the booking process, he was taken to the shower \nroom.  A CO told him to remove all of his clothing, shake it out as he took it off, and to take a \nshower, which he did.  The CO watched him undress and shower.  After the shower, while \ncompletely naked, the CO told Marriott to lift up his arms, open his mouth, and show the CO \nthe bottoms of his feet.  Marriott was also required to bend over in front of the CO and spread \nthe lobes of his buttocks.  He was then told to dress in a Jail uniform, which he did.  Marriott \nwas released the next day after bail was posted. \nDavis was arrested at her home on May 2, 2001, after missing a court date in \nFamily Court.  She was brought before a Family Court judge, who informed her that she \nwould be jailed until she paid $2,000.00 in past-due child support.  Her arrest and \nincarceration rested upon a civil family court warrant, not related to any criminal offense. \nUpon her arrival at the Jail, the booking officer questioned her.  Then a female CO escorted \nher to the shower room.  The CO directed her to remove all of her clothing and take a \nshower.  The CO watched her shower.  After the shower, while Davis was completely naked, \n-8 -\n\nthe CO ordered her to lift up her arms and open her mouth.  The CO also required Davis to \nbend over in front of her and spread the lobes of her buttocks.  Davis was released three \ndays later, when her brother posted the $2,000.00 for her. \nRivera was admitted to the Jail on June 1, 2004, on a misdemeanor second degree \naggravated harassment charge.  After the initial admissions paperwork, a CO took him the \nshower room.  A CO required Rivera to remove all of his clothing, including his underwear, \nand submit to a visual inspection.  Rivera then donned the Jail clothing provided to him. \nNon-party Jacqueline Ashline (\"Ashline\") asserts that she has agreed to serve as a \nnamed plaintiff and class representative.  On April 6, 2001, Ashline was brought to the Jail as \na pre-trial detainee.  She was charged with driving while intoxicated, a Vehicle and Traffic \nLaw offense.  After being fingerprinted, she was taken by a female CO to the shower room. \nThe CO required her to remove all of her clothing and take a shower.  She complied.  The \nCO watched Ashline disrobe and shower.  After showering, Ashline dried off.  The CO left the \nshower room and then passed a Jail uniform to Ashline through a window in the room for her \nto put on. \nThe named plaintiffs and Ashline contend that they are representatives of a class \ndefined as follows: \nAll persons in the United States who have been or will be placed into the \ncustody of the Montgomery County Jail after being charged with \nmisdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic \ninfractions or other minor crimes, or held on civil matters, and were or will \nbe strip searched upon their entry into the Montgomery County Jail \npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Montgomery County \nSheriffs Department and the County of Montgomery. The class period \ncommences on April 29,2000, and extends to the date on which the \nMontgomery County Sheriffs Department and/or the County of \nMontgomery are enjOined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their \nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip searches \n- 9-\n\nabsent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from the proposed \nclass are Defendants, and all of their respective affiliates, legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n(Am. Compl. 1{18.) \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nClarendon seeks intervention in order to make arguments in support of defendants' \ncross motion for summary judgment.  Accordingly, the motion to intervene will be addressed \nfirst.  Although defendants' motion for summary judgment was made by cross motion, it will \nbe addressed second since a disposition in defendants' favor would render the remaining \nquestions moot.  The remaining issues, the appeal of the Magistrate Judge's decision, \nplaintiffs' motion for class certification, and the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive \nrelief, will then be addressed. \nA.  Motion to Intervene \nIntervention is permitted when a conditional right to intervene is conferred by a \nfederal statute and \"when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a \nquestion of law or fact in common.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).  Timeliness of the motion to \nintervene is a threshold requirement.  Id.; United States v. Pitney Bowes. Inc., 25 F.3d 66, 74 \n(2d Cir. 1994). \nThe court exercises discretion in determining whether to permit intervention, while \nconsidering \"whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the \nrights of the original parties.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).  \"Additional relevant factors 'include the \nnature and extent of the intervenors' interests,' the degree to which those interests are \n'adequately represented by other parties,' and 'whether parties seeking intervention will \nsignificantly contribute to full development of the underlying factual issues in the suit and to \n- 10-\n\nthe just and equitable adjudication of the legal questions presented.'\"  H.L. Hayden Co. of \nNew York v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85 (2d Cir. 1986) (quoting Spangler v. \nPasadena City Bd. of Ed., 552 F.2d 1326, 1329 (9th Cir. 1977) (footnote omitted), as quoted \nin United States Postal Servo v. Brennan, 579 F.2d 188, 191-92 (2d Cir. 1978)). \nHere, Clarendon insured Montgomery County for the year 2002, within the range of \nthe proposed class definition.  Clarendon asserts that by virtue of its status as an insurer, it \nhas a significant interest in the outcome of plaintiffs' motion for class certification and \ndefendants' cross motion for summary judgment.  However, it has no claim or defense, \ntherefore no question of law or fact common to the main action.  That Clarendon has no \nclaim or defense is established by its reliance upon the defendants' Amended Answer. \n(Reply Aff. 114; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c) (requiring that a motion to intervene \"be \naccompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is \nsought\".)) Further, Clarendon seeks to intervene solely to argue an issue on the pending \nmotions, not to become a party to the action, indicating that it is not asserting any claim or \ndefense.  Intervention would be improper, where, as here, there is no question of law or fact \nin common with the main action because there is no asserted claim or defense.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 24(b); cf. Metzler v. Bennett, No. 97-CV-0148, 1998 WL 187454, at *10 (N.D.N.Y. \nApr. 15, 1998) (denying motion for intervention where no common question of law or fact \nbecause applicants' claims based on different statutory provisions which arose out of \ndifferent factual context). \nClarendon argues that its interest in the outcome of the motions bears upon the \ndetermination of the motion to intervene.  It first cites the relevance factors of Brennan, such \nas the nature and extent of the intervenor's interest.  However, these factors are considered \n- 11 -\n\nby a court in determining whether to permit intervention as set forth in Rule 24(b), that is, \nwhether intervention will cause undue delay or prejudice in the adjudication of the rights of \nthe original parties.  See Brennan, 579 F.2d at 191-92.  Consideration of the factors \npresupposes that the applicable prerequisite of the Rule--\"when an applicant's claim or \ndefense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common\" --is met.  See Fed. R \nCiv. P. 24(b).  Here the prerequisite has not been met therefore consideration of the Brennan \nfactors is irrelevant. \nClarendon also cited Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Mitlof, 193 F.RD. 154 (S.D.N.Y. \n2000), in support of permitting an insurance company to intervene when a possibility existed \nthat its policy would be implicated by a judgment in the action.  In Mitlof, the court found \nintervention appropriate under Rule 24(a), intervention as of right.  Rule 24(a), in contrast to \n24(b) which is at issue here, allows intervention when an interest is claimed '''relating to the \nproperty or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that \nthe disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability \nto protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing \nparties.'\"  Mitlof, 193 F.RD. at 161 (quoting Fed. R  Civ. P. 24(a)).  Thus, it was appropriate \nfor the Mitlof Court to assess the insurer's interest in the determination at issue in the main \naction as well as its ability to protect its interest.  See Mitlof, 193 F.RD. at 160-62 (analyzing \nthe proposed intervenor's interest in the action and the impairment of that interest pursuant \nto Rule 24(a)).  In contrast, here the analysis under Rule 24(b) requires a determination of \nthe existence of a common question of law or fact--not whether the interest claimed relates to \nthe action.  Compare Fed. R  Civ. P. 24(b) with Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a).  Additionally, the \napplicant in Mitlof sought to bring a counterclaim seeking declaratory relief.  193 F.RD. at \n- 12-\n\n161.  Here, Clarendon does not wish to bring any sort of claim--it only wishes to argue an \nissue on the pending motions.  Mitlof is factually and legally distinguishable from the case at \nhand and provides no support for the motion to intervene. \nIn sum, Clarendon has failed to demonstrate the existence of a common question \nof law or fact.  Therefore, the motion to intervene is denied. \nB.  Defendants' Cross Motion for Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment must be granted when the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, admissions and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any \nmaterial fact, and that the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56; Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U,S. 242, 247 (1986).  The moving \nparty carries the initial burden of demonstrating an absence of a genuine issue of material \nfact.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Facts, \ninferences therefrom, and ambiguities must be viewed in a light most favorable to the \nnonmovant.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). \nWhen the moving party has met the burden, the nonmoving party \"must do more \nthan simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"  Matsushita \nElec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 586.  At that point, the nonmoving party \"must set forth specific \nfacts showing that there is a genuine issue for triaL\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Liberty Lobby, Inc., \n477 U.S. at 250; Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 587.  To withstand a summary \njudgment motion, sufficient evidence must exist upon which a reasonable jury could return a \nverdict for the nonmovant.  Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 248-49; Matsushita Elec. Indus. \nCo., 475 U.S. at 587. \n- 13-\n\nDefendants seek summary judgment contending that the undisputed facts in the \ncase show that there was no Jail policy or practice of strip searching admittees without \nregard to reasonable suspicion.  At the same time, however, they agree that Jail policy \nprovides that each admittee must completely disrobe in front of an officer and stand while the \nofficer observes the naked body for injury and gang tattoos.  (See. e.g., Defs.' Mem. at 3.) \nAfter this visual observation by a CO the admittee showers and changes into Jail attire. \nDefendants term this procedure a change-out, and insist it is not a strip search.  The \njustification for not terming the change-out a strip search lies in the written Jail policy that \ndefines strip search as a \"visual[] check of the inmate's body, including all body cavities.\" \n(Pitts.' Ex. Bat 5.)  Defendants contrast the Jail's definitions:  the strip search which includes \na check of all body cavities versus the change-out which does not require a body cavity \ncheck. \nUsing any other definition of strip search necessarily negates defendants' \nargument.  Moreover, questions of fact exist as to exactly what the policy and practice is of \nthe Jail with regard to the change-out. \nThe common definition of strip search is \"to search (a person) by requiring removal \nof the clothes.\"  Webster's New World Dictionary 1328 (Victoria Neufeldt & David B. Guralnik, \neds., 3d College ed. 1988).  As a legal term, strip search means \"[a] search of a person \nconducted after that person's clothes have been removed, the purpose usu[ally] being to find \nany contraband the person might be hiding.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 1378-79 (8th ed. 2004). \nSearch is \"[a]n examination of a person's body, property, or other area that the person would \nreasonably be expected to consider as private.\"  Id. at 1377.  Notably, even the legal \ndefinition mentions nothing about a body cavity search being integral to a strip search.  It is \n- 14-\n\nnecessary to look at what took place at the change-out procedure to determine whether it \nfalls within the definition of a strip search. \nHere, there is no dispute that during the change-out admittees are required to \nremove all of their clothing in the presence of a CO, without any reasonable suspicion \ninquiry.  Even the COs all agreed that they were present when the admittee removed his or \nher clothing and the admittee's naked body was visible to them.  Where they differ is in the \nextent and purpose of the ensuing search.  For example, Gardner testified that the purpose \nof the change-out was for hygiene, and not to detect contraband or tattoos.  (Pitts.' Ex. L, \nGardner Dep. at 57.)  However, he did state that he could see an admittee's genitals during \nthe change-out.  Id. at 57-58.  In contrast, Denton testified that he visually observed an \nadmittee to note tattoos generally and contraband.  (Pitts.' Ex. K, Denton Dep. at 38, 88-89, \n105.)  Buddies testified that the naked admittee was viewed to find any injuries, tattoos or \nscars, and for contraband.  (Pitts.' Ex. J, Buddies Dep. at 34-35.)  According to Hurd, the \npurpose of the change-out was to detect contraband, primarily by taking all of the admittee's \nclothing.  (Pitts.' Ex. M, Hurd Dep. at 42.)  In further contrast, Robinson stated that in addition \nto viewing the admittee's naked body, he required that they turn around, lift out their arms, \nand squat.  (Pitts.' Ex. N. Robinson Dep. at 28-29.)  His main purpose was to detect \ncontraband, and he did not even look for tattoos.  lQ. at 76,79, 121.  Further, Marriott, Davis, \nand Ashline testified that in addition to being visually observed while naked they were \nrequired to bend over and spread the lobes of their buttocks. \nThe differences just pointed out in the extent and purpose of the change-out \nprocedure do not change the fact that the admittees are required to strip naked in front of a \nCO and submit to the observation of their body by the CO.  This procedure squarely fits both \n- 15-\n\nthe common and legal definitions of strip search.  At bottom, the defendants' argument is one \nof semantics, and the argument fails.  Defendants' insistence that no strip search occurs is \ncontrary to all the factual testimony, of both corrections officers and plaintiffs.  Using different \nterminology, such as change-out, does not change the observation of a naked admittee to \nanything other than what it is--a strip search. \nDefendants contend that the Second Circuit has determined that in order to be \nconstitutionally problematic, a strip search must target the breast, genitals, and anus, citing \nWeber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986).  This misstates the law of this Circuit.  In Weber, \nthe Second Circuit held that the \nFourth Amendment precludes prison officials from performing strip/body \ncavity searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor \noffenses unless the officials have a reasonable suspicion that the \narrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime \ncharged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the \ncircumstances of the arrest. \n804 F.2d at 802.  However, the court's finding that a striplbody cavity search is \nunconstitutional absent reasonable suspicion does not equate to a holding that any less \nintrusive search comports with the Fourth Amendment.  Indeed, the court recognized that two \ntypes of search were at issue in discussing the deference to prison officials when determining \n\"when the intrusion of strip searches and body cavity searches\" are justifiable.  See id. at 804 \n(emphasis added).  Further the court cited to \"eleven circuit court decisions ... hold[ing] \nsimilar policies unconstitutional,\" five of which involved strip (not body cavity) searches.  See \nid. at 803, 801 nn.6-7.  Further amplification of the Weber decision has since been rendered. \nSee Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 69 (2d Cir. 1988) (reiterating its holding in Weber that \n\"particularized suspicion is required for strip-searching any person arrested for a \n- 16 -\n\nmisdemeanor or other minor offense\").  The Weber Court simply did not hold that the breast, \ngenitals, and anus must be targeted in order to run afoul of the Constitution. \nDefendants further base their entitlement to qualified immunity on the assertion that \nthere is no policy to strip search admittees without regard to reasonable suspicion.  Based \nupon the foregoing, it is clear that there is such a policy, and defendants are not entitled to \nsummary judgment on their qualified immunity defense.  Moreover, the individual defendants \nare not entitled to qualified immunity because it is clearly established that \"indiscriminate strip \nsearches\" are unconstitutional.  Walsh, 849 F.2d at 69 (explaining that the Weber Court \nfound that the unconstitutionality of indiscriminate strip searches was clearly established in \nJune 1983); Shain v. Ellison. 273 F.3d 56, 66 (2d Cir. 2001) (explaining that qualified \nimmunity was properly denied because the right to be free of a strip search absent \nreasonable suspicion was clearly established at the time of incident). \nAccordingly, defendants are not entitled to summary judgment. \nC.  Appeal of Magistrate Judge's Decision \nDefendants appeal the oral order of Hon. David E. Peebles, United States \n. Magistrate Judge, made on June 24, 2004 and embodied in a written order dated July 7, \n2004, to that extent that the order required production of letters dated March 26, 2004, and \nApril 20, 2004, from defense counsel to non-party Dora Hurd.  Plaintiffs oppose the appeal. \nThe order was stayed pending resolution of the appeal. \nThe standard for review of a magistrate judge's decision on non-dispositive matters \nis whether the magistrate judge's findings are \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\"  28 \nU.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1 )(A); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).  Clear error may be found \"when although there \nis evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite \n- 17 -\n\nOn March 26, 2004, defense counsel sent two letters addressed to Hurd, to the last \ntwo known addresses that were available.  On April 14, 2004, plaintiffs disclosed that they \nintended to depose Hurd as a non-party witness.  Defense counsel confirmed that Hurd \nworked at the Saratoga Correctional Facility, and left a telephone message for her there on \nApril 15, 2004.  Hurd returned the call the next day.  She stated that she had not received a \nletter from counsel and she had not been subpoenaed to a ~eposition.  She confirmed to \ndefense counsel that she wished to be represented by them.  Defense counsel sent an \nadditional letter to Hurd on April 20, 2004, at her current address, regarding representation. \nJudge Peebles found that the letters at issue were not protected by the attorney \nclient privilege or the work-product doctrine. \nHurd never received the March 26,2004 letters.  Thus, they were not in her \npossession and would not be covered by the subpoena.  Additionally, because she never \nreceived them the Magistrate Judge's reasoning that they were sent prior to the formation of \nthe relationship cannot support finding waiver or lack of privilege.  As to the April 20, 2004 \nletter, it was not, as Judge Peebles stated, \"merely\" information regarding the representation. \nRather, the letter went to great length in explaining the potential conflict with non-party \n- 18-\n\nwitnesses, the named defendants, and the County.  It was clearly erroneous to compel the \nproduction of the three letters.  Therefore, to the extent that the July 7, 2004, order \ncompelled production of the March 26, 2004, and April 20, 2004, letters, it is set aside.  See \nFed. R  Civ. P. 72(a). \nD.  Motion to Certify the Class \n'''In determining the propriety of a class action, the question is not whether the \nplaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits, but rather \nwhether the requirements of Rule 23 have been met.'\"  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 \nU.S. 156, 178,94 S. Ct. 2140, 2153 (1974) (quoting Miller v. Mackey Int'l, 452 F.2d 424 (5th \nCir. 1971 )).  Thus, when deciding a motion to certify a class, the allegations in the complaint \nare accepted as true.  See Shelter Realty Corp. V. Allied Maint. Corp., 574 F.2d 656, 661 \nn.15 (2d Cir. 1978).  \"Rule 23 requires a litigant who would bring a class action to overcome \ntwo hurdles.  First, he must satisfy all the conditions of 23(a) and then he must also convince \nthe court that his action is appropriate under one of the three subdivisions of 23(b).\"  Green \nv. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291, 298 (2d Cir. 1968); Amchem Prods. Inc. v. Windsor, 521  U.S. \n591,614,117 S. Ct. 2231, 2245 (1997). \nThe plaintiff, as the party seeking class certification, bears the burden of proof in \ndemonstrating that the requirements have been met.  Caridad V.  Metro-North Commuter \nRR, 191 F.3d 283, 291 (2d Cir. 1999); Verdow V.  Sutkowy, 209 F.RD. 309, 311  (N.D.N.Y. \n2002).  However, plaintiff is not required to make an extensive evidentiary showing.  Ve rd ow , \n209 F.RD. at 311.  Further, courts are implored to construe liberally the Rule 23 \nrequirements.  Eisen V. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555, 563 (2d Cir. 1968); Verdow ,209 \nF.RD. at 311. \n- 19 -\n\n1.  Rule 23(a) Prerequisites \nThe prerequisites to a class action are:  \"(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of \nall members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) \nthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of \nthe class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe class.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In common legal parlance, these requirements are \ngenerally referred to as numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. \nSee General Tel. Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330,100 S. Ct. 1698, 1706 (1980). \nThe first requirement that plaintiffs must prove under Rule 23(a) is that the \nprospective class is so numerous that joinder is \"impracticable.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). \n\"Impracticable\" in this context is not equivalent to \"impossible,\" and plaintiffs need not even \nprecisely quantify the prospective class so long as they reasonably estimate the number of \npotential class members.  See Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931,935 (2d Cir. 1993); \nVerdow, 209 F.R.D. at 311.  The Second Circuit has held that a prospective class of forty or \nmore raises a presumption of numerosity.  See Consol. Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 \nF.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995). \nPlaintiffs assert that booking sheets for prospective class members number over \n2,000.  Additionally, approximately 1,500 individuals charged with misdemeanors or other \nminor crimes were admitted to the Jail during 2000, 2001, and 2002.  Thus, it is estimated \nthat the class will number over 2,000.  Defendants do not challenge these numbers.  Rather, \nthey argue essentially that there was no strip search, therefore those 2,000-plus admitlees \nwould not fall within the class.  Plaintiffs have established sufficient numerosity.  See Consol. \nRail Corp., 47 F.3d at 483. \n- 20-\n\nThe second requirement of commonality requires a showing that the prospective \nclass members share common questions of law or fact.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  Where the \n\"claims of all proposed class members derive from the same [] policies and procedures, and \nare based on the same legal theories,\" the commonality requirement is met.  McNeill v. New \nYork City Hous. Auth., 719 F. Supp. 233, 252 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). \nHere the representative parties and the members of the proposed class base their \nFourth Amendment unreasonable search claims on the unconstitutionality of the Jail change \nout procedure.  That is, the named plaintiffs and the putative class members have the same \n, legal claims based upon the same official procedure.  Accordingly, the commonality \nrequirement is met.  See id. \nThe third requirement, typicality, requires that claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative party or parties are typical of those of the prospective class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(3).  The representative claims need not be identical to the claims of every class \nmember in order to meet the typicality requirement.  McNeill, 719 F. Supp. at 252.  The \nclaims of the representative parties in this case, while involving a more detailed search than \nevery member of the class, still are based upon a strip search conducted pursuant the Jail \nchange-out policy.  Therefore, the typicality requirement is met. \nThe final requirement under Rule 23(a) is that the representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the prospective class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \nWhen determining if this requirement is met, a plaintiff must make two showings: (1) that \ncounsel for the prospective class is qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the \nlitigation; and (2) that the class members, especially the representative party, do not have \ninterests antagonistic to one another.  See In re Joint Eastern & Southern Dist. Asbestos \n-21 -\n\nLitigation, 78 F.3d 764, 778 (2d Cir. 1996).  The attorneys representing the named plaintiffs \nand the putative class have established that they are qualified, experienced, and are \ngenerally able to conduct this litigation.  Defendants make no viable arguments to the \ncontrary.  Further, the representative plaintiffs and the putative class do not have antagonistic \ninterests.  Defendants argue that the named plaintiffs' claims are not typical of the class \nbecause they all involved a more invasive search than some of the class members will have \nundergone.  However, as discussed above, claims need not be identical and the named \nplaintiffs meet the typicality requirement.  Accordingly, the variation in the factual claims do \nnot create an antagonism between the interests of the representative plaintiffs and the class. \nThe prerequisites of Rule 23(a) are met.  Consideration of the requirements of \nRules 23(b)(2)and 23(b)(3), upon which plaintiffs' motion for certification is based, will be \ndeterminative of the motion. \n2.  Rule 23(b)(2) Mandatory Class \nThis subsection permits class certification if \"the party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\" \nFed. R  Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  In other words, a class will be certified if \"broad, class-wide \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is necessary to redress a group-wide injury.\"  Robinson v. \nMetro-North Commuter RR Co., 267 F.3d 147, 162 (2d Cir. 2001). \nWhere class-wide injunctive or declaratory relief is sought in a (b)(2) class \naction for an alleged group harm, there is a presumption of cohesion and \nunity between absent class members and the class representatives such \nthat adequate representation will generally safeguard absent class \nmembers' interests and thereby satisfy the strictures of due process.  This \npresumption of cohesion and unity continues where incidental damages \nare also sought because entitlement to such damages does not vary \n-22-\n\nbased on the subjective considerations of each class member's claim, but \nflows directly from a finding of liability on the claims for class-wide \ninjunctive and declaratory relief. \nlQ. at 165 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \nIn the instant case, the challenged policy, the change-out procedure, is generally \napplicable to all class members.  Therefore, final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole is appropriate.  See id. at 162. \nMoreover, while monetary damages are sought, the centerpiece of the litigation is elimination \nof the change-out procedure which is applicable to all admittees without a requirement for \nreasonable suspicion.  Accordingly, class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate. \n3.  Rule 23(bU31 Money Damages Class \n\"Framed for situations in which class action treatment is not as clearly called for as \nit is in Rule 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) situations, Rule 23(b)(3) permits certification where class suit \nmay nevertheless be convenient and desirable.\"  Amchem Prods., 521  U.S. at 615, 117 S. \nCt. at 2245 (internal quotation omitted).  Under Rule 23(b)(3), it must be determined whether: \n(1) '''questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any \nquestions affecting only individual members;'\" and whether (2) proceeding by class action \"'is \nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.'\" \nMoore v. PaineWebber, Inc., 306 F.3d 1247, 1252 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(3)). \nWhile the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) is more demanding than the \ncommonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2), issues applicable to the class will be said to \n\"predominate if resolution of some of the legal or factual questions that qualify each class \nmember's case as a genuine controversy can be achieved through generalized proof, and if \n- 23-\n\nthese particular issues are more substantial than the issues subject only to individualized \nproof.\"  Id.  \"Common issues may predominate when liability can be determined on a class \nwide basis, even when there are some individualized damages issues.\"  In re Visa \nChecklMasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 139 (2d Cir. 2001). \nHere, the common question is whether the change-out, strip search procedure \napplicable to all admittees, regardless of whether reasonable suspicion exists that \ncontraband or weapons are possessed, violates the Fourth Amendment.  This question does \nnot vary among class members.  Questions of fact differing among the members of the class \nrelate to the extent of the search to which each individual was subjected, which would affect \nthe amount of compensatory damages.  Although there may be differing facts about the \npersonal involvement of some individual defendants, the predominate questions pertain to \nthe sheriff, Jail administrators, and the Jail policy.  Other minor differences between class \nmembers, such as what the charges were against each of them, relate to membership in the \nclass but not to other issues. \nEfficiency of adjudication would also be increased by litigation as a class action. \nWhile there are as many as 2,000 class members, there is one central issue of law--whether \nthe change-out strip search violates the Fourth Amendment.  Piece meal litigation by multiple \nplaintiffs in multiple law suits would not promote efficiency and would be inferior to litigation \nof the issue in one suit.  Thus, a class action would promote the fair and efficient resolution \nof this controversy.  Accordingly, certification of the class under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate. \n- 24-\n\nE.  Preliminary Injunction \nPlaintiffs renew their motion for a preliminary injunction.  Defendants oppose. \nAs an initial matter, a plaintiff must have standing in order to seek injunctive relief. \nShain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211, 215 (2d Cir. 2004).  Without standing, subject matter \njurisdiction is lacking and injunctive relief cannot be had.  Id.  In order to establish standing, \nplaintiffs must demonstrate that they '''sustained or [are] immediately in danger of sustaining \nsome direct injury as the result of the challenged official conduct.'\"  Id. (quoting City of Los \nAngeles v. Lyons, 461  U.S. 95,101-102, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 1665 (1983)).  Where there is an \nofficial policy at issue, \"there is a likelihood of recurring injury\" and plaintiffs have standing to \nseek injunctive relief.  Deshawn E. v. Safir, 156 F.3d 340, 345 (2d Cir. 1998). \nA preliminary injunction should issue only where the party seeking such relief \nshows \"that it is likely to suffer irreparable injury if relief is denied [and] also that there is \neither (1) a likelihood of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to \nthe merits to make them a fair ground for litigation, with a balance of hardships tipping \ndecidedly in the [movant's] favor.\"  Procter & Gamble Co. v. Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., 747 \nF.2d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 1984); Otokoyama Co. v. Wine of Japan Import. Inc., 175 F.3d 266, \n270 (2d Cir. 1999); Eng v. Smith, 849 F.2d 80,81-82 (2d Cir. 1988); Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, \n754 F.2d 1015, 1025 (2d Cir. 1985).  Where \"'a preliminary injunction seeks to stay \ngovernmental action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme, \nthe less rigorous fair-ground-for-litigation standard should not be applied.\"'  Brown v. Giuliani, \n158 F.R.D. 251, 264 (E.D.NY. 1994)(quoting Sweeney v. Bane, 996 F.2d 1384, 1388 (2d \nCir. 1993)(internal quotation omitted)); Connecticut Dep't of Envtl. Protection v. OSHA, 356 \n-25-\n\nF.3d 226, 230-31 (2d Cir. 2004) (noting that where a statutory or regulatory scheme is \nchallenged, the more rigorous likelihood of success standard must be met). \nIrreparable harm must be imminent, not remote or speculative.  Brown, 158 F.R.D. \nat 264 (citing Tucker Anthony Realty Corp. v. Schlesinger, 888 F.2d 969, 975 (2d Cir. 1989)). \nWhere monetary damages cannot compensate for the injury, the harm is irreparable.  Id. \n(citing Studebaker Corp. v. Gittlin, 360 F.2d 692, (2d Cir. 1966)).  Further, \"the alleged \nviolation of a constitutional right triggers a finding of irreparable injury.\"  Connecticut Dep't of \nEnvtl. Protection 356 F.3d at 231. \nIn order to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, movants must show that \ntheir chance of prevailing is greater than frfty percent.  Abdul Wali, 754 F .2d at 1025. \n\"[C]onsiderable room for doubt\" may remain.  Id.  A greater showing is required, however, \nwhere the injunction is mandatory rather than prohibitory.  Eng, 849 F.2d at 82 (citing Abdul \nWali, 754 F.2d at 1025).  Where the relief sought is mandatory, a \"clear showing that the \nmoving party is entitled to the relief requested\" must be made.  Abdul Wali, 754 F.2d at 1025 \n(internal quotation omitted); Eng, 849 F.2d at 82.  Additionally, where a preliminary injunction \ngrants substantially all of the relief sought, a substantial likelihood of success on the merits \nmust be established.  Abdul Wali, 754 F.2d at 1026; see Eng, 849 F.2d at 82. \nHere, the change-out procedure (which has been established constitutes a strip \nsearch) is done pursuant to a written policy of the Jail.  Further, class certification has been \ngranted.  Accordingly, plaintiffs, as a certified class, have standing to seek prospective \ninjunctive relief.  See Deshawn E., 156 F.3d at 345. \nThe plaintiffs allege violation of a constitutional right.  Therefore, irreparable harm is \nestablished.  See Connecticut Dep't of Envtl. Protection 356 F.3d at 231. \n- 26-\n\nFinally, plaintiffs must establish a likelihood of success on the merits in order to \nobtain preliminary injunctive relief.  As noted, the evidence submitted by the parties with \nrespect to these motions makes clear that pursuant to the written change-out procedure, \neach admittee is subjected to a strip search (the visual observation of the naked body of the \nadmittee by a CO).  Further, defendants admit that the change-out is accomplished without \nregard to whether reasonable suspicion indicates that a particular admittee is secreting \ncontraband or a weapon.  Finally, there is a strong likelihood that the strip search at issue \nhere, conducted as a matter of course without reasonable suspicion, will be found violative of \nthe Fourth Amendment under Weber and its progeny.  See Walsh, 849 F.2d at 69; Weber, \n804 F.2d at 801  n.6, 802. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nClarendon has no claim or defense related to this action therefore no common \nquestion of law or fact.  Thus, intervention pursuant to Rule 24(b) is not proper. \nThe Jail's change-out procedure, applicable to all admittees without regard to \nreasonable suspicion, is tantamount to a strip search.  Further, qualified immunity is not \nappropriate where, as here, there was a clearly established right to be free from a strip \nsearch in the absence of reasonable suspicion.  Therefore, defendants are not entitled to \nsummary judgment. \nThe March 26, 2004, letters to Dora Hurd were not subject to the subpoena. \nFurther, those letters and the April 20, 2004, letter are protected by the attorney-client \nprivilege and the attorney work product doctrine.  Thus, the Magistrate Judge's \ndeterminations to the contrary are clearly erroneous.  The Order compelling production is \nvacated. \n-27-\n\nPlaintiffs meet the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of \nrepresentation prerequisites of Rule 23(a).  Additionally, final injunctive or declaratory relief \nwould be appropriate to the class as a whole pertaining to the official Jail change-out policy, \nmeeting the requirements for certification of Rule 23(b)(2).  The claims of the putative class \nmembers have common questions of law and fact that predominate over such questions as \nto the individuals.  The circumstances of this case present a situation where a class action is \na superior method for fair and efficient adjudication of the claims.  Thus, the putative class is \nalso appropriate for certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3). \nThe plaintiff class has standing to seek and obtain prospective injunctive relief. \nBecause a constitutional violation is alleged, irreparable harm is established.  The Jail's \nchange-out procedure is a strip search by another name; therefore, plaintiffs' have \ndemonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the claim.  Plaintiffs are \nentitled to preliminary injunctive relief. \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that \n1.  Clarendon'S motion to intervene is DENIED; \n2.  Defendants' cross motion for summary judgment is DENIED; \n3.  The Magistrate Judge's oral order of June 24, 2004, exemplified by a written \norder on July 7,2004, is VACATED; \n4.  Plaintiffs' motion for class certification is GRANTED; \n5.  Plaintiff certified class is defined as follows: \nAll persons in the United States who have been or will be placed into the \ncustody of the Montgomery County Jail after being charged with \nmisdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic \ninfractions or other minor crimes, or held on civil matters, and were or will \nbe strip searched upon their entry into the Montgomery County Jail \n- 28-\n\npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Montgomery County \nSheriffs Department and the County of Montgomery. The class period \ncommences on April 29, 2000, and extends to the date on which the \nMontgomery County Sheriff's Department and/or the County of \nMontgomery are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their \nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip searches \nabsent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from the proposed \nclass are Defendants, and all of their respective affiliates, legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n6.  Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED; and \n7.  Defendants are PRELIMINARILY ENJOINED from conducting a strip search, as \nset forth in the Jail's change-out procedure, with regard to all persons being placed into the \ncustody of the Montgomery County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, \nviolations of probation or parole, traffic infractions or other minor crimes, or held on civil \nmatters, without reasonable suspicion that such persons are secreting contraband and/or \nweapons. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated:  March 25, 2005 \nUtica, New York. \n- 29-",

HURD \nUnited States District Judge \nORDER \nBy Memorandum-Decision and Order filed this date the plaintiff class was certified \npursuant to Fed. R. Div. P. 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3).  It is appropriate in this matter to require \nthat prospective class members be notified of the general legal issues involved and that their \nrights will be affected by resolution of this case.  See LaFlamme v. Carpenters Local #370 \nPension Plan, 212 F.R.D. 448, 459 (N.D.N.Y. 2003).  While discretion may sometimes be \nexercised to permit opt-out rights to absent class members, this is not an appropriate case in \nwhich to do so.  See id.  Thus, notice to the prospective class members will not include an \nopt-out provision.  lQ.  Where, as here, defendants are in sole possession of the information \nabout prospective class members, it is appropriate that defendants either provide the notice \nor cooperate with the plaintiffs by providing the information necessary to provide the notice. \n- 2 -\n\n..  ._I \nJQ.  at 460.  The party providing the notice will d  termine whether the notice will be individual \nI \nor general.  See id.  Costs of providing the noti  e will be borne by plaintiffs.

Defendants elect, on or before Ap il 8, 2005, whether to provide notice to the \nprospective class or provide the information ne  essary to plaintiffs so they can provide such \nnotice; \n2.  The parties confer on or before A  ril 18, 2005.  At such conference, the party \nproviding notice to the prospective class inform the other party of whether the notice to the \nprospective class will be individual or general.  he parties attempt to agree upon the \ncontents of a proposed notice; and \n3.  On or before April 28, 2003, the p  rties submit for approval a proposed joint \norder setting forth the contents of the proposed notice, or, if an agreement as to content \ncannot be reached, the parties submit separate proposed notices. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated:  March 25, 2005 \nUtica, New York. \n-3 ",

Defendants' remaining monetary obligation of $1,950,000 will be provided for \n10 \n\ndeposit into the Settlement Fund within 21  (twenty-one) days of the Effective Date by check \ndrawn on a United States bank. \n3(a)  The parties acknowledge that $184,000  of the defendants'  contribution to the \nsettlement  fund  will  be  paid  by  the  New  York  State  Liquidation  Bureau \n(\"Bureau\")  and that  in  order for  this  payment to  be  made,  the  parties  must \ncomplete and submit certain Bureau documents.  In order to effectuate payment \nof this money into the settlement fund in a timely manner, the parties agree to use \ntheir reasonable best efforts to: \n(i) submit all necessary documents to the Bureau within seven (7) days of \nexecution of this settlement agreement; and \n(ii) do all that is necessary to insure payment of the $184,000 contribution \nto the settlement fund within twenty-one (21) days of the Effective date, \nbut  under  no  circumstances  will  a  delay  of payment  by  the  Bureau \nconstitute a breach by Defendants of this agreement. \n4.  All  administrative expenses,  including the  costs  of attorneys'  fees,  settlement \nadministration, website administration and the provision of notice to class members, will be \ndeducted from the Settlement Amount prior to determining the \"Distribution Amount.\" \nC.  Payments to Class Members \n1.  Each Class Member who submits a timely Claim Form will be entitled to receive \ntheir proportionate share of the Distribution Amount.  This amount will be distributed to the \nClass based on the Plan of Distribution attached to this agreement as Exhibit F. \n2.  No Class Member shall be entitled to more than his or her individual share of the \nDistribution Amount regardless of the number of times he or she has been booked and/or strip \n11 \n\nsearched at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility. \n3.  No portion of the Distribution Amount shall be disbursed before the Effective \nDate, except as set forth in Section III.D.l., below. \n4.  Late claims may be  allowed,  if submitted on or before the date of the Final \nApproval Hearing, under the sole discretion of class counsel for good cause shown.  All late \nclaims must be approved by the Court prior to being paid as part of the distribution of the \nsettlement. \n5.  Defendant County of Montgomery will not seek enforcement of any liens for \nmonies owed solely and wholly to County.  Additionally County agrees not seek enforcement of \nany liens through the Settlement Administrator or Class Counsel, and will accordingly not serve \nthe Settlement Administrator or Class Counsel with notice of any liens, unless the County has a \nlegal obligation to do so and/or will be penalized for failing to do so.  Nothing in this agreement \nshall be construed to be a waiver of any liens, but instead is an agreement by the County not to \nseek the recovery of any liens from  Settlement Administrator or Class  Counsel, unless the \nCounty has a legal obligation to do so or will be penalized for failing to do so.  Defendant further \nrepresents that they will not attempt to collect any liens held by third-persons, or any liens \nresulting from the assignment of child support payments to Montgomery County, the collection \nof which was delegated to the County Department of Social Services, unless the County has a \nlegal obligation to do so and/or will be penalized for failing to do so. \n6.  The  County  also  agrees  not  to  distribute  or  disclose  the  identities  of any \nindividual who is a member of the settlement class or who makes a claim on the settlement fund, \nincluding disclosing these identities to other County or State Departments of Social Services, \nunless the County has a legal obligation to so and/or will be penalized for failing to do so.  This \n12 \n\nwaiver does not limit the Montgomery County Department of Social Services from asserting a \nlien on any other assets that a Class Member or Class Representative may possess.  It also does \nnot preclude the enforcement of any liens held by third parties against class members where \nenforcement efforts are made independent of the Montgomery County Department of Social \nServices. \nD.  Attorneys Fees and Expenses \n1.  Class Counsel will petition the Court for an award of attorneys' fees and \nexpenses in the amount of $600,000.  Defendants shall not oppose Class Counsel's application \nfor said award of fees and expenses, nor will they oppose any appeal filed by Class Counsel \nrelating to their application for an award of attorneys' fees. \nE.  Additional Disclosure of Plaintiffs' Addresses \n1.  Plaintiffs will make a motion to the Court, as a part of the preliminary \napproval motion, for the disclosure of the  Montgomery County Department of Probation and \nDepartment of Social  Services'  records  of the names  and addresses of the members  of the \nPlaintiffs, and for a protective order providing that such names and addresses will only be used \nfor purposes of this lawsuit, and that the aforesaid Probation and Social Services records will be \ndestroyed after the issuance of the Final Approval Order. \n2.  The costs, including but not limited to any costs incurred by the County of \nMontgomery, of production the aforesaid Probation and Social Services records shall be paid \nfrom the Settlement Fund as an administrative cost. \nF.  Partial Distribution Pending Appeal \nIn the event that final approval of the settlement is appealed by Plaintiffs or a \nthird party objector, Defendants will nevertheless make the payment(s) required by part III.B. \n13 \n\nherein.  Class Counsel will distribute such portion of the proceeds that is not subject to dispute \non appeal with the remainder placed in escrow with the Settlement Administrator.  Defendants \nagree not to oppose any appeal taken from the final approval order by the Plaintiffs. \nIV. NOTIFICATION TO CLASS MEMBERS \nPlaintiffs will make a motion to the Court, as a part of the preliminary approval \nmotion, for approval of the notice plan appended to this agreement as Appendix A.  Defendant \nwill not object to this notice plan, and has no responsibility for any notification of this Settlement \nto the Plaintiffs. \nV.  REQUESTS FOR EXCLUSION BY CLASS MEMBERS \nA.  The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to any Request for Exclusion. \nAny Settlement Class Member may make a Request for Exclusion by mailing or delivering such \nrequest  in  writing  to  the  Settlement  Administrator.  Any  Request  for  Exclusion  must  be \npostmarked or delivered not later than the Opt-Out Deadline.

Not later than three (3) business days after the deadline for submission of \nRequests for Exclusion, the Settlement Administrator shall provide an Opt-Out List to Class \nCounsel and to Defendants' Counsel together with copies of the Request for Exclusion.  Class \n14 \n\nCounsel and Defendants' Counsel shall jointly report the names appearing on the Opt-Out List to \nthe Court no less than three (3) business days prior to the Final Approval Hearing. \nD.  Paragraph 2 of Appendix B, which the parties agree to file under seal with \nthe Court until90 days after the Notice Date, is incorporated herein by reference. \nE.

The  agreed-upon procedures  and  requirements  for  filing  objections  in \nconnection with the Final Approval Hearing are intended to ensure the efficient administration of \njustice  and  the  orderly  presentation  of any  Settlement  Class  Members'  objections  to  the \nSettlement Agreement, in accordance with such Settlement Class Members' due process rights. \nThe Preliminary Approval Order and Class Notice will require all Settlement Class Members \nwho have any objections to file such notice of objection or request to be heard with the Clerk of \nthe Court, and serve by mail or hand delivery such notice of objection or request to be heard, \nincluding  all  papers  or  evidence  in  support thereof,  upon  Class  Counsel  and  Defendants' \n15 \n\nCounsel, at the addresses set forth in the Class Notice, no later than the Objection Date.

This action was commenced on April29, 2003, as a class action. \n2.  After years of intensive litigation, including extensive discovery and motion practice before \nthis Court, and including the granting of the Plaintiffs motions for class certification, preliminary \ninjunction, and partial summary judgment, and as a result of intensive, arm's length negotiations \nbetween Class Counsel and Defendants, the parties have reached accord with respect to a Settlement \nthat provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class Members, in return for a release and dismissal \nof the claims at issue in this case against the Defendants (\"Settlement Agreement\"). The resulting \nSettlement Agreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on ______  \n3.  As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a proposed Notice \nPlan and Class Notice, which provided Settlement Class Members notice oft he proposed settlement. \nThe Notice Plan provided an opportunity for class members to file objections to the Settlement. \n4.  As ofthe deadline for the filing of objections, only __ objections were filed.  Given the \nsize of this Settlement, and the notice plan described above, this Court finds that the comparatively \nlow number of objections  is  indicative of the fairness,  reasonableness and adequacy of the \nSettlement with the Defendants. \n5.  The settling Parties have filed with the Court an affidavit from _______ declaring \nthat the mailing of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan, has been completed. \n6.  The Court finds that the published notice, mailed notice and Internet posting constitute the \nbest practicable notice ofthe Fairness Hearing, the proposed Settlement, Class Counsel's application \nfor fees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class Notice and the Short Form Notice; and \nthat such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all members ofthe Settlement Class, \nand complied fully with the requirements ofRule 23 ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \n\nConstitution ofthe United States, the laws ofNew York and any other applicable law. \n7.  Any persons who wished to excluded from this Action were provided an opportunity to \"opt \nout\" pursuant to the Notice.  All persons who have validly excluded themselves from this Action \nhave no rights under the Settlement Agreement and shall not be bound by the Settlement Agreement \nor the final judgment herein. [List attached] \n8.  Class Members are bound by the  Settlement, the Settlement Agreement and releases \ncontained therein, and the Final Order and Judgment, and do not have any further opportunity to opt \nout of the Action. \n9.  Any class member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to the Settlement \nAgreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiffs' Class Counsel's application \nfor fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Class Notice and \nmandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed to have waived any \nsuch objection by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise. \n10.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the Settlement \nAgreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable and adequate \ncompromise ofthe claims against the Defendant in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules ofC  ivil Procedure. There are a number of factors which the Court has considered in affirming \nthis Settlement, including: \n11.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \n12.  The Court notes that for settlement purposes, this Settlement has the benefit of providing \nrelief to Class Members now, without further litigation. This Settlement provides Class Members \nwith a substantial monetary benefit. \n13.  This Settlement is clearly a byproduct ofhard-fought litigation between the parties, and not \n\na result of any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or Counsel for the Defendants. \n14.  Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendants their application for \nreasonable  attorneys'  fees,  costs,  and  expenses  consistent with  the  terms  of the  Settlement \nAgreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request and hereby grants the request. \n15.  The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair,  a simplified \nprocess, and workable. In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work out any unanticipated \nproblems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT, \nTHE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING: \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n16.  This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this proceeding. \n17.  Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following Settlement Class \nis certified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll persons in the United States who have been or will be placed into the custody of \nthe Montgomery County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, \nviolations of probation or parole, traffic infractions or other minor crimes, or held on \ncivil matters, and were strip searched upon their entry into the Montgomery County \nJail pursuant to the policy, custom and practice oft he Montgomery County Sheriffs \nDepartment and the County ofMontgomery. The class period commenced on April \n29,  2000 and extended until March 25, 2005.  Specifically excluded from  the \nproposed  class  are  Defendants,  and  all  of the  respective  affiliates,  legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n18.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements ofRule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a Class Action is an appropriate method for \nresolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for Class certification under Rule 23 \nare present. The Class members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined. Questions oflaw \nand fact common to all Class members predominate over individual issues and should be determined \n\nin one proceeding with respect to all Class members. The Class Representatives' claims are typical \nof those of the Class. The Class action mechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating \nand resolving this action. \n19.  The Class Representatives Paul Marriott, Barbara Davis and Andy Rivera are entitled to and \nare hereby awarded payments of$12,500, $15,000, and $7,500, respectively, in recognition ofthe \nefforts she undertook in connection with this lawsuit. \n20.  The Court grants final approval of the Settlement Agreement, as being fair, reasonable and \nadequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n21.  The Courts finds that the request for attorneys' fees is reasonable. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT AND \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED AS \nFOLLOWS: \n22.  The Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed Settlement is GRANTED. \n23.  The Class Representatives Paul Marriott, Barbara Davis and Andy Rivera are entitled to and \nare hereby awarded payments of$12,500, $15,000, and $7,500, respectively. \n24.  The Class Counsel's application for attorneys' fees and expenses is granted. \n25.  This Action and all claims against the Settling Defendant are hereby dismissed with \nprejudice, but the Court shall retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction of the Action, all Parties, \nand Settlement Class Members, to interpret and enforce the terms, conditions and obligations ofthis \nSettlement Agreement. \n26.  All Class members who have not timely filed an opt-out request are barred and enjoined \nfrom commencing and/or prosecuting any claim or action against the Defendant. Any Class member \nwho has not timely filed a request to exclude themselves shall be enjoined from initiating and/or \n\nproceeding as a class action in any forum. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: \nHon.

HURD\nUnited States District Judge\nMEMORANDUM-DECISION and ORDER\nand\nPERMANENT INJUNCTION\nI.  INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiffs Paul Marriott (\"Marriott\"), Barbara Davis (\"Davis\"), and Andy Rivera\n(\"Rivera\") (collectively \"plaintiffs\") filed suit individually and on behalf of a class of others\nsimilarly situated, alleging that the policy of the Montgomery County Jail (\"the Jail\") providing\nfor the search of all persons admitted to the Jail constitutes a strip search in violation of the\nConstitution of the United States.  Plaintiffs' motion to certify the class pursuant to Rule 23\nwas granted on March 25, 2005, and defendants were preliminarily enjoined from conducting\nthe search at issue.  Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y. 2005)\n(\"Marriott I\").  The Second Circuit affirmed on November 22, 2005.  Marriott v. County of\nMontgomery, No. 05-1590-CV, 2005 WL 3117194, at *1 (2d Cir. Nov. 22, 2005) (โMarriott IIโ).\nOn October 14, 2005, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint against\ndefendant Montgomery County Sheriff's Department and defendants Michael Amato (\"Sheriff\nAmato\"), Jeffrey Smith (\"Smith\"), Kevin Snell (\"Snell\"), John Pecora (\"Pecora\"), and Sue\nBuddles (\"Buddles\") in their official capacities was granted, as the County of Montgomery\n(\"the County\") is liable for the acts of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department and the\n- 2 -\n\nabove defendants in their official capacities as employees of the County.1  The claims against\nSheriff Amato, Smith, Snell, Pecora, and Buddles in their individual capacities remain. \nAdditionally, defendants' motion for partial summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claims for\ncompensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees was denied.2\nPlaintiffs, on behalf of the certified class, now move for partial summary judgment\nagainst the County and Sheriff Amato on the issue of liability.  They also seek a permanent\ninjunction against defendants, as well as interim attorneys' fees for plaintiffs' counsel.  Further,\nplaintiffs move to preclude the testimony of defendants' expert witness, George M. Camp\n(\"Camp\").  Defendants oppose, and move for a certificate of appealability, pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. ยง 1292(b), regarding the October 14, 2005, denial of their motion for partial summary\njudgment dismissing plaintiffs' claims for compensatory damages, punitive damages, and\nattorney fees.  Plaintiffs oppose.\nOral argument was heard on December 15, 2005, in Utica, New York.  Decision was\nreserved.\nII.  FACTS\nThe Jail has a specific, written policy that provides procedures for admitting/booking\ninmates into the Jail.  This admissions policy, which has been in effect since July 1, 1996,\nprovides for an initial pat-down search of admittees upon their entrance into the facility.  (See\ngenerally Docket No. 90, Pls.' Ex. D, ยถ 12.)  The Jail has a separate policy which defines the\n1  A summary order was entered on the record pursuant to the oral decision rendered on October\n14, 2005.  \n2  Defendants' motion to dismiss the claim for punitive damages was denied without prejudice.\n- 3 -\n\ndifferent types of searches that may be conducted by a Corrections Officer (\"CO\") and\ndelineates the circumstances in which each search should be used.\nUpon a determination that an admittee would be housed at the Jail (i.e., would not\nmake bail), the admissions policy provides for an officer to facilitate the admittees' change\nfrom street clothes into Jail attire, as follows:\nthe booking officer will escort the inmate to the shower area where the\ninmate will disrobe and place all clothes in the bag provided by the officer,\nand be required to take a shower.  A.  All persons and personal property\nshall be searched in accordance to the law.  Solely to prevent the\nintroduction of contraband to the facility . . .\nId.  Defendants refer to this portion of the admission process as a \"change-out\" procedure. \nPursuant to the \"change-out\" procedure, when an admittee was being processed for housing\nat the Jail, a CO (who is the same sex as the admittee) directs the admittee to remove his or\nher clothing and place it in a bag; the admittee must then shower.  During the \"change-out,\"\nthe CO would conduct a visual inspection of the admittee's naked body.  (Docket No. 90, Pls.'\nEx. I, Pecora Dep. at 42, 65.)3  After showering, the admittee dried off, then donned the prison\ngarb that was provided.  The admissions policy, hence the โchange-outโ procedure, applies to\neveryone who is admitted to the Jail. \n3  The true purpose of the visual inspection of the admittee's naked body is not clear.  Defendant\nPecora, a Jail Administrator at the relevant times, testified that COs viewed the naked inmate to see if\nthere were any gang tattoos indicating a gang affiliation.  (Docket No. 90, Pls.' Ex. H, Pecora Dep. at 122-\n23, 126-35; Ex. I, Pecora Dep. at 58-59.)  Other COs testified that in addition to noting any tattoos, the\npurpose of the \"change-out\" was to prevent the introduction of contraband into the Jail.  (Docket No. 90,\nPls.' Ex. K, Denton Dep. at 35-36, 51-52; Ex. J, Buddles Dep. at 34-35; Ex. N, Robinson Dep. at 76, 79;\nEx. M, Hurd Dep. at 42.)  Another CO testified that the purpose of the \"change-out\" was for hygiene, not\nto detect contraband or tattoos.  (Docket No. 90, Pls.' Ex. L, Gardner Dep. at 57.)  \nThankfully, the analysis of today's motion does not require a determination of the true purpose of\nthe \"change-out.\"  Analysis turns on the nature of the \"change-out,\" and the fact that it was the standard\nprocedure for every admittee that was housed at the Jail.  What is important is that each admittee was\nrequired to remove his or her clothing and allow a CO to view his or her naked body absent reasonable\nsuspicion; what each CO believed the purpose of the \"change-out\" to be is non-determinative of this\nmotion.\n- 4 -\n\nThe representative plaintiffs in this case - Marriott, Davis, and Rivera - were all\narrested on misdemeanor charges and subjected to the written Jail \"change-out\" procedure.4 \nWhile Marriott and Davis allege that in addition to the shower and visual inspection of their\nnaked bodies, they were directed to submit to various commands while naked, including\nbending over in front of the CO and spreading the lobes of their buttocks, at a minimum, they\nall were forced to remove their clothing and shower in view of the CO conducting their\n\"change-out\" procedure.  They brought suit on behalf of themselves, as well as those similarly\nsituated, claiming that the \"change-out\" procedure was an unconstitutional policy, practice,\nand custom of conducting strip searches of admittees arrested for misdemeanor offenses,\nabsent reasonable suspicion that the admittee was concealing weapons or contraband.  They\nsought class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, as well as a\npreliminary injunction enjoining defendants from performing the \"change-out\" procedure\nabsent reasonable suspicion.  Defendants cross-moved for summary judgment.\nOn March 25, 2005, defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment was denied,\nand plaintiffs' motion for class certification was granted.5  See Marriott I, 227 F.R.D. 159.  The\n4  Marriott was admitted to the Jail on September 13, 2001, on misdemeanor Agriculture and\nMarkets violations relating to failure to feed and water five horses; Davis was admitted on May 2, 2001,\nbased on a civil family court warrant, after missing a court date in Family Court; and Rivera was admitted\non June 1, 2004, on a misdemeanor second degree aggravated harassment charge.\nAdditionally, non-party Jacqueline Ashline (\"Ashline\") agreed to serve as a named plaintiff and\nclass representative.  On April 6, 2001, she was brought to the Jail as a pre-trial detainee; she was\ncharged with driving while intoxicated, a Vehicle and Traffic Law offense.  After being fingerprinted, she\nwas taken by a female CO to the shower room.  The CO required her to remove all of her clothing and\ntake a shower.  She complied.  The CO watched Ashline disrobe and shower.  After showering, Ashline\ndried off.  The CO left the shower room and then passed a Jail uniform to Ashline through a window in\nthe room.\n5  Plaintiffs met the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation\nprerequisites of Rule 23(a), as well as the requirements for certification of Rule 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3). \nMarriott I, 227 F.R.D. at 171-73.\n- 5 -\n\nJail's \"change-out\" policy was found to be a strip search.  Id. at 175.   Plaintiffs' certified class\nwas defined as follows:\nAll persons in the United States who have been or will be placed into the\ncustody of the Montgomery County Jail after being charged with\nmisdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic\ninfractions or other minor crimes, or held on civil matters, and were or will\nbe strip searched upon their entry into the Montgomery County Jail\npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Montgomery County\nSheriffโs Department and the County of Montgomery. The class period\ncommences on April 29, 2000, and extends to the date on which the\nMontgomery County Sheriffโs Department and/or the County of\nMontgomery are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their\nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip searches\nabsent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from the proposed\nclass are Defendants, and all of their respective affiliates, legal\nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.\nId.  Further, as the \"change-out\" procedure was tantamount to a strip search, and conducted\nabsent reasonable suspicion, defendants were\nPRELIMINARILY ENJOINED from conducting a strip search, as set forth\nin the Jail's change-out procedure, with regard to all persons being placed\ninto the custody of the Montgomery County Jail after being charged with\nmisdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic\ninfractions or other minor crimes, or held on civil matters, without\nreasonable suspicion that such persons are secreting contraband and/or\nweapons.\nId.  The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that \"plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of\nestablishing that the Jail's current strip search policy is unconstitutional.\"  Marriott II, 2005 WL\n3117194, at *1.\nIII.  DISCUSSION\nA.  Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nWhen considering a motion for summary judgment, evidence is viewed in the light\nmost favorable to the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in her favor. \n- 6 -\n\nAbramson v. Pataki, 278 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir. 2002).  It is well settled that summary judgment\nmust be granted only when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nadmissions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and\nthat the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2509-10 (1986);\nRichardson v. New York State Dep't of Corr. Servs., 180 F.3d 426, 436 (2d Cir. 1999).  An\nissue is \"genuine\" if the relevant evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict\nfor the non-moving party.  Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248-49, 106 S. Ct. at 2510-11.\nA party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact, as to a dispositive issue.  Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2553 (1986).  Once the moving party has met\nthis burden, the party opposing the motion for summary judgment must produce specific\nevidence establishing the existence of a genuine factual dispute that a reasonable jury could\nfind in its favor.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475\nU.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356 (1986).  The non-moving party \"must do more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"  Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 587, 106 S. Ct. at 1356.  It cannot rest upon \"mere allegations or denials\" asserted in\nits pleadings.  Rexnord Holdings, Inc. v. Bidermann, 21 F.3d 522, 525-26 (2d Cir. 1999).\nTo withstand a summary judgment motion, sufficient evidence must exist upon\nwhich reasonable factfinders could resolve the issue in favor of the nonmovant.  Liberty\nLobby, 477 U.S. at 248-49, 106 S. Ct. at 2510; Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S. Ct. at\n1356.  Thus, summary judgment is proper where there is \"little or no evidence . . . in support\n- 7 -\n\nof the non-moving party's case.\"  Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., 22 F.3d 1219, 1223-\n24 (2d Cir. 1994) (citations omitted).\nPlaintiffs seek partial summary judgment, contending that the undisputed facts in\nthis case show that prior to the issuance of the preliminary injunction and pursuant to the\npolicy of the County, all arrestees admitted into the Jail were strip searched upon admission,\nabsent reasonable suspicion.  As the Jail's \"change-out\" policy is tantamount to a strip search,\nplaintiffs argue that partial summary judgment on the issue of liability against the County and\nSheriff Amato is proper.  \nDefendants oppose and claim that there are issues of material fact as to the actual\npolicy and procedure of the \"change-out\" that preclude summary judgment.  They allege that\nthe admissions policy, including the \"change-out,\" is constitutional as written, and because the\nwritten policies are constitutional, there is insufficient evidence to determine the material\nfactual issue of whether a policy and practice of performing unconstitutional inspections of\nevery naked arrestee at admissions existed.\nThe Second Circuit has repeatedly held that the Fourth Amendment precludes\nprison officials from performing strip searches and/or body cavity searches of arrestees\ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor offenses unless the officials have a reasonable\nsuspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime\ncharged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \nShain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211, 214 (2d Cir. 2004); N.G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225, 232 (2d\nCir. 2004); Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 69 (2d Cir. 1988); and Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796,\n- 8 -\n\n802 (2d Cir. 1986).6  \"[I]ndiscriminate strip-searching of misdemeanor arrestees is\nunconstitutional.\"  Walsh, 849 F.2d at 70.  This is established federal law.  \nIn Marriott I, it was determined that defendants' \"change-out\" procedure was\ntantamount to a strip search.  227 F.R.D. at 169 (\"This procedure squarely fits both the\ncommon and legal definitions of strip search . . . Using different terminology, such as change-\nout, does not change the observation of a naked admittee to anything other than what it is - a\nstrip search.\").7  Given that defendants' strip search procedure was applied to each\nmisdemeanor arrestee, without an individual determination of reasonable suspicion, both\nMarriott I and the Second Circuit, in affirming the Marriott I decision, found that there was a\n\"strong likelihood that the strip search at issue here, conducted as a matter of course without\nreasonable suspicion, will be found violative of the Fourth Amendment under Weber and its\nprogeny.\"  Id. at 174 (citations omitted); see also Marriott II,  2005 WL 3117194, at *1\n(\"plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of establishing that the Jail's current strip\nsearch policy is unconstitutional\").\nHere, plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment as to liability, contending that\ndefendants' strip search policy, which was applied to all arrestees that were admitted to the\nJail, absent any determination of reasonable suspicion, is unconstitutional.  They contend that\n6  Indeed, in N.G., the Second Circuit noted that all circuits that have considered this issue have\nreached the same conclusion, i.e., that strip searches performed on arrestees confined for minor\noffenses, absent reasonable suspicion, are unconstitutional.  382 F.3d at 232 (listing cases).\n7  \"'Strip search' is often used as an umbrella term that applies to all inspections of naked individuals.\" \nN.G., 382 F.3d at 228 n.4.  Both the common and legal definitions of strip search show that it is a search\nconducted after a person's clothes have been removed.  The common definition of strip search is \"to search\n(a person) by requiring removal of the clothes.\"  Webster's New World Dictionary 1328 (Victoria Neufeldt &\nDavid B. Guralnik, eds., 3d College ed. 1988).  As a legal term, strip search means \"[a] search of a person\nconducted after that person's clothes have been removed, the purpose usu[ally] being to find any contraband\nthe person might be hiding.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 1378-79 (8th ed. 2004).  \n- 9 -\n\nthere are no issues of material fact as to the unconstitutionality of the strip search, as (1) all\narrestees that were admitted to the Jail (2) were required to remove their clothing in front of a\nCO and take a shower, (3) regardless of the nature of their crime and without any\ndetermination that there was a reasonable suspicion that they possessed contraband. \nPlaintiffs allege that defendants have admitted to these facts, and under Weber and its\nprogeny, defendants' strip search policy is unconstitutional.\nPlaintiffs are correct that defendants have admitted those very facts that make their\npolicy unconstitutional.  In various stages of the litigation, defendants have admitted that the\n\"change-out\" policy applied to all admittees, and that during the procedure, arrestees were\nrequired to remove their clothes in front of a CO and shower.  In their papers, defendants\nstated that \"[t]he arrestee is asked to disrobe in front of the officer and either place their\nclothes in a property bag or hand them to the booking officer and to take a shower . . . An\nOfficer of the same sex, remains in the room during disrobing.\"  (Docket No. 109, Defs.' Mem.\nSupp. Summ. J. at 3.)  Pecora, a former Jail Administrator and defendants' designated Rule\n30(b)(6) deponent, testified at different times that during the \"change-out\" procedure, the CO\nwould do a visual inspection of the arrestee's body.8  (See, e.g., Docket No. 90, Pls.' Ex. I,\nPecora Dep. at 42, 65.)  Further, defendants' counsel gave the following account at oral\nargument: \n8  In their Memorandum opposing summary judgment, defendants attempted to discredit their\nown sworn Rule 30(b)(6) deponent, claiming that his \"knowledge is not the best evidence as it is second-\nhand.\"  (Docket No. 207, Defs.' Opp. Mem. at 12.)  However, as a Rule 30(b)(6) witness, Pecora's\ntestimony is binding upon defendants.  See e.g., Reilly v. Natwest Markets Group, Inc., 181 F.3d 253,\n268 (2d Cir. 1999); Sabre v. First Dominion Capital, LLC, No. 01CIV2145BSJHBP, 2001 WL 1590544, at\n*1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 12, 2001) (\"A 30(b)(6) witness testifies as a representative of the entity, his answers\nbind the entity and he is responsible for providing all the relevant information known or reasonably\navailable to the entity\") (citations and quotations omitted).\n- 10 -\n\nThe Court: \"Now . . . let me understand, the strip search we're talking\nabout in this case is they take off their clothes, put them in a basket, and\ntake a shower while being observed by the corrections officer of the same\nsex; is that right?\"\nMr. Francoeur:9 \"That's correct.\"\nThe Court: \"[The arrestees are] in the nude?\"\nMr. Francoeur: \"Correct.\"\nThe Court: \"And how close is the guard to the person taking the\nshower in the nude?\"\nMr. Francoeur: \"Fairly close.  Four, five feet, I believe . . . \"\n(Docket No. 171, Oral Argument Tr. 5-6, Oct. 22, 2004.)  Additionally, in their depositions, the\nCOs all agreed that they were present when an admittee removed his or her clothing, and the\nadmittee's naked body was visible to them.10\nHowever, despite defendants' repeated admissions that the \"change-out\" procedure\nconsisted of requiring all admittees, without particularized suspicion, to submit to a visual\nexamination of their naked body, as well as a shower, they now claim that the \"change-out\"\ndid not require the admittee to be naked.  They claim that the admissions policy containing the\n\"change-out\" procedure is constitutional as written, and that summary judgment is not\nappropriate.\nAs detailed above, defendants' \"change-out\" policy is contained in 12(A) of the\nadmissions procedure, and specifies that when arrestees do not make bail,\nthe booking officer will escort the inmate to the shower area where the\ninmate will disrobe and place all clothes in the bag provided by the officer,\nand be required to take a shower.  A.  All persons and personal property\nshall be searched in accordance to the law.  Solely to prevent the\nintroduction of contraband to the facility . . .\n9  Mr. Francoeur argued for defendants at this motion argument.\n10  A more detailed account of the COs' behavior during the \"change-out\" procedure is found in\nMarriott I, 227 F.R.D. at 164-66.\n- 11 -\n\n(Docket No. 90, Pls.' Ex. D, ยถ 12.)  Defendants maintain that because the written policy\ndoesn't involve either a command for the arrestee to undress completely or a command for\nthe CO to inspect the naked arrestee, that the policy is constitutional.\nDefendants' argument is seriously flawed.  First, constitutional analysis of a\nprocedure does not stop with analysis of the written policy.  Both parties here have provided\nample evidence that whatever the written policy stated, the procedure that was followed in fact\nby the COs required all admittees to remove their clothes, submit to a visual examination by\nthe CO conducting the \"change out,\" and shower, without the CO making any individual\ndetermination that the arrestee possessed contraband.  Constitutional words cannot erase\nunconstitutional conduct.  \nSecond, it is far from clear that the admissions policy is constitutional as written. \nThe policy calls for the arrestee to \"disrobe and place all clothes in the bag provided by the\nofficer, and . . . take a shower.\"  Id.  In its brief affirmance, the Second Circuit questioned the\nlegality of the written jail policy, writing that \"the written Jail policy itself appears to authorize\nsuch searches without reasonable suspicion, and Jail officers testified at their depositions to\nhaving often conducted them.\"  Marriott II, 2005 WL 3117194, at *1.  Defendants attempt to\nstretch reality by arguing in their papers that it is unclear that any arrestee ever removed all of\ntheir clothes and claiming that the arrestees were allowed to remain in their underwear,\nprovided that the underwear was white.11  This assertion contravenes all of the prior testimony\ngiven by defendants and their officials - no CO, Jail administrator, or other official ever\ntestified about arrestees and their white underwear.  Further, it is ridiculous to claim that an\n11  Defendants now claim that only those arrestees wearing non-white underwear were forced to\nfully disrobe.\n- 12 -\n\narrestee would shower without removing his or her underwear.  The plain language of the\npolicy - disrobe completely and shower, without any individualized determination that the\narrestee is in possession of contraband - evinces an unconstitutional search.  Defendants'\narguments to the contrary are without merit. \nFinally, defendants highlight the fact that their COs had different interpretations of\nthe purpose of the \"change-out\" and that the extent of the visual inspection differed amongst\nthe COs.  They repeatedly claim that summary judgment is inappropriate, citing the language\nof Marriott I stating that \"questions of fact exist as to what the policy and practice is of the Jail\nwith regard to the change-out.\"  227 F.R.D. at 169.  However, they conveniently ignore the\nlanguage in the following paragraphs that negate this very argument - \"[t]he differences . . .  in\nthe extent and purpose of the change-out procedure do not change the fact that the admittees\nare required to strip naked in front of a CO and submit to the observation of their body by a\nCO.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  For constitutional analysis, it does not matter why each CO\nbelieved he or she was conducting the strip search; it matters only that every admittee was\nsubjected to the strip search.  Period.  No questions of material fact remain.  All admittees\nhad to remove their clothing and allow their naked bodies to be viewed by a CO.  Under\nWeber and its settled progeny, such conduct is unconstitutional.12\n12  Plaintiffs move to exclude the testimony of defendantsโ expert witness, David Camp, who was\nretained to โrender expert opinion(s) regarding the constitutionality of certain conditions of confinementโ\nat the Jail.  (Docket No. 203, Pls.โ Ex. N to Keach Affirmation, Rule 26 Expert Report at 1.)  \nExpert witnesses cannot testify as to issues of law.  See e.g., United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d\n1285, 1294 (2d Cir. 1991).  A review of Campโs proffered testimony provided by defendants in their\nresponse papers illustrates that Campโs testimony on this issue would be irrelevant.  It has been\ndetermined that the Countyโs โchange outโ policy is tantamount to a strip search.  See Mariott I, 227\nF.R.D. at 169.  Whether this is an unconstitutional strip search is a question of law; thus, Campโs\ntestimony is unnecessary.  Plaintiffsโ motion to preclude Campโs testimony will be granted.\n- 13 -\n\nThe evidence submitted by the parties shows that there are no questions of material\nfact remaining on this issue.  Defendants' \"change-out\" policy is tantamount to a strip search. \nThe settled law of this Circuit requires particularized suspicion before strip searching any\nperson arrested for a misdemeanor or other minor offense.  Welsh, 849 F.2d at 69.  As\ndefendantsโ policy does not require a finding of reasonable suspicion before conducting the\n\"change-out\" (strip search), and in fact mandated a strip search of all misdemeanor arrestees\nadmitted into the Jail, defendants' policy is unconstitutional.  \nThe County is liable for an unconstitutional policy when that policy was the \"moving\nforce\" of the violation of a constitutional right.  Bd. of County Comm'rs of Bryan County v.\nBrown, 520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 1388 (1997); see also Monell v. Dep't of Soc.\nServs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 2038-39 (1978).  As discussed in Marriott I,\ndefendants are not entitled to the qualified immunity defense.  227 F.R.D. at 170.  Plaintiffs'\nmotion for partial summary judgment on the issue of the liability of the County will be\ngranted.13\nB.  Plaintiffsโ Motion for a Permanent Injunction\nPlaintiffs move for a permanent injunction identical to the preliminary injunction\nissued in Marriott I, claiming that because the Countyโs โchange outโ policy is an\nunconstitutional strip search, they have demonstrated actual success on the merits. \nDefendants oppose this motion, alleging that it would be premature to issue a permanent\ninjunction because material facts remain about the constitutionality of their โchange outโ\n13  Plaintiffs have asked for summary judgment on the issue of liability on the part of the County\nand Sheriff Amato.  However, Sheriff Amato, along with defendants Smith, Snell, Pecora, and Buddles,\nwas released from liability in his official capacity.  Plaintiffs have offered no further guidance as to why\nsummary judgment would be appropriate for Sheriff Amato, in his individual capacity, at this time.  Thus,\nsummary judgment for the liability of Sheriff Amato is not appropriate.\n- 14 -\n\npolicy.  Because plaintiffs are entitled to partial summary judgment against the County for\nliability regarding the unconstitutional โchange outโ policy, their motion for a permanent\ninjunction will be granted.\nThe standard for a permanent injunction is essentially the same as the standard for\na preliminary injunction, except that the moving party, instead of showing a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits must show actual success on the merits.  Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village of\nGambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 12, 107 S. Ct. 1396, 1404 (1987) (citing Univ. of Texas v.\nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 392, 101 S. Ct. 1830, 1832 (1981)).  A preliminary injunction\nshould be issued only where the party seeking such relief shows โthat it is likely to suffer\nirreparable injury if relief is denied [and] also that there is either (1) a likelihood of success on\nthe merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them fair ground for\nlitigation, with a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the [movantโs] favor.โ  Proctor &\nGamble Co. v. Chesebrough-Pondโs Inc., 747 F.2d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 1984); Otokoyama Co. v.\nWine of Japan Import, Inc., 175 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 1999); Eng v. Smith, 849 F.2d 80, 81-\n82 (2d Cir. 1988).  Where \"'a preliminary injunction seeks to stay governmental action taken in\nthe public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme, the less rigorous fair-ground-\nfor-litigation standard should not be applied.'\"  Brown v. Giuliani, 158 F.R.D. 251, 264\n(E.D.N.Y. 1994) (quoting Sweeney v. Bane, 996 F.2d 1384, 1388 (2d Cir. 1993) (internal\nquotation omitted)); Connecticut Dep't of Envtl. Protection v. OSHA, 356 F.3d 226, 230-31 (2d\nCir. 2004) (noting that where a statutory or regulatory scheme is challenged, the more\nrigorous likelihood of success standard must be met).\nIrreparable harm must be imminent, not remote or speculative.  Brown, 158 F.R.D.\nat 264 (citing Tucker Anthony Realty Corp. v. Schlesinger, 888 F.2d 969, 975 (2d Cir. 1989)). \n- 15 -\n\nWhere monetary damages cannot compensate for the injury, the harm is irreparable.  Id.\n(citing Studebaker Corp. v. Gittlin, 360 F.2d 692 (2d Cir. 1966)).  Further, \"the alleged\nviolation of a constitutional right triggers a finding of irreparable injury.\"  Conn. Dep't of Envtl.\nProt., 356 F.3d at 231.\nHere, plaintiffs, as a certified class, have standing to seek prospective injunctive\nrelief.  Marriott I, 227 F.R.D. at 174.  As they allege a violation of a constitutional right, the\nharm is irreparable.  Id.  By succeeding on their motion for partial summary judgment,\nplaintiffs have also demonstrated actual success on the merits of their claim - as previously\ndiscussed, the โchange outโ is an unconstitutional strip search, violative of the Fourth\nAmendment.  Thus, plaintiffs have demonstrated that a permanent injunction is warranted.\nC.  Plaintiffsโ Motion for Interim Attorneysโ Fees\nIn 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 (โsection 1988\"), those civil rights plaintiffs who are considered\nthe prevailing party are provided an award of reasonable attorneysโ fees.  Section 1988\nspecifies that โ[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section[ ] . . . 1983 . . . of\nthis title . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable\nattorneyโs fee as part of the cost.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b).  โ[T]o qualify as a prevailing party, a\ncivil rights plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on the merits of his claim.โ  Farrar v.\nHobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111, 113 S. Ct. 566, 573 (1992).  This can occur without the plaintiff\nobtaining a favorable final judgment following a full trial on the merits.  See Hanrahan v.\nHampton, 446 U.S. 754, 756-57, 100 S. Ct. 1987, 1988-89 (1980).  All the plaintiff must do to\nqualify as a prevailing party is to โobtain an enforceable judgment against the defendant from\nwhom fees are sought.โ  Farrar, 506 U.S. at 111, 113 S. Ct. at 573 (citing Hewitt v. Helms,\n482 U.S. 755, 760, 107 S. Ct. 2672, 2675 (1987).\n- 16 -\n\nโ[A] judgment - declaratory or otherwise - โwill constitute relief, for purposes of ยง\n1988, if and only if, it affects the behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff.โโ  Id. at 506\nU.S. at 110, 113 S. Ct. at 572 (quoting Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1, 4, 109 S. Ct. 202, 203\n(1988).  Thus, โjudicial action other than a judgment on the merits or a consent decree can\nsupport an award of attorneys fees, so long as such action comes with it sufficient judicial\nimprimatur.โ  Roberson v. Giuliani, 346 F.3d 75, 81 (2d Cir. 2003).  The Second Circuit has\nheld that โ[w]hen a party receives a . . . preliminary injunction but never obtains a final\njudgment, attorneyโs fees are proper if the courtโs action in granting the preliminary injunction\nis governed by its assessment of the merits.โ  Haley v. Pataki, 106 F.3d 478, 483 (2d Cir.\n1997) (citing LaRouche v. Kezer, 20 F.3d 68, 75 (2d Cir. 1994)).\nHere, plaintiffs move, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b), for interim attorneysโ fees for\nwork performed up to March 25, 2005, and if their motions for partial summary judgment and\na permanent injunction are granted, from March 25, 2005, to the present.  They allege that\nthey are the prevailing party because their motions for class certification and preliminary\ninjunction were granted in Marriott I; moreover, if their current motions for partial summary\njudgment and a permanent injunction are granted, they argue they have achieved actual\nsuccess on the merits of those claims, which would entitle them to attorneysโ fees for their\nwork performed to the present date.  Defendants oppose, claiming that plaintiffsโ application\nfor interim attorneysโ fees is premature.  They argue that (at the time of filing response\npapers) an appeal of the preliminary injunction is pending, and that the grant of a preliminary\ninjunction was not based on the merits.  Thus, they claim that plaintiffsโ motion for interim\nattorneysโ fees should be denied.\n- 17 -\n\nPlaintiffs must be considered the prevailing party.  As required by Farrar, plaintiffs\nhave obtained enforceable judgments, in the form of injunctions, against the defendants.  In\nMarriott I, defendants were preliminarily enjoined from conducting the โchange outโ procedure,\nbased on a โstrong likelihood that the strip search at issue here, conducted as a matter of\ncourse without reasonable suspicion, will be found violative of the Fourth Amendment.โ 227\nF.R.D. at 174.  The Second Circuit affirmed the injunction.  See Marriott II, 2005 WL 3117194,\nat *1.  On the same day Marriott I was decided, defendants altered their โchange outโ\nprocedure, such that โ[a]t no time will an inmateโs naked body be viewed without reasonable\nsuspicion that the inmate possesses contraband or a weapon.โ  (Docket No. 203, Pls.โ Ex. K.) \nThis is an obvious change in defendantsโ behavior towards prospective members of plaintiffsโ\nclass.  \nMoreover, plaintiffs have today demonstrated actual success on the merits of their\nclaim that defendantsโ โchange outโ procedure is an unconstitutional violation of the Fourth\nAmendmentโs prohibition against unreasonable searches.  They have proved that they are\nentitled to partial summary judgment for liability against the County, and that a permanent\ninjunction against defendants is necessary.  Plaintiffs have obtained multiple enforceable\njudgments against defendants on the merits of their claim.  Therefore, under 42 U.S.C. ยง\n1988(b), they are considered a prevailing party and are entitled to an interim award of\nattorneysโ fees against the County for the work they have performed to date.\nD.  Defendantsโ Motion for a Certificate of Appealability\nDefendants have also filed a separate motion seeking a certificate of appealability\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b), regarding the October 14, 2005, Order denying their motion\nfor partial summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claims for compensatory damages, punitive\n- 18 -\n\ndamages, and attorney fees.  Plaintiffs oppose, alleging that defendants cannot demonstrate\nany of the requirements for certification under section 1292(b), and further claiming that\ndefendantsโ motion for certification is untimely.\nA party seeking leave to appeal a district courtโs interlocutory order, pursuant to\nsection 1292(b), must first obtain certification from that court.  Traub v. Cornell Univ., No. 94\nCV 502, 1999 WL 224804, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 12, 1999); Gilbert v. Seton Hall Univ., No. 94\nCV 1534(SJ), 2001 WL 1602167, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 27, 2001).  In order to certify, the\ndistrict court must find: (1) the order โinvolves a controlling question of lawโ; (2) โas to which\nthere is substantial ground for difference of opinionโ; and that (3) โappeal from the order may\nmaterially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.โ  28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b).14  โDistrict\ncourts have substantial discretion in deciding whether to certify a question for interlocutory\nappeal, see Brown v. City of Oneonta, 916 F. Supp. 176, 180 (N.D.N.Y. 1966) (citing, inter\nalia, DโIppolito v. Cities Serv. Co., 374 F.2d 643, 649 (2d Cir. 1967)), and โshould โexercise\ngreat care in making a [section] 1292(b) certification,โโ Traub, 1999 WL 224804, at *2 (quoting\nWestwood Pharms., Inc. v. Natโl Fuel Gas Dist. Corp., 964 F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. 1992)).  Only\nโexceptional circumstances [will] justify a departure from the basic policy of postponing\n14  Section 1292(b) provides:\nWhen a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under\nthis section, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law\nas to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate\nappeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he\nshall so state in writing in such order.  The Court of Appeals which would have jurisdiction\nof an appeal of such action may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken\nfrom such order, if application is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order:\nProvided, however, That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in\nthe district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall\nso order.\nId.\n- 19 -\n\nappellate review until after the entry of a final judgment.โ  Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro\nEd Altri-Gestione Montonave Achille Lauro in Amministrazione Straordinaria, 921 F.2d 21, 25\n(2d Cir. 1990) (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 475, 98 S. Ct. 2454,\n2461 (1978)).\nDefendants have not demonstrated any of the criteria for certification for\ninterlocutory appeal.  The October 14, 2005, Order denying defendantsโ motion for partial\nsummary judgment does not involve controlling questions of law.  Furthermore, defendants\nhave not demonstrated that there is a substantial difference of opinion warranting immediate\nreview or that certification would advance the ultimate termination of this action.  Accordingly,\ndefendantsโ motion for a certificate of appealability will be denied in its entirety.\nIV.  CONCLUSION\nDefendants' \"change-out\" policy, applicable to all admittees without regard to\nreasonable suspicion, is tantamount to a strip search.  As the settled law of this Circuit\nrequires particularized suspicion before strip searching any person arrested for a\nmisdemeanor or other minor offense, defendants' policy is unconstitutional.  Thus, plaintiffs\nare entitled to summary judgment as to the liability of the County.  \nThe plaintiff class has standing to seek and obtain prospective injunctive relief. \nBecause they have demonstrated actual success on the merits of their claim, plaintiffs are\nalso entitled to permanent injunctive relief. \nPlaintiffs have obtained multiple enforceable judgments against defendants on the\nmerits of their claim.  Therefore, under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b), they are a prevailing party and\nare entitled to an interim award of attorneysโ fees for the work they have performed to date.\n- 20 -\n\nDefendants have not demonstrated that the October 14, 2005, Order denying\ndefendantsโ motion for partial summary judgment as to plaintiffsโ motions for compensatory\ndamages, punitive damages, and attorneysโ fees involves controlling questions of law.  Nor\nhave they demonstrated that there is substantial difference of opinion that warrants immediate\nreview, or that certification will advance the ultimate termination of the action.  Accordingly,\ncertification for interlocutory appeal is unwarranted.\nTherefore, it is \nORDERED that\n1.  Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary judgment as to the liability of the County is\nGRANTED; \n2.  Plaintiffsโ motion to preclude the testimony of George M. Camp is GRANTED;\n3.  Plaintiffsโ motion for a permanent injunction is GRANTED; \n4.  Defendants are PERMANENTLY ENJOINED from conducting a strip search, as\nset forth in the Jailโs โchange outโ procedure, with regard to all persons being placed into the\ncustody of the Montgomery County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations,\nviolations of probation or parole, traffic infractions or other minor crimes, or held on civil\nmatters, without reasonable suspicion that such persons are secreting contraband and/or\nweapons; \n5.  a.  Plaintiffsโ motion for an interim award of attorneysโ fees and expenses against\nthe County is GRANTED;\n     b.  Plaintiffs shall file and serve, on or before April 26, 2006, an appropriate\napplication for interim attorneysโ fees and expenses for work performed up to April 26, 2006; \n- 21 -\n\n       c.  Defendants may file and serve a response on or before May 10, 2006;  \n     d.  The application will be taken on submit; and\n6.  Defendantsโ motion for a certificate of appealability is DENIED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                               \nDated:   April 12,  2006\n             Utica, New York.\n- 22 -",

HURD\nUnited States District Judge\nORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING SETTLEMENT\nWHEREAS, the plaintiffs and defendants have entered into a Settlement\nAgreement intended to resolve the litigation pending in this Court; and\nWHEREAS, the Settlement Agreement, together with supporting materials, sets\nforth the terms and conditions for a proposed settlement and dismissal with prejudice of this\naction against the defendants; and\nWHEREAS, the Court has before it the parties' Joint Motion for Preliminary\nApproval of Settlement and Joint Memorandum in Support of Motion for Preliminary Approval\nof Settlement, together with the Settlement Agreement and supporting materials; and\nWHEREAS, the Court is satisfied that the terms and conditions set forth in the\nSettlement Agreement were the result of good faith, arm's length settlement negotiations\nbetween competent and experienced counsel for both plaintiffs and defendants,\n- 2 -\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n1.  Capitalized terms used in this Order have the meanings assigned to them in the\nSettlement Agreement and this Order.\n2.  The terms of the parties' Settlement Agreement are hereby conditionally\napproved, subject to further consideration thereof at the Final Approval Hearing provided for\nbelow. The Court finds that said settlement is sufficiently within the range of reasonableness\nand that notice of the proposed settlement should be given as provided in this Order.\n3.  Pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 23, the Court conditionally certifies the following\nsettlement class:\nAll persons in the United States who have been or will be placed into the\ncustody of the Montgomery County Jail after being charged with\nmisdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic\ninfractions or other minor crimes, or held on civil matters, and were strip\nsearched upon their entry into the Montgomery County Jail pursuant to\nthe policy, custom and practice of the Montgomery County Sheriffs\nDepartment and the County of Montgomery. The class period\ncommenced on April 29, 2000 and extended until March 25, 2005.\nSpecifically excluded from the proposed class are Defendants, and all of\nthe respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors,\nemployees or assignees.\nThe above class definition supercedes and replaces the class definition contained in the\nCourt's decision and order of March 25, 2005, certifying this action as a class action. All other\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law in that decision and order remain in full force and\neffect, pending the final disposition of this action.\n4.  The Court approves the Class Notice of Settlement attached hereto as Exhibit A\nand the Summary Notice for Publication attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Court also\napproves the Notice Program as set forth in the Appendix of the Settlement Agreement.\n- 3 -\n\nNotice to Settlement Class and Appointment of Settlement Administrator\n5.

Such Notice Program will\nbe completed expeditiously pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Class\nmembers will have sixty (60) days from the Notice Date to opt out, and one hundred twenty\n(120) days from the Notice Date to file claims. Prior to the Final Approval Hearing, plaintiffs\nand/or the Claims Administrator shall serve and file a sworn statement attesting to\ncompliance with the provisions of this paragraph.\n- 4 -\n\n7.
