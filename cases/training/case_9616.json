    "summary": "<p>On June 29, 2004, two females who, earlier, had been arrested for misdemeanors and now were represented, for civil case purposes, by private attorneys from Washington, D.C. and New York, filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the North District of New York.  They alleged that the Schenectady County Sheriff's Department had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all individuals who entered the Schenectady County Jail, including those charged with misdemeanors or held on civil matters, regardless of the crime for which they were charged and without reasonable suspicion to believe that the individuals were concealing weapons or contraband.  Plaintiffs alleged that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and class certification for the thousands of individuals that suffered the same alleged indignities.  Defendants, the County and the Sheriff, answered by generally denying all allegations.</p><p>The case was assigned to District Court Judge Gary L. Sharpe.</p><p>A settlement conference was held on May 17, 2005 before Magistrate Judge Randolph F. Treece.    The case was not immediately settled and discovery continued.  Defendants moved to dismiss the claims of one of the named plaintiffs, Nichole McDaniel, alleging that she failed to appear for scheduled depositions on numerous occasions.  Magistrate Judge Treece recommended that her claims be dismissed and that, should the case settle, the Court would decide whether to forfeit any class claim she had.  McDaniel v. County of Schenectady, 2005 WL 1745566 (N.D. N.Y. Jul 21, 2005).   In November 2005, the Court (Judge Gary L. Sharpe) entered an order staying all activity in the case pending ongoing settlement negotiations.  The stay order was continued several times until the case was ultimately settled.</p><p>On November 29, 2006, the Court preliminarily approved the parties' Settlement Agreement and, later, set the matter for a fairness hearing on August 14, 2007.   Final approval was granted on November 5, 2007, on all issues except attorneys' fees.  Instead of awarding 26% of the settlement as fees, the Court awarded class counsel payment for the time spent at the hourly rates traditionally charged in their native jurisdiction.  McDaniel v. County of Schenectady, 2007 WL 3274798 (N.D. N.Y. Nov 05, 2007).  </p><p>Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, as approved, Schenectady County agreed to institute an appropriate strip search policy and pay $2.5 million into a settlement fund to resolve all class claims.  From the fund, the Court awarded class counsel attorneys' fees in the amount of $343,744.50 and reimbursement of pre-settlement litigation expenses of $10,053.31. The sum of $296,202.19 (the disputed amount of attorneys' fees) was ordered to be placed into an escrow account by the Settlement Administrator, pending further litigation.  The Court approved $12,000 and $1,500 to class representatives for a total of $13,500 in incentive awards. Administration expenses and costs in the amount of $107,233.40 were granted. </p><p></p>",

(Attachments:\n# 1 Unreported Wright Decision)(Keach, Elmer) (Entered: 10/26/2004)\n10/27/2004 7  TEXT ORDER: A Rule 16 Conference is scheduled for November 3, 2004. The\nparties are required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f) to meet and confer before the Rule\n16 Conference and then submit a joint civil case management plan. Rather than\ncomply with that directive and the recommendation from this Court's Chambers,\nthe Court has received separate case management plans with superfluous\nstatements as well as correspondence to the effect of either noncompliance with the\nFederal Rules or a lack of a consensus in the plan. Then a subsequent case\nmanagement plan is submitted with no consensus on any point reflected therein. In\nthis respect both parties have failed to comply with the Federal Rules and this\nCourt's expectations. THIS NONSENSE SHALL CEASE IMMEDIATELY. The\npersonal animus between the litigators will not be tolerated by this Court in any\nform or fashion. There are other provisions of the Federal Rules and the Local\nRules which require the parties to confer in good faith before invoking the Court's\nintervention, and this Court will hold the parties to such requirements. This is a\nwarning: Failure to do so may lead to Sanctions.Further, by a letter dated October\n26, 2004, Plaintiffs' Counsel has asked for a discovery conference as a part of the\nRule 16 Conference. At this late juncture, there is not enough time allotted for the\nConference to address the discovery disputes. A subsequent discovery conference\nmay be required. Nonetheless, the Plaintiffs' Counsel is required to provide to this\nCourt further case law to support Plaintiffs'position on or before November 3,\n2004. The Defendants' Counsel is required to provide a written response to the\nPlaintiffs' letter with case law to support their positions on or before November 3,\n2004.

See dkt. no. 29.\nOn January 31, 2005, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment upon the\ngrounds that the court lacks personal jurisdiction with a motion return date of\nMarch 3, 2005. See dkt. no. 33. On February 2, 2005, plaintiffs filed a request, with\nconsent of the defendants, to extend the response deadline of the pending appeal of\na magistrate's decision until March 5, 2005.

See dkt.\nno. 36. On February 7, 2005, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to Defendants' request\nfor leave to file an amended statement of material facts. Plaintiffs cite that the\nmotion for summary judgment is untimely and patently frivolous. Plaintiffs further\ncontend that the defendants did not seek their consent to this request and ask the\ncourt to strike the pending motion for failure to comply with the local rules. See\ndkt. no. 38. On February 7, 2005, Defendants filed a reply to plaintiffs' opposition.\nDefendants claim the motion for summary judgment seeks dismissal of the\ncomplaint for many reasons, not just jurisdictional grounds. Defendants further\nstate that the scheduling order was not electronically filed until November 30,\n2004, whoich would have given the defendants until January 31, 2005 to file the\npending motion for summary judgment. Defendants conclude with a request to the\ncourt that it exercise its discretion under Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure for an enlargement of time to January 31, 2005. In the interest of judicial\neconomy, the appeal of the magistrate's decision and the motion for summary\n\njudgment will be placed upon U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe's motion calendar\nfor the same motion return date. IT IS ORDERED, that the motion return dates of\nMarch 3, 2005 and March 17, 2005 are hereby ADJOURNED.

The response deadline to the pending motion for summary judgment\nis extended until March 5, 2005. The reply deadline for the motion for summary\njudgment is extended until March 19, 2005. A reply to the response to the appeal of\nthe magistrate's decision will not be allowed without prior written permission of\nthis court.

(Keach, Elmer) (Entered:\n05/27/2005)\n05/27/2005 TEXT NOTICE AND ORDER: The Plaintiffs have asked this Court to convene a\nconference to discuss discovery matters. See Dkt. No. 61 Letter Request filed by\nNichole Marie McDaniel,, Lessie Lee Davies. In order to set up a conference to\ndiscuss these matters, the Court directs the parties to advise the Court of their\navailability for a telephone conference during the week ending June 3, 2005, who\nwill be participating, the telephone number by which they can be reached and, if\nthere are more than four parties participating in the telephonic conference, who has\nthe capability of initiating the conference call. Second, the Plaintiffs raised another\nissue concerning the pending Motion for Sanctions. This Court does not recall the\nMotion being held in abeyance for any reason nor can it locate any such notice or\norder by this Court to that effect. The Court notes however that the Motion was file\non April 5, 2005 (Dkt. No. 57) and the Plaintiffs' time to repond was set at April\n19, 2005. From the docket and the record, it appears that the Plaintiffs had not\nresponded by April 19, 2005. It is also the Court's recollection that the request to\nhold a settlement conference did not occur prior to April 19, 2005, but after that\ndate, as this Court issued a notice of a settlement conference on April 26, 2005. By\nthe time the request for a settlement conference was being made, it appears that the\nPlaintiffs had already defaulted. It is the Court's recollection that only the issuance\nof an order on the Motion was being held in abeyance until the settlement\nconference, and not the opportunity for the Plaintiffs to respond. Therefore, it\nappears that the Plaintiffs are mistaken as to the status of this Motion. Therefore,\nanother issue to be discussed during this conference will be whether the Plaintiffs\nhave a right to serve and file a belated opposition to the Motion for Sanctions. The\nparties should be prepared to address this. Furthermore, the Court directs the\nDefendant to provide a written response to Plaintiffs' May 27, 2005 Letter. Upon\nreceiving Defendant's correspondence and being apprised of the parties\navailability, this Court will set up a telephonic conference. Signed by Judge\nRandolph F. Treece on 5/27/05.

GREAGAN, ESQ.\nAttorneys for the Defendants\n7 Southwoods Boulevard Suite 204\nAlbany, New York 12211\nRANDOLPH F. TREECE\nU.S. MAGISTRATE JUDGE\nORDER\nPresently before this Court are several discovery disagreements.  The parties have served\nand filed, respectively, letter-memoranda framing and discussing their relative positions on the\n\nissues at hand.  On February 9, 2005, a telephonic conference, on the record, was held.  During\nthe telephonic hearing, this Court made rulings, which are incorporated by reference into this\nOrder.  The Court will, nonetheless, summarize those rulings within this Order:\nMcDaniels’ Deposition\nThe deposition of Nicole McDaniels shall occur on or before February 22, 2005 in\nAlbany, New York.  The Plaintiffs shall bear all expenses related to conducting this deposition,\nexclusive of attorney fees.  In the event Ms. McDaniels is not deposed on or before February 22,\n2005, the Defendants may file a motion for sanction without seeking further court approval.\nApplication for Rule 11 Sanctions\nThe Plaintiffs’ application for permission to pursue a Rule 11 motion is DENIED.\nPlaintiffs’ Noticed Witnesses\nThe Plaintiffs has served notice to depose four rank and file employees of the Defendant\nCounty.  These rank and file employees are represented by counsel provided by their union,\nCouncil 82.  These four witnesses shall be deposed on or before March 15, 2005.  The parties\nand Council 82 counsel should decide on an appropriate deposition schedule for these four\nwitnesses.\nDefendants’ Noticed Witnesses\nThe Defendants have served subpoenas on eight to eleven witnesses to be deposed.  It is\npossible that all eleven may not be deposed. At this juncture, the Court will not set a deadline to\ndepose these witnesses.  The Court will permit the parties an opportunity to agree upon a\nschedule to conduct these witnesses’ depositions.  If the parties cannot come to an agreement,\nthey may seek further court intervention and a deadline will be set by the Court.\n\nClass Certification\nOn January 10, 2005, this Court extended the date for serving and filing a motion to\ncertify the class.  Dkt. No. 25, Order, dated Jan. 10, 2005.  Within that Order, the Court also\ndirected the Defendants to disclose the misdemeanor booking sheets.  Id.  However, the\nDefendants have filed objections to the Court’s ruling on this issue with the District Court. \nDistrict Judge Gary L. Sharpe has set a return date on this appeal of June 23, 2005.  Since the\ndisclosure of the booking sheets are relevant to identifying the class, among other things, this\nCourt will stay the filing of the motion for class certification for a date after the District Judge\nhas ruled on the discovery appeal.  The Plaintiffs shall notify this Court of the District Judge’s\nruling on the appeal.  At that point and time, this Court will set a new date for the filing of the\nmotion for class certification.\nPlaintiffs’ undisclosed witness\nPlaintiffs’ counsel identified a client of his who may have relevant information regarding\nthis litigation.  However, the lucidity of this relevance is now an issue for this Court to address. \nThere are several vagaries regarding what she may know and how she may have gleaned this\nknowledge.  Therefore, the Court directs Plaintiffs’ counsel to advise this Court what information\nand how she came to acquire this information to determine if it is relevant to this case, said\ndisclosure to be made on or before February 18, 2005.  If this information requires disclosure of\nattorney-client privileged communication, the attorney can provide such information in an\naffidavit for an in camera review.  If the client does not have a concern about her identity being\ndisclosed to the Defendants, then counsel is directed to share such identification information with\nthe Defendants on or before February 18, 2005.\n\nPlaintiffs’ Supplemental Responses to Defendants’ Interrogatories\nThe identification of a witness is neither protected by the attorney-client privilege nor the\nwork product doctrine.  The request for the names and addresses of witnesses in Interrogatories\nnumber 3-9 shall be provided. FED. R. CIV. P. 26(a)(1)(A), 26(b); MOORE’S ON FEDERAL\nPRACTICE at ¶ 33.70; Doe v. Mercy Health, 1993 WL 377064, at *7: Colorado v. Schmidt-Tiago,\n108 F.R.D. 731, 735.  Further, the Plaintiffs shall identify the relevant documents requested in\nInterrogatories 3-9.  The Plaintiffs shall supplement their answers in Interrogatories 5, 6, 7, 9 and\n10, consistent with the Court’s rulings.  Supplemental responses, consistent with the Court’s\nrulings and this Order, shall be served upon the Defendants on or before February 28, 2005.\nSO ORDERED.\nAlbany, New York\nFebruary 9, 2005",

The County \nfurther agrees not to issue any lien notices pursuant to Social Services Law Section 10 4-b to any \nclass member seeking recovery based upon the settlement in this action.  The County expressly \n12 \n\nreserves its right to  assert a  lien against any class member based upon any cause of action \npossessed by that class member except for claims made in this litigation.  Except as otherwise \nrequired by law, Schenectady County also agrees not to distribute or disclose the identities of any \nindividual who is a member of the settlement class or who makes a claim on the settlement fund, \nincluding disclosing these identities to other County or State Departments of Social Services. \nThis provision does not preclude the enforcement of any liens held by third parties against class \nmembers  where  enforcement  efforts  are  made  independent  of  the  Schenectady  County \nDepartment of Social Services. \nD.

The defendants will provide booking records for all non \nfelony  arrests  for  the  relevant  time  period,  redacting  health  information,  to  assist  in  the \nnotification process.  The plaintiffs are concerned that the booking record addresses may not be \ncurrent and will seek leave of Court for an Order directing the Schenectady County Department \nof Social Services to provide last known addresses for all persons for whom the booking record \naddresses prove to be inaccurate.  The plaintiffs agree that the Settlement Administrator shall pay \nthe  reasonable  hourly  rate for  all  County  staff required  to  respond  to  such requests.  The \nplaintiffs agree that should the Court grant their request for an Order, that any such Order will \n13 \n\nrequire that the disclosure be limited to the Class Counsel  and the Settlement Administrator \nsolely for the purpose of effecting notice to the members of the settlement class and that all such \nrecords  or information provided by the County will be returned to  it,  or destroyed with the \nconsent of the County,  within 60  days  after the  Court provides final  approval  or when the \nappeals  are  exhausted,  whichever  is  later.  The  defendants  believe  that  all  information  in \npossession  of the  County  Department  of Social  Services  is  confidential  and  opposes  its \ndisclosure upon this ground.  The County will, however, obey all Orders of the District Court. \nF.  Partial Distribution Pending Appeal \n1.  In the event that final approval of the settlement is appealed by either party or a \nthird party objector, and if the payment of some portion of the settlement fund is not subject to \ndispute, that undisputed portion of the settlement fund shall be distributed in accordance with \nthis agreement.  If the distribution of some or all of the settlement proceeds are in dispute due to \na pending appeal, the disputed amount will be placed in an insured  interest bearing escrow \naccount and shall not be distributed during the pendency of the appeal.  In the event that final \napproval of the settlement is overturned on appeal, all funds, including interest, will be refunded \nto the Defendants with the exception of the Initial Contribution, detailed in § III(B)(2), and any \nadditional notice and administration costs incurred above the Initial Contribution. \nIV.

It is not from a lawyer.  You are not being sued. \nThis is a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging that corrections officers \nemployed at the Schenectady County Jail engaged in the practice of illegally strip \nsearching all individuals charged with only misdemeanors or minor offenses upon their \nentry into the Schenectady County Jail from June 29, 2001 until June 29, 2005.  The \nproposed settlement does not include individuals who were charged with felony offenses \nat the time of their admission to the Schenectady County Jail, or who were not strip \nsearched when they entered the jail. \nOne benefit of the settlement to class members is that each class member will be entitled \nto an equal share of a $2.5 million settlement fund, after payment of administrative costs, \nincentive awards to the representative plaintiff, and attorneys' fees.  The Defendants have \nalso agreed to enact a new clothing exchange policy as part of the resolution of this litigation. \nVisit the Settlement website at www.scjsettlement.com for additional details about the \nsettlement.  You may also get additional information by calling 1-800 [insert phone#] or by \nwriting to [insert address]. \nYour legal rights are affected whether you act or don't act.  Read this notice carefully. \nYOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT: \nSubmit a Claim Form  You must submit a Claim Form to receive payment \nunder the settlement.  You must submit a Claim \nForm by [insert date] to get any money. \nExclude Yourself  If you exclude yourself from the settlement, you \nwill not be bound by the Settlement or judgment \nand will not be entitled to a cash payment.  You \nwill be free to pursue your claims against the \nDefendants.  This is the only option that allows you \nto bring or be part of any other lawsuit against the \nDefendants in this case about the same legal claims \nthat are advanced in this case.  You must exclude \nyourself from the Settlement by [Insert Date]. \n\nObject  If you do not exclude yourself, you may write to \nthe Court about why you do not like the Settlement \nor the request for legal fees and costs.  You must \nsend a written objection to the Court \npostmarked no later than [Insert Date]. \nGo to a Hearing  You may ask to speak in Court about the fairness \nof the settlement or the request for fees and costs. \nDo Nothing  You get !!!!. payment.  You give up your right to sue \nDefendants on these claims later. \nThese rights and options - and the deadlines to exercise them - are explained in this \nnotice. \nThe Court in charge of this case still must decide whether to give final approval to the \nSettlement.  Likewise, payments to class members will be distributed only if the Court \ngrants final approval of the Settlement and after any appeals are resolved. \nI.  WHY DID I GET THIS NOTICE PACKAGE? \nYou or someone in your family may have been admitted to the Schenectady County Jail \non a misdemeanor, violation, traffic violation, violation of probation or parole, or on a family or \ncivil court warrant from June 29, 2001 to June 29, 2005 and been subject to a strip search. \nThe Court sent you this notice because you have the right to know about a proposed \nsettlement of a class action lawsuit, and about your options, before the Court decides whether to \napprove the settlement.  If the Court approves it and after objections and appeals are resolved, an \nadministrator appointed by the Court will make the monetary payments that the settlement \nallows.  You will be informed of the progress of the settlement. \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are \navailable, who is eligible for them and how to get them. \nThe Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of New York, United States District Judge Gary L. Sharpe presiding.  The case is called \nMcDaniel v. County ofS chenectady, Index No. 04-CV-0757 (GLS)(RFT).  The people who sued \nare called Plaintiffs, and the municipality and municipal officials they sued, the County of \nSchenectady, its correctional employees and elected officials, are called the Defendants. \nII.  WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT? \nPlaintiffs claim in this lawsuit that the County of Schenectady illegally strip searched \nindividuals admitted to the Schenectady County Jail who were charged with minor offenses, in \nviolation of the unreasonable search provisions of the United States Constitution.  Defendants \ndeny that they did anything wrong, and contend that even if they did do anything wrong, \nPlaintiffs are not entitled to any money as a result of being searched. \n\nIII.  WHY IS THIS A CLASS ACTION? \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case Nicole \nMcDaniel and Lessie Davies) sue on behalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of these \npeople are a Class or Class Members.  One Court resolves the issues for all Class Members, \nexcept for those who exclude themselves from the Class.  United States District Judge Gary L. \nSharpe is in charge of this class action. \nIV.  WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendants.  Instead, both sides agreed \nto a settlement.  That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people affected will \nget compensation.  The Class Representatives and their attorneys think the settlement is best for \neveryone who is alleged to have been illegally strip searched. \nV. HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM PART OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nJudge Sharpe decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:  All \npersons who admitted into the Schenectady County Jail during the period June 29, 200 l, through \nand including June 29, 2005, after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, traffic \nviolations, violations of probation or parole, or held on civil matters, and were strip searched \nupon their entry into the Jail.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and \nall of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \nThe Settlement does not cover individuals charged with felony offenses at the time of \ntheir entry into the Schenectady County Jail, anyone who entered the Jail after being convicted of \n(as compared to only being charged with) a crime, or anyone who entered the jail but was not \nstrip searched as part of the Schenectady County Jail's booking procedure. \nVI.  DO I NEED TO PROVE THAT I WAS STRIP-SEARCHED, AND WHAT DOES \nTHAT MEAN? \nNo, you do not need to prove that you were subjected to such a search.  In filling out the \nClaim Form, you will affirm, under penalty of perjury, that you were strip searched, and \nDefendants will accept this affirmation.  Provided that your name is detailed in booking records \nmaintained by Schenectady County, your affirmation will entitle you to payment.  If your name \nis not contained in Schenectady County's records, you may be asked to provide additional \ndocumentation before being allowed to participate in the settlement. \nA strip search occurred when you were ordered to take off some or all of your clothes by \na Schenectady County employee, with that employee watching you undress.  Some members of \nthe Class may also have been forced to bend at the waist or manipulate body parts to allow for a \nvisual inspection.  If you were searched in this manner when you were booked into the facility, \nyou are a member of the class and entitled to  make a claim.  You will need to provide an \n\naffirmation on the Claim Form confirming that one of these  searches was conducted on you \nwhen you entered the Schenectady County Jail \nVII.  I WAS STRIP SEARCHED AFTER RECEIVING A VISIT AND ALSO WHEN \nRETURNING FROM COURT WHEN I WAS IN THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY JAIL. \nDOES THIS MEAN I CAN ALSO MAKE A CLAIM? \nNo.  Searches of this type are permissible.  You can only make a claim if you were \nsubjected to a strip search when you first entered the facility; meaning when your picture and \nfingerprints were taken and you received the jail uniform. \nVIII.  HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER THE CRIME FOR WHICH I WAS CHARGED \nUPON ADMISSION TO THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY JAIL QUALIFIES ME FOR \nINCLUSION IN THE CLASS? \nNew York law creates three distinct categories of offenses: Felonies, Misdemeanors and \nViolations.  Felonies are the most serious crimes, and are usually punishable with incarceration \nin state prison. Felony offenses are usually handled by a County Court Judge, and require \nindictment by a grand jury.  Murder, burglary and rape are examples of felony offenses.  Anyone \ncharged with a felony upon admission to the Schenectady County Jail, even if they were also \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations at the same time, is not a member of the class unless \nthey were, on another occasion, admitted to the Schenectady County Jail solely on misdemeanor \nor violation charges. \nMisdemeanors are minor crimes and are, at most, subject to incarceration in a local jail. \nMisdemeanor offenses are handled by a City, Town or Village Court judge, and do not require \nindictment.  Assault in the Third Degree, Petty Larceny and Unlawful Possession of Fireworks \nare prostitution are examples of misdemeanor offenses.  Anyone charged with a misdemeanor on \nadmission to the Schenectady County Jail is a member of the Class. \nViolations are minor infractions, and are not considered criminal conduct.  While \nviolations can result in brief incarceration in a local jail, they are generally resolved with a fine. \nViolations are handled by a City, Town, or Village Court judge, and do not require indictment. \nDisorderly Conduct, Public Lewdness, Unlawful Possession of Marijuana, traffic violations \n(Driving While Intoxicated, for example) and city code violations are examples of violations. \nAnyone charged with a violation on admission to the Schenectady County Jail is a member of the \nclass. \nThe settlement further allows for individuals to make claims if they were admitted to the \nSchenectady County Jail for violating the terms of their probation or parole, or if they were \nsubject to a civil commitment.  Parole is only assessed if an individual has served time in state \nprison.  If the individual was charged solely with violating parole or probation (for instance, not \nhonoring their conditions of supervision or violating curfew), they are considered to be a \nmember of the class.  If an individual is charged with violating probation or parole and is at the \n\nsame time charged with a felony, they are not a member of the class.  A civil commitment is an \norder from a non-criminal court, usually the Family Court, committing that individual to the \nSchenectady County Jail.  Individuals admitted to the Schenectady County Jail on a civil \ncommitment, for example, a commitment for failure to pay child support, are members of the \nClass. \nIX.  I WAS ADMITTED TO THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY JAIL BUT I CAN'T \nREMEMBER WHAT MY CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE.  HOW CAN I FIND THIS \nOUT, AND HOW DO I KNOW IF THE CHARGE WAS A MISDEMEANOR OR \nVIOLATION? \nThere are several ways for potential class members to determine the nature of their \ncriminal charges.  First, you can review your charging documents, which should reflect both \nyour actual charges and whether the charges were a misdemeanor or violation.  For instance, the \ncriminal complaint filed against you may state \"Assault in the Third Degree,\" a \"Class A \nMisdemeanor,\" or something similar for each separate charge.  If you do not have your charging \ndocument and remember the local court where you were prosecuted, the court clerk will be able \nto help you find these documents. \nIf you need additional help determining whether you are a class member, or of you have \nother questions, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at [insert number). \nYou can still make a claim if you do not remember your criminal charges if you believe \nyou are a member of the Class, but you may be asked for additional information. \nX.  I PLED GUILTY TO A CRIME.  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT BY RIGHT TO \nPARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nIf you were admitted to the Schenectady County Jail solely on misdemeanor or other \nminor charges, as defined above, you can participate in the settlement regardless of how you \nresolved your criminal charges, including if you pled guilty to those charges, provided that you \nwere admitted to the Jail before being sentenced by a court.  For most class members, this would \nmean that they were committed to the Schenectady County Jail after they were arraigned before \na Judge.  If you were sentenced before admission to the jail, meaning you were committed after \npleading guilty or being convicted at trial, you are not a class member. \nXI.  WHAT IF I WAS ADMITTED TO THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY JAIL ON \nMORE THAN ONE OCCASION?  CAN I STILL PARTICIPATE IN THE \nSETTLEMENT? \nYes.  Individuals who were admitted to the Schenectady County Jail on more than one \noccasion during the class period can be members of the class and can recover money.  They can \nonly recover one payment, however, meaning that you will not be provided with extra payments \n\nif you were admitted to the Schenectady County Jail more than one time. \nXII.

WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE? \nDefendants have agreed to pay $2,500,000 to resolve this litigation.  That money will be \nused to: 1) compensate Class Members who have been illegally strip searched; 2) pay for \nnotifying Class Members and administering the settlement; 3) pay incentive awards to the named \nPlaintiff, Lessie Davies, and a proposed intervenor, William Smith; and 4) pay attorneys' fees \nand expenses.  Defendants have also agreed to alter their search policies for new detainees \nentering the Schenectady County Jail.  A complete description of the settlement is provided in \nthe Settlement Agreement.  You can get a copy of the Settlement Agreement by visiting [enter \nwebsite address) or by calling [enter administrator phone number). \nXIV.

Class counsel anticipates, based on claims rates \nfrom other settlements, that all individuals who make a claim on the settlement will receive \nbetween $750.00 and $1,250.00 as a settlement payments.  These amounts are dependent on how \nmany claims are received by the Claims Administrator during the claims period, and are subject \nto change based the number of claims received. \nIf you have any liens in place from the Schenectady County Department of Social \nServices, Schenectady County has agreed not to assert those liens as it relates to payments from \nthis settlement. \n\nHOW YOU GET A PAYMENT- SUBMITTING A CLAIM FORM \nXV.

Everyone who sends in a claim form will be informed of the progress of the \nsettlement.  Please be patient. \nXVII.

After many months of intensive litigation, including extensive discovery \nand motion practice before this Court, and as a result of intensive, arm's length negotiations \nbetween  Class  Counsel  and  Defendants,  including  a  daylong  settlement  conference  before \nMagistrate Judge Randolph F.  Treece on May 17, 2005, the parties have reached accord with \nrespect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class Members, in return \nfor a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in this case against the Defendants (\"Settlement \nAgreement\").  The resulting Settlement Agreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on \niii.  As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a \nproposed Notice Plan and Class Notice, which provided Settlement Class Members notice of the \nproposed  settlement.  The  Notice  Plan  provided  an  opportunity  for  class  members  to  file \nobjections to the Settlement. \nIV.  As of the deadline for the filing of objections, only __ objections were \nfiled.  Given the size of this Settlement, and the notice plan described above, this Court finds that \nthe comparatively low number of  objections is indicative of the fairness, reasonableness and \nadequacy of the Settlement with the Defendants. \nv.  The  settling  Parties  have  filed  with  the  Court  an  affidavit  from \n_______ declaring that the mailing of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the \nNotice Plan, has been completed. \nvi.  The  Court  finds  that the  published  notice,  mailed  notice  and  Internet \nposting constitute the best practicable notice of the Fairness Hearing, the proposed Settlement, \n\nClass Counsel's application for fees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class Notice \nand the Short Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all \nmembers of the Settlement Class, and complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23  of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, the laws of New York \nand any other applicable law. \nvn.  Any persons who wished to excluded from this Action were provided an \nopportunity  to  \"opt  out\"  pursuant to  the  Notice.  All  persons  who  have  validly  excluded \nthemselves from this Action have no rights under the Settlement Agreement and shall not be \nbound by the Settlement Agreement or the final judgment herein. [List attached] \nviii.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the Settlement, the Settlement \nAgreement and releases contained therein, and the Final Order and Judgment, and do not have \nany further opportunity to opt-out of the Action. \nix.  Any  class member who  did not timely  file  and  serve  an  objection in \nwriting to the Settlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiffs' \nClass Counsel's application for fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the procedure set \nforth  in  the  Class  Notice  and  mandated  in  the  Order  Granting  Preliminary  Approval  of \nSettlement,  is  deemed  to  have  waived  any  such  objection  by  appeal,  collateral  attack,  or \notherwise. \nx.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable and \nadequate compromise of the claims against the Defendant in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the Court has considered \nin affirming this Settlement, including: \n\na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nb.  The  Court notes  that  for  settlement  purposes,  this  Settlement has  the \nbenefit of providing relief to Class Members now, without further litigation, under circumstances \nwhere the liability issues are still vigorously contested among the parties to this litigation and \namong the parties to the individual litigation.  This Settlement provides Class Members with a \nsubstantial monetary benefit. \nc.  This Settlement is clearly a byproduct of hard-fought litigation between \nthe parties, and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or Counsel for the \nDefendants. \nxt.  Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendants their \napplication for reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses consistent with the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request and hereby grants the \nrequest. \nxii.  The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair, \na simplified process, and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work out \nany unanticipated problems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS  OF THE FOREGOING  FINDINGS OF \nFACT AND THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING: \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nxiii.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  and  the  subject  matter  of this \nproceeding. \nXIV.  Pursuant to Rule 23 ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following \nSettlement Class is certified for purposes of final settlement: \n\nAll persons who were placed into the custody of the Schenectady \nCounty Jail during the period June 29, 200 l, through and including \nJune 29, 2005, after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, \nviolations  of probation or parole,  or held  on civil  matters,  and \nclaim that they were strip searched upon their entry into the Jail. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and \nall  of  their  respective  affiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees. \nxv.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule \n23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a Class Action is an appropriate \nmethod for resolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for Class certification \nunder Rule 23 are present.  The Class members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined. \nQuestions of law and fact common to all Class members predominate over individual issues and \nshould  be  determined  in  one  proceeding  with  respect  to  all  Class  members.  The  Class \nRepresentatives'  claims  are  typical  of those  of the  Class.  The  Class  action mechanism  is \nsuperior to alternative means for adjudicating and resolving this action. \nxvt.  The Settlement Class Representative, Lessie Davies, is entitled to and is \nhereby  awarded  a  payment  of $12,000.00,  in  recognition  of the  efforts  she  undertook  in \nconnection with this lawsuit.  William Davis, an individual who had planned to intervene in this \naction to assist class counsel, is hereby awarded an incentive award of $1,500.00 in addition to \nhis pro rata share of the settlement fund.  Former Class Representative Nichole McDaniel will \nreceive no incentive award.  All class members who have made claims on the settlement are \nentitled to  receive  their pro rata share of the  settlement fund  after administrative expenses, \nattorneys' fees and expenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the fund. \nxvii.  The Court grants final  approval of the Settlement Agreement, as being \nfair, reasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n\nxvm.  The Courts finds that the request for attorneys' fees is reasonable. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF \nFACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND \nDECREED AS FOLLOWS: \nx1x.  The Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed Settlement is GRANTED. \nxx.  The Settlement Class Representative, Lessie Davies, is entitled to and is \nhereby  awarded  a  payment  of $12,000.00,  in  recognition  of the  efforts  she  undertook  in \nconnection with this lawsuit.

Former Class Representative Nichole McDaniel will \nreceive no incentive award.  All class members who have made claims on the settlement are \nentitled to receive their pro rata share of the  settlement fund  after administrative expenses, \nattorneys' fees and expenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the fund. \nxx1.  The  Class  Counsels'  application  for  attorneys'  fees  and  expenses  is \ngranted. \nxxn.  This  Action and  all  claims  against  the  Settling  Defendant  are  hereby \ndismissed with prejudice, but the Court shall retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction of the \nAction, all Parties, and Settlement Class Members, to interpret and enforce the terms, conditions \nand obligations of this Settlement Agreement. \nxxiii.  All Class members who have not timely filed an opt-out request are barred \nand enjoined from commencing and/or prosecuting any claim or action against the Defendant. \nAny Class member who has not timely filed a request to exclude themselves shall be enjoined \nfrom initiating and/or proceeding as a class action in any forum. \n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: \nHon.

The settlement will provide $2,500,000 to pay claims to \nindividuals who were admitted into the SCJ and charged with misdemeanors, violations, traffic \nviolations, violations of probation or parole, or held on civil matters, and were strip searched \nupon their entry into the Jail. \nThe United States District Court for the Northern District of New York authorized this \nnotice.  The Court will have a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement, so that the \nbenefits may be paid. \nWho's Included? \nYou are a Class Member and could get benefits if you were admitted into the SCJ from \nJune 29, 2001, through and including June 29, 2005, and you were charged with a misdemeanor, \nviolation, traffic violation, violation of probation or parole, or held on a civil matter, and you \nwere strip searched upon your entry into the Jail. \nWhat's This About? \nThe lawsuit claimed that Defendant Schenectady County and its Corrections Officers had \nan unlawful practice of strip searching everyone who was admitted into the Jail.  Defendants \ndeny they did anything wrong.  The Court did not decide which side was right, but both sides \nagreed to the settlement to ensure a resolution and to provide benefits to the Class Members. \nWhat Does the Settlement Provide? \nDefendants agreed to pay a total of $2,500,000 to pay claims to Class Members, pay \nadministrative costs of the settlement, pay an incentive award to the named Plaintiff, and pay \nattorneys' fees and expenses.  Each Class Member who makes a claim will receive an equal \nshare of the portion of the Settlement Fund allocated to pay claims to Class Members, which, \nafter deducting administrative costs, incentive awards and attorneys' fees, will be approximately \n$1,750,000.00.  There are believed to be approximately 6,000 Class Members.  You can only \nmake one Claim, even if you were strip searched more than once. \n\nHow Do You Ask For A Payment? \nA detailed Notice and Claim Form package contains everything you need.  Just call or \nvisit the settlement website, www.scjsettlement.com,  to get one.  To qualify for a payment, you \nmust send in a Claim Form.

Additionally, Class Counsel proposes to allocate up \nto $13,500 of the settlement fund to pay incentive awards to class representative Lessie \nDavies ($12,000) and proposed intervenor William Smith ($1 ,500), who Class Counsel \nmaintain provided assistance to them during the prosecution of this litigation.  Deducting \nfor  estimated  administrative  expenses  of $85,000  and  for  attorney's  fees,  costs  and \nincentive awards, class counsel estimates that there will be approximately $1,750,000 in \nthe settlement fund for distribution to class members. \nDistribution to Class Members \nClass Counsel proposes that approximately $1.75 million of the settlement fund \nbe allocated to pay claims by class members, and that each class member who files a \nvalid claim will receive their pro rata share of the settlement fund when the fund is \ndistributed after final approval.  Based on data received from Schenectady County, Class \nCounsel estimates the class size here to be 6,000 individuals.  Individuals who were \nadmitted to the Schenectady County Jail on more than one occasion will only be allowed \nto file one claim against the settlement fund.  When considering the claims rates achieved \nin similar settlements, Class Counsel estimates that each member of the settlement class \nthat files a claim will receive between $750 and $1,250 as a settlement payment. \nCourt Approval \nAt the time of the final approval hearing, Class Counsel will detail to the Court \nthe final distribution to be made to settlement claimants and the amount to be paid per \nclaim.  Subject to the Court's approval, all proceeds to class members will then be paid \nbased on the final distribution amounts provided at the time of the final approval hearing. \nLAW OFFICES OF ELMEH ROBERT KEACH, III \nA PROFESSIONAL CORFOHATION  2 \n1040 HIVERFHONT CENTEH • P. 0.

Both the\ninspection and the videotaping and the disclosure of the Booking Slips contain either\npersonal or otherwise confidential information or raise a significant security concern\nthat may be the subject of a protective order pursuant to Rule 26(c) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.  Based upon further deliberation it is hereby Ordered:\nBOOKING SLIPS\nBy an Order, dated January 10, 2005, the Defendants are required to disclose\nto the Plaintiffs the Booking Slips for Non-felony, Pretrial Detainees during the\nrelevant period set forth in the Complaint.  The Booking Slips shall be redacted to the\nextent that they exclude disclosure of medical conditions, illness, medications, special\ndiet, and any other information related to these areas of inquiry.  Further, the third\npage of the Booking Slips, a suicide assessment form, shall be redacted as well.\nNotwithstanding that certain confidential information has been redacted, the other\n2\n\ninformation contained therein shall be deemed confidential as well and subject to this\nProtective Order.  To the extent necessary, this information shall be used for this\nlitigation only.\nThat  information  within  the  Booking  Slips  which  shall  be  considered\nconfidential information and subject to this Protective Order  shall include the name,\naddress, date of birth, date of arrival at the Schenectady County Jail Facility, social\nsecurity number, name of next of kin, phone number of next of kin and offense\ncharged,  miscellaneous  information  and  the  remainder  of  the  “inmate  booking\ninformation,” exclusive of that information directed to be redacted, for all non-felony,\npretrial detainees. 1   \nPrior to the Defendants’ actual disclosure to Plaintiffs of the Booking Slips and\ninformation contained therein, these documents shall be marked “CONFIDENTIAL”\nin a manner that will not interfere with the legibility thereof.  \nExcept with the prior written consent of the individual pretrial detainee(s), the\nindividual  pretrial  detainee(s)  stamped  confidential  Booking  Slip(s),  or  the\ninformation contained therein, may NOT be disclosed to any person (including the\nnamed Plaintiffs), except for the attorneys for the parties and those employees and\n1 A non-felony, pretrial detainee shall include those charged with misdemeanors, violations,\nviolation of parole, violation of probation, or held in civil or family court matters.\n3\n\nagents working directly with the attorneys,  for use only in connection with this\naction.  Should a non-felony, pretrial detainee becomes a plaintiff to this action or is\ninterviewed by either party, that detainee may be shown his or her personal Booking\nSlip(s) only.\nAny person to whom information provided under this order is disclosed must\nsign a statement agreeing to be bound by this Protective Order.  The signed statement,\nas annexed hereto as Exhibit “A” shall contain:\n(1) a recital that the signatory has read and understands this Order;\n(2) a recital that the signatory understands that unauthorized disclosures\nof the stamped confidential documents constitutes contempt of court.\nPlaintiffs’ counsel  must maintain a list of all persons to whom the Booking\nSlips and the information contained therein, has been disclosed.  \nThe Defendants may make an application to the Court for the Court to conduct\nan in camera inspection of the Plaintiffs’ list of all persons who may have inspected\nthe Booking Slips and the information contained therein.  Upon such an application\nby the Defendants, the Plaintiffs shall make the list available to the Court within five\n(5) business days of the application.\nTo the extent that these Booking Slips may be used at any one witness or\nparty’s deposition as it may relate to this litigation, said Booking Slips remain subject\nto this Protective Order. The attorneys for the parties must, within fifteen (15) days\n4\n\nafter receiving any deposition transcript, designate pages of the transcript and/or\nexhibits thereto as confidential, if related to disclosure of the Booking Slips or the\ninformation contained therein.  Until the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period, the\nentire deposition will be treated as subject to this Protective Order.  If the attorneys\nfor the parties do not timely designate the confidential information in a deposition\nrelating to the Booking Slips or the information contained therein, then the entire\ntranscript or its exhibits will be treated as confidential until such time this Court may\nlift the protection provided by this Order.  However, the parties need not re-designate\nas confidential a document previously so designated.  \nThe Booking Slips or information contained therein, that has been marked\nconfidential pursuant to this Order, shall continue to be treated as confidential\ninformation at trial.

For at least the past twenty years, the Schenectady \nCounty Sheriff’s Department has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter \nthe Schenectady County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon \nwhich they are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from \nthe  written  procedures  of  the  Schenectady  County  Sheriff’s  Department,  and  was \n  1\n\npromulgated by senior Department officials; specifically, Defendants Harry Buffardi, \nGordon Pollard and Robert Elwell.   \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In fact, a judge in this Judicial \nDistrict has recently held that the blanket strip search policy of the Schenectady City \nPolice  Department  was  unconstitutional  –  a  policy  based,  in  large  part,  upon  that \npromulgated by the Schenectady County Sheriff’s Department.  In short, the policy of \nSchenectady County and the Schenectady County Sheriff’s Department to force those \ncharged with minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the \nSchenectady County Jail is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.  \n  Nichole McDaniel and Lessie Davies bring this action on behalf of themselves, \nand on behalf of a class of thousands of others who were strip searched after being \ncharged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their civil \nrights  and  those  of  the  class  members  they  propose  to  represent.    Both  of  these \nindividuals were charged with misdemeanor and/or violation offenses, and both were \nsubject to strip searches, in violation of their right against unreasonable searches under \nthe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  They seek monetary damages \nfor themselves and each member of the proposed class, a declaration that the Sheriff’s \nDepartment’s policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding Schenectady \nCounty and the Schenectady County Sheriff’s Department from continuing to violate the \nrights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiffs Nichole \nMcDaniel and Lessie Davis complain as follows: \n  2\n\n \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise \nto  Plaintiffs’  claims  and  those  of  proposed  class  members  occurred  in  this  judicial \ndistrict. \n \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff  Nichole  McDaniel  (“McDaniel”)  is  19  years  old  and  resides  in \nSchenectady County, New York.  On or about June 11, 2004, McDaniel was arrested and \nplaced in the Schenectady County Jail on charges of two counts of Petty Larceny and one \ncounty of Endangering the Welfare of a Child (both class A misdemeanors). \n4.  Plaintiff Lessie Davies (“Davies”) is 18 years old and resides in Schenectady \nCounty, New York.  Davies was arrested on or about June 11, 2004 and transported to the \nSchenectady County Jail on charges of one count of petty larceny and one count of \nendangering the welfare of the child (both class A misdemeanors).   \n  3\n\n5.  Defendant County of Schenectady (the “County”) is a county government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of New York.  At all times relevant \nhereto, the County, acting through its Sheriff’s Department, was responsible for the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to \nthe  Schenectady  County  Jail  and  was  responsible  for  the  appointment,  training, \nsupervision and conduct of all Sheriff’s Department personnel, including those working \nin the Schenectady County Jail.  In addition, at all relevant times, the County was \nresponsible for enforcing the rules of the Schenectady County Jail, and for ensuring that \nSheriff’s Department personnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States and of the State of New York. \n6.  The Schenectady County Sheriff’s Department (the “Sheriff’s Department”) is \na County Sheriff’s Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of New \nYork.  Although not a legal entity for the purposes of litigation, the Department is listed \nas a party for the purposes of identification.  At all times relevant hereto, the Sheriff’s \nDepartment was responsible for operating, organizing, overseeing and administering the \nSchenectady County Jail (“SCJ”).  At all times relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriff’s \nDepartment, together with the County of Schenectady, was responsible for the polices, \npractices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the SCJ, \nand  was  responsible  for  the  appointment,  training,  supervision  and  conduct  of  all \nSheriff’s Department personnel, including those working in the SCJ.  In addition, at all \ntimes  relevant  hereto,  Defendant  Sheriff’s  Department,  together  with  the  County  of \nSchenectady, was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Schenectady County Jail, and \n  4\n\nfor  ensuring  that  Sheriff’s  Department  personnel  employed  in  the  SCJ  obeyed  the \nConstitution and laws of the United States and of the State of New York. \n7.  Defendant Harry Buffardi (“Sheriff Buffardi”) is the duly elected Sheriff of \nSchenectady County, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-\ntrial and other detainees over which the SCJ exercises custodial or other control.  Sheriff \nBuffardi’s principal place of business is 320 Veeder Avenue, Schenectady, NY  12305.  \nSheriff Buffardi is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official \ncapacities. \n8.  Defendant  Gordon  Pollard  (“Undersheriff  Pollard”)  is  the  duly  appointed \nUndersheriff of Schenectady County, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the \ntreatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the SCJ exercises custodial or other \ncontrol.    Undersheriff  Pollard’s  principal  place  of  business  is  320  Veeder  Avenue, \nSchenectady, NY  12305.  Undersheriff Pollard is made a Defendant in this action in both \nhis individual and official capacities. \n9.  Defendant Robert Elwell (“Major Elwell”) is the duly appointed Major of the \nSchenectady County Sheriff’s Department and is the officer in charge of the operation of \nthe Schenectady County Jail.  As such, Major Elwell is a policy maker with respect to the \ntreatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the SCJ exercises custodial or other \ncontrol.  Major Elwell’s principal place of business is 320 Veeder Avenue, Schenectady, \nNY  12035.  Major Elwell is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and \nofficial capacities. \n10. Collectively, Sheriff Buffardi, Undersheriff Pollard, and Major Elwell will be \nreferred to as the “Policy Making Defendants.” \n  5\n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n11. Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Schenectady County Jail. \n12. The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nSchenectady County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, \nviolations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil \ncommitments  or  other  minor  crimes  and  were  or  will  be  strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Schenectady County Jail pursuant \nto  the  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Schenectady  County \nSheriff’s Department and the County of Schenectady.  The class \nperiod commences on June 29, 2001 and extends to the date on \nwhich  the  Schenectady  County  Sheriff’s  Department  and/or  the \nCounty  of  Schenectady  are  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise  cease, \nenforcing  their  unconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of \nconducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically \nexcluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their \nrespective  affiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs,  successors, \nemployees or assignees.   \n \n13. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n14. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Schenectady County Jail every month – \nall of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of \nthe proposed class totals at least 5,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil \nrights violated on multiple occasions. \n  6\n\n15. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Schenectady County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindividually. \n16. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’ \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  when  placed  into  the  custody  of  the \nSchenectady County Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly \nestablished law in this judicial circuit. \n17. Plaintiffs’  claims  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  members  of  the  Class.  \nPlaintiffs and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n18. The  representative  Plaintiffs  have  the  requisite  personal  interest  in  the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n19. Plaintiffs have retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiffs are being \nrepresented by Elmer Robert Keach, III; Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger of Berenbaum \n  7\n\nMenken & Ben-Asher, LLP; Gary E. Mason and Charles Schneider of The Mason Law \nFirm, PLLC; and Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo, Waldman and Gilbert, \nLLP.  Mr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who has litigated \na wide variety of civil rights actions before this Court, and has litigated class action \nlawsuits in state and federal courts in five states.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated \nstrip search cases against the Troy City Police Department and the Schenectady City \nSchool District, and was lead counsel in the Rensselaer County Jail strip search class \naction that recently settled before this Court. \n20. Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger are both experienced civil rights attorneys \nfrom New York City, having litigated scores of civil rights cases against a number of \nDefendants, including one prison brutality case presently pending in this District.  Mr. \nMenken and Mr. Rozger have successfully represented many victims of illegal strip \nsearches, including several who opted out of the recent class action litigation against the \nCity of New York.  Mr. Menken and Mr. Rozger were also co-counsel in the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail class action. \n21. Gary E. Mason is one of this country’s premier class action attorneys, with \noffices in Washington, DC.  Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against \nFortune 500 companies in both state and federal court in over a dozen jurisdictions, \nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of \n$ 950 million dollars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high \nprofile class actions, including In Re The Exxon Valdez, In Re Diet Drugs Product \nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation.  In \naddition to his extensive experience as a class action and environmental lawyer, Charles \n  8\n\nSchneider is a former trial attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights \nDivision and has successfully litigated a series of cases involving corrections misconduct.  \nMr. Mason and Mr. Schneider were also co-counsel in the Rensselaer County Jail class \naction. \n22. Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Waldman & Gilbert, have \nextensive  experience  in  state  and  federal  trial  and  appellate  courts,  before  law \nenforcement authorities and in proceedings before the United States Congress.  Cuneo \nand LaDuca have successfully prosecuted several complex class actions, including cases \ninvolving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer protection and products liability \nin state and federal courts throughout the United States. \n23. In short, Plaintiffs’ counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against Schenectady County, the Schenectady County \nSheriff’s Department and the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiffs knows of \nno conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n24. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the \nPlaintiffs’ seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Schenectady \nCounty Jail.  In short, the County of Schenectady, the Schenectady County Sheriff’s \nDepartment,  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  and  Schenectady  County  Corrections \nOfficers acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n25. In  addition  to  certification  under  Rule  23(b)(2),  and  in  the  alternative, \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n  9\n\n26. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of  law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy of strip \nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to \nthe Schenectady County Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed \nduring the class period. \n27. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area.    Furthermore,  the  expense  and  burden  of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n28. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the past \n  10\n\ntwelve years, with the practice being declared unconstitutional in this judicial circuit in \n1986. \n29. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \n  11\n\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n30. The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers  they  supervise,  from  performing  strip  searches  of  arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes unless the officer has reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n31. Upon information and belief, the County of Schenectady, the Schenectady \nCounty Sheriff’s Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the \ncustody of the Schenectady County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the \nnature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n32. Upon information and belief, the County of Schenectady, the Schenectady \nCounty Sheriff’s Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches \n(visual inspection of the vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the \ncustody of the Schenectady County Jail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the \nnature of their charged crime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity \nsearches are collectively referred to as “strip searches.” \n33. The County of Schenectady, the Schenectady County Sheriff’s Department, \nand the Policy Making Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \n  12\n\nreasonable suspicion.  This judicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may \nnot  strip  search  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle being clearly established in 1986 \nby Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986) and recently affirmed by Shain v. Ellison, \n273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied sub. nom, Nassau Co. v. Shain, 537 U.S. 1083 \n(2002).  This Court has also recently held that the blanket strip search policy of the \nSchenectady City Police Department was unconstitutional.  See, Gonzalez v. City of \nSchenectady, 141 F. Supp.2d 304 (N.D.N.Y. 2001).  Upon information and belief, the \nSchenectady  Police’s  written  policy  was  based  on  the  policy  promulgated  by  the \nSchenectady County Sheriff’s Department. \n34. The  Defendants’  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n35. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n36. Upon information and belief, the County of Schenectady, the Schenectady \nCounty  Sheriff’s  Department  and  Policy  Making  Defendants  have  promulgated, \nimplemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice \nor custom of strip searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Schenectady \nCounty Jail and placed into jail clothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, \nor indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the strip \n  13\n\nsearching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the \ncharacteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to \nthe enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches.   \n37. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding every named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Schenectady County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable \nsuspicion.    Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n38. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches – \neach member of the class, including every named Plaintiff – has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \nA.  Nichole McDaniel \n39. Ms. McDaniel’s experience is representative.  On or about June 11, 2004, Ms. \nMcDaniel was arrested and charged with two counts of petty larceny and one count of \nendangering  the  welfare  of  a  child  (both  Class  A  misdemeanors).    Ms.  McDaniel \nsubsequently spent 7 days in the Schenectady County Jail, and was released to probation \nand discharged from the Jail on June 18, 2004.  Ms. McDaniel is presently 19 years old.  \nShe  was  taken  into  custody  by  the  Town  of  Rotterdam  Police  Department.    The \ncircumstances of her criminal charges are that she is alleged to have shoplifted clothing at \n  14\n\nthe Rotterdam Square Mall, and that the act of shoplifting “endangered” her two year old \ndaughter. \n40. At approximately 9:00 PM on or about June 11, 2004, Ms. McDaniel was \ntransported to the Schenectady County Jail on $1,000.00 bail.  Approximately thirty \nminutes  later,  Ms.  McDaniel  was  moved  into  a  room  in  the  booking  area  of  the \nSchenectady County Jail and ordered to remove her clothing one item at a time.  As a \nCorrections  Officer  watched,  Ms.  McDaniel  removed  all  of  her  clothing  except  her \nunderpants and brassiere.  When she hesitated to remove her underclothes, she was told \nthat she could pick the item of underclothing she wanted to take off first.  Ms. McDaniel \ncomplied, and removed both her underpants and brassiere. \n41.  A Corrections Officer then instructed Ms. McDaniel to squat and cough.  Ms. \nMcDaniel initially performed this maneuver while facing the Corrections Officer, and \nwas instructed to turn around to do it again because she had performed this action \nimproperly.  Ms. McDaniel complied, with the Corrections Officer conducting a visual \ninspection of Ms. McDaniel’s vaginal and rectal area.  Ms. McDaniel was also required \nto submit to a search of her mouth as part of this procedure.   McDaniel was then \nprovided with a jail uniform. \n42. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMs. McDaniel was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was \nmade of Mr. McDaniel that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.   \n43. Without stating or implying that Ms. McDaniel is a habitual criminal, Ms. \nMcDaniel has been arrested on a number of occasions in the past.  Consequently, there is \n  15\n\na possibility beyond mere speculation that she will be rearrested in the future, making it \nlikely that she will again be subjected to the same illegal search procedure. \n \n44. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Ms. McDaniel \nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nB.  Lessie Davies \n45. Ms. Davies’ experience is representative as well.  On or about June 11, 2004, \nMs. Davis was arrested on charges of petty larceny and endangering the welfare of a \nchild  (both  Class  A  Misdemeanors).    Ms.  Davies  subsequently  spent  6  days  in  the \nSchenectady County Jail, and was released to probation and discharged from the Jail on \nJune 17, 2004.  Ms. Davies is presently 18 years old.  Ms. Davies was taken into custody \nby  the  Town  of  Rotterdam  Police  Department.    The  circumstances  of  her  criminal \ncharges are that she is alleged to have shoplifted clothing at the Rotterdam Square Mall, \nand, upon information and belief, that the act of shoplifting “endangered” her two month \nold daughter who was with her at the time. \n46. At  approximately  9:00  PM  on  or  about  June  11,  2004,  Ms.  Davies  was \ntransported  to  the  Schenectady  County  Jail  on  $1,000.00  bail.    Approximately  five \nminutes later, Ms. Davies was moved into a room (upon information and belief, where \njail uniforms are stored) in the booking area of the Schenectady County Jail and ordered \nto remove her clothing one item at a time.  As a Corrections Officer watched, Ms. Davies \nremoved all of her clothing except her underpants and brassiere.  When she hesitated to \n  16\n\nremove her underclothes, she was told that “those have to come off too.”  Ms. Davies \ncomplied, and removed both her underpants and brassiere. \n47.  A Corrections Officer then instructed Ms. Davies to face the wall, squat and \ncough.  Ms. Davies complied, with the Corrections Officer conducting a visual inspection \nof Ms. Davies’ vaginal and rectal area.  Ms. Davies was also required to submit to a \nsearch of her hair as part of this procedure.   Davies was then provided with a jail \nuniform. \n48. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMs. Davies was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made \nof Ms. Davies that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  In fact, \nthis was the first time that Ms. Davies was arrested for anything. \n \n49. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Ms. Davies has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n \n \n  17\n\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law -- \n \n50. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and  every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 49. \n51. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n52. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nUnited  States  Constitution.    Simply  put,  it  was  not  objectively  reasonable  for \nSchenectady County Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiffs and class members \nbased on their arrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively \nreasonable  for  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  to  order/direct  Schenectady  County \nCorrections Officers to conduct such searches.   \n53. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the County of Schenectady and the Schenectady County Sheriff’s Department.  As \nsuch, the County of Schenectady is directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiffs \nand members of the Class. \n54. Upon information and belief, Sheriff Buffardi, Undersheriff Pollard and Major \nElwell are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the \n  18\n\noperation of the Schenectady County Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of \nthe strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Buffardi, Pollard and Elwell \nare each individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of \nthe Class.    \n55. Sheriff Buffardi, Undersheriff Pollard and Major Elwell knew that the SCJ’s \nstrip search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to \ndeprive Plaintiffs and members of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n56. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n57. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs have been irreparably injured. \n \n  19\n\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n \n58. Plaintiffs  incorporate by reference and reallege each and  every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 57. \n59. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Schenectady  County  Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the County of Schenectady and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Schenectady  County  Jail  without  any \nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n60. Plaintiffs and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Schenectady and the \nSchenectady County Sheriff’s Department to be unconstitutional. \n \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n61. Plaintiffs  incorporate by reference and reallege each and  every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 60. \n62. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Schenectady  County  Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the County of Schenectady and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Schenectady  County  Jail  without  any \n  20\n\nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n63. Upon  information  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in  place  at  the \nSchenectady  County  Jail,  with  new  and/or  prospective  members  of  the  Class  being \nsubjected to the harms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs.   \n64. The  continuing  pattern  of  strip  searching  individuals  charged  with  minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n65. Plaintiffs demand that the County of Schenectady, the Schenectady County \nSheriff’s  Department,  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  and  Schenectady  County \nCorrections Officers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the \ncustody of the Schenectady County Jail absent any particularized suspicion that the \nindividuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary \nand permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \n \n \n \n  21\n\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n66.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n67. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Schenectady and \nthe Schenectady County Sheriff’s Department have no respect for the civil rights of \nindividual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is \nnecessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to them that \nthe requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government officials in \nSchenectady County. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n68. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Nichole McDaniel and Lessie Davies, on behalf of \nthemselves  and  on  behalf  of  a  class  of  others  similarly  situated,  request  that  this \nHonorable Court grant them the following relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs’ First \nCause  of  Action  detailed  herein,  awarding  Compensatory  Damages  to  each  named \nPlaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury \nand/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis.  \n  22\n\n\n\n \nBruce E.

Hudacs, et aI, 1996 WL 590735 (NDNY 1996) \nSnaIl v. The City of New York, 1998 WL 960296 (EDNY 1998) \n\nPreliminary Statement \n1.  Defendants  Harry  Buffardi  and  Robert  Elwell  move  for  partial \nsummary judgment to dismiss all claims in the plaintiffs' Complaint alleging individual \nand personal liability against these defendants, as opposed to the claims contained in the \nComplaint alleging wrongdoing in their professional capacities, upon the grounds that \ndefendants  Hany Buffardi  and  Robert Elwell  were never personally served  with  the \nSUlnmons and COlnplaint and therefore jurisdiction has not been obtained over them in \ntheir individual capacities. \n2.  Because the Complaint makes no allegations of wrongdoing on the \npart of these defendants in their individual capacities and there is no evidence that these \nindividual defendants played any role in the activities which give rise to  the plaintiff's \nCon1plaint; the defendants are entitled to dismissal of the Complaint against them in their \nindividual capacities. \n2 \n\nStatelnent of facts. \nThe Court is respectfully referred to the Affidavits of William J. Greagan, \nEsq., Hany Buffardi, Gordon Pollard, and Robert Elwell, and the Statement of Material \nFacts. \nArgument \nI.  Standard for summary judgment. \nSummary judgment is appropriate where \"there is no genuine issue as to \nany material facts  ... the moving party is  entitled to a judgment as  a matter of law\" \n(Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).  The moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the \nCourt  of the  basis  for  its  motion,  and  identifying  those  portions  of the  \"pleadings, \ndepositions,  answers  to  intenogatories,  and  adlnissions  on  file  together  with  any \naffidavits,  if any,  which  it  believes  demonstrates  the  absence  of a  genuine  issue  of \nmaterial fact\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986).  \"If \nthe moving party meets the initial burden of showing the absence of the material and \ntriable issue of facts,  the burden then Inoves to the opposing party, who Inust present \nsignificant probative evidence to support its claim or defense\".  Intel Corp. v.  Hartford \nnd \nAccident & Indem. Co., 952 F.2 1551, 1558 (9th Cir. 1991), quoting Richards v. Nielsen \nnd \nFreight Lines, 810 F.2 898, 902 (9th Cir. 1987). \nThe non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and designate facts \nshowing an issue of material fact for trial.  Celotex Corp., supra, 477 U.S. at 322-323. \nWhether a fact is material is governed by the substantive law governing a claim.  Burt \nRigid Box v.  Travelers Prop. Cas. Corp., 302 F.3d 83,90 (2nd  Cir.  2002).  The \"mere \n3 \n\nexistence  of a  scintilla  is  evidence\"  in  support  of the  non-moving  party's  claim  is \ninsufficient to defeat summary judgment.  Anderson v.  Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986).  The party opposing a motion for summary judgment \ncannot stand on mere allegations in its pleadings, or simply assert that it will be able to \ndiscredit the moving party's evidence at trial.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); see also T.W. Elec. \nServo Inc. V. Pacific Elec. Contractor's Ass'n, 809 F.2nd 626,630 (9th Cir. 1987). \nThe party opposing the motion must do more than show that there is some \nmetaphysical doubt as  to  the evidence.  Matsushita Elec.  Indus.  Co.  v.  Zenith Radio \nCorp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (1986).  Thus, to avoid summary judglTIent, the \nnon-moving  party  must  come  forward  with  specific  facts  and  significant  probative \nevidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of facts for trial.  Celotex Corp., \nsupra, 477 U.S. at 327. \nII.  Plaintiffs failed  to  personally serve Defendants Buffardi and \nElwell. \nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure directs how service is to be made. \nThe 4( c)( 1) requires that: \n\"A SUmlTIOnS shall be served together with a \nComplaint;  the  plaintiff  is  responsible  for \nservice  of  the  Summons  and  Complaint \nwithin  the  time  allowed under subdivision \n(m)  and  shall  furnish  the  person  affecting \nservice  with  the  necessary  copies  of  the \nSummons and Complaint.\" \nRule 4(e) provides that: \n\"Unless otherwise provided by Federal Law, \nservice  upon  an  individual  from  whom  a \nwaiver has not been obtained and filed, other \nthan an instant and incompetent person, may \n4 \n\nbe  affected  in  any  judicial  district  of the \nUnited States: \n(1)  Pursuant to  the  law  of the  state  in \nwhich the District Court is located or \nin which service is  effected, for the \nservice  of  the  Summons  upon  the \ndefendant upon an action brought in \nthe  Court of general jurisdiction of \nthe State; or \n(2)  By  delivering  a  copy  of  the \nSumlnons  and  Complaint  to  the \nperson  individually  or  by  leaving \ncopies  thereof  at  the  individual's \ndwelling,  house  or  usual  place  of \nabode with some person of suitable \nage  or  discretion  then  residing \ntherein or by delivering a copy of the \nSummons and COlnplaint to an agent \nauthorized by appointment or by law \nto receive service of process\". \nRule 4(m) provides that: \n\"If service of the  Summons  and  COlnplaint  is  not made \nupon  the  defendant  within  120  days  of  filing  of  the \nComplaint, the Court can on Inotion or on its own initiative \nafter notice to the plaintiffs, shall disiniss the action without \nprejudice  as  to  the  defendant  or  direct  that  service  be \neffected  within  a specific period time;  provided that the \nplaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the Court shall \nextend the time for service for an appropriate period.  This \nsubdivision does not apply to service in a foreign country \npursuant to subdivision (f) or (j)( 1). \nNew  York  Civil  Practice  Law  and  Rules  Section  308 \nprescribes methods by which person service may be made upon a natural \nperson: \n5 \n\n\"1.  By delivering the Summons within the State of the \nperson to be served; or \n2.  By delivering the Summons within the State to  a \nperson of suitable age and discretion at the actual \nplace of business, dwelling or usual place of abode \nof the person to be served and by either mailing the \nSummons to the person to be served at his or her \nlast lmown residence or by mailing the Summons by \nfirst class mail to the person to be served at his or \nher actual place of business in an envelope bearing \nthe  legend  \"Personal  and  Confidential\"  and  not \nindicating on the outside thereof by return address \nor  otherwise  that  the  communication  is  froin  an \nattoD1ey or concerns an action against the person to \nbe served, such delivery and mailing to be effected \nwithin 20 days of each other; proof of service shall \nbe filed with the clerk of the Court designated in the \nSummons within 20 days from either such delivery \nor mailing, whichever is effected later; service shall \nbe  complete  10  days  after  such  filing;  proof  of \nservice  shall  identify such  person of suitable  age \nand discretion and state the date, tiine and place of \nservice,  except in Inatriinonial  actions  for  service \nhereunder  may  be  made  in  accordance  with  the \nprovisions  of  subdivision  (a)  of  Section  Two \nHundred  Thirty  Two  of  the  Domestic  Relations \nLaw; or \n3.  By delivering the Suminons within the State to an \nagent  for  service  of the  person  to  be  served  as \ndesignated under Rule 318, except in matrimonial \nactions  where  service  hereunder  may  be  Inade \npursuant to an Order made in accordance with the \nprovision  of  subdivision  (a)  of  Section  Two \nHundred  Thirty  Two  of  the  Domestic  Relations \nLaw; \n4.  If service under paragraphs one and two cannot be \nmade with due diligence by affixing the Summons \nto  the door of either the  actual place of business, \ndwel1 ing place or usual place of abode within the \nState  of the  person  to  be  served  and  by  either \nmailing the summons to  such person at his or her \nlast known address or by mailing the Summons by \n6 \n\nfirst class mail to the person to be served at his or \nher actual place of business in an envelope bearing \nthe  legend  \"Personal  and  Confidential\"  and  not \nindicating on the outside thereof, by return address \nor  otherwise,  that  the  communication  is  from  an \nattorney or concerns an action against the person to \nbe served, such affixing and mailing to be effected \nwithin 20 days of each other; proof of such service \nshall be filed with the Clerk of the Court designated \nin  the  Summons  within  20  days  of  either  such \naffixing  or  mailing,  whichever  is  effected  later; \nservice shall be complete 10 days after such filing \nexcept in matrimonial actions for service thereunder \nmay be made pursuant to  an Order in accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of subdivision  (a)  of Section \nTwo  Hundred Thirty Two  of Domestic Relations \nLaw; \n5.  In such manner as the Court, upon motion without \nnotice,  directs,  that service  is  impracticable under \nparagraphs one, two and four of this section. \n6.  For  purposes  of  this  Section,  \"actual  place  of \nbusiness  shall  include  any  location  that  the \ndefendant,  through  regular  solicitation  or \nadvertisement,  has  held  out  as  its  place  of \nbusiness\". \" \nReview of the Affidavits of Harry Buffardi and Robert Elwell and the Docket in \nthis  action show that there  is  no  evidence that  the  plaintiffs personally served Harry \nBuffardi or Robert Elwell in accordance with either Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure or Section 308 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. \nAccording to the Docket, the plaintiff commenced this action by the filing of a \nSummons and Complaint on July 19, 2004.  Pursuant to Rule 4(m), the time in which to \neffect service under the Federal Rules expired on November 16, 2004.  Also, as set forth \nin the Affidavits of Robert Elwell and Harry Buffardi, no service has been made upon \n7 \n\nthem by substituted service in accord with CPLR §30S.  The tilne in which to do so has \nexpired.  On this basis alone, defendants Harry Buffardi and Robert Elwell are entitled to \na dismissal of all claims held against them in this action in their individual capacities. \nReview of the Complaint delnonstrates that it is devoid of any factual basis for the \nilnposition of liability against defendants  Hany Buffardi,  Gordon Pollard and  Robert \nElwell in their individual capacities.  There is no factual allegation of any act on the parts \nof defendants  Hany  Buffardi,  Gordon  Pollard  or  Robert  Elwell  in  their  individual \ncapacities against the plaintiffs, contained in the Complaint. \nIII.  Defendants Buffardi, Pollard and Elwell are not liable in their \nindividual capacities. \nThe  plaintiffs'  Complaint  broadly  alleges  that  the  individual  plaintiffs  were \nillegally strip searched in the course of the booking process at the Schenectady County \nJail.  On December 7, 2004 defendants served Notices to Admit pursuant to Rule 36 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 36(a) provides in relevant part that: \n\"Each  matter  of  which  an  admission  is  requested  shall  be \nseparately set forth.  The matter is admitted unless, within 30 days \nafter service of the request, or within such shorter or longer tilne as \nthe  Court may allow,  or as  the parties may agree to  in  writing, \nsubject to Rule 29, the party to whom the request is directed serves \nupon  the  party  requesting  the  admission  a  written  answer  or \nobjection addressed to  the matter,  signed by the party or by the \nparties  attorney.  Neither  party  has  objected  to  the  admissions \nsought herein.  The time to do so has passed.\" \nReview  of the admissions  of Lessie Davies,  the Affidavits  of Hany Buffardi, \nGordon Pollard and Robert Elwell and a review of the Complaint, shows that none of \nthese  individual  defendants  had  anything  to  do  with  booking  or  alleged  searches \ninvolving plaintiffs Nichole Marie McDaniel or Lessie Lee Davies. \nS \n\nSince there is no genuine issue of material fact relating to liability on the part of \nHany Buffardi,  Gordon Pollard,  or Robert Elwell  in  their  individual  capacities,  and \nbecause Defendant Hany Buffardi and Robert Elwell were never personally served with \nthe Sunlmons and Complaint in this action, these defendants are entitled to a dismissal of \nthe Complaint against thelTI in their individual, as opposed to their official capacities. \nIV.  Plaintiffs claims against Buffardi, Pollard and Elwell in their \nofficial capacity must be dismissed because the plaintiffs have \nalleged a Monell type claim against the County. \nBecause the claims here against the individual defendants in their official \ncapacities are functionally equivalent to the plaintiffs' clailTIS against the County, the \nclailTIs asserted against Mssrs. Buffardi, Pollard, and Elwell in their official capacities \nshould be dismissed. Citing the Supreme Court in Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159 \n(1985), the Northern District has stated: \nA claim against a municipal officer acting in his official \ncapacity is, in reality, a claim against the municipal entity \nitself. Thus, plaintiff's claims against the various police \nofficers in their official capacities are to be treated as a suit \nagainst the [municipality]. In that regard, plaintiff's claims \nagainst the defendants in their official capacities are \ndislTIissed. \nPritzker v. City of Hudson, 26 F.Supp.2d 433 (NDNY 1998) (internal citation omitted). \nBased upon the distinction between official and personal capacity claims, \"district courts \nhave dislTIissed official-capacity claims against individuals as redundant or unnecessary \nwhere Monell claims were also asserted against the entity.\" SnaIl v. The City of New \nYork, 1998 WL 960296, *4 (ED NY 1998). See also Fox v. City of New York, 2004 WL \n856299, *13 (SDNY 2004) (citing Kentucky v. Graham, supra); Corona v. Lunn, 2002 \n9 \n\nWL 550963, *5  (SDNY 2002) (\"[S]ince clail11s against state officers acting in their \nofficial capacities' generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an \nentity of which an officer is an agent, summary judgment also will be granted in favor of \nLunn on the official capacity claims asserted against her.\" [internal citations omitted]); \nAzzan1 v. The Travelers Insurance Company, 2000 WL 151906, *2 (NDNY 2000) \n(\"Plaintiff's official-capacity claims against Hopkins and Foody effectively nan1e City as \nthe real party in interest. Consequently, an official-capacity suit is, in all respects other \nthan nat11e, to be treated as suit against the entity.\" [internal citation and quotation \nomitted]); Wallikas v. Harder, 67 F.Supp.2d 82, 83 (NDNY 1999) (\"In general, claims \nagainst l11unicipal officials in their official capacities are really claims against the \nmunicipality and, thus, are redundant when the municipality is also named as a \ndefendant.\"); Riley v. Town of Bethlehem, 44 F.Supp.2d 451,466-467 (NDNY 1999) \n(\"It is apodictic that clail11s against an individual in his official capacity are to be treated \nas clail11s against the municipality.\"); LaCorte v. Hudacs, et al., 1996 WL 590735, *4-5 \n(NDNY 1996) (\"A suit against a municipal officer in her official capacity is functionally \nequivalent to a suit against the entity of which the officer is an agent. ... Consequently, it \nwould be redundant to allow this suit to proceed against Rensselaer County and the \nindividuals in their official capacities. \"). \nHere, plaintiffs' attorneys left little doubt regarding the nature of \nplaintiffs' clail11s. At a telephone conference held November 30,2004 before Magistrate \nJudge Randolph F. Treece, plaintiffs' attorney, Elmer R. Keach, III represented on the \nrecord that this claim is not against individuals in any capacity, with the possible \n10 \n\nexception of the cOlTections officer that strip searched the plaintiffs in the event class \ncertification is denied, but against the n1unicipality: \nThat's not how this case is pled, it's not how it's going to \nbe pled, and, you know, I can affinnatively n1ake that \nrepresentation to the Court, that we're not gonna go out and \nn1ake individual cOlTections officers defendants in this case. \nIt's a class action against the County for a practice; it's an \noverarching Monell clailn. \nTranscript 11130/04 at 11. \nMagistrate Treece restated the plaintiffs' assertions without objection froln \nplaintiffs' attoll1eys: \"Mr. Greagan, you've heard from Mr. Keach that this is a Monell \nclaim, it is against the County, it's not against any individual, and he's making this \naffirmative representation that he intends not to hold any individual responsible.\" \nTranscript 11130/04 at 12. Later in the conference, Mr. Keach and Magistrate Treece \nengaged in the following exchange: \nMr. Keach:  I will state on the record with \nregards to any individual corrections officers that are \ncontacted in an ex parte sense, we will not do so. We will \nnot sue those cOlTections officers. \nWe have no interest to sue individual cOlTections officers. \nThe only interest that my colleagues and I have is to stop \nthe practice  which still continues, by the way - and hold \nSchenectady County, Schenectady County as compared to \nindividuals, financially responsible for what - for violating \nthe rights of thousands of individuals. That's the goal of \nthis litigation, that's the goal that's communicated in the \ncomplaint, and we have no interest to sue individual \ncOlTections officers here. \n11 \n\n* * * \nThe Court:  So, Mr. Keach, if I understand this, we go \nforward to determine class certification. Let's presulne that \nyou do not get it. Then you will proceed to prosecute this \non behalf of the named plaintiffs and that there is a \npossibility with regards to those two of maybe including \nother parties. But if you get your class certification, this is a \nMonell claim going right after the County? \nMr. Keach:  That sums up the plaintiffs' \nposition perfectly, your Honor. \nTranscript 11130/04 at 19 - 20. \nBecause the plaintiffs have affinnatively represented on the record and to \nthe Court that their claims, insofar as asserted against individuals are, in effect, claims \nagainst the County, and because of case law establishing the redundancy of such claims, \nthe claims against Mssrs. Buffardi, Pollard, and Elwell in their official capacities should \nbe dislnissed. Because the plaintiffs have affirmatively represented to the Court they have \nno intention of pursing claims against Mssrs Buffardi, Pollard, and Elwell personally, \nclaims against these individuals in their personal capacity should also be dismissed. \nConclusion. \nSince Harry Buffardi and Robert Elwell were never personally served in \nthis  action,  the  Court  has  no  jurisdiction  over  these  defendants  in  their  individual \ncapacities.  With respect to the defendants  Buffardi, Pollard and Elwell, the plaintiffs' \nadmissions and the defendants' Affidavits show that there is no basis for the imposition \nof liability on the part of these defendants in their individual capacities or official \n12 \n\ncapacities and, therefore, the Complaint against them should be dismissed on the merits \nand with prejudice. \nDATED:  Albany, New York \nJanuary 31, 2005 \nBar Roll No. 101847 \nGoldberg Segalla LLP \nAttorneys for Defendants \n7 Southwoods Boulevard, Suite 204 \nAlbany, New York 12211 \nTel:  (518) 463-5400 \nFax:  (518) 463-5420 \nEmail: wgreagan@ goldbergsegalla.colTI \n13 ",

INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff Lessie Davies filed the above-captioned class action lawsuits against Defendants\nHarry Bufardi, Gordon Pollard, and Robert Elwell, alleging that Defendants had violated her\nConstitutional rights under color of state law by illegally strip searching her, and others similarly\nsituated, upon admission into the Schenectady County Jail, and that Defendants maintained an\nunconstitutional policy of strip searching all pre-trial detainees who were admitted into the\nSchenectady County Jail absent any particularized suspicion that they possessed weapons or other\ncontraband.\nSubstantial settlement negotiations have taken place between the Parties, including a\nmediation conducted by Magistrate Judge Treece, and, as a result, the parties have reached a\nSettlement Agreement, which was executed on July 31, 2006.  Plaintiffs now move for preliminary\napproval of the settlement. Accordingly, at this preliminary stage of the settlement process, Plaintiffs\nrespectfully request that the Court: (i) grant preliminary approval of the proposed settlement; (ii)\ncertify the Settlement Class pursuant to the provisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); (iii) schedule a\nfairness hearing to consider final approval of the settlement; (iv) direct that notice of the proposed\nsettlement and final approval hearing be provided to absent class members in a manner consistent\nwith the Settlement Agreement and the Notice Plan, and in the form and content substantially as set\nforth in the Settlement Agreement; and (v) enter the proposed Order for Preliminary Approval filed\ncontemporaneously herewith, a copy of which is also Exhibit D to the Settlement Agreement.  \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nPlaintiff filed this lawsuit on June 29, 2004.  Discovery commenced, with the Plaintiffs\n1\n\ntaking the depositions of Defendant County of Schenectady, pursuant to F.R.C.P. 30(b)(6), and\nSchenectady County correction officers Jerry Carlos, Michele Bergeron, Sherri Crandall, Judith\nEldred, and Dean Harper.  Defendants deposed Ms. Davies.  The Plaintiffs also obtained hundreds\nof pages of documentary discovery, including numerous internal policies and procedures of the\nSchenectady County Jail.  Discovery in the case was extremely contentious, with several disputes\nrequiring the intervention of Magistrate Treece.  Those included the Plaintiff’s right to informally\nspeak with individual corrections officers (docket entries 9-10, 13), the Plaintiff’s access to the SCJ\nfor an inspection and the right to obtain production of the SCJ booking sheets (docket entries 18-24),\nand the applicability of the work-product privilege to the conversations between Plaintiff’s counsel\nand non-party witnesses (docket entries 28, 30).  These disputes and others required numerous\ndiscovery conferences before Magistrate Treece, with several disputes being appealed to this Court\npursuant  to  F.R.C.P.  72.    Defendants  moved  for  partial  summary  judgment,  based  on  the\napplicability of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) to this case.  That motion was denied.\n(Docket entry 77).  Defendants’ application for permission to file an immediate appeal of that\ndecision to the Second Circuit was pending at the time the parties reached an agreement in principle\nto settle the case on a class-wide basis.  The negotiation process was facilitated by a settlement\nconference before Magistrate Treece on May 17, 2005 that led to the parties ultimately reaching an\nagreement.    \nIII. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nThe settlement agreement, signed on July 31, 2006, (exhibit 1 to Rozger affirmation)\nprovides that the Defendants will create a fund to compensate the settlement class members for the\nviolation of their Constitutional rights.  The Settlement Class is defined as follows:\nAll persons who were placed into the custody of the Schenectady County Jail during\n2\n\nthe period June 29, 2001, through and including June 29, 2005, after being charged\nwith misdemeanors, violations, traffic violations, violations of probation or parole,\nor held on civil matters, and were strip searched upon their entry into the Jail.\nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their\nrespective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.\nThe size of the Settlement Class is approximately 5,500 persons1.  The Settlement Agreement calls\nfor  the  creation  of  a  Settlement  Fund  totaling  two  million,  five  hundred  thousand  dollars\n($2,500,000.)  That amount is allocated as follows: approximately $1,750,000 for distribution to\nclass members, $650,000 in attorney’s fees, $13,500 in incentive awards for the named and proposed\nnamed Plaintiffs, and approximately $86,500 in notice and administration costs.  Each Settlement\nClass member who makes a claim will receive a pro rata share of the $1,750,000 distribution\namount, with the entire distribution amount to be distributed to the class.  \nIn addition, the settlement agreement provides that the Defendants will change their strip\nsearch policy so that individuals being booked into the Schenectady County Jail will not be strip-\nsearched absent reasonable suspicion that such individual is secreting weapons or contraband.  This\nrepresents a clear victory for the class, and will benefit  any other individual who will enter the SCJ\nin the future.  The revised policy, which is annexed as Exhibit G to the proposed Settlement\nAgreement,  is a detailed, workable policy that provides ample guidance for SCJ correction officers.\nIt provides, inter alia, that a strip search upon admission will only take place if there is reasonable,\nindividual suspicion that the arresstee is concealing contraband, and that  the officer performing the\nsearch must first obtain authorization for the search from the Unit Supervisor, and must document\nthe reasons for, and results of, the strip search on a standardized form.  The implementation of this\n1This estimate is based on the Sheriff’s Annual Report of the population of the SCJ for the years\n2001 - 2004.  (Exhibit 2).  This number may overstate the class size, since it may include\nindividuals who were admitted into the SCJ more than once.  \n3\n\npolicy will ensure that the admissions process at the SCJ will comport with Constitutional standards,\nand is the fulfillment of a major purpose of this lawsuit.  \nPlaintiffs’ Class Counsel respectfully submit that the terms of this settlement are fair,\nadequate, and reasonable for the Settlement Class and that the requirements for final approval will\nbe satisfied.  In considering preliminary approval, however, the only issue before the Court is\nwhether the proposed settlement is within the range of what may be found to be fair, adequate, and\nreasonable, so that class members can be notified of the proposed settlement and a fairness hearing\ncan be scheduled.  Only after class members and others have had an opportunity to receive notice\nand present supporting or opposing evidence at a formal fairness hearing will the Court be called\nupon to render a final judgment regarding the fairness of the proposed settlement.\nOnce the Court has ruled on the motion for preliminary approval, the deadlines for providing\nnotice, opting out of the Settlement Class, and submitting claims will begin to run.  The schedule\nset forth below, which is subject to the timing of actions to be taken by the parties and the Court in\nthis case, provides the Court with an approximate time line of the various steps in the settlement\napproval process under the Settlement Agreement.\nNotice Date: not later than 30 days after Preliminary Settlement Approval date\nDeadline for filing Objections: 90 days after Notice Date\nDeadline for filing an Opt-out notice: 90 days after Notice Date\nDeadline for filing a Claim: 120 days after Notice Date \nFinal Fairness Hearing: As determined by the Court.\n4\n\nIV. ARGUMENT\nA.  THE CERTIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT CLASS UNDER FED.\nR. CIV. P. 23 IS APPROPRIATE \nThe benefits of the proposed Settlement can be realized only through the certification of a\nsettlement class.  The Supreme Court of the United States has emphatically confirmed the viability\nof such settlement classes.  See Amchem Prods. Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 (1997).  So, too, have\nthe federal appeals courts.  See e.g., In re Prudential Ins. Co. Of Am. Sales Practices Litig., 148 F.3d\n283 (3d Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 890 (1999) (“Prudential II”);  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp.,\n150 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir. 1998).  The use of such settlement classes, where the parties have engaged\nin and concluded settlement negotiations prior to class certification and notice, has been clearly\napproved by this Circuit, Weinberger v. Kendrick, 698 F.2d 61 (2d Cir. 1982), cert denied, 464 U.S.\n818, 78 L.Ed.2d 89, 104 S.Ct. 77 (1983), so long as “district judges who decide to employ such a\nprocedure... scrutinize the fairness of the settlement with even more than the usual care.”  Id., at 73.\nSee also In re Prudential Securities Inc., 163 F.R.D. 200, 205 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (“tentative or\ntemporary settlement classes are favored when there is little likelihood of abuse, and the settlement\nis fair and reasonable and under the scrutiny of the trial judge,”) (quoting In re Beef Indust. Antitrust\nLit. 607 F.2d 167, 174 (5th Cir. 1979), cert denied, 452 U.S. 905, 101 S.Ct. 3029, 69 L.Ed.2d 405\n(1981)).   \nThe proposed Settlement in this case readily meets the Rule 23(a) criteria of numerosity,\ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy.  Certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate for\nsettlement of the class members’ compensatory damages claims because all plaintiff’s claims for\ncompensatory relief are premised on the predominating common issues of the existence of a blanket\nstrip search policy at the SCJ, and whether the County of Schenectady was responsible for that\n5\n\npolicy.  There is no danger that individual variations in the type or magnitude of damage suffered\nby individual class members will affect predominance, as the class representative as the same type\nof damages and seeks the same type of relief as the members of the proposed class.  Moreover,\nresolution of this litigation by a class settlement is superior to individual adjudication of the class\nmembers’ claims for compensatory relief.  In particular, the proposed settlement provides the class\nmembers with an ability to obtain predictable, certain and defined compensatory relief promptly,\nand it contains well defined administrative procedures to assure due process of law to each\nindividual class member, including the right to “opt out” of the settlement agreement.  By contrast,\nindividual litigation carries with it great uncertainty and costs, and is doubtful that many of the\nproposed class members would be able to vindicate their rights in an individual action, because of\nthe risk of a minimal damage award and the costs of pursuing an individual case.  A class-wide\nsettlement would also relieve the judicial burden that would result from the repeated adjudication\nof the same issues in thousands of individual damages trials against Schenectady County.  Indeed,\nfor all of the above reasons, numerous other district courts have certified such class actions where\nthe allegations were the same as in this case.  See, e.g., Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227\nF.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y. 2005); Bynum v. District of Columbia, 214 F.R.D. 27 (D.D.C. 2003); Maneely\nv. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y 2002); Mack v. Suffolk Cty. 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass.\n2000); Kahler v. County of Rensselaer, 03 CV 1324 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2004).  \n1.  The Elements of Rule 23(a) are Satisfied in the Present Case\nApproval of the settlement class, at lease for purposes of notice, is appropriate, since the\nPlaintiffs can establish each of the four threshold requirements of Subsection (a) of the Rule, which\nprovides:\nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on\n6\n\nbehalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the\nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses\nof the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  See, e.g., Prudential, supra.  Here, all four elements easily are satisfied.  \na.  The Class Members are Sufficiently Numerous\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the proponent of a class action demonstrate that \"the class is so\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\"  This rule does not impose a burden of\ndemonstrating that joinder of all class members is \"impossible.\"  Robideaux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931,\n935 (2d Cir. 1993) (“[i]mpracticable does not mean impossible”), see also Boggs v. Divested Atomic\nCorp., 141 F.R.D. 58, 63 (S.D. Ohio 1991) (“satisfaction of the numerosity requirement does not\nrequire that joinder is impossible, but only that plaintiff will suffer a strong litigational hardship or\ninconvenience if joinder is required.”) There is no fixed minimum number of class members that\nwill satisfy this requirement, but “[a] leading treatise concludes, based on an examination of\nprevailing precedent, that the difficulty in joining as few as 40 class members should raise a\npresumption that joinder is impracticable.”  Robideaux, at 937 (citing 1 Herbert B. Newberg,\nNewberg on Class Actions: A Manual for Group Litigation at Federal and State Levels, § 3.05, at\n141-42).  \nIn the present case, Defendants produced in the course of discovery documents detailing that\nduring the proposed class period, approximately 5,500 non-felony detainees were booked into the\nSCJ.  (Exhibit 2 to Rozger affirmation).  Moreover, the proposed class here is likely to be chiefly\ncomprised of economically and socially marginalized persons whose access to legal counsel and the\ncourt system is extremely limited.  For these reasons, it is clear that joinder is impracticable, and it\n7\n\nis clear that the proposed class meets the numerosity requirement.   \nb.  The Class Members Share Common Questions of Law and Fact\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the class.”  The\n“commonality requirement is met if plaintiffs’ grievances share a common question of law or of\nfact.”  Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 376 (2d Cir. 1997).  “Rule 23 does not require that all\nquestions of law or fact be common, it only requires that the common questions predominate over\nthe individual questions.”  Dura-Built Corp. v. Chase Manhattan Corp., 89 F.R.D. 87, 93\n(S.D.N.Y.1981)   Plaintiffs are not required to show that all class members claims are identical to\neach other, and any differences between the proposed class members, “while arguably relevant as\ndefenses to liability, do not change the fact that this class action raises the same basic claim and\nshares common questions of law.”  Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 23 (D.Mass. 2000)\n(allowing certification of strip search class action despite “varying defenses to liability which may\nbe raised regarding particular individuals”).  Indeed, a single common question is sufficient to\nsatisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).  In re Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation, 818 F.2d\n145 (2d Cir. 1987).  Plaintiffs are entitled to class certification where the class claims arise “from\na common nucleus of operative fact regardless of whether the underlying facts fluctuate over the\nclass period and vary as to individual claimants,” Haywood v. Barnes, 109 F.R.D. 568, 577\n(E.D.N.C. 1986).   \nHere, Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirement of commonality.  They claim that they were\nillegally strip searched at the Schenectady County Jail pursuant to the Defendants’ practice of strip-\nsearching all individuals booked into the SCJ.  Defendants deny such a practice, and maintain that\nall strip searches were conducted on a finding of reasonable suspicion.  As such, this class action\nhas two common issues that are of central importance to the claims of all class members: whether\n8\n\nthe Schenectady County Jail employed a blanket strip search policy and/or practice during the class\nperiod, and whether Defendants Schenectady County are responsible for such Constitutional\nviolations.  These questions are the centerpiece of this litigation, and would be the focus of any trial\nin this matter.  They have been the subject of extensive discovery already, and has, Plaintiffs\ncontend, been confirmed by the 30(b)(6) deposition of Defendant County of Schenectady and the\nSchenectady County Jail’s written policies.  Class certification here is appropriate given these\nquestions, even if there are some variations in circumstances amongst individual class members.\nSee  Eddleman v. Jefferson Co., Kentucky, 96 F.3d 1448 (Table), 1996 WL 495013, *4 1996 U.S.\nApp. LEXIS 25298 (6th Cir. 1996) (commonality is present even where some class members “subject\nto a full strip search instead of a partial one, or the fact that some individuals may fail to meet the\nqualifications for the class because it can be shown that there was reasonable suspicion to search\nthem  …  These  isolated  instances  of  non-commonality  are  not  grounds  for  denying  class\ncertification”) (Exhibit 3).  \nc. The Plaintiff’s Claims are Typical of the Class\nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the claims of the class representatives be \"typical of the claims\n. . . . of the class.\"  The requirement of this subdivision of the rule, along with the adequacy of\nrepresentation requirement set forth in subsection (a)(4), is designed to assure that the interests of\nunnamed class members will be protected adequately by the named class representative.  See, e.g.,\nGeneral Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed. 2d 740\n(1982). The measure of whether a plaintiff's claims are typical is whether the nature of the plaintiff's\nclaims, judged from both a factual and a legal perspective, are such that in litigating his or her\npersonal claims he or she reasonably can be expected to advance the interests of absent class\nmembers. Id.  Common questions must predominate over individual questions.  The Court must find\n9\n\nthat \"the group for which certification is sought seeks to remedy a common legal grievance.\"\nHochschuler v. G.D. Searle & Co., 82 F.R.D. 339 (N.D. Ill. 1978).  Rule 23(b)(3) does not require\nthat all questions of law or fact be common.  “Thus, when common questions represent a significant\naspect of the case and they can be resolved for all members of the class in a single adjudication,\nthere is a clear justification for handling the dispute on a representative rather than on an individual\nbasis.”  In re “Agent Orange” Product Liability Litigation, 100 F.R.D. 718, 723 (2nd Cir. 1983)\n(quoting 7A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1777 (1972)).  \nHere, Plaintiff raises common issues of fact and law that predominate over any individual\nissues that might arise. All of the proposed class members’ legal claims revolve around one legal\nissue: is a policy of strip searching every pretrial detainee admitted to a county jail, without regard\nto the crime charged or circumstances of arrest, constitutional?  Plaintiffs’ claims also share a\ncommon factual issue - did such a practice  exist, and was the defendant County responsible?  These\nlegal and factual issues predominate over any of the Plaintiffs’ individual issues. \nd. The Plaintiff and Her Counsel Will Fairly and Adequately Represent the Class\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the class representative “fairly and adequately protect the class.”\nIn this judicial circuit, “gauging the adequacy of representation requires an assessment whether the\nclass representatives have interests antagonistic to those of the class they seek to represent, as well\nas an evaluation of the capabilities and qualifications of the class representative’s counsel.”  Dietrich\nv. Bauer, 192 F.R.D. 119, 126 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).  Both prerequisites of adequacy of representation\nare met in this case.  \nPlaintiff and the proposed class members have a uniform interest in ending illegal strip\nsearches at the SCJ, and to obtaining appropriate compensation from Defendants.  In nearly identical\ncircumstances, and given the common legal and factual issues, courts have deemed plaintiffs in\n10\n\nsimilar cases to be adequate class representatives. See, e.g., Kahler, supra; Marriot, supra;\nEddleman, supra;  Smith v. Montgomery Co., 573 F.Supp. 604 (D. Md. 1983) appeal dism., 740 F.2d\n963 (4th Cir. 1984).\nThe class is also represented by competent counsel who are have extensive experience in\nboth class action and civil rights litigation, including several other strip search class actions in this\nDistrict.  See Marriott, 228 F.R.D. 133, 172 (N.D.N.Y. 2005); Kahler, supra; Kelsey v. County of\nSchoharie, 04 CV 0299.  The firm resumes for each class counsel also attest to their experience and\nability to represent the class.  See exhibits 4-7 to Rozger affirmation.  In short, the Plaintiffs are\nadequate representatives, and have retained experienced class counsel that have aggressively\nlitigated this action.  They have satisfied this requirement for certification.\n2.  The Elements of Rule 23(b)(3) Are Also Satisfied\na.  Common Questions of Law and Fact Predominate \nA class action may be maintained under Rule 23 (b)(3) if “questions of law or fact common\nto the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and\nthat a class action is superior to other methods for the fair end efficient adjudication of the\ncontroversy.”  Id. “The Rule 23 predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently\ncohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”  Amchem Prod. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623\n(1997).  In order to meet the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(2), a plaintiff must establish\nthat “the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof, and thus applicable to the\nclass as a whole, … predominate over those issues that are subject to only individualized proof.”\nVisa Check, 280 F.3d 136 (citation omitted).  The most pragmatic way for the Court to make this\ndetermination is to evaluate whether “common proof will predominate at trial.”  In Re NASDAQ\nMarket Makers, 169 F.R.D. 473, 517 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).  See also, Jenkins v. Raymark Indus., 782\n11\n\nF.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir. 1986) (the “significant aspect” requirement is met if “jury findings on the\nclass questions … will … significantly advance the resolution of the underlying … cases”); Dietrich,\n192 F.R.D. at 127 (in determining whether common issues of fact predominate, “a court’s inquiry\nis directed primarily toward whether the issue of liability is common to members of the class”). \nHere, all of the Plaintiff’s legal claims revolve around one legal issue: is a policy of strip\nsearching every pretrial detainee admitted to a county jail, without regard to the crime charged or\ncircumstances of arrest, constitutional?  Plaintiff’s claims also share a common factual issue - did\nsuch a practice  exist, and was the defendant County responsible?  These issues, and not any of the\nPlaintiff’s individual issues, were the subject of the long and contentious discovery process in this\ncase, and surely would have been the subject of equally contentious motion practice had the case\nnot resolved.  These legal and factual issues accordingly predominate over all of the class members’\nindividual issues.  \nb.  A Class Action is the Superior Method of Adjudicating This Case \nFinally, Rule 23(b)(3) requires that a class action suit provide the best way of managing and\nadjudicating the claims at issue.  In this case, settlement on a class basis also is superior to individual\nlitigation and adjudication because settlement provides class members with prompt compensation\nfor their damages, whether those damages exist now or manifest themselves sometime in the future.\nBy contrast, compensation resulting from litigation is highly uncertain and may not be received\nbefore lengthy trial and appellate proceedings are complete.  In addition, the Settlement obviously\nremoves the overwhelming and redundant costs of individual trials.  \nAccordingly, the Settlement Agreement renders a class action superior to other potential\navenues of recovery for Plaintiffs and the Class.  Therefore, this case presents the paradigmatic\nexample of a dispute which can be resolved to effectuate the fundamental goals of Rule 23: (1) to\n12\n\npromote judicial economy through the efficient resolution of multiple claims in a single action; and\n(2) to provide persons with smaller claims, who might otherwise be economically precluded from\ndoing so, the opportunity to assert their rights.  Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice &\nProcedure: Civil 2d § 1754.  At the same time, the Settlement fully preserves the due process rights\nof each individual plaintiff seeking compensatory damages. In sum, the requirements of Rule\n23(b)(3) are satisfied and certification of a the proposed class is appropriate.\nB. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SHOULD BE GRANTED PRELIMINARILY\nAPPROVAL BY THE COURT \n                  \nAt this stage, the Court is charged with determining whether the proposed Class Settlement\nis possibly fair, reasonable and adequate.  The Court’s function is “to ascertain whether there is any\nreason to notify the class members of the proposed settlement and to proceed with a fairness\nhearing.”  Prudential, 163 F.R.D. at 209 (quoting Amstrong v. Board of School Directors of the City\nof Milwaukee, 616 F.2d 305, 314 (7th Cir. 1980)).   The procedure of providing notice to the class\nfollowed by a hearing to consider approving a class settlement has been accepted by numerous\ncourts and is now standard practice.  Prudential, supra; see also Bronson v. Board of Education of\nthe City School District of the City of Cincinnati, 604 F. Supp 68 (S.D. Ohio 1984).2\nThe  Manual  for  Complex  Litigation,  Third  (Federal  Judicial  Center  1995)  §30.41,\nsummarizes the recommended procedure that courts have articulated for the class action settlement\napproval process:\nA two step process is followed when considering class settlements.\nFirst, that court makes a preliminary evaluation of the fairness of the\n2The Court in Bronson outlined the following procedure for preliminary approval of a settlement.  “The\ncourt must preliminary approve the proposed settlement; then, members of the class must be given notice of the\nproposed settlement and after a hearing, the court must decide whether the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable\nand adequate.” Id. at 71.\n13\n\nsettlement…If the proposed settlement appears to be the product of\nserious,  informed,  non-collusive  negotiations,  has  no  obvious\ndeficiencies, does not improperly grant preferential treatment to class\nrepresentatives or segments of the class, and falls within the range of\npossible approval, then the court should direct that notice be given to\nthe class members of a formal fairness hearing, at which evidence\nmay be presented in support of and in opposition to the settlement.\nAuthorizations to disseminate notice reflects a recognition by the Court that the settlement\nis in the range of possible approval; the ultimate Rule 23(e) determination is reserved pending the\ncompletion of the notice and initial opt-out process, so the Court can consider input from the class\nmembers who will be bound by the final approval Order.  See In re Baldwin-United Corporation,\n105 F.R.D. 475, 485 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (court authorized provisional class certification and notice\n“without prejudice to the findings the Court will make after conducting the fairness hearing, at\nwhich time all objections or arguments in opposition to the proposed settlements will be heard and\nconsidered and proponents must discharge their burden to prove that the proposed settlement\nagreements are fair and reasonable”); see also In re NASDAQ Market Makers Antitrust Litigation,\n1997 U.S. District LEXIS 20835, 94 Civ. 3996 (S.D.N.Y. December 31, 1997) (exhibit 8); In re\nGeneral Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig.,  55 F.3d 768 (3d Cir. 1995);\nIn re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, 643 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1981); Armstrong v. Board\nof School Directors of the City of Milwaukee, 616 F.2d 305 (7th Cir. 1980).\nWhether the settlement falls within the range of possible approval under Rule 23 turns upon\nwhether there is a conceivable basis for presuming that the more rigorous standard applied for final\napproval will be satisfied.  The standard for final approval of a settlement consists of showing that\nthe settlement is “fair, reasonable and adequate,” Weinberger, 698 F.2d at 73, considering “the\ncomplexity of the litigation, comparison of the proposed settlement with the likely result of\nlitigation, experience of class counsel, scope of discovery preceding settlement, and the ability of\n14\n\nthe defendant to satisfy a greater judgement,” In re: Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc., 960 F.2d\n285, 293 (2d Cir. 1992).  In the absence of fraud, collusion or the like, the Court should not\nsubstitute its own judgment for that of counsel.  Weinberger, supra; see also Trief v. Dun &\nBradstreet Corp., 840 F. Supp. 277, 281 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (\"absent evidence of fraud or overreaching\n[courts] consistently have refused to act as Monday morning quarterbacks in evaluating the\njudgment of counsel\"); In re Warner Communications Sec. Lit., 798 F.2d 35, 37 (2d Cir. 1986) (“it\nis not a district judge's job to dictate the terms of a class settlement\"); M. Berenson Co. v. Faneuil\nHall Market Place, Inc., 671 F. Supp. 819, 822 (D. Mass 1987) (\"[w]here, as here, a proposed\nsettlement has been reached after meaningful discovery, after arm’s length negotiation, conducted\nby capable counsel, it is presumptively fair.\")  Preliminary approval is not a definitive final finding\non the fairness of the proposed settlement, and permitting notice to members of the class does not\nmean that the Court has found the settlement to be fair, reasonable, and adequate for purposes of\nfinal approval.  See Holden v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 655 F.Supp. 1398 (D.Minn. 1987).  \nAn initial analysis of the terms and features of the proposed class settlement of this case\nshould give the Court confidence that it merits serious consideration by the class members, and that\nit will likely serve as the fair and comprehensive resolution of class members’ claims. Preliminary\napproval requires a finding that the Settlement falls within the range of possible approval, meaning,\nprimarily, that Settlement was reached as a result of arms-length negotiations and after sufficient\ndiscovery was conducted.  Here, both those requirements are satisfied.  Settlement negotiations,\nwhich included Class counsel, were extensive, adversarial, and were carried on for over a year -\nstarting just before Magistrate Treece’s May 17, 2005 settlement conference and continuing up until\nthe agreement was executed by both parties on July 31, 2006.  These negotiations were conducted\nby experienced and knowledgeable counsel, who had the benefit of extensive fact discovery from\n15\n\nboth Plaintiffs and Defendants. Moreover, the Settlement was achieved only after over two years\nof intense adversarial litigation, with counsel for the Plaintiffs vigorously pursuing fact discovery\nand often obtaining the intervention of Magistrate Treece.  The settlement was reached after\nextensive discovery revealed evidence which, Plaintiffs believe, would fully support the granting\nof preliminary injunction and class certification.  Thus, the settlement was reached in a procedurally\nfair, arms-length manner.  \n It is also clear that the settlement is substantively fair.  First of all, the settlement provides\nsubstantial injunctive relief to the class, in that the Defendants have agreed to implement a revised\nstrip search policy at the SCJ that provides that such searches will only occur upon reasonable\nsuspicion that the detainee is secreting contraband, and to train their correction officers about that\nrevised policy.  (Exhibit 1, p. 10-11).  This will help insure that any class member who should enter\nthe SCJ again will not have their Constitutional rights violated by an unlawful strip search.  \nIn addition, it is clear that the monetary compensation to the class members here for the\nindignity of an unlawful strip search is fair and reasonable, given the inherent risks of litigation and\ngiven awards in similar cases.  Since each class member who files a claim will receive a pro rata\nshare of the settlement proceeds, what each claimant receives will depend on how many class\nmembers make claims.  In similar strip search class action settlements, both in this District and\nnationwide, class members have filed claims at rates between 11 and 32%.  See Doan v. Watson,\n2002 WL 31730917, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23333, No. 99-4-C-B/S (S.D.Ind. December 4, 2002)\n(619 of 2591 class members made claims, or 24%) (exhibit 9); Eddleman v. Jefferson  County, 3:91\nCV 144-J (W.D.KY.) (approximately 24% of class made claims) (exhibit 10); McBean v. City of\nNew York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 381-82 (S.D.N.Y 2006) (4319 of 40,352 class members filed claims, or\n11%); Kahler v. County of Rensselaer, 03CV1324 (32% of class members filed claims) (Rozger\n16\n\naffidavit, ¶ 11).  If this case achieves the same 32% claims rate as in the Kahler case, approximately\n1,760 individuals will share the $1,750,000 of the settlement allocated to paying claims, or about\n$994 each.  If the rate of return is closer to the 24% rate achieved in the Eddleman or Doan cases,\neach class member filing a claim will receive approximately $1,326.  Of course, it is not necessary\nat this time for the Court to determine what the ultimate claims rate in this case will be; all that is\nrequired is to determine whether the proposed settlement is fair enough to warrant going forward\nand notifying the proposed class.  Since it is likely that class members here will receive at least\n$1,000 each, the proposed settlement is well within the range of fairness required to tentatively\ncertify the class and send the class notice. \nIndeed, numerous courts have approved, on motions for final approval, strip search class\nsettlements for per-claimant amounts of the same or less than what is likely here. In the case of\nTyson, et. al.  v. City of New York, et. al., 97 Civ. 3762 (S.D.N.Y.), a class action filed to address\na blanket strip search policy in New York City jails, settling class members who did no more than\nfile a claim (which is all class members are asked to do here) received a $250 payment.  See\nMcBean, supra at 389.  In McBean, the court approved a strip search class settlement providing\npayments of approximately $825 per person.  (Id.)  In addition, claimants in  Doan v. Watson, supra,\nreceived payments of $1,000, as did the claimants in Kahler.  \nFinally, in the case of Dodge v. County of Orange, 02 CV 769 (CM) (MDF) (S.D.N.Y.), the\nparties reached a strip search class settlement that provided for far less monetary relief, with more\nonerous prerequisites for class members receiving such relief, than what the class would receive in\nthis case.  In Dodge, the class, which consisted of up to 19,280 individuals (Dodge v. County of\nOrange, 226 F.R.D. 177, 180 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)) shared a total of $624,800, (exhibit 11 to Rozger\n17\n\naffirmation, p. 13)3, subject to the defendants’ right to exclude class members from receiving a\npayment if such class members were alleged gang members; had ever been charged with escape;\nwere the subject of a drugs or weapons charge; displayed “assaultive or dangerous” behavior; had\na “prior or current contraband charge;” had activated the metal detector and were found to have\ncontraband; or were charged with a violation of probation or parole.  (Id., p. 5-6).  Each class\nmember charged with a misdemeanor, or less, would receive a maximum of $1,000 (id., p. 9), and\nthat any remaining money in the fund would revert back to the defendants (id., p. 14).  That\nsettlement was approved by the court.  (Exhibit 12 to Rozger affirmation, docket entry # 112).\nHere, the proposed class settlement gives class members the benefit of a significant amount\nof compensation without having to prove particular emotional distress or the particular circum-\nstances of their search, and without the added obstacle of allowing Defendants a chance to disallow\ntheir claims.  In addition, class members share in the entire portion of the settlement fund devoted\nto claims, without the prospect of any excess amount being returned to the Defendants at the close\nof the process.  This simple structure allows for more of the settlement amount to be paid as claims,\nrather than taken up by administrative costs, and greatly reduces the incentive for the parties to\nengage in post-settlement litigation.   Thus, all in all, the amount offered to class members pursuant\nto the settlement here is fair, and on par with other settlements in similar cases.  Accordingly, at this\nstage of preliminary approval, there is clear evidence that the Settlement is within the range of\npossible approval and thus should be preliminarily approved. \nC. THE COURT SHOULD DIRECT NOTICE TO THE CLASS\nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), class members are entitled to notice of any proposed settlement\n3For their efforts, class counsel in Dodge received $600,000 in counsel fees pursuant to the\nsettlement.  Id., p. 15.\n18\n\nbefore it is finally approved by the Court.  Manual for Complex Litigation Third (1995) §30.212.\nThe Settlement Agreement proposes notice of the Settlement be provided to all class members and\na mailing to the known address, as determined by the Schenectady County Jail’s booking sheets\nand/or the records of the Schenectady County Department of Probation and the Department of Social\nServices.  The settlement administrator will also make a follow-up mailing for any notice that is\nreturned by utilizing national address and credit databases, and by publication in local newspapers.\nUnder Rule 23(e) and Constitutional notions of due process, adequate notice must be given\nto all potential class members to enable them to make an intelligent choice as to whether to opt-out\nof the class.  The Supreme Court has held that Rule 23 and due process do not require delivery of\nactual notice to every class member.  Rather \"notice reasonably certain to reach most of those\ninterested in objecting is likely to safeguard the interests of all.\" Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts,\n472 U.S. 797, 812, 105 S.Ct. 2965, 86 L.Ed.2d 628 (1985).  In addition, “[i]t is well-settled that in\nthe usual situation first class mail and publication fully satisfy the notice requirements of Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23 and the due process clause.”  Zimmer Paper Products Inc. v. Berger & Montague, P.C.,\n758 F.2d 86, 90 (3rd Cir. 1985); see also Cayuga Indian Nation v. Carey, 89 F.R.D. 627, 633\n(N.D.N.Y. 1981) (“individual notice by first class mail, coupled with notice by publication satisfies\nthe requirements of due process and Rule 23.”) In this case, counsel for the Settlement Class has a\nlast known address and date of birth, obtained from the Jail’s booking sheets, for each Settlement\nClass member.  If the mailing to the last known address is returned, the personal information on each\nclass member will be used to obtain a new address, and another mailing will be sent.  In addition,\nclass counsel will also obtain corrected class member addresses from other Schenectady County\ndatabases.  (Exhibit 1, p. 13-14).  This procedure, combined with publication, fully satisfies the\nrequirements of due process and Rule 23, and should be approved by the Court.\n19\n\nD.  A FINAL FAIRNESS HEARING SHOULD BE SCHEDULED\nThe Court should schedule a final fairness hearing to obtain all required information to\ndetermine that class certification is proper and the settlement should be approved.  See Manual for\nComplex Litigation, Third §30.44 (1995).  The fairness hearing will provide a forum for proponents\nand opponents to explain, describe or challenge the terms and conditions of the class certification\nand settlement, including the fairness, adequacy and reasonableness of the settlement.  Accordingly,\nplaintiffs request that the Court schedule the time, date, and place of the final fairness hearing.\nV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order: (1)\nconditionally certifying a class action with respect to the claims against Defendants pursuant to Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) for the purpose of effectuating a class action settlement of Plaintiff’s strip search\nclaims; (2) preliminarily approving a class settlement with Defendants; (3) directing notice to class\nmembers regarding the proposed Class Settlement; (4) scheduling a final approval hearing, and (5)\nentering the proposed Order for Preliminary Approval.\nDated: August 18, 2006\nRespectfully submitted,\nBeranbaum Menken Ben-Asher & Bierman LLP\nBy: __________/s/_____________________\nJason J.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n----------------------------------------------------------X\nNICHOLE MARIE McDANIEL, and\nLESSIE LEE DAVIES,\nboth individually and on behalf of a class of others\nsimilarly situated, \n-against-\n04-CV-0757(GLS)(RFT)\nCOUNTY OF SCHENECTADY,\nHARRY BUFFARDI, both individually and in \nHis official capacity as Sheriff of the County of\nSchenectady, GORDON POLLARD, both\nIndividually and as Undersheriff of the\nCounty of Schenectady, and ROBERT\nELWELL, both individually and as Major\nIn the Schenectady County Sheriff’s Department,\nDefendants.\n-----------------------------------------------------------X\nDecision and Order\nI.  Introduction\nPending before the court is the final approval of a class action\nSettlement Agreement.  On September 5, 2007, this court conducted a final\nfairness hearing to determine whether the proposed Settlement Agreement\nbetween the parties was fair, reasonable and adequate, and to address\nClass Counsel’s application for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.  The\ntranscript of that hearing along with this Decision and Order constitutes the \n1\n\nfull decision of this court.  \nFor the reasons that follow, this court approves the settlement\nagreement in all respects except as to attorneys’ fees.  The court will only\npermit attorneys’ fees for the time spent by the attorneys for the class at\nthe hourly rates traditionally charged in their native jurisdiction. \nPreviously, the court reserved on whether it would authorize payment\nof attorneys’ fees to prosecute an appeal.  Because it refused to add a\n“factor” authorizing a fee award beyond the actual hours expended, the\ncourt also stated that counsel would be, compensated for work already\nperformed, and to be performed, which was not reflected in the previously\nsubmitted fee documentation (i.e. work for the Final fairness hearing\nthrough the filing of the proposed order).  In light of oral argument and the\nproposed order submitted, the court now modifies it previous statement for\nsake of clarity.  Subject to court approval upon submission of accurate\nbilling records, the court authorizes additional compensation to class\ncounsel for work done from the final fairness hearing through the\nsubmission of the proposed order.  See Dkt. No. 141.  The court will not\nauthorize counsel fees to prosecute an appeal, or otherwise provide any\nfuture compensation beyond the time expended through the preparation of\n2\n\nthe proposed order currently before the court.  See Dkt. No. 141.  Class\ncounsel is to submit, within SEVEN days of this order, the amount of\nattorneys’ fees for the time expended for the final fairness hearing through\nthe preparation of the proposed order currently before the court.    \nII.  Discussion   \nThe court, having read and considered the Settlement Agreement,\nthe Notice Plan, and Memoranda of Law submitted by Class Counsel,\nhaving reviewed the Defendants’ response and opposition regarding\nattorneys’ fees, having received evidence at the hearing, having heard\narguments from Class Counsel and the Defendants, and having considered\nthe submissions by Class members, now rules as follows:\nFINDINGS OF FACT\ni. This action was commenced on June 29, 2004, as a class\naction.\nii. After many months of intensive litigation, including extensive\ndiscovery and motion practice before this court, and as a result of\nintensive, arm’s length negotiations between Class Counsel and\nDefendants, including a daylong settlement conference before Magistrate\nJudge Randolph F. Treece on May 17, 2005, the parties have reached\n3\n\naccord with respect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to\nSettlement Class Members, in return for a release and dismissal of the\nclaims at issue in this case against the Defendants (\"Settlement \nAgreement\").  The resulting Settlement Agreement was preliminarily\napproved by the court on November 29, 2006.\niii. As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this\ncourt approved a proposed Notice Plan and Class Notice, which provided\nSettlement Class Members notice of the proposed settlement.  The Notice\nPlan provided an opportunity for class members to file objections to the\nSettlement.\niv. As of the deadline for the filing of objections, only one\nobjection was filed.  This objection, filed by an individual incarcerated in\nstate prison, failed to detail any basis for the objection.  Given the size of\nthis Settlement, and the notice plan described above, this court finds that\nthe comparatively low number of objections is indicative of the fairness,\nreasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement with the Defendants.\nv. Class Counsel has filed with the court affidavits from\nJoAnn Graff, Rust Consulting, and Dong He Chang, I Partners Inc.,\ndeclaring that the mailing of the court-approved notice and the\n4\n\nmaintenance of the settlement website, consistent with the Notice Plan,\nhas been completed.  Class Counsel has also filed an affidavit reflecting\nthe notice efforts undertaken by them.\nvi. The court finds that the published notice, mailed notice,\nInternet posting and other notices constitute the best practicable notice of\nthe Fairness Hearing, the proposed Settlement, Class Counsel’s\napplication for fees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class\nNotice and the Short Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid,\ndue and sufficient notice to all members of the Settlement Class, and\ncomplied fully with the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, the Constitution of the United States, the laws of New York and\nany other applicable law.  \nvii. Any persons who wished to be excluded from this Action\nwere provided an opportunity to “opt out” pursuant to the Notice.  All\npersons who have validly excluded themselves from this Action have no\nrights under the Settlement Agreement and shall not be bound by the\nSettlement Agreement or the final judgment herein.  The individuals who\nproperly excluded themselves from the Settlement are Frederick Longo\nand Josephine Hancock.\n5\n\nviii. Settlement Class Members are bound by the Settlement,\nthe Settlement Agreement and releases contained therein, and the Final\nOrder and Judgment, and do not have any further opportunity to opt-out of\nthe Action.\nix. Any class member who did not timely file and serve an\nobjection in writing to the Settlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order\nand Judgment, or to Plaintiffs’ Class Counsel’s application for fees, costs,\nand expenses, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Class\nNotice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of\nSettlement, is deemed to have waived any such objection by appeal,\ncollateral attack, or otherwise.\nx. On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the\nprovisions of the Settlement Agreement, the court is of the opinion that the\nSettlement is a fair, reasonable and  adequate compromise of the claims\nagainst the Defendants in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the court\nhas considered in affirming this Settlement, including:\na. The liability issues in this case have been vigorously\ncontested. \n6\n\nb. The court notes that for settlement purposes, this\nSettlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class Members now,\nwithout further litigation, under circumstances where the liability issues are\nstill vigorously contested among the parties to this litigation and among the\nparties to the individual litigation.  This Settlement provides Class Members\nwith a substantial monetary benefit.\nc. This Settlement is clearly a byproduct of hard-fought\nlitigation between the parties, and not a result of any collusion on the part\nof Class Counsel or Counsel for the Defendants.\nxi. Class Counsel submitted to the court and served on the\nDefendants their application for reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and\nexpenses consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  \nThe court declines to provide a multiplier and/or the percentage\nmethod on these fees, for reasons detailed in the court’s bench decision of\nSeptember 5, 2007, the transcript of which is incorporated by reference\nherein.  \nInstead attorneys’ fees in the amount of $343,744.50, which\nrepresents the time spent by the attorneys for the class at the hourly rates\ntraditionally charged in their native jurisdictions is awarded.  The court also\n7\n\nawards Class Counsel’s request for reimbursement of pre-settlement\nlitigation expenses in the amount of $10,053.31.1 \nxii.       The court grants Class Counsel’s request for the\nreimbursement of expenses relative to the administration of the settlement\nin the amount of $84,233.40.  The court also grants Class Counsel’s \nrequest to pay the Settlement Administrator  $23,000 for future\nadministrative expenses, for a total of $ 107,233.40.  In the event that the\ncosts of future administration are larger than this estimate, the court will\nentertain an application to have those sums deducted from the amounts\nheld in escrow pending the completion of any appeals.  \nxiii.      Class Counsel has stated their intention to appeal the\ncourt’s ruling on attorneys’ fees.  Pursuant to the Section III(F)(1) of the\nSettlement Agreement, the proceeds of the settlement may be distributed\nimmediately, consistent with this order, while the sum of $ 296,202.19 (the\ndisputed amount of attorneys’ fees) will be held in escrow by the\nSettlement Administrator.  This amount will be deposited into an insured\ninterest bearing escrow account entitled the “SCJ Settlement Attorneys’\nFees Escrow Account,” which will be maintained by the Settlement\n1 The amounts stated for attorneys’ fees and expenses, based on the proffered time records of\nclass counsel, are reflected in Docket Entries 127 & 128.  \n8\n\nAdministrator, Rust Consulting.  No attorney in this proceeding will have\nsignature authority on this account.  One of the conditions of this account\nwill be that no funds are allowed to be withdrawn from the account absent\nan order of the court.  The Settlement Administrator will maintain the bank\nrecords for this account, and provide them to any party or the court on two\nbusiness days notice.  \nxiv.    The court will not authorize counsel fees to prosecute an\nappeal, or otherwise provide any future compensation beyond the time\nexpended through the preparation of the proposed order currently before\nthe court, see Dkt. No. 141, subject to court approval after submission of\naccurate billing records within SEVEN DAYS of this order.      \nxv.    Should the court’s decision be affirmed, all monies\nremaining in the “SCJ Settlement Attorneys’ Fees Escrow Account,” with\naccumulated interest, after deducting amounts allowed to be withdrawn\npursuant to the Orders of this court, will be distributed to the claimants on\nthe Settlement on a pro rata basis.\nxvi.       Class Counsel has provided the court with a list of 861\nindividuals who filed timely claims on the settlement.  The court orders that\nthe claims of these individuals be paid by the Settlement Administrator\n9\n\npursuant to the Settlement Agreement.  \nxvii.      Class Counsel has provided the court with the identities\nof thirty-five late claimants on the Settlement.  Leave of court his hereby\nprovided for the thirty-five individuals who filed late claims to participate in\nthe class action settlement and have their claims on the Settlement\nhonored in full.  \nxviii. The claims procedure established under the Settlement\nAgreement is fair, a simplified process, and workable.  In any event, the\ncourt will retain jurisdiction to work out any unanticipated problems.\nThis court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of\nthis proceeding.\nxix. Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, the following Settlement Class is certified for purposes of final\nsettlement:\nAll persons who were placed into the custody of the\nSchenectady County Jail during the period June 29,\n2001, through and including June 29, 2005, after\nbeing charged with misdemeanors, violations,\nviolations of probation or parole, or held on civil\nmatters, and claim that they were strip searched\nupon their entry into the Jail.  Specifically excluded\nfrom the class are Defendants and any and all of\ntheir respective affiliates, legal representatives,\nheirs, successors, employees or assignees.  \n10\n\nxx. The court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the\nrequirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are\nsatisfied, and that a Class Action is an appropriate method for resolving the\ndisputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for Class certification under\nRule 23 are present.  The Class members are ascertainable and too\nnumerous to be joined.  Questions of law and fact common to all Class\nmembers predominate over individual issues and should be determined in\none proceeding with respect to all Class members.  The Class\nRepresentatives’ claims are typical of those of the Class.  The Class action\nmechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating and resolving\nthis action.  \nxxi. The Settlement Class Representative, Lessie Davies, is\nentitled to and is hereby awarded a payment of $12,000.00, in recognition\nof the efforts she undertook in connection with this lawsuit.  William Davis,\nan individual who had planned to intervene in this action to assist class\ncounsel, is hereby awarded an incentive award of $1,500.00 in addition to\nhis pro rata share of the settlement fund.  Former Class Representative\nNichole McDaniel will receive no incentive award.  All class members who\n11\n\nhave made claims on the settlement are entitled to receive their pro rata\nshare of the settlement fund after administrative expenses, attorneys’ fees\nand expenses, incentive awards and the amounts to be placed in escrow\nunder Paragraph xiii of this Order are deducted from the fund.  \nxxii. The court grants final approval of the Settlement\nAgreement, as being fair, reasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nWHEREFORE IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT\nThe Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed Settlement is\nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part as follows:\n1. The Settlement Class Representative, Lessie Davies, is\nentitled to and is hereby awarded a payment of\n$12,000.00, in recognition of the efforts she undertook in\nconnection with this lawsuit. William Davis, an individual\nwho had planned to intervene in this action to assist class\ncounsel, is hereby awarded an incentive award of\n$1,500.00 in addition to his pro rata share of the\nsettlement fund.  Former Class Representative Nichole\nMcDaniel will receive no incentive award.  \n12\n\n2. All class members who have made claims on the\nsettlement are entitled to receive their pro rata share of\nthe settlement fund after administrative expenses,\nattorneys’ fees and expenses, incentive awards and the\namounts to be placed in escrow under Paragraph xiii of\nthis Order are deducted from the fund.  \n3. Class Counsel’s application for attorneys’ fees is granted\nin the amount of $343,744.50.  Class Counsel’s request\nfor reimbursement of pre-settlement litigation expenses is\ngranted in the amount of $10,053.31.  The sum of \n$296,202.19 (the disputed amount of attorneys’ fees) will\nbe held in escrow by the Settlement Administrator.  This\namount will be deposited into an insured interest bearing\nescrow account entitled the “SCJ Settlement Attorneys’\nFees Escrow Account,” which will be maintained by the\nSettlement Administrator, Rust Consulting.  No attorney in\nthis proceeding will have signature this account.  One of\nthe conditions of this account will be that no funds are\nallowed to be withdrawn from the account absent an\n13\n\norder of the court.  The Settlement Administrator will\nmaintain the bank records for this account, and provide\nthem to any party or the court on two business days\nnotice. \n4. Administration expenses and costs is granted in the\namount of $107,233.40.  In the event that costs of future\nadministration are larger than this estimate, the court will\nentertain an application to have those sums deducted\nfrom the amounts held in escrow pending the completion\nof any appeals. \n5. This Action and all claims against the Settling \ndefendants are dismissed with prejudice, but the court \nshall retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction of the \nAction, all Parties, and Settlement Class Members, to \ninterpret and enforce the terms, conditions and \nobligations of this Settlement Agreement.\n6. All Class members who have not timely filed an opt-out\nrequest are barred and enjoined from commencing and/or\nprosecuting any claim or action against the Defendants.\n14\n\nAny Class member who has not timely filed a request to\nexclude themselves shall be enjoined from initiating\nand/or proceeding as a class action in any forum.\n7.

Foley United States Courthouse \n445 Broadway \nAlbany, NY  12207 \nRe:  McDaniel u. County ofS  chenectady, No. 04-CV-757 (GLS/RFT) \nDear Judge Sharpe: \nI  am  lead  counsel  in  the  above-captioned  action.  Currently,  the  settlement \nadministrator has a limited number of unclaimed and/ or uncashed payments in the settlement \nescrow account.  Presently, approximately 270 class members have not received some or all of \ntheir settlement payment, and the total amount of these unclaimed funds is $  179, 163.77. \nGiven that the Court has ruled that the administrator cannot be compensated for additional \nefforts on behalf of the class after class counsel's unsuccessful appeal on attorneys' fees, the \nsettlement administrator has asked my  office  to take over this account and address any \nremaining payments to class members.  With permission from the Court, I plan to do so.  As \nthe Court is aware, many class members are currently expressing dissatisfaction with not \nbeing able to receive their supplemental settlement payments, and I  hope to address this \nproblem in short order. \nI have discussed this issue with the Defendants' counsel, William Greagan, and we have \nagreed on a  plan to address outstanding payments due to class members.  Class Counsel \nrequests leave of Court to have the settlement administrator close their bank account, and to \nhave  those  funds  deposited  in a  bank  account with  my  office  entitled the  \"SCJ  Escrow \nAccount.\"  This bank account will be handled in a manner identical to that provided under the \nRules of Professional Conduct for attorney escrow accounts.  My office will then endeavor to \nlocate and pay all remaining claimants.  The County will  provide my office with any new \nbooking information for class members admitted to the Schenectady County Jail after the flrSt \ndistribution following an initial effort by my office to locate these individuals.  The County's \nattorney, and the Court, will have access to information about the bank account, and I will \nprovide the Court with a report on December 1, 2011 regarding any funds remaining in the \naccount.  Attorney Greagan and I have not reached an agreement about how to address any \nunclaimed funds, but plan to discuss the matter later in the year.  Should the parties not be \nable to agree on this point, we will seek a conference with the Court in due course. \nI respectfully suggest that Your  Honor adopt this proposal, and I  have provided a \nproposed form order at the end of this letter.  Thank you for your consideration of this letter. \n\nCase 1:04-cv-00757-GLS-RFT   Document 213   Filed 05/05/11   Page 2 of 2\nThe Honorable Gary L. Sharpe \nApri118, 2011, Page 2 \nRe:  McDaniel v.

THIS ACCOUNT WILL BE \nHANDLED  IN  A  COMPARABLE  MANNER  TO  ATTORNEY  ESCROW  ACCOUNTS \nUNDER THE NEW YORK RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. \n3.

GREAGAN, ESQ.\n885 Third Avenue\nNew York,  New York  10022-4834\nGary L. Sharpe\nU.S. District Judge\n\nMEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER\nI. Introduction\nThere are two unresolved questions remaining in this action: (1)\nshould the judge recuse himself; and (2) should the court sanction plaintiffs’\ncounsel, Elmer Keach, III, Esq.  The question of sanctions arises from both\nthe court’s sua sponte motion and the motion of defense counsel, William\nGreagan, Esq.  The recusal question arises from Keach’s response to the\ncourt’s motion.  For the reasons that follow, the court denies the recusal\nmotion and declines to sanction Keach. \nII.  Background\nThe question of sanctions arises in the context of a class action\nlitigation consumed by attorney acrimony throughout its four year history. \nDuring settlement negotiations in 2006, the attorneys collectively filed eight\nletters that were purportedly related to their negotiations.1  (See Dkt. Nos.\n86, 87, and 91 through 96.)  While the letters reflected an apparent\nintention to keep them free from public disclosure, they were not filed ex\nparte as would have been authorized if the parties were seeking judicial\n1Judicial practices in this district vary regarding the handling of settlement documents. \nSome judges never file the documents, instead housing them in a chamber’s folder.  Others file\nthe documents under seal.  These practices are in a state of flux, principally because of new\nelectronic filing procedures that often leave filing decisions in the hands of lawyers. \n2\n\nassistance with their settlement efforts.  Furthermore, the parties had no\nseparate confidentiality agreement precluding disclosure of the letters. \nGreagan sent five letters and requested that they be filed under seal. \nKeach sent three letters together with sealing requests, but also requested\nthat the court refrain from filing one of the three letters.2\nThereafter, the parties stated they had tentatively settled the suit, and\nthe court scheduled a date for the preliminary approval of the class action\nsettlement.  After the court entered a preliminary approval order, the\nattorneys continued their acrimonious relationship which resulted in further\njudicial intervention and an amended preliminary order.  After still further\njudicial intervention, the final approval hearing was held on September 5,\n2007.  Thereafter, the court issued a November 5, 2007, decision and\norder approving the settlement, but class counsels’ attorneys fees were\nreduced.  Judgment was entered on November 21, 2007.  On December 4,\n2007, class counsel appealed the court’s fee award.\nThereafter, Keach wrote the court on January 4, 2008, and requested\nthe earlier settlement letters be unsealed.  (See Dkt. No. 157.)  As\n2As the court discussed during a later conference, the letters themselves did not\ndisclose subjects classically associated with settlement issues.  (See 2/27/08 Conference\nTranscript at 15-16; Dkt. No. 173 (hereinafter, “C.T.”).) \n3\n\npertinent, his letter stated: \nClass Counsel plans to include these documents in their Joint\nAppendix regarding the pending appeal on attorneys’ fees. \nClass Counsel does not believe there is any present basis to\nhave these items filed with the Court under seal, nor should\nthey have to be filed under seal with the Second Circuit, given\nthat the settlement was finally approved by the Court and a\njudgment to that effect has been entered.\n(See id.)  On January 10, 2008, the court denied his application, stating the\nSecond Circuit had full access to the district court’s sealed documents. \n(Dkt. No. 158.)  On the same day, a local newspaper published an article\nquoting the court’s order.  (See C.T. at 26-27.)\nThereafter, Greagan contacted the clerk’s office requesting guidance\non disciplinary procedures since he apparently intended to seek Keach’s\ndisbarment.  The court’s courtroom deputy referred Greagan to the\nDistrict’s Local Rules.  Despite those rules, Greagan filed a letter with the\ncourt seeking disciplinary action against Keach, and mailed a copy of the\nletter to Keach.  Given the sensitivity of Greagan’s allegations, the\nlongstanding animosity between Greagan and Keach, and the court’s\nregard for fundamental fairness, the court elected not to file Greagan’s\nletter.  Instead, it scheduled a conference to discuss the matter.\nIn Greagan’s letter, he mentioned his conversation concerning\n4\n\ndisciplinary procedures.  When Keach received his copy, he called\nchambers on January 23, 2008, and spoke to the court’s courtroom deputy. \nAs reflected in a “chambers only” docket entry on that date, Keach accused\nthe court of engaging in ex parte communications with Greagan, and\ndemanded an explanation.  After his telephone conversation, Keach\napparently thought better of his accusation, and wrote the court a letter\nostensibly addressing the unrelated Greagan disbarment application.  In a\nfootnote, he stated: “I want to make clear that by making this request, I am\nnot implying that either the Court or its staff engaged in any impermissible\nex parte communications with Mr. Greagan about the substance of his\napplication to have me disbarred.”  (See 1/23/08 Keach Ltr. at 2, fn. 1, Dkt.\nNo. 161; see also C.T. at 49-50.)\nOn February 27, the court held the scheduled conference.  The court\ndenied Greagan’s unfiled disbarment motion, again informing him that\ndisciplinary matters must be referred to the Chief Judge.  After reciting the\nhistory of the settlement letters and the district’s varying filing procedures\npost-electronic filing, the court addressed two specific issues: first, Keach’s\nletter to the court seeking to unseal because of the pending appeal; and\nsecondly, Keach’s allegations regarding improper judicial ex parte\n5\n\ncommunications.\nAs to the first issue and referencing the court’s order denying his\napplication to unseal, the following exchange occurred:\nThe Court: So at the same time you requested that I unseal\ndocuments for purposes of your appeal before the Second\nCircuit, did you disclose my order denying that to the Times\nUnion as it related to their newspaper article that day?\nMr. Keach: Relative to Your Honor’s order which was placed on\nthe ECF system, yes.\nThe Court: Did you lie to me in your letter to me telling me that\nyou wanted the documents unsealed for purposes of your\nappellate proceedings when, in truth, you wanted them\nunsealed so you could disclose something to the Times Union?\nMr. Keach: No.\nThe Court: Was that one of your purposes in requesting\nunsealing by me?\nMr. Keach: I believe those documents should be subjected to\npublic disclosure, yes...\nThe Court: Did you disclose that purpose to me in your\napplication to unseal?\nMr. Keach: No, I don’t believe that was reflected in the letter.\nThe Court: All right.  So what you’re telling me is you engaged\nin subterfuge with an application to the Court to unseal documents when, in\nfact, you had an ulterior motive for unsealing those documents that had\nnothing to do with the reason for which you asked me to unseal them; is\nthat what you’re telling me?\n6\n\nMr. Keach: I don’t believe that is – that is accurate, no.  I\nbelieve - and I wrote in that letter that there was no present\nreason that those documents should be filed under seal.  And\nso the record is clear -\nThe Court: Are you telling me you were without knowledge that\nthe Circuit has authority to review unsealed – or sealed\ndocuments in connection with any appeal they’re entertaining of\nmaterials or issues that are ongoing in the district court?\nMr. Keach: Actually, Your Honor, the Second Circuit had to\nspecifically request that those documents be provided by the\nclerk’s office....\n(See C.T. at 26-28.)  During a subsequent colloquy, the court told Keach\nthat his unsealing letter was disingenuous fueled by his own ulterior\nmotives, not some Second Circuit protocol.  (See id. at 48-49.) \nParenthetically, and consistent with appellate procedure, the court\nsubsequently transmitted the sealed documents to the Circuit at its request. \n(See Dkt. Nos. 163-64 & 2/06/08 Chambers Entry.)\nAs to the Keach’s allegation of ex parte communications and his\nsubsequent letter, the court advised Keach as follows:\nThe Court: ... In my view that is a specific, hang up the phone,\noh, my God, what did I just say to the Court.  Let me do what I\nhave a history of doing, denying that I meant what I said and I’ll\ndocument it in a letter so that later on I’ve got plausible\ndeniability over the fact that I just accused the Court of illegal\nex parte communications. \n7\n\n(See C.T. at 50.)\n  After then reciting Keach’s recurring problems with other judges in\nthe Northern District, the court then admonished:\nThe Court: ... You have been dancing on a thin wire for a long\ntime in this district, Mr. Keach.  And you ought to be mindful of\nwhat you said about a half an hour ago that these kinds of\nproceedings have a dramatic impact on your ability to earn a\nliving in a variety of courts in a variety of jurisdictions.  I\nappreciate that.  I’m not sure that you appreciate it.  I’m not\nsure you listen to yourself when you say those things, as is\ndemonstrated by this pattern of behavior that I’ve just recited to\nyou.\n(See id. at 51-52.)\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the court issued a sua sponte order\ndirecting Keach to show cause as to why he should not be sanctioned.  He\nresponded with a recusal motion and opposition to the imposition of\nsanctions.  (See Dkt. No. 182.)  Greagan also filed a sanctions motion. \n(See Dkt. Nos. 176-77.)\nIII.  Discussion\nA.  Recusal\nKeach seeks recusal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §455.  He claims that the\ncourt’s comments during the underlying proceedings reflect a personal\nbias, and that the court cannot resolve factual disputes without a hearing\n8\n\npitting his credibility against that of court personnel.\nRecusal is mandated when a judge’s “impartiality might reasonably\nbe questioned.”  28 U.S.C. § 455(a).  Similarly, § 455(b)(1) provides for\nrecusal when a judge “has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.” \n28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1).  Furthermore, § 144 requires recusal if a judge\nharbors a “personal bias or prejudice” against a party.  28 U.S.C. § 144. \nThe decision to recuse rests within the sound discretion of the judge whose\nrecusal is sought. See United States v. Lovaglia, 954 F.2d 811, 815 (2d\nCir. 1992) (citation omitted).\nBecause the statutory language in §§ 144 and 455(b)(1) is similar\nand the scope of both is identical, courts have concluded that they should\nbe construed together. See Apple v. Jewish Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 829 F.2d\n326, 333 (2d Cir. 1987).  Under both, the recusal standard is “whether a\nreasonable person, knowing all the facts, would conclude that the court’s\nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.” Id. Significantly, “[t]he\nalleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an\nextrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis\nother than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.” \nUnited States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583 (1966) (emphasis\n9\n\nadded); see also Apple, 829 F.2d at 333 (noting that the analysis “looks to\nextrajudicial conduct as the basis for making such a determination, not\nconduct which arises in a judicial context”).  Moreover, the Supreme Court\nhas observed that “judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are\ncritical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their\ncases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality charge.” Liteky v. United\nStates, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994).\nAs evidence of bias, prejudice and impartiality, Keach references: (1)\nseveral statements made by the court during the February 27 conference;\n(2) the court’s consideration of extrajudicial matters concerning past uncivil\nbehavior; and (3) the court’s failure to credit his letter disavowing any\nintention of accusing the court of engaging in ex parte communication.\nSpecifically, Keach claims that the court showed bias and prejudice when it\n“forcefully expressed its view that [his] past alleged instances of uncivil\nconduct make it more likely, if not certain, that he is guilty of the conduct\nalleged . . .”  (Keach Mem. of Law at 23; Dkt. No. 182.)\nKeach concedes he has been warned by other Northern District\njudges over the last six years about his uncivil behavior and discovery\nabuse.  In fact, this court personally warned him earlier in this litigation.  He\n10\n\nargues, however, that just because a lawyer is discourteous, it does not\naxiomatically follow that the lawyer is dishonest.  While he acknowledges\nprior warnings about uncivil behavior, he argues that he has often admitted\nthose allegations and his admissions demonstrate honesty, not dishonesty. \nDespite his arguments, Keach has failed to identify any evidence of\nbias or prejudice stemming from an extrajudicial source.  Moreover, the\ncourt affirmatively disclaims that any exist.  In reality, Keach simply\nspeculates about the courts views, and does so because the court has now\nchallenged his conduct twice in this case.  Indeed, lawyers are foolhardy if\nthey fail to realize that judges assess their integrity and honesty during all\njudicial interactions.  Judges inevitably make credibility assessments in\nmuch of what they do - whether in the context of arguments advanced by\ncounsel, testimony of witnesses, or, for that matter, when assessing\nmundane matters such as the genuineness of a proffered reason for an\nextension request.  For precisely that reason, the court would have no\ndifficulty in making credibility determinations in this matter if required to do\nso.  When judging credibility, courts use the same tools employed by all\nrational human beings called upon to do the same.  Thus, a person’s\nreputation for integrity may be critical which is precisely why lawyers must\n11\n\nrecognize that their integrity is something they alone control.  Once\nrelinquished, integrity is extremely difficult to retrieve.  Lastly, judges\nrecognize that the burden of proof serves to resolve close credibility issues,\nand they typically impose a similar burden on themselves when deciding\nwhat, if any action, they ought to take.  Consequently, the court believes\nthat more often than not, it errs on the side of caution.\nIn the court’s view, there is no evidence of extrajudicial bias,\nprejudice, or impartiality in this record.  The only possible argument to the\ncontrary is the court’s recitation of Keach’s prior history in other cases. \nHowever, the court’s only purpose in identifying that history was to afford\nKeach a fair opportunity to address it in any post-conference submission\ndiscussing the appropriateness of sanctions.  The court was not laboring\nunder any predetermined conclusions drawn from allegations in other\ncases.  Accordingly, there is no bias or prejudice, and Keach’s motion for\nrecusal is denied.\nB.  Sanctions\nBecause the court has recently discussed sanctions authority, a\nsuccinct summary is appropriate.  An attorney may be sanctioned: (1)\npursuant to Fed. Civ. Pro. R. 11 if he files a paper for an improper purpose;\n12\n\nor (2) pursuant to the court’s inherent authority if he acts in bad faith,\nvexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons; or (3) if he “multiplies the\nproceedings . . . unreasonably and vexatiously . . . .” See Zlotnick v.\nAretakis, 572 F. Supp.2d 258, 271-273 (N.D.N.Y. 2008).  In general,\nsanctions should be reserved for those instances of subjective bad faith on\nthe part of the offending attorney. \nAs the court clearly intimated during the February 27 conference, the\nclouded legal issues in this district regarding sealed settlement documents\ndo not warrant the imposition of sanctions.  First of all, the court made no\nindependent judgment regarding the propriety of sealing the documents in\nthe first place. See generally Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).  Without an accompanying application to seal, the\nparties labeled the documents and the court simply filed them under seal. \nFurthermore, both parties had copies of the documents and they never\nexecuted a confidentiality agreement nor sought a protective order.  Thus,\nit is not at all clear that disclosure of the documents would have violated a\ncourt order.  Absent such clarity, the imposition of sanctions is not\nwarranted.\nThe circumstances surrounding Keach’s unsealing letter and his\n13\n\naccusations concerning ex parte communications are more troubling. \nCollectively, they cause the court to question his candor and honesty. \nRather than simply apologize for having been less than fully forthcoming in\nhis unsealing letter, his post-conference affidavit again reverts to his\n“perfecting an appeal” justification to explain his conduct in the first place. \n(See Keach Affidavit, Dkt. No. 182-1.)  As the earlier quoted colloquy\ndemonstrates, Keach admitted that his search for publicity was a\nmotivating factor in seeking to unseal.  Again, however, his post-\nconference affidavit is particularly sparse as to those details.  (See id. at ¶\n11.)  Furthermore, his publicity admission only surfaced during the colloquy\nafter the court was essentially forced to cross-examine him.  So too, the\ngenuineness of his position is undercut by the court’s familiarity with routine\nCircuit procedures for gathering a sealed record.  That observation does\nnot foreclose the possibility that a Circuit case manager may have\nsuggested approaching the district court with an application to unseal. \nWhether that actually occurred is irrelevant.  What is relevant is seeking\njudicial relief without complete candor as to why the relief is being sought in\nthe first place.  As an officer of the court, counsel has a continuing duty of\ncandor to the tribunal. Burns v. Windsor Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 1092,1095 (11th\n14\n\nCir. 1994).\nAs for the ex parte accusation, the court will not hold a hearing to get\nat the so-called “truth.”  Keach should be mindful of two things.  First\nchambers manages pending cases with detailed docket notations reflected\nin “chambers only entries” that are not otherwise available to the public. \nConversations with attorneys are documented in those entries, especially\nwhen past experience demonstrates that such conversations should be\ndocumented.  The court reviewed those entries before the February 27\nconference.  Secondly, Keach’s same-day letter with its unrelated footnot\ndisclaimer about allegations of misconduct suggests a concern on his part\nthat someone might have construed the allegation in that way.\nWhat has been said bears repeating.  Judges routinely make\ncredibility judgments.  Lawyers who give away their integrity find it difficult\nto retrieve.  Sanctions are appropriate when an attorney’s representations\nsubjectively reflect bad faith or, worse yet, when a statement is uttered as a\nbaseless allegation of judicial misconduct.  Nonetheless, judges tend to err\non the side of caution, especially when - as the court observed during the\nconference colloquy - an attorney’s livelihood is at stake.\nIV.  Conclusion\n15\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court denies Keach’s recusal motion,\ndeclines to impose judicial sanctions, and denies Greagan’s motion for\nsanctions.\nAccordingly, it is hereby \nORDERED that Keach’s motion for recusal (Dkt. No. 182) is DENIED;\nand it is further\nORDERED that Greagan’s motion for sanctions (Dkt. Nos. 176-77) is\nDENIED; and it is further\nORDERED that the court DECLINES to impose judicial sanctions\npursuant to its order to show cause; and it is further\nORDERED that the Clerk provide a copy of this Decision and Order\nto the parties.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nFebruary 27, 2009\nAlbany, New York \n16",

Introduction \n \nOn behalf of the Settlem ent Class certified by the Court on October 25, 2006, Plaintiff  \nLessie Davies and Class Counsel hereby m ove for final approval of the class action settlement, \nincluding an award of counsel fees, expenses and incentive payments to the Class Representative \nand a proposed intervenor.  Class Counsel respectfully suggests to the Court that the $2.5 million \nsettlement  of  the Class’ cla ims  against Sc henectady  County provides Class Mem bers  with \nexceptional relief when compared with other recent settlements in similar cases, and should be \napproved by the Court. \nII.  Procedural Background \n  This action was filed on June 29, 2004 as a proposed class  action seeking to address the \nconduct of illegal strip searches at the Schenectady County Jail.  The Named Plaintiffs, Nichole \nMcDaniel  and Lessie Davies, alleged that th e  Schenectady County Sheriff’s Departm ent \nemployed a uniform policy and/or practice of strip searching all detainees admitted to the \nSchenectady County Jail on misdemeanor or other minor charges.   This action was the subject \nof intense litigation from the date of the Court’s Rule 16 conference until the parties reached the \nwithin settlement.  The Plaint iffs took eight depositions, in cluding the deposition of Major \nRobert Elwell (the SCJ Jail Superintendant)  and several Corrections  Officers, the Defendants \ndeposed Class Representative Lessie Davies, and the parties filed a multitude of discovery \ndisputes for decision by Magistrate Judge Randolph F. Treece.  (Docket entries 8, 13-16, 18-24, \n27-28, 62-63).  The De fendants unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment on the bases of  \npersonal jurisdiction and the damages limitations of the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) \n(docket entries 33, 58), and both parties appealed some of  Judge Treece’s rulings to the District \nCourt (docket entries 29, 43).   The Defendants also moved to dismiss the claims of Class \n  1\n\nRepresentative Nichole McDaniel, who failed to appear for her deposition despite a Court Order \nthat she do so.    \n  The efforts to settle this action begin in  early 2005, and the partie s participated in a \nsettlement conference with Judge Treece on May  17, 2005.  W hile this settlement conference \nwas unsuccessful, Judge Treece laid the groundwork for the ultimate resolution of this action, as \nit was his suggestion regarding the m onetary amount of the settlement  that was ultimately \nincorporated into the Settlement Agreement.  Settlement discussions began in earnest after the \nDistrict Court denied the Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment in September 2005, with \nthose negotiations lasting for over nine m onths.  While the parties agreed  on the monetary \namount of the settlement early in the process, several months passed as they negotiated the actual \nterms of the settlement, including extensive injunctive relief.  The negotiations leading to the \nculmination of the Settlement Agreement were as contentious as the litigation, with several drafts \nof the agreements being exchanged and the p arties ultimately seeking intervention from the \nCourt when reaching a stalem ate on one very contentious issue.  ( See, Docket Entries 91-96).  \nThe parties finally reached a settlement on July 31, 2006, and moved for preliminary approval on \nAugust 18, 2006.  The Court provided prelim inary approval of the Settlement on October 25, \n2006, after which notice was mailed to the class members and published in accordance with the \nsettlement  agreement,  and class mem bers  filed  claims.   Plaintiff Le ssie  Davies  and Class \nCounsel now move for final approval of the Settlement. \nIII.  Terms of the Settlement and Settlement Administration \nThe case was settled by the Defendants agreeing to consent to the certification of the case \nas a class action for settlement purposes, and agreeing to set up a common fund of $2.5 million  \nto pay claims to class members.  Schenectady County also agreed to extensive injunctive relief, \n  2\n\nincluding  implementing  a new strip search po licy  and training all of its officers on the \nrequirements of the new policy.   See, Settlement Agreement, p. 10,  part III(A) (exhibit A to \nKeach  affirmation).   The settlem ent  was stru ctured  to p rovide  $1.75  million  for  pro  rata \npayments to class members who made claims on the settlement, with the remaining funds to pay \nadministrative costs, incentive awards to the class representative and a prospective intervenor, \nand attorneys’ fees and costs. \nAs the Court is aware, the adversarial nature of this proceeding continued even after a \nsettlement was reached.  In an effort to facilita te notice to the Settlem ent Class, Class Counsel \nattempted to compel production of the computerized booking records from  the County.  The \nCourt denied this request, and the Defendants produced the paper booking sheets for members of \nthe class.  (See, Docket Entry 106).  Those booking sheets, however, were in som e cases \nincomplete in that they  did not contain proper contact inform ation for many class members.    \nAdditionally,  the Defendants provided Cla ss  Counsel several thousand booking sheets for \nindividuals who were not members of the class because they were charged with felonies or were \nalready convicted when they entered the custody of the Schenectady County Jail.  Class Counsel \naccordingly sought, and received, leave of Co urt to delay the commencement of the claim s \nperiod, and then went through all 6,500 booking sh eets by hand to determine who was, and was \nnot, a member of the Class.  Aft er this review, Class Counsel determ ined that there were \napproximately 3,245 class members, and commenced the Notice Program. \nStarting  in early January, 2007, the Settlem ent  Administrator  mailed  notice of the \nsettlement  (the “long f orm”  notice”) (exhib it  B  to  Keach  affidavit) to all m embers  of the \nSettlement Class.  Additionally, Class Counsel placed a summary of the long-form notice (the \n“short-form notice”) in the Al bany Times-Union and Schenectady Gazette (exhibit C to Keach \n  3\n\naffidavit), and also set up a settlement website, www.scjsettlement.com, which contained copies \nof the notices and other court documents.  The Settlement Administrator also maintained a toll \nfree telephone number for individuals to call in and receive copies the settlement notice or ask \nquestions.   \nA  sizable  majority  of  the in itial  mailing  of  the long -form  notices were re turned  as \nundeliverable.  The Settlement Administrator then forwarded the notice to alternative addresses \ncontained on Schenectady County’s booking records.   For instance, detainees would often have \nmultiple  bookings,  with m ultiple  addresses  listed.  Deta inees  would  also som etimes  have \nalternative contact information, such as attorneys or next of ki n, on their booking sheets.  When \nnotices were returned as being undeliverable, the  Settlement Administrator then sent notices to \nthese alternative addresses.  Many of those noti ces were also returned as being undeliverable, \nand the Settlement Administrator then used a national locator database, as well as Schenectady \nDepartment of Social Services re cords, to continue their locatio n efforts.  Lead C lass Counsel \nalso fielded a range of questions on the Settle ment, both over the phone and in writing, and als o \nsupplied class notices and claim forms to many individuals.   \nAs the initial claims period came to an end, counsel for both parties was concerned about \nthe rate of participation in the Settlement, and sought leave of Court to extend the claims period \nfor 30 days.  During that tim e, Lead Class Counsel began, or continued, supplemental efforts to \nlocate absent class members.  A phone bank was set up, and all members of the Settlement Class \nwho listed a telephone number on their booking sheets, either for themselves or a contact person, \nwere contacted by either Attorney Keach, his paralegal, or an intern in his office.  Class Counsel \nalso supervised efforts to locate Class Mem bers who were incarcerated by attem pting to locate \nthem on the New York State Departm ent of Correctional Services website.  Finally, during the \n  4\n\nfinal days of the Notice campaign, Attorney Keach spent two days in the Ham ilton Hill area of \nSchenectady attempting to facilitate additional claims on the Settlement.  The first day Attorney \nKeach spent walking on foot through Ha milton Hill, handing out class notices, claim forms and \nhandbills, and assisting individuals that he spoke  with to determ ine whether or not they were  \nmembers of the Settlement Class.1  The second day, Attorney Keach made himself available at a \ncommunity organization in Schene ctady (Jobs, Etc.) to ans wer questions from class members \nand assist individuals with filing claims.   \nThe claims period concluded on June 5, 2007.  As of that date, 861 claims had been filed \non the Settlement Fund from individuals for whom there is a Schenectady County Jail booking  \nsheet showing that individual is a class m ember.  Fourteen late claims have been filed on the  \nSettlement as of July 5, 2007.  Addition ally, 146 claims were received from individuals who \nwere initially determined not to be members of the Settlement Class.  Each of those individuals \nreceived a letter informing them that their claim was invalid, and that they would have to submit \nadditional information to be considered a class member.  (Exhibit D).  Class Counsel has, and is \npresently, contacting these indivi duals to seek more inform ation about their situation; som e \nindividuals who were initially believed to not be class members submitted information showing \nthat they were.  In add ition, the Defendants submitted provided additional documentation for \nthese individuals, with m any, as the result of that add itional information, added to the list of \nvalid claims.2  These efforts will continue up until the time of final approval.   \n                                                 \n1 During this first day, Attorney Keach was accompanied by Plummer Bradley, a community activist who also wrote \nto the Court in support of Class Counsel’s efforts to prosecute this action.  During the course of his time on \nHamilton Hill, Attorney Keach spoke to several individuals who were unaware of their membership in the Class, \nincluding one gentleman who could not read, and assisted them in filing claims.   \n2 Class Counsel will file affidavits from the Settlement Administrator and Website Administrator as part of their \nsupplemental submission on Friday, July 27, 2007. \n  5\n\nOnly two individuals have opt ed out of the settlem ent, and one untimely objection was \nfiled by Class Member Keith Harris.  Mr. Harris’ letter to the Court did not reflect the basis for \nhis objection, only the he “objects ” and “intends to appear” at  the Final Approval Hearing. 3  \nCurrently, 26.5% of the class filed claim s on the settlement.  While Class Counsel plans to  \nprovide the Court with a final class list at the  time of the Final Approval Hearing, they believe, \nbased on current claims, that class members will receive between $1,900 and $2,000 as their pro \nrata share of the Settlement Fund. \nIV.  Argument \nPOINT I \nTHE COURT SHOULD APPROVE THE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT, AS THE \nSETTLEMENT IS FAR, REASONABLE AND ADEQUATE, AND IS NOT THE \nPRODUCT OF COLLUSION \n \nA court must approve the settlement of a class action before it can take effect.  “Before \nsuch  a settlem ent  may  be approved, the distri ct  court must deter mine  that a class ac tion \nsettlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable, and not a product of collusion.”   Joel A. v. Guiliani, \n218 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 2000).  The fairness, ade quacy, and reasonableness of the settlement \nis often called “substantive fairness,” and the issue of possible collusion is known as “procedural \nfairness.”  In Re Holocaust Vic tim Asset Litig., 105 F.Supp.2d 139, 145 (E.D.N.Y. 2000).  In \nevaluating procedural fairness, courts consider “the negotiating process, examined in light of the \nexperience of counsel, the vigor with which th e case was prosecuted, and the coercion or \ncollusion that may have marred the negotiations themselves.”  Malachman v. Davis, 706 F.2d \n426, 433 (2d Cir. 1983).  In evaluating substantive  fairness, courts consider the nine factors \nenumerated in City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448 (2d Cir. 1974): \n                                                 \n3 Mr. Harris is presently incarcerated in the Five Points Correctional Facility on Robbery charges, and is not eligible \nfor parole until next year.  Exhibit G.   \n  6\n\n1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; 2) the reaction of \nthe class to the settlement; 3) the stag e of the proceed ings and the amount of \ndiscovery  completed;  4) the risks of  establishing  liability;  5) th e  risks of  \nestablishing damages; 6) the risks of maintaining the class action through trial; 7) \nthe ability of the defendants to w ithstand a greater judgm ent; 8) the range of \nreasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; 9) the \nrange of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all \nthe attendant risks of litigation. \n \nId., at 463 (citations omitted).  Finally, “it is not a  district judge’s job to  dictate the terms of a \nclass settlement; he should approve or disapprove a proposed ag reement as it is placed before  \nhim and should not take it upon himself to m odify the terms.”  In Re Warner Communications \nSec. Litig., 798 F.2d 35, 37 (2d Cir. 1986).   \nA.  The Settlement is Procedurally Fair \nThe conduct of counsel in this litigation,  and during settlement negotiations, leaves no \ndoubt  that the settlem ent  was achieved as th e  result of lengthy, adversarial and difficult \nnegotiations.  These negotiations were conducted both during and after substantial discovery had \nbeen completed by the parties.  The parties enga ged in settlement negotiations, on and off, for  \napproximately eighteen months, and participated in some of these negotiations before Magistrate \nJudge Treece.  Despite agreeing on the monetary terms of the Settlement in November 2006, the \nparties spent several months arguing about the language of the Settlement Agreement, injunctive \nrelief provisions, notice provisions, the timing of the settlement and the provision of attorneys’ \nfees to Class Counsel.4  On one occasion, the D istrict Court became directly involved in these \nissues.   \n                                                 \n4 As will be detailed later, the percentage agreed upon for attorneys’ fees was based on the percentage discussed, and \nawarded, in Nilsen v. York County, 400 F. Supp.2d 266 (D. Me. 2005).  Specifically, the District of Maine provided \na 25% attorneys’ fee in a common fund strip search settlement, utilizing a “market-mimicking analysis.”  Id., at 283.  \nThe parties in this action agreed to pay 26% of the fund as an award of attorneys’ fees, with the additional \npercentage being intended to compensate for pre-settlement litigation costs.   \n  7\n\nThese  negotiations were conducted by “experi enced  counsel” who engaged in “the \ndiscovery necessary to effective repres entation of the class’s in terests.”  Maley v. Del Global \nTechnologies Corp., 186 F.Supp.2d 358, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).  They w ere also “extensive, hard \nfought and took place at arm ’s length between e xperienced and skilled attorneys,” as they \noccurred over a period of several months, involve d many meetings and teleconferences with all \ncounsel, and involved the Defendants’ insurance carriers.  Id.  “In this context, courts routinely \nadd the voice of experienced counsel to the m ix of considered factors.”   Id.  Here, counsel for \nboth parties recommend to the Court that it finally approve the proposed class action settlement.  \nClass  Counsel  also co nfirms  for  the Cour t  that the m anner  in  which this   settlement  was \nnegotiated was highly adversarial;  so adversarial that Class C ounsel was concerned that the \nSettlement  Agreement  would not be finali zed  and approved by the Schenectady County \nLegislature.5 \nAccordingly, the parties at all times were  acting in a procedurally fair, arm s-length \nmanner, and there is no hint of  collusion to the Settlement.  The Settlement is thus procedurally \nfair.  \nB.  The Settlement is Substantively Fair. \nThe Plaintiffs respectfully suggest to the Court that, when applying the Grinnell factors to \nthe Settlement, the overw helming majority of those factor s strongly favor a finding that the \nSettlement is substantively fair to the Class and should be approved.   \n1.  Complexity, Expense and Likely Duration of Litigation \n                                                 \n5 As the Court is aware, there was a very serious disagreement over the timing of the Settlement that almost derailed \nnegotiations.  Additionally, the Settlement was vociferously opposed by several members of the Schenectady \nCounty Legislature who were quoted in the Schenectady Gazette as referring to Class Counsel as being “gangsters in \nthree piece suits” and being “shaken down.”   \n  8\n\nThe Plaintiffs respectfully suggest that this factor strongly favors the final approval of the \nSettlement.  While this action was s ettled prior to the Plaintiffs’ moving for class certification, \nthe underlying litigation was complex, and would likely become more complex as it progressed.  \nThe  parties  had rou tinely  applied  to Judg e  Treece  for intervention   in d iscovery  disputes, \nincluding disputes over the costs of docum ent production, the application of the attorney-client \nprivilege  and work product doctr ine,  the failure of Nichole  McDaniel  to app ear  for her \ndeposition and the consequences of that failure,  and discovery of the nam es of class members.  \nSome of these disputes led to appeals to the Di strict Court, and the Defendants also moved for \nSummary Judgment on service issues and the PLRA.  The Defendants’ request for permission to \napply to the Second Circuit for an interlocutory appeal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b), was \npending at the time settlement negotiations began in earnest.  \nGoing  forward, the  Plaintiffs faced  the addi tional  burden  and expense  of additional  \ndiscovery, filing a motion for class certification,  trying the case as to liability, if  summary \njudgment was not available.  In all likelihood, the Defendants would have appealed, or attempted \nto  appeal, any num ber  of disput ed  issues, including taking an  interlocutory  appeal of any \nqualified immunity issues as to the individual Defendants.   \nEven after the liability issues would have been resolved, the parties would have then had \nto address the damages phase of the case, which may have required determinations of individual \ndamages for each class member.  Accordingly, “[t]he potential for this litigation to result in great \nexpense and to continue for a l ong time suggest that settlem ent is in the best interests of the \nClass.”  Slomovics v. All For A Dollar, 906 F. Supp. 146 (S.D.N.Y. 1995), and the first Grinnell \nfactor favors final approval of the Settlement. \n2.  Reaction of the Class to the Settlement \n  9\n\nThe  Class’s  reaction to   the Settle ment  also  favors final approval.  Only one class \nmember, out of 3,200, has objected to the Settlem ent, and his objection was not timely filed and \ndoes not state the basis for his objection.  Only two individuals filed a request for exclusion.  One \nclass member, Plummer Bradley, wrote to the Court  to praise the Settlement and the efforts of \nClass Counsel.  (Exhibit F).  “It is well settled that  the reaction of the class to the settlem ent is \nperhaps the most significant factor to be weighed in considering its adequacy.  In fact, the lack of \nobjections may well evidence the fairness of the settlement”  Maley, 186 F. Supp.2d at 362 \n(citations omitted).  Other cases have held that relatively low numbers of objectors are indicative \nof the adequacy of the settlem ent.  See, D’Amato v. Deutsche Bank,  296 F.3d 78, 86 (2d Cir. \n2001) (18 objectors of 27,883 class no tices weighed in favor of s ettlement).  The lack of \nobjectors and opt-outs in this case, therefore, shows that the reaction of the class to the settlement \nis extremely favorable.   \nAdditionally, the number of claims filed on the Settlement is commensurate with, or \ngreater,  than claim s  rates in other strip se arch  cases.  Here, approxim ately  26.5% of the \nSettlement Class has filed a claim .  This percenta ge will likely rise slightly as class counsel \ncontinues to investigate claims that initially appear invalid.  This claims rate is comparable to the \nclaims rates achieved by Class Counsel in other strip search cases in this District,  including a \n28% claims rate in the Rensselaer County Ja il case and 29% in the  Montgomery County Jail \ncase.  (Keach Aff., ¶ 5).  This  claims rate is also far higher th an other recent strip search \nsettlements in New York, and slightly higher th an others from other judicial districts.   See, \nMcBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 381-2 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (3,402 of 40,352, or 8.4%, \nof class members made valid claims); Doan v. Watson, 2002 WL 31730917 (S.D. Ind. December \n4, 2002) (619 of 2,591 class members, or 24%); Eddleman v. Jefferson County, No. 91-CV 144-J \n  10\n\n(W.D. Ky.) (Exhibit H, p. 7) (50,000 class no tices, yielding approximately 12,000 claims; 24% \nclaims rate).  Class Counsel respectfully suggests to the Court that the claims rate in this case has \nbeen achieved because of counsel’s extensive notice efforts that go well beyond the mailing of a \nwritten notice and newspaper publication.  The fact  that the class members responded and made \nclaims at a high rate, coupled with the limited number of opt-outs and objectors, shows that the \nreaction of the class to the proposed settlement has been overwhelmingly positive.       \n3.  Stage of Proceedings and Amount of Discovery Completed \nThe third Grinnell factor also favors approval of the  Settlement.  This action was the \nsubject of extensive discovery at the time it was resolved, with the Plaintiffs taking extensive \ndeposition  testimony  of the Jail co mmanders  and corrections officers.  Addition ally,  Class \nCounsel compelled production of all class m ember booking sheets, and also received a decision \nfrom the Court allowing them to talk to current SCJ Corrections Officers outside of the presence \nof Defendants’ counsel.  The P laintiffs also successfully defended the Defendants’ summary \njudgment motion regarding the Prisoners’ Litigation Reform Act.  “The stage of the proceedings \nand the amount of discovery completed is another factor that may be considered in determining \nthe fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of a settlement.  To approve a settlement, however, the \nCourt need not find that the parties ha ve engaged in extensive discovery.”   Maley, 186 F. \nSupp.2d at 363.  Final approval of  a class action settlem ent is appropriate where “Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel possessed a record sufficient to perm it evaluation of Plaintiffs’ claims, the strengths of \nthe defenses asserted by Defendants, and the value of Plaintiffs’ causes of action for purposes of \nsettlement.”  Id., at 364.  Class Counsel respectfully sugg ests that they have taken sufficient \ndiscovery to substantiate their request for Fina l Approval, and that application of the third \nGrinnell factors favors the approval of the settlement. \n  11\n\n4.  The Risks of Establishing Liability a nd Damages, and Risk of Maintaining \nClass Action Through Trial \n \nClass Counsel admits that the fourth  Grinnell factor, risk establishing liability, does not \nsignificantly favor Final Approval. 6  In the afterm ath of this Court’s decision in  Marriott v. \nCounty of Montgomery,  227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (certif ication of strip search class \naction where Judge Hurd held that  a so-called “change out” sim ilar to that described in Robert \nElwell’s testimony was unconstitutional absent reasonable suspicion) and In Re Nassau County \nStrip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219 (2d Cir. 2006 (overruling denial  of class certification in strip \nsearch class action), Class Counsel does not believe that establishing liability and receiving class \ncertification were significant obstacles in this litigation.  They also do not believe that the PLRA \nwould preclude class members from receiving compensation for violation of their constitutional \nrights by the County, see, Kelsey v. County of Schoharie,  2005 WL 1972557 (N.D.N.Y. August \n5, 2005), despite the existen ce of a District C ourt case to the contrary ( Cox v. Malone, 199 \nF.Supp.2d 235 (S.D.N.Y 2002)).  The only possible  defense the Defendants could have raised \nwas that they relied upon their former written policies, which were revised at least twice during \nthe class period, and that those policies were a ppropriate.  Class Counsel does not believe this \nwould have been a successful defense, but “it is  enough to observe, howeve r, that there are no \nguaranties in life, and while it appears likely that plaintiffs would be able to establish liability at \ntrial, things change.”  McBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 337, 387 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).       \nThe risk of establishing damages for each individual class member, however, is another \nstory entirely.  The possibility that some members of the Settlement Class, especially individuals \nwith  extensive  criminal  histories  and/or  a  history  of incarceration,   would receive nom inal \ndamages from a jury or special m aster.  See, Shain v. E llison, 356 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2004) \n                                                 \n6 Class Counsel believes that the risks associated with this action were much higher at the time it was filed, June \n2004, and discusses this fact in their arguments about attorneys’ fees.   \n  12\n\n(awarding nominal damages to an attorney who  was strip searched at the Nassau County Jail); \nMcBean, 233 F.R.D. 377 at 387 (discussing this factor in a strip search class action).  Certainly, \nfor many class members, receiving $2,000 from a jury for being illegally strip searched is not  a \ncertainty, and would be subjected to a vigorous defense by the Defendants.  If the case were not \nto settle, each class m ember would, in all li kelihood, be required to prove their own e motional \ndistress at trial.  This would be an inhere ntly subjective and inex act undertaking, and woul d \nexpose each class member to substantial uncertainty, the risk of getting only a nominal award, \nand the additional distress of having testify.  This assumes, of  course, that the Court would \ncertify this action for damages, and that a class wide damages trial, or individual inquests, would \nbe manageable. \nThe Court here need not “decide the merits of the case,” Carlson v. American Brands, \nInc., 450 U.S. 79, 88, n. 14 (1981), rath er, the Court must only “weigh the likelihood of success \nby the plaintiff class against the relief offered by the settlem ent.”  Marisol A. v. Giulani,  185 \nF.R.D. 152, 164 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).  The relief provid ed to Class Members is a payment that will \nlikely  exceed $1,900.00, which is a significant and  substantial  damages  award for a class \nmember who need do nothing more than fill out and mail a claim form.  It is also well in excess \nof other strip search settlements that have recently been settled in New York State, including one \nnegotiated by Class Counsel in this action.   See, Kahler v. County of Rensselaer,  03CV1324 \n(N.D.N.Y.) ($1,000.00 per claim) (Keach aff. para. 5); McBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. \nat 381 ($750 per claimant; $1,000 for claimants strip searched more than once); Maneely v. City \nof Newburgh, 01CV2600(CLB) (S.D.N.Y.) (cited in  McBean at 390-91; $1,000 per claim ant); \nDodge v. County of Orange,  02CV769 (S.D.N.Y.) ($600,000 shared by 18,000 class members) \n(exhibit I).  Other settlements from outside this Judicial Circuit also paid $1,000 per claim.  See, \n  13\n\nDoan v. Watson, 2002 WL31730917, 99-4-C-B/S (S.D. Ind. Dec. 4, 2002)  ($1,000 per claim); \nMoser v. Anderson, No. 93-634-B (D.N.H.) ($1,000 per class  member) (Keach Aff., Ex. 5).    \nTherefore, the relatively low risks of proving liability in this case, when considered together with \nthe substantial relief offered to the class and the inherent risk and uncertainty of having to prove \nemotional distress damages, show that the fourth, fifth and sixth  Grinnell factors favor the \napproval of the settlement here.   \n5.  Ability of the Defendants to Withstand a Greater Judgment \nClass Counsel acknowledges that Schenectady County can withstand a greater judgment.  \nWhile this settlement has largely exhausted the County’s insura nce policy limits, the County, \nupon information and belief, agreed to pay som e public money (less than 10% of the total \nsettlement) into the Settlem ent Fund.  Having  the County sustain a larger judgm ent could, of \ncourse, take money away from its other important governmental responsibilities, or require a tax \nincrease.  “[F]airness does not require that the [municipal defendant] empty its coffers before this \nCourt will approve a settlement….[T]he ability of the defendants to pay more, on its own, does \nnot render the settlem ent unfair, especially where the other  Grinnell factors favor approval.”  \nMcBean, 233 F.R.D. at 388. \n6.  The Range of Reasonableness of the Settlement Fund \nThe eighth Grinnell factor, the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of \nthe best possible recovery, taken  together with the ninth factor,  the range of reasonableness of \nthe settlement fund in light of  all of the attendant risk of  litigation, favors approval of the \nsettlement.  As detailed previously in this memorandum, the anticipated payout to class members \n($1,900 to $2,000) exceeds the payouts in  other similar class actions.  It also far exceeds th e \npossible recovery that some class members would receive in the event they are awarded nominal \n  14\n\ndamages.  While some percentage of class members could achieve verdicts well in excess of the \nsettlement payment, “the settlement allows individuals to opt out and pursue their own claims.”  \nMcBean, 233 F.R.D. at 388.  Class Counsel respectfully suggests that the Proposed Settlement is \nwithin the range of reasonableness, and should be finally approved by the Court. \nPOINT II \nCLASS COUNSEL’S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES IS \nREASONABLE AND SHOULD BE APPROVED BY THE COURT \n \n  Class counsel seeks an award of attorneys’  fees and costs in the am ount of $650,000, or \n26% of the common fund created  by the Settlement.  After extensive negotiation, defendants \nagreed  to pay this am ount  of the fund as at torneys’  fees and not oppose class counsel’s \napplication. See, Parties’ Settlement Agreement.   Th e Court, at this ju ncture, must ascertain \nwhat a fair and reasonable fee would be to compensate class counsel.    \n  Where class counsel create  a common fund, courts use either  the ‘lodestar’ method’ or \nthe ‘percentage of the fund’ method.”  Walmart Stores v. Visa U.S.A., 396 F.3d 96, 121 (2d Cir. \n2005).   See also, Goldberger v. Integrated Resources, 209 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2000).  “The trend in \nthis Circuit is toward the percentage method, which “directly aligns the interests of the class and \nits counsel and provides a powerful incentive for the efficient prosecution and early resolution of \nlitigation.”  Walmart, 396 F.3d at 121.  “In contrast, the lodestar create[s] an unanticipated \ndisincentive to early settlements, tempt[s] lawyers to run up their hours, and com pel[s] district \ncourts  to engage in gim let-eyed  review  of line-ite m  fee audits. ””    Id.  (quoting,  Baffa v. \nDonaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Secs. Corp.,  2002 WL  1315603, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June  17, 2002).  \nJudicial  economy  and efficiency is fostered   by reasonable settlem ents,  and a “prom pt  and \nefficient attorney who achieve s a fair settlement without extensive litigation serves both his \nclient and the interests of justice.”  McKenzie Construction Inc. v. Maynard, 758 F.2d 97, 101-2 \n  15\n\n(3d Cir. 1985).  “In th e context of a com plex class action, early settlement has far reaching \nbenefits in the judicial system.”  Maley, 186 F. Supp.2d at 373.   \n  Here, class counsel requests that the Court ev aluate the requested fees and expenses as a \nreasonable percentage of the $2.5 million common fund it successfully created.  Not only is it the \noverwhelming trend in the district  courts of this Ci rcuit to follow the pe rcentage of the fund \napproach, but judges in two of the more recent, settled strip search cases followed this approach \nas well. Marriott v. County of Montgomery,  03 Civ. 0531 (DNH)(D EP) (N.D.N.Y.); Nilsen v. \nYork County, 400 F.Supp.2d 266 (D. Me. 2005).   \nA.  Application of the “Goldberger” Factors Support the Requested Award of Attorneys’ \nFees. \n \n  In evaluating the reasonableness of the pr oposed attorneys’ fees in a comm on fund \nsettlement, a District Court should look to the following factors:   \n(1) the time and labor expended by counsel; \n(2) the magnitude and complexities of the litigation; \n(3) the risk of the litigation …; \n(4) the quality of representation; \n(5) the requested fee in relation to the settlement; and \n(6) public policy considerations \n \nGoldberger, 209 F.3d at 50.  Class Counsel respectfully suggests that these “Goldberger factors” \nsupport the reasonableness of Class Counsel’s fee application. \nA(1)         The Time and Labor expended by Counsel \nCounsel has spent hundreds of hours of attorn ey time litigating this action, and several \nhundred more in lengthy settlem ent negotiations. See attached Fee Affirmations.   Plaintiffs’ \nClass  Counsel developed, litigated and successf ully  negotiated this  action  by them selves, \n  16\n\nexpending substantial time and effort.”  Maley, 186 F. Supp.2d at 371.  Class counsel will also \ncontinue to resolve the claims of self-identifiers seeking to obtain an  award, administer the \nconclusion of the settlement and locate those class members who do not in itially receive their \nsettlement checks.  They also faced  a competent and determined adversary who aggressiv ely \nlitigated this action for over a year, and continued to aggressively  represent his clients during \nlengthy and protracted settlement negotiations that went for nearly a year and one-half.  In fact, it \nwas  Defendants’ couns el  who in itially  conceived   of the Prisoners Litigation   Reform  Act \n(PLRA) as a partial defense to a strip search  case.  Although Mr. Greagan’s idea was later co-\nopted by defense counsel in anot her case and presented to Judge  Homer before being raised in \nthis action, (See, Kelsey v. County of Schoharie,  04 Civ. 299 (LEK)(DRH) (N.D.N.Y)), it was \nthis type of creative and smart litigation that caused class counsel to spend much time and labor \nprosecuting this case. \nA(2) The Magnitude and Complexities of the Litigation \n  This litigation lasted over three y ears and involved extensive discovery.  See Docket \nSheet.  Like the Nilsen case, this case involved  significant factual disputes as to whether the  \ncorrections officers actually viewed the arrest ees’ naked bodies while they changed into jail \nclothing. Nilsen, 400 F.Supp.2d at 285.  Also, there was addition al complexity due to the \nindividualized nature of the damages suffered by the plaintiffs and various insurance coverage \nissues that cropped up. Id.  Finally, it is always challenging to represent a class of thousands of \nrelatively disenfranchised, transient individuals with which it is often very difficult to reach and \ncommunicate.   \nA(3) The Risk of the Litigation \n  17\n\nAt the time this action started, Class Counsel  also took considerable risk in prosecuting \nthis action.  Judge Hurd  had not rendered his decision on cla ss certification and the legality of \n“change outs” in Marriott, this District had not decided the a pplication of the PLRA to a strip \nsearch class action, and the Second Circuit had  not yet rectified the E astern District of New \nYork’s denial of class certification in  Augustin v. Jablonsky¸ 99-CV-3126, 2001 WL 770839, at \n*13 (E.D.N.Y. Mar.8, 2001)  For a good portion of the class period, S chenectady County had \nchanged its blanket strip search  policy to one that, at first blush, arguably could have been \nconsidered constitutional (e.g. the “change out”).   In fact, in a recent case, these “change outs” \nwere found not to be in viol ation of the Constitution.  See, Steinberg v. County of Rockland,  04 \nCiv. 4889 (CLB) (S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2005) (bench decision) (Keach Aff., Ex. K).  However, one \nof the determinative factors here was that the County’s 30(b)(6) witness admitted that the policy \nfor a part of the class period was to strip search all admittees and then detailed the use of “change \nouts” during the remainder of the class period.   \nConsidering the credibility jurors often give to law enforcem ent testimony and the fact \nthat it would have been difficult for the plainti ffs to “prove and recover damages for harms that \nwere often dignitary rather than pecuniary,” class counsel faced a substantial risk of nonpayment. \nId.       \nAs noted by the Southern District of New York in a recent class action settlement: \nPlaintiffs’ Class Counsel have received no compensation during the course of this \nlitigation  despite having m ade  a  significant  time  commitment  and incurred  \nsignificant expenses to bring this matter to a successful conclusion for the benefit \nof  the Class.  Any fe e  award or expense reim bursement  to Plaintiffs’ Class \nCounsel has always been contingent on  the result achieved a nd on this Court’s \nexercise  of its discretion in m aking  any awa rd.   Class Counsel undertook a \nsubstantial risk of absolute non-payment in prosecuting this action, for which they \nshould be adequately compensated.   \n \n  18\n\nMaley, 186 F. Supp.2d at 372 (quotations omitted).  See also, City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., \n356 F. Supp. 1380 (S.D.N.Y. 1972),  aff’d in part and rev’d in  part on other grounds,  495 F.2d \n448 (2d Cir. 1974) (“No one expects a lawyer  whose compensation is contingent upon his  \nsuccess to charge, when  successful, as little as  he would charge a client who in advance has \nagreed to pay for his services, regardless of success”).  In short, Class Counsel maintains that the \nrisks associated with difficult civil rights litigation, and the complexities of this action, support \ntheir request for attorneys’ fees, as agreed to in the Settlement Agreement.   \nA(4) The Quality of Representation \nAdditionally, Class Counsel respectfully suggests that the quality of their representation \nof the class supports their request  as well.  “The criti cal element in determining the appropriate \nfee to be awarded class counsel out of a common fund is the result obtained for the Class through \nthe efforts of such counsel.”  Maley, 186 F. Supp.2d at 374.  Here, the monetary results achieved \nfor the class exceed those paid out in other recent strip search class actions, including McBean, \nwhere class members received $750 or $1,000 per claim , and especially  Dodge v. County of \nOrange, where Class Counsel took over half of $1.2 m illion settlement fund as attorneys’ fees  \nand left 18,000 class mem bers with very little  recovery.  The public policy of enforcing the \nnation’s civil rights laws and protecting some of the poorest members of our community from a \npractice  described by one Circuit Court as   being “dem eaning,  dehumanizing,  undignified, \nhumiliating,  terrifying,  unpleasant,  embarrassing,  repulsive, s ignifying  degradation and \nsubmission,” Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983), also strongly \nfavors the requested award of attorneys’ fees.  See, Maley, 186 F. Supp.2d at 373-74.   \nFinally, the reaction of the clas s to the Sett lement also deserves con sideration by the \nCourt.  Despite the Notice Program and healthy  claims rate, not one single claim ant filed an \n  19\n\nobjection to Class Counsel’s request for attorn eys’ fees.  “As was tr ue with the underlying \nsettlement, this overwhelmingly positive response by the Class a ttests to the appr oval of the \nClass with respect to the Settlem ent and the fee and expense application.”   Maley, 186 F. \nSupp.2d at 374.   \nA(5) The Requested Percentage of the Settlement Fund is Fa ir and Reasonable, and is also \nCommensurate with Other Settlements. \nThe Court, in considering the  reasonable percentage of the Settlem ent Fund to award as \nattorneys’ fees, must look to both the percentage of the fund sought and the collective lodestar of \nClass Counsel.  As mentioned above, the twenty-six percent attorneys’ fee negotiated as part of  \nthe Settlement Agreement was bas ed on the recent Dis trict Court ruling in Nilsen..  400 F. \nSupp.2d at 266.  In  Nilsen, District Judge Hornby did what appe ars to be the m ost extensive, \npublished analysis of other strip search settlements and attorneys’ fees, and concluded that, based \non a “market-oriented approach” an appropriate at torneys’ fee in a s trip search class action is \n25%. Id. at 283.  Ack nowledging that a “m ultifactor approach…offers little predictability to \neither the awarding court, or the lawyers w ho seek fee awards,” Judge Hornby applied the \n“market mimicking approach” adopted by the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \nbecause it is “most amenable to predictability” and it “minimizes the difficulty and arbitrariness \nof assessing the reasonableness of a given fee.”  Id., at 276, 278-79.    \nJudge Hornby’s analysis is in accord with case preceden t in this judicial circuit, where \ncourts “have awarded fees ranging from  15% to 50% of the settlem ent fund.”  Maley, 186 F. \nSupp.2d at 370 (awarding 33 1/ 3 % of common fund).   See also, In re Lloyd’s American Trust \nFund Litig., 2002 WL 31663577 (S.D.N.Y. November 26, 2002) (awarding 28% of a $20 million \ncommon fund); Baffa v. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Sec. Co.,  2002 WL 1315603 (S.D.N.Y. \n  20\n\nNovember 26, 2002) (awarding 30 % of a $3 million common fund) ( exhibit N) In re Arakis, \nsupra, (25% of a $24 million common fund);  In re American Bank Note, 127 F.Supp.2d 418 \nS.D.N.Y. 2001) (awarding 25% of $14.85 million fund). In another strip search class action case \nalso handled by class counsel, Marriott v. County of Montgomery, District Judge Hurd awarded \nan attorneys’ fee of 30% of the $2.0 million settlement fund.7  The Court should also consider, \nwhen awarding an appropriate percentage, the extensive injunctive relief achieved by Class \nCounsel in the Settlement Agreement.  E.g. Wal-Mart Stores, 396 F.3d at 121. \nAs  the Court is undoubtedly aware, the provi sion  of attorneys’ fees in the settlem ent \nagreement,  just like ev ery  other  issue in this   case, was   hotly  contested and aggressively \nnegotiated. The parties finally agreed on the  percentage fee based on a discussion of the  Nilsen \ndecision, with an additional percentage added to compensate for litigation costs.  The Defendants \nagreed to the payment of this fee, and also agreed not to oppose Class Counsel’s application for \nattorneys’ fees.  See, Settlement Agreement.      \n  In considering a percentage attorney fee in a class action, the Court must also consider a \n“’cross-check’ to a percentage award,” which involves taking Class Counsel’s collective lodestar \nand dividing it into the proposed fund, which yields the “mulitipier.”  Wal-Mart Stores, 396 F.3d \nat 123, n. 27.  Here, considering the approxim ate hourly attorneys’ fees to date, class counsel \nseeks a modest multiplier of approximately 2.3, depending on the total size of counsel’s lodestar \nat the time of final approval.  This is well w ithin the range of reasonableness for a class action  \n                                                 \n7    Class Counsel acknowledges that Judge McAvoy awarded a much smaller percentage of the Settlement Fund in \nKahler v. County of Rensselaer than that requested here.  The Kahler Settlement Fund was $2.7 million, with a \nreversionary interest to the County in the event the Fund was not exhausted after class members were awarded \n$1,000 per claim.  Judge McAvoy awarded class counsel their lodestar at prevailing rates for each attorney’s home \njurisdiction, $370,000, or approximately 13.7% of the Settlement Fund.  The Nilsen case mistakenly evaluates the \nsettlement in Kahler, and presents the percentage of attorneys’ fees paid as much  higher than it actually was \nbecause it mistakenly included $73,000 in reimbursed expenses and administrative costs, allowed under Judge \nMcAvoy’s Final Approval Order, in its report on the total attorneys’ fees paid in the Kahler settlement.  \n     Judge McAvoy did not award any multiplier in the Kahler action.  Class counsel did not appeal Judge McAvoy’s \nattorneys’ fees ruling because it would have delayed distribution of settlement payments to class members.   \n  21\n\nsettlement.  In Wal-Mart, the Second Circuit approved a multiplier of 3.5.  Other Courts have  \napproved multipliers far in excess of the one sought here by class couns el.  See, In Re NASDAQ \nMarket-Makers Antitrust Litig., 187 F.R.D. 465, 489 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (court awarded multiplier \nof 3.97, noting that “[i]n recent years multipliers of between 3 and 4.5 have becom e common); \nMaley, 186 F. Supp.2d at 371 (awarding a “m odest” multiplier of 4.65).  Judge Hurd’s final \napproval of $600,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs (like here, the amount agreed to by the parties) \namounted to a multiplier of 1.4 in Marriott v. County of Montgomery. \n  Class  Counsel respectf ully  suggests to the  Court  that the counsel fee requested is \nreasonable in light of the extensive tim e and labor expended by counsel, the m agnitude of the \nlitigation, the risks taken in the litigation, the  monetary results achieved for the class, and the  \namount of the fee in proportion to the m onetary settlement and injunctive relief achieved.  Class \nCounsel now requests that the Court approve the requested fee. \nPOINT III \nTHE INCENTIVE AWARDS TO LESSIE DAVIES AND WILLIAM SMITH \nSHOULD BE APPROVED \n \n  The Settlement Agreement provides for incentive awards for Class Representative Lessie \nDavies of $12,000, and an additional payment for William Smith of $1,500 above his pro rata \nshare of the Settlement Fund.  Class Counsel maintains that Lessie Davies provided substantial \nsupport to this litigation by serving as the Class Representative, and fulfilling her commitments \nin that regard.  This action initially had two Class Representatives, one of whom, Nichole \nMcDaniel, abdicated her responsibilities to the Class and failed, repeatedly, to appear for her \ndeposition.  While Lessie Davies left the area to live in the Bronx, she took her responsibilities to \nthe Class seriously, stayed in touch with Class Counsel and, despite living in a homeless shelter \nin New York City at the time, appeared as scheduled to be deposed by the Defendants.  Had Miss \n  22\n\nDavies not fulfilled her responsibilities to the Class, this action may well have had a different \noutcome.  Additionally, William Smith agreed to serve as a class representative in 2005, and \nprovided Class Counsel with assistance in locating and speaking to members of the Class.  While \nMr. Smith’s intervention was eventually unnecessary because of the efforts to resolve this action, \nClass Counsel maintains that he is entitled to a modest incentive payment for his assistance.   \n  The awards to these individuals are reasonable and should be approved.  The law \nrecognizes that it is appropriate to make modest awards in the range of $1,000 to $20,000 in \nrecognition of the services that such plaintiffs perform in a successful class action.  See, Roberts \nv. Texaco, 979 F. Supp. 185, 205 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); Genden v. Merrill Lynch, 700 F. Supp. 208, \n210 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (granting incentive awards of $20,085 for each class representative).  Class \nCounsel respectfully requests that these incentive awards be approved.   \nV.  Conclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s motion for final approval of the class action \nsettlement should be granted in its entirety.  \n \nBeranbaum Menken Ben-Asher & Bierman LLP \n      By:  __________/s/_____________________ \n            Jason J.
