    "summary": "<p>On April 29, 2003, a woman represented by a group of private attorneys from New York and D.C. law firms filed a class action suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, alleging that the Clinton County Sheriff's Department  had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all individuals who entered the Clinton County Jail, regardless of the crime for which they were charged and without reasonable suspicion that the individuals were concealing weapons or contraband.  Plaintiff alleged that the unconstitutional strip searches were conducted pursuant to a written policy up to October 24, 2003.  Plaintiff further alleged that while the County's written policy was revised on October 24, 2003, corrections officers ignored the revised policy and continued to carry out the practice of blanket strip searches.  Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary and punitive damages, and class certification.  Defendants, the County and the Sheriff, answered by generally denying all allegations. </p><p>Extensive discovery and litigation followed.</p><p>On July 5, 2007, the District Court certified the case as a class action.  The class consisted of all persons in either of two subclasses, A or B, who were placed into the custody of the Clinton County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry into the Clinton County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Clinton County Sheriff's Department and the County of Clinton.  Class A included those strip searched between February 28, 2003 and October 24, 2003, while Class B included those strip searched between October 24, 2003 and the date on which the Clinton County Sheriff's Department and/or the County of Clinton ceased, or was enjoined from, enforcing their unconstitutional policy.  Mitchell v. County of Clinton, 2007 WL 1988716 (N.D. N.Y. July 05, 2007).  A representative plaintiff was approved for class A and plaintiffs were granted leave, over defendants' objection, to name a representative plaintiff for class B. Mitchell v. County of Clinton, 2008 WL 85092 (N.D. N.Y. Jan. 07, 2008).</p><p>On October 8, 2008, the parties reached a settlement agreement. Under the terms of the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay $1.15 million to the estimated 2,700 potential members of the plaintiff class.  </p><p>On December 4, 2009, Magistrate Judge David R. Homer released a final order granting approval of the class action settlement for all members of the class who did not opt out of the settlement. In addition, the representative member of each of the two subclasses received specific amounts of compensation, with $25,000 for the representative of Class A and $10,000 for the representative of Class B. The plaintiffs were also granted $324,730.93 in attorney's fees. The case is now closed.</p>",

INTRODUCTION\nArrested on minor charges and under circumstances not suggestive of reasonable suspicion,\nthe plaintiff, Phyllis A. Mitchell (“Mitchell” or “Plaintiff”), was nonetheless strip searched upon her\nentry to the Clinton County Jail (“CCJ”), in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution and the clearly-established caselaw in this judicial circuit.  Plaintiff alleges, and\ntestimony from the Defendants and their employees confirms, that she endured this unconstitutional\nsearch because of Defendant Clinton County’s policy and practice of strip searching every pre-trial\ndetainee who entered the CCJ, without regard to the presence or absence of reasonable suspicion that\nsuch detainees were secreting contraband.  Accordingly, numerous other similarly situated Clinton\nCounty pre-trial detainees suffered the same constitutional breach and traumatic experience.  To put\na stop to this unconstitutional practice and to obtain compensation for herself and all others similarly\nsituated, the Plaintiff filed the within lawsuit on February 28, 2006 seeking declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, class certification, monetary damages, and counsel fees.  (Exhibit A).  \nThe class action device, as provided under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, was\ndesignated for the exact situation presented to this Court – it provides a means of redress for many\nwho would not have otherwise come forward to address the violation of their rights because of the\nexpense and difficulties of individual litigation.  Plaintiff satisfies the general requirements for\ncertification of a class action, and furthermore will demonstrate to this Court the entitlement to\ncertification of a damages class.  Other federal courts, considering the exact situation presented to\nthe Court in this motion, have not hesitated to certify class actions where police departments and\nlocal correctional facilities have applied a blanket strip search policy to pre-trial detainees.  Plaintiff\nrespectfully suggests that certification of this action as a class action is appropriate given case\nprecedent, and given the facts underlying this lawsuit.  \n1\n\nII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS\nA. Phyllis Mitchell’s Arrest and Strip Search\nPhyllis Mitchell is a 47 year old mother of six children, and has worked as a radiographer\nfor the past fourteen years.  (Exhibit B, 8:11-17)1.  On March 27, 2003, Ms. Mitchell was arrested\nand placed in the Clinton County Jail on charges of Abandonment of Animals, Failure to Provide\nProper Sustenance (two counts), and Failure to Provide Proper Food and Drink (to animals), all\nmisdemeanors under New York’s Agricultural and Markets law.  (Exhibit B, 14:6-24; exhibit C).\nMs. Mitchell testified that, shortly after her arrival at the CCJ, she was moved into a room\nwith lockers on the wall and directed to remove all of her clothing, including her brassiere and\nunderpants.  (Exhibit B, 48:5-11, 56:18-20, 58:16-21).  The correction officer who performed the\nstrip search, Stephanie LaTulipe, testified and confirmed Ms. Mitchell’s account.  (Exhibit D, 38:15-\n17, 39:5-9).  Ms. Mitchell was also directed to remove the adult diaper she wore as a result of a\nbladder control condition (exhibit B, 53:14-17, 59 5-7), an occurrence unusual enough to give\nOfficer LaTulipe a specific, unrefreshed recollection of Ms. Mitchell’s strip search.  (Exhibit D,\n35:24-37:20, 39:12-22).  While naked, Ms. Mitchell was instructed to “lift her breasts [and]\ncompletely strip naked and squat” to allow for a visual inspection of her vaginal and anal cavities.\nExhibit B, 58:16-21; exhibit D, 41:8-17.  \nOfficer LaTulipe strip searched Ms. Mitchell, just as she strip searched every arriving pre-\ntrial detainee, in order to ensure that she did not possess any contraband.  (Id., 31:22-24).  However,\nLatulipe acknowledged that she had no reason to believe that Ms. Mitchell was concealing weapons\nor contraband (id., 45:5-16), and no such contraband was found on Ms. Mitchell.  (Id., 42:23-24).\nThe reason Ms. Mitchell was subjected to this humiliating procedure is undisputed, since the County\n1 All citations to deposition testimony herein will be in the format page number:line number.  \n2\n\nof Clinton and its correctional officers testified that at the time of Ms. Mitchell’s booking,\nDefendants had an unconstitutional policy of strip searching every pre-trial detainee who entered\nthe CCJ.  \nB.  The County’s Blanket Strip Search Policy \n1.  Three CCJ Corrections Officers Testified There Was Such A Policy\nThree correctional officers who were responsible for booking new detainees into the CCJ\ntestified that there was indeed policy of strip searching each arriving detainee.  Latulipe testified that\nshe began working at the CCJ in 1992 (exhibit D, 16:8-12) and was assigned to booking within 6\nto 12 months of her arrival.  (Id., 16:23–17:1).  At that time, arriving detainees were brought into\nthe intake office, where booking paperwork was completed, and the detainee was permitted a\ntelephone call.  The inmate would be pat-searched during this part of the procedure.  (Id., 28:19-\n29:4).  The detainee was then brought to a room known as the inmate locker room.  (Id., 26:8-\n27:10).  There, the detainee would be directed to remove all of her clothing, and while naked, lift\nher breasts and feet for inspection, open her mouth for inspection, and squat down and cough.  (Id.,\n31:4-14).  The officer would be standing in front of the detainee, observing her throughout the entire\nstrip search (id., 31:15-21), and would search the detainee’s clothing once it was removed.  (Id.,\n32:15-16).  Officer Latulipe followed this procedure for every detainee she booked into the facility\nduring the 2002-2003 time period.  (Id., 33:6-9).  The purpose of this strip search was to prevent the\nintroduction of contraband into the facility. (Id., 31:22-24).  However, she never found contraband\non an arriving inmate during the time she admitted using this procedure.  (Id., 43:1-4).  \nMichael Galarneau testified that he has been a CCJ correction officer since approximately\n2001.  (Exhibit E, 6:9-11).  He was first assigned to booking prior to 2003, and during that time\nperiod worked booking as a fill in between once a week and once a month.  (Id., 10:10-11:4).\n3\n\nGalarneau testified, just as Latulipe did, that arriving detainees are pat frisked, and then asked\nquestions in order to fill out booking paperwork.  (Id., 12:3-24).  The booking officer then takes a\nphotograph of the detainee (Id, 13:2-4).  Following the photograph, the detainee would be taken into\nthe inmate locker room, where the correction officer would direct the detainee to remove all of his\nclothing, and while naked bend over and spread the lobes of his buttocks, lift his arms, open his\nmouth, and run his fingers through his hair.  (Id., 13:18-15:14).  \nMichael Clukey testimony was consistent with Latulipe’s and Galarneau’s.  Clukey first\nstarted work in the intake area prior to 2003 (exhibit F, 10:3-19).  He testified that, prior to October\nof 2003, each arriving pre-trial detainee was taken into the locker room, after the booking paperwork\nwas filled out, and strip searched.  (Id., 14:11-15:3).  Each detainee was required, while naked, to\nraise his hands, run his fingers through his hair, lift his testicles, raise the bottoms of his feet, and\nbend over.  (Id., 15:4-10).  The clothing that the detainee removed was also searched by the officer.\n(Id., 57:9-11).  This procedure was followed for each detainee, regardless of the criminal charge and\nregardless of whether Officer Clukey believed the detainee was hiding contraband.  (Id., 15:11-\n16:1).  Clukey was taught to follow this procedure when he was hired in 1996.  (Id., 16:8-17).  The\npurpose of the strip search was to prevent the introduction of contraband into the facility (id., 57:4-\n6), but Clukey testified that he had never found contraband on a detainee as the result of performing\na strip search.  (Id., 56:22-24).  \n2.  The CCJ Written Intake Policy Was Also Unconstitutional\nBefore October 2003, the intake searches at the CCJ were governed by two written policies:\nPolicy  No.  C-102,  “Implementing  and  Maintaining  the  Admissions  Process”  (exhibit  G),\n(“admissions policy”) and Policy No. D-221, “Strip Search Procedures” (exhibit H) (“strip search\npolicy”).  The admissions policy provides that a “miscellaneous officer” is responsible for strip\n4\n\nsearching and issuing jail clothing to inmates, but does not provide instruction on how the search\nis to be done, nor does the policy state that a strip search on intake may only be done if supported\nby reasonable suspicion.  (Exhibit G at 6).  \nThe strip search policy states that only “certain inmates” will be searched at the time of\nadmission, based on reasonable suspicion.  (Exhibit H, p. 1).  However, the policy goes on to define\n“reasonable suspicion” in a rigid way that both removes all discretion from the search officer as to\nwho to strip search, and prevents consideration of the particular, individual circumstances of each\ndetainee.  A “reasonable suspicion” chart lists fifteen factors, the presence of any one of which will\nlead to a strip search.  The chart provides, among other things, that any detainee charged (either in\nthe present or the past) with any offense involving violence or illegal drugs will be strip searched\nupon admission.  Any detainee who was intoxicated upon arrival would also be strip searched.  (Id.,\np. 1-2).  The strip search policy also contains a “Table of Strip Searchable Penal Law Offenses,”\nwhich provides that arriving detainees charged with certain offenses will be automatically strip\nsearched.  Included in that table are the misdemeanor charges of third-degree assault; third degree\nmenacing, second degree unlawful imprisonment, criminal possession of a controlled substance in\nthe seventh degree, and the violations of unlawful possession of marijuana and disorderly conduct.\n(Id., p. 5).  Michael Smith, the CCJ Administrator and the County of Clinton’s deponent pursuant\nto F.R.C.P. 30(b)(6), testified that the list of reasonable suspicion factors provided “the reasoning\nto conduct some strip searches at that time.”  (Exhibit I, 82:17-20).  \nGiven the breadth of the written policy, and the large percentage of arriving detainees who\nwould be automatically strip searched under its terms, it is perhaps not surprising that the correction\nofficers testified that they were completely unfamiliar with the written policy, and did not refer to\nit in conducting the blanket strip search policy.  Officer Galarneau testified that he had only\n5\n\nskimmed the written policies when he was first hired (exhibit E, 34:1-8) and could not recall having\nseen the strip search policy before it was shown to him at his deposition.  (Id., 37:14-19).  Officer\nClukey had not looked at the policy manual since the time he was hired approximately 10 years ago\n(exhibit F, 18:4-7, 7:7-8) and was not familiar with the “Table of Strip Searchable Offenses” (id.,\n19:3-17).  Latulipe also had never seen the strip search policy prior to her deposition.  (Exhibit D,\n25:16-23).  \nC. The Alleged October 2003 Change in Policy\nOn October 24, 2003, Major Smith wrote a memorandum purporting to revise the inmate\nstrip search policy.  (Exhibit J).  This memo stated in part as follows:  \nDue to a recent Court decision… regarding inmate strip searches the following is\neffective immediately.  The Clinton County jail shall not maintain a “blanket” strip\nsearch  policy  regarding  newly  admitted  inmates.    All  newly-arrived  pre-trial\n(unsentenced) detainees upon their initial admission to the jail shall not be strip\nsearched unless the officer has a “reasonable suspicion” that the inmate is concealing\nweapons or other contraband. The decision to strip search shall not be based upon\nany one factor such as crime committed or degree.  Officers shall base their decision\non several factors such as crime charged, particular characteristics of the arrestee,\nand/or the circumstances of the arrest…  This memorandum supersedes current\nDepartment Policy regarding any provisions defining when newly admitted inmates\nmay be strip searched.\nSee also exhibit I, 72:18-74:16.2  Major Smith testified that corrections officers were not provided\nwith copies of the memorandum, but that it was read aloud at pre-shift briefings.  (Id., 74:20-75:6).\nNo follow-up training or instruction was given.  (Id., 75:18-22). Officer Clukey confirmed that he\ndid not receive a copy of this memorandum, but only heard about it from his sergeants (exhibit F,\n37:5-10).  \nHowever, it is clear from the testimony of the corrections officers that the October 23, 2003\n2 Major Smith testified that the memo merely confirmed old Jail policy inasmuch as blanket strip searches were\nimpermissible.  The testimony of Clinton County Jail correctional officers supra, severely discredits this testimony.  \n6\n\nmemorandum did not mark the end of the CCJ’s unconstitutional strip search policy.  First of all,\nthe memo was not effective at changing the attitudes of the CCJ correction officers.  Latulipe\ntestified that fellow officers disagreed with the memo, and that “it’s hard for people to take change.”\n(Exhibit D, 77:6-14).  This change was undoubtedly made more difficult by the lack of any follow-\nup instruction.   In addition, little about the booking process seemed to change immediately after the\nmemo.  Arriving detainees were still changed into their jail uniform in the inmate locker room.\nThere was no curtain or other provision for inmate privacy in place at that time.  (Exhibit E, 21:1-2;\nexhibit F, 24:18-22, 22:11-16).  Officer Galarneau testified that at that time he would stand in the\ndoorway and observe the detainee as they changed into their jail uniform, in order to prevent the\nintroduction of contraband into the facility.  (Exhibit E, 20:22-21:16, 24:17-25:3, 26:10-18).3  For\nher part, LaTulipe testified that the intake officer could observe the detainees while they were\nchanging if they chose to.  (Exhibit D, 93:22-24).4  Clothing changes were later done in a hallway\nnear the sallyport (exhibit E, 23:15-24) and in an officer’s bathroom (id., 25:4-24, exhibit F, 30:21-\n23).  Neither of those locations contained a curtain for privacy during the clothing change.  (Id.,\n22:11-16, 30:24-31:2; exhibit E, 21:1-2, 26:1-4; exhibit D, 103:17-21).  \nSignificantly, the written policies governing admissions and strip searches were not revised\nuntil several years later, and were not made available to correctional officers until January of 2006.\n(Exhibit I, 113:23-25).  Until that time, the prior, unconstitutional policies remained in effect.  (Id.,\n114:1-10).  The revised policies, on their face, appear to be  constitutional.  (Exhibits K and L).  \nAccording to Major Smith, from February 28, 2003 through the present, inmates were\npermitted to change from their street clothing into a jail uniform in private.  Exhibit I, 116:4-8.\n3 Clukey did not admit observing the detainees changing, but testified he would stand in the doorway and not\nobserve the detainee.  (Exhibit F, 25:5-11).  \n4 Officer LaTulipe stated that she did not chose to watch inmates change because the October 24, 2003 memo stated\nthat probable cause was required to strip search a newly admitted inmate.  (Exhibit D, 94:6-11).  \n7\n\nHowever, as shown supra this testimony is discredited by the testimony of Officers Latulipe,\nGalarneau and Clukey, who confirm that before Major Smith’s October 24, 2003 memo, the County\nof Clinton conducted blanket strip and visual cavity searches on all new detainees admitted to the\nCCJ.  In short, at least for eight months of the class period, even the County’s employees agree that\neach and every individual admitted to the Clinton County Jail was forced to undergo a strip search,\nincluding a visual examination of their body cavities.  \nIII.  ARGUMENT\nTHIS COURT SHOULD CERTIFY THIS ACTION, ON EITHER A FULL \nOR PARTIAL BASIS, AS A CLASS ACTION\nPhyllis Mitchell seeks to represent a class of thousands of individuals, many of whom are\npoor and disenfranchised, who had (and who will have) their civil rights unnecessarily violated by\nthe uniform strip search practices of Clinton County.  Having obtained compelling documentary and\ntestimonial proof, Plaintiff now moves for certification of the following two subclasses:\nClass (a)\nAll persons who were placed into the custody of the Clinton County\nJail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of\nprobation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other\nminor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry into the\nClinton County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the\nClinton County Sheriff’s Department and the County of Clinton, from\nFebruary 28, 2003 until October 24, 2003.  Specifically excluded\nfrom the class are Defendants and any and all of their respective\naffiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or\nassignees.  \nClass (b)\nAll persons who were placed into the custody of the Clinton County\nJail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of\nprobation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other\nminor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry into the\n8\n\nClinton County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the\nClinton County Sheriff’s Department and the County of Clinton, from\nOctober 24, 2003 through the date on which the Clinton County\nSheriff’s Department and/or the County of Clinton cease or ceased,\nor are enjoined from, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice\nand custom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion.\nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all\nof their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors,\nemployees or assignees.  \nFor the ease of manageability, each of the two subclasses should be certified, for different\nfactual disputes exist as to each of the time periods set forth above.  The evidence is clear that from\nFebruary 28, 2003 until October 24, 2003, before Major Smith’s memo, the County engaged in a\npolicy of strip searching all inmates.  A separate class should be certified for the period after\nOctober 24, 2003.  \nThe Court may certify a case for class action treatment where the plaintiff can demonstrate\nthat the threshold requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) (numerosity, commonality, typicality and\nadequacy of representation) are satisfied, and that the class satisfies one of the three criteria set forth\nin Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)5.  Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 375-76 (2d Cir. 1997).  Here,\nPlaintiff easily satisfies each these threshold requirements and requests that the Court certify this\naction as a money damages class under Fed. R. Civ. P 23(b)(3), or, in the alternative, as an\ninjunctive relief class action under 23(b)(2).  Should the Court find that full certification is not\nappropriate, Plaintiff requests partial certification relative to the issues common to the class: the\nexistence of a blanket strip search policy at the Clinton County Correctional Facility and the liability\nof Clinton County for that policy.\nAs will be outlined more thoroughly below, numerous federal courts in at least seven\n5 The Second Circuit in In re IPO Litig., 471 F.3d 24 (2d Cir. 2006) clarified the standards for certifying a class\naction, holding that a court must be satisfied that the factual basis for each of the Rule 23 factors has been met. \nGiven that the Plaintiff has developed compelling evidence not just in support of the Rule 23 factors, but the merits\nof her claim, In re IPO is no impediment to class certification in this case.  \n9\n\ncircuits, when considering situations where municipalities employ blanket strip search policies, have\nnot hesitated to certify those actions as class actions.12    \nA. The Proposed Class Satisfies the Numerosity Requirement of Rule 23(a)(1).\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be “so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable.”  Plaintiff is not required to detail, to the person, the exact size of the class or\ndemonstrate that joinder of all class members is impossible.  Robideaux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935\n(2d Cir. 1993) (“[i]mpracticable does not mean impossible”); Civic Ass’n of Deaf v. Giuliani, 915\nF. Supp. 622, 632 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (“precise quantification of the class members is not necessary\nbecause the court may make ‘common sense assumptions’ to support a finding of numerosity”)\n(internal citations omitted).  Instead, Plaintiff need only provide the Court with a reasonable estimate\nas to the size of the class.  McLean v. Merrifield, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12753, *17 (W.D.N.Y.\nJune 28, 2002). \nHere, Smith testified that there were approximately 1300-1400 bookings a year into the CCJ,\nof which about half were misdemeanors.  (Exhibit I, 12:9-20, 19:8-10).  This would give a class size\nof approximately 900 individuals for the first subclass, and many times that number for the second,\ndepending upon what date was found after trial to be the date the unconstitutional policy ceased.\nNumerosity is therefore satisfied.  Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483\n(2nd Cir. 1995) (“Where the proposed class consists of at least forty members … the numerosity\n12 First Circuit: Tardiff v.

Supp. 2d. 342 (D. D.C.\n2005).\n10\n\nrequirement is presumed to be satisfied”).\n B. There are Numerous Questions of Law and Fact Common to the Class.\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the class.”  “The\ncommonality requirement is met if plaintiffs’ grievances share a common question of law or of\nfact.”  Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 376.  Plaintiff is not required to show that all class members’ claims\nare identical to each other, and any differences between the proposed class members, “while\narguably relevant as defenses to liability, do not change the fact that this class action raises the same\nbasic claim and shares common questions of law.”  Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 22-23 (allowing\ncertification of strip search class action despite “varying defenses to liability which may be raised\nregarding particular individuals”); Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 269 F. Supp. 2d 159, 189\n(W.D.N.Y. 2003) (noting that Rule 23, “does not require that every issue in the case be similar to\nevery other issue presented by each class member’s case … the court’s inquiry is directed primarily\nto  class  wide  questions  of  liability”);  LaFlamme,  212  F.R.D.  448,  453  (N.D.N.Y.  2003)\n(“commonality is not precluded by the possibility that the proof required to demonstrate injury\nmight be highly individualized”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, a single common\nquestion is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).  See generally In Re Agent Orange\nProd. Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d 145 (2d Cir. 1987).  A party is entitled to certification where the class\nclaims arise “from a common nucleus of operative facts regardless of whether the underlying facts\nfluctuate over the class period and vary as to individual claimants.”  Haywood, 109 F.R.D. 568, 577\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \nHere, Plaintiff has satisfied the requirements of commonality.  The central focus of Ms.\nMitchell’s claims against Clinton County are that both she and all members of the proposed classes\nwere illegally strip searched upon their entry into the CCJ, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n11\n\nPlaintiff has offered compelling evidence, including correction officer testimony, that all individuals\nadmitted to the Jail were, subjected to the visual inspection of their naked bodies upon admission.\nMs. Mitchell for her part testified that she was subjected to this procedure upon admission to the\nCCJ.  \nThere is some evidence, from the correction officer’s testimony, that at some time after\nOctober 24, 2003, the intake strip search of pre-trial detainees evolved from a full-blown strip search\nwith inspection of the body’s cavities to the observation of the detainee while changing clothes.\nSuch a procedure is nevertheless unconstitutional.  The visual inspection by a corrections officer of\na naked, pre-trial detainee is a strip search which must be supported by individualized, reasonable\nsuspicion:\nAlthough strip searches often may involve additional steps, we\ndecline to draw the line so narrowly that standing naked for inspec-\ntion by officers falls short of being a strip search if unaccompanied\nby a demand to open one’s mouth or lift one’s arms.  Unquestionably,\nthe serious intrusion stems from exposing one’s naked body to officer\nscrutiny; the impact of that forced nudity is undervalued if focused\nattention on the mouth and underarms is also required to reach the\nthreshold of a strip search.  \nWood v. Hancock County Sheriff’s Department, 354 F.3d 57, 63 (1st Cir. 2003); see also\nOwens v. County of Del., Civ. A. No. 95-4282, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17098, *58, n. 22 (E.D. Pa.\nAug. 15, 1996) (“The [Tenth Circuit] held that because plaintiff was thus ‘forced to disrobe, we\nconsider this to be a strip search.  We do not think it necessary to distinguish between searches of\nthis type and visual body cavity searches.  The standard adopted is applicable to all strip searches.’\nSimilarly, here, [where plaintiff was allowed to remain in underwear], I regard the search performed\non plaintiff as a strip search.”); Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, 141 F. Supp.2d 304, 308 (N.D.\nN.Y. 2001) (requiring reasonable suspicion for search of a woman who claimed officers “required\n12\n\nher to lower her pants (but not her underwear) and raise her shirt (but not take off her bra)); Lopez\nv. City of New York, 901 F. Supp. 684 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (rejecting defendants’ argument “that\nsearches that stop short of complete nakedness are reasonable per se,” court applied Fourth\nAmendment reasonableness test to allegations that plaintiffs were asked to remove clothing and\nwere touched by officers, but were not naked at any point); Mason v. Village of Babylon, 124 F.\nSupp. 2d 807, 811 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (court found that search where plaintiff was “asked to lift her\nshirt, lower her pants and, as put by the County ‘rearrange her undergarments’” violated the Fourth\nAmendment); Huck v. City of Newburgh, 275 A.D. 2d 343, 712 N.Y.S. 2d 149 (App. Div. 2000)\n(applying Weber reasonable suspicion analysis where plaintiff “asked to remove all her outer\ngarments, and while her underwear was still on, she was asked to lift her bra and expose her\nbreasts”); Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159, 169 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (“admitees are\nrequired to strip naked in front of a CO and submit to the observation of their body by the CO.  This\nprocedure squarely fits both the common and legal definitions of strip search.”)  \nAs such, this class action has two common issues that are of central importance to members\nof each of the proposed subclasses: a) did the Clinton County Jail employ a suspicionless strip\nsearch policy and/or practice during the class period; and b) are Clinton County and the remaining\ndefendants responsible for these constitutional violations.  Class members in the post-October 2003\nsubclass also share the common question of when and if the unconstitutional policy came to an end.\nMoreover, the evidence illustrates that Defendants had a policy – either written or a de facto practice\n– of strip searching (including a visual cavity search) everyone admitted to the Jail at least as of\nFebruary 28, 2003, and that Plaintiff and the putative class members were in fact strip searched by\nDefendants during this time frame.  Commonality is, accordingly, satisfied.  Marriot, 227 F.R.D.\nat 172.  \n13\n\nClass certification is appropriate given these common questions, regardless of whether subtle\nvariations in circumstances amongst individual class members exist.  Eddleman v. Jefferson County,\n1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 25298, *12-13 (6th Cir. Aug. 29, 1996) (commonality is present even where\nsome class members were “subject to a full strip search instead of a partial one, or the fact that some\nindividuals may fail to meet the qualifications for the class because it can be shown that there was\nreasonable suspicion to search them[;] ... isolated instances of non-commonality are not grounds for\ndenying class certification”); Blihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 616 (certifying strip search class action where\n“department policy suggests that some arrestees were visually inspected while others were searched\nmore intrusively”).\nDefendants may claim that factual disputes (for at least part of the proposed class period)\nabout whether there was in fact a blanket strip search policy at the CCJ precludes class certification\nbecause of the IPO decision.  However, IPO does not require the Court to resolve this factual\ndispute (if it exists) at this time.  What the IPO decision requires before a class may be certified,\nrather, is that the Plaintiff show that the proposed class shares a common question of law or fact, \nnot that the common question must be resolved in favor of the class.  Adjudicating this issue would\nbe to go beyond that which is necessary to the Rule 23 analysis, which is not to be done at the class\ncertification stage.  See IPO, supra at 41 (“in making such determinations, a district judge should\nnot assess any aspect of the merits unrelated to a Rule 23 requirement.”) What matters is the\nexistence of the common issue, not its resolution.  The First Circuit held as much in a similar case:\nIn this case, whether there was a rule, policy or custom of automatically strip\nsearching all or most categories of arrestees is on its face a common disputed issue--\nas both sides concede.  Nothing here obliged the district courts to do more than view\nthe issue as such and, so viewed, it weighs in favor of class action status.  \nTardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).  Thus, because the disputed question of the\n14\n\nexistence of a blanket strip search policy (de facto or otherwise) is nothing more than a common\npredicate to liability for all putative class members and not a requirement of FRCP 23, under IPO\nthe Court cannot and should not resolve any merits dispute on this issue. \nPlaintiffs have submitted ample evidence to support a reasonable jury’s conclusion that the\ndefendants had a de facto policy to strip search everyone admitted to the CCJ.  The totality of the\nevidence clearly permits a rational fact-finder to conclude that the defendants had a de facto policy -\nindeed, an actual practice - of strip searching every new admittee to the Holding Center.  The\nevidence submitted to the Court thus illustrates that all of the requirements of FRCP 23 are satisfied\nin accordance with IPO.    Should the Court have doubts about who to believe and which testimony\nto credit among the documentary evidence submitted, it bears noting that IPO did nothing to alter\nthe long-existing practice and precedent that courts “should resolve all doubts about whether a class\nshould be created in favor of certification.”  Pyke v. Cuomo, 209 F.R.D. 33, 41 (N.D.N.Y. 2002);\nsee also Green v. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291, 298 (2d Cir. 1968).\nUnder circumstances such as these, where all class members raise common questions of law\nand assert the same claims as a result of the same unlawful strip search policy, the element of\ncommonality has clearly been established.\nC. The Claims of the Representative Plaintiff are Typical of the Claims of the \nClass at Large.    \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the representative plaintiff’s claims be “typical” of those of the\nother class members.  “The commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.”\nGen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157, n. 13 (1982).  The typicality\nrequirement “is satisfied when each class member’s claim arises from the same course of events,\nand each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant’s liability.”  Marisol\n15\n\nA., 126 F.3d at 376.  “Factual differences will not prevent class certification where the claims arise\nfrom a common legal theory,” and the fact that class members may have differing defenses is of no\nimport; – “the position that typicality is not satisfied with respect to defenses faced by class\nmembers is untenable.”  LaFlamme, 212 F.R.D. at 454 (internal quotations and citations omitted);\nsee also Blihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 617 (applying this principle to a strip search class action).  A class\nrepresentative should “have the incentive to prove all of the elements of the cause of action which\nwould be presented by the individual members of the class were they initiating individual actions.”\nDietrich v. Bauer, 192 F.R.D. 119, 124 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (internal quotations marks and citations\nomitted).  \nHere, Mitchell’s claims are typical of members of the proposed class.  They arise from the\nsame course of events and Mitchell must make similar arguments to prosecute her claims as would\nbe made by members of the proposed class.  Typicality is satisfied because the class representative\nalleges similar circumstances regarding her wrongful strip searches.  \nD.  Plaintiff and Her Counsel Will Fairly and Adequately Represent the Class.\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the class representative “fairly and adequately protect the interests\nof the class.”  Adequate representation depends on two factors: (a) the plaintiff’s attorney must be\nqualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation; and (b) the class\nmembers, and especially the representative party, must not have interests antagonistic to one\nanother.  In re Joint Eastern and Southern Dist. Asbestos Litigation, 78 F.3d 764, 778 (2d. Cir.\n1996).  Both prerequisites of adequacy of representation are met in the instant case.\nMs. Mitchell seeks to bring an end to the illegal strip searches at the CCJ and is further\ncommitted to obtaining appropriate compensation from Defendants for both herself and members\nof the proposed class.  Ms. Mitchell has come forward to represent the class despite great personal\n16\n\npressure and pain – being subjected to a situation as humiliating as a strip search and then being\nforced to relive it would be difficult for anyone.  Her interest in stopping the Defendants’\nunconstitutional practice, and in obtaining compensation, is identical to that of the putative class\nmembers.  Accordingly, there is no antagonism or conflict presented in appointing Phyllis Mitchell\nas the class representative.  Indeed, in nearly identical circumstances, and given the common legal\nand factual issues, courts have deemed plaintiffs in similar cases to be adequate class representa-\ntives.  See, e.g., Marriott, supra at 172.   \nThe class is also represented by competent and experienced counsel who have invested\nconsiderable time and resources into the prosecution of this action, and have gathered compelling\nevidence regarding the systematic strip search practices carried our over a period of time in Erie\nCounty.  Attorney Bob Keach has litigated a number of federal civil rights cases before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of New York,6 and has also served as lead, local or co-\ncounsel in several class actions including: Hytten v. Volkswagen of America (Sup. Ct., Otsego Co.)\n(National settlement of warranty fraud litigation); Kelsey v. County of Schoharie, No. 04-CV-1324\n(LEK/DRH) (strip search class action regarding Schoharie County Correctional Facility, co-counsel\nwith present Class Counsel); Wies v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., No. 00-CV-1242 (TJM/DRH)\n(defective firestone tires, later transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation to the\nSouthern District of Indiana); and Frank v. Goodyear Tire Rubber Co., No. 02-CV 0985 (LEK/RFT)\n(transferred by Judge Kahn to the District of New Jersey to facilitate settlement).\nJonathan W. Cuneo and Charles J. LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, have extensive\nexperience in state and federal trial and appellate courts, before law enforcement authorities and in\n6 See Curry v. City of Syracuse, 316 F.3d 324 (2d Cir. 2003); Lewis v. Gagne, No. 02-CV-0219, 2003 WL\n22006403 (N.D.N.Y. August 20, 2003); Selah v. Goord, 255 F. Supp.2d 42 (N.D.N.Y. 2003); Flaherty v. Seroussi,\n209 F.R.D. 295 (N.D.N.Y. 2001).\n17\n\nproceedings before the United States Congress.  Cuneo and LaDuca have successfully prosecuted\ncomplex class actions, including cases involving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer\nprotection  and  products  liability  in  state  and  federal  courts  throughout  the  United  States.\nSpecifically, Cuneo and LaDuca were sole co-lead counsel in the Entran II product liability\nlitigation, which yielded a settlement of $324 million and covered all 50 states and Canada.  Also,\nCuneo was lead counsel in the Hungarian Gold Train case, which in September 2005 resulted in the\ncreation of a settlement fund of $25.5 million for Hungarian Holocaust survivors.  In addition to this\nexperience, Cuneo and LaDuca are co-counsel in several strip search class actions with Mr. Keach,\none of which was recently certified in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nNew York against the County of Schenectady and other related Defendants.\nJason Rozger and Bruce Menken of Bernbaum Menken Ben-Asher & Bierman, LLP have\nextensive experience with civil rights and civil liberties litigation, and have been found to be\nadequate class counsel in several similar class actions in this district.  See Marriott, supra; Kahler\nv. County of Rensselaer, 03 CV. 1324 (TJM)(DRH); McDaniel v. County of Schenectady, 04 CV.\n0757 (GLS)(RFT) (preliminary approval of settlement).  \nGary E. Mason and Alexander E. Barnett of the Mason Law Firm, P.C. have extensive\nexperience in scores of class action lawsuits and complex litigation such as this.  Mr. Mason has\nserved as either lead or co-counsel in scores of class action lawsuits, including In Re Diet Drugs\nProd. Liab. Litig., In Re the Exxon Valdez, In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Prod Liab. Litig. and In\nRe Swanson Creek Oil Spill, and the Entran II product liability litigation (Galanti v. Goodyear Tire\n& Rubber Co., No. 03-CV-209, D.N.J.).  Mr. Barnett of The Mason Law Firm has litigated\nnumerous class actions, including In re Diet Drugs Prod. Liab. Litig., 282 F. 3d 220 (3rd Cir. 2002),\nthe Entran II litigation, In re Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., ATX, ATX II and Wilderness Tires Products\n18\n\nLiability Litig., MDL No. 1371 (S.D. In.); Turner v. General Electric Company., No. 2:05-CV-186-\nFtM-33DNF (M.D. Fla.); and  Staton, et al. v. Irving Materials, Inc., et al., No. 03-CI-588 (Ky. Cir.\nCt., 4th Judicial Cir., Hopkins City 2005).\nIn short, the Phyllis Mitchell is an adequate class representative and has retained experienced\nclass counsel that has and will continue to aggressively litigate this action.  Plaintiff has satisfied\nthis requirement for certification.\nE. Plaintiff Has Satisfied the Requirements for a Money Damages Class\nUnder  Rule  23(b)(3),  as  the  Common  Issues  Shared  by  Class  Members\nPredominate Over Individual Issues and A Class Action is the Superior Method\nby Which to Prosecute this Case.\nRule 23(b)(3) permits certification when “the court finds that the questions of law or fact\ncommon to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\nadjudication of the controversy.” \nThe  party  proposing  a  class  action  must  establish  that  issues  common  to  the  class\npredominate over the individual issues of particular class members.  Amchem Prod. v. Windsor, 521\nU.S. 591, 623 (1997).  The predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) is satisfied once the plaintiff\nestablishes that “the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof, and thus\napplicable to the class as a whole ... predominate over those issues that are subject to only\nindividualized proof.”  Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 136.  The most pragmatic way for the Court to make\nthis determination is to evaluate whether “common proof will predominate at trial.”  In Re NASDAQ\nMarket Makers, 169 F.R.D. 473, 517 (S.D.N.Y. 1996); see also In re Plastics Additives Antitrust\nLitig.,  Civ.  Act.  No.  03-2038,  2006  U.S.  Dist.  Lexis  69105,  *18  (E.D.Pa.  Sept.  1,  2006)\n(“satisfaction of the predominance prong of the class certification standard does not require plaintiffs\n19\n\nto prove evidence establishing each element of their cause of action at the class certification stage,\nbut, instead, requires plaintiffs to make a threshold showing that each element of their claim may\nbe proven through common, class-wide evidence, rather than through evidence particular to each\nmember of the class.”). \nHere, all of the proposed class members’ claims revolve around one central legal issue: did\nthe CCJ maintain an unconstitutional policy of strip searching every pretrial detainee admitted to\nthe CCJ, without regard to reasonable suspicion that the detainee was concealing contraband?  The\nproposed class members’ claims also share common factual issues – did such a practice exist during\nthe two class periods, how long did the practice exist, and is the County of Clinton responsible for\nthis practice?  Clearly, legal and factual issues in this litigation predominate over any individual\nissues.  The Second Circuit has concluded that the predominance and superiority requirements of\nRule 23 are satisfied in this kind of strip search case.  Specifically, in In Re: Nassau County Strip\nSearch Cases, 461 F.3d 219 (2d Cir. Aug. 24, 2006), the court reversed the district court’s denial\nof class certification in a similar strip search case and ordered the district court to certify a class –\nat least for liability purposes – because the issue of whether the county’s blanket strip search policy\nviolated the law predominated all individual issues in the case and adjudication of liability in a\nsingle proceeding was the superior method of managing the case.  Id. at 230-31.  The determination\nin In Re Nassau County that cases concerning policies of strip searching everyone brought to\ncorrectional  facilities  satisfy  the  requirements  of  FRCP  23(b)(3)  is  not  impacted  by  IPO.\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs satisfy FRCP 23(b)(3).\nDefendants may claim that the need to analyze the existence of reasonable suspicion for each\nclass member is an issue that predominates over any other common issues.  This argument fails for\ntwo reasons.  First, the metaphysical possibility that some of the class members may, at the time of\n20\n\ntheir arrests, have had characteristics that might add up to reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip\nsearch is irrelevant to the events that routinely occurred at the CCJ:  the complaint alleges and the\nevidence shows that the County’s practice did not (and does not) consider the presence or absence\nof reasonable suspicion when conducting strip searches at admission.  Similarly, the deposition\ntestimony cited herein confirms that for at least part of the class period, corrections officers did not\nmake any inquiry as to reasonable suspicion before strip searching an arrestee – all detainees were\nstrip searched.  It would be disingenuous at best for correction officials to claim the possibility of\nfacts supporting reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search if they did not, in the first instance,\nmake an inquiry as to this point.  See Dodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177, 182 (S.D.N.Y.\n2005) (“If individualized assessments were in fact not made, then all the searches were illegal,\nbecause each new arrival was constitutionally entitled to an individualized assessment of his or her\ncircumstances…  [T]he fact that a particular class member could have been lawfully strip searched\nif [the correctional facility] had made the constitutionally required assessment is a defense to a\nparticular class member’s claim for damages, not a defense to the class-wide claim that the County\nsearched everyone without making any assessment at all.”); Lee v. Perez, 175 F. Supp.2d 673\n(S.D.N.Y. 2001) (directed verdict entered for strip search plaintiff where search officer could not\nstate reasons for search and the fact that there could be post hoc factors that might support\nreasonable suspicion was irrelevant).\nSecond, even if issues of reasonable suspicion do exist, they do not predominate over the\ncommon issues of law and fact.  As noted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit:\nDefendants argue that because the reasonableness of any search must be examined\non a case by case basis, the constitutionality of strip searches cannot be properly\nevaluated in a class action.  The basis for the complaint, however, arises precisely\n21\n\nbecause the Defendants did not conduct an individualized assessment of the need for\neach search.  Plaintiffs allege ... their constitutional rights were violated by a policy\nor custom, written or unwritten, to search every arrestee who entered the Correc-\ntional Facility, regardless of the individual circumstances.  Due to the single legal\ntheory and the similar facts for each Plaintiff, a class action would be superior to\nindividual actions. \nEddleman v. Jefferson County, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 25298, *15 (6th Cir. Aug.27, 1996) (emphasis\nadded); Langley v. Coughlin, 715 F. Supp. 522, 557-58 (S.D.N.Y. 1989).  Thus, common issues\npredominate over any individual issues.  See also Marriott, supra at 173:\nWhile there are as many as 2,000 class members, there is one central issue of law –\nwhether the change out strip search violates the Fourth Amendment.  Piece meal\nlitigation by multiple plaintiffs in multiple law suits would not promoted efficiency\nand would be inferior to litigation of the issue in one suit.\nAccordingly, any post hoc argument that reasonable suspicion might have existed for any particular\nclass member is of no import, and should not prevent class certification.  \nDefendant may also claim that the instant case requires a determination of damages for each\nindividual, and that this predominates over other common issues.  That damages may have to be\ncalculated individually does not preclude class certification.  As the Second Circuit held in Visa\nCheck:\nThere are a number of management tools available to a district court to address any\nindividualized damages issues that might arise in a class action, including (1)\nbifurcating  liability  and  damages  trials  with  the  same  or  different  juries;  (2)\nappointing a magistrate judge or special master to preside over individual damages\nproceedings; (3) decertifying the class after the liability trial and providing notice to\nclass members concerning how they may proceed to prove damages; (4) creating\nsubclasses; or (5) altering or amending the class.\nVisa Check, 280 F.3d at 41; see also Maneely, 208 F.R.D. at 78 (“it would be improper to let\nmanageability concerns overwhelm the predominance decision.  There is a common issue at the core\nof this case – whether defendants maintained an unconstitutional blanket strip search policy during\nthe class ... I find these common issues represent a sufficient constellation of common issues binding\n22\n\nthe class member together.”) (quotations omitted). \nGiven the nature of this action, and in light of the fact that a substantial proportion of the\nclass membership is comprised of economically disenfranchised individuals, a class action is also\nthe superior method by which to adjudicate claims of individual class members.  Poor and\nmarginalized class members are unlikely to be able to litigate their cases individually.  Mack, 191\nF.R.D. at 25; D'Alauro v. GC Services Ltd., 168 F.R.D. 451, 458 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (It is appropriate\nfor the court to consider the \"inability of the poor or uninformed to enforce their rights and the\nimprobability  that  large  numbers  of  class  members  would  possess  the  initiative  to  litigate\nindividually.\"); Tardifff, 365 F.3d at 7 (“class status here is not only the superior means, but\nprobably the only feasible one ... to establish liability and perhaps damages”).  The class action\ndevice is designed for the situation where an individual seeks to vindicate \"the rights of groups of\npeople who individually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents into court at\nall.”  Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 617.  \"The policy at the very core of the class action mechanism\nis to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to\nbring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.  A class action solves this problem by aggregating\nthe relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone's (usually an attorney's)\nlabor.”  Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 25 (citations omitted).  \nHere, the prosecution of this litigation as a class action is superior to having thousands of\nindividual cases being filed in this Court, each of which would be repetitious and possibly yield\ninconsistent adjudications.  See Califano v. Yamaski, 42 U.S. 682, 700-701 (1979); see also In re\nCigna Corp. Securities Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. Lexis 58560, *16-17; Dodge, 226 F.R.D. at 183\n(“Where a single issue (such as the existence of a uniform policy) is guaranteed to come up time and\ntime again, issues of judicial economy strongly militate in favor of resolving that issue via a\n23\n\ntechniques that will bind as many persons as possible.”).  Assuming arguendo that summary\njudgment is not eventually granted against the County, the trial in this action could last for many\nweeks, with scores of Jail employees being examined about the practices of Clinton County in an\neffort to establish municipal liability on behalf of the County.  Allowing for a even a small\nproportion of class members to have duplicative trials on this issue would be an enormous waste of\njudicial time and resources, and would not be the superior or appropriate way to resolve this\ncontroversy.  For these reasons, Plaintiff respectfully urges this Court to grant the motion for class\ncertification.\nF. Plaintiff Has Also Satisfied the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).\nRule 23(b)(2) permits certification when “the party opposing the class has acted or refused\nto act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief\nor corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). \nA (b)(2) class will be certified where “class wide injunctive or declaratory relief is necessary to\nredress a group-wide injury,” Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co. 267 F.3d 147, 162 (2d\nCir. 2001), and certification under (b)(3) is appropriate where the class member’s entitlement to\ndamages flows directly from the claims for class-wide declaratory or injunctive relief.  Id., at 165;\nsee also Marriot, supra  at 172.  Rule 23(b)(2) is “almost automatically satisfied in actions primarily\nseeking injunctive relief,”  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d 48, 58 (3rd Cir. 1994).  Courts have noted that Rule\n23(b)(2) is \"an especially appropriate vehicle for civil rights actions seeking... declaratory relief  'for\nprison and hospital reform.'\" Coley v. Clinton, 635 F.2d 1364, 1378 (8th Cir. 1980) (quoting 3B J.\nMoore & J. Kennedy, Moore's Federal Practice P 23.40(1) (1980)).  Where proposed class\nrepresentatives seek both monetary and injunctive relief, the District Court should allow (b)(2)\ncertification where (1) the positive weight or value to the plaintiffs of the injunctive or declaratory\n24\n\nrelief sought is predominant even though compensatory or punitive damages are also claimed, and\n(2) class treatment would be efficient and manageable, thereby achieving an appreciable measure\nof judicial economy.  Dodge, 208 F.R.D. at 90.  \nHere, the Plaintiff has satisfied the requirements of (b)(2).  The questions of whether the\nDefendants maintained an unconstitutional strip search policy, and the duration of that policy, are\nclearly issues that are appropriate for class-wide declaratory and/or injunctive relief.  Proving the\nexistence of such an unconstitutional policy is in the interest of each and every class member.  In\naddition, class treatment would be efficient and manageable, as the adjudication of these issues\ncould happen once, with the attendant judicial economy.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have satisfied the\nrequirements of a (b)(2) class as well.\nG. Clinton County Should Be Required to Assist Class Counsel in Providing \nNotice to Absent Class Members. \n“[I]f a defendant can undertake the tasks associated [with class notice] with less expenses\nand difficulty than could a plaintiff, the defendant may be ordered to provide notice.”  LaFlamme,\n212 F.R.D. at 459.  Class counsel is fully prepared and able to provide notice to all class members.\nThe County of Clinton, however, which is in possession of all the addresses and social security\nnumbers for the prospective class members, could assemble them into a readily accessible electronic\ndatabase for a mass mailing.  As such, Plaintiff respectfully suggests that the County should\nreasonably be required to “provide the notice or ... cooperate with plaintiff by giving him the\ninformation necessary to provide the notice.”  Id. at 460. \nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification should be granted.\n25\n\nDated: January 29, 2007 Respectfully submitted by:\nNew York, New York\nBeranbaum Menken Ben-Asher & Bierman LLP\nBy: __________/s/_____________________\nJason J.

For at least the past several years, the Clinton \nCounty Sheriff’s Department has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter \nthe Clinton County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon which \nthey are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from the \nwritten procedures of the Clinton County Sheriff’s Department, and was promulgated by \nsenior  Department  officials;  specifically,  Defendants  David  Favro,  Jerry  Maggy  and \nMichael Smith.   \n  1\n\nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In fact, several judges in this Judicial \nDistrict, as well as the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, have \nrecently held that blanket strip search policies/practices like those in dispute in this case \nare unconstitutional.  In short, the policy of Clinton County and the Clinton County \nSheriff’s  Department  to  forcing  those  charged  with  minor  crimes  to  undergo  the \nindignities of a strip search upon entry into the Clinton County Jail is not only clearly \nillegal, but is degrading, insensitive and unnecessary.  \n  Phyllis Mitchell brings this action on behalf of herself, and on behalf of a class of \nthousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to \nvindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of her civil rights and those of the class \nmembers she proposes to represent.  Ms. Mitchell was charged with several unclassified \nAgricultural & Markets Law misdemeanors for not feeding her dogs, and was subjected \nto a strip search, in violation of their right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  She seeks monetary damages for herself \nand each member of the proposed class, a declaration that the Sheriff’s Department’s \npolicies/practices are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding Clinton County and \nthe Clinton County Sheriff’s Department from continuing to violate the rights of those \nplaced into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiff Phyllis Mitchell, through \ncounsel, hereby complains as follows: \n \n  2\n\nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise \nto  Plaintiffs’  claims  and  those  of  proposed  class  members  occurred  in  this  judicial \ndistrict. \n \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Phyllis A. Mitchell (“Mitchell”) is 47 years old and resides in Clinton \nCounty, New York.  On or about March 27, 2003, Mitchell was arrested and placed in the \nClinton County Jail on charges of Abandonment of Animals, Failure to Provide Proper \nSustenance  (two  counts),  and  Failure  to  Provide  Proper  Food  and  Drink,  all \nmisdemeanors under New York’s Agricultural and Markets Law.  Ms. Mitchell was also \ncharged with the violation of having an unlicensed dog. \n4.  Defendant  County  of  Clinton  (the  “County”)  is  a  county  government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of New York.  At all times relevant \nhereto, the County, acting through its Sheriff’s Department, was responsible for the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to \n  3\n\nthe Clinton County Jail and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision \nand  conduct  of  all  Sheriff’s  Department  personnel,  including  those  working  in  the \nClinton County Jail.  In addition, at all relevant times, the County was responsible for \nenforcing the rules of the Clinton County Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriff’s Department \npersonnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of the United States and of \nthe State of New York. \n5.  The Clinton County Sheriff’s Department (the “Sheriff’s Department”) is a \nCounty Sheriff’s Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of New \nYork.  Although not a legal entity for the purposes of litigation, the Department is listed \nas a party for the purposes of identification.  At all times relevant hereto, the Sheriff’s \nDepartment was responsible for operating, organizing, overseeing and administering the \nClinton  County  Jail  (“CCJ”).    At  all  times  relevant  hereto,  Defendant  Sheriff’s \nDepartment,  together  with  the  County  of  Clinton,  was  responsible  for  the  polices, \npractices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the CCJ, \nand  was  responsible  for  the  appointment,  training,  supervision  and  conduct  of  all \nSheriff’s Department personnel, including those working in the CCJ.  In addition, at all \ntimes  relevant  hereto,  Defendant  Sheriff’s  Department,  together  with  the  County  of \nClinton, was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Clinton County Jail, and for \nensuring  that  Sheriff’s  Department  personnel  employed  in  the  CCJ  obeyed  the \nConstitution and laws of the United States and of the State of New York. \n6.  Defendant David Favro (“Sheriff Favro”) is the duly elected Sheriff of Clinton \nCounty, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other \ndetainees  over  which  the  CCJ  exercises  custodial  or  other  control.    Sheriff  Favro’s \n  4\n\nprincipal place of business is 25 McCarthy Drive, Plattsburgh, NY  12901.  Sheriff Favro \nis made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official capacities. \n7.  Defendant  Jerry  Maggy  (“Undersheriff  Maggy”)  is  the  duly  appointed \nUndersheriff of Clinton County and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the \ntreatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the CCJ exercises custodial or other \ncontrol.    Undersheriff  Maggy’s  principal  place  of  business  is  25  McCarthy  Drive, \nPlattsburgh, NY  12901.  Undersheriff Maggy is made a Defendant in this action in both \nhis individual and official capacities. \n8.  Defendant Michael Smith (“Major Smith”) is the duly appointed Major of the \nClinton County Sheriff’s Department and is the officer in charge of the operation of the \nClinton  County  Jail.    As  such,  Major  Smith  is  a  policy  maker  with  respect  to  the \ntreatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the CCJ exercises custodial or other \ncontrol.  Major Smith’s principal place of business is 25 McCarthy Drive, Plattsburgh, \nNY  12901.  Major Smith is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and \nofficial capacities. \n9.  Collectively, Sheriff Favro, Undersheriff Maggy, and Major Smith will be \nreferred to as the “Policy Making Defendants.” \n  5\n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n10. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Clinton County Jail. \n11. The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nClinton  County  Jail  after  being  charged  with  misdemeanors, \nviolations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil \ncommitments  or  other  minor  crimes  and  were  or  will  be  strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Clinton County Jail pursuant to \nthe  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Clinton  County  Sheriff’s \nDepartment  and  the  County  of  Clinton.    The  class  period \ncommences on February 28, 2003 and extends to the date on which \nthe  Clinton  County  Sheriff’s  Department  and/or  the  County  of \nClinton  are  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise  cease,  enforcing  their \nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  conducting  strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from \nthe class are Defendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.   \n \n12. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n13. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Clinton County Jail every month – all of \nwhom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the \nproposed class totals at least 2,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights \nviolated on multiple occasions. \n  6\n\n14. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Clinton County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindividually. \n15. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’ \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Clinton \nCounty Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established \nlaw in this judicial circuit. \n16. Plaintiff’s  claims  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  members  of  the  Class.  \nPlaintiff and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n17. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff \nhas no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n18. Plaintiff has retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiff is being \nrepresented by Elmer Robert Keach, III; Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger of Berenbaum \n  7\n\nMenken & Ben-Asher, LLP; Gary E. Mason and Charles Schneider of The Mason Law \nFirm, PLLC; and Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP.  \nMr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who has litigated a \nwide  variety  of  civil  rights  actions  before  this  Court,  and  has  litigated  class  action \nlawsuits in state and federal courts in five states.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated a \nseries of strip search class actions before this Court, including cases against Rensselaer, \nSchenectady and Montgomery County. \n19. Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger are both experienced civil rights attorneys \nfrom New York City, having litigated scores of civil rights cases against a number of \nDefendants, including one prison brutality case presently pending in this District.  Mr. \nMenken and Mr. Rozger have successfully represented many victims of illegal strip \nsearches, including several who opted out of the recent class action litigation against the \nCity of New York.  Mr. Menken and Mr. Rozger were also co-counsel in the Rensselaer, \nSchenectady, Montgomery and Schoharie County class actions. \n20. Gary E. Mason is one of this country’s premier class action attorneys, with \noffices in Washington, DC.  Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against \nFortune 500 companies in both state and federal court in over a dozen jurisdictions, \nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of \n$ 950 million dollars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high \nprofile class actions, including In Re The Exxon Valdez, In Re Diet Drugs Product \nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation.  In \naddition to his extensive experience as a class action and environmental lawyer, Charles \nSchneider is a former trial attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights \n  8\n\nDivision and has successfully litigated a series of cases involving corrections misconduct.  \nMr. Mason and Mr. Schneider were also co-counsel in the Rensselaer, Schenectady and \nMontgomery County class actions. \n21. Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Waldman & Gilbert, have \nextensive  experience  in  state  and  federal  trial  and  appellate  courts,  before  law \nenforcement authorities and in proceedings before the United States Congress.  Cuneo \nand LaDuca have successfully prosecuted several complex class actions, including cases \ninvolving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer protection and products liability \nin state and federal courts throughout the United States.  Mr. Cuneo and Mr. LaDuca \nwere also co-counsel in the Schenectady County class action. \n22. In short, Plaintiff’s counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against Clinton County, the Clinton County Sheriff’s \nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiff knows of no \nconflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n23. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the \nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Clinton County \nJail.  In short, the County of Clinton, the Clinton County Sheriff’s Department, the Policy \nMaking Defendants and Clinton County Corrections Officers acted on grounds generally \napplicable to all class members. \n24. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \nseeks certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n  9\n\n25. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of  law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy/practice \nof  strip  searching  all  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  minor  crimes  and \ncommitted  to  the  Clinton  County  Jail  is  a  violation  of  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de \nfacto policy existed during the class period. \n26. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area.    Furthermore,  the  expense  and  burden  of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n27. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for the past several \nyears. \n  10\n\n28. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff also \nseeks partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \n  11\n\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n29. The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers  they  supervise,  from  performing  strip  searches  of  arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes unless the officer has reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n30. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  County  of  Clinton,  the  Clinton  County \nSheriff’s Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or \nde  facto  policy,  custom  or  practice  of  strip  searching  all  individuals  who  enter  the \ncustody of the Clinton County Jail (by forcing them to remove their clothing for a visual \ninspection of their bodies and/or forcing them to submit to a visual inspection of their \nbody cavities) and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their charged \ncrime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was \nconcealing a weapon or contraband. For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual \ncavity searches are collectively referred to as “strip searches.” \n31. The County of Clinton, the Clinton County Sheriff’s Department, and the \nPolicy  Making  Defendants  know  that  they  may  not  institute,  enforce  or  permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion.  This judicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may \nnot  strip  search  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle being clearly established in 1986 \nby Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986) and recently affirmed by Shain v. Ellison, \n  12\n\n273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied sub. nom, Nassau Co. v. Shain, 537 U.S. 1083 \n(2002).   \n32. The  Defendants’  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n33. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n34. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  County  of  Clinton,  the  Clinton  County \nSheriff’s Department and Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, \nenforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of \nstrip searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Clinton County Jail and \nplaced into jail clothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed \nsuspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-\ntrial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the \narrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of \nthe policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches.   \n35. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Clinton County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable \n  13\n\nsuspicion.    Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n36. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches – \neach member of the class, including the named Plaintiff – has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n37. Phyllis Mitchell’s experience is representative of the class at large.  On or \nabout March 27, 2003, Ms. Mitchell was arrested and placed in the Clinton County Jail \non charges of Abandonment of Animals, Failure to Provide Proper Sustenance (two \ncounts), and Failure to Provide Proper Food and Drink (to animals), all misdemeanors \nunder New York’s Agricultural and Markets Law.  Ms. Mitchell subsequently spent one \nnight in the Clinton County Jail before posting $7,000.00 bail, and was released from the \nClinton County Jail on March 28, 2003.  Ms. Mitchell is presently 47 years old, and has \nno prior criminal history.  She was taken into custody by the New York State Police.  The \ncircumstances of her criminal charges are that she is alleged to have failed to feed several \nanimals at her former home in Ellenberg, New York.  Upon information and belief, these \ncharges were eventually resolved with Ms. Mitchell agreeing to an Adjournment in \nContemplation of Dismissal.   \n38. At approximately 7:00 PM on or about March 27, 2003, Ms. Mitchell was \ntransported to the Clinton County Jail on $7,000.00 bail.  Approximately thirty minutes \nlater, Ms. Mitchell was moved into a room with lockers on the wall in the booking area of \n  14\n\nthe Clinton County Jail and was forced to remove her clothing.  As a Corrections Officer \nwatched,  Ms.  Mitchell  removed  all  of  her  clothing,  including  her  underpants  and \nbrassiere.   \n39.  A Corrections Officer then instructed Ms. Mitchell to lift her breasts, and \nthen to squat and cough.  Ms. Mitchell complied, with the Corrections Officer conducting \na visual inspection of Ms. Mitchell’s vaginal and rectal area.  Mitchell was then provided \nwith a jail uniform. \n40. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMs. Mitchell was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was \nmade of Ms. Mitchell that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.   \n41. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Ms. Mitchell \nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n \n \n  15\n\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law -- \n \n42. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 41. \n43. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n44. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiff’s rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Clinton \nCounty Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiff and class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the \nPolicy Making Defendants to order/direct Clinton County Corrections Officers to conduct \nsuch searches.   \n45. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the County of Clinton and the Clinton County Sheriff’s Department.  As such, the \nCounty of Clinton is directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members \nof the Class. \n46. Upon information and belief, Sheriff Favro, Undersheriff Maggy and Major \nSmith are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the \n  16\n\noperation of the Clinton County Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of the \nstrip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Favro, Maggy and Smith are each \nindividually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the \nClass.    \n47. Sheriff Favro, Undersheriff Maggy and Major Smith knew that the CCJ’s strip \nsearch policy was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to \ndeprive Plaintiff and members of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n48. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n49. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured. \n \n  17\n\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n \n50. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 49. \n51. The policy, custom and practice of the Clinton County Sheriff’s Department, \nthe County of Clinton and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in \nthat  these  entities  and  individuals  are  directing/conducting  the  strip  searches  of  all \nindividuals placed into the Clinton County Jail without any particularized suspicion that \nthe individuals in question have either contraband or weapons. \n52. Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Clinton and the \nClinton County Sheriff’s Department to be unconstitutional. \n \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n53. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 52. \n54. The policy, custom and practice of the Clinton County Sheriff’s Department, \nthe County of Clinton and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in \nthat  these  entities  and  individuals  are  directing/conducting  the  strip  searches  of  all \nindividuals placed into the Clinton County Jail without any particularized suspicion that \nthe individuals in question have either contraband or weapons. \n  18\n\n55. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Clinton \nCounty Jail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff.   \n56. The  continuing  pattern  of  strip  searching  individuals  charged  with  minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n57. Plaintiff demands that the County of Clinton, the Clinton County Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the Policy Making Defendants and Clinton County Corrections Officers \nimmediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of the Clinton \nCounty Jail absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have \neither contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction \nfrom this Court ordering as much. \n \n \n \n  19\n\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n58.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n59. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Clinton and the \nClinton County Sheriff’s Department have no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary \nto  punish  the  Policy  Making  Defendants,  and  to  send  a  message  to  them  that  the \nrequirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government officials in \nClinton County. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n60. The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Phyllis Mitchell, on behalf of herself and on behalf of a \nclass  of  others  similarly  situated,  request  that  this  Honorable  Court  grant  her  the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiff’s First \nCause  of  Action  detailed  herein,  awarding  Compensatory  Damages  to  each  named \nPlaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury \nand/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis.  \n  20\n\nC.  A  judgment  against  Defendant  David  Favro  on  Plaintiff’s  First  Cause  of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nD.  A  judgment  against  Defendant  Jerry  Maggy  on  Plaintiff’s  First  Cause  of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nE.  A judgment against Defendant Michael Smith on Plaintiff’s First Cause of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nF.  A  declaratory  judgment  against  all  Defendants  declaring  the  County  of \nClinton and the Clinton County Sheriff’s Department’s policy, practice and custom of \nstrip and visual cavity searching all detainees entering the Clinton County Jail, regardless \nof the crime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nG.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendants  from \ncontinuing to strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \nH.  A monetary award for attorney’s fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ.

The Parties acknowledge that prompt approval, consummation, and\nimplementation of the Settlement set forth in this Settlement Agreement are essential.

If, at any time, whether by order of any court or otherwise, the\nSettlement does not become final, then any unspent money remaining from the Initial Contribu-\n10\n\ntion shall be returned to the County.  Any future class-wide settlement or class-wide judgment\nwould be offset by the spent, unreturned amount of the Initial Contribution. \n3. The County’s remaining monetary obligation of $1,100,000 will be deposited into\nthe Settlement Fund within five days of the Effective date.\n4. Nothing in this Agreement nor any attachments shall obligate any Defendant to\npay a cumulative amount in excess of $1,150,000.00.\nB. Payments to Class Members\n1. Each class member who submits a timely Claim Form will be entitled to\nreceive a pro rata share of the Both Subclass Distribution Amount.\n2. In addition to the share set forth in part III.B.1, each class member who is a\nmember of Subclass A will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of the SubSubclass A\nSupplemental Distribution Amount.   \n3. No Class Member shall be entitled to more than his or her pro rata share of the\nBoth Subclass Distribution Amount and the Subclass A Supplemental Distribution Amount (if\napplicable) regardless of the number of times he or she has been booked and/or strip searched\nand regardless of whether he or she is a member of both Subclasses.  Class Members who are\nmembers of both subclasses may file a Claim Form as a member of Subclass A.\n4. The Defendants have represented to Class Counsel that substantial remedial\nefforts were made regarding Clinton County Jail strip search policies and practices during the\ntime period of July 1, 2006 to July 1, 2007.  Class Counsel suspects that some individuals were\nstrip searched during the time period of July 1, 2006 to July 1, 2007.  The parties agree that\nadditional verification efforts will be made by Class Counsel to ascertain whether individuals\nadmitted to the Clinton County Jail during this time period were strip searched.  The Defendants\n11\n\nwill cooperate in full with these efforts, including providing access to inmate records, with\nreasonable notice and without charge to the Class or Class Counsel.  The decision about whether\nor not an individual from this time period will be included in this class will rest in the sole\ndiscretion of class counsel.  In the event that a class member disputes class counsel's determina-\ntion, they will have the right to apply to the Mediator to contest this decision.  The decision of\nthe Mediator in this regard will be final.\n5. The Clinton County Department of Social Services, and any other department or\nsubdivision of the County, agree not to serve any lien notices on Class Counsel, the Settlement\nAdministrator, or any financial institution where the Settlement Fund is deposited.  This\nprovision will not, however, limit the Clinton County Department of Social Services’, or any\nother department or subdivision of the County’s ability to pursue any lawful liens over the funds\nof individual class members.\n6. The Clinton County Department of Social Services, or any other department or\nsubdivision of the County, will take no affirmative steps, except as required by law, to publicize\nor disseminate the fact that any Class Member has made a claim on the within settlement.  The\nClinton County Department of Social Services, or any other department or subdivision of the\nCounty also agrees not to voluntarily disclose, publicize, or disseminate the list of class members\nfor a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of Final Judgment.\nC. Release and Discontinuance of Defendants\n1. Upon the execution of this settlement agreement, Plaintiffs shall execute full,\nunconditional releases and partial Stipulation of Discontinuance (without prejudice) for\nDefendants Favro, Maggy and Smith, regarding all claims arising out of this case.  These\nreleases will be held in escrow until final approval of this Settlement Agreement by the Court, at\n12\n\nwhich time said releases will be provided to counsel for the Defendants.  The Partial Stipulation\nof Discontinuance (without prejudice) of the individual capacity claims will be filed with the\nCourt immediately upon the disbursement of the payment prescribed by Section III(A)(2).\nD. Attorneys Fees and Expenses\n1. Class Counsel will petition the Court for an award of attorneys’ fees in an amount\nnot to exceed 30% of the Settlement Fund, as well as for an award for litigation expenses\nincurred prior to the execution of this agreement, in an amount not to exceed fifteen thousand\n($15,000) dollars.  Defendants shall not oppose Class Counsel’s application for said award of\nfees and expenses.  Should Class Counsel’s petition for attorney’s fees not be approved by the\nCourt, Defendants shall not oppose an appeal by Class Counsel of such application, and Class\nCounsel will file all necessary motions and papers to relieve Defendants of the obligation to\nparticipate in any appeal.  If the Court issues an order granting final approval of the settlement,\nbut without approval of the requested award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, Defendants shall\nfund the portion of the Distribution Amount, less the disputed part of the application for\nattorneys’ fees and expenses, and will pay the remainder into an escrow account to be paid in\naccordance with the outcome of the appeal.  \nE. Additional Discovery\n1. The Clinton County Department of Social Services (“DSS”) shall provide a last\nknown address for any Class Member for whom the initial mailing of the Class Notice was\nreturned as undeliverable.  DSS will not be responsible for spending more than 30 employee\nhours complying with this paragraph.  If more than 30 employee hours is required, payment for\nthose hours greater than 30 will be made from the Settlement Fund, at the DSS employee\nperforming the work’s regular hourly rate, as well as a supplemental rate of 25% of the em-\n13\n\nployee’s hourly rate to cover benefits to such employee(s).  Defendants’ counsel will notify\nClass Counsel as soon as practicable after the 30 hour threshold is reached.  \nIV.  NOTIFICATION TO CLASS MEMBERS\nA.

The Settlement Administrator shall provide an affidavit to the Court, with a copy\nto Class Counsel and Defendants’ Counsel, attesting to the measures undertaken to provide\nNotice of the Settlement to Settlement Class Members.\n5.

The agreed-upon procedures and requirements for filing objections in connection\nwith the Final Approval Hearing are intended to ensure the efficient administration of justice and\nthe orderly presentation of any Class Members' objections to the Settlement Agreement, in\naccordance with such Class Members’ due process rights.  The Preliminary Approval Order and\nClass Notice will require all Class Members who have any objections to file such notice of\nobjection or request to be heard with the Clerk of the Court, and serve by mail or hand delivery\nsuch notice of objection or request to be heard, including all papers or evidence in support\nthereof, upon Class Counsel and Defendants’ Counsel, at the addresses set forth in the Class\nNotice, no later than the Objection Date.  The Preliminary Approval Order will further provide\nthat objectors who fail to properly or timely file their objections with the Clerk of the Court,\nalong with the required information and documentation set forth above, or to serve them as\nprovided above shall not be heard during the Final Approval Hearing, nor shall their objections\n16\n\nbe considered by the Court. \nVII.  RELEASE, DISMISSAL OF ACTION, AND JURISDICTION OF COURT\nA. By this Settlement Agreement and the following Release, Defendants, and all of\ntheir respective affiliates, predecessors, successor and assigns, officers, agents, representatives,\nand employees are released from any and all claims or causes of action that were, could have\nbeen, or should have been asserted by the named Plaintiffs or any member of the Class against\nthe Released Persons, or any of them, based upon or related to all claims of unlawful searches\nasserted under either State or Federal law, and/or all claims for searches, strip searches, visual\ninspections, and/or visual observations of a Plaintiff’s or Class Member’s body.  \nB.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n-----------------------------------------------------X\nPHYLLIS A. MITCHELL, et. al.,\nPlaintiffs,\n-against-  No. 06-CV-0254 \n    (DRH)\nTHE COUNTY OF CLINTON,\nDefendant.\n-----------------------------------------------------X\nDAVID R. HOMER\nU.S. MAGISTRATE JUDGE\nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS \nACTION SETTLEMENT AND JUDGMENT\nThis case coming on for hearing before the undersigned Judge on December 4,\n2009 to conduct a final fairness hearing to determine whether the proposed\nSettlement Agreement between the parties is fair, reasonable and adequate, and to\naddress Class Counsel's application for an award of attorney's fees and costs; and the\nClass Members being represented by Class Counsel and Defendant being represented by\nits attorney; the Court having read and considered the Settlement Agreement, the Notice\nPlan, Affidavits, and Memoranda of Law submitted by Class Counsel, and having\nconsidered the submissions by Class members, now makes the following:\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. This action was commenced on February 28, 2006, as a class action.\n2. After years of intensive litigation, including extensive discovery and motion\npractice before this Court, and including the granting of the Plaintiffs’ motion for class\n\ncertification, and as a result of intensive, arm's length negotiations between Class Counsel\nand Defendant, as well as two settlement conferences before the Court, the parties have\nreached accord with respect to a settlement that provides substantial benefits to\nSettlement Class Members, in return for a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in\nthis case against the Defendant (\"Settlement Agreement\"). The resulting Settlement\nAgreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on March 10, 2009.\n3. As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a\nproposed Notice Plan and Class Notice, which provided Settlement Class Members notice\nof the proposed settlement. The Notice Plan provided an opportunity for class members to\nfile objections to the Settlement.\n4. As of the deadline for the filing of objections, no objections were filed. Given the\nsize of this Settlement Class, and the notice plan described above, this Court finds that\nthe absence of objections is indicative of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of\nthe Settlement with the Defendant.\n5. The settling Parties have filed with the Court an affidavit from Jose C. Fraga\ndeclaring that the mailing of the Court-approved notice and newspaper advertising,\nconsistent with the Notice Plan, has been completed.\n6. The Court finds that the published notice, mailed notice, and Internet posting\nconstitute the best practicable notice of the Fairness Hearing, the proposed Settlement,\nClass Counsel's application for fees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the\nClass Notice and the Short Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due, and\nsufficient notice to all members of the Settlement Class, and complied fully with the\nrequirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the\n2\n\nUnited States, the laws of New York and any other applicable law.\n7. Any persons who wished to be excluded from this Action were provided an\nopportunity to “opt out” pursuant to the Notice. None have done so.  \n8. Class Members are bound by the Settlement, the Settlement Agreement and\nreleases contained therein, and the Final Order and Judgment, and do not have any\nfurther opportunity to opt-out of the Action.\n9. Any class member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to the\nSettlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiffs' Class\nCounsel's application for fees, costs, and expenses in accordance with the procedure set\nforth in the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of\nSettlement, is deemed to have waived any such objection by appeal, collateral attack, or\notherwise.\n10. On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation and the provisions of the\nSettlement Agreement, the Court finds that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable, and\nadequate compromise of the claims against the Defendant in this case, pursuant to Rule\n23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. There are a number of factors which the Court\nhas considered in affirming this Settlement, including:\nA. The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested.\nB. The Court notes that for settlement purposes, this Settlement has the\nbenefit of providing relief to Class Members now without further litigation. This Settlement\nprovides Class Members with a substantial monetary benefit.\nC. This Settlement is clearly a byproduct of hard-fought litigation between the\nparties and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or Counsel for the\n3\n\nDefendant.\nD. Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendant their\napplication for attorney’s fees, in the amount of $324,730.93 and expenses in the amount\nof $10,699.10, consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. This Court has\nconsidered Class Counsel's request and hereby grants the request.\nE. The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair,\na simplified process, and workable. In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to resolve\nany unanticipated problems.\nNow, therefore, on the basis of the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Court hereby\nmakes the following:\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n11. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this\nproceeding.\n12.

No. 06-CV-254\n    (NAM/DRH)\nTHE COUNTY OF CLINTON et al.,\nDefendants.\n                                                                                 \nDAVID R. HOMER\nU.S. MAGISTRATE JUDGE\nORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WHY DEFENDANTS \nSHOULD NOT BE COMPELLED TO OBTAIN SEPARATE COUNSEL\nOn June 21, 2006, a pretrial conference was held in this action pursuant\nto Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  At that time, the Court was\nmade aware that defendants David Favro, Jerry Maggy, and Michael Smith\n(collectively referred to herein as the “individual defendants”) are jointly\nrepresented by the same attorney who represents defendant County of Clinton\n(“County”). \nIn addition to defense counsel’s ethical obligation to inform each client of\nthe potential adverse consequences of joint representation, this Court has a\ncontinuing obligation to supervise the bar and assure litigants a fair trial.  See\nDunton v. County of Suffolk, State of N.Y., 729 F.2d 903, 908-09 (2d Cir.\n1984).  Accordingly, it is my duty to ensure that the individual defendants fully\n\nappreciate the potential inherent conflict in their joint representation with the\nCounty and understand the potential threat a conflict may pose to their\nindividual interests.  Id. at 909.  \nIt is therefore hereby ORDERED as follows: \n1. If it has not already been accomplished, defense counsel shall\nwithin ten (10) days of the date of this order send a copy of this order and a\nletter to the individual defendants in this action a) outlining the circumstances\nunder which an actual or potential conflict of interest may arise,1 and b)\nadvising whether counsel plans to take a position adverse to the interests of\nany individual defendant at trial.  \nWithin sixty (60) days of the date of this order, the individual\ndefendants shall proceed in one of the two ways described in subparagraphs\nA or B:\nA. If, after being informed in writing of the potential or actual\nconflicts, an individual defendant wishes to retain separate counsel, he may do\nso and new counsel shall file and serve a Notice of Appearance within sixty\n(60) days of the date of this order; \nOR\n1The letter shall include, but not be limited to, the circumstances listed in the\nattachment to this order.\n2\n\nB. In the event that an individual defendant wishes to proceed\nwhile being represented by his current counsel, I will require additional\nassurance that any such individual defendant has made an informed decision\nto do so notwithstanding the potential for conflict.  That assurance must be\nprovided in the form of a sworn affidavit from any such individual defendant a)\nacknowledging that he has been given written notice by counsel of the\npotential for conflict; b) acknowledging that he understands the potential\nconflict and its ramifications; and c) stating that he  has knowingly and\nvoluntarily chosen to proceed with joint representation.  Those affidavits and\ncounsel’s letter to the individual defendants shall be submitted to the\nchambers of the undersigned within sixty (60) days of the date of this order\nand, after review, will be filed under seal.  At the time of submission to the\nundersigned, the defendants shall file and serve a Notice of In Camera\nSubmission Regarding Joint Representation.\n3. If an individual defendant chooses to exercise the option outlined\nin paragraph 2(B) above, the Court will review defense counsel’s letter of\nnotification and the individual defendants’ affidavits ex parte and in camera to\ndetermine if the individual defendants have knowingly and voluntarily waived\ntheir rights to separate counsel.  \n3\n\n4. If the Court determines that the conflict is of a nature which can be\nwaived and an individual defendant’s waiver of the potential conflict is knowing\nand voluntary, the Court will allow that defendant to proceed with joint\nrepresentation.\n5. If the Court determines that an individual defendant has not\nknowingly and voluntarily waived his right to separate counsel, the Court shall\norder further action as necessary to safeguard the integrity of these\nproceedings. \n6. If an individual defendant consents to joint representation, he will\nnot be deemed to have waived his right to retain separate counsel.  However,\nno extension of deadlines established in the Uniform Pretrial Scheduling Order\nor of the trial date will be granted because of such substitution of counsel\nunless such defendant establishes that the substitution resulted from a conflict\nof interest which reasonably could not have been foreseen when that\ndefendant filed his affidavit agreeing to joint representation and that such\ndefendant promptly proceeded to obtain separate counsel upon learning of the\nconflict of interest.\nDATED:  June 22, 2006\n    Albany, New York\n4\n\nAttachment\nListed below are some, but not all, of the circumstances in which a\nconflict of interest may arise when two or more defendants are jointly\nrepresented by a single attorney or law firm.  The list is not exhaustive but\nserves only to illustrate examples of types of conflicts which may result from\nsuch joint representation.  An attorney should also advise a defendant of other\npossible conflicts specific to the facts of the particular case.\n1. It may be in the best interests of the government entity to assert as a defense that\na defendant was not acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time of events\nin issue.  However, such a defense would operate to the detriment of an individual\ndefendant and might place his or her defense in conflict with that of the government entity.\n2. The attorney may receive information from one defendant which is helpful to one\ndefendant but which undermines the defense of another defendant.  Where both\ndefendants are represented by the same attorney or law firm, the attorney-client privilege\nmay prevent the attorney or law firm from using that information in the defense of the\ndefendant for whom the information is favorable.\n3. The plaintiff may offer to settle or dismiss claims against one defendant in return\nfor cooperation with the plaintiff’s case.  If a defendant receives such an offer, a lawyer or\nlaw firm jointly representing defendants may not be able to provide unbiased advice on\nwhether to accept or reject such an offer because the acceptance of such an offer may\nundermine the case of other defendants whom the attorney or law firm represents.\n5\n\n4. During jury selection at trial, a particular potential juror may be perceived as\nfavorable to one defendant but unfavorable to another.  Where these defendants are jointly\nrepresented by one attorney or law firm, the attorney must choose the interests of one\ndefendant over those of the other in determining whether to select or reject that potential\njuror.\n5. In questioning a defendant during his or her testimony, an attorney who jointly\nrepresents other defendants in the same case may be inclined to limit or eliminate certain\nquestions where, although the answers would be helpful to the defense of one defendant,\nthose answers may undermine the defense of another defendant.\n6. In questioning non-party witnesses during testimony, an attorney who jointly\nrepresents two or more defendants in the same case may be inclined to limit or eliminate\ncertain questions where, although the answers would be helpful to the defense of one\ndefendant, those answers may undermine the defense of another defendant.\n7. In determining which witnesses and which exhibits to present at trial, an attorney\nor law firm jointly representing two or more defendants in the same case may be inclined\nnot to offer certain witnesses or exhibits because, although that evidence may be helpful to\nthe defense of one defendant, it undermines the defense of another defendant.\n8. If two or more defendants are found liable for punitive damages and a trial is held\non that issue, a lawyer or law firm jointly representing two or more defendants in the same\n6\n\ncase may be inclined to argue to the fact finder that one defendant was less responsible or\nless culpable than another.  However, while such an argument may benefit the defense of\nthat defendant, it may undermine the defense of another defendant who, the argument\nwould suggest, was more responsible or more culpable.\n7",
