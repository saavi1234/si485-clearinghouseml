The policy was to strip search all arrestees who were to be placed into general population, regardless of whether there was any suspicion of concealing contraband. One of the plaintiffs also alleged that she was subjected to excessive force by jail guards.  </p><p>On April 14, 1999, the District Court (Judge Inge P. Johnson) granted summary judgment to the defendants on plaintiffs' claims that they were each subjected to an unconstitutional strip search.  Judge Johnson denied defendants' motion as to the excessive force claim, finding that there were factual issues for the jury to resolve.  Shortly after the Court's ruling, the parties settled the case and filed a stipulation for dismissal with prejudice.  The settlement terms are unknown.</p><p></p>",

CV-98-J-1097-S \nSHERIFF JAMES JONES, \net aI.,  ENTERE~jJ \nDefendants.  APR  f 4 1991(\" \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nCurrently pending before the court is the defendants' motion for summary judgment \n(doc. 57), to which the plaintiff filed a brief in opposition thereto (\"plaintiff s opposition\"). \nThereafter, the defendants filed a reply to plaintiffs opposition. Both parties have also filed \nevidentiary submissions in support of their respective positions.  The defendants having \nrequested oral argument on their motion for summary judgment, the court heard the same on \nApril 14, 1999, at which time all parties were present by and through their attorneys of \nrecord.  The court has reviewed the motion, the memoranda of law and the evidentiary \nsubmissions of the parties and considered the arguments made at the hearing. \nI. PROCEDURAL mSTORY \nPlaintiffs commenced this action on May 4, 1998 by filing a complaint (doc. 1) \nalleging that the defendants violated the plaintiffs' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights \nto the Constitution o~the United States, through 42 U.S.c. § 1983 and state law violations. \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 2 of 14(cid:10)\nThe basis of the allegations for each plaintiff centers around being strip searched while in \ncustody of the defendants upon a lawful arrest.1  Plaintiff Mumpower also alleges that two \nemployees of the  Shelby County jail used excessive force  against the plaintiff.  See \namendment to complaint (doc. 19) at,-r 1.  The plaintiffs filed a wholly additional amended \ncomplaint on October 15, 1998 (doc. 30), although it contained no substantive differences. \nBased upon a consideration of the pleadings oral and written arguments of the parties and \nevidentiary submissions, the court concludes that the motion for summary judgment is due \nto be granted in part and denied in part. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nIn the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the facts of this case are as follows:  The \nbases of the complaint are two separate, wholly unrelated incidents both involving women \nwho were arrested and taken to jail in Shelby County, Alabama.  Each plaintiff alleges that \nthe strip search policy of the Shelby County jail is a violation of her constitutional rights and \nher right to privacy under state law. \nA. Plaintiff Mumpower \nPlaintiff Mumpower is a Georgia resident who was in Alabama visiting her brother \non October 18, 1997. This plaintiff alleged that she took new medication for which she had \na prescription.  Plaintiff states that she had a beer and later a glass of wine.  The plaintiff \nstates she then blacked out and has no further recollection until she was handcuffed and \n1P  laintiff Mumpower was arrested for public intoxication and plaintiff Grauel was \narrested for DUI.  See Complaint at ~6 and ~9. No allegation is made by either plaintiffthat her \narrest was unlawful in any manner. \n2 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 3 of 14(cid:10)\nplaced in a police car. Plaintiffs' brief at 1. Plaintiff s brother testified at deposition that the \nplaintiff was acting irrationally and out of character.  Depo. of Giambrone at 26.  By \naffidavit, the plaintiff states that her husband and brother \"called 911 due to the fact that they \nwere concerned about the way I was acting.  I do not remember any ofthis.\"2 Affidavit of \nplaintiff, submitted as Exhibit 1 to plaintiffs' brief; plaintiffs' brief at 1. Paramedics arrived \nand then the Shelby County Sheriffs Department deputies also came to Mr. Giambrone's \napartment. 3  Plaintiffs' brief at 1.  Plaintiff was arrested for public intoxication and taken to \nthe Shelby County Jail. Plaintiffs' brief at 1-2; Affidavit of Deputy Paul George ~ 2, \nsubmitted as exhibit D to  defendant's memorandum. \nAfter plaintiff was arrested, she was told to strip nude in front of Officer Stacey \nBlankenship, a female deputy.  Plaintiff alleges that the officer made an inappropriate \ncomment regarding plaintiffs physique while plaintiff was nude, however, plaintiff alleges \nno damages from this comment.4  Exhibit 1; Plaintiffs' brief at 2.  Plaintiff testified at \ndeposition that she was taken into a little room for this purpose and was only there long \n2In actuality, the plaintiffs husband called 911 because she started acting \"like she's a \nmental patient.\" Depo. of Charles Mumpower at 22-23, submitted as Exhibit F to defendants' \nmemorandum. \n3The Cahaba Valley Fire & Rescue Unit responded to the 911 call.  Affidavit of Stephen \nBrecht at ~~1-3, submitted as Exhibit E to defendants' memorandum.  While trying to ascertain \nwhat was wrong with the plaintiff, the plaintiff kicked one of the paramedics in the chest.  At this \npoint the paramedics decided to wait outside for the Shelby County deputies to arrive.  Although \nplaintiff alleges that she was arrested instead of receiving the medical treatment she needed \n(plaintiffs affidavit at 1), Mr. Brecht stated that the plaintiff refused his request to go to the \nhospital.  Exhibit E at ~15. \n4The court notes that even if true, the comment in question, while inappropriate, is not in \nviolation of any right alleged by plaintiff, nor does plaintiff make this comment the basis for <my \nof her allegations. \n3 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 4 of 14(cid:10)\nenough to take of her clothes, put on the jail j tlIhp suit and be handcuffed.5 Depo.ofplaintiff \nat 62, submitted as Exhibit C to defendants' memorandum. She also stated that there was no \nwindow in the room. ld. Plaintiff was rehandcuffed and taken to the \"drunk tank\" by Officer \nBlankenship and Officer Jason Smitherman. Exhibit 1; plaintiffs' brief at 2. Plaintiff alleges \nthat as she approached the entrance to the drunk tank, Officer Smitherman pulled the \nplaintiff s handcuffed arms up behind her back and that both officers then shoved her into \na cement wall, from which plaintiff sustained a broken nose.  Plaintiff also alleges that \nOfficer Blankenship spit on her while she was in the floor with her nose bleeding. Plaintiffs' \nbrief at 2; exhibit 1.  She further testified that the officers never had to drag her, pick her up \nor do anything to her to go in the direction they wanted.  Exhibit Cat 133.  She also stated \nthat she was shackled and cuffed the entire time she was at the hospital and that when she \nwas returned to the jail, she was again strip searched.6  Exhibit C at 144-145.  Plaintiff \nMumpower does not allege that her arrest was unlawful.  She was convicted of the public \nintoxication charge.  Exhibit Cat 128-129. \nThis plaintiff testified at deposition that her first memory of being in the Shelby \nCounty jail was sitting in a chair with her right hand handcuffed to the chair. Exhibit Cat 29. \nShe stated that her husband told her she swung at him, but that she does not remember this. \nExhibit C at 38. \n5Plaintiff testified that she does not remember if the handcuffs were completely removed \nor not while she was changing.  Exhibit C at 66. \n6According to defendants, plaintiff was taken to Shelby Baptist Medical Center for \ntreatment for a broken nose.  Defendants' facts at 7. \n4 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 5 of 14(cid:10)\nB. Plainti~f Grauel \nPlaintiff Grauel alleges that she was arrested for DUI by the Shelby County Sheriffs \nDepartment on August 31, 1997.  Plaintiffs' brief at 2; Affidavit of Dennis Blackerby, \nsubmitted as Exhibit A to defendants' memorandum.  This plaintiff was also taken to the \nShelby County Jail where she was also told to strip nude. ld.  She alleges that she was told \nto squat in front of a mirror and cough twice. ld.; affidavit of plaintiff, submitted as Exhibit \n5 to plaintiffs' brief.  This strip search was done in front of Officer Georgiana Smith. \nPlaintiffs' brief at 3. Plaintiff Grauel does not allege she was unlawfully arrested. She plead \nguilty to the DUI charge.  Depo. of Grauel at 40 and 63,  submitted as Exhibit B to \ndefendants' memorandum.  This plaintiff also does not allege any inappropriate comments \non the part of the Shelby County Sheriffs Office. \nIII.  STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is proper \"if the \npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the \naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact that the moving \nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 \n(1986).  As the Supreme Court has explained the summary judgment standard: \n[T]he plain language of Rule 56( c) mandates the entry of summary \njudgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party \nwho fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element \nessential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of \nproof at trial.  In such a situation, there can be no genuine issue as to any \nmaterial fact,  since the complete failure of proof concerning an essential \nelement of the non-moving party's case necessarily renders all other facts \nimmaterial. \n5 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 6 of 14(cid:10)\nCelotex Corp.,  477 U.S. at 322-23.  The party asking for summary judgment always bears \nthe initial responsibility of infonning the court of the basis for its motion and identifying \nthose portions of the pleadings or filings which it believes demonstrates the absence of \ngenuine issues of material fact.  Id. at 323.  The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party \nto \"go beyond the pleadings and by ...  affidavits, or by the  'depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a \ngenuine issue for trial.'\"  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, Fed. R. Civ. Pro 56(e).  In meeting this \nburden the nonmoving party \"must do more than simply show that there is a metaphysical \ndoubt as to the material facts.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. \n574, 586 (1986).  That party must demonstrate that there is a \"genuine issue for trial.\" \nFed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.  The \nnon-movant must \"demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact precluding \nsummary judgment.\" Clark v.  Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604,608 (11th Cir.1991).  A \nfactual  dispute  regarding  a non-material  issue will  not preclude  the  defendant  from \nsucceeding on a motion for summary judgment. Brown v. American Honda Motor Co., 939 \nF .2d 946, 953 (11  Cir.1991). \nth \nOn motions for summary judgment, the court is to construe the evidence and factual \ninferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Adickes \nv. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970). The substantive law will identify which facts \nare material and which are irrelevant.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 \n(1986). All \"reasonable doubts\" about the facts and all justifiable inferences are resolved in \nfavor of the non-movant. Fitzpatrickv. CityofAtlanta,2F.3d 1112,1115 (l1th Cir.1993). \n6 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 7 of 14(cid:10)\nHowever, all \"doubts\" need not be so resolved. Barnes v. Southwest Forest Industries, Inc., \n814 F.2d 607,609 (11th Cir. 1987). \nA dispute is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a \nverdict for the nonmoving party.\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  If the evidence is merely \ncolorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted. Id. at 249. \nThe basic issue before the court on a motion for summary judgment is \"whether the evidence \npresents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one \nsided that one party must prevail as a matter oflaw.\" Holcombe v. Alabama Dry Dock & \nShipbuilding, 1998 WL 758012 (S.D.Ala.); citing Anderson, 47 U.S. at 251-252. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nA. The Strip Searches \nThe plaintiffs contend that defendants' policy for strip searches is unconstitutional and \nhence in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a civil action \nis maintainable for \"deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws.\"  Thus, while the plaintiffs argue that the Sheriff is liable for the \nviolations of plaintiffs' rights because he has \"legal custody and charge of the jail in his \ncounty and all prisoners committed thereto,\" citing § 14-6-1  Alabama Code,1975, as \namended 1996, this court's first inquiry must be whether any rights of the plaintiffs were \nviolated.  See Magill v. Lee County, 990 F.Supp. 1382, 1385, aff'd 161 F.3d 22 (11th Cir. \n1998) (\"In any § 1983 lawsuit, the plaintiff must initially show that she was 'deprived ... of \na right secured under the Constitution or federal law\" in order to recover\"( citations omitted)). \nIf this court finds no violation of rights, then questions ofliability of individual defendants \n7 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 8 of 14(cid:10)\nbecome moot.  Thus, the issue here is whether the Sheriff of Shelby County violated these \nplaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights in strip-searching them upon entry into the Shelby \nCounty Jail.7  The reasonableness of the search and its constitutionality are decided by the \ncourt as a matter oflaw. Justice v. City ofP each tree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11  Cir.1992). \nth \nSee also Magill, 990 F.Supp. at 1387 (\"The court is supposed to balance the legitimate \ninstitutional concerns of security and safety ofthe ... Jail, against the rights of the Plaintiffs, \npre-trial detainees\"). \nThe parties agree that the policy of the Shelby County Sheriff is to strip search all \narrestees who will be placed into the general population.  Plaintiffs' brief at 3 and 4; \ndefendants' statement of undisputed facts (\"defendants' facts\") at 8; depo. of Blankenship, \nsubmitted as Exhibit G to defendants' memorandum at 13-14.  Sheriff Jones testified at \ndeposition that his policy was carried out regardless of whether an individual arrestee was \nsuspected of concealing contraband. Plaintiffs' brief at 4, depo. of Jones at 13-14, submitted \nas Exhibit 8 to plaintiffs' brief.  According to defendants, all female public intoxication or \nDUI arrestees are placed in solitary confinement. According to defendants, the only access \nto this confinement is through the general population.  Defendants' facts at 8. \nIn Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Court \nstated: \n7While the plaintiffs' make various references to \"body cavity\" searches the evidence \nhere clearly establishes that \"body cavity\" searches were not conducted on the plaintiffs, nor are \nthey within the jail policy.  See e.g. Exhibit 9 at 12. \n8 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 9 of 14(cid:10)\nLawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of \nmany privileges  and rights,  a retraction justified by the  considerations \nunderlying our penal system .... \nMaintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and discipline \nare essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of the retained \nconstitutional rights of both convicted persons and pretrial detainees. \nBell, 441 U.S. at 545-546, 99 S.Ct. at 1877-78 (citations omitted) (quoting Price v. Johnston, \n334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1060,92 L.Ed.2d 1356 (1948». The Supreme Court has \nconcluded that strip searches  are  not per se umeasonable and may be performed in \nconformity with the Fourth Amendment on less than probable cause in some instances. \nJustice, 961 F.2d at 191; citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 559-560,99 S.Ct. at 1884-85.  In order to \ndetermine the reasonableness of the search and the instances requiring less than reasonable \ncause, the Supreme Court stated: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of \nprecise definition or mechanical application.  In each case it requires a \nbalancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal \nrights that the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of that particular \nintrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating \nit, and the place in which it is conducted. \nBell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. \nIn this case, both the plaintiffs were searched subject to lawful arrests and prior to \nbeing walked through the general population to reach solitary confinement.  Both plaintiffs \nwere told to undress, squat and cough and then redress in the jail jumpsuit in front of a same \nsex deputy. Plaintiff Mumpower alleges that this was done in a small room; plaintiff Grauel \nalleges that she was in a bathroom with a mirror.  In either case, the plaintiffs do not allege \n9 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 10 of 14(cid:10)\nthat anyone other than the female deputy could see them undress.  They do not allege that \nthey were wrongfully touched.  The defendants' justification for all arrestees entering the \ngeneral population being required to undress in front of an officer is that they have no means \nfor guessing at which arrestee mayor may not be carrying concealed contraband such as \ndrugs or weapons. \nAs the plaintiffs admit, in Bell, the United States Supreme Court upheld an automatic \nstrip search policy.  Plaintiffs' brief at 9.  In Bell, the Court stated that \"maintaining \ninstitutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that may \nrequire limitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of ... detainees.\" Justice, \n961 F.2d at 192; citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1878 ('pre-trial detainees 'simply \ndo not possess the full range of freedoms of an unincarcerated individual. ''').  Although \nplaintiffs rely heavily on Justice v.  Peachtree,  the court in that case ruled that \"law \nenforcement officers may conduct a strip search of a juvenile in custody, even for a minor \noffense, based on reasonable suspicion to believe that the juvenile is concealing weapons or \ncontraband.\" Justice, 961 F.2d at 192. \nThe issue before this court is virtually identical to that facing the court in Magill, \nsupra.  There,  the  court  ruled  that  \"this  court  has  little  difficulty  sustaining  the \nconstitutionality of the searches.  The ... Sheriff has undertaken only to conduct a limited \nstrip search on all newly-incarcerated persons at the Jail, only those who will be placed in \na cell.\" Magill, 990 F.Supp. at 1389. \nThe newly-admitted detainees in this case are in a similar position to the \ninmates in Bell. Neither is yet convicted of a crime, but both are entering (or \n10 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 11 of 14(cid:10)\nreentering) a prison institution after contact with the public. If the searches in \nBell are justified, the searches in this action are justified as well. Furthermore, \nthe detainees in this case are in a position to pose greater danger to the \ninstitution than was the detainee in Peachtree City There, the juvenile was not \neven going to be placed into contact with the inmate population, yet the search \nwas sustained.... This court would analogously note that the security dangers \nposed to the Lee County Jail are as high for one inmate as for another, no \nmatter the crime they are charged with .... the inmates who might at first glance \nappear to pose the least threat may in fact pose the greatest because of their \nfear and potential threat to themselves.  Searches of all newly-admitted \ndetainees who are going to be locked-up and in contact with other prisoners, \nare justified. \nMagill, 990 F.Supp. at 1389-1390 ..C t. 1817, 1825,36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).8  The plaintiff \ncites no cases from this Circuit where a strip search policy such as the one at issue here has \nbeen held to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. \nIn consideration of all of the foregoing, this court finds that the strip searches \nconducted on the plaintiffs did not violate any rights the plaintiffs had under the Fourth \nAmendment. As such, this court is of the opinion that the defendants' motion for summary \njudgment on the plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C.  § 1983  claim, concerning the plaintiffs' Fourth \nAmendment rights is due to be granted and the same be and hereby is GRANTED. \n8The plaintiffs argue that an exception should have been made because \"we are talking \nabout nice women.  We are talking about talking about mothers.  We are talking about two \nupwardly mobile young ladies, with husbands, and children, who have spotless records .... They \nare not bums. They are not drug addicts. They are honest, forthright, godfearing, U.S. citizens.\" \nPlaintiffs' brief at 8-9.  Apparently, plaintiffs ask this court to rule that strip searches of alien \natheist drug abusers are fine and that searches should be based on such statuses as social class, \nreligion, lack if children and nationality.  This court can think of nothing more abhorrent. \nPlaintiffs also allege in their brief that they had spotless records.  Plaintiffs' brief at 9.  This is an \napparent misstatement as both plaintiffs stated in their depositions that they had a prior arrest \neach. \n11 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 12 of 14(cid:10)\nThe court finding that the strip searches were not a violation of the plaintiffs' \nconstitutional rights and having ruled in defendants' favor on this issue, this court does not \nneed to address the defendants' argument that they have qualified immunity concerning this \nclaim of plaintiffs. \nB. Tile State Law Claims \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs' state law claims for invasion of privacy and \noutrageous conduct are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.9 The plaintiffs do not \ndevelop these state law claims in their brief.  However, the Eleventh Circuit has provided \nample direction on the question of sovereign immunity. \nIn McMillian v. Johnson, 101 F.3d 1363 (lIth Cir.1996), the court reviewed the issue \nof immunity under Alabama law.  The Court stated: \nBut a recent decision by this Court,  Tinny v.  Shores,  77  F.3d 378 (11th \nCir.1996), holds that under Alabama law a sheriff and deputy sheriff are \nshielded by sovereign immunity against claims based on intentional torts .... \n[T]he holding of the case is clear: under Alabama law, a claim against an \nAlabama sheriff in his  individual  capacity is  barred by the  doctrine  of \nsovereign immunity. We are bound to follow Tinny, and do so. \nMcMillian\" 101 F.3d at 1365.  Furthermore, in Alexander v.  Hatfield, 625 So.2d 1142, \n1144(Ala.1994), the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that deputy sheriffs are immune from suit \nto the same extent as sheriffs. This court can find no possible theory ofliability for state law \nAlthough the plaintiffs' complaint refers to \"outrageous conduct\" this court assumes that \n9 \nthe plaintiffs' are attempting to state a claim for the tort of outrage. \n12 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 13 of 14(cid:10)\nviolations anywhere except the undeveloped allegations of plaintiffs' complaint. 10  As such, \nthe court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to present any substantial evidence that either \nof these intentional torts were committed.  However, even if the court could find facts \nsupporting these allegations, the defendants are entitled to sovereign immunity under \nAlabama law.  Therefore, the court ORDERS that the defendants' motion for summary \njudgment on the plaintiffs' state law claims be and hereby is GRANTED. \nC. Plaintiff Mumpower's Excessive Force Claim \nThe parties are in agreement that after plaintiff was in custody, her nose was broken. \nThe facts  surrounding how the plaintiff s nose got broken are very much in dispute. \nDefendant Blankenship alleges that the plaintiff took a swing at her. Exhibit 9 to plaintiffs' \nbrief at 22, 27 (describing an altercation started by the plaintiff in which the two deputies \nwere trying to restrain her).  However, plaintiff states she was intentionally shoved into a \nconcrete wall. Exhibit Cat 55; Exhibit 0 at 54. The parties agree that the plaintiff was taken \nto a hospital emergency room for treatment for a broken nose.  The hospital records were \nsubmitted to the court at oral argument. Additionally, according to Deputy Blankenship, the \nplaintiff was not handcuffed at this time. Exhibit 9 at 20.  According to the plaintiff, she was \nhandcuffed at this time.  Exhibit Cat 62. \nlOPlaintiffs argue that the Sheriff of Shelby County can be liable for the existence of an \nimproper policy.  Plaintiffs' brief at 5.  However, this argument is addressed to alleged \nconstitutional violations by the sheriff, and not to plaintiffs' state law claims.  Because the \nplaintiffs' failed to develop their state law claims, this court assumes that the allegations of \ninvasion of privacy and outrage are based on the strip searches as this is the logical analysis of \nthe state law claims. Because this court has found nothing improper in Sheriff Jones' policy of \nstrip searching all detainees, this court fmds no improper policy. \n13 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-01097-IPJ     Document 65     Filed 04/14/1999     Page 14 of 14(cid:10)\nThe court finds that because genuine issues of material fact exist regarding plaintiff \nMumpower's claim for excessive force, it is inappropriate for summary judgment.  In \nconsideration oft he foregoing, the court ORDERS that the defendants' motion for summary \njudgment on the plaintiffs' claim for excessive force be and hereby is DENIED. \nv. CONCLUSION \nIn consideration of the foregoing, the Court finding that the defendants are entitled to \nsummary judgment in their favor on all counts of plaintiffs' complaint except for plaintiff \nMumpower's claim for excessive force; \nIt is therefore ORDERED by the court that the defendant's motion for summary \njudgment on all claims ofp laintiff Grauel be and hereby are GRANTED.  The court finding \nno just cause for delay, this judgment is hereby made final as a matter of law pursuant to \nRule 54(b), F.R.C.P. \nIt is further ORDERED by the court that the defendant's motion for summary \njudgment  on  plaintiff Mumpower's  state  law  claims  and  her  Fourth  Amendment \nunreasonable search claim be and hereby is GRANTED. \nThe court finding genuine issues ofm  aterial fact remaining on plaintiff Mumpower' s \nclaim for excessive force, the defendant's motion for summary judgment on this issue be and \nhereby is DENIED. \n/{# \nDONE and ORDERED this the  day of April, 1999. \n14 ",
