    "summary": "<p>This case, Maryland NAACP v. Baltimore City Police Department, 1:06-cv-01863-CCB (D. Md. 2006) was one of three cases filed about the same time alleging mistreatment of persons arrested and taken to Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center (\"Central Booking\" or \"CBIC\") for booking and processing. (The other cases were <a href=\"../../../../case/9609/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jones v. Murphy,</a> Case No. 1:05-cv-01287-CCB (D. Md. 2005) and <a href=\"../../../../case/9810/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rodney v. Murphy</a>, 24-C-05004405, filed in Maryland state court.) Central Booking was opened in 1995 as the central location for booking and processing arrestees in Baltimore City. Operated by the Maryland Division of Pretrial Detention and Services, part of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, Central Booking processed approximately 100,000 arrestees annually.</p>\r\n<p>This case was a class-action lawsuit filed in the United States District for the District of Maryland on July 21, 2006, by five individuals and two NAACP entities. Represented by the ACLU of Maryland Foundation and private attorneys from New York and Washington, D.C., the plaintiffs alleged that the Baltimore City Police Department engaged in a pattern and practice of illegally arresting tens of thousands of individuals each year who were not and could not be prosecuted. The plaintiffs further alleged that, after being illegally arrested, the individuals were taken to Central Booking where they were strip-searched and detained for days, as long as 54 hours, in inhumane conditions, until they were released without being charged with a crime. This practice, plaintiffs alleged, was encouraged by the Baltimore Police Department, which rewarded officers for high arrest productivity and punished officers with few arrests, regardless of the success of the prosecution. In 2005, 30% of those arrested without a warrant were never charged. The plaintiffs alleged there were illegal arrests for things such as stopping on the street to watch a woman being handcuffed, handing out religious pamphlets, sitting on the steps of a building, dropping a food wrapper, and walking down the street.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought monetary damages, injunctive relief, and certification for a class consisting of \"arrestees who were (1) arrested by the Police Department without probable cause and (2) released without charges after being booked at CBIC.\" The defendants included the City of Baltimore, the Baltimore Police Department, the warden of Central Booking, and other state officials.</p>\r\n<p>The State defendants answered by generally denying the charges. The City and Police Department moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On December 1, 2006, the District Court (District Judge Catherine C. Blake) denied the motion to dismiss. 2006 WL 3626898 (D. Md. Dec 01, 2006).</p>\r\n<p>As discovery progressed, Judge Blake required the parties in this case and Jones v. Murhpy, another pending before her, to provide periodic status reports to the Court. The state defendants produced electronic data pertaining to arrests from 2002--August 2007 and numerous hardcopy documents. The plaintiffs also took the depositions of various officials with the Police Department and Central Booking.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on December 18, 2007, adding 9 individual plaintiffs and several new defendants, including the new Mayor of Baltimore and several police officers. On February 27, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint adding additional plaintiffs and defendants. On April 25, 2008, the plaintiffs moved for class certification.</p>\r\n<p>Following leadership changes at BPD, the parties entered into settlement negotiations, which culminated in settlement agreement to end the lawsuit. On June 29, 2010, the parties reached a settlement agreement that was approved by the court. The comprehensive settlement provided for significant reforms of the BPD's arrest and monitoring practices and the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement for three years. The BPD committed to new policies and training to ensure officers knew the limits of their authority, and would address low level offenses with actions short of arrest whenever possible. The defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $630,000 in damages and attorneys' fees. The agreement also required the BPD to implement a new system of comprehensive data collection and monitoring, which would be overseen by an independent auditor. The job of the auditor was to ensure not only that the data is being kept and appropriately used and analyzed, but also to review probable cause statements to verify that officers had sufficient cause for an arrest, and that supervisors are adequately monitoring officers' actions, and intervening as necessary. The auditor's reports can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.aclu-md.org/our_work/legal_cases/11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACLU's website here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2012, the auditor released his first report and the plaintiffs alleged in a <a href=\"http://www.aclu-md.org/press_room/66\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release</a> that the BPD had failed to comply with the settlement agreement. The plaintiffs stated that the status report revealed that BPD officers did not or could not justify arrests for quality of life offenses in at least 35 percent of the cases examined; that the BPD was almost one and half years late in creating a database to allow it to effectively monitor officer and supervisor behavior; and that the BPD was improperly refusing to give the auditor records of arrests that resulted in persons being released without charge, the very arrests most likely to be improper, and the ones that led to the lawsuit in the first place. The docket sheet does not reveal any plaintiffs' motion regarding this alleged noncompliance with the settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>For the next three years, the auditor continued to file report documenting the defendants' implementation of the settlement agreement. The auditor filed his final report in 2015. The case is now closed.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under a pattern and practice set and enforced by city officials, Baltimore police \nofficers arrest individuals without probable cause, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights. \n2.  To encourage this pattern and practice, the Baltimore City Police Department \n(\"Police Department\") rewards police officers with more arrests and punishes officers with fewer \narrests, regardless of the number or success of resulting prosecutions. \n2 \n\n3.  As a consequence, Baltimore prosecutors decided to drop the charges against \napproximately 30 percent of those arrested without a warrant in 200S prior to any involvement \nby a defense attorney, and prior to review of the charges by a Court Commissioner. \n4.  The Maryland Central Booking and Intake Center (\"CBIC\") receives these \narrestees for processing, and compounds the problem by conducting strip searches of male \narrestees without probable cause or individualized suspicion that they are carrying weapons or \ncontraband, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \nS.  The volume of arrests by the Police Department has caused CBIC to detain many \narrestees beyond the statutory time limit of 24 hours before presentment or release, in violation \nof Maryland Rule 4-212(f) and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.  In some cases, the \ndetentions have exceeded 48 hours, in violation of the U.S. Constitution. \n6.  These unconstitutional and illegal acts degrade, humiliate, and cause grave harm \nto their victims.  Individuals who are arrested suffer unwarranted deprivation of personal liberty, \nsometimes for days.  They may lose their jobs or be denied job opportunities in the future as a \nresult of the permanent stigma of having a criminal charge on their record.  They suffer the \nhumiliation of being hauled away in handcuffs in front of friends, family, or neighbors.  At \nCBIC, they are subjected to the degradation of strip searches-in many cases, visual body cavity \nsearches-in front of other detainees.  They are detained, sometimes for days at a time, in fithly, \novercrowded conditions.  Then, when the States' Attorney declines to prosecute, they are \nReleased Without Charge (RWQC'd), though they have technically already been charged by the \npolice-often because the police had no right to arrest them in the first place. \n7.  Despite the patently unconstitutional and illegal nature of this conduct and its \ndetrimental effects on the Baltimore residents whom the laws are supposed to protect, city \n3 \n\nofficials have refused to reform their practices.  The time has come to rein in this abuse of power \nand stop these unconstitutional and illegal acts. \nII.  JURISDICTION \n8.  This Circuit Court has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over this case because \neach individual Plaintiff claims damages in excess of $25,000. \n9.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants State of Maryland (\"State\"), \nthe Mayor and City Council of the City of Baltimore (\"City\"), and the Police Department \nbecause they are entities consisting of or located within Maryland. \n10.  This Court also has personal jurisdiction over individual Defendants Saar, Smith, \nFranks, Murphy, O'Malley, Hamm, Brown, Clark, Norris, lemini lones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, \nArnold lones, Does A-F, and Does 1-100.

The Experiences of the Individual Plaintiffs \n1.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton \n45.  At approximately 8:30 p.m. on Friday, April 15, 2005, Plaintiff Evan Howard was \nstanding on the sidewalk that runs past his home on Poplar Grove Street in Baltimore, about a \nblock away from his front door, engaging in conversation with Plaintiff Tyrone Braxton and \nanother friend, Correy Alexander. \n46.  After a few minutes, Defendant Officers Jemini Jones and Doe 1 pulled up behind \nBraxton's car in an unmarked police cruiser.  The plainclothes officers approached the three \nfriends and asked if they had any information about a recent homicide. \n12 \n\n47.  The officers then asked Howard, Braxton, and Alexander their ages.  After \nrevealing that he was a minor, Alexander was ordered to go home, which he did. \n48.  Then, without explanation, probable cause, or any legal justification, the officers \nconducted pat-down searches of Howard and Braxton and placed them under arrest.  The arrests \nwere purportedly for loitering and impeding the flow of pedestrian traffic, even though neither \nHoward nor Braxton had been loitering and the officers had not ordered them to disperse. \n49.  Officer Jemini Jones tightly bound the young men's hands with plastic handcuffs \nand placed Howard and Braxton in a vehicle for transport to CBIC. \n50.  Howard and Braxton arrived at CBIC at about 10:00 p.m., where they waited for \napproximately an hour to begin the booking process.  Upon entering CBIC, they were screened \nwith a metal detector, which showed that neither carried any weapons. \n51.  At approximately 11 :00 p.m., Howard and Braxton were subjected to humiliating \npublic strip-searches by Defendant Officers Doe A and Doe B.  Howard, Braxton, and two other \ndetainees were placed in a holding cell, ordered to remove all of their clothing down to their \nunderpants, face the wall, pull their underpants down to expose their buttocks, and submit to a \nvisual body cavity search. \n52.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat either Howard or Braxton was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n53.  Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Howard or Braxton \nduring the search. \n54.  After the strip search, Howard and Braxton were taken to a small, filthy, and \novercrowded cell, where they stayed with about ten other detainees through the night.  The cell \n13 \n\nhad no bathroom and was so overcrowded that both Howard and Braxton were forced to sit in \nuncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time. \n55.  At approximately 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, April 16, Howard and Braxton were \ntaken to a slightly larger cell containing about fifteen other detainees.  This cell was also filthy \nand unsanitary.  Throughout the day, the number of people in the cell fluctuated, frequently \nswelling to nearly twenty.  Once again, both Howard and Braxton were forced to sit in \nuncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time. \n56.  During their confinement, Howard and Braxton were provided \"meals\" in their \ncells three times each day.  The meals principally consisted of two slices of bread covering shiny \nand slimy meat, which Howard and Braxton believed to be spoiled bologna. \n57.  Braxton was finally released on Sunday, April 17, at 10:00 a.m., after being held \nat CBIC for 36 hours. \n58.  Howard was finally released on Monday, April 18, at 4:00 a.m., after being held \nat CBIC for 54 hours.  Howard, far from home and unable to contact anyone to pick him up from \nCBIC, was forced to walk back to his home in the dark at a dangerous hour of night through \nunfamiliar streets. \n59.  Neither Howard nor Braxton was ever prosecuted for any crime or ever brought \nbefore a court commissioner. \n2.  The Illegal Arrest and Search of Plaintiff Wilson \n60.  On April 10,2006, Plaintiff Donald 'Vilson was sitting on the front steps of a \nresidence in which his girlfriend and toddler son live.  He was visiting them and waiting for his \nyounger brother, Darrell. \n14 \n\n61.  While Mr. Wilson was sitting on the steps with two friends, an unmarked police \nSubaru raced down the street in pursuit of a dirt bike.  A crowd of approximately 15 neighbors \ngathered along the block to watch the chase. \n62.  Failing to catch the bicyclist, the maroon police Subaru pulled up to the residence \nand Officer Crites and Sergeant Pecha exited the vehicle.  Officer Crites, yelled, \"Everybody sit \nthe f**k down!\"  Everyone in the area obeyed.  Wilson, at the time, was already sitting down. \n63.  The officers began questioning the group of people, asking them where they lived \nand what they were doing there.  Most were patted down and asked to show identification. \nWilson provided his identification when requested. \n64.  Crites questioned Wilson and asked whether Wilson lived there.  When Wilson \nfirmly responded in the affirmative, Crites took offense and, in a low tone of voice, threatened to \n\"f**k [him] up.\" \n65.  When Wilson responded to this threat, by observing that Crites had whispered his \nthreat rather than stating it aloud in front of witnesses, Crites immediately ordered Wilson to \nstand up.  Wilson asked why, and Crites responded, \"Don't f**king say nothing to me,\" and \nordered Wilson to stand up and put his hands behind his back. \n66.  Wilson complied and asked why he was being arrested.  Crites responded, \"Don't \nworry about it.  You're going to jail.\" \n67.  Wilson asked Crites for his name and badge number.  Crites replied, \"911.\" \n68.  Crites placed metal handcuffs on Wilson and ordered him to sit on the ground.  At \nthat time, two marked police cruisers arrived at the scene, and two additional officers exited \nthose vehicles. \n15 \n\n69.  Wilson asked his girlfriend to call his mother, and then he remained calm and \nquiet. \n70.  The police began to tell people to leave.  After about 15 minutes, Wilson's mother \narrived.  She politely asked who the officer in charge was.  Sgt. Pecha responded that he was in \ncharge.  Wilson's mother asked what her son was being detained for.  Pecha asked for Wilson's \nage, and when his mother said, \"21,\" Pecha stated that he did not have to give her any \ninformation because Wilson was not a minor.  Upon further questioning, Pecha continued to \nrefuse to explain why Wilson was arrested. \n71.  She therefore went to talk with her son, who explained what had happened.  After \nabout two minutes, Pecha came over and told her that she had to leave or she would be arrested. \nWhen she asked for Pecha's name and badge number, Pecha ignored her. \n72.  Crites and Pecha did not have nametags on and their badges were tucked inside \ntheir shirts to hide identifying information. \n73.  Crites put Wilson in the police car and transported him to CBIC at approximately \n9:15 p.m. \n74.  At CBIC, Wilson was taken to a waiting room, where he was ordered to strip \ndown to his boxers and searched by Does C-D.  A Latino man next to him in the same room was \ncompletely naked. \n75.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion that \nWilson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  Indeed, no contraband was found in his \nposseSSIOn. \n16 \n\n76.  Wilson was finally released from CBIC at around 2:00 a.m. the next morning.  He \nwas not allowed to use a phone at CBIC, so he walked to the nearest pay phone to call his \nmother. \n77.  Wilson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommISSIoner. \n3.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Stoner and Lowery \n78.  On May 7,2005, Plaintiff Aaron Stoner, Plaintiff Robert Lowery, Walter Medina, \nJr., and four other friends and co-workers visited the city of Baltimore to celebrate Stoner's \nupcoming wedding.  After visiting the Inner Harbor, the group of friends left on foot in the early \nmorning hours of May 8 to return to their hotel. \n79.  While walking back to their hotel, a marked police car containing Defendant \nOfficers Newkirk and Arnold Jones drove past.  Newkirk instructed the group to \"keep moving,\" \neven though the group had not actually paused during the journey.  They obeyed and continued \nto walk back to their hotel. \n80.  About two minutes later, the same patrol car drove past the group.  Medina was \nthe first to see the approaching car, and remarked to Stoner, \"Here comes that cop again.\" \n81.  Officer Newkirk pulled the car to the side, stopped the car, and exited.  Newkirk \nconfronted Medina, the only African-American in the group, demanding, \"What did you say, \nboy?\"  Before Medina could answer, Newkirk pushed him against a wall. \n82.  After Newkirk pushed Medina against the wall and began to aggressively \nquestion him, Stoner verbally protested.  Newkirk then turned toward Stoner and ran at him with \nhis baton fortifying his raised forearm.  Defendant Newkirk hit Stoner with such force as to \nknock Stoner off of his feet. \n17 \n\n83.  Newkirk then instructed Stoner and the other five men to \"keep walking.\"  Stoner \nobeyed by getting up and walking to the rest of the group. \n84.  Newkirk then issued a warning citation for loitering to Medina. \n85.  Lowery, upset at the police harassment and brutality he had witnessed, then left \nthe group, approached Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones, and asked for Newkirk's name and \nbadge number. \n86.  Newkirk refused to answer Lowery's question, but Defendant Arnold Jones \nresponded by placing Lowery under arrest, purportedly for \"failure to obey\" an order to cease \nloitering.  This arrest was made without probable cause or legal justification. \n87.  Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones then drove Lowery down the block to where \nStoner, having obeyed Newkirk's earlier order to \"keep walking,\" was walking with his party. \nThe officers then arrested Stoner as well. \n88.  Stoner's arrest was also purportedly for \"failure to obey\" an order to cease \nloitering.  This arrest was made without probable cause or legal justification. \n89.  Stoner and Lowery were both subjected to pat-down searches, which revealed \nthey were carrying no contraband or weapons. \n90.  Medina, who had been issued a warning citation for loitering, and the other four \nmembers of the original group were permitted to continue walking back to the hotel. \n91.  Stoner and Lowery were transported to CBIC, where they were processed and \nsubjected to another pat-down search that revealed them to be free of contraband and weapons. \n92.  Despite the negative results of the searches, Defendant Corrections Officers Doe \nE and Doe F subjected Stoner and Lowery to humiliating public strip searches at CBIC. \n18 \n\n93.  Stoner and Lowery, along with two other detainees, were ordered to strip to their \nunderpants while the officers conducted the search. \n94.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat either Stoner or Lowery was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n95.  Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Stoner or Lowery \nduring the search. \n96.  Both Stoner and Lowery were held in small, filthy, and overcrowded cells that \nwere packed with other detainees.  Both Stoner and Lowery were forced to sit or crouch in \nuncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time because of the overcrowded \nconditions. \n97.  Stoner and Lowery were released from CBIC at approximately 8:00 p.m. on May \n8, after being detained for 17 hours. \n98.  Neither Stoner nor Lowery was ever prosecuted for any crime or brought before a \ncourt commissioner. \nB.  The Police Department's Illegal Practices \n99.  The experiences of these individual plaintiffs are not unique.  They stem from a \nbroader policy and practice by the Police Department of arresting persons without probable \ncause in order to satisfy performance goals and to show progress in fighting crime by means of \nhigh arrest numbers. \n100.  Under the direction and oversight of the Commissioner and Deputy \nCommissioner, the Police Department has used a \"performance evaluation system\" that demands \nthat officers make a large number of arrests, regardless of the number or success of resulting \nprosecutions.  Each patrol officer is required to tally his enforcement statistics, including \ncitations and arrests.  These numbers are then compared to averages from that officer's squad \n19 \n\nand shift.  The three officers in each district with the lowest scores are subject to reassignment to \nother districts. \n101.  Police officers generally disfavor reassignment because it can greatly disrupt their \npersonal and professional lives. \n102.  Upon information and belief, the Police Department has a policy by which no \nautomatic disciplinary action is taken against a police officer if a plaintiff succeeds in a civil case \nchallenging the conduct of the officer. \nI 03.  Upon information and belief the Police Department has no practice of reviewing \narrests to see whether they result in successful prosecutions, nor of reviewing arrest reports in \nthose cases that are not prosecuted to determine whether officers had sufficient probable cause \nfor the arrest or charge. \n104.  These policies create perverse incentives for police officers by rewarding those \nofficers who arrest innocent bystanders and punishing those who respect their obligations to the \nCity and the public. \nI 05.  These perverse incentives are unavoidable because, under the \"performance \nevaluation system,\" all arrests are counted-even those made with no basis for probable cause. \n106.  Thus, under this system, an officer will not be reassigned even if every single one \nof his arrests is made without probable cause, so long as his volume of arrests is not among the \nthree lowest in his district.  By contrast, a different officer whose volume of arrests is the third \nlowest in his district will be reassigned even if all of his arrestees were convicted. \n107.  The system therefore encourages all officers to make as many arrests as possible, \nregardless of their justification, to avoid transfer. \n20 \n\n108.  As confirmation, State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy stated at a public legislative \nhearing on January 4, 2006, that the Police Department routinely and increasingly arrests people \nwithout probable cause. \n109.  To exacerbate matters, the Police Department, its Commissioner, its Deputy \nCommissioner, the Mayor, and the City, which all are (and were, at all times relevant to this \nlawsuit) aware of the Police Department's pattern and practice of illegal arrests, have failed to \ntake adequate steps to abate the pattern and practice,. despite their authority to do so.  They have \nfailed to train and supervise police officers adequately.  They have not properly encouraged \narrests based on probable cause.  They have affirmatively encouraged overly aggressive and \nunlawful police tactics, by directing supervisors to ensure that officers keep arrest numbers up, in \nthe belief that a high number of arrests will keep the crime rate down, regardless of the quality of \nthose arrests.  In short, they have made the unconstitutional and illegal conduct worse. \nC.  Grading the Police Department \n110.  Due to the policies and practices described above, the Baltimore Police \nDepartment has severe police accountability problems. \n111.  Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office Annual Statistical Reports indicate that, \nin 2005, the Police Department arrested 76,497 individuals without warrants.  Prosecutors \ndeclined to charge 25,293 of the arrestees.  Thus, during 2005, three out of every ten people \narrested without warrants in Baltimore City were not prosecuted, based solely on a review of \nthe charging documents by the State's Attorney, prior to any involvement by a defense attorney \nor any decision by a court commissioner or judge.  The State's Attorney has publicly stated that \nprosecutors declined to charge about 30% of the arrestees in 2005 because, in the State's view, \nthe case was \"legally insufficient.\" \n21 \n\n112.  In 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against 7,510 \npeople arrested for loitering, impeding, or obstructing pedestrian traffic during that year.  Those \narrests account for nearly 10% of all warrantless arrests in Baltimore for that year. \n113.  During 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against \n1,832 persons arrested for trespassing and 1,650 persons arrested for disorderly conduct/failure \nto obey/disturbing the peace.  Together, these arrests account for nearly another 5% of all \nwarrantless arrests in Baltimore for that year. \n114.  Thus, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against those \npersons arrested for often vague \"quality of life\" offenses in 2005, which amounted to nearly \n15% of the persons arrested without a warrant during that year. \nD.  The Effects of the Police Department's Arrest Policy on CBIC \n115.  The Police Department's pattern and practice of encouraging large numbers of \nillegal arrests causes a backlog at CBIC that leads CBIC to perform unconstitutional strip \nsearches and to subject arrestees to overcrowded conditions and extended detentions. \n116.  CBIC was designed to handle about 60,000 bookings each year and to \naccommodate 895 arrestees at anyone time.  Because of the Police Department's arrest policies, \nit now handles more than 100,000 bookings each year and regularly holds more than 1,200 \narrestees at anyone time.  Defendant Smith has characterized the problems at CBIC as a \n\"systems overload.\"  The overcrowding at CBIC has led to two distinct problems. \n117.  First, CBIC regularly subjects all male arrestees to public strip searches, without \nindividualized suspicion and regardless of the arrestees' charges.  Often, these strip searches are \nhumiliating, non-private body cavity searches.  Most of these searches are not reasonably related \nto any legitimate security interest or to any reasonable suspicion of concealed contraband. \n22 \n\n118.  Second, the backlog causes CBIC to delay, in some cases, presentment of \narrestees beyond the twenty-four hour maximum established in Maryland Rule 4-212(f).  In \nsome cases, detainees have been held at CBIC more than forty-eight hours before presentment. \nCBIC makes no adequate effort to structure its systems so that it can timely process all detainees \neven though CBIC officials are aware of its deficiencies.  Indeed, a consultant's report to the \nState in October 2005 stated that \"no one [is] in charge\" of ensuring the prompt processing of \ndetainees at CBIC. \n119.  The Warden, Commissioner of Pretrial Services, Secretary, and State condone, \naffirmatively encourage, or knowingly fail to address these two policies and practices at CBIC, \ndespite their responsibility to address them through proper training, supervising, monitoring, and \ndisciplining of staff or through the formulating, implementing, and executing of appropriate \npolicies. \nE.  The Effects of the Police Department's Arrest Policy on the Arrestees. \n120.  These illegal arrests, searches, and detentions traumatize arrestees. \n121.  Individuals who are illegally arrested suffer humiliation and degradation when \nthey are being dragged away in handcuffs in front of their friends, family, or neighbors.  The \nstigma of being illegally arrested can follow an arrestee for years, in part because those who \nknow an arrestee are unlikely to forget the sight of the arrestee being hauled away in handcuffs \nin the back of a police car. \n122.  At CBIC, innocent arrestees are subjected to dehumanizing and humiliating \npublic strip searches that involve stripping down to underwear, pulling down the underwear, \nand-often-submitting to a visual body cavity search.  The searches are performed in public \nview and alongside other detainees.  The victims of such unwarranted invasions of privacy are \nhumiliated, degraded, and stigmatized. \n23 \n\n123.  An individual who is arrested is often physically harmed or threatened while \ndetained at CBIC.  And the threat does not just come from other arrestees.  In May 2005, a \ndetainee was beaten to death by guards at the CBIC.  In the wake of that incident, eight CBIC \nguards were fired and the FBI has opened an investigation.  The detainee's death was classified \nas a homicide. \n124.  While detained at CBIC, an arrestee is held in filthy and overcrowded conditions \nwith numerous other arrestees.  Cells are often so crowded that arrestees are forced to sleep on \nthe floor.  In some cases, the cells are so crowded that inmates must sit or crouch in \nuncomfortable positions on unsanitary floors for hours at a time.  The \"meals\" are inedible. \n125.  An individual who is illegally arrested also suffers the loss of his liberty for hours \nor days.  Such detention can result in a detainee losing his job when he fails to appear at work \nand may also harm relations with family if an individual is unable to meet family obligations \nwhile illegally detained. \n126.  The presence of an arrest record, even if the arrestee is \"released without charge,\" \ncan follow an individual for years, making it difficult to obtain jobs, housing, or any other \nopportunity that may require a criminal background check. \n127.  Moreover, it is virtually impossible for an arrestee to get the record of his arrest \nexpunged unless he either (a) waives his right to sue the City or State entities responsible for his \narrest and detention or (b) brings a lawsuit against the City or State-a process that can take \nyears and can cost thousands of dollars.  Thus, these illegal arrests force arrestees into a \nHobson's choice of either submitting to the illegal arrest or being saddled with an arrest record \nthat can eliminate professional opportunities for years. \n24 \n\n128.  For confinned criminals, the prospect of spending hours or days in Central \nBooking, while unpleasant, is a cost of doing business, and does nothing to deter them from their \nunlawful behavior or to make Baltimore safer.  For innocent victims of these arrest practices, \nhowever, being unlawfully arrested can be a life-changing event. \nF.  The City's and the Police Department's Response \n129.  Despite these stories and statistics, the City and Police Department make no \napologies. \n130.  In response to repeated and persistent complaints by public officials, Baltimore \ncommunity leaders, and community groups with regard to this ongoing pattern of unlawful \narrests, the City and the Police Department have consistently refused to acknowledge that a \nproblem exists. \n131.  Moroever, Mayor and Defendant O'Malley has consistently refused to \nacknowledge that such a problem exists. \n132.  At a community forum designed to address police practices on January 4,2006, \nMayor and Defendant O'Malley proposed eliminating oversight by the State's Attorney's Office \nof individuals arrested by the Police Department. \n133.  Eliminating the oversight by the State's Attorney's Office would obviously fail to \nhave any effect on the number of illegal arrests.  Such a proposal would succeed at one thing, \nhowever - it would hide from the public the thousands of illegal arrests made by the Police \nDepartment without probable cause. \n25 \n\nVII.  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n134.  Pursuant to Rule 2-231 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, Plaintiffs Howard, \nBraxton, Wilson, Stoner, and Lowery move the Court to declare and certify a class of \nindividuals, as described below. \n135.  The class is composed of arrestees who were (1) arrested by the Police \nDepartment without probable cause and (2) released without charges after being booked at \nCBIC.  The class seeks injunctive, declaratory, and other equitable relief only. \n136.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members would be impracticable. \nMore than 21,000 individuals were arrested and released without charges after booking in \nBaltimore during the period from April 2004 to March 2005 alone.  Upon information and belief, \nmost of these 21,000 individuals were arrested without probable cause.  Joinder of thousands of \nclass members would be impracticable. \n137.  Numerous questions of law and fact are common to the class, including the \nfollowing: \na.  Whether the Police Department has a policy and practice of arresting \npersons without probable cause \nb.  Whether such a policy and practice violates the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Articles 24 and 26 of the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights; \nc.  Whether the Police Department encourages illegal arrests by punishing \nofficers who make fewer arrests than their colleagues or by rewarding \nofficers who make more arrests than their colleagues, regardless of the \noutcome of those arrests; \nd.  Whether such policy violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe U.S. Constitution, and Articles 24 and 26 of the Maryland Declaration \nof Rights; \ne.  Whether Defendants were deliberately indifferent to the rights of \narrestees; and \n26 \n\nf.  What nature and scope of equitable relief is warranted by Defendants' \nconduct. \n138.  The claims of the individual Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class.  Each \nof the individual Plaintiffs was (1) arrested by the Police Department without probable cause and \n(2) released without charges after being booked at CBIC. \n139.  The individual Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nmembers of the class and have retained counsel who are competent and experienced in complex \nclass action and civil rights litigation.  The Plaintiffs have no interests that are contrary to or that \nconflict with those of the class. \n140.  Defendants the State, Secretary Saar., Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, the \nCity, the Police Department, Mayor O'Malley, Commissioner Hamm, and Deputy Commissioner \nBrown have acted or refused to act on grounds that are generally applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole. \n141.  The Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management \nof this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action, and the class action is \nsuperior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the class. \nVIII.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nA.  Count I: Facial and As Applied Challenge to the Loitering Ordinance under \nthe First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and \nArticles 19, 26, and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \n142.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n143.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, \nLowery, and Stoner and the NAACP against the City. \n27 \n\n144.  This is an \"as applied\" challenge to the enforcement of the Loitering Ordinance, \nBaltimore, Md., Police Ordinances art. 19, § 25-1 (2005).  In the alternative, it is a facial \nchallenge to the Loitering Ordinance itself. \n145.  The Police Department has interpreted the Loitering Ordinance incorrectly to \nallow arrests of persons engaged in no wrongdoing merely for standing on the public sidewalks. \nBy arresting persons merely for standing, the Police Department has effectuated a policy of \narrests without probable cause that a violation of the Loitering Ordinance has occurred in \nu.s. \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment to the  Constitution and Article 26 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights. \n146.  In the alternative, if the Police Department correctly interprets the Loitering \nOrdinance to permit an arrest when an innocent bystander merely is standing on a public \nsidewalk, the Loitering Ordinance is unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Articles 19 and 40 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights. \nB.  Count II: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for \nUnconstitutional Arrests under Section 1983 \n147.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n148.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs, the class, and the NAACP \nagainst the City, Mayor O'Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, Deputy \nCommissioner Brown, Clark, Norris, and Officers lemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold \nlones, and Does 1-100. \n149.  Defendants O'Malley, Hamm, Brown, Clark, Norris, Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, \nNewkirk, Arnold Jones, and Does 1-100 are \"persons\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.c. § 1983. \n28 \n\n150.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of the \nindividual Plaintiffs and of the class members. \n151.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, and Does 1-100 \ndirectly violated the constitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs by arresting them without \nprobable cause and under an illegal pattern and practice. \n152.  The City, Mayor O'Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, \nDeputy Commissioner Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar constitutional \nviolations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice. \n153.  The City, Mayor O'Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, and \nDeputy Commissioner Brown will continue to cause similar constitutional violations by \nimplementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice in the future. \n154.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of their \nactions that the conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violate the Fourth and \nu.s. \nFourteenth Amendments to the  Constitution. \n155.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices, \nPlaintiffs and the class members suffered damages. \n156.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat Plaintiffs, class members, and NAACP members will suffer damages as an actual and \nproximate result of similar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \nC.  Count III: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for \nUnconstitutional Strip Searches under Section 1983 \n157.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n158.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs and the NAACP against \nSecretary Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, Murphy, and Officer Does A-F in their \n29 \n\nindividual capacities.  In addition, Defendants Saar, Smith, and Franks are sued in their official \ncapacity for declaratory and prospective injunctive relief.  These defendants are therefore \n\"persons\" within the meaning of 42 US.c. § 1983. \n159.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of the \nindividual Plaintiffs. \n160.  Officer Does A-F directly violated the constitutional rights of the individual \nPlaintiffs by conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of them, without \nprobable cause or individualized suspicion to believe they possessed weapons or contraband. \n161.  The policy of strip searching, without individualized suspicion, every person \narrested for loitering or other \"quality of life\" offenses is not necessary to protect officer safety, \nto preserve evidence, or to ensure prison security. \n162.  Secretary Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy, with \ndeliberate indifference to the individual Plaintiffs' legal rights, established, implemented, \nenforced, or failed to remedy an illegal and unconstitutional policy and practice at CBIC of \nconducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of persons temporarily detained at \nthe center, without probable cause or individualized suspicion to believe the detainees possessed \nweapons or contraband. \n163.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of their \nactions that the conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violate the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n164.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices, \nthe individual Plaintiffs suffered damages. \n30 \n\n165.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat the individual Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer damages as an actual and \nproximate result of similar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \nD.  Count IV: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for \nUnconstitutional Overdetentions under Section 1983 \n166.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n167.  This Count is brought by Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton against Secretary Saar, \nCommissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy.  In this Count, these Defendants are sued in \ntheir individual capacities only.  They are therefore \"persons\" within the meaning of 42 US.c. § \n1983. \n168.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs Howard and Braxton. \n169.  Secretary Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy, with \ndeliberate indifference to Howard's and Braxton's legal rights, established, implemented, \nenforced, condoned, and failed to remedy the conduct, pattern, and practice at CBIC of holding \ndetainees for more than twenty-four hours without charges, presentment, or release. \n170.  It was clearly established at the time of their actions that such conduct, patterns, \nand practices violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n171.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, pattern, and practice, \nPlaintiffs Howard and Braxton suffered damages. \nE.  Court V: Common Law Claim for Violations of Article 26 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights for Unconstitutional Arrests \n172.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n173.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs, the class, and the NAACP \nagainst the City, Mayor O'Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, Deputy \n31 \n\nCommissioner Brown, Clark, Norris, and Officers lemini lones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold \nlones, and Does 1-100. \n174.  A common-law private cause of action exists to remedy Maryland constitutional \nviolations through both injunctive relief and money damages. \n175.  Officers lemini lones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold lones, and Does 1-100 \ndirectly violated the constitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs and the class members by \narresting them without probable cause and under an illegal pattern and practice. \n176.  The City, Mayor O'Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, \nDeputy Commissioner Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar constitutional \nviolations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice. \n177.  The City, Mayor O'Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, and \nDeputy Commissioner Brown will continue to cause similar constitutional violations by \nimplementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice in the future. \n178.  The Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices violate Article 26 of the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights. \n179.  Their conduct, patterns, and practice.s were made with malice, ill will, improper \nmotive, and gross negligence. \n180.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices, \nthe individual Plaintiffs and the class members suffered damages. \n181.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat the individual Plaintiffs, the class members, and NAACP members will suffer harm as an \nactual and proximate result of similar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the \nfuture. \n32 \n\nF.

The State, Secretary Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy, \nwith deliberate indifference to the legal rights of Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Stoner, and \nLowery, established, implemented, enforced, or failed to remedy an illegal and unconstitutional \npolicy and practice at CBIC of conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of \npersons temporarily detained at the center, without probable cause or individualized suspicion to \nbelieve the detainees possessed weapons or contraband. \n186.  The conduct, patterns, and practices of strip searching without individualized \nsuspicion every arrestee brought to CBIC is not necessary to protect officer safety, to preserve \nevidence, or to ensure prison security. \n187.  The Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices were made with malice, ill will, \nimproper motive, and gross negligence. \n188.  Such conduct, patterns, and practices violate Article 26 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights. \n189.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices, \nthe individual Plaintiffs suffered damages. \n33 \n\n190.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat the Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer hann as an actual and proximate result of \nsimilar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \nG.

This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, \nStoner, and Lowery against the State, Secretary Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and \nMurphy. \n250.  The State, Saar, Smith, Franks, and Murphy owed a duty to the individual \nPlaintiffs to properly supervise and train their employee corrections officers not to strip search \ndetainees without individualized suspicion. \n251.  However, by purposefully facilitating or failing to abate the known pattern and \npractice of routine strip searches of male detainees, the State, Saar, Smith, Franks, and Murphy \nknew or should have known that their employee corrections officers would conduct such strip \nsearches without individualized suspicion. \n252.

      "text": "Case 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 468   Filed 05/01/13   Page 1 of 7\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \n \nERIC JONES, et al.,       * \n \n    Plaintiffs,      * \n \n  v.          *  Civil No. CCB-05-1287 \n \nSUSAN MURPHY, et al.,      * \n \n    Defendants.      * \n \n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * \n \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS CLAIMS OF PLAINTIFFS ERIC \nJONES AND DAVID COLYNS \n \nDefendants William Jednorski and Susan Murphy, through counsel, respectfully \nmove to dismiss all individual claims filed by Plaintiffs Eric Jones and David Colyns \npursuant to Rules 37(d) and 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Since before \nAugust 5, 2008, Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns have failed to participate in discovery or \notherwise prosecute the claims they have made against the Defendants in this case.  As \nsuch, their remaining individual claims against Defendants Jednorski and Murphy should \nbe dismissed. \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs  initiated  this  lawsuit  on  May  12,  2005,  naming  Eric  Jones  as  an \nindividual  defendant and as  a proposed class representative.  (Paper  No. 1.)   David \nColyns  was  added  as  an  individual  plaintiff  and  proposed  class  representative  by \nPlaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint, filed on April 10, 2006.  (Paper No. 55.)  On \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 468   Filed 05/01/13   Page 2 of 7\nAugust 5, 2008, Defendants sent a notice of depositions to Plaintiffs’ counsel noting \ndepositions for each of the named plaintiffs in the case, including Plaintiffs Jones and \nColyns, and requesting that each plaintiff produce certain documents pertaining to the \nallegations set forth in the complaint.  See Ex. 1, Notice of Depositions Upon Oral \nExamination.  Between August and October 2008, Plaintiffs’ counsel reported that they \nwere unable to make contact with either Jones or Colyns.  In a Joint Status Report filed \non  October  17,  2008,  Plaintiffs’  counsel  explained  that  they  had  been  “unable  to \nproduce” Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns for their depositions and also withdrew their request \nthat those two individuals be designated as class representatives.  (Paper No. 225, at 3; \nsee also Paper No. 243, at 33 n.14).  Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns were never deposed, and \nhave apparently not participated in any way in this case since at least August 2008.   \nOn April 22, 2013, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a motion asking to withdraw their \nappearances for Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns.  (Paper No. 458).  The motion stated that \ncounsel had not had contact with either Mr. Jones or Mr. Colyns since before October 17, \n2008  (Paper  No.  458,  at  1),  and  were  unable  to  act  on  their  claims  without  their \ninvolvement (Id. at 2).  The Court granted the motion on April 26, 2013.  (Paper No. \n467). \nARGUMENT \nBecause Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns were withdrawn as class representatives, their \nonly remaining claims are individual claims.  Those claims should be dismissed under \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 37(d) and 41(b) because both plaintiffs have failed to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 468   Filed 05/01/13   Page 3 of 7\nparticipate in the prosecution of this case and have violated the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure  pertaining  to  discovery  by,  among  other  things,  failing  to  appear  for \ndepositions. \nI.  PLAINTIFFS JONES AND COLYNS EACH FAILED TO APPEAR FOR THEIR \nOWN DEPOSITIONS, WARRANTING THE DISMISSAL OF THEIR CLAIMS \nPURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 37(D). \n \nThe claims filed by Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns should be dismissed pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(d) because each failed to appear for deposition after \nbeing served with proper notice, and otherwise failed to participate in the discovery \nprocess since at least August 2008.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(1)(A)(i) & 37(b)(2)(A)(v).  \nIn  determining  whether  to  impose  sanctions  under  Rule  37(d),  courts  consider \n(1) whether a party acted in bad faith; (2) the amount of prejudice their noncompliance \ncaused;  (3)  whether  there  is  a  need  for  deterrence  of  this  particular  type  of \nnoncompliance; and (4) whether less drastic sanctions would be effective.  See Mut. Fed. \nSav. & Loan Ass’n v. Richards & Assocs., 872 F.2d 88, 92 (4th Cir. 1989).   \n“A  party’s  total  failure  to  comply  with  the  mandates  of  discovery,  with  no \nexplanation for that failure, can certainly justify the harshest of sanctions.”  Warren v. \nUnited States, No. DKC-10-3015, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90658, at *4-5 (D. Md. Aug. \n15, 2011).  Here, without any explanation, Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns failed to appear for \ndepositions.  See id. (finding that the plaintiff acted in bad faith where she failed to attend \nher own deposition or otherwise abide by the rules of discovery).  According to the filing \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 468   Filed 05/01/13   Page 4 of 7\nby their former counsel, Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns failed to respond to their attorneys’ \ninquiries for over four years. \n“‘The  purpose  of  pre-trial  discovery  is  for  a  litigating  attorney  to  obtain \ninformation from the opposing party, information which in many cases is not otherwise \navailable.’”  Id. at *7 (quoting Middlebrooks v. Sebelius, No. PJM-04-2792, 2009 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 71966, 2009 WL 2514111, at *3 (D. Md. Aug. 13, 2009)).  A failure to \ncomply with discovery rules must be deterred, as “[t]here is no doubt” that Plaintiffs \nJones and Colyns’s failure to participate in this case since at least 2008 has “resulted in \nprejudice  to  [the  Defendants]  by  preventing  [them]  from  conducting  discovery, \nevaluating the merits of the claims against [them], and from adequately preparing [their] \ndefense to” the individual claims of Jones and Colyns.  Aerodyne Sys. Eng’g, Ltd. v. \nHeritage Int’l Bank, 115 F.R.D. 281, 288 (D. Md. 1987).  In light of the fact that even \nPlaintiffs’ counsel has been unable to make contact with Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns \nsince at least October 2008, it is clear that a less drastic sanction would not be effective \nhere.    Thus,  dismissal  of  the  individual  claims  of  Plaintiffs  Jones  and  Colyns  is \nappropriate. \nII.  THE CLAIMS BROUGHT BY PLAINTIFFS JONES AND COLYNS SHOULD BE \nDISMISSED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 41(B). \n \nPlaintiffs Jones and Colyns’s claims should also be dismissed pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 41(b) because they have failed to prosecute those claims, or \notherwise to comply with the federal rules pertaining to discovery.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 468   Filed 05/01/13   Page 5 of 7\n41(b).  In evaluating whether to dismiss an action under these circumstances, district \ncourts consider “(1) the degree of personal responsibility of the plaintiff, (2) the amount \nof prejudice caused the defendant, (3) the existence of a drawn out history of deliberately \nproceeding in a dilatory fashion, and (4) the existence of sanctions less drastic than \ndismissal.”  Herbert v. Saffell, 877 F.2d 267, 270 (4th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Here, each of these four factors weighs in favor of dismissal. \nPlaintiffs  Jones  and  Colyns  are  personally  responsible  for  their  failure  to \nparticipate in the prosecution of this case or to abide by the discovery rules.  Under Rule \n41(b), a plaintiff is personally responsible for his unavailability where he has failed to \nprovide adequate contact information.  See O’Neal v. Cook Motorcars, Ltd., No. L-96-\n1816, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10180, *3-4 (D. Md. April 1, 1998) (dismissing claims \nmade by plaintiff who failed to provide an adequate telephone number or residential \naddress, and thus failed to appear for his deposition); see also Van Gorkom v. Deutsche \nBank, No. WDQ-04-2802, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100294, at *5 (D. Md. July 12, 2007) \n(citing plaintiff’s refusal to agree to a deposition date, answer interrogatories, or produce \ndocuments as evidence of the plaintiff’s history of deliberate delay).  Here, Plaintiffs \nJones and Colyns apparently failed to provide their own counsel with updated contact \ninformation,  making  it  impossible  for  the  Defendants  to  obtain  discovery  to  defend \nagainst their claims.  Plaintiffs Jones and Colyns now have a “long history of proceeding \nin a dilatory fashion,” and should not be allowed to move forward in this case.  As such, \nthe sanction of dismissal is warranted. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB   Document 468   Filed 05/01/13   Page 6 of 7\nCONCLUSION \nThe  claims  filed  by  Plaintiffs  Jones  and  Colyns  should  be  dismissed  with \nprejudice. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDOUGLAS F.

The complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \n2.  Plaintiffs failed to file adequate notices of claim within 180 days after injury, barring the \npresent lawsuit. \n3.  Plaintiffs’ claims are barred under principles of governmental immunity. \n4.  Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by absolute and qualified immunity. \n5.  Defendants are immune from all claims in excess of $200,000.00 per occurrence or \n$500,000.00 in the aggregate. \n6.  Plaintiffs do not satisfy the requirements to maintain this action as a class action. \n7.  Some or all plaintiffs lack standing to assert some or all of the claims in the class action \ncomplaint. \n\n8.  Defendants have acted lawfully in all respects.   \n9.  The arrests of the individual plaintiffs were made with probable cause. \n10.  Baltimore’s loitering statute is constitutional on its face and as applied to these plaintiffs. \n11.  Baltimore police officers have the right and responsibility to enforce all criminal laws, \nincluding misdemeanor and quality of life crimes. \n12.  The Baltimore State’s Attorneys Office’s action or inaction with respect to misdemeanor \nand quality of life crimes does not render unlawful an arrest made with probable cause. \n13.

      "text": "Case 1:05-cv-01287-CCB     Document 140      Filed 10/01/2007     Page 1 of 4\n  \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \n \nMARYLAND STATE CONFERENCE OF \nNAACP BRANCHES, et al., \n  Plaintiffs, \n \n  v.  CASE NO. 06-1863 (CCB) \n   \n \nBALTIMORE CITY POLICE \nDEPARTMENT, et al., \n  Defendants. \n \nNAACP PLAINTIFFS’ STATUS REPORT \nIn anticipation of the Status Conference scheduled by this Court for October 4, 2007, the \nMaryland State Conference of NAACP Branches, Baltimore City Branch of the NAACP, Evan \nHoward, Tyrone Braxton, Donald Wilson, Robert Lowery, and Aaron Stoner (together, the \nNAACP Plaintiffs), through their counsel, submit this status report on the progress of the above-\ncaptioned case. \n1.  Discovery is progressing between the Plaintiffs and Defendants, to varying degrees. \n(a) The NAACP Plaintiffs and the Jones Plaintiffs have been proceeding with electronic, \nhardcopy, and deposition discovery from the State Defendants.  Regarding electronic data, we \nhave received information pertaining to arrests from 2002—August 2007.  We are now working \nwith the State Defendants to “clean” the data of errors that would prevent effective statistical \nreview.  Regarding the hardcopy documents, we have received the majority of the documents \nordered to be produced on August 2, 2007.  We are working with the State to fill-in unintended \n \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB     Document 140      Filed 10/01/2007     Page 2 of 4\ngaps in the information provided.  Regarding deposition discovery, the NAACP Plaintiffs, in \nconjunction with the Jones’ Plaintiffs, have deposed two former Arrest Booking Officers and two \ncurrent Correctional Officers (“line staff” depositions).  Based on information learned in these \ndepositions, the parties have determined that additional depositions are necessary.  Three dates \nhave been scheduled for additional line staff depositions.  In addition., a 30(b)(6) deposition \nrelating to State policy and procedures for arrestee searches is scheduled for October 25, 2007.  \nWe do not anticipate any need for the Court’s intervention at this time. \n(b) The NAACP Plaintiffs have deposed James Green, Director of Special Projects and \nFrederick Bealefeld, Acting Police Commissioner pursuant to the Court’s Amended December \n20, 2006, Order.  The NAACP Plaintiffs received three CDs of documents from the Police \nDepartment last week, and are continuing a review of those documents.  Once that review is \ncompleted, the NAACP Plaintiffs will evaluate whether any additional requests for documents \nare warranted.  Also, as discussed more fully below, the NAACP Plaintiffs intend to request \ndepositions of certain individuals in the near future. \n(c) The Mayor’s Office has produced three documents.  The City Council has produced a \nsmall number of documents from Councilman Kraft.  It is our understanding that the City \nCouncil transitioned email systems around December 2005, and no email from the period prior \nto the transition was archived.  Additionally, the Mayor’s Office deleted data from the O’Malley \nadministration in January 2007.  The loss of data by the City Council and Mayor’s Office \noccurred despite having received document requests from the NAACP Plaintiffs on July 19, \n2006, while this case was pending in Circuit Court for the City of Baltimore.  While the NAACP \nPlaintiffs continue to confer with counsel to the City Council and Mayor’s Office to understand \nthe scope of the lost data, it is likely we will seek remedies from the Court.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB     Document 140      Filed 10/01/2007     Page 3 of 4\n2.   The NAACP Plaintiffs, in light of information obtained during discovery, intend to file a \nmotion to amend the complaint to add individual plaintiffs that have been identified since the \nfiling of the original complaint.  We will confer with the Defendants to seek their consent before \nfiling a Motion with the Court for leave to amend. \n3.  The NAACP Plaintiffs also intend to move the Court to amend the December 20 order to \nallow depositions of individual police officers and certain of their superiors.  The Police \nDepartment has produced some documents responsive to the December 20 Order.  While we are \ncontinuing to evaluate the adequacy of this discovery, productions to date indicate that most of \nthe documents have come from hardcopy files of high-ranking Police Department officials.  \nThere is no indication that any search of electronic files, such as email, has been conducted.  We \nbelieve that a reasonable search of documents responsive to the December 20 order would \ninclude a search of electronic sources of information, including email from both high-ranking \nPolice Department officials and line officers.  While reserving our right to petition the court to \ncompel production of such material, the NAACP Plaintiffs are willing to work with the Police \nDepartment to obtain relevant information through depositions.  The Rule 30(b)(6) depositions \nof Messrs. Green and Bealefeld revealed that many policies, procedures and especially practices \nof the Police Department are communicated to police officers orally.  Accordingly, depositions \nof the particular police officers associated with the arrests of the NAACP Plaintiffs, and certain \nof these officers’ superiors, is likely to elicit information about policies, procedures and practices \nthat are the subject of this litigation.  A motion seeking to amend the Court’s December 20, 2006  \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01287-CCB     Document 140      Filed 10/01/2007     Page 4 of 4\nOrder to allow for these depositions will be forthcoming.  \nRespectfully Submitted, \nDated:  October 1, 2007                      /s/ \nDeborah A.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under a pattern and practice set and enforced by city officials, Baltimore police \nofficers arrest individuals without probable cause, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights. \n2.  To encourage this pattern and practice, the Baltimore City Police Department \n(\"Police Department\") rewards police officers with more arrests and punishes officers with \nfewer arrests, regardless of the number or success of resulting prosecutions. \n2  \n\n3.  As a consequence, Baltimore prosecutors decided to drop the charges against \napproximately 30 percent of those arrested without a warrant in 2005 prior to any involvement \nby a defense attorney, and prior to review of the charges by a court commissioner. \n4.  The Maryland Central Booking and Intake Center (\"CBIC\") receives these \narrestees for processing, and compounds the problem by conducting strip searches of male \narrestees without probable cause or individualized suspicion that they are carrying weapons \nor contraband, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \n5.  The volume of arrests by the Police Department has caused CBIC to detain many \narrestees beyond the statutory time limit of 24 hours before presentment or release, in \nviolation of Maryland Rule 4-212(f) and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.  In some cases, \nthe detentions have exceeded 48 hours, in violation of the U.S. Constitution. \n6.  These unconstitutional and illegal acts degrade, humiliate, and cause grave harm \nto their victims.  Individuals who are arrested suffer unwarranted deprivation of personal \nliberty, sometimes for days.  They may lose their jobs or be denied job opportunities in the \nfuture as a result of the permanent stigma of having a criminal charge on their record.  They \nsuffer the humiliation of being hauled away in handcuffs in front of friends, family, or \nneighbors.  At CBIC, they are subjected to the degradation of strip searches—in many \ncases, visual body cavity searches—in front of other detainees.  They are detained, \nsometimes for days at a time, in filthy, overcrowded conditions.  Then, when the State's \nAttorney declines to prosecute, they are Released Without Charge (RWOC'd), though they \nhave technically already been charged by the police—often because the police had no right \nto arrest them in the first place. \n3  \n\n7.  Despite the patently unconstitutional and illegal nature of this conduct and its \ndetrimental effects on the Baltimore residents whom the laws are supposed to protect, city \nofficials have refused to reform their practices.  The time has come to rein in this abuse of \npower and stop these unconstitutional and illegal acts. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331. \n9.  Venue is proper as the events complained of occurred in the Northern Division of \nthe District of Maryland, and the defendants carry out business therein. \n10. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants State of Maryland (\"State\"), \nthe Mayor and City Council of the City of Baltimore (\"City\"), and the Police Department \nbecause they are entities consisting of or located within Maryland. \n11. This Court also has personal jurisdiction over individual Defendants Maynard, \nSaar, Smith, Franks, Murphy, O'Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Brown, Bealefeld, Clark, Norris, Jemini \nJones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Southard, Pinkosz, \nHamilton, Mealey, Officer Does A-R, and Officer Does 1-100.  Upon information and belief, \nMaynard, Saar, Smith, Franks, Murphy, Dixon, O'Malley, Hamm, Brown, Bealefeld, Jemini \nJones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Southard, Pinkosz, \nHamilton, Mealey, Officer Does A-R, and Officer Does 1-100 maintain domiciles within the \nState of Maryland.  In addition, this Court has personal jurisdiction over all of the individual \nDefendants under Maryland's long-arm statute because (a) their tortious actions and \nomissions occurred and caused injury within Maryland and (b) they are (or were at the time \n4  \n\nof the illegal acts) all employed within Maryland, thus performing a character of work or \nservice within Maryland.  \nIII.  PRE-SUIT REQUIREMENTS \n12. Plaintiffs Howard, Lowery, Braxton, Stoner, Wilson, Johnson, Crockett, Horsey, \nLindsay, Marcus, and Chapman have satisfied the necessary pre-suit prerequisites under \nthe Maryland Tort Claims Act and the Local Government Tort Claims Act for each of the \npertinent claims listed below in Section VIII; Plaintiff Higgs has satisfied the necessary \nprerequisites under the Local Government Tort Claims Act; and Plaintiffs Scott and Wright \nhave satisfied the necessary prerequisites under the Maryland Tort Claims Act. \n13. Evan Howard submitted notice of his claims to the Baltimore City Solicitor and the \nMaryland State Treasurer via certified mail, return receipt requested, on September 23, 2005.  \nOn September 29, 2005, the City notified Mr. Howard's counsel that the claim against the City \nhad been referred to Michael Fry of the Baltimore City Police Department for attention and \ndisposition.  On October 4, 2005, the Maryland State Treasurer acknowledged receipt of Mr. \nHoward's claim.  The Maryland State Treasurer failed to give Mr. Howard notice of a final \ndecision within six months after the filing of his claim. \n14.

ALLEGATIONS OF FACT \nA.  The Experiences of the Individual Plaintiffs \n1.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton \n73. At approximately 8:30 p.m. on Friday, April 15, 2005, Plaintiff Evan Howard was \nstanding on the sidewalk that runs past his home on Poplar Grove Street in Baltimore, about \na block away from his front door, engaging in conversation with Plaintiff Tyrone Braxton and \nanother friend, Correy Alexander. \n74. After a few minutes, Defendant Officers Jemini Jones and Doe 1 pulled up behind \nBraxton's car in an unmarked police cruiser.  The plainclothes officers approached the three \nfriends and asked if they had any information about a recent homicide. \n75. The officers then asked Howard, Braxton, and Alexander their ages.  After revealing \nthat he was a minor, Alexander was ordered to go home, which he did. \n76. Then, without explanation, probable cause, or any legal justification, the officers \nconducted pat-down searches of Howard and Braxton and placed them under arrest.  The \narrests were purportedly for loitering and impeding the flow of pedestrian traffic, even though \nneither Howard nor Braxton had been loitering and the officers had not ordered them to \ndisperse. \n77. Officer Jemini Jones tightly bound the young men's hands with plastic handcuffs \nand placed Howard and Braxton in a vehicle for transport to CBIC. \n78. Howard and Braxton arrived at CBIC at about 10:00 p.m., where they waited for \napproximately an hour to begin the booking process.  Upon entering CBIC, they were \nscreened with a metal detector, which showed that neither carried any weapons. \n2 1 \n\n79. At approximately 11:00 p.m., Howard and Braxton were subjected to humiliating \npublic strip searches by Defendant Officers Doe A and Doe B.  Howard, Braxton, and two \nother detainees were placed in a holding cell, ordered to remove all of their clothing down to \ntheir underpants, face the wall, pull their underpants down to expose their buttocks, and \nsubmit to a visual body cavity search. \n80. The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat either Howard or Braxton was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n81. Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Howard or Braxton \nduring the search. \n82. After the strip search, Howard and Braxton were taken to a small, filthy, and \novercrowded cell, where they stayed with about ten other detainees through the night.  The \ncell had no bathroom and was so overcrowded that both Howard and Braxton were forced to \nsit in uncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time. \n83. At approximately 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, April 16, Howard and Braxton were taken \nto a slightly larger cell containing about 15 other detainees.  This cell was also filthy and \nunsanitary.  Throughout the day, the number of people in the cell fluctuated, frequently \nswelling to nearly 20.  Once again, both Howard and Braxton were forced to sit in \nuncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time. \n84. During their confinement, Howard and Braxton were provided \"meals\" in their cells \nthree times each day.  The meals principally consisted of two slices of bread covering shiny \nand slimy meat, which Howard and Braxton believed to be spoiled bologna. \n2 2 \n\n85. Braxton was finally released on Sunday, April 17, at 10:00 a.m., after being held at \nCBIC for 36 hours. \n86. Howard was finally released on Monday, April 18, at 4:00 a.m., after being held at \nCBIC for 54 hours.  Howard, far from home and unable to contact anyone to pick him up from \nCBIC, was forced to walk back to his home in the dark at a dangerous hour of night through \nunfamiliar streets. \n87. Neither Howard nor Braxton was ever prosecuted for any crime or ever brought \nbefore a court commissioner.  \n2.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiff Wilson \n88. On April 10, 2006, Plaintiff Donald Wilson was sitting on the front steps of a \nresidence in which his girlfriend and toddler son live.  He was visiting them and waiting for \nhis younger brother, Darrell. \n89. While Mr. Wilson was sitting on the steps with two friends, an unmarked police \nSubaru raced down the street in pursuit of a dirt bike.  A crowd of approximately 15 neighbors \ngathered along the block to watch the chase. \n90. Failing to catch the bicyclist, the maroon police Subaru pulled up to the residence \nand Officer Crites and Sergeant Pecha exited the vehicle.  Officer Crites yelled, \"Everybody sit \nthe f**k down!\"  Everyone in the area obeyed.  Wilson, at the time, was already sitting down. \n91. The officers began questioning the group of people, asking them where they lived \nand what they were doing there.  Most were patted down and asked to show identification.  \nWilson provided his identification when requested. \n2 3 \n\n92. Crites questioned Wilson and asked whether Wilson lived there.  When Wilson \nfirmly responded in the affirmative, Crites took offense and, in a low tone of voice, threatened \nto \"f**k [him] up.\" \n93. When Wilson responded to this threat, by observing that Crites had whispered his \nthreat rather than stating it aloud in front of witnesses, Crites immediately ordered Wilson to \nstand up.  Wilson asked why, and Crites responded, \"Don't f**king say nothing to me,\" and \nordered Wilson to stand up and put his hands behind his back. \n94. Wilson complied and asked why he was being arrested.  Crites responded, \"Don't \nworry about it.  You're going to jail.\" \n95. Wilson asked Crites for his name and badge number.  Crites replied, \"911.\" \n96. Crites placed metal handcuffs on Wilson and ordered him to sit on the ground.  At \nthat time, two marked police cruisers arrived at the scene, and two additional officers exited \nthose vehicles. \n97. Wilson asked his girlfriend to call his mother, and then he remained calm and \nquiet. \n98. The police began to tell people to leave.  After about 15 minutes, Wilson's mother \narrived.  She politely asked who the officer in charge was.  Sgt. Pecha responded that he \nwas in charge.  Wilson's mother asked what her son was being detained for.  Pecha asked \nfor Wilson's age, and when his mother said, \"21,\" Pecha stated that he did not have to give \nher any information because Wilson was not a minor.  Upon further questioning, Pecha \ncontinued to refuse to explain why Wilson was arrested. \n2 4 \n\n99. Wilson's mother therefore went to talk with her son, who explained what had \nhappened.  After about two minutes, Pecha came over and told her that she had to leave or \nshe would be arrested.  When she asked for Pecha's name and badge number, Pecha \nignored her. \n100.  Crites and Pecha did not have nametags on and their badges were tucked \ninside their shirts to hide identifying information. \n101.  Crites put Wilson in the police car and transported him to CBIC at \napproximately 9:15 p.m. \n102.  At CBIC, Wilson was taken to a waiting room, where he was ordered to strip \ndown to his boxers and searched by Officer Does C-D.  A Latino man next to him in the same \nroom was completely naked. \n103.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat Wilson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  Indeed, no contraband was found \nin his possession. \n104.  Wilson was finally released from CBIC at around 2:00 a.m. the next day.  He \nwas not allowed to use a phone at CBIC, so he walked to the nearest pay phone to call his \nmother. \n105.  Wilson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n106.  On April 5, 2007 in the late afternoon, Donald Wilson visited a friend on \nAbbottston Road.  After some time at the friend's house, Wilson and his friend left to return to \n2 5 \n\nWilson's house.  The friend's mother called her son back in just as the two men were \nleaving the house.  Wilson stood outside waiting for his friend to rejoin him. \n107.  As Wilson was waiting for this friend and was tying his shoe with his foot on the \nstoop of the neighboring property, two uniformed officers and a plain-clothes officer \napproached him.  The officers demanded to know why he was standing where he was.  \nWilson explained that he was waiting for his friend. \n108.  Unsatisfied, the officers interrogated Wilson as to whether he had drugs on \nhim, where his friends were, and other subjects.  The officers searched Wilson, patting him \ndown and searching his pockets.  No weapons, drugs or contraband were found by this \nsearch.  Wilson told the officers that he was not carrying drugs, and indicated that he was \noffended that they seemed to assume that he was a drug dealer.  A uniformed officer took \nWilson's identification.  \n109.  Several minutes after the police arrived, Wilson's friend came out of his house \nand asked the officers what was going on.  The officers told him to go back into his house, \nwhich he did.  Wilson's friend watched the arrest from his window. \n110.  After Wilson was searched, the plain-clothes officer handcuffed Wilson, telling \nhim that he was being arrested for \"getting smart.\" \n111.  In fact, Wilson was charged with trespass on posted property, but at all times \nrelevant hereto, the property was not posted with any no-trespassing signs. \n112.  Wilson asked the arresting officer for his name, but the officer ignored the \nrequest. \n2 6 \n\n113.  Wilson was transported to the Eastern District police station in a paddy wagon, \nwhere he was interrogated by a police detective concerning gangs and shootings.  Wilson \nhad no information related to the detective's questions and told him so. \n114.  Wilson was then taken to Central Booking, arriving at approximately 6:00 p.m.   \n115.  He asked the intake officer for the arresting officer's name but the request was \nrefused. \n116.  Wilson was then subjected to a humiliating strip search by Officer Doe L.  In \nfront of another prisoner, who had been forced to undress completely, Wilson was forced to \npull his pants down to his ankles and to allow the officer to look inside his underwear \nwaistband.  He was also made to lift his shirt for the officer.   \n117.  Officer Doe L told Wilson that his arrest was part of the BPD's \"low tolerance\" \npolicy.   \n118.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that Wilson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  No contraband was \nfound in this search. \n119.  Wilson was then confined at CIBC.  He shuttled between four different cells, \nwhich were so crowded that Wilson was often forced to sit or lie on the concrete floor.   \n120.  Wilson was released at approximately 3:30 a.m. on April 6, 2007, after being \ndetained for approximately nine and one half hours.  \n121.  Wilson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n2 7 \n\n3.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Stoner and Lowery \n122.  On May 7, 2005, Plaintiff Aaron Stoner, Plaintiff Robert Lowery, Walter Medina, \nJr., and four other friends and co-workers visited the city of Baltimore to celebrate Stoner's \nupcoming wedding.  After visiting the Inner Harbor, the group of friends left on foot in the early \nmorning hours of May 8 to return to their hotel. \n123.  While walking back to their hotel, a marked police car containing Defendant \nOfficers Newkirk and Arnold Jones drove past.  Newkirk instructed the group to \"keep \nmoving,\" even though the group had not actually paused during the journey.  They obeyed \nand continued to walk back to their hotel. \n124.  About two minutes later, the same patrol car drove past the group.  Medina was \nthe first to see the approaching car, and remarked to Stoner, \"Here comes that cop again.\" \n125.  Officer Newkirk pulled the car to the side, stopped the car, and exited.  Newkirk \nconfronted Medina, the only African-American in the group, demanding, \"What did you say, \nboy?\"  Before Medina could answer, Newkirk pushed him against a wall. \n126.  After Newkirk pushed Medina against the wall and began to aggressively \nquestion him, Stoner verbally protested.  Newkirk then turned toward Stoner and ran at him \nwith his baton fortifying his raised forearm.  Defendant Newkirk hit Stoner with such force as \nto knock Stoner off of his feet. \n127.  Newkirk then instructed Stoner and the other five men to \"keep walking.\"  Stoner \nobeyed by getting up and walking to the rest of the group. \n128.  Newkirk then issued a warning citation for loitering to Medina. \n2 8 \n\n129.  Lowery, upset at the police harassment and brutality he had witnessed, then \nleft the group, approached Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones, and asked for Newkirk's \nname and badge number. \n130.  Newkirk refused to answer Lowery's question, but Defendant Arnold Jones \nresponded by placing Lowery under arrest, purportedly for \"failure to obey\" an order to cease \nloitering.  This arrest was made without probable cause or legal justification. \n131.  Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones then drove Lowery down the block to where \nStoner, having obeyed Newkirk's earlier order to \"keep walking,\" was walking with his party.  \nThe officers then arrested Stoner as well. \n132.  Stoner's arrest was also purportedly for \"failure to obey\" an order to cease \nloitering.  This arrest was made without probable cause or legal justification. \n133.  Stoner and Lowery were both subjected to pat-down searches, which revealed \nthey were carrying no contraband or weapons. \n134.  Medina, who had been issued a warning citation for loitering, and the other four \nmembers of the original group were permitted to continue walking back to the hotel. \n135.  Stoner and Lowery were transported to CBIC, where they were processed and \nsubjected to another pat-down search that revealed them to be free of contraband and \nweapons. \n136.  Despite the negative results of the searches, Defendant Corrections Officers \nDoe E and Doe F subjected Stoner and Lowery to humiliating public strip searches at CBIC. \n137.  Stoner and Lowery, along with two other detainees, were ordered to strip to \ntheir underpants while the officers conducted the search. \n2 9 \n\n138.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that either Stoner or Lowery was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n139.  Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Stoner or Lowery \nduring the search. \n140.  Both Stoner and Lowery were held in small, filthy, and overcrowded cells that \nwere packed with other detainees.  Both Stoner and Lowery were forced to sit or crouch in \nuncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time because of the overcrowded \nconditions. \n141.  Stoner and Lowery were released from CBIC at approximately 8:00 p.m. on May \n8, after being detained for 17 hours. \n142.  Neither Stoner nor Lowery was ever prosecuted for any crime or brought before \na court commissioner.  \n4.  The Illegal Arrest and Search of Timothy Johnson \n143.  In the early morning hours of June 25, 2006, Timothy Johnson and three \nacquaintances were walking down the street towards their hotel, the Baltimore Waterfront \nMarriott.   \n144.  Johnson and his three colleagues were in Baltimore to attend the Annual \nScientific Meeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism. \n145.  While walking down the street, Johnson and his acquaintances encountered a \nwoman whom they did not know, who was walking in the same direction.  Because they \nwere traveling in the same direction, the five pedestrians would have appeared to be a \nsingle group. \n3 0 \n\n146.  Concerned that the woman should not be walking alone late at night in the \narea, and assuming that she was a fellow attendee at the conference, one of Johnson's \ncolleagues told the woman that they were walking back to the hotel and asked if she wanted \nto walk with them. \n147.  A marked police cruiser then drove up and stopped near the group, and one \nofficer asked if everything was okay.  Some members of the group responded, \"Yes.\" \n148.  The officer then asked, referring to the woman who had just joined the group, \n\"Is she with you?\"  One of Johnson's acquaintances informed the officer that the woman had \njust joined them. \n149.  The officer then began questioning the woman, who responded to his \nquestions while continuing to walk.  The officer exited his vehicle, ordered the woman to \nstop, and then directed Johnson and his friends to keep walking. \n150.  The group continued walking, although they were concerned for the well-being \nof the woman, who kept saying that she just wanted to go back to the hotel. \n151.  At the end of the block, Johnson turned around to see the officer handcuffing \nthe woman. \n152.  While Johnson was waiting to cross the street, the officer yelled for Johnson to \ncome back, and Johnson complied. \n153.  Johnson had not said a word to the officer, nor had he said anything loudly \nabout the officer or about the situation.  He assumed that he would be questioned about the \nwoman or would be a witness to the arrest. \n3 1 \n\n154.  At that time, another uniformed officer and two plainclothes officers arrived on \nthe scene.  They ordered Johnson to stop, subjected him to a pat-down search, and asked \nhim to sit down on the curb.   \n155.  No contraband was found during the pat-down search. \n156.  The first officer then told the other officers that \"these people were hindering\" \nand that they hadn't moved fast enough.  The officers also joked that they were going to \ndeliver the woman \"back to her boyfriend in chains.\" \n157.  Johnson was then placed under arrest, subjected to a second pat-down \nsearch, and placed in a vehicle bound for Central Booking.  Once again, no contraband was \nfound. \n158.  Johnson was then transported to CBIC, where he was booked and \nfingerprinted. \n159.  Despite the negative results of the previous pat-down searches, Mr. Johnson \nwas subjected to a humiliating strip search by Officer Does G and H, during which he was \nrequired to remove all of his clothing except a T-shirt. \n160.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat Johnson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n161.  Indeed, no contraband was found in Johnson's possession during the search. \n162.  After the illegal strip search, Johnson was held with two other men in a small, \nfilthy cell designed for only one detainee.  He was released at 8:30 a.m., after being in \ncustody for approximately six hours. \n3 2 \n\n163.  Johnson's release came a mere thirty minutes before he was scheduled to \ngive a presentation at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism, \nthe reason for his trip to Baltimore. \n164.  Johnson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n5.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Tavis Crockett \n165.  At approximately 5:45 p.m. on July 23, 2006, Tavis Crockett and approximately \nsix other young men from his neighborhood were sitting on the front steps of a friend's \nbuilding, getting ready to watch a neighborhood game of basketball.  \n166.  As the group began to get up and move toward the basketball courts, a number \nof police cruisers pulled up and Officer Grey exited his cruiser. \n167.  Officer Grey asked the group where Brandon was.  Upon information and belief, \nBrandon is a young man in the neighborhood that the police believe to be a drug dealer. \n168.  Brandon was not present, although the young men had seen him walk by \nearlier in the day. \n169.  Upon learning that Brandon was not present, Officer Grey told all seven young \nmen that they were being arrested for loitering.   \n170.  Officer Grey and approximately ten other police officers then took all seven \nyoung men into custody.  All seven boys were subjected to pat-down searches, which \nrevealed no weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n171.  The arrests were not preceded by a warning that the young men were loitering, \nor by a directive to move along. \n3 3 \n\n172.  When the young men arrived at the police station, three of them were let go \nbecause they were juveniles.  Crockett and the other three non-minors were transported to \nCBIC. \n173.  At CBIC, Defendant Corrections Officers Doe I and Doe J subjected Crockett to \na humiliating public strip search. \n174.  Crockett, along with another detainee, was ordered to strip to his underpants \nwhile the officers conducted the search. \n175.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat Crockett was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n176.  Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of Crockett during the \nsearch. \n177.  Crockett was held in small, filthy, and overcrowded cells that were packed with \nother detainees. \n178.  Crockett was released from CBIC at approximately 8:00 a.m. on July 24, after \nbeing detained for 14 hours. \n179.  Crockett was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n180.  On August 22, 2006, at about 8:50 p.m., Crockett was walking from his Aunt's \nhouse to a nearby convenience store near Carey Street and Riggs Avenue in Baltimore, a \ndistance of approximately one block. \n181.  As Crockett walked to the convenience store he was stopped by four plain-\nclothes police officers.   \n3 4 \n\n182.  One of the officers told Crockett, \"Come on, you're going downtown with us.\"  \nCrockett asked the officer why he was being arrested.  The officer told Crockett that he had \nlittered.   \n183.  Crockett told the officer that he was not aware that he had dropped anything, \nand offered to pick up a food wrapper the officer claimed Crockett had dropped.  The officer \ndid not let Crockett pick up the wrapper.   \n184.  Crockett was searched on the sidewalk, and then taken to the Western District \nstation, where he was held in a cell with two other detainees.  He remained in this cell for \nfour hours.  The police denied Crockett's request to call his mother.   \n185.  At approximately midnight, Crockett was transported to CBIC, handcuffed, in a \npaddy wagon.   \n186.  Inside CBIC, Crockett was subjected to a humiliating strip search.  A female \nofficer, Doe M, made Crockett strip to his boxers in front of two other officers and another \ndetainee. \n187.  This strip search was conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that Crockett was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.   \n188.  No contraband was found in the possession of Crockett during the search. \n189.  Crockett was then confined to a cell with ten other detainees where he \nremained for four hours.  After being fingerprinted and photographed, he was confined again \nin another cell. \n3 5 \n\n190.  At approximately 8:15 a.m. on August 23, 2006, Crockett was finally released, \nafter being held for approximately eleven and one half hours.  He did not arrive home until \n9:00 a.m., after a 45-minute public bus trip from CBIC.   \n191.  Crockett was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n6.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Raffic Scott and Kerrell Wright \n192.  At approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 30, 2006 Raffic Scott, Kerrell Wright and \napproximately five fellow members of their church, the Israelite Church of God and Jesus \nChrist, were handing out religious literature on a sidewalk on Belair Road and Erdman \nAvenue in Baltimore.  The church members periodically engage in sidewalk proselytizing to \nspread their religious message.  When doing so, they generally wear distinctive robes that \nsignify their church membership. \n193.  Officers Chin and Southard approached the group in a squad car and \ndemanded to know what they were doing.  Scott responded that he and his group were \nhanding out religious literature.   \n194.  When the police approached, Wright began videotaping the encounter, as is \nthe Church’s practice due to frequent police harassment. \n195.  After demanding that Wright cease video recording, and claiming that it was \nillegal to videotape police officers without permission from the officer or from police \nheadquarters, Officer Chin demanded that Wright produce identification.  In order to do so, \nWright passed the video camera to Scott. \n3 6 \n\n196.  An officer then told Mr. Scott that he had to cease filming.  When Scott refused, \nOfficer Chin told Scott to put his hands on this head and pushed Scott against a wall. \n197.  Officer Chin forcibly removed Scott's religious clothing, throwing his headpiece, \nrobe and belt to the ground.   \n198.  Scott was searched on the scene.  This search revealed no drugs, weapons, or \ncontraband.   \n199.  Wright was also arrested.  He was thrown to the ground and had his religious \nclothing removed and also thrown to the ground. \n200.  Wright was searched on the scene.  This search revealed no drugs, weapons, \nor contraband.   \n201.  As Scott and Wright were being arrested, approximately eight officers arrived on \nthe scene in several squad cars, blocking the adjacent intersection. \n202.  During or before their arrests, neither Scott, Wright, nor any other member of \ntheir group was told by the police that any of them was loitering or was instructed to move on. \n203.  Scott was transported to the Northern District precinct.  During his confinement \nthere Scott was verbally abused by police officers on the subject of his religious beliefs.   \n204.  Scott was then transported to the CBIC, where he was subjected to a \nhumiliating and gratuitously invasive strip search by Defendant Corrections Officers Doe K \nand Doe N.  In the presence of another detainee, who was also being strip searched at the \nsame time, Scott was forced to strip to his underwear.  He was made to squat in front of \nOfficers Doe K and Doe N, while they looked inside of Scott's underwear. \n3 7 \n\n205.  After his arrest, Wright was also taken to CBIC.  At CBIC, Wright was also \nsubjected to a humiliating strip search.  In the presence of two jail administrators, Officer \nDoe O forced Wright to remove his shirt and jeans. \n206.  The strip searches of Scott and of Wright were conducted without probable \ncause or individualized suspicion that either Scott or Wright was carrying weapons, drugs, or \ncontraband.  These searches revealed no drugs, weapons or contraband. \n207.  Scott was released at approximately 6:00 a.m. on August 31, 2006 after being \nheld for eight hours.  Wright was held for approximately 20 hours, until he was released on \nhis own recognizance at approximately 6:00 p.m. the next day.   \n208.  Both Scott and Wright were charged with disorderly conduct and loitering.  On \nSeptember 29, 2006 the State’s Attorney nolle prossed all charges against Scott.  On \nOctober 20, 2006, the State’s Attorney nolle prossed all charges against Wright.  \n7  The Illegal Arrest of Carol Higgs \n209.  At approximately 9:00 a.m. on March 2, 2004, primary election day in Maryland, \nCarol Higgs was posting election signs and handing out campaign leaflets.  \n210.  Higgs posted her signs and stood near Chase House, a designated polling \nplace for the primary.   \n211.  She stood outside the area near Chase House, marked by signs posted by \nelection officials, where no electioneering was permitted that day.  An election judge had \nconfirmed to Higgs that she was in compliance with election regulations regarding proximity \nto a polling place. \n3 8 \n\n212.  Officer Pinkosz arrived at Chase House in a squad car.  He approached Ms. \nHiggs and asked her why she was picketing.  She said that she was not picketing but rather \nhanding out campaign literature for her candidate. \n213.  Officer Pinkosz left Higgs and went inside the polling place.  He reemerged and \ntold Ms. Higgs that her campaigning was illegal.   \n214.  When Higgs pointed out that she stood outside the \"no electioneering\" signs \nand was thus in compliance with the law, Officer Pinkosz removed the sign from where it \nwas planted, and without taking any measurements, moved it significantly farther than 100 \nfeet away from the polling place.   \n215.  Higgs then moved, to remain outside the boundary of another sign setting \ncampaigning boundaries.  She also asked Officer Pinkosz for his name and badge number.   \n216.  At this point, Officer Pinkosz demanded her identification.   \n217.  Higgs asked Officer Pinkosz whether she was free to go.  Officer Pinkosz said \nthat she was free to go.  As Higgs gathered her literature, Officer Pinkosz handcuffed her.  He \ntold her that she was being arrested for loitering. \n218.  Higgs was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n  8.  The Illegal Arrest and Search of Armondo Horsey, and the Illegal Arrest of   \n    Jonathan Lindsay \n \n219.  On July 22, 2007, after a late night out, Armondo Horsey, Jonathan Lindsay, and \nHorsey's brother had ordered a pizza at a pizza shop in the Canton section of Baltimore. \n3 9 \n\n220.  While eating, Horsey, Lindsay, and Horsey's brother noticed Baltimore Police \nDepartment officers detaining a man on a nearby corner.  They observed five officers \nforcefully restraining a man in handcuffs who was lying on the ground. \n221.  Lindsay moved closer to the scene and pulled out his cell phone as if to film \nthe arrest, because he believed the officers were using excessive force.  Two officers at the \nscene observed him with his phone, and told him that he was not allowed to take \nphotographs. \n222.  When Horsey observed Lindsay speaking with the officers, he was concerned \nthat Lindsay was protesting the officers’ use of force, and told him not to get into an \nargument, but just to get the officers’ names and badge numbers.   \n223.  A Baltimore Police Department officer who overheard Horsey’s comment \nsingled him out from among the crowd of onlookers and told him that he was going to jail \nwith the man being restrained.  \n224.  Horsey was then forcefully handcuffed behind his back and pulled backward \ntoward a police van.   \n225.  Horsey was searched at the scene of his arrest.  The search revealed no \ndrugs, contraband or weapons. \n226.  When Lindsay, standing nearby, then called out that Horsey “didn’t even do \nanything,” a Baltimore Police Department officer singled Lindsay out from among the crowd \nof onlookers and placed him in handcuffs.  While in handcuffs an officer searched Lindsay’s \npockets, pulled out his cell phone, and opened it up and scrolled through it to see whether \nthere were any photographs or film of the scene captured on it. \n4 0 \n\n227.  Horsey, Lindsay, and the man who was being restrained on the ground were \nthen placed in a police van and transported to CBIC.  A police officer told Lindsay that he \nshouldn’t worry about being arrested because he would be released in a few hours.  \n228.  At CBIC, Horsey and Lindsay were shuffled among numerous overcrowded jail \ncells with open toilets reeking of excrement. \n229.  At CBIC Officer Doe P strip searched Horsey.  Horsey was made to remove his \npants, and Officer Doe P had Horsey open his waistband and looked into Horsey's \nunderwear.  The strip search was conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that Horsey was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  The strip search \nrevealed no drugs, weapons or contraband. \n230.  Horsey and Lindsay were both held at CBIC for about six hours. \n231.  Neither Horsey nor Lindsay was ever prosecuted for any crime or brought \nbefore a court commissioner.  Horsey and Lindsay later learned that Officer Mealey had \ncharged them with failure to obey. \n4 1 \n\n9.  The Illegal Arrest of Erin Marcus \n232.  On October 12, 2007, Erin Marcus, along with seven other members of the \nBaltimore Animal Rights Coalition (BARC), arrived at Salt Restaurant in Baltimore City to \nstage a peaceful protest regarding the restaurant’s use of foie gras.   \n233.  The members arrived outside of the restaurant at approximately 7:30 p.m.  They \nstood clear of the entrance, and did not obstruct the walkway in front of the restaurant.   \n234.  Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes after their arrival two Baltimore Police \nDepartment officers arrived at the scene.  The officers told the BARC members that if they did \nnot cross the street they would be subject to arrest. \n235.  A BARC member then spoke with police officers and explained that he had \ncontacted the Office of Licensing and Permits and was told that the group did not need a \npermit to protest.  Another BARC member attempted to review the Baltimore City loitering \nordinance with the officers, including a shift commander who arrived on the scene, in order \nto establish their legal right to be there. The officers were not persuaded and again told all \nBARC members to cross the street or face arrest. \n236.  All but three BARC members crossed the street and continued protesting on \nthe other side of the street.  Marcus and the other protesters who did not cross the street \nwere arrested. \n237.  Marcus was asked for identification by two female officers.  She showed the \nofficers her driver's license.  One of the female officers frisked Marcus and checked her bag.  \nNo weapons, contraband or drugs were found in this search.   \n4 2 \n\n238.  Marcus was then put in plastic cuffs and placed in the police van with the two \nother BARC members who were arrested.  Marcus was transported to CBIC, arriving about \n45 minutes after her initial encounter with the police.  \n239.  Marcus was then taken to a filthy, crowded cell where some inmates were \nforced to sit on the floor.   \n240.  Marcus was charged with failure to obey, and released on her own \nrecognizance at about 8:00 a.m. on October 13, 2007 after being held at CBIC for about 13 \nhours. \n241.  The State’s Attorney nolle prossed all charges against Marcus on October 16, \n2007. \n10.  The Illegal Search of Jeffrey Chapman \n242.  On or about October 13, 2005, at approximately 6:00 p.m., Jeffrey Chapman \nwas walking on Marion Street in Baltimore eating a snack.  \n243.  Baltimore Police Department Officer Willie N. Kennedy Jr. stopped his bicycle in \nfront of Chapman.  Kennedy arrested Chapman for littering, claiming that Chapman had \ndropped a packet of sweet and sour sauce on the sidewalk.   \n244.  Officer Kennedy walked Chapman to a nearby police substation and placed \nChapman in a makeshift cell, which appeared previously to have been a walk-in freezer.  \nChapman was told that he had been arrested for littering. \n245.  Approximately one hour later, Chapman was transferred to CBIC, arriving at \napproximately 8:00 p.m.   \n4 3 \n\n246.  At CBIC, in the presence of eight to ten other detainees, Chapman was \nsubjected to a humiliating and non-private strip search by Officer Does Q and R.  Chapman \nwas forced to remove all clothing except his underwear.   \n247.  This strip search was conducted despite the lack of probable cause or \nindividualized suspicion that Chapman posed a threat to the security of the facility.  This \nsearch revealed no drugs, weapons or contraband.   \n248.  After this strip search, Chapman was confined to a small filthy cell with more \nthan ten other detainees with an open toilet and a single bench. \n249.  Chapman was released at approximately 6:00 a.m. the next day.   \n250.  Unable to sleep in the crowded cell with no where to lie except the cement floor, \nand fearing for his safety should he fall asleep, Chapman was unable to work the next day.  \n251.  Chapman was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \nB.  The Police Department's Illegal Practices \n252.  The experiences of these individual plaintiffs are not unique.  They stem from a \nbroader policy and practice by the Police Department of arresting persons without probable \ncause in order to satisfy performance goals and to show progress in fighting crime by \nmeans of high arrest numbers. \n253.  Under the direction and oversight of the Commissioner and Deputy \nCommissioner, the Police Department has used a \"performance evaluation system\" that \ndemands that officers make a large number of arrests, regardless of the number or success \nof resulting prosecutions.  Each patrol officer is required to tally his enforcement statistics, \n4 4 \n\nincluding citations and arrests.  These numbers are then compared to averages from that \nofficer's squad and shift.  The three officers in each district with the lowest scores are \nsubject to reassignment to other districts. \n254.  Police officers generally disfavor reassignment because it can greatly disrupt \ntheir personal and professional lives. \n255.  Upon information and belief, the Police Department has a policy by which no \nautomatic disciplinary action is taken against a police officer if a plaintiff succeeds in a civil \ncase challenging the conduct of the officer. \n256.  Upon information and belief, the Police Department has no practice of \nreviewing arrests to see whether they result in successful prosecutions, nor of reviewing \narrest reports in those cases that are not prosecuted to determine whether officers had \nsufficient probable cause for the arrest or charge. \n257.  These policies create perverse incentives for police officers by rewarding those \nofficers who arrest innocent bystanders and punishing those who respect their obligations \nto the City and the public.   \n258.  These perverse incentives are unavoidable because, under the \"performance \nevaluation system,\" all arrests are counted—even those made with no basis for probable \ncause.  Furthermore, the Police Department does not punish officers for excessive numbers \nof arrests without probable cause. \n259.  Thus, under this system, an officer will not be reassigned even if every single \none of his arrests is made without probable cause, so long as his volume of arrests is not \n4 5 \n\namong the three lowest in his district.  By contrast, a different officer whose volume of arrests \nis the third lowest in his district will be reassigned even if all of his arrestees were convicted.   \n260.  The system therefore encourages all officers to make as many arrests as \npossible, regardless of their justification, to avoid transfer. \n261.  As confirmation, State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy stated at a public legislative \nhearing on January 4, 2006, that the Police Department routinely and increasingly arrests \npeople without probable cause. \n262.  To exacerbate matters, the Police Department, its Commissioner, Mr. Hamm, \nits Deputy Commissioner, the Mayor, Mr. O'Malley, and the City—though they all are or were, \nat times relevant to this lawsuit, aware of the Police Department's pattern and practice of \nillegal arrests—have failed to take adequate steps to abate the pattern and practice, despite \ntheir authority to do so.  They have failed to train and supervise police officers adequately.  \nThey have not properly encouraged arrests based on probable cause.  They have \naffirmatively encouraged overly aggressive and unlawful police tactics, by directing \nsupervisors to ensure that officers keep arrest numbers up, in the belief that a high number \nof arrests will keep the crime rate down, regardless of the quality of those arrests.  In short, \nthey have made the unconstitutional and illegal conduct worse.  \nC.  Grading the Police Department \n263.  Due to the policies and practices described above, the Baltimore Police \nDepartment has severe police accountability problems. \n264.  Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office Annual Statistical Reports indicate that, \nin 2005, the Police Department arrested 76,497 individuals without warrants.  Prosecutors \n4 6 \n\ndeclined to charge 25,293 of the arrestees.  Thus, during 2005, three out of every ten \npeople arrested without warrants in Baltimore City were not prosecuted, based solely on \na review of the charging documents by the State's Attorney, prior to any involvement by a \ndefense attorney or any decision by a court commissioner or judge.  The State's Attorney has \npublicly stated that prosecutors declined to charge about 30% of the arrestees in 2005 \nbecause, in the State's view, the case was \"legally insufficient.\" \n265.  In 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against 7,510 \npeople arrested for loitering, impeding, or obstructing pedestrian traffic during that year.  \nThose arrests account for nearly 10% of all warrantless arrests in Baltimore for that year.   \n266.  During 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against \n1,832 persons arrested for trespassing and 1,650 persons arrested for disorderly conduct, \nfailure to obey, or disturbing the peace.  Together, these arrests account for nearly another \n5% of all warrantless arrests in Baltimore for that year. \n267.  Thus, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against those \npersons arrested for often vague \"quality of life\" offenses in 2005, which amounted to nearly \n15 percent of the persons arrested without a warrant during that year. \nD.  The Effects of the Police Department's Arrest Policy on CBIC \n268.  The Police Department's pattern and practice of encouraging large numbers of \nillegal arrests causes a backlog at CBIC that leads CBIC to perform unconstitutional strip \nsearches and to subject arrestees to overcrowded conditions and extended detentions.  \n269.  CBIC was designed to handle about 60,000 bookings each year and to \naccommodate 895 arrestees at any one time.  Because of the Police Department's arrest \n4 7 \n\npolicies, it now handles more than 100,000 bookings each year and regularly holds more \nthan 1,200 arrestees at any one time.  Defendant Smith has characterized the problems at \nCBIC as a \"systems overload.\"  The overcrowding at CBIC has led to two distinct problems. \n270.  First, CBIC regularly subjects all male arrestees to public strip searches, \nwithout individualized suspicion and regardless of the arrestees' charges.  Often, these strip \nsearches are humiliating, non-private body cavity searches.  Most of these searches are not \nreasonably related to any legitimate security interest or to any reasonable suspicion of \nconcealed contraband. \n271.  Second, the backlog causes CBIC to delay, in some cases, presentment of \narrestees beyond the twenty-four hour maximum established in Maryland Rule 4-212(f).  In \nsome cases, detainees have been held at CBIC for more than forty-eight hours before \npresentment.  CBIC makes no adequate effort to structure its systems so that it can timely \nprocess all detainees even though CBIC officials are aware of its deficiencies.  Indeed, a \nconsultant's report to the State in October 2005 stated that \"no one [is] in charge\" of ensuring \nthe prompt processing of detainees at CBIC. \n272.  The Warden, Commissioner of Pretrial Services, Secretary, and State condone, \naffirmatively encourage, or knowingly fail to address these two policies and practices at \nCBIC, despite their responsibility to address them through proper training, supervising, \nmonitoring, and disciplining of staff or through the formulating, implementing, and executing \nof appropriate policies. \nE.  The Effects of the Police Department's Arrest Policy on the Arrestees \n273.  These illegal arrests, searches, and detentions traumatize arrestees. \n4 8 \n\n274.  Individuals who are illegally arrested suffer humiliation and degradation when \nthey are being dragged away in handcuffs in front of their friends, family, or neighbors.  The \nstigma of being illegally arrested can follow an arrestee for years, in part because those who \nknow an arrestee are unlikely to forget the sight of the arrestee being hauled away in \nhandcuffs in the back of a police car. \n275.  At CBIC, innocent arrestees are subjected to dehumanizing and humiliating \npublic strip searches that involve stripping down to underwear, pulling down the underwear, \nand—often—submitting to a visual body cavity search.  The searches are performed in \npublic view and alongside other detainees.  The victims of such unwarranted invasions of \nprivacy are humiliated, degraded, and stigmatized. \n276.  An individual who is arrested is often physically harmed or threatened while \ndetained at CBIC.  And the threat does not come just from other arrestees.  In May 2005, a \ndetainee was beaten to death by guards at the CBIC.  In the wake of that incident, eight CBIC \nguards were fired and the FBI has opened an investigation.  The detainee's death was \nclassified as a homicide.   \n277.  While detained at CBIC, an arrestee is held in filthy and overcrowded \nconditions with numerous other arrestees.  Cells are often so crowded that arrestees are \nforced to sleep on the floor.  In some cases, the cells are so crowded that inmates must sit \nor crouch in uncomfortable positions on unsanitary floors for hours at a time.  The \"meals\" \nare inedible. \n278.  An individual who is illegally arrested also suffers the loss of his liberty for \nhours or days.  Such detention can result in a detainee losing his job when he fails to \n4 9 \n\nappear at work and may also harm relations with family if an individual is unable to meet \nfamily obligations while illegally detained. \n279.  The presence of an arrest record, even if the arrestee is \"released without \ncharge,\" can follow an individual for years, making it difficult to obtain jobs, housing, or any \nother opportunity that may require a criminal background check. \n280.  For confirmed criminals, the prospect of spending hours or days in Central \nBooking, while unpleasant, is a cost of doing business, and does nothing to deter them from \ntheir unlawful behavior or to make Baltimore safer.  For innocent victims of these arrest \npractices, however, being unlawfully arrested can be a life-changing event. \nF.  The City's and the Police Department's Response \n281.  Despite these stories and statistics, the City and Police Department make no \napologies. \n282.  In response to repeated and persistent complaints by public officials, Baltimore \ncommunity leaders, and community groups with regard to this ongoing pattern of unlawful \narrests, the City and the Police Department have consistently refused to acknowledge that a \nproblem exists. \n283.  Moreover, former Mayor and Defendant O'Malley consistently refused to \nacknowledge that such a problem exists.     \n284.  At a community forum designed to address police practices on January 4, \n2006, then-Mayor and Defendant O'Malley proposed eliminating oversight by the State's \nAttorney's Office of individuals arrested by the Police Department. \n5 0 \n\n285.  Eliminating the oversight by the State's Attorney's Office would obviously fail to \nhave any effect on the number of illegal arrests.  Such a proposal would succeed at one \nthing, however, it would hide from the public the thousands of illegal arrests made by the \nPolice Department without probable cause. \nVI.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nA.  Count I: Facial and As Applied Challenge to the Loitering Ordinance under the \nFirst, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and \nArticles 19, 26, and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \n286.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n287.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Lowery, \nStoner, Scott, Wright, Higgs, Marcus, Horsey, Lindsay, and Crockett and the NAACP against \nthe City, the Police Department and defendants O’Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Bealefeld, Brown, \nClark, Norris, and Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, \nChin, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Does 1-100. \n288.  This is an \"as applied\" challenge to the enforcement of the Loitering Ordinance, \nBaltimore, Md., Police Ordinances art. 19, § 25-1 (2005).  In the alternative, it is a facial \nchallenge to the Loitering Ordinance itself. \n289.  The Police Department has interpreted the Loitering Ordinance incorrectly to \nallow arrests of persons engaged in no wrongdoing merely for standing on the public \nsidewalks.  By arresting persons merely for standing, the Police Department has effectuated \na policy of arrests without probable cause that a violation of the Loitering Ordinance has \noccurred in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 26 of the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights. \n5 1 \n\n290.  In the alternative, if the Police Department correctly interprets the Loitering \nOrdinance to permit an arrest when an innocent bystander merely is standing on a public \nsidewalk, the Loitering Ordinance is unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Articles 19 and 40 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights. \nB.  Count II: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for Unconstitutional \nArrests under Section 1983 \n291.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n292.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, \nLowery, Stoner, Johnson, Crockett, Scott, Wright, Higgs, Marcus, Horsey and Lindsay, and \nthe NAACP against the City, the Police Department and defendants O’Malley, Dixon, Hamm, \nBealefeld, Brown, Clark, Norris, and Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold \nJones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Does 1-100.. \n293.  Defendants the City, the Police Department, O'Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Bealefeld, \nBrown, Clark, Norris, Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, \nSouthard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 are \"persons\" within the \nmeaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n294.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of \nthe individual Plaintiffs. \n295.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, \nChin, Southard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 directly violated the \n5 2 \n\nconstitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs by arresting them without probable cause and \nunder an illegal pattern and practice. \n296.  The City, O'Malley, Mayor Dixon, the Police Department, Hamm, Commissioner \nBealefeld, Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar constitutional violations \nby implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice. \n297.  The City, Mayor Dixon, the Police Department, and Commissioner Bealefeld \nwill continue to cause similar constitutional violations by implementing, following, or failing \nto remedy the illegal pattern or practice in the future. \n298.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of their \nactions that the conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violated and continue to \nviolate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n299.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and \npractices, individual Plaintiffs suffered damages. \n300.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer damages as an actual and proximate result of \nsimilar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \nC.  Count III: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for Unconstitutional \nStrip Searches under Section 1983 \n301.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n302.  This Count is brought by individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, Lowery, \nStoner, Johnson, Crockett, Scott, Horsey, Chapman and Wright, and the NAACP against \nSecretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, Murphy, and \n5 3 \n\nOfficer Does A-R in their individual capacities.  In addition, Defendants Maynard, Smith, and \nFranks are sued in their official capacity for declaratory and prospective injunctive relief.  \nThese defendants are therefore \"persons\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n303.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of \nthe individual Plaintiffs. \n304.  Officer Does A-R directly violated the constitutional rights of the individual \nPlaintiffs by conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of them, without \nprobable cause or individualized suspicion to believe they possessed weapons or \ncontraband. \n305.  The policy of strip searching, without individualized suspicion, every person \narrested for loitering or other \"quality of life\" offenses is not necessary to protect officer safety, \nto preserve evidence, or to ensure prison security. \n306.  Secretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and \nMurphy, with deliberate indifference to the individual Plaintiffs' legal rights, established, \nimplemented, enforced, or failed to remedy an illegal and unconstitutional policy and \npractice at CBIC of conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of persons \ntemporarily detained at the center, without probable cause or individualized suspicion to \nbelieve the detainees possessed weapons or contraband. \n307.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of their \nactions that the conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violated and continue to \nviolate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n5 4 \n\n308.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and \npractices, the individual Plaintiffs suffered damages.  \n309.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat the individual Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer damages as an actual and \nproximate result of similar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \nD.  Count IV: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for Unconstitutional \nOverdetentions under Section 1983 \n310.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n311.  This Count is brought by Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton against Secretary \nMaynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy.  In this Count, \nthese Defendants are sued in their individual capacities only.  They are therefore \"persons\" \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n312.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs Howard and Braxton. \n313.  Secretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and \nMurphy, with deliberate indifference to Howard's and Braxton's legal rights, established, \nimplemented, enforced, condoned, and failed to remedy the conduct, pattern, and practice at \nCBIC of holding detainees for more than twenty-four hours without charges, presentment, or \nrelease. \n314.  It was clearly established at the time of their actions that such conduct, \npatterns, and practices violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution. \n5 5 \n\n315.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, pattern, and practice, \nPlaintiffs Howard and Braxton suffered damages. \nE.  Court V: Common Law Claim for Violations of Article 26 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights for Unconstitutional Arrests \n316.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n317.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, \nStoner, Lowery, Johnson, Crockett, Scott, Wright, Horsey, Lindsay, Marcus and Higgs, and \nthe NAACP against the City, the Police Department and defendants Mayor Dixon, O’Malley, \nHamm, Commissioner Bealefeld, Brown, Clark, Norris, and Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, \nPecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Southard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and \nDoes 1-100. \n318.  A common-law private cause of action exists to remedy Maryland constitutional \nviolations through both injunctive relief and money damages. \n319.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, \nChin, Southard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 directly violated the \nconstitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs by arresting them without probable cause and \nunder an illegal pattern and practice. \n320.  The City, the Police Department, and defendants Mayor Dixon, O'Malley, Hamm, \nCommissioner Bealefeld, Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar \nconstitutional violations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or \npractice. \n5 6 \n\n321.  The City, the Police Department, and defendants Mayor Dixon, the Police \nDepartment, and Commissioner Bealefeld will continue to cause similar constitutional \nviolations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice in the \nfuture. \n322.  The Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices violate Article 26 of the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights. \n323.  Their conduct, patterns, and practices were made with malice, ill will, improper \nmotive, and/or gross negligence. \n324.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and \npractices, the individual Plaintiffs suffered damages. \n325.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat the individual Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer harm as an actual and \nproximate result of similar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \nF.

This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n327.  This Count is brought by individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, Stoner, \nLowery, Johnson, Crockett, Scott, Horsey, Chapman and Wright, and the NAACP against the \nState, Secretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, Murphy, and \nOfficer Does A-R. \n328.  Officer Does A-R directly violated the constitutional rights of the individual \nPlaintiffs by conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of them, without \n5 7 \n\nprobable cause or individualized suspicion to believe they possessed weapons or \ncontraband. \n329.  The State, Secretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden \nFranks, and Murphy, with deliberate indifference to the legal rights of Plaintiffs Howard, \nBraxton, Wilson, Stoner, Lowery, Johnson, Crockett, Scott, Horsey, and Wright established, \nimplemented, enforced, or failed to remedy an illegal and unconstitutional policy and \npractice at CBIC of conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of persons \ntemporarily detained at the center, without probable cause or individualized suspicion to \nbelieve the detainees possessed weapons or contraband. \n330.  The conduct, patterns, and practices of strip searching without individualized \nsuspicion every arrestee brought to CBIC is not necessary to protect officer safety, to \npreserve evidence, or to ensure prison security. \n331.  The Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices were made with malice, ill \nwill, improper motive, and gross negligence. \n332.  Such conduct, patterns, and practices violate Article 26 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights. \n333.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and \npractices, the individual Plaintiffs suffered damages. \n334.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat the Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer harm as an actual and proximate result of \nsimilar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \n5 8 \n\nG.  Count VII: Common Law Claim for Violations of Article 24 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights for Unconstitutional Overdetentions \n335.

This Count is brought by Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton against the State, Mary \nAnn Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy. \n337.  A common-law private cause of action exists to remedy Maryland constitutional \nviolations through both injunctive relief and money damages. \n338.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs Howard and Braxton. \n339.  The State, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy, \nwith deliberate indifference to Howard's and Braxton's legal rights, established, \nimplemented, enforced, or failed to remedy the illegal and unconstitutional conduct of \nholding detainees for more than 24 hours at CBIC without charges, presentment, or release. \n340.  The Defendants acted with malice, ill will, improper motive, and gross \nnegligence. \n341.  Such conduct violated Rule 4-212(f) and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration \nof Rights. \n342.

In addition, the State, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, \nand Murphy have deprived Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton of liberty without consent or legal \njustification by causing them to be detained at CBIC for longer than 24 hours without \npresentment, charges, or release. \n347.  The individual Defendants acted with actual malice, ill will, improper motive, \nand gross negligence. \n348.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, the individual \nPlaintiffs suffered damages. \n349.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices of illegal arrests are \nongoing, it is likely that the individual Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer damages as \nan actual and proximate result of similar conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \n6 0 \n\nI.  Count IX: Assault and Battery for the Illegal Arrests \n350.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n351.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, \nStoner, Lowery, Higgs, Scott, Wright, Johnson, Horsey, Lindsay, Marcus and Crockett, and \nthe NAACP against the City, the Police Department, and defendants Mayor Dixon, O'Malley, \nHamm, Commissioner Bealefeld, Brown, Clark, Norris, and Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, \nPecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Joseph Chin, Michael Pinkosz, Southard, Hamilton, Mealey, \nand Officer Does 1-100. \n352.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, \nChin, Pinkosz, Southard, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 unlawfully attempted to \ncause, and succeeded in causing, harmful or offensive contacts with the individual Plaintiffs \nby using physical force to illegally arrest them. \n353.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, \nChin, Pinkosz, Southard, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 acted with actual malice, \nill will, and improper motive towards the individual Plaintiffs. \n354.

The plaintiffs, \nMARYLAND STATE CONFERENCE OF NAACP  who seek only equitable and not monetary relief for the \nBRANCHES, et al.  class, have not formally moved for class certification at \nv.  this time. \nBALTIMORE CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT, et al.    \nThe State defendants have answered the complaint; the \nCivil No. CCB–06–1863. | Dec. 1, 2006.  City defendants have filed a motion to dismiss or for \nsummary  judgment  and  a  motion  to  certify  to  the \nMaryland  Court  of  Appeals  the  question  of  the \nAttorneys and Law Firms  constitutionality of the loitering ordinance. These issues \nhave been fully briefed. \nDaniel  Alfonso  Cantu,  Dave  Merwin  Wharwood,  Jan \n  \nMeir Geht, Jason Jacob Mendro, Jason Eugene Morrow, \nFirst, the City defendants request that I deny the request \nWayne A. Schrader, Gibson Dunn and Crutcher LLP, \nfor class certification, pointing to the lack of an identified \nWashington, DC, Mitchell A. Karlan, Gibson Dunn and \nunlawful  policy  uniformly  applicable  to  the  proposed \nCrutcher LLP, New York, NY, Deborah A.

More specifically, the defendants identify \nDepartment  Legal  Affairs  Division  Joshua  Neal \nthree theories they attribute to the plaintiffs on which \nAuerbach,  Michael  Francis  Conti,  Baltimore  City \nclass certification might be based: (1) that arrests for \nDepartment  of  Law  City  Hall  William  F.

(Defs.’ Reply Mem. \nOpinion \nat 12–13.) The City defendants argue strongly, however, \n \nthat none of these theories, even if supported by the facts, \nis legally correct, as neither a prosecutor’s decision not to \nMEMORANDUM  prosecute nor a performance evaluation system based on \narrests  would  render  unlawful  an  arrest  supported  by \nprobable cause.

I am skeptical about the viability \nasserts claims against the State of Maryland, the Secretary  of certifying a class as apparently proposed, but agree \nof  the  Department  of  Public  Safety  and  Correctional \nwith the plaintiffs that it would be premature to rule when \nServices, the Commissioner of the Division of Pretrial \nno motion has been filed. \nDetention,  current  and  former  wardens  at  the  Central \n  \nBooking and Intake Center (“CBIC”), and CBIC officers, \n*2 In light of the justifiable concerns raised by the City \ncollectively “the State defendants”, for allegedly unlawful  defendants, however, the plaintiffs will be required to \nstrip searches and “over detentions” at CBIC (Counts 3, 4,  make their decision about whether to seek certification at \n6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14).

City of  certification may be justified to obtain an authoritative \nBaltimore, et al., 241 F.Supp.2d 546 (D.Md.2003) (Blake,  construction of a state law before a federal court rules on \nJ.).

On the other hand, there appears  deciding whether certification is needed. \nto be little dispute1 that the BPD is entitled to sovereign    \nimmunity from claims for monetary damages, but not  *3 A separate Order follows. \nequitable relief,2 under state law, and that the City is    \nentitled to governmental immunity for the common law   \ntorts  asserted  in  the  complaint.

That will be denied.3 The claims plainly \n1. the Motions to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment \nare sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and it \n(docket entries no. 20 and 54) are Denied in part and \nwould be premature to grant summary judgment in the \nGranted in part; and \nface  of  conflicting  affidavits  involving  what  the \n  \ndefendants agree is an “individualized and fact specific \n2. the Motion to Certify a Question (docket entry no. 19) \ninquiry”  into  probable  cause.4  Similarly,  it  would  be \nis Denied without prejudice. \npremature to decide whether any individual defendant is \n  \nentitled to qualified immunity before development of the \n\t\r  \nparticular  facts  against  which  the  defense  must  be \nevaluated. \n Footnotes \n \n1  The defendants initially assert that the BPD has sovereign immunity in all tort actions, both common law and constitutional, and \nthat the City enjoys governmental immunity when acting in a governmental capacity. (Defs.’ Mem. at 36–37, 39.) The plaintiffs do \n \nnot contest the BPD’s immunity for damages in any tort action nor do they dispute the City’s governmental immunity, but they \nargue that they can obtain equitable relief from the BPD for its constitutional torts. (Pls.’ Opp’n Mem. 37–38, 42.) The defendants \nin turn do not dispute this point, thereby reaching agreement on the scope of immunities accorded to the BPD and the City. (Defs.’ \nReply Mem. 24–25.) \n \n2  I am not currently ruling on whether the plaintiffs will ultimately be found to have standing to obtain injunctive relief. \n \n \n3  I will permit the City to file its motion to dismiss or for summary judgment as to plaintiff Evan Howard, but deny the motion for \nsummary judgment and deny in part and grant in part the motion to dismiss for the same reasons set forth in the body of this memo. \n \n \n4  Indeed, the defendants concede material factual disputes exist as to plaintiffs Stoner and Lowrey.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under a pattern and practice set and enforced by city officials, Baltimore police officers \narrest individuals without probable cause, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights. \n2.  To encourage this pattern and practice, the Baltimore City Police Department (\"Police \nDepartment\") rewards police officers with more arrests and punishes officers with fewer arrests, \nregardless of the number or success of resulting prosecutions. \n3.  As a consequence, Baltimore prosecutors decided to drop the charges against approximately \n30 percent of those arrested without a warrant in 2005 prior to any involvement by a defense attorney, \nand prior to review of the charges by a court commissioner. \n4.  The Maryland Central Booking and Intake Center (\"CBIC\") receives these arrestees for \nprocessing, and compounds the problem by conducting strip searches of male arrestees without probable \ncause or individualized suspicion that they are carrying weapons or contraband, in violation of the U.S. \nConstitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \n5.  The volume of arrests by the Police Department has caused CBIC to detain many arrestees \nbeyond the statutory time limit of 24 hours before presentment or release, in violation of Maryland Rule \n4-212(f) and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.  In some cases, the detentions have exceeded 48 hours, \nin violation of the U.S. Constitution. \n6.  These unconstitutional and illegal acts degrade, humiliate, and cause grave harm to their \nvictims.  Individuals who are arrested suffer unwarranted deprivation of personal liberty, sometimes for \ndays.  They may lose their jobs or be denied job opportunities in the future as a result of the permanent \nstigma of having a criminal charge on their record.  They suffer the humiliation of being hauled away in \n3  \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 5 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 5 of 63\nhandcuffs in front of friends, family, or neighbors.  At CBIC, they are subjected to the degradation of \nstrip searches—in many cases, visual body cavity searches—in front of other detainees.  They are \ndetained, sometimes for days at a time, in filthy, overcrowded conditions.  Then, when the State's \nAttorney declines to prosecute, they are Released Without Charge (RWOC'd), though they have \ntechnically already been charged by the police—often because the police had no right to arrest them in \nthe first place. \n7.  Despite the patently unconstitutional and illegal nature of this conduct and its detrimental \neffects on the Baltimore residents whom the laws are supposed to protect, city officials have refused to \nreform their practices.  The time has come to rein in this abuse of power and stop these unconstitutional \nand illegal acts. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331. \n9.  Venue is proper as the events complained of occurred in the Northern Division of the District \nof Maryland, and the defendants carry out business therein. \n10. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants State of Maryland (\"State\"), the Mayor \nand City Council of the City of Baltimore (\"City\"), and the Police Department because they are entities \nconsisting of or located within Maryland. \n11. This Court also has personal jurisdiction over individual Defendants Maynard, Saar, Smith, \nFranks, Murphy, O'Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Brown, Bealefeld, Clark, Norris, Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, \nNewkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Southard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, Officer Does A-R, \nand Officer Does 1-100.  Upon information and belief, Maynard, Saar, Smith, Franks, Murphy, Dixon, \nO'Malley, Hamm, Brown, Bealefeld, Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, \n4  \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 6 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 6 of 63\nChin, Southard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, Officer Does A-R, and Officer Does 1-100 maintain \ndomiciles within the State of Maryland.  In addition, this Court has personal jurisdiction over all of the \nindividual Defendants under Maryland's long-arm statute because (a) their tortious actions and \nomissions occurred and caused injury within Maryland and (b) they are (or were at the time of the illegal \nacts) all employed within Maryland, thus performing a character of work or service within Maryland.  \nIII.

The Experiences of the Individual Plaintiffs \n1.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton \n73. At approximately 8:30 p.m. on Friday, April 15, 2005, Plaintiff Evan Howard was standing \non the sidewalk that runs past his home on Poplar Grove Street in Baltimore, about a block away from \nhis front door, engaging in conversation with Plaintiff Tyrone Braxton and another friend, Correy \nAlexander. \n74. After a few minutes, Defendant Officers Jemini Jones and Doe 1 pulled up behind Braxton's \ncar in an unmarked police cruiser.  The plainclothes officers approached the three friends and asked if \nthey had any information about a recent homicide. \n1 9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 21 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 21 of 63\n75. The officers then asked Howard, Braxton, and Alexander their ages.  After revealing that he \nwas a minor, Alexander was ordered to go home, which he did. \n76. Then, without explanation, probable cause, or any legal justification, the officers conducted \npat-down searches of Howard and Braxton and placed them under arrest.  The arrests were purportedly \nfor loitering and impeding the flow of pedestrian traffic, even though neither Howard nor Braxton had \nbeen loitering and the officers had not ordered them to disperse. \n77. Officer Jemini Jones tightly bound the young men's hands with plastic handcuffs and placed \nHoward and Braxton in a vehicle for transport to CBIC. \n78. Howard and Braxton arrived at CBIC at about 10:00 p.m., where they waited for \napproximately an hour to begin the booking process.  Upon entering CBIC, they were screened with a \nmetal detector, which showed that neither carried any weapons. \n79. At approximately 11:00 p.m., Howard and Braxton were subjected to humiliating public strip \nsearches by Defendant Officers Doe A and Doe B.  Howard, Braxton, and two other detainees were \nplaced in a holding cell, ordered to remove all of their clothing down to their underpants, face the wall, \npull their underpants down to expose their buttocks, and submit to a visual body cavity search. \n80. The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion that either \nHoward or Braxton was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n81. Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Howard or Braxton during the \nsearch. \n82. After the strip search, Howard and Braxton were taken to a small, filthy, and overcrowded \ncell, where they stayed with about ten other detainees through the night.  The cell had no bathroom and \n2 0 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 22 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 22 of 63\nwas so overcrowded that both Howard and Braxton were forced to sit in uncomfortable positions on \nfilthy floors for long periods of time. \n83. At approximately 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, April 16, Howard and Braxton were taken to a \nslightly larger cell containing about 15 other detainees.  This cell was also filthy and unsanitary.  \nThroughout the day, the number of people in the cell fluctuated, frequently swelling to nearly 20.  Once \nagain, both Howard and Braxton were forced to sit in uncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long \nperiods of time. \n84. During their confinement, Howard and Braxton were provided \"meals\" in their cells three \ntimes each day.  The meals principally consisted of two slices of bread covering shiny and slimy meat, \nwhich Howard and Braxton believed to be spoiled bologna. \n85. Braxton was finally released on Sunday, April 17, at 10:00 a.m., after being held at CBIC for \n36 hours. \n86. Howard was finally released on Monday, April 18, at 4:00 a.m., after being held at CBIC for \n54 hours.  Howard, far from home and unable to contact anyone to pick him up from CBIC, was forced \nto walk back to his home in the dark at a dangerous hour of night through unfamiliar streets. \n87. Neither Howard nor Braxton was ever prosecuted for any crime or ever brought before a \ncourt commissioner.  \n2.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiff Wilson \n88. On April 10, 2006, Plaintiff Donald Wilson was sitting on the front steps of a residence in \nwhich his girlfriend and toddler son live.  He was visiting them and waiting for his younger brother, \nDarrell. \n2 1 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 23 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 23 of 63\n89. While Mr. Wilson was sitting on the steps with two friends, an unmarked police Subaru \nraced down the street in pursuit of a dirt bike.  A crowd of approximately 15 neighbors gathered along \nthe block to watch the chase. \n90. Failing to catch the bicyclist, the maroon police Subaru pulled up to the residence and Officer \nCrites and Sergeant Pecha exited the vehicle.  Officer Crites yelled, \"Everybody sit the f**k down!\"  \nEveryone in the area obeyed.  Wilson, at the time, was already sitting down. \n91. The officers began questioning the group of people, asking them where they lived and what \nthey were doing there.  Most were patted down and asked to show identification.  Wilson provided his \nidentification when requested. \n92. Crites questioned Wilson and asked whether Wilson lived there.  When Wilson firmly \nresponded in the affirmative, Crites took offense and, in a low tone of voice, threatened to \"f**k [him] \nup.\" \n93. When Wilson responded to this threat, by observing that Crites had whispered his threat \nrather than stating it aloud in front of witnesses, Crites immediately ordered Wilson to stand up.  Wilson \nasked why, and Crites responded, \"Don't f**king say nothing to me,\" and ordered Wilson to stand up \nand put his hands behind his back. \n94. Wilson complied and asked why he was being arrested.  Crites responded, \"Don't worry \nabout it.  You're going to jail.\" \n95. Wilson asked Crites for his name and badge number.  Crites replied, \"911.\" \n96. Crites placed metal handcuffs on Wilson and ordered him to sit on the ground.  At that time, \ntwo marked police cruisers arrived at the scene, and two additional officers exited those vehicles. \n97. Wilson asked his girlfriend to call his mother, and then he remained calm and quiet. \n2 2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 24 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 24 of 63\n98. The police began to tell people to leave.  After about 15 minutes, Wilson's mother arrived.  \nShe politely asked who the officer in charge was.  Sgt. Pecha responded that he was in charge.  Wilson's \nmother asked what her son was being detained for.  Pecha asked for Wilson's age, and when his mother \nsaid, \"21,\" Pecha stated that he did not have to give her any information because Wilson was not a \nminor.  Upon further questioning, Pecha continued to refuse to explain why Wilson was arrested. \n99. Wilson's mother therefore went to talk with her son, who explained what had happened.  \nAfter about two minutes, Pecha came over and told her that she had to leave or she would be arrested.  \nWhen she asked for Pecha's name and badge number, Pecha ignored her. \n100.  Crites and Pecha did not have nametags on and their badges were tucked inside their \nshirts to hide identifying information. \n101.  Crites put Wilson in the police car and transported him to CBIC at approximately 9:15 \np.m. \n102.  At CBIC, Wilson was taken to a waiting room, where he was ordered to strip down to his \nboxers and searched by Officer Does C-D.  A Latino man next to him in the same room was completely \nnaked. \n103.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion that \nWilson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  Indeed, no contraband was found in his \npossession. \n104.  Wilson was finally released from CBIC at around 2:00 a.m. the next day.  He was not \nallowed to use a phone at CBIC, so he walked to the nearest pay phone to call his mother. \n105.  Wilson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court commissioner. \n2 3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 25 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 25 of 63\n106.  On April 5, 2007 in the late afternoon, Donald Wilson visited a friend on Abbottston \nRoad.  After some time at the friend's house, Wilson and his friend left to return to Wilson's house.  The \nfriend's mother called her son back in just as the two men were leaving the house.  Wilson stood outside \nwaiting for his friend to rejoin him. \n107.  As Wilson was waiting for this friend and was tying his shoe with his foot on the stoop of \nthe neighboring property, two uniformed officers and a plain-clothes officer approached him.  The \nofficers demanded to know why he was standing where he was.  Wilson explained that he was waiting \nfor his friend. \n108.  Unsatisfied, the officers interrogated Wilson as to whether he had drugs on him, where \nhis friends were, and other subjects.  The officers searched Wilson, patting him down and searching his \npockets.  No weapons, drugs or contraband were found by this search.  Wilson told the officers that he \nwas not carrying drugs, and indicated that he was offended that they seemed to assume that he was a \ndrug dealer.  A uniformed officer took Wilson's identification.  \n109.  Several minutes after the police arrived, Wilson's friend came out of his house and asked \nthe officers what was going on.  The officers told him to go back into his house, which he did.  Wilson's \nfriend watched the arrest from his window. \n110.  After Wilson was searched, the plain-clothes officer handcuffed Wilson, telling him that \nhe was being arrested for \"getting smart.\" \n111.  In fact, Wilson was charged with trespass on posted property, but at all times relevant \nhereto, the property was not posted with any no-trespassing signs. \n112.  Wilson asked the arresting officer for his name, but the officer ignored the request. \n2 4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 26 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 26 of 63\n113.  Wilson was transported to the Eastern District police station in a paddy wagon, where he \nwas interrogated by a police detective concerning gangs and shootings.  Wilson had no information \nrelated to the detective's questions and told him so. \n114.  Wilson was then taken to Central Booking, arriving at approximately 6:00 p.m.   \n115.  He asked the intake officer for the arresting officer's name but the request was refused. \n116.  Wilson was then subjected to a humiliating strip search by Officer Doe L.  In front of \nanother prisoner, who had been forced to undress completely, Wilson was forced to pull his pants down \nto his ankles and to allow the officer to look inside his underwear waistband.  He was also made to lift \nhis shirt for the officer.   \n117.  Officer Doe L told Wilson that his arrest was part of the BPD's \"low tolerance\" policy.   \n118.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion that \nWilson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  No contraband was found in this search. \n119.  Wilson was then confined at CIBC.  He shuttled between four different cells, which were \nso crowded that Wilson was often forced to sit or lie on the concrete floor.   \n120.  Wilson was released at approximately 3:30 a.m. on April 6, 2007, after being detained for \napproximately nine and one half hours.  \n121.  Wilson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court commissioner. \n3.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Stoner and Lowery \n122.  On May 7, 2005, Plaintiff Aaron Stoner, Plaintiff Robert Lowery, Walter Medina, Jr., and \nfour other friends and co-workers visited the city of Baltimore to celebrate Stoner's upcoming wedding.  \nAfter visiting the Inner Harbor, the group of friends left on foot in the early morning hours of May 8 to \nreturn to their hotel. \n2 5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 27 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 27 of 63\n123.  While walking back to their hotel, a marked police car containing Defendant Officers \nNewkirk and Arnold Jones drove past.  Newkirk instructed the group to \"keep moving,\" even though the \ngroup had not actually paused during the journey.  They obeyed and continued to walk back to their \nhotel. \n124.  About two minutes later, the same patrol car drove past the group.  Medina was the first \nto see the approaching car, and remarked to Stoner, \"Here comes that cop again.\" \n125.  Officer Newkirk pulled the car to the side, stopped the car, and exited.  Newkirk \nconfronted Medina, the only African-American in the group, demanding, \"What did you say, boy?\"  \nBefore Medina could answer, Newkirk pushed him against a wall. \n126.  After Newkirk pushed Medina against the wall and began to aggressively question him, \nStoner verbally protested.  Newkirk then turned toward Stoner and ran at him with his baton fortifying \nhis raised forearm.  Defendant Newkirk hit Stoner with such force as to knock Stoner off of his feet. \n127.  Newkirk then instructed Stoner and the other five men to \"keep walking.\"  Stoner obeyed \nby getting up and walking to the rest of the group. \n128.  Newkirk then issued a warning citation for loitering to Medina. \n129.  Lowery, upset at the police harassment and brutality he had witnessed, then left the \ngroup, approached Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones, and asked for Newkirk's name and badge \nnumber. \n130.  Newkirk refused to answer Lowery's question, but Defendant Arnold Jones responded by \nplacing Lowery under arrest, purportedly for \"failure to obey\" an order to cease loitering.  This arrest \nwas made without probable cause or legal justification. \n2 6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 28 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 28 of 63\n131.  Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones then drove Lowery down the block to where Stoner, \nhaving obeyed Newkirk's earlier order to \"keep walking,\" was walking with his party.  The officers then \narrested Stoner as well. \n132.  Stoner's arrest was also purportedly for \"failure to obey\" an order to cease loitering.  This \narrest was made without probable cause or legal justification. \n133.  Stoner and Lowery were both subjected to pat-down searches, which revealed they were \ncarrying no contraband or weapons. \n134.  Medina, who had been issued a warning citation for loitering, and the other four members \nof the original group were permitted to continue walking back to the hotel. \n135.  Stoner and Lowery were transported to CBIC, where they were processed and subjected \nto another pat-down search that revealed them to be free of contraband and weapons. \n136.  Despite the negative results of the searches, Defendant Corrections Officers Doe E and \nDoe F subjected Stoner and Lowery to humiliating public strip searches at CBIC. \n137.  Stoner and Lowery, along with two other detainees, were ordered to strip to their \nunderpants while the officers conducted the search. \n138.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion that \neither Stoner or Lowery was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n139.  Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Stoner or Lowery during the \nsearch. \n140.  Both Stoner and Lowery were held in small, filthy, and overcrowded cells that were \npacked with other detainees.  Both Stoner and Lowery were forced to sit or crouch in uncomfortable \npositions on filthy floors for long periods of time because of the overcrowded conditions. \n2 7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 29 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 29 of 63\n141.  Stoner and Lowery were released from CBIC at approximately 8:00 p.m. on May 8, after \nbeing detained for 17 hours. \n142.  Neither Stoner nor Lowery was ever prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner.  \n4.  The Illegal Arrest and Search of Timothy Johnson \n143.  In the early morning hours of June 25, 2006, Timothy Johnson and three acquaintances \nwere walking down the street towards their hotel, the Baltimore Waterfront Marriott.   \n144.  Johnson and his three colleagues were in Baltimore to attend the Annual Scientific \nMeeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism. \n145.  While walking down the street, Johnson and his acquaintances encountered a woman \nwhom they did not know, who was walking in the same direction.  Because they were traveling in the \nsame direction, the five pedestrians would have appeared to be a single group. \n146.  Concerned that the woman should not be walking alone late at night in the area, and \nassuming that she was a fellow attendee at the conference, one of Johnson's colleagues told the woman \nthat they were walking back to the hotel and asked if she wanted to walk with them. \n147.  A marked police cruiser then drove up and stopped near the group, and one officer asked \nif everything was okay.  Some members of the group responded, \"Yes.\" \n148.  The officer then asked, referring to the woman who had just joined the group, \"Is she \nwith you?\"  One of Johnson's acquaintances informed the officer that the woman had just joined them. \n149.  The officer then began questioning the woman, who responded to his questions while \ncontinuing to walk.  The officer exited his vehicle, ordered the woman to stop, and then directed \nJohnson and his friends to keep walking. \n2 8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 30 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 30 of 63\n150.  The group continued walking, although they were concerned for the well-being of the \nwoman, who kept saying that she just wanted to go back to the hotel. \n151.  At the end of the block, Johnson turned around to see the officer handcuffing the woman. \n152.  While Johnson was waiting to cross the street, the officer yelled for Johnson to come \nback, and Johnson complied. \n153.  Johnson had not said a word to the officer, nor had he said anything loudly about the \nofficer or about the situation.  He assumed that he would be questioned about the woman or would be a \nwitness to the arrest. \n154.  At that time, another uniformed officer and two plainclothes officers arrived on the scene.  \nThey ordered Johnson to stop, subjected him to a pat-down search, and asked him to sit down on the \ncurb.   \n155.  No contraband was found during the pat-down search. \n156.  The first officer then told the other officers that \"these people were hindering\" and that \nthey hadn't moved fast enough.  The officers also joked that they were going to deliver the woman \"back \nto her boyfriend in chains.\" \n157.  Johnson was then placed under arrest, subjected to a second pat-down search, and placed \nin a vehicle bound for Central Booking.  Once again, no contraband was found. \n158.  Johnson was then transported to CBIC, where he was booked and fingerprinted. \n159.  Despite the negative results of the previous pat-down searches, Mr. Johnson was \nsubjected to a humiliating strip search by Officer Does G and H, during which he was required to \nremove all of his clothing except a T-shirt. \n2 9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 31 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 31 of 63\n160.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion that \nJohnson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n161.  Indeed, no contraband was found in Johnson's possession during the search. \n162.  After the illegal strip search, Johnson was held with two other men in a small, filthy cell \ndesigned for only one detainee.  He was released at 8:30 a.m., after being in custody for approximately \nsix hours. \n163.  Johnson's release came a mere thirty minutes before he was scheduled to give a \npresentation at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism, the reason for his \ntrip to Baltimore. \n164.  Johnson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court commissioner. \n5.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Tavis Crockett \n165.  At approximately 5:45 p.m. on July 23, 2006, Tavis Crockett and approximately six other \nyoung men from his neighborhood were sitting on the front steps of a friend's building, getting ready to \nwatch a neighborhood game of basketball.  \n166.  As the group began to get up and move toward the basketball courts, a number of police \ncruisers pulled up and Officer Grey exited his cruiser. \n167.  Officer Grey asked the group where Brandon was.  Upon information and belief, \nBrandon is a young man in the neighborhood that the police believe to be a drug dealer. \n168.  Brandon was not present, although the young men had seen him walk by earlier in the \nday. \n169.  Upon learning that Brandon was not present, Officer Grey told all seven young men that \nthey were being arrested for loitering.   \n3 0 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 32 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 32 of 63\n170.  Officer Grey and approximately ten other police officers then took all seven young men \ninto custody.  All seven boys were subjected to pat-down searches, which revealed no weapons, drugs, \nor contraband. \n171.  The arrests were not preceded by a warning that the young men were loitering, or by a \ndirective to move along. \n172.  When the young men arrived at the police station, three of them were let go because they \nwere juveniles.  Crockett and the other three non-minors were transported to CBIC. \n173.  At CBIC, Defendant Corrections Officers Doe I and Doe J subjected Crockett to a \nhumiliating public strip search. \n174.  Crockett, along with another detainee, was ordered to strip to his underpants while the \nofficers conducted the search. \n175.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion that \nCrockett was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n176.

Crockett was released from CBIC at approximately 8:00 a.m. on July 24, after being \ndetained for 14 hours. \n179.  Crockett was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court commissioner. \n180.  On August 22, 2006, at about 8:50 p.m., Crockett was walking from his Aunt's house to a \nnearby convenience store near Carey Street and Riggs Avenue in Baltimore, a distance of approximately \none block. \n3 1 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 33 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 33 of 63\n181.  As Crockett walked to the convenience store he was stopped by four plain-clothes police \nofficers.   \n182.  One of the officers told Crockett, \"Come on, you're going downtown with us.\"  Crockett \nasked the officer why he was being arrested.  The officer told Crockett that he had littered.   \n183.  Crockett told the officer that he was not aware that he had dropped anything, and offered \nto pick up a food wrapper the officer claimed Crockett had dropped.  The officer did not let Crockett \npick up the wrapper.   \n184.  Crockett was searched on the sidewalk, and then taken to the Western District station, \nwhere he was held in a cell with two other detainees.  He remained in this cell for four hours.  The police \ndenied Crockett's request to call his mother.   \n185.  At approximately midnight, Crockett was transported to CBIC, handcuffed, in a paddy \nwagon.   \n186.

Crockett was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court commissioner. \n6.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Raffic Scott and Kerrell Wright \n192.  At approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 30, 2006 Raffic Scott, Kerrell Wright and \napproximately five fellow members of their church, the Israelite Church of God and Jesus Christ, were \nhanding out religious literature on a sidewalk on Belair Road and Erdman Avenue in Baltimore.  The \nchurch members periodically engage in sidewalk proselytizing to spread their religious message.  When \ndoing so, they generally wear distinctive robes that signify their church membership. \n193.  Officers Chin and Southard approached the group in a squad car and demanded to know \nwhat they were doing.  Scott responded that he and his group were handing out religious literature.   \n194.  When the police approached, Wright began videotaping the encounter, as is the Church’s \npractice due to frequent police harassment. \n195.  After demanding that Wright cease video recording, and claiming that it was illegal to \nvideotape police officers without permission from the officer or from police headquarters, Officer Chin \ndemanded that Wright produce identification.  In order to do so, Wright passed the video camera to \nScott. \n196.  An officer then told Mr. Scott that he had to cease filming.  When Scott refused, Officer \nChin told Scott to put his hands on this head and pushed Scott against a wall. \n197.  Officer Chin forcibly removed Scott's religious clothing, throwing his headpiece, robe \nand belt to the ground.   \n198.  Scott was searched on the scene.  This search revealed no drugs, weapons, or contraband.   \n199.  Wright was also arrested.  He was thrown to the ground and had his religious clothing \nremoved and also thrown to the ground. \n3 3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 35 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 35 of 63\n200.  Wright was searched on the scene.  This search revealed no drugs, weapons, or \ncontraband.   \n201.  As Scott and Wright were being arrested, approximately eight officers arrived on the \nscene in several squad cars, blocking the adjacent intersection. \n202.  During or before their arrests, neither Scott, Wright, nor any other member of their group \nwas told by the police that any of them was loitering or was instructed to move on. \n203.  Scott was transported to the Northern District precinct.  During his confinement there \nScott was verbally abused by police officers on the subject of his religious beliefs.   \n204.  Scott was then transported to the CBIC, where he was subjected to a humiliating and \ngratuitously invasive strip search by Defendant Corrections Officers Doe K and Doe N.  In the presence \nof another detainee, who was also being strip searched at the same time, Scott was forced to strip to his \nunderwear.  He was made to squat in front of Officers Doe K and Doe N, while they looked inside of \nScott's underwear. \n205.  After his arrest, Wright was also taken to CBIC.  At CBIC, Wright was also subjected to \na humiliating strip search.  In the presence of two jail administrators, Officer Doe O forced Wright to \nremove his shirt and jeans. \n206.

Higgs posted her signs and stood near Chase House, a designated polling place for the \nprimary.   \n211.  She stood outside the area near Chase House, marked by signs posted by election \nofficials, where no electioneering was permitted that day.  An election judge had confirmed to Higgs \nthat she was in compliance with election regulations regarding proximity to a polling place. \n212.  Officer Pinkosz arrived at Chase House in a squad car.  He approached Ms. Higgs and \nasked her why she was picketing.  She said that she was not picketing but rather handing out campaign \nliterature for her candidate. \n213.  Officer Pinkosz left Higgs and went inside the polling place.  He reemerged and told Ms. \nHiggs that her campaigning was illegal.   \n214.  When Higgs pointed out that she stood outside the \"no electioneering\" signs and was thus \nin compliance with the law, Officer Pinkosz removed the sign from where it was planted, and without \ntaking any measurements, moved it significantly farther than 100 feet away from the polling place.   \n215.  Higgs then moved, to remain outside the boundary of another sign setting campaigning \nboundaries.  She also asked Officer Pinkosz for his name and badge number.   \n216.  At this point, Officer Pinkosz demanded her identification.   \n3 5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 37 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 37 of 63\n217.

He told her that she \nwas being arrested for loitering. \n218.  Higgs was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court commissioner. \n  8.  The Illegal Arrest and Search of Armondo Horsey, and the Illegal Arrest of    \n  Jonathan Lindsay \n \n219.  On July 22, 2007, after a late night out, Armondo Horsey, Jonathan Lindsay, and \nHorsey's brother had ordered a pizza at a pizza shop in the Canton section of Baltimore. \n220.  While eating, Horsey, Lindsay, and Horsey's brother noticed Baltimore Police \nDepartment officers detaining a man on a nearby corner.  They observed five officers forcefully \nrestraining a man in handcuffs who was lying on the ground. \n221.  Lindsay moved closer to the scene and pulled out his cell phone as if to film the arrest, \nbecause he believed the officers were using excessive force.  Two officers at the scene observed him \nwith his phone, and told him that he was not allowed to take photographs. \n222.  When Horsey observed Lindsay speaking with the officers, he was concerned that \nLindsay was protesting the officers’ use of force, and told him not to get into an argument, but just to get \nthe officers’ names and badge numbers.   \n223.  A Baltimore Police Department officer who overheard Horsey’s comment singled him \nout from among the crowd of onlookers and told him that he was going to jail with the man being \nrestrained.  \n224.  Horsey was then forcefully handcuffed behind his back and pulled backward toward a \npolice van.   \n3 6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 38 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 38 of 63\n225.  Horsey was searched at the scene of his arrest.  The search revealed no drugs, contraband \nor weapons. \n226.  When Lindsay, standing nearby, then called out that Horsey “didn’t even do anything,” a \nBaltimore Police Department officer singled Lindsay out from among the crowd of onlookers and placed \nhim in handcuffs.  While in handcuffs an officer searched Lindsay’s pockets, pulled out his cell phone, \nand opened it up and scrolled through it to see whether there were any photographs or film of the scene \ncaptured on it. \n227.  Horsey, Lindsay, and the man who was being restrained on the ground were then placed \nin a police van and transported to CBIC.  A police officer told Lindsay that he shouldn’t worry about \nbeing arrested because he would be released in a few hours.  \n228.  At CBIC, Horsey and Lindsay were shuffled among numerous overcrowded jail cells \nwith open toilets reeking of excrement. \n229.  At CBIC Officer Doe P strip searched Horsey.  Horsey was made to remove his pants, \nand Officer Doe P had Horsey open his waistband and looked into Horsey's underwear.  The strip search \nwas conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion that Horsey was carrying weapons, \ndrugs, or contraband.  The strip search revealed no drugs, weapons or contraband. \n230.  Horsey and Lindsay were both held at CBIC for about six hours. \n231.  Neither Horsey nor Lindsay was ever prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner.  Horsey and Lindsay later learned that Officer Mealey had charged them with failure to \nobey. \n3 7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 39 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 39 of 63\n9.  The Illegal Arrest of Erin Marcus \n232.  On October 12, 2007, Erin Marcus, along with seven other members of the Baltimore \nAnimal Rights Coalition (BARC), arrived at Salt Restaurant in Baltimore City to stage a peaceful protest \nregarding the restaurant’s use of foie gras.   \n233.  The members arrived outside of the restaurant at approximately 7:30 p.m.  They stood \nclear of the entrance, and did not obstruct the walkway in front of the restaurant.   \n234.  Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes after their arrival two Baltimore Police \nDepartment officers arrived at the scene.  The officers told the BARC members that if they did not cross \nthe street they would be subject to arrest. \n235.  A BARC member then spoke with police officers and explained that he had contacted the \nOffice of Licensing and Permits and was told that the group did not need a permit to protest.  Another \nBARC member attempted to review the Baltimore City loitering ordinance with the officers, including a \nshift commander who arrived on the scene, in order to establish their legal right to be there. The officers \nwere not persuaded and again told all BARC members to cross the street or face arrest. \n236.  All but three BARC members crossed the street and continued protesting on the other \nside of the street.  Marcus and the other protesters who did not cross the street were arrested. \n237.  Marcus was asked for identification by two female officers.  She showed the officers her \ndriver's license.  One of the female officers frisked Marcus and checked her bag.

Kennedy Jr. stopped his bicycle in front \nof Chapman.  Kennedy arrested Chapman for littering, claiming that Chapman had dropped a packet of \nsweet and sour sauce on the sidewalk.   \n244.  Officer Kennedy walked Chapman to a nearby police substation and placed Chapman in \na makeshift cell, which appeared previously to have been a walk-in freezer.  Chapman was told that he \nhad been arrested for littering. \n245.  Approximately one hour later, Chapman was transferred to CBIC, arriving at \napproximately 8:00 p.m.   \n246.  At CBIC, in the presence of eight to ten other detainees, Chapman was subjected to a \nhumiliating and non-private strip search by Officer Does Q and R.  Chapman was forced to remove all \nclothing except his underwear.   \n247.  This strip search was conducted despite the lack of probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that Chapman posed a threat to the security of the facility.  This search revealed no drugs, \nweapons or contraband.   \n3 9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 41 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 41 of 63\n248.  After this strip search, Chapman was confined to a small filthy cell with more than ten \nother detainees with an open toilet and a single bench. \n249.  Chapman was released at approximately 6:00 a.m. the next day.   \n250.  Unable to sleep in the crowded cell with no where to lie except the cement floor, and \nfearing for his safety should he fall asleep, Chapman was unable to work the next day.  \n251.  Chapman was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court commissioner. \nB.  The Police Department's Illegal Practices \n252.  The experiences of these individual plaintiffs are not unique.  They stem from a broader \npolicy and practice by the Police Department of arresting persons without probable cause in order to \nsatisfy performance goals and to show progress in fighting crime by means of high arrest numbers. \n253.  Under the direction and oversight of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, the \nPolice Department has used a \"performance evaluation system\" that demands that officers make a large \nnumber of arrests, regardless of the number or success of resulting prosecutions.  Each patrol officer is \nrequired to tally his enforcement statistics, including citations and arrests.  These numbers are then \ncompared to averages from that officer's squad and shift.  The three officers in each district with the \nlowest scores are subject to reassignment to other districts. \n254.  Police officers generally disfavor reassignment because it can greatly disrupt their \npersonal and professional lives. \n255.  Upon information and belief, the Police Department has a policy by which no automatic \ndisciplinary action is taken against a police officer if a plaintiff succeeds in a civil case challenging the \nconduct of the officer. \n4 0 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 42 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 42 of 63\n256.  Upon information and belief, the Police Department has no practice of reviewing arrests \nto see whether they result in successful prosecutions, nor of reviewing arrest reports in those cases that \nare not prosecuted to determine whether officers had sufficient probable cause for the arrest or charge. \n257.  These policies create perverse incentives for police officers by rewarding those officers \nwho arrest innocent bystanders and punishing those who respect their obligations to the City and the \npublic.   \n258.  These perverse incentives are unavoidable because, under the \"performance evaluation \nsystem,\" all arrests are counted—even those made with no basis for probable cause.  Furthermore, the \nPolice Department does not punish officers for excessive numbers of arrests without probable cause. \n259.  Thus, under this system, an officer will not be reassigned even if every single one of his \narrests is made without probable cause, so long as his volume of arrests is not among the three lowest in \nhis district.  By contrast, a different officer whose volume of arrests is the third lowest in his district will \nbe reassigned even if all of his arrestees were convicted.   \n260.  The system therefore encourages all officers to make as many arrests as possible, \nregardless of their justification, to avoid transfer. \n261.  As confirmation, State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy stated at a public legislative hearing \non January 4, 2006, that the Police Department routinely and increasingly arrests people without \nprobable cause. \n262.  To exacerbate matters, the Police Department, its Commissioner, Mr. Hamm, its Deputy \nCommissioner, the Mayor, Mr. O'Malley, and the City—though they all are or were, at times relevant to \nthis lawsuit, aware of the Police Department's pattern and practice of illegal arrests—have failed to take \nadequate steps to abate the pattern and practice, despite their authority to do so.  They have failed to \n4 1 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 43 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 43 of 63\ntrain and supervise police officers adequately.  They have not properly encouraged arrests based on \nprobable cause.  They have affirmatively encouraged overly aggressive and unlawful police tactics, by \ndirecting supervisors to ensure that officers keep arrest numbers up, in the belief that a high number of \narrests will keep the crime rate down, regardless of the quality of those arrests.  In short, they have made \nthe unconstitutional and illegal conduct worse.  \nC.  Grading the Police Department \n263.  Due to the policies and practices described above, the Baltimore Police Department has \nsevere police accountability problems. \n264.  Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office Annual Statistical Reports indicate that, in 2005, \nthe Police Department arrested 76,497 individuals without warrants.  Prosecutors declined to charge \n25,293 of the arrestees.  Thus, during 2005, three out of every ten people arrested without warrants in \nBaltimore City were not prosecuted, based solely on a review of the charging documents by the State's \nAttorney, prior to any involvement by a defense attorney or any decision by a court commissioner or \njudge.  The State's Attorney has publicly stated that prosecutors declined to charge about 30% of the \narrestees in 2005 because, in the State's view, the case was \"legally insufficient.\" \n265.  In 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against 7,510 people \narrested for loitering, impeding, or obstructing pedestrian traffic during that year.  Those arrests account \nfor nearly 10% of all warrantless arrests in Baltimore for that year.   \n266.  During 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against 1,832 \npersons arrested for trespassing and 1,650 persons arrested for disorderly conduct, failure to obey, or \ndisturbing the peace.  Together, these arrests account for nearly another 5% of all warrantless arrests in \nBaltimore for that year. \n4 2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 44 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 44 of 63\n267.  Thus, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against those persons \narrested for often vague \"quality of life\" offenses in 2005, which amounted to nearly 15 percent of the \npersons arrested without a warrant during that year. \nD.  The Effects of the Police Department's Arrest Policy on CBIC \n268.  The Police Department's pattern and practice of encouraging large numbers of illegal \narrests causes a backlog at CBIC that leads CBIC to perform unconstitutional strip searches and to \nsubject arrestees to overcrowded conditions and extended detentions.  \n269.  CBIC was designed to handle about 60,000 bookings each year and to accommodate 895 \narrestees at any one time.  Because of the Police Department's arrest policies, it now handles more than \n100,000 bookings each year and regularly holds more than 1,200 arrestees at any one time.  Defendant \nSmith has characterized the problems at CBIC as a \"systems overload.\"  The overcrowding at CBIC has \nled to two distinct problems. \n270.  First, CBIC regularly subjects all male arrestees to public strip searches, without \nindividualized suspicion and regardless of the arrestees' charges.  Often, these strip searches are \nhumiliating, non-private body cavity searches.  Most of these searches are not reasonably related to any \nlegitimate security interest or to any reasonable suspicion of concealed contraband. \n271.  Second, the backlog causes CBIC to delay, in some cases, presentment of arrestees \nbeyond the twenty-four hour maximum established in Maryland Rule 4-212(f).  In some cases, detainees \nhave been held at CBIC for more than forty-eight hours before presentment.  CBIC makes no adequate \neffort to structure its systems so that it can timely process all detainees even though CBIC officials are \naware of its deficiencies.  Indeed, a consultant's report to the State in October 2005 stated that \"no one \n[is] in charge\" of ensuring the prompt processing of detainees at CBIC. \n4 3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 45 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 45 of 63\n272.  The Warden, Commissioner of Pretrial Services, Secretary, and State condone, \naffirmatively encourage, or knowingly fail to address these two policies and practices at CBIC, despite \ntheir responsibility to address them through proper training, supervising, monitoring, and disciplining of \nstaff or through the formulating, implementing, and executing of appropriate policies. \nE.  The Effects of the Police Department's Arrest Policy on the Arrestees \n273.  These illegal arrests, searches, and detentions traumatize arrestees. \n274.  Individuals who are illegally arrested suffer humiliation and degradation when they are \nbeing dragged away in handcuffs in front of their friends, family, or neighbors.  The stigma of being \nillegally arrested can follow an arrestee for years, in part because those who know an arrestee are \nunlikely to forget the sight of the arrestee being hauled away in handcuffs in the back of a police car. \n275.  At CBIC, innocent arrestees are subjected to dehumanizing and humiliating public strip \nsearches that involve stripping down to underwear, pulling down the underwear, and—often—\nsubmitting to a visual body cavity search.  The searches are performed in public view and alongside \nother detainees.  The victims of such unwarranted invasions of privacy are humiliated, degraded, and \nstigmatized. \n276.  An individual who is arrested is often physically harmed or threatened while detained at \nCBIC.  And the threat does not come just from other arrestees.  In May 2005, a detainee was beaten to \ndeath by guards at the CBIC.  In the wake of that incident, eight CBIC guards were fired and the FBI has \nopened an investigation.  The detainee's death was classified as a homicide.   \n277.  While detained at CBIC, an arrestee is held in filthy and overcrowded conditions with \nnumerous other arrestees.  Cells are often so crowded that arrestees are forced to sleep on the floor.  In \n4 4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 46 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 46 of 63\nsome cases, the cells are so crowded that inmates must sit or crouch in uncomfortable positions on \nunsanitary floors for hours at a time.  The \"meals\" are inedible. \n278.  An individual who is illegally arrested also suffers the loss of his liberty for hours or \ndays.  Such detention can result in a detainee losing his job when he fails to appear at work and may also \nharm relations with family if an individual is unable to meet family obligations while illegally detained. \n279.  The presence of an arrest record, even if the arrestee is \"released without charge,\" can \nfollow an individual for years, making it difficult to obtain jobs, housing, or any other opportunity that \nmay require a criminal background check. \n280.  For confirmed criminals, the prospect of spending hours or days in Central Booking, \nwhile unpleasant, is a cost of doing business, and does nothing to deter them from their unlawful \nbehavior or to make Baltimore safer.  For innocent victims of these arrest practices, however, being \nunlawfully arrested can be a life-changing event. \nF.  The City's and the Police Department's Response \n281.  Despite these stories and statistics, the City and Police Department make no apologies. \n282.  In response to repeated and persistent complaints by public officials, Baltimore \ncommunity leaders, and community groups with regard to this ongoing pattern of unlawful arrests, the \nCity and the Police Department have consistently refused to acknowledge that a problem exists. \n283.  Moreover, former Mayor and Defendant O'Malley consistently refused to acknowledge \nthat such a problem exists.     \n284.  At a community forum designed to address police practices on January 4, 2006, then-\nMayor and Defendant O'Malley proposed eliminating oversight by the State's Attorney's Office of \nindividuals arrested by the Police Department. \n4 5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 47 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 47 of 63\n285.  Eliminating the oversight by the State's Attorney's Office would obviously fail to have \nany effect on the number of illegal arrests.  Such a proposal would succeed at one thing, however, it \nwould hide from the public the thousands of illegal arrests made by the Police Department without \nprobable cause. \nVI.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nA.  Count I: Facial and As Applied Challenge to the Loitering Ordinance under the \nFirst, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Articles 19, \n26, and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \n286.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n287.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Lowery, Stoner, \nScott, Wright, Higgs, Marcus, Horsey, Lindsay, and Crockett and the NAACP against the City, the \nPolice Department and defendants O’Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Bealefeld, Brown, Clark, Norris, and \nOfficers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Pinkosz, Hamilton, \nMealey, and Does 1-100. \n288.  This is an \"as applied\" challenge to the enforcement of the Loitering Ordinance, \nBaltimore, Md., Police Ordinances art. 19, § 25-1 (2005).  In the alternative, it is a facial challenge to the \nLoitering Ordinance itself. \n289.  The Police Department has interpreted the Loitering Ordinance incorrectly to allow \narrests of persons engaged in no wrongdoing merely for standing on the public sidewalks.  By arresting \npersons merely for standing, the Police Department has effectuated a policy of arrests without probable \ncause that a violation of the Loitering Ordinance has occurred in violation of the Fourth Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution and Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \n4 6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 48 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 48 of 63\n290.  In the alternative, if the Police Department correctly interprets the Loitering Ordinance to \npermit an arrest when an innocent bystander merely is standing on a public sidewalk, the Loitering \nOrdinance is unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution, and Articles 19 and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \nB.  Count II: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for Unconstitutional \nArrests under Section 1983 \n291.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n292.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, Lowery, \nStoner, Johnson, Crockett, Scott, Wright, Higgs, Marcus, Horsey and Lindsay, and the NAACP against \nthe City, the Police Department and defendants O’Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Bealefeld, Brown, Clark, \nNorris, and Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Pinkosz, \nHamilton, Mealey, and Does 1-100.. \n293.  Defendants the City, the Police Department, O'Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Bealefeld, Brown, \nClark, Norris, Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Southard, \nPinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 are \"persons\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983. \n294.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of the \nindividual Plaintiffs. \n295.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, \nSouthard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 directly violated the constitutional rights \nof the individual Plaintiffs by arresting them without probable cause and under an illegal pattern and \npractice. \n4 7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 49 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 49 of 63\n296.  The City, O'Malley, Mayor Dixon, the Police Department, Hamm, Commissioner \nBealefeld, Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar constitutional violations by \nimplementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice. \n297.  The City, Mayor Dixon, the Police Department, and Commissioner Bealefeld will \ncontinue to cause similar constitutional violations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the \nillegal pattern or practice in the future. \n298.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of their actions that \nthe conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violated and continue to violate the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n299.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices, \nindividual Plaintiffs suffered damages. \n300.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely that \nPlaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer damages as an actual and proximate result of similar \nunconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \nC.  Count III: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for Unconstitutional Strip \nSearches under Section 1983 \n301.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n302.  This Count is brought by individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, Lowery, Stoner, \nJohnson, Crockett, Scott, Horsey, Chapman and Wright, and the NAACP against Secretary Maynard, \nMary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, Murphy, and Officer Does A-R in their \nindividual capacities.  In addition, Defendants Maynard, Smith, and Franks are sued in their official \ncapacity for declaratory and prospective injunctive relief.  These defendants are therefore \"persons\" \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n4 8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 50 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 50 of 63\n303.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of the \nindividual Plaintiffs. \n304.  Officer Does A-R directly violated the constitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs by \nconducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of them, without probable cause or \nindividualized suspicion to believe they possessed weapons or contraband. \n305.  The policy of strip searching, without individualized suspicion, every person arrested for \nloitering or other \"quality of life\" offenses is not necessary to protect officer safety, to preserve \nevidence, or to ensure prison security. \n306.  Secretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy, \nwith deliberate indifference to the individual Plaintiffs' legal rights, established, implemented, enforced, \nor failed to remedy an illegal and unconstitutional policy and practice at CBIC of conducting \nindiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of persons temporarily detained at the center, without \nprobable cause or individualized suspicion to believe the detainees possessed weapons or contraband. \n307.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of their actions that \nthe conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violated and continue to violate the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n308.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices, the \nindividual Plaintiffs suffered damages.  \n309.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely that the \nindividual Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer damages as an actual and proximate result of \nsimilar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \n4 9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 51 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 51 of 63\nD.  Count IV: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for Unconstitutional \nOverdetentions under Section 1983 \n310.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n311.  This Count is brought by Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton against Secretary Maynard, \nMary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy.  In this Count, these Defendants are \nsued in their individual capacities only.  They are therefore \"persons\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983. \n312.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs \nHoward and Braxton. \n313.  Secretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy, \nwith deliberate indifference to Howard's and Braxton's legal rights, established, implemented, enforced, \ncondoned, and failed to remedy the conduct, pattern, and practice at CBIC of holding detainees for more \nthan twenty-four hours without charges, presentment, or release. \n314.  It was clearly established at the time of their actions that such conduct, patterns, and \npractices violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n315.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, pattern, and practice, Plaintiffs \nHoward and Braxton suffered damages. \nE.  Court V: Common Law Claim for Violations of Article 26 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights for Unconstitutional Arrests \n316.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n317.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, Stoner, \nLowery, Johnson, Crockett, Scott, Wright, Horsey, Lindsay, Marcus and Higgs, and the NAACP against \nthe City, the Police Department and defendants Mayor Dixon, O’Malley, Hamm, Commissioner \n5 0 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 52 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 52 of 63\nBealefeld, Brown, Clark, Norris, and Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, \nHeron, Grey, Chin, Southard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Does 1-100. \n318.  A common-law private cause of action exists to remedy Maryland constitutional \nviolations through both injunctive relief and money damages. \n319.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, \nSouthard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 directly violated the constitutional rights \nof the individual Plaintiffs by arresting them without probable cause and under an illegal pattern and \npractice. \n320.  The City, the Police Department, and defendants Mayor Dixon, O'Malley, Hamm, \nCommissioner Bealefeld, Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar constitutional \nviolations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice. \n321.  The City, the Police Department, and defendants Mayor Dixon, the Police Department, \nand Commissioner Bealefeld will continue to cause similar constitutional violations by implementing, \nfollowing, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice in the future. \n322.  The Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices violate Article 26 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights. \n323.  Their conduct, patterns, and practices were made with malice, ill will, improper motive, \nand/or gross negligence. \n324.

Officer Does A-R directly violated the constitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs by \nconducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of them, without probable cause or \nindividualized suspicion to believe they possessed weapons or contraband. \n329.  The State, Secretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, \nand Murphy, with deliberate indifference to the legal rights of Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, \nStoner, Lowery, Johnson, Crockett, Scott, Horsey, and Wright established, implemented, enforced, or \nfailed to remedy an illegal and unconstitutional policy and practice at CBIC of conducting \nindiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of persons temporarily detained at the center, without \nprobable cause or individualized suspicion to believe the detainees possessed weapons or contraband. \n330.  The conduct, patterns, and practices of strip searching without individualized suspicion \nevery arrestee brought to CBIC is not necessary to protect officer safety, to preserve evidence, or to \nensure prison security. \n331.  The Defendants' conduct, patterns, and practices were made with malice, ill will, \nimproper motive, and gross negligence. \n5 2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB     Document 133-2      Filed 12/18/2007     Page 54 of 63\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 144   Filed 02/27/08   Page 54 of 63\n332.

THE LITIGATION \n1.  On July 21, 2006, the NAACP Plaintiffs (with the exception of the Plaintiffs who \njoined the case in February 2008 with the filing of an amended complaint) commenced the \nAction by filing a complaint against the Municipal Defendants and other parties alleging, among \nother things, that the Department engaged in a pattern and practice of arrests without probable \ncause in violation of the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \n2.  The NAACP Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 27, 2008, adding \nadditional Plaintiffs and Defendants. \n3.  In December 2008, the Settling Parties agreed to suspend the prosecution of the \nAction and engaged in settlement negotiations.  The Municipal Defendants, and especially the \nleadership of the Department, have worked closely and cooperatively with the NAACP Plaintiffs \nin fashioning the terms of this Agreement.  These terms are based upon four key principles: 1) \nestablishing policies and providing written guidance regarding the effective policing of Quality \nof Life Offenses; 2) training Department personnel regarding those policies; 3) tracking \ncompliance with the policies; and 4) holding Departmental personnel accountable for conduct \nviolative of the policies. \n3 \n\nCCaassee  11::0066--ccvv--0011886633--CCCCBB      DDooccuummeenntt  229956--21       FFiilleedd  0066//2295//1100      PPaaggee  44  ooff  5577\nII.  CLAIMS OF THE NAACP PLAINTIFFS \nThe NAACP Plaintiffs believe that the claims asserted in the Action have merit and that \ntheir investigation and analysis of the facts and the law in this matter support the claims asserted. \nHowever, the NAACP Plaintiffs and their counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and \nlength of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Action against the Municipal \nDefendants through trial and appeals.  Plaintiffs agree that this Agreement is a fair and \nreasonable settlement with the Municipal Defendants. \nIII.  THE MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS' DENIAL \nOF WRONGDOING AND LIABILITY \nThe Municipal Defendants have denied and continue to deny all allegations of \nwrongdoing or liability asserted against them in the Action.  Nonetheless, the Municipal \nDefendants recognize that continuing the Action through trial and appeals would be protracted \nand expensive, and that it is desirable and in the best interests of the Municipal Defendants and \nthe citizens of Baltimore, that the Action be fully and finally settled in the manner set forth \nherein. \nIV.

The \nreview shall specifically include a determination of the sufficiency of the probable cause \nunderlying each Quality of Life arrest that is associated with the conduct under review.  Based \nupon the review of related records, the supervisor shall determine, based upon a preponderance \nof the documentary evidence, whether the officer's actions are in contravention of the Policies. \nIf the result of the review is a determination that the officer's actions are in contravention of the \nPolicies, the supervisor shall refer the matter to his or her command for action consistent with the \npolicy established under section IV.B.c.2.c.  If the result of the review is a determination that the \nofficer's actions are consistent with the Policies, the supervisor shall determine the necessity, if \nany, for non-punitive counseling. \n22 \n\nCCaassee  11::0066--ccvv--0011886633--CCCCBB      DDooccuummeenntt  229956--21       FFiilleedd  0066//2295//1100      PPaaggee  2233  ooff  5577\n3.

The written directive or directives concerning Quality of Life Offenses required \nby Section IV .B.l.a.2 shall include a requirement that any time an officer effects a \ncustodial arrest for a Quality of Life Offense, the officer shall record in the \nincident report and the statement of probable cause the factual basis for his or her \ndecision to effect a custodial arrest, rather than providing counseling, a verbal \nwarning or issuing a citation.  [IV.B.l.a.2.a] \na.  The Auditor shall review a statistically meaningful sample of statements \nof probable cause required by section IV .B.l.a.2.a to determine whether the \nfactual narrative of the arrest could on its face support a finding of probable cause \nand that the arrest was in accord with the Policies. \n4.  Within 30 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department shall issue \na written directive requiring officers to provide their names and badge numbers to \nany individual who requests this information.

The lawsuit was \nbrought nearly four years ago, on behalf of the NAACP as well as 13 individual plaintiffs who \nalleged that they had been arrested without probable cause for \"quality of life\" offenses such as \nloitering and disorderly conduct. \nUnder the terms of the settlement, the Police Department has agreed to institute policies \nthat reject \"Zero-Tolerance Policing\" and establish a range of appropriate officer responses when \nfaced with minor offenses.  In addition, the Department will issue written directives that spell out \nthe elements of common minor offenses to ensure that officers are aware of the scope of their \nauthority.  Every officer will be trained on the new policies for offenses, and the Department will \nmonitor officer conduct to ensure compliance with the new policies.  The Department's efforts \nand internal monitoring under the settlement will be reviewed by an independent auditor, who \nwill file public reports regarding the Department's compliance. \nThe ACLU, NAACP, and the individual plaintiffs recognize that the Baltimore Police \nDepartment's current leadership has already taken steps to address the issues raised by this \nlawsuit and has engaged in diligent efforts to resolve this lawsuit in a positive and constructive \nmanner.  They applaud those efforts and the Department's willingness to take the additional \nsteps set forth in this agreement.  The Department recognizes that the individuals who brought \nthis lawsuit have focused their efforts on systemic reforms that the parties all believe will · \nimprove policing in Baltimore. \nThe parties have been engaged in this lawsuit for four years, and believe that it is in their \nbest interests, and the best interest of the community, to bring finality to the case.  The parties all \nwant to see a safer Baltimore, and all want effective and lawful policing.  We all believe that \npolice respect for the citizens they serve and adherence to the Constitution are essential to \nachievement of our collective goal of making our community a safer one.  The plaintiffs and the \nDepartment are gratified that this chapter has been brought to a close, and look forward to \nworking together to realize the promise of the settlement announced today. \n\"We think this agreement is an important step for the Baltimore City Police Department,\" \nsaid Dr. Marvin L. Cheatham, President of the Baltimore City Branch of the NAACP, \"and we \nappreciate the Police Commissioner's willingness to make these commitments\" \n\"I appreciate the hard work and creative thinking that was necessary to craft this \nAgreement, which is certainly in line with my overall mission for this Police Department,\" \nsaid Police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld, Ill, \"and the BPD will continue its efforts \nto strengthen its relationship with the citizens of Baltimore, and welcomes the valued \npartnership it continues to forge with the current leadership of the NAACP, which extends \nbeyond this Agreement.\" ",
