    "summary": "<p>On October 15, 2002, a man and woman represented by attorneys David G. Webbert of Augusta, Maine, and Howard Friedman of Boston, Massachusetts, filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for Maine.  The lawsuit challenged the blanket policy of conducting routine, suspicionless strip searches of all pre-arraignment detainees entering the York County (Maine) Jail. Plaintiffs maintained that with every pre-trial detainee strip searched, regardless of the offense charged and whether there was reasonable cause to believe that each detainee carried concealed weapons or contraband, the policy violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure.  Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and class certification.</p><p>The District Court (District Judge David B. Hornby) adopted and modified the report and recommendation of Magistrate Judge David M. Cohen and certified the case as a class action, with the class defined as follows:</p><p>All people strip-searched at the York County Jail after October 14, 1996, under a policy or custom of conducting strip-searches without evaluating individualized reasonable suspicion:</p><p>(1) while waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon or drugs or a violent felony; or</p><p>(2) while waiting for a first court appearance after being arrested on a default or other warrant that did not involve a weapon or drugs or a violent felony.</p><p>Nilsen v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19 (D. Me. 2003).  </p><p>Defendants appealed and the case was consolidated on appeal with Tardiff v. Knox County, a similar case pending before a different district court judge. (See JC-ME-4 of this collection).  The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the class certification orders in both cases.  Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004) (Circuit Judge Michael Boudin).</p><p>After class certification was affirmed on appeal, the parties reached a tentative settlement and moved for preliminary court approval.  Judge Hornby declined to give his preliminary approval of the settlement's provision that class members who were arrested multiple times receive no extra recovery for the resulting multiple strip searches.  Rather, he advised the parties that he would rule on the issue following the fairness hearing, which he set for August 1, 2005.  Nilsen v. York County, 228 F.R.D. 60 (D. Me. 2005).  The Judge approved the class notice on Apr 01, 2005.  Nilsen v. York County, 2005 WL 757859 (D. Me. 2005).</p><p>Following a fairness hearing on August 1, 2005, Judge Hornby approved the settlement in all respects, except the provision that called for the County to pay women twice as much as men.  Nilsen v. York County, 382 F. Supp.2d 206 (D. Me. 2005).  The parties then amended the settlement to provide equal settlement payments to male and female class members.  Because of the amendment, female class members were given a new opportunity to opt out of the settlement.  Judge Hornby approved the amended settlement.  Nilsen v. York County, 400 F. Supp.2d 265 (D. Me. 2005).</p><p>Under the terms of the amended settlement, York County agreed to pay $3.3 million to settle the class claims. Of that amount, 20 class members received incentive awards totaling $25,500 for time spent working with class counsel on the settlement.  York County also agreed to enact a new policy protecting the privacy of pre-trial detainees from illegal strip searches.  Plaintiffs' attorneys were awarded fees of $825,000 (25% of $3.3 million fund).  Nilsen v. York County, 400 F. Supp.2d 266 (D. Me. 2005).  It was estimated that there were approximately 7,500 class members.  Over 1,300 filed claims, constituting a participation rate of approximately 17.78%.</p><p>On November 30, 2005, Judge Hornsby recused himself from the case, in view of his spouse's business connections to the state.  The case was reassigned to District Judge George Z. Singal.  On June 26, 2006, Judge Singal directed the court clerk to close the case.</p><p></p>",

On August 1, 2005, I held a\nfinal fairness hearing on a proposed settlement of the lawsuit. I now approve the notice sent to the class. I also\napprove the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement in all respects but one: I cannot endorse a\nlocal government paying twice as much to women as to men, because the difference in treatment does not pass\nconstitutional muster. Although I find the settlement is in most respects a good one, the parties have not\nestablished that a gender-based difference in treatment is substantially related to an important governmental\nobjective, the constitutional standard that governs. To that extent only, I disapprove the settlement.\nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nOn October 15, 2002, individuals who had been arrested at the York County Jail (\"Jail\") filed this lawsuit under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 and asked to represent a class of plaintiffs. They challenged the Jail's practice of requiring that\nevery arrestee to be held in a housing area disrobe completely and submit to a corrections officer's visual\ninspection while changing over into a jail uniform. The plaintiffs alleged that this practice violated the Fourth\nAmendment because it was a policy or custom of \"strip searching\" arrestees without individualized suspicion.\nYork County responded, maintaining (as it does to this day) that its policy was constitutional because the officers\nwere looking for contraband in clothing and were not intentionally viewing arrestees' naked bodies.\nBoth parties conducted extensive discovery. York County responded to three sets of document requests and\ninterrogatories and one request for admissions, and deposed seventeen class members. The parties deposed a\ntotal of thirty-three individuals. The plaintiffs responded to a set of interrogatories and document requests for\neach of the three class representatives, and responded to two additional sets of interrogatories and one\nadditional set of document requests. Both parties retained jail experts and exchanged their reports. Pls.' Mot. for\nFinal Approval of Class Settlement (\"Mot. for Final Approval\") at 8-9 (Docket Item 133); id. Ex. N, Aff. of Howard\nFriedman, ¶ 22.\n\nDiscovery was disputed from the beginning of the case, when the plaintiffs had difficulty obtaining electronic\nbooking data from the Jail. The Jail initially stated that it did not have electronic booking data. The plaintiffs later\ndiscovered that the Jail did have electronic data, but that it was not in a format that the plaintiffs could access. As\ndirected by Magistrate Judge Cohen, Report of Hearing and Order Re: Discovery Dispute at 2 (Docket Item 40),\nthe plaintiffs' expert worked with the developer of the Jail's software and representatives from the Jail and was\nable to extract the data and convert it into a database. The plaintiffs used this database to find and contact\npotential class members. See Mot. for Final Approval at 6-7 (describing this discovery dispute).\nOn December 18, 2003, I certified a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). The class includes:\nAll people strip-searched at the York County Jail after October 14, 1996, under a policy or custom of conducting\nstrip-searches without evaluating individualized reasonable suspicion:\n(1) while waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being arrested on charges that did not\n210 involve *210 a weapon or drugs or a violent felony; or\n(2) while waiting for a first court appearance after being arrested on a default or other warrant that did not involve\na weapon or drugs or a violent felony.\nNilsen v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19, 20 (D.Me.2003). York County appealed and the First Circuit affirmed the\ndecision certifying the class. See Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2004).\nIn January of 2004, the plaintiffs sent York County a settlement proposal. York County did not want to discuss\nmediation until the First Circuit ruled on the class certification. After the First Circuit's decision affirming class\ncertification, Judge Cohen issued a scheduling order that required the parties to conduct mediation by the end of\nSeptember 2004. Report of Scheduling Conference and Revised Scheduling Order at 2 (Docket Item 79). The\nparties began settlement discussions with a mediator in late September, 2004, and the plaintiffs filed a notice of\nsettlement on November 29, 2004.\nOn January 24, 2005, I held a preliminary hearing on the proposed settlement. Following that hearing, I approved\nclass-wide notice of the proposed settlement after requiring the parties to provide class members with a second\nopportunity to opt out of the class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(3). I held a final fairness hearing\non August 1, 2005.\nII. SUFFICIENCY OF NOTICE\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1)(B) requires that the court \"direct notice in a reasonable manner to all\nclass members who would be bound by a proposed settlement.\" Notice meets Rule 23(e) and due process\nrequirements if it is reasonably calculated to reach the class members and inform them of the existence of and\nthe opportunity to object to the settlement. See 4 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions §\n11:53, at 164-65 (4th ed.2002); see also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 114 (2d\nCir.2005).\nThe notice program here consisted of mailed notice, print and electronic publication notice and notice posted at\nthe Jail. There were both a long-form and a short-form notice. There were two versions of the short-form notice.\nOne was published in two Maine newspapers, the York County Journal Tribune and the Portland Press Herald,\nand the other was posted at the Jail's booking area and in each of the Jail's housing units. These short forms\nsummarized the litigation and the terms of the settlement and described the process for obtaining a claim form.\nThe Jail also kept copies of the long-form notice and claim form for any prisoner who requested them. See Mot.\nfor Final Approval, Ex. I, Aff. of Myong J. Joun (\"Joun.Aff.\"), ¶¶ 19-24 (describing the notice program). The long\nform described the nature of the litigation, the class definition, the general terms of the settlement, the class\nmembers' legal rights and the process for filing a claim, and included a toll free number and a dedicated website\nfor class members who wanted additional information. The plaintiffs' lawyers mailed this long-form notice and the\nclaim form to class members and to anyone who requested the claim form through the toll-free number or the\nclaims administrator. The forms were also available on the website.\n\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers took several steps to assure that the direct mail notice reached the class members. They\ninitially obtained the class members' addresses from the Jail's electronic booking data. Mot. for Final Approval at\n211 7. Before mailing the notice of class certification, the claims administrator updated these addresses *211 with the\nchange of address database maintained by the United States Postal Service. Pls.' Supplemental Consent Mem.\nin Support of Consent Mot. for Preliminary Approval of Class Settlement (\"Supplemental Consent Mot.\") at 13\n(Docket Item 116); id. Ex. J, Aff. of Richard W. Simmons, ¶ 3. The post office returned as undeliverable forty-two\npercent of the envelopes containing notice of class certification. The claims administrator then ran those\naddresses through an online LEXIS database designed to provide updated addresses. Only thirty percent of the\ndirect mail notices of settlement ultimately were returned as undeliverable. Mot. for Final Approval, Ex. D, Aff. of\nEstelle McLean, ¶¶ 3-7.\nThis settlement also received substantial media coverage in Maine and some additional coverage in New\nHampshire and Massachusetts. The plaintiffs' lawyers issued a number of press releases about the settlement to\nvarious print and broadcast outlets and held a live press conference on the settlement. Ten days before the\ndeadline for submitting claim forms, the plaintiffs' lawyers issued another press release about the settlement and\nthe upcoming deadline. See Supplemental Consent Mem., Ex. I, Decl. of David G. Webbert, Esq., ¶¶ 11-12; Pls.'\nSecond Supplemental Consent Mem. in Support of Mot. for Final Approval at 2 (Docket Item 141).\nI find that the content of both the long-form and the short-form notices sufficiently informed the class members of\nthe proposed settlement and their options of filing a claim, seeking exclusion or objecting to the settlement. I find\nthat all forms of notice could be understood by the average class member. See 4 Conte & Newberg, supra, §\n11:53, at 167. The distribution was excellent, satisfying both Rule 23(e) and due process. Although mailed notice\nalone might have been sufficient, see, e.g., Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 175, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40\nL.Ed.2d 732 (1974); 7B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, et. al., Federal Practice &\nProcedure § 1797.6, at 200, the plaintiffs' lawyers made a considerable and highly successful effort beyond the\nmailings so as to reach as many class members as possible. They carefully chose the newspapers for publication\nnotice based on the high concentration of class members in York County (78.5% of the class) and Cumberland\nCounty (14.3% of the class). Supplemental Consent Mem., Ex. H, Aff. of Myong J. Joun, ¶ 9. Notice provided at\nthe Jail likely reached some class members who did not receive the mailed notice because they no longer lived at\nthe address known to the plaintiffs' lawyers. Other class members who did not receive the mailed notice\nnevertheless may have learned of the settlement from the media and received more information from the toll-free\nnumber and the website. After the settlement was publicized, the claims administrator received over 316\ntelephone calls and more than 1,936 visits (with 685 unique network addresses) to the dedicated website. Mot.\nfor Final Approval at 26; id. Ex. D, Aff. of Estelle McLean ¶¶ 8-12. Moreover, the efforts by the plaintiffs' lawyers to\npublicize the claim deadline appear to have reached a significant number of class members. By June 10, 2005,\nthe claims administrator estimated that 12-13% of the class would participate in the settlement, based on the\nnumber of claim forms that had been filed and were expected to be approved as well as prior experience. Seven\nweeks later, after the additional press release about the claim deadline, a large number of additional class\nmembers filed claims and the claims administrator estimated a 17.78% participation rate. Decl. of Myong J. Joun\n212 dated July 27, 2005, ¶ 4 (Docket Item 143); Joun Aff., ¶ 16. I conclude that the content *212 of the notice and the\nextensive and well-planned means of disseminating the notice satisfied Rule 23(e) and due process\nrequirements.\nIII. FAIRNESS, REASONABLENESS AND ADEQUACY OF THE\nSETTLEMENT\nUnder Rule 23(e), I can approve the proposed settlement only if it is fair, reasonable and adequate. Fed.R.Civ.P.\n23(e)(1)(C); City P'ship Co. v. Atlantic Acquisition Ltd. P'ship, 100 F.3d 1041, 1043 (1st Cir.1996); see also Wal-\nMart Stores, 396 F.3d at 116. In evaluating the settlement, I consider the following factors: (1) a comparison of\nthe proposed settlement with the likely outcome of litigation; (2) the stage at which the matter settled and the\namount of discovery completed; (3) the reaction of the class to the settlement, including the number of objectors\nand the nature of the objections; (4) the quality of the plaintiffs' lawyers; (5) the conduct of the negotiations; and\n(6) the prospects of the case, including risk, complexity, expense, and duration. See In re Compact Disc Minimum\n\nAdvertised Price Antitrust Litig., 216 F.R.D. 197, 206 (D.Me.2003) (noting that the First Circuit has not adopted a\nspecific test to evaluate class action settlements but that other circuits consider these factors); see also Wal-Mart\nStores, 396 F.3d at 117 (considering similar factors); 4 Conte & Newberg, supra, § 11:43, at 120-21. I also\nevaluate the fairness of the proposed distribution of the settlement funds among the class members. There is a\npresumption in favor of the settlement if the parties negotiated the settlement at arms-length after conducting\nmeaningful discovery. City P'ship Co., 100 F.3d at 1043; 4 Conte & Newberg, supra, § 11:41, at 90; see also Wal-\nMart Stores, 396 F.3d at 116.\n(A) Value of the Settlement\nI first compare the value of the settlement to what the plaintiffs could recover after a successful trial and appeal,\ndiscounting that potential recovery by the risk, delay, and expense of continued litigation. The value of the\nsettlement is a monetary award of $3.3 million (accruing interest), to be distributed to the class members after the\npayment of attorney fees, costs, claims administration expenses, and incentive payments to deponents and class\nrepresentatives; and a requirement that York County maintain a written policy prohibiting the challenged strip\nsearches.\nThe monetary award compares favorably to what the plaintiffs could recover at trial. York County has vigorously\ncontested liability factually from the outset, maintaining that Jail officers avoided looking at arrestees during the\nchangeover process. If the plaintiffs nevertheless succeed on liability at a trial, it will still be difficult for them to\nprove and recover damages. See, e.g., Mot. for Final Approval, Ex. B, Decl. of Charles Harvey, Esq. (\"Harvey\nDecl.\"), ¶ 10 (noting his belief that the class members may receive nothing or only very small or nominal damage\nawards from a jury). Because of the individualized nature of the damages, it is unclear how damages would even\nbe awarded following a liability determination. In affirming class certification, the First Circuit noted that the court\ncould use a formula to distribute damages, the parties could agree to modest uniform damages with a special\nmaster evaluating any more serious claims, class members could pursue damage claims in a separate lawsuit or\nthe parties could settle after a jury determined liability. Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 6-7. Any individualized determination\ncould be problematic because plaintiffs may be hesitant to testify fully and openly about any mental, emotional or\n213 other harm that they experienced *213 as a result of the search, even if they were willing to testify at trial that the\nstrip search occurred. Collecting any judgment larger than the settlement would also be difficult. This settlement\nis funded largely by insurance, and the amount available declines as York County spends more on defense costs.\nSee Harvey Decl. ¶¶ 7-8, 15 (indicating that because of insurance limitations the proposed $3.3 million award is\nthe maximum amount that the plaintiffs could have obtained in a settlement). It is challenging to recover from a\ngovernmental entity amounts that are not covered by insurance.\nThere is also value in the settlement's requirement that York County maintain a written policy prohibiting the\nchallenged searches. York County claims that the written policy does not reflect a change in the Jail's practice but\ninstead codifies the existing practice. It says that the litigation was only one factor in York County's decision to\nchange its written policy because it was already in the process of reviewing and revising many of its policies and\nprocedures. See Def.'s Response to Pls.' Mot. for Final Approval of Class Settlement (\"Def.'s Response\") at 4\n(Docket Item 136). But regardless of whether York County changed its practice and the extent to which the\nlitigation caused York County to create the written policy, there is still value in requiring York County to maintain\nthe written policy so that the allegedly unconstitutional searches do not occur in the future. This requirement is\nthe equivalent of injunctive relief that the plaintiffs could recover following a successful liability determination at\n[1]\ntrial. See Second Am. Compl. at 8 (Docket Item 24) (requesting injunctive relief).  Viewed as a whole, the value\nof the settlement compares very favorably to the plaintiffs' likely recovery at trial.\n(B) Class Reaction\nThe reaction to the settlement by the approximately 7,500 class members has been favorable. Only one class\nmember filed written objections, another objected orally to the settlement at the final fairness hearing, and only\nfive class members opted out of the settlement. Because of the nature of this litigation, however, I do not consider\nthe relatively low number of objections and opt-outs to be significant. Class members may have been\nembarrassed to come forward and admit that they were arrested and strip searched. It is also unlikely that class\nmembers who felt uncomfortable identifying themselves as arrestees would opt out in order to litigate their claims\n\nindividually and publicly. The generally favorable response therefore is not a significant factor in settlement\napproval.\n(C) Stage of the Litigation\nTwo years of litigation and substantial discovery provided the parties information about the strengths and\nweaknesses of their positions on liability and damages before the settlement negotiations began. There were\nseveral rounds of interrogatories and document requests and both parties retained experts. The plaintiffs' lawyers\ncommunicated with over two hundred potential class members. Depositions of class members and correctional\nofficers highlighted factual disputes over whether the Jail officers afforded the arrestees privacy while they\nchanged over into the jail uniform, and whether the officers searched only the arrestees' clothes or whether they\n214 deliberately viewed the *214 arrestees' naked bodies during this changeover. Mot. for Final Approval at 8-9\n(detailing the discovery conducted by both parties). In response to a court order, York County provided the\nplaintiffs with information about its relevant insurance agreements during the class period. See Consent\nConfidentiality Order (Docket Item 96). The parties also had the benefit of the First Circuit's decision in Tardiff\naffirming class certification. Thus, this is a settlement based upon comprehensive information.\n(D) Quality of Counsel and Representation\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers were highly qualified and experienced. Both of the lead counsel have litigated a number of\ncivil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and one has litigated cases specifically alleging unconstitutional strip\nsearches (including some class actions). See Mot. for Final Approval, Ex. A, Decl. of Howard Friedman\n(\"Friedman Decl.\"), ¶¶ 6-7; id. Ex. P, Decl. of David G. Webbert ¶ 4. They diligently pursued discovery, as\ndemonstrated by their efforts to obtain electronic booking data from the Jail to help identify and contact potential\nclass members and the significant amount of discovery conducted prior to settlement. The lawyers were effective\nand thorough in their written and oral arguments and other communications with the Court. They advocated\nzealously and capably for the plaintiffs.\n(E) Conduct of Negotiations\nThe settlement negotiations were extensive and were conducted at arm's length, with no sign of collusion. York\nCounty was initially reluctant to engage in settlement discussions. Both parties remained far apart after two\nlengthy mediation sessions before a distinguished local mediator. They had to sort through complex issues\nregarding York County's insurance coverage before they could reach an agreement. See Harvey Decl. ¶¶ 3-4,\n7-9, 11-12. Both the mediator and York County's \"regular outside counsel\" report that the monetary award\nrepresents the maximum amount that the plaintiffs could have obtained in a settlement, and the outside counsel\nstates that York County would have abandoned settlement efforts if the plaintiffs had rejected the $3.3 million\noffer. See Harvey Decl. ¶ 15; Mot. for Final Approval, Ex. C, Decl. of Gene R. Libby, Esq., ¶¶ 10-11.\nI also note that the parties informed me at the final fairness hearing that there were no side agreements made in\nconnection with the proposed settlement. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(2) (requiring the parties to identify any such\nagreements).\n(F) The Risk, Complexity, Expense and Duration of Continued Litigation\nTo succeed at trial, the plaintiffs would have to overcome the significant factual dispute as to whether the York\nCounty corrections officers actually viewed the arrestees' naked bodies while they changed into the jail uniform.\nYork County would likely call a number of correctional officers to testify that they did not behave in that way, and\nseveral higher-ranking officers to testify about the Jail's training and formal policies. The plaintiffs would have\ncalled at least twenty-five class members to testify that the officers did view their naked bodies during the\nchangeover. The plaintiffs estimate that a total of fifty to seventy witnesses would testify at trial. A trial would be\nlengthy and expensive, and ultimately unsuccessful for the plaintiffs if the jury credited the testimony of\ncorrections officers over that of arrestees, always a serious risk in a trial of this sort.\n215 Following a liability determination, the plaintiffs would still have to recover damages. *215 At that point the\ndefendant could move to decertify the class on the issue of damages. See Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 7 (noting this\npossibility). Many plaintiffs likely would not pursue individual damage claims given the cost, the effort, and the\n\nneed to testify publicly about the fact that they were arrested and the harm that they experienced from the\nsearch. Moreover, even if the parties settled after a determination of liability, the costs of litigating the trial would\nhave reduced the available funds (because of insurance limits) for any post-trial settlement of the damage claims.\nHarvey Decl. ¶ 7.\nFinally, if the plaintiffs did succeed at trial, York County probably would appeal, adding more cost and delay. See\nMot. for Final Approval at 39-40; Def.'s Response at 5.\n(G) Allocation of the Settlement\n(1) Incentive Payments to Named Class Representatives and Deponents\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers propose incentive payments of $6,500 to Michele Nilsen, the first class representative;\n$5,500 to class representative Charles Neville; $5,000 to class representative Michael Goodrich; and $500 to\n[2]\neach class member who was deposed.  These proposed payments are fair, reasonable and adequate to\ncompensate the class representatives and deponents for their valuable efforts on behalf of the class.\nThe named class representatives sacrificed their privacy to vindicate the privacy rights of the class members.\nOther class members refused to act as class representatives because they wanted to protect their privacy and\ndid not want to reveal to the public that they had been arrested and strip searched. Friedman Decl. ¶ 15. This\nlawsuit would not have been filed but for class representative Michele Nilsen, who contacted one of the plaintiffs'\nlawyers when she read a newspaper article about a case involving similar strip searches that occurred in\nMassachusetts. Nilsen estimated that she spent over sixty hours on this case. She answered interrogatories and\nresponded to document requests. York County also deposed her, a process that took three hours and ten\nminutes (the longest of the class representatives). Her former boyfriend was also deposed. Nilsen stated that she\nfelt that her \"personal life was being examined under a microscope.\" Nilsen traveled from Massachusetts to\nattend the first mediation session. As the first named plaintiff, Nilsen was frequently mentioned in the press,\nalthough she chose not to speak with the media. Nilsen provided the Court with a copy of a newspaper article\nshe found online (conducting a Google search for her name) that contained inaccurate and embarrassing\ninformation about her. In the article, a York County official allegedly stated that he thought that Nilsen was\narrested for driving while intoxicated. Nilsen actually was arrested for driving with a suspended license. See Mot.\nfor Final Approval at 47-48; id. Ex. E, Aff. of Michele Nilsen.\nClass representative Charles Neville expended a significant amount of time and effort. He estimated that he\nspent thirty hours on this case. He responded to a set of interrogatories and a request for production of\n216 documents. York County also deposed him, an event that took one hour and forty-five minutes. Neville read and \n*216 commented on a draft of the settlement documents. Given the significant amount of publicity the case\nreceived in Maine, it is likely that people in Neville's community (Neville lives in York County) would recognize him\nas a class representative and therefore realize that he had been arrested and searched. He stated that friends,\nacquaintances, and business associates asked him about his participation in the case. Neville is self-employed\nand fears that the publicity will hurt his business. See id. at 48-49; id. Ex. F, Aff. of Charles Neville.\nLike Neville, class representative Michael Goodrich lives in York County and is likely to be recognized by people\nin his community as a class representative. He answered a set of interrogatories and responded to a request for\na production of documents. York County deposed him for one hour and fifteen minutes. He also believed that he\nwas retaliated against for his participation in this lawsuit. Specifically, he was incarcerated at York County Jail\nafter he agreed to act as a class representative. When he needed to be strip searched at the Jail during that time,\nhe believed that the correctional officers conducted a particularly thorough and embarrassing strip search due to\nhis participation in this case. See id. at 49-50; id. Ex. G, Aff. of Michael Goodrich.\nThe seventeen class members who were deposed deserve the $500 incentive payment to recognize the time and\neffort they expended in preparing for and attending the deposition. Their participation was valuable in advancing\ndiscovery in this case and helping both sides evaluate the merits of their respective positions. See id. at 50.\n(2) Lack of Individualized Recovery for Class Members\n\nI conclude that it is reasonable for the settlement to provide each class member with a modest uniform payment\nrather than individualized recovery based on the specific harm to each class member. Individualized recovery\nwould require a much more complicated claims process for the class members, involving a more detailed claim\nform and the possible submission of medical records, a hearing on damages and a psychiatric evaluation. This\nmore involved claims process might discourage class members from filing claims, particularly those class\nmembers who wish to maintain their privacy. See Friedman Decl. ¶ 15 (noting the importance of anonymity to\nclass members in strip search cases and the value of allowing them to recover for a violation of their privacy\nwithout giving up their privacy in the process). Evaluating the individual harm to each class member would also\nincur more administrative costs, potentially reducing the amount of money available for the class members, see\nHarvey Decl. ¶ 16, and could significantly delay payment.\n(3) Lack of Additional Payment for Multiple Searches\nThe proposed settlement provides only one payment to each class member regardless of the number of\nsearches the class member experienced. One class member objected orally at the preliminary hearing and\nsubmitted a written objection to this lack of additional payment for multiple searches. He argued that it is unfair\nnot to compensate class members for multiple searches because successive searches may be as, or more,\nhumiliating to the arrestee. Objection to Mot. for Final Approval at 1 (Docket Item 135).\nIt is true that the lack of compensation for multiple searches does fail to recognize that there may be at least\nsome additional harm from multiple searches. I also find this method of distribution troubling to the extent that it\n217 may reflect an unfair bias *217 against repeat arrestees.[3] But at a trial jurors might legitimately fail to\ncompensate significantly for additional searches on the premise that most of the harm resulted from the shock of\nthe first strip search, and that class members were harmed less by successive searches because they were\nmentally prepared for the later searches. See Bochnak Aff. ¶ 8 (noting that mock jurors believed that a person\nwho had been previously arrested and strip searched would know what to expect if arrested and searched again\nand would not be as bothered by the search). Charles Neville, a class representative searched twice during the\nclass period, confirmed this belief. He stated that although he was very upset by and remembered the details of\nthe first search, he felt more prepared for and could not remember the details of the second search. Mot. for Final\nApproval, Ex. F, Aff. of Charles Neville, ¶ 6.\nThis proposed uniform distribution is significantly easier and less costly to administer than a system that would\nrequire determining how many searches within the class definition each class member experienced. Thirty\npercent of the class members were booked multiple times within the class period. It is difficult to ascertain how\nmany of these bookings involved searches within the class definition because the Jail's records indicate only\nindirectly whether a booking involved the arrestee changing over into a jail uniform 00 just one criterion for\n97\nqualifying. Supplemental Consent Mem., Ex. H, Aff. of Myong J. Joun, ¶¶ 3-4 & Chart 1. The plaintiffs' lawyers\nspent three hours carefully reviewing the Jail records for the objector to determine how many of his bookings fit\nthe class definition. This review revealed that only one of the objector's five bookings during the class period\ninvolved a search that fit the class definition. See Decl. of Howard Friedman, Esq. (Docket Item 139). An appeal\nof the initial determination that a booking did not fit the class definition could also require much effort and\nexpense. If the settlement provided additional compensation for multiple searches, the plaintiffs' lawyers would\nneed to have someone spend a substantial amount of time and effort evaluating which bookings met the class\ndefinition. The plaintiffs' lawyers are currently agreeing to cap their administrative expenses, but these expenses\ncould increase significantly if they had to undertake this review for all of the class members who were booked\nmore than once during the class period. Pls.' Supplemental Mem. in Support of Mot. for Att'y's Fees and Litig.\nExpenses at 16, 17 n. 17 (Docket Item 134). Any increase in administrative expenses would reduce the recovery\nto the class members because the $3.3 million paid by York County covers all costs associated with this class\naction, including the payment to class members, attorney fees, and administrative expenses.\n218 So despite some concerns, I conclude that the failure to compensate for additional *218 searches is justifiable.[4]\nMy role is not to dictate the terms of settlement, but only to reject the settlement if it is not fair, reasonable and\nadequate. Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 726-27, 106 S.Ct. 1531, 89 L.Ed.2d 747 (1986) (\"Rule 23(e) wisely\nrequires court approval of the terms of any settlement of a class action, but the power to approve or reject a\n\nsettlement negotiated by the parties before trial does not authorize the court to require the parties to accept a\nsettlement to which they have not agreed\"); In re Warner Commc'n Sec. Litig., 798 F.2d 35, 37 (2d Cir.1986) (\"[I]t\nis not a district judge's job to dictate the terms of a class settlement; he should approve or disapprove a proposed\nagreement as it is placed before him and should not take it upon himself to modify its terms\"). I am ultimately\n[5]\npersuaded by the considerable administrative costs that compensation for multiple searches would require.  I\ndo not base this conclusion on endorsing any unfair bias that jurors might harbor toward the rights of repeat\narrestees. But I do consider that jurors legitimately may award less money for additional searches based on the\nbelief that later searches are less damaging. Uniform distribution does fail to recognize that class members who\nwere subjected to multiple searches may have experienced some additional harm from the later searches. But\ngiven the substantial administrative costs of compensating for that additional harm, I find that this distribution is\nreasonable.\n(4) Gender-Based Distribution Formula\nUnder the proposed settlement, each woman would receive twice as much as each man. One objector\nchallenged this double payment to women, claiming that it is unfair and unconstitutional. The plaintiffs' lawyers\nhave argued that the double payment to women is justified because women have a legally-recognized privacy\ninterest in their upper bodies. According to the plaintiffs' lawyers, this anatomical and legal difference between\nmen and women means that each woman experienced \"two legally recognized strip searches, one of [her]\nbreasts and one of [her] lower body.\" See Mot. for Final Approval at 37-38. In their brief, the plaintiffs' lawyers\ncontended that the fact that women experienced \"two ... searches\" also prolonged the experience, causing\nwomen more humiliation and emotional distress. Id. at 38. But at the final fairness hearing, the plaintiffs' lawyer\n219 relied only on the legal privacy distinction (two legal injuries) to support the payment *219 differential. He argued\nthat if the search policy had required the arrestees to remove only their shirts, then women would be able to\nrecover but men would not, and therefore that all women experienced two actionable searches regardless of the\nindividual harm to each woman. As further support for the double payment, the plaintiffs' lawyers have said that\njuries in strip search cases typically award more to females. See id. at 38-39 (citing Harvey Decl. ¶ 18).\nThe parties have cited only one case where a court has approved a strip search settlement in which the female\nclass members received double the amount paid to men. See id. at 38, citing Eddleman v. Jefferson County,\nKentucky, No. 3:91CV-144, at 6-7 (W.D. Ky May 21, 1999); see also Mot. for Final Approval, Ex. I, attachment 8.\nThere, the trial judge was initially concerned by the disparity, but ultimately approved the double payment to\nwomen, accepting the magistrate judge's reasoning that the disparity reflected the fact that juries typically award\nwomen more than men in strip search cases. Eddleman, No. 3:91CV-144-J, at 6; see also Eddleman v. Jefferson\nCounty, Kentucky, No. 3:91CV-144-J, at 27-28 (January 29, 1999) (Mot. for Final Approval, Ex. I, attachment 9)\n(decision by the magistrate judge recommending settlement approval) (noting that female litigants in strip search\ncases historically recover higher verdicts and citing some examples). In one other case, a settlement apparently\nwas approved where women received 1.5 times as much as men, but the court did not address the issue. See\nJoun Aff., ¶ 39 & attachment 15, citing Moser v. Anderson, No. C-93-634-B (D.N.H. Aug. 1999) (Joint Stipulation\n[6]\nof Settlement).  A larger number of courts, however, have approved settlements with no differential in the\n[7]\npayments to men and women.\nFor a judge to approve a local government paying twice as much to women as to men, constitutional standards\nmust be addressed. Under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a gender-based distinction\nby government can survive only if it is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental\nobjective. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996); Laro v. New\n220 Hampshire, 259 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2001). *220 Merely approximating the likely outcome of gender-based\ndifferences at trial is not an important governmental objective unless the plaintiffs provide a legitimate reason why\njuries in strip search cases award women more than they award men. Otherwise, replicating this disparity in jury\nverdicts may only perpetuate gender stereotypes if juries in strip search cases award more to women based on a\nstereotypical view that women are more fragile and need more protection than men. See, e.g., J.E.B. v. Alabama,\n511 U.S. 127, 138-41, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994) (noting that distinctions based on gender\nstereotypes reinforce prejudicial views of the relative abilities of men and women and violate the Equal Protection\nclause).\n\nDoes recognizing that in American culture women, but not men, have a privacy interest in their upper bodies\nqualify as an important governmental objective? If it does, the formula here 00 a double payment to women 00 is\n97 97\nnot substantially related to achieving that objective. The plaintiffs' lawyers have not shown how the legal violation\n[8]\nof women's privacy interests in their upper bodies justifies a double payment to women for the strip search.  At\nthe York County Jail, corrections officers performed only one search of the entire body, in which each arrestee,\nmale or female, had to remove all of his or her clothes and submit to a visual inspection. There were not two\nseparate searches of the upper and lower bodies of the arrestees. The plaintiffs' lawyers have failed to show that\nany increased humiliation or emotional distress for women resulting from the additional legal violation was twice\nas much as that experienced by men, thereby warranting double the recovery. Indeed, there is no empirical\nevidence at all about different emotional distress that men and women might suffer. Individuals obviously differ in\ntheir sensitivity to physical privacy intrusions, but it is an overbroad generalization to conclude that women suffer\ntwice as much emotional or legal injury as men do in a strip search. I conclude that the proposed gender-based\nallocation of this settlement does not meet constitutional standards because the differential is not substantially\nrelated to the achievement of an important government interest.\nObviously, I cannot approve as reasonable a settlement that does not pass constitutional muster. I therefore\ndisapprove the double payment to women under the proposed settlement.\nIV. OBJECTIONS\nI have already addressed some of the issues raised by the two objectors. I now address the remaining issues\nthey have raised. One objector challenged what he believed was the improper negotiation of the plaintiffs'\nattorneys fees prior to settlement. Mem. Regarding Fairness at 4-5 (Docket Item 140). But the plaintiffs' lawyers\nin this case did not negotiate their fees with the defendant prior to settlement. They negotiated for a common fund\nof $3.3 million, which includes payments to class members, attorney fees, costs, administrative expenses, and\nincentive payments to class representatives. They have filed a motion for attorney fees and expenses. Because I\nam disapproving the settlement over the gender-based differential, I do not yet address the attorney fees request.\n221 The sole objector at the final fairness hearing stated that she objected at first to *221 the amount of recovery (she\nthought that each class member would receive only a few hundred dollars based upon her premise that every\nclass member would participate in the distribution of funds), but seemed to withdraw this objection based upon\nwhat the lawyers described as the actual amount that each class member would receive under the proposed\nsettlement (about $2,800 to women; about $1,400 to men). In any event, for the reasons I have described, the\namount of the overall settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate. More important to this objector was her\neloquently expressed concern that the settlement did not include an admission of wrongdoing by York County. I\nrecognize the importance to the class members of an admission of wrongdoing and the symbolic importance it\nwould have. Nevertheless, I cannot dictate the terms of the settlement, only determine whether the settlement as\nproposed is fair, reasonable and equitable. I find that, given the other positive attributes of the settlement, the lack\nof such an admission does not make the settlement unreasonable, unfair or inadequate.\nV. CONCLUSION\nI DISAPPROVE the settlement but only to the extent that it provides for a gender-based allocation of the\n[9]\nsettlement proceeds.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] The settlement does not provide the declaratory relief that the plaintiffs requested in the lawsuit, a declaration\nthat the challenged practice is unconstitutional. See id. The defendant does not admit liability, and claims that it\ndid not employ the challenged practice.\n\n[2] The written objector objected to these incentive payments, then later withdrew his objection. Under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(4)(B), he needed court approval to withdraw his objection. I therefore address his\nobjection now, just as I would assess the fairness of the incentive payments in any event.\n[3] Part of the offered justification is that a jury would not award additional money for multiple searches because\njurors would believe that class members who had been arrested more than once are less deserving because of\nthe \"pattern of lawlessness.\" See Mot. for Final Approval at 34-37; Supplemental Consent Mem., Ex. G, Aff. of\nElizabeth Bochnak (\"Bochnak Aff.\") ¶ 9 (describing a study in which mock jurors stated that individuals who were\narrested and strip searched more than once were \"less deserving of damages than a person arrested only\nonce\"). At the final fairness hearing the plaintiffs' lawyer also stated that jurors may think that class members who\nexperienced multiple arrests and searches were \"causing the problem\" themselves, presumably by the conduct\nthat led to the arrest. Such justifications have little to do with the emotional injury actually suffered by class\nmembers.\n[4] I have read and considered the strip search cases cited by the plaintiffs' lawyers in which other courts have\napproved settlements that do not compensate for additional searches. See Joun Aff., ¶¶ 33-34, 39, 41 (citing\ncases) & attachments (opinions and orders from these cases); see also id. ¶ 35 (noting a case where the court\npreliminarily approved such a settlement). Although these cases indicate that other courts believe that the lack of\ncompensation for additional searches is not per se unreasonable, they are of only limited use. The cited cases\napproved uniform distribution without discussing it, and there are a number of other cases where courts have\napproved greater recovery for multiple searches, see id. ¶¶ 36-38 & attachments.\n[5] Capping recovery at a certain number of searches, perhaps three, would not save much time and effort. Most\nclass members with repeat bookings were booked only two or three times during the class period, so it still would\nbe necessary to review all these class members' bookings to determine how many qualified. It might also be\nnecessary to review a large number of the bookings for class members who were booked more than three times,\njust to find up to three qualifying searches. The plaintiffs' lawyers, for example, reviewed all five of the objector's\nbookings and found only one qualifying search.\n[6] The plaintiffs lawyers provided a Joint Stipulation with an attached distribution formula but state that the Court\nendorsed this formulation in its final settlement award. See Joun Aff., ¶ 39.\n[7] The plaintiffs' lawyers have listed several such cases in their affidavit. Joun Aff., ¶¶ 33-35, 37-38 &\nattachments 5-7, 10, 14 (citing strip search cases where courts approved 00 without discussion of the issue 00\n97 97\nsettlement awards that paid males and females equal amounts). See Maneely v. City of Newburgh, No. 01-\nCIV-2600 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2005) (Order for Preliminary Approval of Settlement) (Joun Aff., attachment 7)\n(preliminary approval of class action settlement with no differentiation made in payments to male and female\nclass members); Kahler v. County of Rensselaer, et. al., No. 03-cv-1324 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2004) (Final\nApproval Order) (Joun Aff., attachment 5) (final approval of proposed settlement award where men and women\nshared equally and without regard to the number of strip searches); Doan v. Watson, No. NA 99-4-C-B/S, 2002\nWL 31730917 (S.D.Ind. Dec.4, 2002) (Order Granting Final Approval of Class Action Settlement) (Joun Aff.,\nattachment 6) (same); Williams v. County of Los Angeles, et. al., No. CV 97-03826-CW (C.D.Cal. Dec. 6, 2002)\n(Order Re Settlement, Release and Dismissal of Claims in Class Action) (Joun Aff., attachment 10) (order\napproving settlement where men and women received the same award); Tyson v. City of New York, No. 97\nCiv.3762 (S.D.N.Y.Dec.2000) (Stipulation of Settlement) (Joun Aff., attachment 14) (stipulation of settlement\nwhere men and women received the same award).\n[8] Moreover, the parties have explicitly rejected the proposition that multiple searches should result in greater\nrecovery.\n[9] If the parties decide to amend the settlement to remove the cause for my disapproval, I would require a new\nopportunity for female class members who have filed claims to opt out. Because the class-wide settlement notice\nin this case already satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(e)(1)(B), as I discussed above, I would require notice of\nthe amendment and the opt-out right only to female class members who have already filed claims, because they\nare the only class members who would be negatively affected by such an amendment. Cf. In re Integra Realty\n\nRes., Inc., 262 F.3d 1089, 1111 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by\nfailing to notify class members of a new right to opt out because the right to opt out \"merely expanded the rights\nof class members\" and did not create \"a risk that unfavorable terms would be forced upon some class\nmembers\"); Manners v. Am. Gen. Life Ins. Co., No. Civ.A. X-XX-XXXX, 1999 WL 33581944, at *13 (M.D.Tenn.\nAug.11, 1999) (finding that notice of settlement amendments was unnecessary because the amendments\nenhanced the relief provided to the class members and the original notice satisfied constitutional standards); \nWhite v. Nat'l Football League, 836 F.Supp. 1458, 1468-69 (D.Minn.1993) (directing notice of amendments to the\nproposed settlement only to those class members affected by the amendments).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

INTRODUCTION\nThis is an award of attorney fees and expenses, out of a $3.3 million class action settlement for arrestee strip\nsearches at the York County Jail. Although I approved final settlement in my Orders of August 18 and September\n8, 2005, I reserved ruling on the motion for attorney fees. I conclude that the preferred method for determining a\nreasonable attorney fee is a market-mimicking analysis. Although the market data here is scant, it leads me to\naward 25% of the settlement, $825,000. Final expenses remain to be determined. But it appears that\n[1]\napproximately $2,400,000 (including interest of about $70,000)  will go to the class members.\nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n268 Individuals processed at York County Jail (\"Jail\") filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. *268 § 1983. They claimed that\nthe Jail violated the Fourth Amendment by maintaining a policy of \"strip searching\" arrestees without\nindividualized suspicion. After extensive discovery by the parties, I granted the plaintiffs' motion for class\ncertification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). Certification was appealed and affirmed. Tardiff v.\nKnox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2004). The parties then began discussions with a mediator. They subsequently\nfiled a notice of voluntary settlement.\nThe settlement agreement requires York County to establish a common fund of $3.3 million in satisfaction of all\nits liabilities (including attorney fees). The fund is to be distributed to class members after deduction of costs and\nfees. The agreement also provides that the plaintiffs' lawyers will ask the Court to award attorney fees out of the\nfund, in the amount of 30%, along with reimbursement for costs and expenses. Obviously the agreement does\nnot and cannot dictate what amount I will actually award.\nI held a preliminary hearing on the proposed settlement, and approved class-wide notice. Prior to the final\n[2]\nfairness hearing, the plaintiffs submitted a Motion for Attorney's Fees and Litigation Expenses.  After the final\n\nfairness hearing, I approved the settlement in all respects but one, and gave the parties the opportunity to\namend. At that time I reserved ruling on the request for attorney fees and expenses. The parties amended the\nsettlement to cure the offending term, and on September 8, 2005, I granted final approval of the settlement. The\nmotion for attorney fees, therefore, is now ripe for decision.\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers have asked me to award attorney fees, using the \"percentage-of-funds\" method, in the\n[3]\namount of 30% of the total settlement fund (irrespective of interest.)  As the settlement fund is worth $3.3\nmillion, they are asking for $990,000. (On the basis solely of hourly rates and hours spent, the lawyers estimated\nin June, 2005, that they would accrue somewhat less than $520,000 by the time everything is complete, although\n[4]\nthat estimate may now be higher, see Pls.' Rep. on Admin. of Settlement 5 (Docket Item 181).)  They also\nrequest reimbursement of litigation expenses and claims administration costs, in the amount of 3% of the total\nsettlement, i.e., $99,000. If awarded 30% in fees, they have agreed to limit cost and expense reimbursement to\nthis 3%, and propose to pay any additional expenses out of attorney fees.\n269  III. ANALYSIS\n*269\n[5]\nA. ATTORNEY FEES\nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in a class action I may award \"reasonable attorney fees and\nnontaxable costs authorized by law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(h). Had this lawsuit proceeded to a successful judgment for\nthe plaintiffs, they could have recovered from the defendant York County reasonable attorney fees and costs\nunder 42 U.S.0 § 1988, on top of any damages they received. Instead, York County settled the lawsuit before trial\nfor a lump sum of $3.3 million, covering all its liabilities, including attorney fees. Second Am. Settlement\nAgreement (\"Settlement Agreement\") ¶¶ 6-7 (Docket Item 168). That settlement amount reflects both the class\n[6]\nmembers' compensable injuries and their statutory claim to attorney fees.  Unless the lawyers who have\n[7]\nproduced the successful outcome are paid, the class members will be unjustly enriched. See Florin v.\nNationsbank of Ga. (Florin 1), 34 F.3d 560, 564 (7th Cir.1994) (\"[T]he settlement agreement seems to anticipate\nthat the amount paid by the defendants into the fund includes an unspecified sum for class counsel's fees....\"); \nBoeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U.S. 472, 478, 100 S.Ct. 745, 62 L.Ed.2d 676 (1980) (\"[P]ersons who obtain the\nbenefit of a lawsuit without contributing to its cost are unjustly enriched...\"); Restatement (Third) of Restitution\nand Unjust Enrichment § 30 cmt. b, at 75 (Tentative Draft No. 3, 2004) (when a fee-shifting case settles through\n[8]\ncreation of a common fund, \"[q]uestions of unjust enrichment may guide the court's inquiry\").  By the\nterminology of some of the caselaw, this settlement is a \"common fund,\" and the common fund doctrine allows\nme to award attorney fees from it. In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litig. (In re Compact\nDisc I), 216 F.R.D. 197, 216 n. 43 (D.Me.2003) (citing In re Thirteen Appeals Arising out of the San Juan Dupont\nPlaza Hotel Fire Litig., 56 F.3d 295, 307 (1st Cir.1995)); see also 4 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg\n[9]\non Class Actions § 14:6 (4th ed.2002).\n270 *270 Making a fair fee award from a common fund in a class action settlement is a difficult determination for a\njudge. There are no adversarial presentations to test the fee claim, and our legal system does not ordinarily\nexpect judges to behave as inquisitors, gathering testimony and collecting information on their own. Presented\nwith an unopposed request, therefore, I depend upon my own analysis and secondary research 00 against a\n97\nbackdrop of popular dissatisfaction with large and highly publicized fees. Third Circuit Task Force Report,\nSelection of Class Counsel, 208 F.R.D. 340, 343-44 (2002) (\"2002 Task Force Report\") (\"[T]here is a perception\namong a significant part of the non-lawyer population ... that class action plaintiffs' lawyers are overcompensated\nfor the work that they do.\"). But the lawyers here are highly skilled and experienced civil rights attorneys. Their\nprofessional performance was exemplary; they represented the class members' interests zealously, achieving an\nexcellent result for the class under the circumstances. For these reasons, they deserve a reasonable fee that\nduly recognizes their professional excellence and performance and provides an appropriate incentive for lawyers\n[10]\nto take on future meritorious cases on behalf of a client class.  At the same time, they do not deserve a\nwindfall at the expense of the class and I do not want the size of the award to encourage frivolous litigation that\nbenefits primarily lawyers.\n\n[11]\nIn candor, I simply do not know the precise fee award that meets those concerns.  I can only detail the\nprocess I have used.\n(1) Method: Lodestar or Percentage-of-Funds. In the First Circuit, courts have discretion to award fees from a\ncommon fund \"either on a percentage of the fund basis or by fashioning a lodestar.\" In re Thirteen Appeals, 56\nF.3d at 307 (approving allocation of fee award using percentage-of-funds method); United States v. 8.0 Acres of\n271 Land, 197 F.3d 24, 33 (1999).[12] As between the two methods, the *271 First Circuit has noted that the\npercentage-of-funds method is the prevailing practice, and that it may have distinct advantages over the lodestar\napproach. In re Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 307; see also 2002 Task Force Report, 208 F.R.D. at 422\n(suggested procedures for reviewing fee requests in non-auction cases); In re Compact Disc I, 216 F.R.D. at 215.\nAccording to the Third Circuit, the percentage-offunds method is preferred in common fund cases \"because it\nallows courts to award fees from the fund in a manner that rewards counsel for success and penalizes it for\nfailure.\" In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d 294, 300 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting In re Prudential Ins. Co. of\n[13]\nAmerica Sales Practices Litig., 148 F.3d 283, 333 (3d Cir.1998) )(internal quotation marks omitted).  I shall use\nthe percentage-of-funds method here 00 i.e., is the total fee reasonable when examined as a percentage of\n97\nrecovery?\n(2) The Limited Role of the Lodestar. As I have previously recognized, the \"lodestar approach (reasonable hours\nspent times reasonable hourly rates, subject to a multiplier or discount for special circumstances, plus reasonable\ndisbursements) can be a check or validation of the appropriateness of the percentage-of-funds fee, but is not\nrequired.\" In re Compact Disc I, 216 F.R.D. at 215-16; see also Vaughn R. Walker & Ben Horwich, The Ethical\nImperatives of a Lodestar Cross-Check: Judicial Misgivings About \"Reasonable Percentage\" Fees in Common\nFund Cases, 18 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 1453, 1468, 1470 (2005) (arguing that courts reviewing percentage fees\nhave ethical obligation to perform cross-check); but see 2002 Task Force Report, 208 F.R.D. at 422 (expressing\nskepticism of even this limited use of the lodestar; \"the lodestar is at most a relevant factor ... and it should not\nreceive exaggerated importance.\"). Here, the lodestar figure is lower than the requested percentage fee,\napproximately $520,000 vs. $990,000.\nWhen the lodestar cross-check shows that the percentage fee is lower than the fees the lawyers have accrued on\na timeand-services basis, it is relatively easy to support a percentage-based fee. See, e.g., In re Compact Disc I,\n216 F.R.D. at 217; In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litig. (In re Compact Disc II), 370\nF.Supp.2d 320, 323 (D.Me.2005). But what if the percentage fee is higher than the lodestar (as it is here), maybe\nsubstantially higher?\nUnder binding Supreme Court precedent, lodestar enhancements or multipliers in fee-shifting cases are almost\ncompletely unavailable, because many considerations that could lead to enhancement are contained within the\nlodestar itself. Penn. v. Del. Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546, 566, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 92 L.Ed.2d\n439 (1986) (\"[T]he lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a `reasonable'\nattorneys' fee.\"); see also, e.g., Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 898-99, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984)\n(case's \"novelty and complexity\" normally reflected in number of hours expended, and lawyers' \"experience and\nspecial skill\" normally reflected in hourly rate). Outright prohibitions also exist. Id. at 901, n. 16, 104 S.Ct. 1541\n272 (no enhancement for \"great number of persons benefited.\"); City of Burlington*272v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 567,\n112 S.Ct. 2638, 120 L.Ed.2d 449 (1992) (no enhancement for contingency or risk of litigation); but see Blum, 465\nU.S. at 901, 104 S.Ct. 1541 (enhancement may still be available in cases of \"exceptional success\"). The First\nCircuit is emphatic in rejecting multipliers to enhance the lodestar. See Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 942 (1st\nCir.1992) (enhancement for quality of representation is a tiny exception that may not \"eclipse the rule,\" and only\navailable \"where a combination of sterling performance and exceptional results could conceivably justify a\npremium fee\"); Adams v. Zimmerman, 73 F.3d 1164, 1178 (1st Cir.1996) (holding for second time post-Dague\nthat contingency enhancement unavailable). In fact, since Dague, the First Circuit has never awarded a lodestar\nenhancement or multiplier. The unenhanced lodestar figure is strongly presumed to be the reasonable attorney\nfee that the losing defendant should pay in a fee-shifting case.\n\nDo these constraints on multipliers apply when I am not making an award against a losing defendant, but instead\ndetermining the reasonable fee that the lawyers should recover from the plaintiff class's common fund\nsettlement? I conclude that they do not.\nFirst, it is well established that a defendant may settle, for a single lump sum, all outstanding claims in a fee-\nshifting case, including claims for attorney fees. Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 731-32, 106 S.Ct. 1531, 89\nL.Ed.2d 747 (1986) (Congress intended fee awards to be part of civil rights plaintiff's \"arsenal of remedies,\" and\nsettlement including waiver of award is consistent with this goal).\nSecond, it is equally well established for nonclass actions that the statutory amount that a defendant is required\nto pay under fee-shifting principles does not limit the amount that the plaintiff must pay the plaintiff's lawyer. \nVenegas, 495 U.S. at 90, 110 S.Ct. 1679 (fee-shifting statute \"controls what the losing defendant must pay, not\nwhat the prevailing plaintiff must pay his lawyer\"). The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed this principle in \nGisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U.S. 789, 122 S.Ct. 1817, 152 L.Ed.2d 996 (2002). There, it held that the plaintiff was\nbound to pay his lawyer the agreed-upon contingency fee of 25%, rather than the lower lodestar amount the\ndistrict court assessed against the defendant under a fee-shifting statute. Id. at 806, 122 S.Ct. 1817 (\"[W]e again\nemphasize... [that] the lodestar method was designed to govern imposition of fees on the losing party ....\n[N]othing prevents the attorney from gaining additional fees, pursuant to contract, from his own client.\"); accord \nGobert v. Williams, 323 F.3d 1099, 1100 (5th Cir.2003) (plaintiff's obligation to pay lawyer determined by retainer\nagreement, independent of fee award made by court).\nThese cases, read together, uncouple the fee analysis in determining an award against the losing defendant (the\nunenhanced lodestar) from the fee analysis for determining an award to the lawyer from the amount that he or\nshe has recovered. Although, unlike Gisbrecht, there may be no fee contract for the plaintiffs' lawyers in a typical\n273 class action,[14] I conclude that the *273 reasoning of these cases permits me to award a percentage attorney\nfee (so long as it is reasonable) from a common fund in a class action settlement even if the fee effectively\nrepresents a multiplier of the lodestar amount. Accord Florin I, 34 F.3d at 564-65 (the policy considerations\n[15]\nforbidding \"multiples in statutory fee-shifting cases have little force in common fund cases\").\n(3) The Reasonableness of the Requested Percentage. In a class action, any fee I award must be reasonable.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(h); see also Boeing Co., 444 U.S. at 478, 100 S.Ct. 745 (lawyer creating common fund benefiting\nnon-clients is entitled to \"reasonable attorney's fee\" from fund). Thus, I must determine whether the 30%\nrequested is reasonable under the circumstances, bearing in mind that my role takes on special importance\nbecause there are no adversaries here to dispute the fee and because I must act as a fiduciary of the class. See\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(h) advisory committee note (\"Active judicial involvement in measuring fee awards is singularly\nimportant to the proper operation of the class-action process ... [e]ven in the absence of objections.\"); In re Rite\nAid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d at 307 (when determining fees, judges \"must protect the class's interest by acting\nas a fiduciary\"). First Circuit cases give no guidance on how to determine whether a given percentage is\nreasonable. First, therefore, I canvass the approaches of other Circuits.\n(a) Other Circuit Approaches. The majority of Circuits review percentage-offunds fee awards by using multifactor\ntests in which the district court must examine and set forth findings on each factor. The Second Circuit requires\nanalysis of six factors. Goldberger v. Integrated Res., Inc., 209 F.3d 43, 50 (2d Cir.2000); see also Wal-Mart\n274 Stores, Inc., 396 F.3d at 121.[16]*274 The Sixth Circuit also uses six factors. Ramey v. Cincinnati Enquirer, Inc.,\n[17]\n508 F.2d 1188, 1196 (6th Cir.1974); see also Smillie v. Park Chem. Co., 710 F.2d 271, 275 (6th Cir.1983).\nThe Third Circuit, both in caselaw and through its influential Task Force, requires seven. Gunter v. Ridgewood\nEnergy Corp., 223 F.3d 190, 195 n. 1 (3d Cir.2000); 2002 Task Force Report, 208 F.R.D. at 423-24; see also In re\n[18]\nRite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d at 301.\n[19]\nOther circuits explicitly adopt the twelve factors  of a seminal lodestar case, Johnson v. Georgia Highway\nExpress, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974) (adopting factors as \"consistent with\" the Model Code of Profl\n[20]\nResponsibility).  For example, the Fourth and Tenth Circuits mandate \"pure\" Johnson factors for percentage-\nof-funds fee awards. In re MRRM, P.A., 404 F.3d 863, 867-68 (4th Cir.2005) (applying factors of Barber v.\n\nKimbrell's, Inc., 577 F.2d 216, 226 (4th Cir.1978) (adopting Johnson), to percentage award); Brown v. Phillips\nPetroleum Co., 838 F.2d 451, 454-55 (10th Cir.1988). The Eleventh Circuit also mandates the Johnson factors,\nbut adds still more factors, similar to those of the non-Johnson circuits. Camden I Condo. Ass'n v. Dunkle, 946\n[21]\nF.2d 768, 775 (11th Cir.1991).\n275 *275 It is easy to see that the multifactor tests largely overlap. Almost all include factors related to the lodestar\namount (time and labor), the complexity and difficulty of the case, the quality of the lawyers or the representation\n(including skill, standing, and efficiency), the size of the fund (including the value of the benefit to the class), and\nthe risk of nonpayment or contingency of the case. Additionally, both the Third Circuit and the three Johnson\n[22]\ncircuits add comparison to other awards in similar cases,  and the Third and Eleventh Circuits also look to\nwhether there are objections. These, then, comprise the bulk of the factors used in the multifactor jurisdictions.\n[23]\nThree other circuits do not mandate specific multifactor tests. Instead, the Ninth Circuit uses a benchmark of\n25%, from which deviation is permitted upon consideration of various case-specific factors. Vizcaino v. Microsoft\n[24]\nCorp., 290 F.3d at 1047-48.  The Eighth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit have not ruled on the\nappropriate way to review a percentage-of-funds fee award, and have not engaged in any extended discussion of\nreasonableness. But both those circuits have pointed to \"benchmark\" percentage ranges to justify the\nreasonableness of particular fees. Petrovic v. Amoco Oil Co., 200 F.3d 1140, 1157 (8th Cir.1999) (24% fee found\nreasonable by citing 1985 Task Force Report's proposition that fees in range of 20-25% are reasonable); \nDemocratic Cent. Comm. of D.C. v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm'n, 3 F.3d 1568, 1575 (D.C.Cir.1993) (fee\nfound reasonable in part because it \"falls well within the range usually awarded in common fund cases,\" 20% to\n30%); see also Camden I Condo. Assoc., 946 F.2d at 775 (finding that district courts increasingly view 25% as\n\"bench mark\").\nThe Seventh Circuit determines reasonableness through a market-mimicking approach with the goal of awarding\na fee that is the \"market price for legal services, in light of the risk of nonpayment and the normal rate of\ncompensation in the market\" at the outset of the case. In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig., 264 F.3d at 718. According to\nthe Seventh Circuit, reasonableness is not an ethical or philosophical question; \"it is not the function of judges in\n276 fee litigation to determine the equivalent *276 of the medieval just price. It is to determine what the lawyer would\nreceive if he were selling his services in the market rather than being paid by court order.\" In re Cont'l Ill. Sec.\nLitig., 962 F.2d 566, 568 (7th Cir.1992). This approach emulates the incentives of a private clientattorney\nrelationship; the market price should take into account \"the risk of nonpayment,\" \"quality of performance,\" \"the\n[25]\namount of work,\" and \"the stakes of the case.\" Id. at 721.  For the Seventh Circuit, the key inquiry is what a\nprivate plaintiff would have negotiated with the lawyers, if they had bargained at arm's length at the outset of the\ncase. Id. at 718.\nThe Seventh Circuit approach presents special concerns in the context of class actions, of course, for generally\n[26]\nno contract exists between lawyers and the class.  After all, attorney fees in a class action require court, not\n[27]\nclient, approval.  Thus, there is no readily apparent source of information about the market. See id. at 573.\nThat is the major criticism leveled at the Seventh Circuit approach: that for some fee-shifting class action claims,\nany \"market\" is simply illusory and speculative, Vizcaino, 290 F.3d at 1049-50, and that instead of any sort of\nprivately negotiated fee, for many noncommercial cases the fee is set entirely by judicial reference to what is\nreasonable. Id. at 1049 (the market is \"simply counsel's expectation of court-awarded fees\"); see also \nGoldberger, 209 F.3d at 51-52 (\"[M]arket rates, where available, are the ideal proxy for [lawyers'] compensation.\nThe problem is that we cannot know precisely what fees common fund plaintiffs in an efficient market for legal\nservices would agree to....\"). While the Seventh Circuit has recognized that this is a legitimate concern, it retorts\nthat a \"consider-everything,\" factor-based method of setting fees \"assures random and potentially perverse\nresults,\" and that a \"list of factors without a rule of decision is just a chopped salad.\" In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig.,\n264 F.3d at 719.\n(b) The Method I Shall Adopt in this Case. My decision on attorney fees is of great importance to the lawyers and\nclass members in this case. Every dollar I award the lawyers is a dollar that the class members will not recover\nand vice-versa. It also has great importance for future lawyers and plaintiff classes in this District, for in the\n\nabsence of First Circuit law, they deserve an intelligible and predictable standard. I hope that an ongoing\nexposure to attorney fee requests in these class actions has begun to inform my thinking. I shall try to explain\nfully the rationale for my award for guidance in future attorney fee cases.\nIn past awards from common funds, I have recognized the difficulty and arbitrariness of assessing the\nreasonableness of a given fee. In re Compact Disc I, 216 F.R.D. at 216 (\"Although some of the cases and\ncommentaries call upon district judges to give a precise analysis of how they choose the percentage, I do not\n277 know how *277 to do so in any meaningful way that would defend 10% over 11% or 9%, etc.\"). In none of those\ncases did I specify a methodology for determining reasonableness; rather, I referred more generally to finding the\nparticular percentages reasonable under the circumstances. In re Compact Disc II, 370 F.Supp.2d at 323; In re\nCompact Disc I, 216 F.R.D. at 216. In each of them, the fee I awarded was lower than the lodestar figure accrued\nby the lawyers at the time of settlement. See also Tr. Final Fairness Hr'g at 37, Ramirez v. DeCoster, No.\n2:98cv186 (D. Me. final approval of settlement Dec. 3, 2002) (Docket Item 264) (awarding attorney fee of onethird\nof recovery, lower than lodestar). Today, in the first case in which I have been asked to award a percentage that is\n[28]\nhigher than the lodestar, I shall identify a specific methodology.\nThe path of least resistance is to employ the multifactor approach to reasonableness. The majority of circuits use\nit and the fee-seeking lawyers have used it here. It will support virtually any percentage fee I award in a range\nfrom 16% to 33-1/3%.\n[29]\nBut the preceding statement is the first and primary reason I reject the multifactor approach.  It offers little\npredictability to either the awarding court, or the lawyers who seek fee awards. Report of the Third Circuit Task\nForce, Court Awarded Fees, 108 F.R.D. 237, 244-45 (1985) (\"1985 Task Force Report\") (noting criticism of factor-\nbased standard that it does not guarantee \"rational\" awards and that it encourages district courts to make\nconclusory awards subject to reversal and remand). In this case, for example, it would support equally a fee\naward of 16%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or 33-1/3%. That is not a rule of law or even a principle. Instead, it allows\nuncabined discretion to the feeawarding judge. A judge who likes lawyers and remembers the hazards of practice\ncan be generous; a judge who cares more about public reaction or who never used contingent fees in practice\n[30]\ncan be stingy.  It is difficult to contradict the judge's statement about the case's complexity or lack thereof, the\ndifficulties of discovery, the quality of the lawyering, etc. These are all highly subjective judgments.\nThe second reason I reject the multifactor approach is that some of the factors seem inconsistent with the reason\nfor using a percentage-of-funds method in the first place, which is designed to create incentives for the lawyer to\nget the most recovery for the class by the most efficient manner (and penalize the lawyer who fails to do so). See\n278 In re Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 307 (percentage-of-funds method *278 eliminates incentive to be inefficient, as\ninefficiency just reduces the lawyer's own recovery); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 396 F.3d at 121 (the percentage\nmethod \"directly aligns the interests of the class and its counsel\" and provides a powerful incentive for efficiency\nand early resolution) (citations omitted). Why, then, should we adjust the percentage depending upon whether the\nlawyer was efficient, how much time the lawyer put into the case, etc.?\nThe third reason I reject the factorbased approaches is that they consume significant lawyer and judicial\nresources, a consideration that has led to the criticism (and in some quarters, the abandonment) of the lodestar\nmethod in favor of the percentage-of-funds method. See In re Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 307 (stating lodestar\nmethod more \"burdensome to administer\" than percentage-of-funds method).\nI believe that in setting a fee, a judge, consciously or unconsciously, necessarily compares what lawyers typically\nget paid for equivalent services 00 i.e., the market price. The judge may do that based on recollections from when\n97\nthat judge was a lawyer, from information generated in other cases, or from general lawyer/judge gossip, but\ninevitably the judge takes such information into account. The Seventh Circuit appropriately makes this measure\nexplicit, rather than a Gestalt lurking behind the multifactor review. Making the standard explicit, in turn, allows\n[31]\nthe lawyers or objectors to provide evidence to correct judicial misimpressions.\nThere is good reason for using a market-oriented approach. If a consumer wanted to determine a reasonable\nplumber's, mechanic's or dentist's fee, the consumer would have to look to the market. Why should lawyers be\ndifferent? Perhaps more important, the market is the implicit if not explicit standard when a jury awards damages\n\nthat include reasonable medical expenses in a personal injury case. We do not use a multifactor approach then.\nWe even look at the market to a degree in lodestar cases, because we purport there to look at market rates for\nwhat a lawyer can charge as an hourly rate.\nI therefore adopt the methodology of the Seventh Circuit as most reflective of what a judge does instinctively in\nsetting a fee as well as most amenable to predictability and an objective external constraint on a judge's\notherwise uncabined power: \"courts must do their best to award counsel the market price for legal services, in\nlight of the risk of nonpayment and the normal rate of compensation in the market at the time.\" In re Synthroid\n279 Mktg. Litig., 264 F.3d at 718.[32] The market-mimicking *279 approach has its own shortcomings but it is better\n[33]\nthan the fuzzier alternatives.\nUnfortunately, in this case I do not have direct data on the market price for civil rights class action lawyers, or for\nstrip search class action cases inside or outside of Maine. To some degree, that is unavoidable for the reasons\nalready described: the class action \"market\" is controlled by judges. That is why this is a market \"mimicking\"\napproach. But there should be contextual market information available, such as what lawyers charge as\npercentage fees for various types of litigation. As I suggest later, I shall probably ask for such information in future\ncases. Moreover, because I have not used this method of testing reasonableness previously and because First\nCircuit caselaw is silent, in fairness I will re-open the question if the lawyers wish to present additional evidence\nand arguments addressing it. If they do so request, however, I shall also consider appointing a special master\nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 53, or an independent expert under Fed.R.Evid. 706, and also entertain the defendant's offer\nto reveal information about its attorney fee arrangements.\nIn the meantime, I look to such evidence as is available to suggest what hypothetical negotiation would have\nproduced at the outset as an agreed-to fee for a case such as this.\n(1) Standard Contingency Fees. First, I consider standard contingency fees and the limitations imposed upon\nthem by statutes or regulations. Although there is considerable variation by type of case and by stage of litigation,\none-third of the amount recovered is considered by most to be the general standard in personal injury litigation. 1\nRobert L. Rossi, Attorneys' Fees, § 2:9 (3d ed.2001). At least two of the named plaintiffs in this case did negotiate\ncontracts for a straight contingency fee of one-third of the recovery. Michele Nilsen signed the contract in\nSeptember, 2002, a month before the complaint was filed. At that time it appears that there was a general\ndiscussion regarding the possibility of filing the case as a class action. Nilsen Aff. ¶ 5. (The complaint was filed as\na putative class action on October 15, 2002.) Later, in May, 2003, Michael Goodrich signed a contract for the\nsame one-third contingency fee. Goodrich Aff. ¶ 2. Mr. Goodrich had learned about the case and believed that he\nwas a class member. Id. at ¶ 1. At the time that he agreed to the fee, Mr. Goodrich also explicitly agreed to serve\nas a class representative, and learned of his obligations in this role. Id. at ¶ 2. Obviously such agreements bind\nneither the class nor the court, but they are of modest limited evidentiary value on what the market might\nproduce. Nevertheless, the paramount question remains what the lawyer would hypothetically charge in a class\naction specifically. The class action provides for the possibility of a significantly larger recovery that, despite the\n280 inherent increased complexity, may induce the lawyer to take the case for a *280 lower percentage charge. Thus,\n[34]\nwhile this information is relevant, it does not compel a particular result.\nLooking to other facets of contingent fee practice, I observe that Maine statutes limit the contingency fee in\nmedical malpractice claims to what is ultimately a lower percentage. 24 M.R.S.A. § 2961(1) (2000) (in medical\nmalpractice actions, total contingent fee that may be contracted is 33.33% of first $100,000 of recovery, 25% of\nnext $100,000, and 20% of any amount over $200,000). For the amount recovered here, the blended fee would\nbe 20.6%. Maine also places declining limits on attorney fees in proceedings before the Workers Compensation\nBoard. 39-A M.R.S.A. § 325(4)(B) (2001) (if case tried to completion, fees may not exceed 30% of benefits\naccrued; for lump-sum settlements postexpenses, fees restricted to 10% of first $50,000, 9% through 6% of the\nnext increments of $10,000, and 5% of any amount over $90,000). For the award requested here, the blended\n[35]\nfee would be 5.1%. I am not aware of any other Maine caps on what a lawyer can charge a client.\nFor certain claims, Federal statutes also limit the amount that a lawyer may collect from a client. See generally \nGisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U.S. at 802-03, 122 S.Ct. 1817, 152 L.Ed.2d 996 (2002) (collecting representative\nstatutes). For example, courts may approve contingency fees to a maximum of only 25% of past due benefits\n\nawarded to a successful plaintiff in Social Security proceedings. 42 U.S.C. § 406(b) (2003). The Federal Tort\nClaims Act allows courts to approve contingency fees from the successful plaintiff's recovery to a maximum of\n25% if the fund is created through judgment, or 20% if through settlement. 28 U.S.C. § 2678; see also Veterans'\nBenefit Act, 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d)(1) (1994) (20% of past due benefit). Several other federal statutes are less\ngenerous and allow a maximum of only 10% of the recovery to go toward attorney fees. See, e.g., War Claims\n[36]\nAct, 50 U.S.C.App. § 2017m (1990) (10% of award).\nBoth the state and federal percentage caps are instructive, for they represent constraints on the fee a lawyer may\nrecover in certain legal arenas. Sometimes, the maximum allowable percentage then becomes the market norm\nin that arena, rather than merely the upper ceiling. See Gisbrecht, 535 U.S. at 800, 122 S.Ct. 1817 (contingent\n281 fee contracts for fees of 25%, maximum allowable percentage, are \"most *281 common fee arrangements\" for\nSocial Security claimants). At the same time, I recognize that there is no statutory cap for attorney fees in civil\nrights cases like this one.\n[37]\n(2) Awards in Other Cases. For other strip search class actions resulting in a common fund settlement,  the\nlowest percentage awarded as a fee that I have discovered was 16% ($1 million of a $6.25 million common fund).\nHaney v. Miami 00 Dade County, No. 04-20516-CIV (S.D. Fla. judgment of dismissal Oct. 7, 2005); see also\n97\nKahler v. County of Rensselaer, No. 03-cv-01324 (N.D.N.Y. final approval of settlement Sep. 23, 2004) (fee of\napproximately $443,000 from total potential fund of $2.7 million, representing about 16%, but with no explanation\nas to method, whether lodestar or percentage). The highest percentage explicitly awarded by a court was\n[38]\n33.33%, or $3,833,333 of an $11.5 million fund. Eddleman v. Jefferson County, No. 3:91CV-144 (W.D. Ky.\nfinal approval of settlement May. 5, 1999). Other cases seem to be distributed fairly evenly within that range.\nMedian attorney fee awards in other class actions generally (i.e., not limited to strip searches) range within a few\npercentage points on either side of 30%. Thus, a survey of 1,120 common fund class actions found that the\nmedian award of attorney fees and expenses was 31.6% of the fund for cases in which the class recovery ranged\nfrom $3 million to $5 million. Stuart J. Logan et al., Attorney Fee Awards in Common Fund Class Actions, 24\nClass Action Rep. 167, 167 (2003). According to a recent Federal Judicial Center study of 621 class actions, an\naward of 29% for attorney fees and expenses was \"typical.\" Thomas E. Willging & Shannon R. Wheatman, An\nEmpirical Examination of Attorneys' Choice of Forum in Class Action Litigation 52 (2005). An earlier Federal\nJudicial Center study found that median fee rates \"ranged from 27% to 30%.\" Thomas E. Willging et al., Empirical\n[39]\nStudy of Class Actions in Four Federal District Courts 69 (1996).\n(3) The Award Here. Maine practice is certainly relevant. This is a Maine lawsuit, with a Maine defendant, and\nmostly Maine plaintiffs. Therefore, to the extent I know them, I consider both the general range of contingent fee\nagreements and the limits that Maine has placed statutorily on contingent fee recovery for certain kinds of cases.\nI can glean here that the Maine legislature concluded that 20.6% is a reasonable fee for medical malpractice\ncases of this magnitude. It appears that lawyers continue to take such cases with that fee limitation. On the other\n282 hand, there is no limit for civil rights lawsuits like this one, *282 and therefore the lawyers are able to bargain for a\nhigher contingent fee in individual civil rights cases. It is hard to generalize which kind of lawsuit has the higher\n[40]\nrisk and the greater complexity.  Since the 20.6% fee limit stays the same regardless of how much the\nrecovery exceeds $200,000, the medical malpractice lawyer has the opportunity to generate a huge fee with a\nhuge award that may not be available in civil rights class actions like this one. Fees, of course, are ordinarily\nnegotiated at the outset of the litigation before the size of recovery is known. Thus, those factors suggest that the\nmarket fee hypothetically negotiated for a civil rights class action might be somewhat higher than the 20.6%\neffective rate for medical malpractice cases of this size.\nThe workers compensation limits are unduly low for a civil rights class action. Workers compensation is largely an\nadministrative proceeding, generally without complex factual issues, extensive discovery, or difficult arguments\nsuch as class certification, liability is strict, and the legislature has tried to reduce lawyer involvement. The\nmedical malpractice numbers are more instructive and persuasive; like class actions, that cause of action\nincludes complex factual and legal issues, as well as substantial barriers to recovery. Therefore, I put little weight\non the workers compensation fee limits.\n\nThe Federal numbers are somewhat relevant. This was primarily a federal cause of action with a statutory fee\naward available at a successful conclusion. However, the federal limits from other statutes may be too restrictive,\nfor many of the claims at stake under those statutes are administrative and straightforward. Those limits may also\nreflect a legislative desire that attorney fees not diminish certain statutory entitlements. Therefore, I conclude that\nthe higher end of the federal 10%-25% range is more relevant than the lower end. I also recognize as I did before\nthat without a federal statutory cap for this type of case, the lawyers hypothetically are able to negotiate for a\nhigher percentage. A primary difficulty with all these numbers is that lawyers customarily practice in one of these\nfields or another, not across fields. Thus, the numbers have limited relevance.\nI also consider that two of the named plaintiffs agreed to one-third contingency fees, and that a one-third\ncontingency fee agreement is widely recognized in personal injury litigation. I draw no firm conclusions from that\ndata, because the two individual contracts were signed before class status existed, and the individuals,\ncontemplating their own individual recovery, had little incentive to bargain for a lower fee that might be available\nin a class action. I have already explained why the general contingency fee agreement is of limited help for the\npeculiarities of class actions, supra, note 34.\n283 Other judicial fee awards are relevant to some extent.[41] Other courts' awards neccessarily *283 affect the\nexpectations of lawyers and, therefore, what they might agree to in voluntary negotiation. See Vizcaino, 290 F.3d\nat 1050 (lawyers' reasonable expectations may be based on \"range of fee awards out of common funds of\ncomparable size\"). What they show here is that lawyers continue to take such cases in the face of fee awards\nranging from 16% to 33-1/3%. Human nature suggests, therefore, that lawyers taking such a case might hope for\n33-1/3% but recognize that it might be as low as 16%.\nThe above analysis leads me to an attorney fee award here of 25% ($825,000). This percentage is at the higher\nend of the federal statutory limitation range, somewhat above the effective Maine malpractice limit, much higher\nthan the Maine workers compensation percentage, lower than the standard one-third contingent fee and lower\nthan the two fee agreements entered into before this became a class action. The percentage is in the midrange\nof court awards in strip search cases, and it is more than 6% lower than the average award in general class\nactions with recoveries of this size, as reported by Logan, et al., supra, at 167.\nI am not confident that 25% truly is a good approximation of the market-mimicking rate. I could be wrong in either\ndirection. On the information I have, I just don't know. Ironically, therefore, on this record my use of the Seventh\n[42]\nCircuit's market-mimicking analysis may not be much better than the multifactor approach.  But I hope that it\nwill generate better evidence of the attorney fee market in future cases and more rational and predictable awards.\nMy reduction from the lawyers' requested 30% is no reflection whatsoever upon the quality of representation, or\nthe nature of this litigation; these lawyers were excellent. Further, it is not a criticism of the percentage that they\nrequested, given the precedents that they cite from other jurisdictions.\nIn future class actions that involve court-awarded attorney fees from a common fund, I will expect to receive\nevidentiary materials bearing on what lawyers negotiate for contingent fees or otherwise in comparable cases. I\nmay well request detail about the percentages that would apply at different settlement stages of the case. See In\nre Continental Illinois Sec. Litig., 962 F.2d at 569 (\"[R]isk of loss varies over the life of a case.\"). I may also\nconsider using my authority under Fed. R.Evid. 706 to appoint an expert to advise me on the attorney fee market.\nManual for Complex Litigation, supra, § 14.231, n.590 (recognizing courts' use of court-appointed experts to\nassist with attorney fee determinations). Finally, I may at least consider ordering lawyers to propose fee\n[43]\narrangements at the outset.\n284 *284 B. LITIGATION COSTS AND CLAIMS ADMINITRATION EXPENSES\nIn class action litigation, a district court may award reasonable costs. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(h); see also In re Fidelity/\nMicron Sec. Litig., 167 F.3d 735, 737 (1st Cir.1999) (prior to adoption of Rule 23(h), holding that class counsel\ncreating a common fund is entitled to recover \"expenses, reasonable in amount, that were necessary to bring the\naction to a climax\"). Here, the lawyers requested 3% of the $3.3 million fund for litigation costs and claims\nadministration expenses, and agreed to cap this request and pay the remainder from their own fee award if I\n\nawarded them the full 30% in fees. Mem. 16. Because I have not awarded the requested 30%, I direct the\nlawyers to promptly file with the court documentation of accrued and projected litigation costs and claims\nadministration expenses, which I will then review.\nC. LATE CLAIMS\nThe period for submitting a claim form to the Administrator or an extension request to the Court expired on\nSeptember 9, 2005. Settlement Agreement ¶ 31. Since that time, several individuals have written letters to the\nCourt requesting an extension of the time in which to submit a claim. At the request of the plaintiffs' lawyers, I\nhave extended that deadline to November 10, 2005. Order on Pending Requests by Class Members for\nExtension to File Settlement Claims 1 (Docket Item 182). I will await the claims administrator's decision on these\nclaims and entertain all appeals at one time.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nI award 25% of the settlement in attorney fees, specifically $825,000. I also direct the lawyers to file with the\nCourt prompt documentation of costs and expenses.\nSO ORDERED.\nAPPENDIX I\nHere, for what it is worth, is the multifactor reasonableness analysis, drawn from the factors common to all\nCircuits that use this method.\n1. The size of the fund created and the number of persons benefited. The common fund created by the\nsettlement agreement totals $3.3 million, plus interest now approaching $70,000. It will be distributed in its\nentirety after payment of fees, costs, claims administration expenses, and incentive payments. Although not part\nof the common fund created, there is additional value in the requirement that York County maintain a written\npolicy prohibiting challenged strip searches, value akin to that of injunctive relief, which will benefit future\narrestees. Order on Mot. for Final Approval of Class Settlement (\"Order\") 11 (Docket Item 159).\nThere are approximately 7,500 class members. From claims filed it appears that with a participation rate of\napproximately 17.78%, over 1,300 persons will directly benefit from this common fund. Decl. of Myong J. Joun 1\n(Docket Item 143). The participation rate is particularly noteworthy as it was revised upward from an earlier\nestimate of 12-13% during the class notice period, indicating that even more people will benefit than had\npreviously been thought. Order 7-8.\n2. The presence or absence of substantial objections. I have previously addressed the issue of objectors to the\n285 settlement. Due to the nature of this lawsuit and its potential for embarrassment in *285 publicly stepping forward,\n[44]\nI do not consider the relative absence of objections to settlement a significant factor. Order 11.\n3. The lawyers' skill and efficiency and the quality of representation. I have previously noted the skill of class\ncounsel in this case, and there is no need to recite this aspect again. See Order 12-13 (lawyers were \"highly\nqualified and experienced,\" \"effective and thorough,\" and \"advocated zealously and capably for the plaintiffs\"). I\ndo take additional note of class counsel's \"considerable and highly successful effort\" to reach as many class\nmembers as possible during the notice period. Id. at 7. This effort resulted in an upwardly revised participation\nrate estimate, which in turn contributed directly to the number of people benefited by this common fund.\n4. The complexity and duration of the litigation. This litigation lasted two years and occasioned extensive\ndiscovery. Order 12. There were significant factual disputes as to whether the corrections officers actually viewed\nthe arrestees' naked bodies while they changed into Jail clothing. Id. at 14. There was additional complexity due\nto the individualized nature of the alleged dignitary harm, which could have made the damages stage of the case\nprocedurally complicated if the defendant moved to decertify the class on the this issue. Id. Further, class\ncertification was not guaranteed, and was in fact vigorously disputed by York County all the way through appeal. \n\nSee Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d at 3. Finally, the parties had to sort through \"complex issues regarding York\nCounty's insurance coverage\" before reaching an agreement. Order 13.\n5. Contingency and risk of nonpayment. Class counsel in this case faced a substantial risk of nonpayment. The\nJail contested liability factually from the outset, and there was a \"serious risk\" that a jury would credit the\ncorrections officers' testimony over that of the arrestees. Order 14. Even if liability were established, it would still\nhave been difficult for the plaintiffs to prove and recover damages for harms that were often dignitary rather than\npecuniary. Id. at 9; see also Mot. For Final Approval, Ex. B, Decl. of Charles Harvey, Esq., ¶ 10 (Docket Item 133)\n(noting his belief that class members may receive nothing or only very small or nominal damage awards from a\njury; recovered fees would therefore be correspondingly less). York County was reluctant to engage in settlement\ndiscussions, and even after two lengthy mediation sessions, the two parties remained far apart. Order 13. Finally,\nthe risk of nonpayment was increased substantially by the fact that the settlement was funded largely by\ninsurance, and the amount available to fund it was finite and declined as York County spent more on defense\ncosts. Id. at 10.\n6. The amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs' counsel. There is no doubt that class counsel devoted a\nlong period of time to this litigation. The lodestar figure (the product of reasonable hours worked times the\nreasonable hourly rate) shows that in June, 2005, class counsel estimated that it would spend in total an amount\nsomewhat less than $520,000.00 worth of time on this case, at least 4,084 hours, over 2 years. Mem. 11-13.\n286 *2867. The awards in similar cases. In the main body of this Order, I have compared at length the percentage\nawards in other cases. Suffice it to say that the cases that are most similar (strip search common fund\nsettlements) range from 16% to 33%. See Appendix II.\nI can assess the lodestar cross-check similarly. The 25% awarded here represents a lodestar multiplier of\napproximately 1.6. Of the analogous strip search class action cases I reviewed for which lodestar data was\n[45]\navailable, I found a multiplier range from 1.19 to 2.68. See Appendix II. For class actions generally, in 142\ncases with a class recovery ranging from $3 million to $5 million the median multiplier was 1.89. Stuart J. Logan\net al., supra, at 167. But these averages and medians are of limited utility because the multiplier appears to differ\ngreatly from case to case, based on the size of the fund and the type of class action. See id. at 167, 196; see\nalso 4 Conte & Newberg, supra, § 14:6 (numbers \"ranging from one to four are frequently awarded\"); Walker &\nHorwich, supra, at 1468 (initial hypothesis that courts would award reasonable fees with multipliers ranging from\n1.5 to 2.5, but actual empirical research showed ranges between 1.0 to 5.0).\nThe 1.6 multiplier in this case is lower than all but one of the strip search cases, and lower than the average\nmultiplier of 1.89 found in class actions generally, and thus it is not unreasonable.\nI conclude that under a multifactor approach to determining the reasonableness of a percentage fee, the\npreceding factors fully support an award of 25% from a common fund of $3.3 million, as well as many other\npercentages.\nAPPENDIX II\nThe following are settlements of strip search cases either revealed by independent electronic research using\nWestlaw, Lexis, Google, and the PACER system, or advanced by the plaintiffs' lawyers in this case:\n1. Haney v. Miami-Dade County, No. 04-20516-CIV (S.D. Fla. judgment of dismissal Oct. 7, 2005).\nThe fee in this case was awarded after a little more than a year and a half of litigation including discovery, a\npreliminary fairness hearing, class notice, and the court's final approval of the settlement. The district judge\napproved the lawyers' requested 16% award ($1 million) from the common fund settlement of $6.25 million. The\nlodestar was reported as $535,000, resulting in a multiplier of 1.74.\n2. Bynum v. District Columbia, 384 F.Supp.2d 342, 352 (D.D.C.2005) (D.D.C. preliminary approval of settlement\nAug. 31, 2005).\n\nI draw no conclusions from this case because the proposed settlement merely went out for review by the class on\nAugust 31, 2005, after more than two years of litigation including discovery and class certification. In the\nsettlement, class counsel seeks 33% ($4.0 million) from the proposed common fund of $12 million. In the fee\npetition, the lawyers give the total projected lodestar as $2,099,420, resulting in a lodestar multiplier of 1.91.\n287 *287 3. Kahler v. County of Rensselaer, No. 03-cv-01324 (N.D.N.Y. final approval of settlement Sep. 23, 2004).\nThis case consolidated two actions, and settled after less than a year including class certification and preliminary\napproval. The settlement agreement created a common fund in an amount contingent upon the number of claims\nsubmitted, not to exceed a total obligation upon the defendant of $2.7 million. The defendant was to deposit\n$1,000 for every timely claim, as well as fees and costs determined by the court. The claims administrator\ndeclared that 835 timely claims were submitted.\nThe lawyers requested 20% ($580,000) of the defendant's maximum obligation of $2.7 million. The court reduced\nthe amount to $442,702 (without a written reason), which represented 16.4% of the total potential liability that the\ndefendant could have incurred.\nBut because of a reversion of unclaimed amounts, the total fund was ultimately much lower, approximately\n$1,282,702 ($835,000 for claimants plus $442,702 for the fees). The lawyers therefore received approximately\n34.5% of the fund. The court may not have considered this outcome when it made the fee award.\nThe lodestar was reported as approximately $371,396, resulting in a multiplier of 1.19.\n4. Connor v. Plymouth County, No. 00-10835-RBC (D. Mass. final approval of settlement Mar. 11, 2004).\nAfter almost four years of litigation including discovery, class certification, denial of a decertification motion,\npreliminary approval, and class notice, this case was settled by the creation of a $1.35 million fund. The court\nawarded the lawyers' requested 31% ($418,500) in fees. The lodestar in this case was approximately $155,813,\nresulting in a multiplier of 2.68.\n5. Williams v. Block, No. 97-03826-CW (C.D. Ca. final approval of settlement Nov. 27, 2002).\nThis case consolidated more than a dozen actions, and settled creating a common fund of $21.5 million, after\nmore than five years of litigation including discovery, numerous interlocutory appeals by both parties, denial of\nclass certification several times, and several motions to dismiss. The court awarded 20% (64,184,000) of the\nfund, although the lawyers had requested a fee of 25%.\n[46]\nThe lodestar was $4,260,643, resulting in a multiplier of 0.98.\n6. Mack v. Suffolk County, No. 98-12511-NG (D. Mass. final approval of settlement Oct. 1, 2002).\nThis case settled after more than five years of litigation including discovery, class notice, preliminary approval,\nand summary judgment including a judicial determination of full liability. Settlement (at which the only remaining\nissue was damages) created a common fund of $10 million. The court awarded fees in the amount of the\nrequested 30%, or $3.0 million. The lodestar was estimated to be approximately $645,635, resulting in a\nmultiplier of 4.65.\n288 *288 7. Doan v. Watson, 2002 WL 31730917 (S.D.Ind.2002) (No. 99-4-C-B/S).\nThe settlement agreement in this case created a common fund in a contingent amount equal to $1,000 for each\nclass member. The fund was exclusive of attorney fees. It appears that there were approximately 2,600 class\nmembers; thus the total amount contributed by the defendant to the fund was apparently $2.6 million. However,\nonly about 630 actual claims appeared to be filed at the cutoff date. (It is unclear what happened with the fund's\nremaining $1.97 million.)\nThe court approved fees and expenses to be paid by defendant in addition to the settlement fund, in the amount\nof $700,000, at a time when the judge expected the fund to be $2.7 million. That would represent a 21% fee of\nthe defendant's total potential liability.\n\nIf actual payout by the defendant was 1.33 million ($630,000 for the claimants plus $700,000 for the attorneys),\nthen attorney fees represented over 50% of that total.\nHowever, because the defendants paid the attorneys separately and in addition to the claimants, and the court\ndid not evaluate the fees in relation to the settlement fund, it is difficult to determine where this case fits.\n8. Gary v. Sheahan, No. 96-C-7294 (N.D.Ill.1998).\nAt first glance this case appeared to be governed by common fund principles. The court awarded fees after five\nyears of protracted litigation and summary judgment for the class on the merits. The parties subsequently settled\nthe damages, creating a fund of $6,882,500, exclusive of attorney fees.\nThe court then held a separate proceeding to determine the fees that the defendant would have to pay, above\nand beyond the fund amount. The court awarded $3.0 million to class counsel (without a written explanation as to\nthe basis for this amount).\nThus, this was not a common fund case (although there is confusing contrary language in the order).\n9. Moser v. Anderson, No. C-93-634-B (D.N.H. final settlement approval Jan. 13, 2000).\nThe lawyers here assert that in this case the judge awarded 33.3% of a $3.0 million settlement in attorney fees.\nJoun Aff. ¶ 39. However, the Joint Stipulation of Settlement attached as Exhibit 15 to the Memorandum does not\ncontain this information.\n10. Maneely v. City of Newburgh, No. 01-CV-02600, 256 F.Supp.2d 204 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (S.D.N.Y. stipulation of\ndiscontinuance and dismissal entered Sep. 6, 2005).\nThe lawyers here assert that this case is relevant to my fee award, and filed the Order for Preliminary Approval of\nSettlement in the case. It appears from this document that the case settled after more than four years of\ndiscovery, class certification, and preliminary approval, with the funding by the defendant of a settlement fund of\n$1.2 million, exclusive of attorney fees. Each eligible member (not a named plaintiff) is to receive $1,000 from this\nfund, and the rest will revert to the defendant. There is no information available for the number of claims\nprocessed.\nThe court awarded $550,000 in attorney fees, to be paid directly by the defendant (without a written explanation\n289 as to the basis for the award). Information about the amount requested by the lawyers is *289 unavailable. The\nfee award represents 31.4% of the defendant's total potential liability, but the reversion of unclaimed amounts\nmay make the ultimate percentage much higher.\nThe fee award does not appear to be governed by common fund principles, and thus I find it of little assistance.\n12. Eddleman v. Jefferson County, No. 3:91CV-144-J (W.D. Ky. final approval of settlement May 24, 1999).\nThis case was a consolidated action of numerous cases. After nearly eight years including class certification,\ndiscovery, interlocutory appeals, summary judgment motions, it settled with a common fund of $11.5 million. This\nwas to be the defendant's total potential liability, and any unclaimed money would revert to the defendant. At the\ntime of final approval, the court awarded attorney fees in the amount of 33.33% (equaling approximately\n$3,833,333) of the total fund. Because of the reversion of unclaimed funds to the defendant, the actual\npercentage awarded as a fee may have been higher.\n[1] Total costs and expenses were projected to be $102,336 in June, 2005., Mem. 17; Mem., Ex. 0, Decl. of David\nG. Webbert (\"Webbert Decl.\"). The lawyers now estimate that this figure is likely to increase to at least $142,000.\nPls.' Rep. on Admin. of Settlement 5 (Docket Item 181).\n[2] In support of their Motion (Docket Item 124), the plaintiffs filed both a Memorandum in Support on March 30,\n2005 (Docket Item 124), arid a Supplemental Memorandum in Support on June 15, 2005 (Docket Item 134).\nAccording to the plaintiffs, the Supplemental Memorandum \"is comprehensive and replaces the less inclusive\"\n\nearlier memorandum. Pls.' Supplemental Mem. Supp. Att'ys Fees & Litig. Expenses (\"Mem.\") 1 n.1 (Docket Item\n134). Thus, any reference in this Order to the \"Motion\" or \"Memorandum\" refers to only the Supplemental\nMemorandum\n[3] Class counsel has explicitly declined to request a percentage of the interest earned, Mem. 9.\n[4] In the Memorandum, there appears to be a mathematical error. The lawyers state that the lodestar amount as\nof the filing date in June, 2005 was \"more than $491,500.\" Mem. 10. However, adding together the numbers\nprovided to arrive at this figure, Mem. 12-13, I arrive at the lesser figure of $485,068.50. The apparent error does\nnot affect my decision. The lawyers also estimate that additional work on the case will add $28,000 to the current\nlodestar, id. at 11, 13, which would make a total of $513,068.50.\n[5] Because of the date that this lawsuit commenced, provisions of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 28\nU.S.C.A. §§ 1711-15 (West Supp. 1 2005), do not apply.\n[6] Commentators have recognized that the threat of fee-shifting may increase the size of the fund at settlement. \nSee Stephen J. Safranek, Curbing the Fees of the Class Action Lawyers in Light of City of Burlington, 41 Wayne\nL.Rev. 1301, 1305-06 (1994-1995) (\"The fund [at settlement] is so sizeable only because of the threat of statutory\nattorney fees.\").\n[7]See Charles Silver, A Restitutionary Theory of Attorneys' Fees in Class Actions, 76 Cornell L.Rev. 656, 665\n(1991) (\"[C]lass members have a duty to compensate attorneys who litigate class actions for them because,\nunder the circumstances, it is just and practicable to require them to pay.\"). Because the plaintiffs, not the\nlawyers, are entitled to the entire fund, a lawyer who wishes to be paid must therefore invoke a restitution claim.\n[8] Although the plaintiff class has the right to recover legal fees from the defendant under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 if the\nlawsuit is successful, Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U.S. 82, 87-88, 110 S.Ct. 1679, 109 L.Ed.2d 74 (1990), it is the\nlawyers who have the right to seek a fee payment from the resulting common fund. Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v.\nAm. Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 487 F.2d 161, 165 (3d Cir.1973) (a lawyer who has conferred a benefit\non a class has a \"cause of action for award of attorneys' fees under the [common] fund doctrine\"); Cent. R.R. &\nBanking Co. v. Pettus, 113 U.S. 116, 127, 5 S.Ct. 387, 28 L.Ed. 915 (1885).\n[9] It is not the classic common fund because the lawyers' interests are not parallel to the rest of the fund. It\nwould be a classic common fund if some plaintiffs first paid their lawyers, then sought recompense from the fund. \nSee Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 30 cmt. b, at 74-75 (Tentative Draft No. 3, 2004)\n(\"The classic common fund ... consists of assets that flow exclusively to beneficiaries similarly situated, from\nwhom the claimant seeks contribution on a theory of unjust enrichment.\").\n[10] \"[T]he court must also be careful to sustain the incentive for attorneys to continue to represent such clients\non an `inescapably contingent' basis.\" Florin v. Nationsbank of Ga. (Florin II), 60 F.3d 1245, 1247 (7th Cir.1995).\n[11] As the First Circuit has observed, \"[t]he difficulty for both fee-setting and fee-reviewing courts, in a field so\nsusceptible to arbitrariness, is the achievement of decisionmaking that is fair to the parties and understandable to\nthe community at large yet not unnecessarily burdensome to the courts themselves.\" Weinberger v. Great N.\nNekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 526 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945, 950 (1st\nCir.1984)).\n[12] If this case had proceeded to judgment, I would be bound to use the lodestar in determining any fee award\nagainst the defendant York County, as it is the strongly preferred method in fee-shifting cases, and a \"court shuns\nthis tried-and-true approach at its peril.\" Coutin v. Young & Rubicam Puerto Rico, Inc., 124 F.3d 331, 337 (1st\nCir.1997); see also Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir.1992) (citing Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424,\n433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)). The Circuits generally have concluded that common fund principles\ngovern, however, where a fee shifting case settles before judgment. See Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938,\n967-68 (9th Cir.2003); Brytus v. Spang & Co., 203 F.3d 238, 246-47 (3d Cir.2000); Florin v. Nationsbank, 34 F.3d\n560, 564 (7th Cir.1994); Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., 907 F.2d 1295, 1327 (2d Cir.1990); see also Alan\nHirsch & Diane Sheehey, Fed. Judicial Ctr., Awarding Attorneys' Fees and Managing Fee Litigation 69, 75 (2005)\n(stating that \"a common fund award is not necessarily precluded in such a case,\" and \"[n]o courts have held to\n\nthe contrary\"). I explain later why it is necessary to distinguish between an award against a defendant pursuant to\na fee-shifting statute, and the amount the plaintiffs' lawyers can recover from their client(s).\n[13] Although it is preferred, it is by no means perfect at aligning the interests of the lawyers and the class. See\nauthorities cited in In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig., 264 F.3d 712, 719 (7th Cir.2001).\n[14] There can be a contract between individually named plaintiffs and a lawyer in a class action. See, e.g., Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 123 (2d Cir.2005); Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., 290 F.3d 1043,\n1049 (9th Cir.2002). If that is the case, that individual may have a pro rata restitution claim against the other class\nmembers who have shared in the benefit of the common fund without paying a lawyer. See Restatement (Third)\nof Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 30 cmt. a, at 67 (Tentative Draft No. 3, 2004) (IA] person who has incurred\nlegal expenses ... to preserve or create a `fund' in which others are interested may require the others 00 in the\n97\nabsence of a contract 00 to contribute ratably to the cost of securing the common benefit.\"). But reasonableness\n97\nwill still limit the reimbursement. Id. at 75. At least two of the named plaintiffs in this case did sign contracts with\none of the law firms, agreeing to a contingency fee of one-third of the recovery. Mem., Ex. A, Decl. of Howard\nFriedman (\"Friedman Decl.\"), ¶ 18; Ex. E, Aff. of Michele Nilsen (\"Nilsen Aff.\"), ¶ 5; Ex. G, Aff. of Michael\nGoodrich (\"Goodrich Aff.\"), ¶ 2. The Seventh Circuit refers to the possibility of a \"class contract[ing] privately over\nattorneys' fees.\" In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig., 264 F.3d at 717. I have never seen such a contract.\n[15] One other problem has drawn attention in the caselaw and academic literature: Does an award at settlement\nthat is not limited by the statutory lodestar encourage acceptance of an early, inadequate settlement offer\nbecause of the richer incentive it provides class counsel? The answer is no, given the holdings of Gisbrecht and \nVenegas. According to those cases, a fee higher than the statutory recovery from the defendant, if appropriate, is\navailable from the plaintiffs either by contract or unjust enrichment even after judgment. See, e.g., Gobert, 323\nF.3d at 1100 (lawyer awarded 25% of client's recovery, as well as statutory lodestar assessed against defendant).\nOnce that availability is recognized, there is no need to agonize over what would otherwise be a perverse\nincentive to settle early, the concern of Brytus, 203 F.3d at 247, and Staton, 327 F.3d at 970. See also Martha\nPacold, Comment, Attorneys' Fees in Class Actions Governed by Fee-Shifting Statutes, 69 U. Chi. L.Rev. 1007,\n1008-09 (2001) (finding an \"enormous\" incentive for class counsel to settle at the expense of class members if\npercentage awards at settlement exceed lodestar fees at judgment). Given Venegas and Gisbrecht, lawyers\nreceiving a percentage-of-funds fee at settlement do not receive a \"windfall,\", as some commentators have\nsuggested, see Safranek, supra, at 1318.\n[16] The Second Circuit factors are: (1) the time and labor expended by counsel; (2) the magnitude and\ncomplexities of the litigation; (3) the risk of the litigation; (4) the quality of representation; (5) the requested fee in\nrelation to the settlement; and (6) public policy considerations. Goldberger, 209 F.3d at 50.\n[17] The Sixth Circuit factors are: (1) the value of the benefit rendered; (2) society's stake in rewarding attorneys\nwho produce such benefits in order to maintain the incentive to others; (3) whether the services were undertaken\non a contingent fee basis; (4) the value of the services on an hourly basis; (5) the complexity of the litigation; and\n(6) the professional skill and standing of counsel involved on both sides. Ramey, 508 F.2d at 1196. These factors\nare sometimes referred to as \"Rawlings factors\" and attributed to Rawlings v. Prudential-Bache Properties, Inc., 9\nF.3d 513, 516-17 (6th Cir.1993), although Rawlings did not explicate them. See Bowling v. Pfizer, Inc., 102 F.3d\n777, 780 (6th Cir.1996) (listing same factors and referring to them as \"Rawlings factors\"); In re Sulzer\nOrthopedics, Inc., 398 F.3d 778, 781 (6th Cir.2005) (referring to \"Rawlings factors\").\n[18] The Third Circuit factors are: (1) the size of the fund created and the number of persons benefited; (2) the\npresence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement terms and/or fees\nrequested by counsel; (3) the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved; (4) the complexity and duration of the\nlitigation; (5) the risk of nonpayment; (6) the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs' counsel; and (7)\nawards in similar cases. Gunter, 223 F.3d at 195 n. 1.\n[19] The Johnson factors are: (1) time and labor required; (2) novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) skill\nrequisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to\nacceptance of the case; (5) customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed\nby the client or the circumstances; (8) amount involved and results obtained; (9) experience, reputation, and\n\nability of the attorneys; (10) \"undesirability\" of the case; (11) nature and length of the professional relationship\nwith the client; (12) awards in similar cases. Johnson, 488 F.2d at 717-19.\n[20] The Fifth Circuit continues to use its own Johnson factors, but only as an adjustment to the lodestar figure, \nsee In re Cahill, 428 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir.2005); it appears to be the only circuit to prohibit use of the\npercentage method. See Strong v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 137 F.3d 844, 850 (5th Cir.1998) (\"[T]his circuit\nuses [the lodestar method] to assess attorneys' fees in class action suits.\"); but see Longden v. Sunderman, 979\nF.2d 1095, 1100 (5th Cir.1992) (approving of award also calculated by percentage as the district court \"merely\ndemonstrated its preference for that method as a matter of policy,\" and used both the percentage and lodestar\nmethods as alternatives at arriving at the same Johnson-evaluated dollar amount).\n[21] The Eleventh Circuit factors in addition to the Johnson factors are: (1) the time required to reach a\nsettlement; (2) whether there are any substantial objections by class members or other parties to the settlement\nterms or the fees requested by counsel; (3) any nonmonetary benefits conferred upon the class by the\nsettlement; (4) the economics involved in prosecuting a class action; and (5) other factors unique to a particular\ncase. Camden I Condo. Ass'n, 946 F.2d at 775.\n[22] The Third Circuit considers this one of the most important factors, along with \"complexity and duration\" of the\nlitigation. In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d at 301.\n[23] In fact, the only additional factors added are the Second Circuit's \"public policy\" factor, the Sixth Circuit's\nconsideration of \"maintaining the incentive for future lawyers,\" and the Johnson circuits'\"undesirability\" and\n\"preclusion of employment\" factors. (In Johnson jurisdictions, the factors of \"time limitations imposed,\" \"nature of\nthe professional relationship,\" and \"customary fee\" are presumably reflected in the \"lodestar\" factor.) Apart from\nthese differences, the multifactor tests are very similar. Further, the two jurisdictions that appear to rely primarily\non \"benchmark\" percentages or ranges could be characterized as merely using an abbreviated \"comparison to\nother awards\" factor.\n[24] In Vizcaino, the Ninth Circuit's most extensive treatment of the issue, the following circumstances considered\nby the district court were held to be relevant: (1) counsel's exceptional results; (2) riskiness of the case; (3)\nincidental or nonmonetary benefits conferred by the litigation; (4) retainer agreements with named plaintiffs,\nalthough not to a large degree; (5) lawyers' reasonable expectations, based on the case's circumstances and\nrange of fee awards in funds of comparable size; and (6) the burdens of representation on a contingency basis. \nVizcaino, 290 F.3d at 1048-50.\n[25] Necessarily, this approach would also consider how much the fund might be increased by the defendant's\nliability for fees.\n[26]But see supra note 14.\n[27] Unfortunately, in this sense judges have become the market. See Judith Resnik, Money Matters: Judicial\nMarket Interventions Creating Subsidies and Awarding Fees and Costs in Individual and Aggregate Litigation,\n148 U. Pa. L.Rev. 2119, 2129 (2000) (arguing that judges have \"the power of payment\" in aggregate litigation,\nthus alter demand and supply patterns, direct capital to subsidiary service providers, and shape lawyers'\nincentives and market positions, and that as a result, attorney fee awards should be subject to stronger\nregulation).\n[28] Another reason I do so is that under First Circuit law I could merely award the lodestar. In re Thirteen\nAppeals, 56 F.3d at 307. Since the lawyers have requested more, I believe it is critical to use an intelligible\nstandard to assess their request.\n[29] Because I reject a multifactor approach, I will not engage in a full analysis using the various tests employed\nby the Circuits. However, I attach to this ruling an abbreviated analysis using those factors that I have identified\nas common to all the jurisdictions. See Appendix I.\n[30] A district judge using the multifactor analysis has an instinctive notion, consciously or unconsciously, of what\nis an appropriate fee (a fee \"Gestalt,\" as it were). The multifactor analysis merely supports the judge's instinctive\n\nview. And on review, appellate courts then take comfort from the weighing and juggling of the various\nconsiderations. But the factors do not produce a result or even a substantive standard of reasonableness. At the\nvery least, the market-mimicking approach is situated outside the judge's Gestalt, in a somewhat more objective\nrealm. See1985 Task Force Report, 108 F.R.D. at 244-45; In re Cont'l Sec. Litig., 962 F.2d at 570 (\"[m]arkets\nknow market values better than judges do\").\n[31]Montgomery v. Aetna Plywood, Inc., 231 F.3d 399, 408 (7th Cir.2000): \nThis standard obviates, at least to a certain extent, the need to assign a value to an attorney's work based on\nnothing more than a subjective judgment regarding that work. It gives a court a background against which to work\nby requiring courts to look to evidence regarding the sorts of fees and costs generated in analogous suits funded\nby paying clients.\n[32] The Seventh Circuit often criticizes trial judges for failing to determine the market rate at the outset of the\ncase (ex ante). Here, it is too late to do so. But there are also good reasons why trial judges are reluctant to\nembrace this theoretically preferable approach. For one thing, there is even less likelihood of objectors at the\nbeginning of the case, so the judge is truly on his or her own in making a decision and knows instinctively that\nalthough Rule 23 makes no fee determination final until the case is over, it will be hard to lower the fee at the end\nafter perhaps years of attorney striving based upon the more rewarding premise. Second, to appreciate the risks\nof the case the judge will have to learn information from the plaintiff(s) that could prejudice that judge's ability to\nrule fairly on later motion practice. Perhaps that could be cured by using a different judge to set the fee in\nadvance, but that would add one more complexity to already complex litigation and perhaps make it even less\nlikely that objectors could successfully challenge the fee at the end of the case. Third, district judges are probably\nreluctant to play poker with plaintiff's counsel, risking the possibility that counsel will threaten to walk away from\nthe case if the fee set at the beginning is unsatisfactory.\n[33] I also recognize that choosing a market approach does not always guarantee a percentage-of-funds fee. The\nmarket may produce a fixed-fee approach or an hourly based fee.\n[34]See, e.g., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 396 F.3d at 123-24 (rejecting argument that fee arrangements reached with\nlead plaintiffs were best indicator of market rates, \"when settlement payments to [numerous] absent class\nmembers are at stake\"); Vizcaino, 290 F.3d at 1049 (holding that fee agreements \"although somewhat probative\nof a reasonable rate, are not particularly helpful,\" because they are made precertification and do not involve the\nclass, thus are nonbinding).\n[35] Many other states also place limits on contingency fees, both for medical malpractice claims and for other\nclaims. See, e.g., Okla. Stat. tit. 5, § 7 (2001) (contingency fees permitted up to maximum of 50%); Fla. Stat. §\n768.28(8) (2005) (limit of 25% upon contingency fees charged pursuant to a claim under state waiver of\nsovereign immunity); Cal. Bus. & Prof.Code § 6146 (2003) (medical malpractice claim sliding scale limitations of\n40% of first $50,000, 33.33% of next $50,000, 25% of next $500,000, and 15% of amount over $600,000).\n[36]See also Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Act, 38 U.S.C. § 1984(g) (2002) (10% of amount\nrecovered); International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, 22 U.S.C. § 1623(f) (2004) (10% of award); Trading with\nthe Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C.App. § 20 (1990) (10% of property, interest, or proceeds returned); Military and Civilian\nEmployees' Personnel Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3721(i) (2003) (10% of award); Commission on Wartime\nRelocation and Internment of Civilians Act, 50 U.S.C.App. § 1985 (1990) (10% of award).\n[37] A summary of the cases the research uncovered appears in Appendix II.\n[38]Actual percentages may be higher than this. Some settlement agreements I reviewed provide that unclaimed\nfunds will revert to the defendant; in such a situation, the percentage first, evaluated in relation to the total \npotential recovery for the plaintiff class should be re-evaluated in light of the actual recovery once all claims are\nprocessed. Thus, the attorney fees in Eddleman may have been a higher percentage of actual payout, as well as\nthose in Kahler See also Williams v. Block, No. 97-03826-CW (C.D. Ca. final approval of settlement Nov. 27,\n2002) (court explicitly awarded 20% of fund in that case, but also evaluated fee as percentage of total defendant\nliability from several related cases, and found the award then to be 35.7%). See Appendix II.\n\n[39]See also 4 Conte & Newberg, supra, § 14:6, (common fee awards normally fall between 20% and 33%);\nFederal Judicial Center, Manual for Complex Litigation, § 14.121 (\"Manual for Complex Litigation\") (4th ed.2004)\n(under the percentage method, attorney fees are often between 25% and 30%).\n[40] Arguably, a personal injury percentage is not a very good measure for a civil rights case. See Kirchoff v.\nFlynn, 786 F.2d 320, 323-24, 329-30 (7th Cir.1986) (majority and dissent disagree over whether experienced trial\njudge properly should have treated civil rights case as a simple false arrest and battery claim). This critique may\nbe particularly apt when a civil rights case is likely to result in mainly injunctive, rather than monetary, relief. A\nlawyer who agrees to litigate a case likely to result in injunctive relief would conceivably conduct arm's length\nnegotiation in a very different manner than the typical personal injury case; he or she might eschew the\npercentage-of-funds method entirely and instead opt for an hourly or flat-fee arrangement.\n[41] I do recognize that the fact that my award falls within the range of other judicial awards serves mostly to give\nme comfort against embarrassing comparisons. It does not really show what the lawyers would have agreed to in\nan arm's length negotiation. Like my fee award, most of those awards were not adversarially tested (unless there\nwere active and skilled objectors).\n[42] When Judges Posner and Easterbrook are not on the panel, the Seventh Circuit itself is somewhat less\ndemanding. See, e.g., Taubenfeld v. AON Corp., 415 F.3d 597, 600 (7th Cir.2005) (\"[A]n analysis of the strength\nof the class's case, data on fees awarded in other class actions in the jurisdiction, and evidence of the quality of\nlegal services rendered [was] the same type of evidence needed to mimic the market per Synthroid I. ...\"). Even\nJudge Easterbrook sometimes just gives up on the trial court and sets the fee himself, instead of remanding for a\nthird try, see, e.g., In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig., 325 F.3d 974, 980 (7th Cir.2003).\n[43] That has been the recommendation of two Third Circuit Task Forces. 2002 Task Force Report, 208 F.R.D. at\n420-21; 1985 Task Force Report, 108 F.R.D. at 255-56. Under Rule 23, however, no attorney fee computation\ncan be final until the reasonableness review at the end of the case. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23; see also 2002 Task Force\nReport, 208 F.R.D. at 420 (recognizing Rule 23 requirements).\n[44] The only fee-related objection was based on the erroneous assumption that class counsel had negotiated\nfees with the defendants prior to settlement. Order at 27. All the agreement provided was that class counsel could\nrequest the 30% from the court. Settlement Agreement 11 (Docket Item 168).\n[45] I do not include the lodestar multiplier of 0.98 of Williams v. Block, 97-03826-CW (S.D. Ca. final settlement\napproval Nov. 27, 2002), because in making the award, the judge explicitly relied on a different multiplier (2.24)\ncalculated in a different fashion. See Appendix II.\n[46] The court also analyzed the award as a percentage of the total monetary liability that the defendant had\nincurred in all related lawsuits. The lawyers had already received a $5.5 million fee from the defendant due to the\nsettlement of a related injunctive-relief case. Adding that fee award to the settlement fund obtained in Williams,\nthe judge found, brought the total liability of the defendant to $27.3 million, of which the two combined awards\nwere 35.47%. Counting both awards, the lodestar multiplier was 2.24.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This filing \nis strictly limited to responding to portions of Plaintiffs’ own objection to the \nMagistrate’s Recommended Decision on the Motion for Class Certification.  This filing \nassumes, of necessity, that the court will accept the Magistrate’s Recommended Decision \nover the Defendant’s objections, and is offered for the purpose of supporting so much of \nthe Recommended Decision as finds that certification under F.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) would be \nimproper.1 The Defendant maintains its prior objections to both the Motion for \nCertification and so much of the Recommended Decision as urges granting of parts of \nthat motion.   \n                                                 \n1   The Recommended Decision, in defining the scope of the proposed class, deleted references to visual \nbody cavity searches.  While the Defendant agrees that any class should not include within its description a \nreference to visual body cavity searches, no additional argument is offered here as Plaintiffs have not \nobjected to that portion of the Recommended Decision. \n  1 \n\n  Plaintiffs challenge two discrete portions of the Recommended Decision:  (1) that \nwhich recommends denying certification under F.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), and (2) that which \nsuggests that nominal Plaintiff Nilsen be stricken as a class representative.   \nA.  THE RECOMMENDED DECISION CORRECTLY CONCLUDED THAT\n      CERTIFICATION UNDER F.R.CIV.P 23(b)(2) WOULD BE IMPROPER\n      BECAUSE THE MONETARY DAMAGES SOUGHT IN THIS CASE FORM\n      THE PRIMARY REMEDY SOUGHT, AND ARE NOT MERELY\n      INCIDENTAL TO EQUITABLE RELIEF. \n \n  The Defendant originally objected to the certification under F.R.Civ.P. (23)(b)(2) \non the basis that the class representatives were not appropriate representatives of the \nclass, that they lacked standing to seek the relief available under that portion of the rule, \nand that the primary relief sought by the operative Complaint was monetary.  \nRecommended Decision at p.5 (hereafter “Rec.Dec., p.___”); Objection to Motion for \nCertification, pp. 14-22.  The Magistrate made his recommendation based exclusively on \nthe latter argument.  Rec.Dec. at p.5.  Notwithstanding the focused analysis of the \nRecommended Decision in this particular, Plaintiffs attempt to blur the focus by \nimbricating legal arguments on issues that (1) were not dispositive of the Recommended \nDecision, and (2) have been previously argued.  Specifically, Plaintiffs contend variously \nthat (1) the Defendant has acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, Plaintiffs’ \nObjection to Recommended Decision on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, p.3 \n(hereafter “Plaintiffs’ Objection, p.___”), (2) that declaratory and injunctive relief is \nnecessary because the alleged policy or custom continues in existence, id., (3) that the \nPlaintiffs have standing to seek equitable relief, Plaintiffs’ Objection, p. 4, and finally, (4) \nthat the claim for monetary damages does not preclude certification under F.R.Civ.P. \n23(b)(2). Plaintiffs’ Objection, p. 7. Because the Recommended Decision did not turn on \n  2 \n\nthe first three objections raised by Plaintiffs, there is no occasion to address those in this \nresponse.2\n  The Magistrate determined that the primary relief sought by plaintiffs is monetary \ndamages, that such damages are individual to each plaintiff, and that the only injunctive \nrelief sought is to enjoin the defendant from continuing an alleged unconstitutional \npolicy, and therefore concluded that the monetary damages were not merely incidental to \nthe claim for equitable relief, but rather were the primary driving force behind the action \nand were the predominant relief sought.  Based upon those determinations and \nconclusions, and based upon this Court’s decision in Ramirez v. DeCoster, 194 F.R.D. \n348 (D.Me. 2000), the Magistrate recommended denial of plaintiff’s motion for \ncertification under F.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). \n  Plaintiffs concede, by failing to submit argument to the contrary, that the primary \ndamages sought in this action are monetary.  Apparently acknowledging that certification \nunder F.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) is improper where monetary damages predominate, see Allison \nv. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d 402, 415 (5th Cir. 1998), Plaintiffs seek to circumvent \nthat rule by arguing that notice to proposed class members under the 23(b)(3) \ncertification removes the obstacle to 23(b)(2) certification.  Plaintiffs’ Objection, pp. 7-8.  \nPlaintiffs invite the court to reconsider its recent ruling in DeCoster, which followed the \nstandard established by the Firth Circuit in Allison.  Plaintiffs argue that the majority of \ncourts have rejected the Fifth Circuit’s position.  Plaintiffs’ Objection, p. 7.  In addition to \n                                                 \n2   The Magistrate’s Recommended Decision did correctly note, in passing, that it was “unlikely that \n[plaintiffs] will ever be arrested and detained again in the York County Jail.”  Rec.Dec., pp. 5-6. To the \nextent that this correct observation lends itself to the standing argument, the Defendant will briefly reiterate \nits position on that issue.  See, infra at 5. \n  3 \n\nignoring the fact that monetary damages predominate in this case, the Plaintiffs’ \nargument also fails on its own merits.   \nIn those circuits which have considered the issue, there is virtual unanimity that \ncertification under 23(b)(2) is inappropriate where monetary damages predominate.  The \nThird, Seventh, Tenth and Eleventh Circuits have all adopted the Firth Circuit’s approach \nas enunciated in Allison.  The Allison inquiry requires a determination as to whether the \ndamages flow directly from liability to the class as a whole (in which case they are \nincidental and do not create a bar to certification under 23(b)(2), or whether they require \nhearing to resolve the disparate merits of individual cases (in which case the predominate \nand do create a bar to certification under 23(b)(2). See generally, Polin v. Sears Roebuck \nCo., 231 F.3d 970, 975-76 (5th Circuit). \n  Because assessment of the individual damage claims in this case will require \nintroduction of evidence, and individual fact finding, with respect to the merits of each of \nthose claims3,  monetary damages predominate, and therefore preclude certification under \nRule 23(b)(2). \n  In addition to the five circuits which utilize the Allison analytical framework, at \nleast two other circuits have employed a different analytical paradigm, but one which \nnevertheless dictates the same result in this case.  Both the Second and Ninth Circuits \nemploy an “ad hoc” analysis to determine whether the predominate remedy sought in a \nclass action lawsuit is equitable or monetary. In Robertson v. Metro-North Commuter \nR.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147 (2nd Cir. 2001), cert denied, 122 S.Ct. 1349 (2002), the court \n                                                 \n3   This analysis will be necessary not only to determine the extent of those damages for purposes of \naffixing monetary damages, but also preliminarily as a threshold matter for the purpose of determining \nwhether those damages rise to a level sufficient to allow an award of damages that is more than nominal.  \nSee generally, Carey v. Piphus, 430 U.S. 964 (1977). \n  4 \n\ninquired as to whether a reasonable plaintiff, in the absence of monetary relief, would still \nseek to enforce the action to obtain equitable relief.  Under that analysis, it seems \nunlikely that reasonable plaintiffs would seek to maintain this action in the absence of \nmonetary relief.  Those members of the class would only stand to potentially benefit from \nthe maintenance of this action under Rule 23(b)(2) if they were again arrested, again \nincarcerated in the York County Jail, and again admitted into the general population of \nthe jail (as opposed to being bailed or otherwise released from holding/booking). \n  Whether the analytical paradigm offered by the Fifth Circuit is followed, or \nwhether that of the Second Circuit is followed, the result that obtains is the same: the \nprimary relief sought by Plaintiffs is monetary, and certification under Rule 23(b)(2 is \ntherefore precluded. \n  In the absence of some convincing argument by Plaintiffs that the primary action \nsought in this case is equitable and that any monetary damages obtained are merely \nincidental, the Magistrate’s Recommended Decision correctly concludes that certification \nunder Rule 23(b)(2) is improper. \nB.  MEMBERS OF THE PROPOSED CLASS DO NOT HAVE STANDING TO\n      SEEK EQUITABLE RELIEF BECAUSE IT IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY\n      THAT THEY WILL AGAIN BE INCARCERATED IN THE GENERAL\n      POPULATION OF THE YORK COUNTY JAIL. \n \n  Although not addressed in the Recommended Decision, Plaintiffs re-argue their \nposition with respect to standing to obtain equitable relief.  Because the Magistrate’s \nRecommended Decision made passing reference to the unlikelihood that members of the \nclass will again be incarcerated in the York County Jail, Defendant offers a brief response \nto Plaintiffs’ argument, in addition to that which is contained in its Objection to the \nMotion for Certification.   \n  5 \n\n  Plaintiffs premise their entire standing argument on the following predicates:  (1) \npeople with criminal records are more vulnerable to arrest and more likely to be detained \nthan people without criminal histories, (2) that if an individual is arrested in York County \nthey will be strip searched, and (3) that the court can take judicial notice that a significant \nnumber of people who are arrested are repeat offenders likely to be arrested again and, if \narrested and held in York County, likely to be strip searched.  Plaintiffs’ Objection, pp. 4, \n5.  The facts upon which Plaintiffs’ standing argument are based are not supported by the \nrecord. \n  First, Plaintiffs offer no evidence, statistical, empirical, or otherwise, to support \nthe proposition that people with criminal records are more vulnerable to arrest and are \nmore likely to be detained than those without criminal histories.  Plaintiffs cite, as their \nsole authority for that proposition, a case from Massachusetts. Plaintiffs offer no \narticulation of the facts of that case in an attempt to analogize them to the facts of this \ncase.   Without such articulation, the parallel which Plaintiffs seek to draw is \nunsupported. \n  Second, simply because someone is arrested in York County does not mean that \nthey are going to be brought to the York County Jail and does not mean that they are \ngoing to be searched.  Plaintiffs again fail to offer any evidence of any sort demonstrating \nwhat percentage of people arrested in York County are actually detained at the York \nCounty Jail.  Plaintiffs do not offer any sort of authority for this proposition. \n  Third, Plaintiffs misconstrue the circumstances under which a court may take \njudicial notice of a fact. “Judicial notice” is a construct of the rules of evidence, and does \nnot exist in the abstract.  Specifically, F.R.Evid. 201 governs circumstances under which \n  6 \n\na court may take judicial notice of an adjudicative fact.  Specifically, “[a] judicially \nnoticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally \nknown within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and \nready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be \nquestioned.  F.R.Evid. 201 (emphasis added). \n  Once again, Plaintiffs offer no evidence and point to no sources to support the \n“fact” which they ask the court to take judicial notice of.  It is respectfully submitted that \nit would not even be within the court’s discretion to take judicial notice that a \n“significant” number of  people who are arrested are repeat offenders, are likely to be \narrested again, are likely to be held in York County, and are likely to be strip searched. \n  Plaintiffs have not offered any persuasive reasoning as to why certification under \n23(b)(2) would be proper in view of the fact that they concede that the primary damages \nsought are monetary.  To the extent that the Court certifies a class in this action, it should \nnot do so under Rule 23(b)(2). \nC.  THE MAGISTRATE’S REFERENCE TO STRIKING MICHELE NILSEN AS\n      A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CLASS WAS NOT A SPECIFIC\n      RECOMMENDATION AND THE PLAINTIFFS’ OBJECTION THERETO IS\n      NOT RIPE AT THIS JUNCTURE. \n \n  In a footnote, the Magistrate suggested that striking Michele Nilsen as a \nrepresentative of the class would be an appropriate manner in which to resolve the \nconflict regarding the specific factual circumstances of her claims.  The Magistrate did \nnot specifically recommend that the Court do so.  Although the Defendant may file a \nmotion to strike Ms. Nilsen as a representative of the class in the future, it has not \npresently filed such a motion and the issue is not before the court vis a vis the \nRecommended Decision.  Given that there are two other representatives of the proposed \n  7 \n\nclass, striking Ms. Nilsen would appear to be more of a housekeeping function than a \ndetermination that would affect the merits of the overall case. \n  For all of the foregoing reasons, to the extent that the Court determines that it is \ngoing to certify this action as recommended by the Magistrate, its certification should be \nconsistent with the Magistrate’s Recommended Decision, and should be limited to \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3). \nDated:  October 14, 2003    Attorneys for Defendant \n       W HEELER & AREY, P.A. \n    27 Temple Street, P.O.

The plaintiffs' counsel has provided notice to the class as ordered by the Court and the class members have\nreceived proper notice of the settlement.\n2. The parties have amended their settlement to provide equal settlement payments to male and female class\nmembers, and to provide a new opportunity for female class members who have filed claims to opt out.\n3. The Second Amended Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable and adequate, and provides proper notice of\noptout rights for the reasons stated in the August 18, 2005, Order. Therefore, final approval of the settlement is\nGRANTED.\n4. The distribution plan and the further opt-out notice, attached as Exhibit G to the Second Amended Settlement\nAgreement, are APPROVED.\n5. I APPROVE the incentive awards to compensate the three class representatives and seventeen class member\nwho spent time working with class counsel to achieve the settlement in the following amounts: $6,500 to Michele\nNilsen, $5,500 to Charles Neville, $5,000 to Michael Goodrich, and $500 to each of the seventeen deposed class\nmembers, for a total of $25,500.\n6. It is ORDERED that, within seven (7) days from the date of this Order, the claims administrator shall process\nall timely settlement claim forms to determine whether the claimant is a class member, and send by first class\nmail, postage prepaid, a Notice of Claim Approval to all claimants who are verified as class members and a\nNotice of Claim Denial to all claimants who cannot be verified as class members. The Notice of Claim Denial\nshall inform the claimant of the reason for the denial to the extent possible. The Notice of Claim Denial shall\ninform claimant of the availability of an appeal and the time within which an appeal must be made. It is further\nORDERED that, within seven (7) days from the date of this Order, the claims administrator shall send by first\nclass mail, postage prepaid, the Opt Out Notice, attached as Exhibit G to the Second Amended Settlement\n\n266 Agreement, to all female claimants who filed timely settlement claim forms, consistent with paragraph *266 43A of\nthe Second Amended Settlement Agreement.\n7. It is further ORDERED that the administration of the settlement shall comply with the following deadlines:\na. Claimants who wish to appeal from a Notice of Claim Denial must file a written appeal with the claims\nadministrator postmarked no later than two (2) weeks from the date the Notice of Claim Denial was mailed\n(Appeal Deadline).\nb. The claims administrator shall resolve all class member appeals and send written notice to claimants of its final\ndecision no later than four (4) weeks from the Appeal Deadline. If the decision is adverse to the claimant, the\nNotice of Appeal Decision will inform the claimant of his or her right to appeal to the Court, and that the claimant's\nnotice of appeal shall include a copy of the claims administrator's decision denying the appeal.\nc. Claimants who wish to appeal the claims administrator's final decision to the Court shall file a notice of appeal\nwith the Court postmarked no later than two (2) weeks from the date the final decision was mailed by the claims\nadministrator.\nd. After receiving notice, the claims administrator may file a response with the Court within five (5) days as\ncalculated under Fed.R.Civ.P. 6.\n8. The claims administrator shall pay all incentive bonuses, litigation costs, claims administration expenses and\nattorney fees, and distribute settlement payments to class members pursuant to the distribution plan no later than\nfourteen (14) days after the Court resolves the last appeal.\n9. The claims administrator shall submit to plaintiffs' counsel a final accounting of the settlement fund distribution\nwithin sixty (60) days from the date of distribution.\n10. The plaintiffs' counsel shall file a final report of the settlement within sixty (60) days from receiving the claims\nadministrator's final accounting.\nSO ORDERED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
